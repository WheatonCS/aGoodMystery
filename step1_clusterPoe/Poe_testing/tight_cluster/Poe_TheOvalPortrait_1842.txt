the chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance

rather than permit me in my desperately wounded condition to pass a

night in the open air was one of those piles of commingled gloom and

grandeur which have so long frowned among the appennines not less in

fact than in the fancy of mrs radcliffe to all appearance it had been

temporarily and very lately abandoned we established ourselves in one

of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments it lay in a

remote turret of the building its decorations were rich yet tattered

and antique its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with

manifold and multiform armorial trophies together with an unusually

great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden

arabesque in these paintings which depended from the walls not only

in their main surfaces but in very many nooks which the bizarre

architecture of the chateau rendered necessary in these paintings my

incipient delirium perhaps had caused me to take deep interest so

that i bade pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room since it was

already night to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by

the head of my bed and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains

of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself i wished all this done

that i might resign myself if not to sleep at least alternately to the

contemplation of these pictures and the perusal of a small volume which

had been found upon the pillow and which purported to criticise and

describe them



long long i read and devoutly devotedly i gazed rapidly and

gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came the position of

the candelabrum displeased me and outreaching my hand with difficulty

rather than disturb my slumbering valet i placed it so as to throw its

rays more fully upon the book



but the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated the rays of

the numerous candles for there were many now fell within a niche of

the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the

bed-posts i thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before it

was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood i glanced

at the painting hurriedly and then closed my eyes why i did this

was not at first apparent even to my own perception but while my lids

remained thus shut i ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting

them it was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought to make

sure that my vision had not deceived me to calm and subdue my fancy for

a more sober and more certain gaze in a very few moments i again looked

fixedly at the painting



that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt for the first

flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the

dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses and to startle me at

once into waking life



the portrait i have already said was that of a young girl it was a

mere head and shoulders done in what is technically termed a vignette

manner much in the style of the favorite heads of sully the arms the

bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into

the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole the

frame was oval richly gilded and filigreed in moresque as a thing of

art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself but it

could have been neither the execution of the work nor the immortal

beauty of the countenance which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved

me least of all could it have been that my fancy shaken from its half

slumber had mistaken the head for that of a living person i saw at

once that the peculiarities of the design of the vignetting and of the

frame must have instantly dispelled such idea must have prevented even

its momentary entertainment thinking earnestly upon these points i

remained for an hour perhaps half sitting half reclining with my

vision riveted upon the portrait at length satisfied with the true

secret of its effect i fell back within the bed i had found the spell

of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression which at

first startling finally confounded subdued and appalled me with deep

and reverent awe i replaced the candelabrum in its former position the

cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view i sought eagerly

the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories turning

to the number which designated the oval portrait i there read the vague

and quaint words which follow



she was a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full of

glee and evil was the hour when she saw and loved and wedded the

painter he passionate studious austere and having already a bride

in his art she a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full

of glee all light and smiles and frolicsome as the young fawn loving

and cherishing all things hating only the art which was her rival

dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments

which deprived her of the countenance of her lover it was thus a

terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to

portray even his young bride but she was humble and obedient and sat

meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber where the light

dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead but he the painter

took glory in his work which went on from hour to hour and from day to

day and he was a passionate and wild and moody man who became lost

in reveries so that he would not see that the light which fell so

ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his

bride who pined visibly to all but him yet she smiled on and still on

uncomplainingly because she saw that the painter who had high renown

took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task and wrought day and

night to depict her who so loved him yet who grew daily more dispirited

and weak and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its

resemblance in low words as of a mighty marvel and a proof not less of

the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted

so surpassingly well but at length as the labor drew nearer to its

conclusion there were admitted none into the turret for the painter

had grown wild with the ardor of his work and turned his eyes from

canvas merely even to regard the countenance of his wife and he would

not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from

the cheeks of her who sate beside him and when many weeks had passed

and but little remained to do save one brush upon the mouth and one

tint upon the eye the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the

flame within the socket of the lamp and then the brush was given

and then the tint was placed and for one moment the painter stood

entranced before the work which he had wrought but in the next while

he yet gazed he grew tremulous and very pallid and aghast and crying

with a loud voice this is indeed life itself turned suddenly to

regard his beloved she was dead

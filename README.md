# aGoodMystery
This repo is a collection of computational methods to explore whether an 1831 story
published under the attribution of only 'P' might have been written by Edgar Allan Poe.
Rather than make sweeping claims of authorship, our goal is to share our methods 
to further this and other like questions and to facilitate the replication of results.

We present a workflow of steps that were taken to probe the question, including:
unsupervised (cluster analyses) and supervised (classification) methods.

Note: To facilitate replication of individual analyses for each step, we have included .zip versions of
the texts used in that analysis along with the source code. Cloning this repo will thus result
in duplication of text files.

Tools and packages used (but not included here):
- Lexos (https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos)
- Stylo in R (https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo)

the sketch book

the author's account of himself

i am of this mind with homer that as the snaile that crept out of her
shel was turned eftsoones into a toad i and thereby was forced to make a
stoole to sit on so the traveller that stragleth from his owne country
is in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape that he is
faine to alter his mansion with his manners and to live where he can
not where he would lyly's euphues

i was always fond of visiting new scenes and observing strange
characters and manners even when a mere child i began my travels and
made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of
my native city to the frequent alarm of my parents and the emolument
of the town crier as i grew into boyhood i extended the range of my
observations my holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the
surrounding country i made myself familiar with all its places famous
in history or fable i knew every spot where a murder or robbery had
been committed or a ghost seen i visited the neighboring villages
and added greatly to my stock of knowledge by noting their habits and
customs and conversing with their sages and great men i even journeyed
one long summer's day to the summit of the most distant hill whence i
stretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita and was astonished
to find how vast a globe i inhabited

this rambling propensity strengthened with my years books of voyages
and travels became my passion and in devouring their contents i
neglected the regular exercises of the school how wistfully would
i wander about the pier-heads in fine weather and watch the parting
ships bound to distant climes with what longing eyes would i gaze
after their lessening sails and waft myself in imagination to the ends
of the earth

further reading and thinking though they brought this vague inclination
into more reasonable bounds only served to make it more decided i
visited various parts of my own country and had i been merely a lover
of fine scenery i should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere
its gratification for on no country had the charms of nature been more
prodigally lavished her mighty lakes her oceans of liquid silver her
mountains with their bright aerial tints her valleys teeming with
wild fertility her tremendous cataracts thundering in their solitudes
her boundless plains waving with spontaneous verdure her broad deep
rivers rolling in solemn silence to the ocean her trackless forests
where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence her skies kindling
with the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine no never need
an american look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of
natural scenery

but europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical
association there were to be seen the masterpieces of art the
refinements of highly cultivated society the quaint peculiarities
of ancient and local custom my native country was full of youthful
promise europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age her very
ruins told the history of the times gone by and every mouldering
stone was a chronicle i longed to wander over the scenes of renowned
achievement to tread as it were in the footsteps of antiquity to
loiter about the ruined castle to meditate on the falling tower to
escape in short from the commonplace realities of the present and
lose myself among the shadowy grandeurs of the past

i had besides all this an earnest desire to see the great men of the
earth we have it is true our great men in america not a city but has
an ample share of them i have mingled among them in my time and been
almost withered by the shade into which they cast me for there
is nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great one
particularly the great man of a city but i was anxious to see the great
men of europe for i had read in the works of various philosophers that
all animals degenerated in america and man among the number a great
man of europe thought i must therefore be as superior to a great man
of america as a peak of the alps to a highland of the hudson and in
this idea i was confirmed by observing the comparative importance and
swelling magnitude of many english travellers among us who i was
assured were very little people in their own country i will visit this
land of wonders thought i and see the gigantic race from which i am
degenerated

it has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion
gratified i have wandered through different countries and witnessed
many of the shifting scenes of life i cannot say that i have studied
them with the eye of a philosopher but rather with the sauntering gaze
with which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll from the window
of one print-shop to another caught sometimes by the delineations of
beauty sometimes by the distortions of caricature and sometimes by
the loveliness of landscape as it is the fashion for modern tourists
to travel pencil in hand and bring home their portfolios filled with
sketches i am disposed to get up a few for the entertainment of my
friends when however i look over the hints and memorandums i have
taken down for the purpose my heart almost fails me at finding how
my idle humor has led me astray from the great object studied by every
regular traveller who would make a book i fear i shall give equal
disappointment with an unlucky landscape-painter who had travelled on
the continent but following the bent of his vagrant inclination had
sketched in nooks and corners and by-places his sketch-book was
accordingly crowded with cottages and landscapes and obscure ruins
but he had neglected to paint st peter's or the coliseum the cascade
of terni or the bay of naples and had not a single glacier or volcano
in his whole collection




the voyage

 ships ships i will descrie you
 amidst the main
 i will come and try you
 what you are protecting
 and projecting
 what's your end and aim
 one goes abroad for merchandise and trading
 another stays to keep his country from invading
 a third is coming home with rich and wealthy lading
 hallo my fancie whither wilt thou go
 old poem

to an american visiting europe the long voyage he has to make is an
excellent preparative the temporary absence of worldly scenes and
employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive
new and vivid impressions the vast space of waters that separate the
hemispheres is like a blank page in existence there is no gradual
transition by which as in europe the features and population of one
country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another from the
moment you lose sight of the land you have left all is vacancy until
you step on the opposite shore and are launched at once into the bustle
and novelties of another world

in travelling by land there is a continuity of scene and a connected
succession of persons and incidents that carry on the story of life
and lessen the effect of absence and separation we drag it is true
a lengthening chain at each remove of our pilgrimage but the chain is
unbroken we can trace it back link by link and we feel that the last
still grapples us to home but a wide sea voyage severs us at once
it makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of
settled life and sent adrift upon a doubtful world it interposes a
gulf not merely imaginary but real between us and our homes a
gulf subject to tempest and fear and uncertainty rendering distance
palpable and return precarious

such at least was the case with myself as i saw the last blue lines
of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon it seemed as if
i had closed one volume of the world and its concerns and had time for
meditation before i opened another that land too now vanishing from
my view which contained all most dear to me in life what vicissitudes
might occur in it what changes might take place in me before i should
visit it again who can tell when he sets forth to wander whither he
may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence or when he may
return or whether it may be ever his lot to revisit the scenes of his
childhood

i said that at sea all is vacancy i should correct the impression to
one given to day-dreaming and fond of losing himself in reveries a sea
voyage is full of subjects for meditation but then they are the wonders
of the deep and of the air and rather tend to abstract the mind from
worldly themes i delighted to loll over the quarter-railing or climb to
the main-top of a calm day and muse for hours together on the tranquil
bosom of a summer's sea to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just
peering above the horizon fancy them some fairy realms and people
them with a creation of my own to watch the gently undulating billows
rolling their silver volumes as if to die away on those happy shores

there was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with which i
looked down from my giddy height on the monsters of the deep at their
uncouth gambols shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship
the grampus slowly heaving his huge form above the surface or the
ravenous shark darting like a spectre through the blue waters my
imagination would conjure up all that i had heard or read of the watery
world beneath me of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys
of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the
earth and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and
sailors

sometimes a distant sail gliding along the edge of the ocean would be
another theme of idle speculation how interesting this fragment of a
world hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence what a glorious
monument of human invention which has in a manner triumphed over
wind and wave has brought the ends of the world into communion has
established an interchange of blessings pouring into the sterile
regions of the north all the luxuries of the south has diffused the
light of knowledge and the charities of cultivated life and has thus
bound together those scattered portions of the human race between which
nature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier

we one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance at
sea every thing that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse
attracts attention it proved to be the mast of a ship that must have
been completely wrecked for there were the remains of handkerchiefs by
which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar to prevent
their being washed off by the waves there was no trace by which the
name of the ship could be ascertained the wreck had evidently drifted
about for many months clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it and
long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides but where thought i is the crew
their struggle has long been over they have gone down amidst the roar
of the tempest their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep
silence oblivion like the waves have closed over them and no one
can tell the story of their end what sighs have been wafted after that
ship what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home how
often has the mistress the wife the mother pored over the daily news
to catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep how has
expectation darkened into anxiety anxiety into dread and dread into
despair alas not one memento may ever return for love to cherish all
that may ever be known is that she sailed from her port and was never
heard of more

the sight of this wreck as usual gave rise to many dismal anecdotes
this was particularly the case in the evening when the weather which
had hitherto been fair began to look wild and threatening and gave
indications of one of those sudden storms that will sometimes break in
upon the serenity of a summer voyage as we sat round the dull light of
a lamp in the cabin that made the gloom more ghastly everyone had his
tale of shipwreck and disaster i was particularly struck with a short
one related by the captain

as i was once sailing said he in a fine stout ship across the
banks of newfoundland one of those heavy fogs that prevail in those
parts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead even in the
daytime but at night the weather was so thick that we could not
distinguish any object at twice the length of the ship i kept lights
at the mast-head and a constant watch forward to look out for fishing
smacks which are accustomed to anchor of the banks the wind was
blowing a smacking breeze and we were going at a great rate through
the water suddenly the watch gave the alarm of a sail ahead it was
scarcely uttered before we were upon her she was a small schooner at
anchor with her broadside toward us the crew were all asleep and had
neglected to hoist a light we struck her just amidships the force the
size and weight of our vessel bore her down below the waves we passed
over her and were hurried on our course as the crashing wreck was
sinking beneath us i had a glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches
rushing from her cabin they just started from their beds to be
swallowed shrieking by the waves i heard their drowning cry mingling
with the wind the blast that bore it to our ears swept us out of all
further hearing i shall never forget that cry it was some time before
we could put the ship about she was under such headway we returned as
nearly as we could guess to the place where the smack had anchored we
cruised about for several hours in the dense fog we fired signal-guns
and listened if we might hear the halloo of any survivors but all was
silent we never saw or heard any thing of them more

i confess these stories for a time put an end to all my fine fancies
the storm increased with the night the sea was lashed into tremendous
confusion there was a fearful sullen sound of rushing waves and broken
surges deep called unto deep at times the black volume of clouds
overhead seemed rent asunder by flashes of lightning which quivered
along the foaming billows and made the succeeding darkness doubly
terrible the thunders bellowed over the wild waste of waters and were
echoed and prolonged by the mountain waves as i saw the ship staggering
and plunging among these roaring caverns it seemed miraculous that she
regained her balance or preserved her buoyancy her yards would dip
into the water her bow was almost buried beneath the waves sometimes
an impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm her and nothing but a
dexterous movement of the helm preserved her from the shock

when i retired to my cabin the awful scene still followed me the
whistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like funereal
wailings the creaking of the masts the straining and groaning of
bulkheads as the ship labored in the weltering sea were frightful as
i heard the waves rushing along the side of the ship and roaring in my
very ear it seemed as if death were raging around this floating prison
seeking for his prey the mere starting of a nail the yawning of a
seam might give him entrance

a fine day however with a tranquil sea and favoring breeze soon put
all these dismal reflections to flight it is impossible to resist the
gladdening influence of fine weather and fair wind at sea when the ship
is decked out in all her canvas every sail swelled and careering gayly
over the curling waves how lofty how gallant she appears how she
seems to lord it over the deep

i might fill a volume with the reveries of a sea voyage for with me it
is almost a continual reverie but it is time to get to shore

it was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of land was given
from the mast-head none but those who have experienced it can form an
idea of the delicious throng of sensations which rush into an american's
bosom when he first comes in sight of europe there is a volume of
associations with the very name it is the land of promise teeming with
everything of which his childhood has heard or on which his studious
years have pondered

from that time until the moment of arrival it was all feverish
excitement the ships of war that prowled like guardian giants along
the coast the headlands of ireland stretching out into the channel
the welsh mountains towering into the clouds all were objects of
intense interest as we sailed up the mersey i reconnoitred the shores
with a telescope my eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages with their
trim shrubberies and green grass-plots i saw the mouldering ruin of an
abbey overrun with ivy and the taper spire of a village church rising
from the brow of a neighboring hill all were characteristic of
england

the tide and wind were so favorable that the ship was enabled to come
at once to her pier it was thronged with people some idle lookers-on
others eager expectants of friends or relations i could distinguish
the merchant to whom the ship was consigned i knew him by his
calculating brow and restless air his hands were thrust into his
pockets he was whistling thoughtfully and walking to and fro a
small space having been accorded him by the crowd in deference to his
temporary importance there were repeated cheerings and salutations
interchanged between the shore and the ship as friends happened to
recognize each other i particularly noticed one young woman of humble
dress but interesting demeanor she was leaning forward from among the
crowd her eye hurried over the ship as it neared the shore to catch
some wished-for countenance she seemed disappointed and sad when i
heard a faint voice call her name it was from a poor sailor who had
been ill all the voyage and had excited the sympathy of every one on
board when the weather was fine his messmates had spread a mattress
for him on deck in the shade but of late his illness had so increased
that he had taken to his hammock and only breathed a wish that he might
see his wife before he died he had been helped on deck as we came up
the river and was now leaning against the shrouds with a countenance
so wasted so pale so ghastly that it was no wonder even the eye of
affection did not recognize him but at the sound of his voice her eye
darted on his features it read at once a whole volume of sorrow she
clasped her hands uttered a faint shriek and stood wringing them in
silent agony

all now was hurry and bustle the meetings of acquaintances the
greetings of friends the consultations of men of business i alone was
solitary and idle i had no friend to meet no cheering to receive i
stepped upon the land of my forefathers but felt that i was a stranger
in the land




roscoe

 in the service of mankind to be
 a guardian god below still to employ
 the mind's brave ardor in heroic aims
 such as may raise us o'er the grovelling herd
 and make us shine for ever that is life
 thomson

one of the first places to which a stranger is taken in liverpool is
the athenaeum it is established on a liberal and judicious plan it
contains a good library and spacious reading-room and is the great
literary resort of the place go there at what hour you may you are
sure to find it filled with grave-looking personages deeply absorbed in
the study of newspapers

as i was once visiting this haunt of the learned my attention was
attracted to a person just entering the room he was advanced in life
tall and of a form that might once have been commanding but it was
a little bowed by time perhaps by care he had a noble roman style of
countenance a a head that would have pleased a painter and though some
slight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought had been busy
there yet his eye beamed with the fire of a poetic soul there was
something in his whole appearance that indicated a being of a different
order from the bustling race round him

i inquired his name and was informed that it was roscoe i drew back
with an involuntary feeling of veneration this then was an author of
celebrity this was one of those men whose voices have gone forth to
the ends of the earth with whose minds i have communed even in the
solitudes of america accustomed as we are in our country to know
european writers only by their works we cannot conceive of them as of
other men engrossed by trivial or sordid pursuits and jostling with
the crowd of common minds in the dusty paths of life they pass before
our imaginations like superior beings radiant with the emanations of
their genius and surrounded by a halo of literary glory

to find therefore the elegant historian of the medici mingling among
the busy sons of traffic at first shocked my poetical ideas but it is
from the very circumstances and situation in which he has been placed
that mr roscoe derives his highest claims to admiration it is
interesting to notice how some minds seem almost to create themselves
springing up under every disadvantage and working their solitary but
irresistible way through a thousand obstacles nature seems to delight
in disappointing the assiduities of art with which it would rear
legitimate dulness to maturity and to glory in the vigor and luxuriance
of her chance productions she scatters the seeds of genius to the
winds and though some may perish among the stony places of the world
and some be choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity yet
others will now and then strike root even in the clefts of the rock
struggle bravely up into sunshine and spread over their sterile
birthplace all the beauties of vegetation

such has been the case with mr roscoe born in a place apparently
ungenial to the growth of literary talent in the very market-place of
trade without fortune family connections or patronage self-prompted
self-sustained and almost self-taught he has conquered every obstacle
achieved his way to eminence and having become one of the ornaments of
the nation has turned the whole force of his talents and influence to
advance and embellish his native town

indeed it is this last trait in his character which has given him the
greatest interest in my eyes and induced me particularly to point him
out to my countrymen eminent as are his literary merits he is but one
among the many distinguished authors of this intellectual nation
they however in general live but for their own fame or their own
pleasures their private history presents no lesson to the world or
perhaps a humiliating one of human frailty or inconsistency at best
they are prone to steal away from the bustle and commonplace of busy
existence to indulge in the selfishness of lettered eas and to revel
in scenes of mental but exclusive enjoyment

mr roscoe on the contrary has claimed none of the accorded privileges
of talent he has shut himself up in no garden of thought nor elysium
of fancy but has gone forth into the highways and thoroughfares of
life he has planted bowers by the wayside for the refreshment of the
pilgrim and the sojourner and has opened pure fountains where the
laboring man may turn aside from the dust and heat of the day and drink
of the living streams of knowledge there is a daily beauty in his
life on which mankind may meditate and grow better it exhibits no
lofty and almost useless because inimitable example of excellence but
presents a picture of active yet simple and imitable virtues which are
within every man's reach but which unfortunately are not exercised by
many or this world would be a paradise

but his private life is peculiarly worthy the attention of the citizens
of our young and busy country where literature and the elegant arts
must grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily necessity
and must depend for their culture not on the exclusive devotion of time
and wealth nor the quickening rays of titled patronage but on
hours and seasons snatched from the purest of worldly interests by
intelligent and public-spirited individuals

he has shown how much may be done for a place in hours of leisure by
one master-spirit and how completely it can give its own impress to
surrounding objects like his own lorenzo de medici on whom he
seems to have fixed his eye as on a pure model of antiquity he has
interwoven the history of his life with the history of his native town
and has made the foundations of his fame the monuments of his virtues
wherever you go in liverpool you perceive traces of his footsteps in
all that is elegant and liberal he found the tide of wealth flowing
merely in the channels of traffic he has diverted from it invigorating
rills to refresh the garden of literature by his own example and
constant exertions he has effected that union of commerce and the
intellectual pursuits so eloquently recommended in one of his latest
writings and has practically proved how beautifully they may be
brought to harmonize and to benefit each other the noble institutions
for literary and scientific purposes which reflect such credit on
liverpool and are giving such an impulse to the public mind have
mostly been originated and have all been effectively promoted by
mr roscoe and when we consider the rapidly increasing opulence and
magnitude of that town which promises to vie in commercial importance
with the metropolis it will be perceived that in awakening an ambition
of mental improvement among its inhabitants he has effected a great
benefit to the cause of british literature


 address on the opening of the liverpool institution


in america we know mr roscoe only as the author in liverpool he is
spoken of as the banker and i was told of his having been unfortunate
in business i could not pity him as i heard some rich men do i
considered him far above the reach of pity those who live only for the
world and in the world may be cast down by the frowns of adversity
but a man like roscoe is not to be overcome by the reverses of fortune
they do but drive him in upon the resources of his own mind to the
superior society of his own thoughts which the best of men are apt
sometimes to neglect and to roam abroad in search of less worthy
associates he is independent of the world around him he lives with
antiquity and with posterity with antiquity in the sweet communion of
studious retirement and with posterity in the generous aspirings
after future renown the solitude of such a mind is its state of highest
enjoyment it is then visited by those elevated meditations which
are the proper aliment of noble souls and are like manna sent from
heaven in the wilderness of this world

while my feelings were yet alive on the subject it was my fortune
to light on further traces of mr roscoe i was riding out with a
gentleman to view the environs of liverpool when he turned off
through a gate into some ornamented grounds after riding a short
distance we came to a spacious mansion of freestone built in the
grecian style it was not in the purest style yet it had an air of
elegance and the situation was delightful a fine lawn sloped away from
it studded with clumps of trees so disposed as to break a soft fertile
country into a variety of landscapes the mersey was seen winding a
broad quiet sheet of water through an expanse of green meadow land
while the welsh mountains blended with clouds and melting into
distance bordered the horizon

this was roscoe's favorite residence during the days of his prosperity
it had been the seat of elegant hospitality and literary retirement the
house was now silent and deserted i saw the windows of the study which
looked out upon the soft scenery i have mentioned the windows were
closed the library was gone two or three ill-favored beings were
loitering about the place whom my fancy pictured into retainers of the
law it was like visiting some classic fountain that had once welled
its pure waters in a sacred shade but finding it dry and dusty with
the lizard and the toad brooding over the shattered marbles

i inquired after the fate of mr roscoe's library which had consisted
of scarce and foreign books from many of which he had drawn the
materials for his italian histories it had passed under the hammer of
the auctioneer and was dispersed about the country the good people
of the vicinity thronged liked wreckers to get some part of the
noble vessel that had been driven on shore did such a scene admit of
ludicrous associations we might imagine something whimsical in this
strange irruption in the regions of learning pigmies rummaging the
armory of a giant and contending for the possession of weapons which
they could not wield we might picture to ourselves some knot of
speculators debating with calculating brow over the quaint binding and
illuminated margin of an obsolete author of the air of intense but
baffled sagacity with which some successful purchaser attempted to dive
into the black-letter bargain he had secured

it is a beautiful incident in the story of mr roscoe's misfortunes and
one which cannot fail to interest the studious mind that the parting
with his books seems to have touched upon his tenderest feelings and
to have been the only circumstance that could provoke the notice of
his muse the scholar only knows how dear these silent yet eloquent
companions of pure thoughts and innocent hours become in the season of
adversity when all that is worldly turns to dross around us these only
retain their steady value when friends grow cold and the converse of
intimates languishes into vapid civility and commonplace these only
continue the unaltered countenance of happier days and cheer us with
that true friendship which never deceived hope nor deserted sorrow

i do not wish to censure but surely if the people of liverpool had
been properly sensible of what was due to mr roscoe and themselves his
library would never have been sold good worldly reasons may doubtless
be given for the circumstance which it would be difficult to combat
with others that might seem merely fanciful but it certainly appears
to me such an opportunity as seldom occurs of cheering a noble mind
struggling under misfortunes by one of the most delicate but most
expressive tokens of public sympathy it is difficult however to
estimate a man of genius properly who is daily before our eyes he
becomes mingled and confounded with other men his great qualities lose
their novelty we become too familiar with the common materials which
form the basis even of the loftiest character some of mr roscoe's
townsmen may regard him merely as a man of business others as
a politician all find him engaged like themselves in ordinary
occupations and surpassed perhaps by themselves on some points of
worldly wisdom even that amiable and unostentatious simplicity of
character which gives the nameless grace to real excellence may cause
him to be undervalued by some coarse minds who do not know that true
worth is always void of glare and pretension but the man of letters
who speaks of liverpool speaks of it as the residence of roscoe the
intelligent traveller who visits it inquires where roscoe is to be seen
he is the literary landmark of the place indicating its existence to
the distant scholar he is like pompey's column at alexandria towering
alone in classic dignity

the following sonnet addressed by mr roscoe to his books on parting
with them has already been alluded to if anything can add effect
to the pure feeling and elevated thought here displayed it is the
conviction that the who leis no effusion of fancy but a faithful
transcript from the writer's heart

 to my books

 as one who destined from his friends to part
 regrets his loss but hopes again erewhile
 to share their converse and enjoy their smile
 and tempers as he may affliction's dart

 thus loved associates chiefs of elder art
 teachers of wisdom who could once beguile
 my tedious hours and lighten every toil
 i now resign you nor with fainting heart

 for pass a few short years or days or hours
 and happier seasons may their dawn unfold
 and all your sacred fellowship restore
 when freed from earth unlimited its powers
 mind shall with mind direct communion hold
 and kindred spirits meet to part no more




the wife

 the treasures of the deep are not so precious
 as are the concealed comforts of a man
 lock'd up in woman's love i scent the air
 of blessings when i came but near the house
 what a delicious breath marriage sends forth 
 the violet bed's no sweeter
 middleton

i have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women
sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune those disasters which
break down the spirit of a man and prostrate him in the dust seem to
call forth all the energies of the softer sex and give such intrepidity
and elevation to their character that at times it approaches to
sublimity nothing can be more touching than to behold a soft and
tender female who had been all weakness and dependence and alive to
every trivial roughness while threading the prosperous paths of life
suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and support of her
husband under misfortune and abiding with unshrinking firmness the
bitterest blasts of adversity

as the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak
and been lifted by it into sunshine will when the hardy plant is
rifted by the thunderbolt cling round it with its caressing tendrils
and bind up its shattered boughs so is it beautifully ordered by
providence that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man
in his happier hours should be his stay and solace when smitten with
sudden calamity winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature
tenderly supporting the drooping head and binding up the broken heart

i was once congratulating a friend who had around him a blooming
family knit together in the strongest affection i can wish you
no better lot said he with enthusiasm than to have a wife
and children if you are prosperous there they are to share your
prosperity if otherwise there they are to comfort you and indeed i
have observed that a married man falling into misfortune is more apt to
retrieve his situation in the world than a single one partly because
he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and
beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence but chiefly because
his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments and his
self-respect kept alive by finding that though all abroad is darkness
and humiliation yet there is still a little world of love at home of
which he is the monarch whereas a single man is apt to run to waste
and self-neglect to fancy himself lonely and abandoned and his heart
to fall to ruin like some deserted mansion for want of an inhabitant

these observations call to mind a little domestic story of which i was
once a witness my intimate friend leslie had married a beautiful and
accomplished girl who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable
life she had it is true no fortune but that of my friend was ample
and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in every elegant
pursuit and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that
spread a kind of witchery about the sex her life said he shall be
like a fairy tale

the very difference in their characters produced a harmonious
combination he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast she was
all life and gladness i have often noticed the mute rapture with which
he would gaze upon her in company of which her sprightly powers made
her the delight and how in the midst of applause her eye would still
turn to him as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance when
leaning on his arm her slender form contrasted finely with his tall
manly person the fond confiding air with which she looked up to
him seemed to call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing
tenderness as if he doated on his lovely burden from its very
helplessness never did a couple set forward on the flowery path of
early and well-suited marriage with a fairer prospect of felicity

it was the misfortune of my friend however to have embarked his
property in large speculations and he had not been married many months
when by a succession of sudden disasters it was swept from him and he
found himself reduced to almost penury for a time he kept his situation
to himself and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking
heart his life was but a protracted agony and what rendered it more
insupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence of
his wife for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the news
she saw however with the quick eyes of affection that all was not
well with him she marked his altered looks and stifled sighs and was
not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness she
tasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him back
to happiness but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul the
more he saw cause to love her the more torturing was the thought that
he was soon to make her wretched a little while thought he and the
smile will vanish from that cheek the song will die away from those
lips the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow and the
happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down
like mine by the cares and miseries of the world

at length he came to me one day and related his whole situation in a
tone of the deepest despair when i had heard him through i inquired
does your wife know all this at the question he burst into an agony
of tears for god's sake cried he if you have any pity on me don't
mention my wife it is the thought of her that drives me almost to
madness

and why not said i she must know it sooner or later you cannot
keep it long from her and the intelligence may break upon her in a more
startling manner than if imparted by yourself for the accents of those
we love soften the harshest tidings besides you are depriving
yourself of the comforts of her sympathy and not merely that but also
endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together an unreserved
community of thought and feeling she will soon perceive that something
is secretly preying upon your mind and true love will not brook
reserve it feels undervalued and outraged when even the sorrows of
those it loves are concealed from it

oh but my friend to think what a blow i am to give to all her future
prospects how i am to strike her very soul to the earth by telling
her that her husband is a beggar that she is to forego all the
elegancies of life all the pleasures of society to shrink with me into
indigence and obscurity to tell her that i have dragged her down
from the sphere in which she might have continued to move in constant
brightness the light of every eye the admiration of every heart how
can she bear poverty she has been brought up in all the refinements of
opulence how can she bear neglect she has been the idol of society
oh it will break her heart it will break her heart

i saw his grief was eloquent and i let it have its flow for sorrow
relieves itself by words when his paroxysm had subsided and he had
relapsed into moody silence i resumed the subject gently and urged
him to break his situation at once to his wife he shook his head
mournfully but positively

but how are you to keep it from her it is necessary she should
know it that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your
circumstances you must change your style of living nay observing a
pang to pass across his countenance don't let that afflict you i am
sure you have never placed your happiness in outward show you have yet
friends warm friends who will not think the worse of you for being
less splendidly lodged and surely it does not require a palace to be
happy with mary 

i could be happy with her cried he convulsively in a hovel i
could go down with her into poverty and the dust i could i could god
bless her god bless her cried he bursting into a transport of grief
and tenderness

and believe me my friend said i stepping up and grasping him
warmly by the hand believe me she can be the same with you ay more
it will be a source of pride and triumph to her it will call forth all
the latent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature for she will
rejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself there is in every true
woman's heart a spark of heavenly fire which lies dormant in the broad
daylight of prosperity but which kindles up and beams and blazes
in the dark hour of adversity no man knows what the wife of his bosom
is no man knows what a ministering angel she is until he has gone with
her through the fiery trials of this world

there was something in the earnestness of my manner and the figurative
style of my language that caught the excited imagination of leslie i
knew the auditor i had to deal with and following up the impression i
had made i finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad
heart to his wife

i must confess notwithstanding all i had said i felt some little
solicitude for the result who can calculate on the fortitude of one
whose life has been a round of pleasures her gay spirits might revolt
at the dark downward path of low humility suddenly pointed out before
her and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto
revelled besides ruin in fashionable life is accompanied by so many
galling mortifications to which in other ranks it is a stranger in
short i could not meet leslie the next morning without trepidation
he had made the disclosure

and how did she bear it

like an angel it seemed rather to be a relief to her mind for she
threw her arms around my neck and asked if this was all that had lately
made me unhappy but poor girl added he she cannot realize the
change we must undergo she has no idea of poverty but in the abstract
she has only read of it in poetry where it is allied to love she feels
as yet no privation she suffers no loss of accustomed conveniences nor
elegancies when we come practically to experience its sordid cares its
paltry wants its petty humiliations then will be the real trial

but said i now that you have got over the severest task that of
breaking it to her the sooner you let the world into the secret the
better the disclosure may be mortifying but then it is a single
misery and soon over whereas you otherwise suffer it in anticipation
every hour in the day it is not poverty so much as pretence that
harasses a ruined man the struggle between a proud mind and an empty
purse-the keeping up a hollow show that must soon come to an end have
the courage to appear poor and you disarm poverty of its sharpest
sting on this point i found leslie perfectly prepared he had no false
pride himself and as to his wife she was only anxious to conform to
their altered fortunes

some days afterwards he called upon me in the evening he had disposed
of his dwelling-house and taken a small cottage in the country a few
miles from town he had been busied all day in sending out furniture
the new establishment required few articles and those of the simplest
kind all the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold
excepting his wife's harp that he said was too closely associated
with the idea of herself it belonged to the little story of their loves
for some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he
had leaned over that instrument and listened to the melting tones of
her voice i could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry
in a doating husband

he was now going out to the cottage where his wife had been all
day superintending its arrangement my feelings had become strongly
interested in the progress of his family story and as it was a fine
evening i offered to accompany him

he was wearied with the fatigues of the day and as we walked out fell
into a fit of gloomy musing

poor mary at length broke with a heavy sigh from his lips

and what of her asked i has anything happened to her

what said he darting an impatient glance is it nothing to be
reduced to this paltry situation to be caged in a miserable cottage to
be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched
habitation

has she then repined at the change

repined she has been nothing but sweetness and good-humor indeed she
seems in better spirits than i have ever known her she has been to me
all love and tenderness and comfort

admirable girl exclaimed i you call yourself poor my friend
you never were so rich you never knew the boundless treasures of
excellence you possessed in that woman

oh but my friend if this first meeting at the cottage were over
i think i could then be comfortable but this is her first day of real
experience she has been introduced into a humble dwelling she has
been employed all day in arranging its miserable equipments she has
for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment she has
for the first time looked around her on a home destitute of every thing
elegant almost of every thing convenient and may now be sitting down
exhausted and spiritless brooding over a prospect of future poverty

there was a degree of probability in this picture that i could not
gainsay so we walked on in silence

after turning from the main road up a narrow lane so thickly shaded
with forest-trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion we came
in sight of the cottage it was humble enough in its appearance for the
most pastoral poet and yet it had a pleasing rural look a wild vine
had overrun one end with a profusion of foliage a few trees threw their
branches gracefully over it and i observed several pots of flowers
tastefully disposed about the door and on the grass-plot in front
a small wicket-gate opened upon a footpath that wound through some
shrubbery to the door just as we approached we heard the sound of
music leslie grasped my arm we paused and listened it was mary's
voice singing in a style of the most touching simplicity a little air
of which her husband was peculiarly fond

i felt leslie's hand tremble on my arm he stepped forward to hear more
distinctly his step made a noise on the gravel-walk a bright beautiful
face glanced out at the window and vanished a light footstep-was
heard and mary came tripping forth to meet us she was in a pretty
rural dress of white a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine
hair a fresh bloom was on her cheek her whole countenance beamed with
smiles i had never seen her look so lovely

my dear george cried she i am so glad you are come i have been
watching and watching for you and running down the lane and looking
out for you i've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind
the cottage and i've been gathering some of the most delicious
strawberries for i know you are fond of them and we have such
excellent cream and everything is so sweet and still here-oh said
she putting her arm within his and looking up brightly in his face
oh we shall be so happy

poor leslie was overcome he caught her to his bosom he folded his
arms round her he kissed her again and again he could not speak but
the tears gushed into his eyes and he has often assured me that
though the world has since gone prosperously with him and his life has
indeed been a happy one yet never has he experienced a moment of more
exquisite felicity




rip van winkle

a posthumous writing of diedrich knickerbocker

 by woden god of saxons
 from whence comes wensday that is wodensday
 truth is a thing that ever i will keep
 unto thylke day in which i creep into
 my sepulchre 
 cartwright

the following tale was found among the papers of the late diedrich
knickerbocker an old gentleman of new york who was very curious in the
dutch history of the province and the manners of the descendants from
its primitive settlers his historical researches however did not lie
so much among books as among men for the former are lamentably scanty
on his favorite topics whereas he found the old burghers and still
more their wives rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true
history whenever therefore he happened upon a genuine dutch family
snugly shut up in its low-roofed farm-house under a spreading sycamore
he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter and
studied it with the zeal of a bookworm

the result of all these researches was a history of the province during
the reign of the dutch governors which he published some years since
there have been various opinions as to the literary character of his
work and to tell the truth it is not a whit better than it should be
its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy which indeed was a little
questioned on its first appearance but has since been completely
established and it is now admitted into all historical collections as
a book of unquestionable authority

the old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work and
now that he is dead and gone it cannot do much harm to his memory to
say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier
labors he however was apt to ride his hobby his own way and though
it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his
neighbors and grieve the spirit of some friends for whom he felt
the truest deference and affection yet his errors and follies
are remembered more in sorrow than in anger and it begins to be
suspected that he never intended to injure or offend but however his
memory may be appreciated by critics it is still held dear among many
folks whose good opinion is well worth having particularly by certain
biscuit-bakers who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their
new-year cakes and have thus given him a chance for immortality
almost equal to the being stamped on a waterloo medal or a queen anne's
farthing


whoever has made a voyage up the hudson must remember the kaatskill
mountains they are a dismembered branch of the great appalachian
family and are seen away to the west of the river swelling up to a
noble height and lording it over the surrounding country every change
of season every change of weather indeed every hour of the day
produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains
and they are regarded by all the good wives far and near as perfect
barometers when the weather is fair and settled they are clothed in
blue and purple and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky
but sometimes when the rest of the landscape is cloudless they will
gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits which in the last
rays of the setting sun will glow and light up like a crown of glory

at the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may have descried the
light smoke curling up from a village whose shingle roofs gleam among
the trees just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the
fresh green of the nearer landscape it is a little village of great
antiquity having been founded by some of the dutch colonists in the
early times of the province just about the beginning of the government
of the good peter stuyvesant may he rest in peace and there were
some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years
built of small yellow bricks brought from holland having latticed
windows and gable fronts surmounted with weathercocks

in that same village and in one of these very houses which to tell
the precise truth was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten there lived
many years since while the country was yet a province of great britain
a simple good-natured fellow of the name of rip van winkle he was a
descendant of the van winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous
days of peter stuyvesant and accompanied him to the siege of fort
christina he inherited however but little of the martial character of
his ancestors i have observed that he was a simple good-natured man
he was moreover a kind neighbor and an obedient henpecked husband
indeed to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of
spirit which gained him such universal popularity for those men are apt
to be obsequious and conciliating abroad who are under the discipline
of shrews at home their tempers doubtless are rendered pliant
and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation and a
curtain-lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the
virtues of patience and long-suffering a termagant wife may therefore
in some respects be considered a tolerable blessing and if so rip van
winkle was thrice blessed

certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of
the village who as usual with the amiable sex took his part in all
family squabbles and never failed whenever they talked those matters
over in their evening gossipings to lay all the blame on dame van
winkle the children of the village too would shout with joy whenever
he approached he assisted at their sports made their playthings
taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles and told them long stories
of ghosts witches and indians whenever he went dodging about the
village he was surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts
clambering on his back and playing a thousand tricks on him with
impunity and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood

the great error in rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to
all kinds of profitable labor it could not be for want of assiduity
or perseverance for he would sit on a wet rock with a rod as long
and heavy as a tartar's lance and fish all day without a murmur even
though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble he would carry
a fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours together trudging through
woods and swamps and up hill and down dale to shoot a few squirrels
or wild pigeons he would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the
roughest toil and was a foremost man in all country frolics for husking
indian corn or building stone fences the women of the village too
used to employ him to run their errands and to do such little odd jobs
as their less obliging husbands would not do for them in a word rip
was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own but as to doing
family duty and keeping his farm in order he found it impossible

in fact he declared it was of no use to work on his farm it was the
most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country everything
about it went wrong in spite of him his fences were continually
falling to pieces his cow would either go astray or get among the
cabbages weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere
else the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some
out-door work to do so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled
away under his management acre by acre until there was little more
left than a mere patch of indian corn and potatoes yet it was the
worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood

his children too were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to
nobody his son rip an urchin begotten in his own likeness promised
to inherit the habits with the old clothes of his father he was
generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels equipped in
a pair of his father's cast-off galligaskins which he had much ado to
hold up with one hand as a fine lady does her train in bad weather

rip van winkle however was one of those happy mortals of foolish
well-oiled dispositions who take the world easy eat white bread or
brown whichever can be got with least thought or trouble and would
rather starve on a penny than work for a pound if left to himself he
would have whistled life away in perfect contentment but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness his carelessness
and the ruin he was bringing on his family morning noon and night
her tongue was incessantly going and every thing he said or did was
sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence rip had but one way
of replying to all lectures of the kind and that by frequent use had
grown into a habit he shrugged his shoulders shook his head cast
up his eyes but said nothing this however always provoked a fresh
volley from his wife so that he was fain to draw off his forces and
take to the outside of the house the only side which in truth belongs
to a henpecked husband

rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog wolf who was as much henpecked
as his master for dame van winkle regarded them as companions in
idleness and even looked upon wolf with an evil eye as the cause of
his master's going so often astray true it is in all points of spirit
befitting in honorable dog he was as courageous an animal as ever
scoured the woods but what courage can withstand the evil-doing and
all-besetting terrors of a woman's tongue the moment wolf entered the
house his crest fell his tail drooped to the ground or curled between
his legs he sneaked about with a gallows air casting many a sidelong
glance at dame van winkle and at the least flourish of a broomstick or
ladle he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation

times grew worse and worse with rip van winkle as years of matrimony
rolled on a tart temper never mellows with age and a sharp tongue
is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use for a long
while he used to console himself when driven from home by frequenting
a kind of perpetual club of the sages philosophers and other idle
personages of the village which held its sessions on a bench before a
small inn designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty george the
third here they used to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer's
day talking listlessly over village gossip or telling endless sleepy
stories about nothing but it would have been worth any statesman's
money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place
when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing
traveller how solemnly they would listen to the contents as drawled
out by derrick van bummel the school-master a dapper learned little
man who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the
dictionary and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some
months after they had taken place

the opinions of this junto were completely controlled by nicholas
vedder a patriarch of the village and landlord of the inn at the
door of which he took his seat from morning till night just moving
sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree so
that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as
by a sun-dial it is true he was rarely heard to speak but smoked his
pipe incessantly his adherents however for every great man has
his adherents perfectly understood him and knew how to gather his
opinions when any thing that was read or related displeased him he was
observed to smoke his pipe vehemently and to send forth frequent
and angry puffs but when pleased he would inhale the smoke slowly
and tranquilly and emit it in light and placid clouds and sometimes
taking the pipe from his mouth and letting the fragrant vapor
curl about his nose would gravely nod his head in token of perfect
approbation

from even this stronghold the unlucky rip was at length routed by his
termagant wife who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of
the assemblage and call the members all to nought nor was that august
personage nicholas vedder himself sacred from the daring tongue of
this terrible virago who charged him outright with encouraging her
husband in habits of idleness

poor rip was at last reduced almost to despair and his only
alternative to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his
wife was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods here
he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree and share
the contents of his wallet with wolf with whom he sympathized as a
fellow-sufferer in persecution poor wolf he would say thy mistress
leads thee a dog's life of it but never mind my lad whilst i live
thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee wolf would wag his
tail look wistfully in his master's face and if dogs can feel pity i
verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart

in a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day rip had
unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the kaatskill
mountains he was after his favorite sport of squirrel-shooting and the
still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun
panting and fatigued he threw himself late in the afternoon on a
green knoll covered with mountain herbage that crowned the brow of a
precipice from an opening between the trees he could overlook all the
lower country for many a mile of rich woodland he saw at a distance
the lordly hudson far far below him moving on its silent but majestic
course with the reflection of a purple cloud or the sail of a lagging
bark here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom and at last losing
itself in the blue highlands

on the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen wild
lonely and shagged the bottom filled with fragments from the impending
cliffs and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting
sun for some time rip lay musing on this scene evening was gradually
advancing the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over
the valleys he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the
village and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the
terrors of dame van winkle

as he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing
rip van winkle rip van winkle he looked around but could see
nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain he
thought his fancy must have deceived him and turned again to descend
when he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air rip van
winkle rip van winkle at the same time wolf bristled up his back
and giving a low growl skulked to his master's side looking fearfully
down into the glen rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over
him he looked anxiously in the same direction and perceived a strange
figure slowly toiling up the rocks and bending under the weight of
something he carried on his back he was surprised to see any human
being in this lonely and unfrequented place but supposing it to be some
one of the neighborhood in need of his assistance he hastened down to
yield it

on nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of
the stranger's appearance he was a short square-built old fellow with
thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard his dress was of the antique
dutch fashion a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist several pairs of
breeches the outer one of ample volume decorated with rows of buttons
down the sides and bunches at the knees he bore on his shoulders
a stout keg that seemed full of liquor and made signs for rip to
approach and assist him with the load though rather shy and distrustful
of this new acquaintance rip complied with his usual alacrity and
mutually relieving each other they clambered up a narrow gully
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent as they ascended rip
every now and then heard long rolling peals like distant thunder that
seemed to issue out of a deep ravine or rather cleft between lofty
rocks toward which their rugged path conducted he paused for an
instant but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient
thunder-showers which often take place in the mountain heights he
proceeded passing through the ravine they came to a hollow like a
small amphitheatre surrounded by perpendicular precipices over the
brinks of which impending trees shot their branches so that you only
caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud during
the whole time rip and his companion had labored on in silence for
though the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying
a keg of liquor up this wild mountain yet there was something strange
and incomprehensible about the unknown that inspired awe and checked
familiarity

on entering the amphitheatre new objects of wonder presented
themselves on a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking
personages playing at ninepins they were dressed in quaint outlandish
fashion some wore short doublets others jerkins with long knives in
their belts and most of them had enormous breeches of similar style
with that of the guide's their visages too were peculiar one had
a large head broad face and small piggish eyes the face of another
seemed to consist entirely of nose and was surmounted by a white
sugar-loaf hat set off with a little red cock's tail they all had
beards of various shapes and colors there was one who seemed to be
the commander he was a stout old gentleman with a weather-beaten
countenance he wore a laced doublet broad belt and hanger
high-crowned hat and feather red stockings and high-heeled shoes with
roses in them the whole group reminded rip of the figures in an old
flemish painting in the parlor of dominie van schaick the village
parson and which had been brought over from holland at the time of the
settlement

what seemed particularly odd to rip was that though these folks were
evidently amusing themselves yet they maintained the gravest faces the
most mysterious silence and were withal the most melancholy party of
pleasure he had ever witnessed nothing interrupted the stillness of
the scene but the noise of the balls which whenever they were rolled
echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder

as rip and his companion approached them they suddenly desisted from
their play and stared at him with such a fixed statue-like gaze and
such strange uncouth lack-lustre countenances that his heart turned
within him and his knees smote together his companion now emptied the
contents of the keg into large flagons and made signs to him to wait
upon the company he obeyed with fear and trembling they quaffed the
liquor in profound silence and then returned to their game

by degrees rip's awe and apprehension subsided he even ventured when
no eye was fixed upon him to taste the beverage which he found had much
of the flavor of excellent hollands he was naturally a thirsty soul
and was soon tempted to repeat the draught one taste provoked another
and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often that at length his
senses were overpowered his eyes swam in his head his head gradually
declined and he fell into a deep sleep

on waking he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first
seen the old man of the glen he rubbed his eyes it was a bright sunny
morning the birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes and
the eagle was wheeling aloft and breasting the pure mountain breeze
surely thought rip i have not slept here all night he recalled
the occurrences before he fell asleep the strange man with the keg
of liquor the mountain ravine the wild retreat among the rocks the
woe-begone party at ninepins the flagon oh that flagon that wicked
flagon thought rip what excuse shall i make to dame van winkle

he looked round for his gun but in place of the clean well-oiled
fowling-piece he found an old firelock lying by him the barrel
encrusted with rust the lock falling off and the stock worm-eaten he
now suspected that the grave roysterers of the mountains had put a trick
upon him and having dosed him with liquor had robbed him of his
gun wolf too had disappeared but he might have strayed away after a
squirrel or partridge he whistled after him and shouted his name but
all in vain the echoes repeated his whistle and shout but no dog was
to be seen

he determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol and if
he met with any of the party to demand his dog and gun as he rose to
walk he found himself stiff in the joints and wanting in his usual
activity these mountain beds do not agree with me thought rip and
if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism i shall
have a blessed time with dame van winkle with some difficulty he got
down into the glen he found the gully up which he and his companion
had ascended the preceding evening but to his astonishment a mountain
stream was now foaming down it leaping from rock to rock and filling
the glen with babbling murmurs he however made shift to scramble
up its sides working his toilsome way through thickets of birch
sassafras and witch-hazel and sometimes tripped up or entangled by
the wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to
tree and spread a kind of network in his path

at length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs
to the amphitheatre but no traces of such opening remained the rocks
presented a high impenetrable wall over which the torrent came tumbling
in a sheet of feathery foam and fell into a broad deep basin black
from the shadows of the surrounding forest here then poor rip was
brought to a stand he again called and whistled after his dog he was
only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows sporting high
in the air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice and who
secure in their elevation seemed to look down and scoff at the poor
man's perplexities what was to be done the morning was passing away
and rip felt famished for want of his breakfast he grieved to give up
his dog and gun he dreaded to meet his wife but it would not do to
starve among the mountains he shook his head shouldered the rusty
firelock and with a heart full of trouble and anxiety turned his
steps homeward

as he approached the village he met a number of people but none
whom he new which somewhat surprised him for he had thought himself
acquainted with every one in the country round their dress too was
of a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed they all
stared at him with equal marks of surprise and whenever they cast eyes
upon him invariably stroked their chins the constant recurrence of
this gesture induced rip involuntarily to do the same when to his
astonishment he found his beard had grown a foot long

he had now entered the skirts of the village a troop of strange
children ran at his heels hooting after him and pointing at his
gray beard the dogs too not one of which he recognized for an old
acquaintance barked at him as he passed the very village was altered
it was larger and more populous there were rows of houses which he
had never seen before and those which had been his familiar haunts had
disappeared strange names were over the doors strange faces at the
windows everything was strange his mind now misgave him he began
to doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched
surely this was his native village which he had left but a day before
there stood the kaatskill mountains there ran the silver hudson at
a distance there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always
been rip was sorely perplexed that flagon last night thought he
has addled my poor head sadly

it was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house
which he approached with silent awe expecting every moment to hear the
shrill voice of dame van winkle he found the house gone to decay the
roof had fallen in the windows shattered and the doors off the hinges
a half-starved dog that looked like wolf was skulking about it rip
called him by name but the cur snarled showed his teeth and passed
on this was an unkind cut indeed my very dog sighed poor rip has
forgotten me

he entered the house which to tell the truth dame van winkle had
always kept in neat order it was empty forlorn and apparently
abandoned this desolateness overcame all his connubial fears he called
loudly for his wife and children the lonely chambers rang for a moment
with his voice and then all again was silence

he now hurried forth and hastened to his old resort the village
inn but it too was gone a large rickety wooden building stood in its
place with great gaping windows some of them broken and mended with
old hats and petticoats and over the door was painted the union
hotel by jonathan doolittle instead of the great tree that used to
shelter the quiet little dutch inn of yore there now was reared a tall
naked pole with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap
and from it was fluttering a flag on which was a singular assemblage
of stars and stripes all this was strange and incomprehensible he
recognized on the sign however the ruby face of king george
under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe but even this was
singularly metamorphosed the red coat was changed for one of blue and
buff a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre the head
was decorated with a cocked hat and underneath was painted in large
characters general washington

there was as usual a crowd of folk about the door but none that rip
recollected the very character of the people seemed changed there was
a busy bustling disputatious tone about it instead of the accustomed
phlegm and drowsy tranquillity he looked in vain for the sage nicholas
vedder with his broad face double chin and fair long pipe uttering
clouds of tobacco-smoke instead of idle speeches or van bummel the
schoolmaster doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper in
place of these a lean bilious-looking fellow with his pockets full
of handbills was haranguing vehemently about rights of
citizens-elections members of congress liberty bunker's hill heroes
of seventy-six-and other words which were a perfect babylonish jargon
to the bewildered van winkle

the appearance of rip with his long grizzled beard his rusty
fowling-piece his uncouth dress and the army of women and children at
his heels soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians they
crowded round him eying him from head to foot with great curiosity
the orator bustled up to him and drawing him partly aside inquired
on which side he voted rip stared in vacant stupidity another short
but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm and rising on tiptoe
inquired in his ear whether he was federal or democrat rip
was equally at a loss to comprehend the question when a knowing
self-important old gentleman in a sharp cocked hat made his way
through the crowd putting them to the right and left with his elbows as
he passed and planting himself before van winkle with one arm akimbo
the other resting on his cane his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating
as it were into his very soul demanded in an austere tone what
brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his
heels and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village

alas gentlemen cried rip somewhat dismayed i am a poor quiet
man a native of the place and a loyal subject of the king god bless
him

here a general shout burst from the bystanders-a tory a tory a spy
a refugee hustle him away with him it was with great difficulty
that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order and having
assumed a tenfold austerity of brow demanded again of the unknown
culprit what he came there for and whom he was seeking the poor
man humbly assured him that he meant no harm but merely came there in
search of some of his neighbors who used to keep about the tavern

well who are they name them

rip bethought himself a moment and inquired where's nicholas vedder

there was a silence for a little while when an old man replied in a
thin piping voice nicholas vedder why he is dead and gone these
eighteen years there was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used
to tell all about him but that's rotten and gone too

where's brom dutcher

oh he went off to the army in the beginning of the war some say he
was killed at the storming of stony-point others say he was drowned in
a squall at the foot of antony's nose i don't know he never came back
again

where's van bummel the schoolmaster

he went off to the wars too was a great militia general and is now
in congress

rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home
and friends and finding himself thus alone in the world every answer
puzzled him too by treating of such enormous lapses of time and of
matters which he could not understand war congress-stony-point he
had no courage to ask after any more friends but cried out in despair
does nobody here know rip van winkle

oh rip van winkle exclaimed two or three oh to be sure that's
rip van winkle yonder leaning against the tree

rip looked and beheld a precise counterpart of himself as he went up
the mountain apparently as lazy and certainly as ragged the poor
fellow was now completely confounded he doubted his own identity and
whether he was himself or another man in the midst of his bewilderment
the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was and what was his name

god knows exclaimed he at his wit's end i'm not myself i'm
somebody else that's me yonder-no that's somebody else got into my
shoes i was myself last night but i fell asleep on the mountain and
they've changed my gun and everything's changed and i'm changed and i
can't tell what's my name or who i am

the by-standers began now to look at each other nod wink
significantly and tap their fingers against their foreheads there was
a whisper also about securing the gun and keeping the old fellow from
doing mischief at the very suggestion of which the self-important man
with the cocked hat retired with some precipitation at this critical
moment a fresh comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep
at the gray-bearded man she had a chubby child in her arms which
frightened at his looks began to cry hush rip cried she hush
you little fool the old man won't hurt you the name of the child
the air of the mother the tone of her voice all awakened a train of
recollections in his mind

what is your name my good woman asked he

judith cardenier

and your father's name

ah poor man rip van winkle was his name but it's twenty years
since he went away from home with his gun and never has been heard of
since his dog came home without him but whether he shot himself
or was carried away by the indians nobody can tell i was then but a
little girl

rip had but one more question to ask but he put it with a faltering
voice

where's your mother

oh she too had died but a short time since she broke a blood-vessel in
a fit of passion at a new-england pedler

there was a drop of comfort at least in this intelligence the honest
man could contain himself no longer he caught his daughter and her
child in his arms i am your father cried he-young rip van winkle
once-old rip van winkle now does nobody know poor rip van winkle

all stood amazed until an old woman tottering out from among the
crowd put her hand to her brow and peering under it in his face for
a moment exclaimed sure enough it is rip van winkle it is himself
welcome home again old neighbor why where have you been these twenty
long years

rip's story was soon told for the whole twenty years had been to him
but as one night the neighbors stared when they heard it some were
seen to wink at each other and put their tongues in their cheeks and
the self-important man in the cocked hat who when the alarm was over
had returned to the field screwed down the corners of his mouth and
shook his head upon which there was a general shaking of the head
throughout the assemblage

it was determined however to take the opinion of old peter vanderdonk
who was seen slowly advancing up the road he was a descendant of the
historian of that name who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the
province peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village and well
versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood
he recollected rip at once and corroborated his story in the most
satisfactory manner he assured the company that it was a fact handed
down from his ancestor the historian that the kaatskill mountains had
always been haunted by strange beings that it was affirmed that the
great hendrick hudson the first discoverer of the river and country
kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years with his crew of the
half-moon being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his
enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city
called by his name that his father had once seen them in their old
dutch dresses playing at ninepins in the hollow of the mountain and
that he himself had heard one summer afternoon the sound of their
balls like distant peals of thunder

to make a long story short the company broke up and returned to the
more important concerns of the election rip's daughter took him home to
live with her she had a snug well-furnished house and a stout cheery
farmer for a husband whom rip recollected for one of the urchins that
used to climb upon his back as to rip's son and heir who was the ditto
of himself seen leaning against the tree he was employed to work on
the farm but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to any thing
else but his business

rip now resumed his old walks and habits he soon found many of his
former cronies though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of
time and preferred making friends among the rising generation with
whom he soon grew into great favor

having nothing to do at home and being arrived at that happy age when a
man can be idle with impunity he took his place once more on the bench
at the inn door and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the
village and a chronicle of the old times before the war it was some
time before he could get into the regular track of gossip or could be
made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his
torpor how that there had been a revolutionary war that the country
had thrown off the yoke of old england and that instead of being a
subject to his majesty george the third he was now a free citizen
of the united states rip in fact was no politician the changes of
states and empires made but little impression on him but there was
one species of despotism under which he had long groaned and that
was petticoat government happily that was at an end he had got his
neck out of the yoke of matrimony and could go in and out whenever he
pleased without dreading the tyranny of dame van winkle whenever her
name was mentioned however he shook his head shrugged his shoulders
and cast up his eyes which might pass either for an expression of
resignation to his fate or joy at his deliverance

he used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at mr
doolittle's hotel he was observed at first to vary on some points
every time he told it which was doubtless owing to his having so
recently awaked it at last settled down precisely to the tale i have
related and not a man woman or child in the neighborhood but knew it
by heart some always pretended to doubt the reality of it and insisted
that rip had been out of his head and that this was one point on which
he always remained flighty the old dutch inhabitants however almost
universally gave it full credit even to this day they never hear a
thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the kaatskill but they say
hendrick hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins and it is
a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood when life
hangs heavy on their hands that they might have a quieting draught out
of rip van winkle's flagon

note

the foregoing tale one would suspect had been suggested to mr
knickerbocker by a little german superstition about the emperor
frederick der rothbart and the kypphauser mountain the subjoined note
however which had appended to the tale shows that it is an absolute
fact narrated with his usual fidelity

the story of rip van winkle may seem incredible to many but
nevertheless i give it my full belief for i know the vicinity of our
old dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and
appearances indeed i have heard many stranger stories than this in
the villages along the hudson all of which were too well authenticated
to admit of a doubt i have even talked with rip van winkle myself
who when last i saw him was a very venerable old man and so
perfectly rational and consistent on every other point that i think no
conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain nay i
have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice
and signed with cross in the justice's own handwriting the story
therefore is beyond the possibility of doubt

postscript

the following are travelling notes from a memorandum-book of mr
knickerbocker

the kaatsberg or catskill mountains have always been a region full of
fable the indians considered them the abode of spirits who influenced
the weather spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape and
sending good or bad hunting seasons they were ruled by an old squaw
spirit said to be their mother she dwelt on the highest peak of the
catskills and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut
them at the proper hour she hung up the new moons in the skies and
cut up the old ones into stars in times of drought if properly
propitiated she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and
morning dew and send them off from the crest of the mountain flake
after flake like flakes of carded cotton to float in the air until
dissolved by the heat of the sun they would fall in gentle showers
causing the grass to spring the fruits to ripen and the corn to grow
an inch an hour if displeased however she would brew up clouds black
as ink sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the
midst of its web and when these clouds broke woe betide the valleys

in old times say the indian traditions there was a kind of manitou or
spirit who kept about the wildest recesses of the catskill mountains
and took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kind of evils and
vexations upon the red men sometimes he would assume the form of a
bear a panther or a deer lead the bewildered hunter a weary chase
through tangled forests and among ragged rocks and then spring off with
a loud ho ho leaving him aghast on the brink of a beetling precipice
or raging torrent

the favorite abode of this manitou is still shown it is a rock or cliff
on the loneliest port of the mountains and from the flowering vines
which clamber about it and the wild flowers which abound in its
neighborhood is known by the name of the garden rock near the foot of
it is a small lake the haunt of the solitary bittern with water-snakes
basking in the sun on the leaves of the pond-lilies which lie on the
surface this place was held in great awe by the indians insomuch that
the boldest hunter would not pursue his game within its precincts once
upon a time however a hunter who had lost his way penetrated to the
garden rock where he beheld a number of gourds placed in the crotches
of trees one of these he seized and made off with it but in the hurry
of his retreat he let it fall among the rocks when a great stream
gushed forth which washed him away and swept him down precipices where
he was dished to pieces and the stream made its way to the hudson and
continues to flow to the present day being the identical stream known
by the name of the kaaterskill




english writers on america

methinks i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousting herself
like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks
methinks i see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling
her endazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam milton on the liberty of
the press

it is with feelings of deep regret that i observe the literary animosity
daily growing up between england and america great curiosity has been
awakened of late with respect to the united states and the london press
has teemed with volumes of travels through the republic but they seem
intended to diffuse error rather than knowledge and so successful have
they been that notwithstanding the constant intercourse between
the nations there is no people concerning whom the great mass of the
british public have less pure information or entertain more numerous
prejudices

english travellers are the best and the worst in the world where no
motives of pride or interest intervene none can equal them for
profound and philosophical views of society or faithful and graphical
description of external objects but when either the interest or
reputation of their own country comes in collision with that of another
they go to the opposite extreme and forget their usual probity and
candor in the indulgence of splenetic remark and an illiberal spirit
of ridicule

hence their travels are more honest and accurate the more remote the
country described i would place implicit confidence in an englishman's
description of the regions beyond the cataracts of the nile of unknown
islands in the yellow sea of the interior of india or of any other
tract which other travellers might be apt to picture out with the
illusions of their fancies but i would cautiously receive his account
of his immediate neighbors and of those nations with which he is in
habits of most frequent intercourse however i might be disposed to
trust his probity i dare not trust his prejudices

it has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the
worst kind of english travellers while men of philosophical spirit and
cultivated minds have been sent from england to ransack the poles to
penetrate the deserts and to study the manners and customs of barbarous
nations with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or
pleasure it has been left to the broken-down tradesman the scheming
adventurer the wandering mechanic the manchester and birmingham agent
to be her oracles respecting america from such sources she is content
to receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of
moral and physical development a country in which one of the greatest
political experiments in the history of the world is now performing and
which presents the most profound and momentous studies to the statesman
and the philosopher

that such men should give prejudicial accounts of america is not a
matter of surprise the themes it offers for contemplation are too vast
and elevated for their capacities the national character is yet in a
state of fermentation it may have its frothiness and sediment but
its ingredients are sound and wholesome it has already given proofs of
powerful and generous qualities and the whole promises to settle
down into something substantially excellent but the causes which are
operating to strengthen and ennoble it and its daily indications of
admirable properties are all lost upon these purblind observers who
are only affected by the little asperities incident to its present
situation they are capable of judging only of the surface of things
of those matters which come in contact with their private interests and
personal gratifications they miss some of the snug conveniences
and petty comforts which belong to an old highly-finished and
over-populous state of society where the ranks of useful labor are
crowded and many earn a painful and servile subsistence by studying
the very caprices of appetite and self-indulgence these minor comforts
however are all-important in the estimation of narrow minds which
either do not perceive or will not acknowledge that they are more than
counterbalanced among us by great and generally diffused blessings

they may perhaps have been disappointed in some unreasonable
expectation of sudden gain they may have pictured america to themselves
an el dorado where gold and silver abounded and the natives were
lacking in sagacity and where they were to become strangely and
suddenly rich in some unforeseen but easy manner the same weakness
of mind that indulges absurd expectations produces petulance in
disappointment such persons become embittered against the country on
finding that there as everywhere else a man must sow before he can
reap must win wealth by industry and talent and must contend with the
common difficulties of nature and the shrewdness of an intelligent and
enterprising people

perhaps through mistaken or ill-directed hospitality or from the
prompt disposition to cheer and countenance the stranger prevalent
among my countrymen they may have been treated with unwonted respect
in america and having been accustomed all their lives to consider
themselves below the surface of good society and brought up in a
servile feeling of inferiority they become arrogant on the common
boon of civility they attribute to the lowliness of others their
own elevation and underrate a society where there are no artificial
distinctions and where by any chance such individuals as themselves
can rise to consequence

one would suppose however that information coming from such sources
on a subject where the truth is so desirable would be received with
caution by the censors of the press that the motives of these men
their veracity their opportunities of inquiry and observation and
their capacities for judging correctly would be rigorously scrutinized
before their evidence was admitted in such sweeping extent against a
kindred nation the very reverse however is the case and it furnishes
a striking instance of human inconsistency nothing can surpass the
vigilance with which english critics will examine the credibility of
the traveller who publishes an account of some distant and comparatively
unimportant country how warily will they compare the measurements of a
pyramid or the description of a ruin and how sternly will they censure
any inaccuracy in these contributions of merely curious knowledge while
they will receive with eagerness and unhesitating faith the gross
misrepresentations of coarse and obscure writers concerning a country
with which their own is placed in the most important and delicate
relations nay they will even make these apocryphal volumes text-books
on which to enlarge with a zeal and an ability worthy of a more
generous cause

i shall not however dwell on this irksome and hackneyed topic nor
should i have adverted to it but for the undue interest apparently
taken in it by my countrymen and certain injurious effects which i
apprehend it might produce upon the national feeling we attach too much
consequence to these attacks they cannot do us any essential injury
the tissue of misrepresentations attempted to be woven round us are
like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant our country
continually outgrows them one falsehood after another falls off of
itself we have but to live on and every day we live a whole volume of
refutation

all the writers of england united if we could for a moment suppose
their great minds stooping to so unworthy a combination could not
conceal our rapidly growing importance and matchless prosperity they
could not conceal that these are owing not merely to physical and
local but also to moral causes to the political liberty the general
diffusion of knowledge the prevalence of sound moral and religious
principles which give force and sustained energy to the character of
a people and which in fact have been the acknowledged and wonderful
supporters of their own national power and glory

but why are we so exquisitely alive to the aspersions of england why
do we suffer ourselves to be so affected by the contumely she has
endeavored to cast upon us it is not in the opinion of england alone
that honor lives and reputation has its being the world at large is
the arbiter of a nation's fame with its thousand eyes it witnesses a
nation's deeds and from their collective testimony is national glory or
national disgrace established

for ourselves therefore it is comparatively of but little importance
whether england does us justice or not it is perhaps of far more
importance to herself she is instilling anger and resentment into the
bosom of a youthful nation to grow with its growth and strengthen
with its strength if in america as some of her writers are laboring
to convince her she is hereafter to find an invidious rival and a
gigantic foe she may thank those very writers for having provoked
rivalship and irritated hostility every one knows the all-pervading
influence of literature at the present day and how much the opinions
and passions of mankind are under its control the mere contests of the
sword are temporary their wounds are but in the flesh and it is the
pride of the generous to forgive and forget them but the slanders of
the pen pierce to the heart they rankle longest in the noblest spirits
they dwell ever present in the mind and render it morbidly sensitive
to the most trifling collision it is but seldom that any one overt act
produces hostilities between two nations there exists most commonly a
previous jealousy and ill-will a predisposition to take offence trace
these to their cause and how often will they be found to originate in
the mischievous effusions of mercenary writers who secure in their
closets and for ignominious bread concoct and circulate the venom that
is to inflame the generous and the brave

i am not laying too much stress upon this point for it applies most
emphatically to our particular case over no nation does the press
hold a more absolute control than over the people of america for the
universal education of the poorest classes makes every individual a
reader there is nothing published in england on the subject of our
country that does not circulate through every part of it there is not
a calumny dropt from an english pen nor an unworthy sarcasm uttered by
an english statesman that does not go to blight good-will and add to
the mass of latent resentment possessing then as england does
the fountain-head whence the literature of the language flows how
completely is it in her power and how truly is it her duty to make it
the medium of amiable and magnanimous feeling a stream where the two
nations might meet together and drink in peace and kindness should she
however persist in turning it to waters of bitterness the time may
come when she may repent her folly the present friendship of america
may be of but little moment to her but the future destinies of that
country do not admit of a doubt over those of england there lower
some shadows of uncertainty should then a day of gloom arrive should
those reverses overtake her from which the proudest empires have
not been exempt she may look back with regret at her infatuation in
repulsing from her side a nation she might have grappled to her bosom
and thus destroying her only chance for real friendship beyond the
boundaries of her own dominions

there is a general impression in england that the people of the united
states are inimical to the parent country it is one of the errors
which have been diligently propagated by designing writers there is
doubtless considerable political hostility and a general soreness at
the illiberality of the english press but collectively speaking the
prepossessions of the people are strongly in favor of england indeed
at one time they amounted in many parts of the union to an absurd
degree of bigotry the bare name of englishman was a passport to
the confidence and hospitality of every family and too often gave a
transient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful throughout the
country there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea
of england we looked to it with a hallowed feeling of tenderness and
veneration as the land of our forefathers the august repository of the
monuments and antiquities of our race the birthplace and mausoleum of
the sages and heroes of our paternal history after our own country
there was none in whose glory we more delighted none whose good opinion
we were more anxious to possess none toward which our hearts yearned
with such throbbings of warm consanguinity even during the late war
whenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring
forth it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show
that in the midst of hostilities they still kept alive the sparks of
future friendship

is all this to be at an end is this golden band of kindred sympathies
so rare between nations to be broken forever perhaps it is for the
best it may dispel an allusion which might have kept us in mental
vassalage which might have interfered occasionally with our true
interests and prevented the growth of proper national pride but it
is hard to give up the kindred tie and there are feelings dearer than
interest closer to the heart than pride that will still make us cast
back a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from the paternal
roof and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the
affections of the child

short-sighted and injudicious however as the conduct or england may be
in this system of aspersion recrimination on our part would be equally
ill-judged i speak not of a prompt and spirited vindication of our
country or the keenest castigation of her slanderers but i allude to
a disposition to retaliate in kind to retort sarcasm and inspire
prejudice which seems to be spreading widely among our writers let us
guard particularly against such a temper for it would double the evil
instead of redressing the wrong nothing is so easy and inviting as
the retort of abuse and sarcasm but it is a paltry and an unprofitable
contest it is the alternative of a morbid mind fretted into petulance
rather than warmed into indignation if england is willing to permit the
mean jealousies of trade or the rancorous animosities of politics to
deprave the integrity of her press and poison the fountain of public
opinion let us beware of her example she may deem it her interest
to diffuse error and engender antipathy for the purpose of checking
emigration we have no purpose of the kind to serve neither have we
any spirit of national jealousy to gratify for as yet in all our
rivalships with england we are the rising and the gaining party
there can be no end to answer therefore but the gratification of
resentment a mere spirit of retaliation and even that is impotent our
retorts are never republished in england they fall short therefore
of their aim but they foster a querulous and peevish temper among
our writers they sour the sweet flow of our early literature and
sow thorns and brambles among its blossoms what is still worse they
circulate through our own country and as far as they have effect
excite virulent national prejudices this last is the evil most
especially to be deprecated governed as we are entirely by public
opinion the utmost care should be taken to preserve the purity of
the public mind knowledge is power and truth is knowledge whoever
therefore knowingly propagates a prejudice wilfully saps the
foundation of his country's strength

the members of a republic above all other men should be candid and
dispassionate they are individually portions of the sovereign mind
and sovereign will and should be enabled to come to all questions of
national concern with calm and unbiassed judgments from the peculiar
nature of our relations with england we must have more frequent
questions of a difficult and delicate character with her than with
any other nation questions that affect the most acute and excitable
feelings and as in the adjustment of these our national measures
must ultimately be determined by popular sentiment we cannot be
too anxiously attentive to purify it from all latent passion or
prepossession

opening too as we do an asylum for strangers every portion of the
earth we should receive all with impartiality it should be our pride
to exhibit an example of one nation at least destitute of national
antipathies and exercising not merely the overt acts of hospitality
but those more rare and noble courtesies which spring from liberality of
opinion

what have we to do with national prejudices they are the inveterate
diseases of old countries contracted in rude and ignorant ages when
nations knew but little of each other and looked beyond their own
boundaries with distrust and hostility we on the contrary have sprung
into national existence in an enlightened and philosophic age when the
different parts of the habitable world and the various branches of the
human family have been indefatigably studied and made known to each
other and we forego the advantages of our birth if we do not shake off
the national prejudices as we would the local superstitions of the old
world

but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far
as to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and
amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an
imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree
from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of
our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous
to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activity their
freedom of opinion their habits of thinking on those subjects which
concern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private
life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all
intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people
that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however
the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be
something solid in the basis admirable in the materials and stable in
the structure of an edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the
tempests of the world

let it be the pride of our writers therefore discarding all feelings
of irritation and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of british
authors to speak of the english nation without prejudice and with
determined candor while they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with
which some of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing english
merely because it is english let them frankly point out what is
really worthy of approbation we may thus place england before us as
a perpetual volume of reference wherein are recorded sound deductions
from ages of experience and while we avoid the errors and absurdities
which may have crept into the page we may draw thence golden maxims of
practical wisdom wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national
character




rural life in england

 oh friendly to the best pursuits of man
 friendly to thought to virtue and to peace
 domestic life in rural pleasures past
 cowper

the stranger who would form a correct opinion of the english character
must not confine his observations to the metropolis he must go forth
into the country he must sojourn in villages and hamlets he must visit
castles villas farm-houses cottages he must wander through parks
and gardens along hedges and green lanes he must loiter about country
churches attend wakes and fairs and other rural festivals and cope
with the people in all their conditions and all their habits and
humors

in some countries the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of
the nation they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent
society and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish
peasantry in england on the contrary the metropolis is a mere
gathering-place or general rendezvous of the polite classes where
they devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gayety and
dissipation and having indulged this kind of carnival return again to
the apparently more congenial habits of rural life the various orders
of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom
and the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different
ranks

the english in fact are strongly gifted with the rural feeling they
possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature and a keen relish
for the pleasures and employments of the country this passion seems
inherent in them even the inhabitants of cities born and brought up
among brick walls and bustling streets enter with facility into rural
habits and evince a tact for rural occupation the merchant has his
snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis where he often displays
as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower-garden and the
maturing of his fruits as he does in the conduct of his business
and the success of a commercial enterprise even those less fortunate
individuals who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and
traffic contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green
aspect of nature in the most dark and dingy quarters of the city the
drawing-room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers every spot
capable of vegetation has its grass-plot and flower-bed and every
square its mimic park laid out with picturesque taste and gleaming
with refreshing verdure

those who see the englishman only in town are apt to form an
unfavorable opinion of his social character he is either absorbed in
business or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time
thought and feeling in this huge metropolis he has therefore too
commonly a look of hurry and abstraction wherever he happens to be he
is on the point of going somewhere else at the moment he is talking
on one subject his mind is wandering to another and while paying a
friendly visit he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to
pay the other visits allotted to the morning an immense metropolis
like london is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting
in their casual and transient meetings they can but deal briefly in
commonplaces they present but the cold superfices of character its
rich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow

it is in the country that the englishman gives scope to his natural
feelings he breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative
civilities of town throws off his habits of shy reserve and becomes
joyous and free-hearted he manages to collect round him all the
conveniences and elegancies of polite life and to banish its
restraints his country-seat abounds with every requisite either for
studious retirement tasteful gratification or rural exercise books
paintings music horses dogs and sporting implements of all kinds
are at hand he puts no constraint either upon his guests or himself
but in the true spirit of hospitality provides the means of enjoyment
and leaves every one to partake according to his inclination

the taste of the english in the cultivation of land and in what is
called landscape gardening is unrivalled they have studied nature
intently and discovered an exquisite sense of her beautiful forms and
harmonious combinations those charms which in other countries she
lavishes in wild solitudes are here assembled round the haunts of
domestic life they seem to have caught her coy and furtive graces and
spread them like witchery about their rural abodes

nothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of english park
scenery vast lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green with here
and there clumps of gigantic trees heaping up rich piles of foliage
the solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades with the deer trooping in
silent herds across them the hare bounding away to the covert or the
pheasant suddenly bursting upon the wing the brook taught to wind in
natural meanderings or expand into a glassy lake the sequestered pool
reflecting the quivering trees with the yellow leaf sleeping on its
bosom and the trout roaming fearlessly about its limpid waters while
some rustic temple or sylvan statue grown green and dank with age
gives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion

these are but a few of the features of park scenery but what most
delights me is the creative talent with which the english decorate the
unostentatious abodes of middle life the rudest habitation the most
unpromising and scanty portion of land in the hands of an englishman of
taste becomes a little paradise with a nicely discriminating eye
he seizes at once upon its capabilities and pictures in his mind the
future landscape the sterile spot grows into loveliness under his hand
and yet the operations of art which produce the effect are scarcely to
be perceived the cherishing and training of some trees the cautious
pruning of others the nice distribution of flowers and plants of tender
and graceful foliage the introduction of a green slope of velvet turf
the partial opening to a peep of blue distance or silver gleam of
water-all these are managed with a delicate tact a pervading yet quiet
assiduity like the magic touchings with which a painter finishes up a
favorite picture

the residence of people of fortune and refinement in the country has
diffused a degree of taste and elegance in rural economy that descends
to the lowest class the very laborer with his thatched cottage and
narrow slip of ground attends to their embellishment the trim hedge
the grass-plot before the door the little flower-bed bordered with snug
box the woodbine trained up against the wall and hanging its blossoms
about the lattice the pot of flowers in the window the holly
providently planted about the house to cheat winter of its dreariness
and to throw in a semblance of green summer to cheer the fireside all
these bespeak the influence of taste flowing down from high sources
and pervading the lowest levels of the public mind if ever love as
poets sing delights to visit a cottage it must be the cottage of an
english peasant

the fondness for rural life among the higher classes of the english has
had a great and salutary effect upon the national character i do not
know a finer race of men than the english gentlemen instead of the
softness and effeminacy which characterize the men of rank in most
countries they exhibit a union of elegance and strength a robustness
of frame and freshness of complexion which i am inclined to attribute
to their living so much in the open air and pursuing so eagerly the
invigorating recreations of the country the hardy exercises produce
also a healthful tone of mind and spirits and a manliness and
simplicity of manners which even the follies and dissipations of the
town cannot easily pervert and can never entirely destroy in the
country too the different orders of society seem to approach more
freely to be more disposed to blend and operate favorably upon each
other the distinctions between them do not appear to be so marked
and impassable as in the cities the manner in which property has been
distributed into small estates and farms has established a regular
gradation from the noblemen through the classes of gentry small landed
proprietors and substantial farmers down to the laboring peasantry
and while it has thus banded the extremes of society together has
infused into each intermediate rank a spirit of independence this it
must be confessed is not so universally the case at present as it was
formerly the larger estates having in late years of distress absorbed
the smaller and in some parts of the country almost annihilated the
sturdy race of small farmers these however i believe are but casual
breaks in the general system i have mentioned

in rural occupation there is nothing mean and debasing it leads a man
forth among scenes of natural grandeur and beauty it leaves him to the
workings of his own mind operated upon by the purest and most elevating
of external influences such a man may be simple and rough but he
cannot be vulgar the man of refinement therefore finds nothing
revolting in an intercourse with the lower orders in rural life as he
does when he casually mingles with the lower orders of cities he lays
aside his distance and reserve and is glad to waive the distinctions of
rank and to enter into the honest heartfelt enjoyments of common life
indeed the very amusements of the country bring men more and more
together and the sound hound and horn blend all feelings into harmony
i believe this is one great reason why the nobility and gentry are more
popular among the inferior orders in england than they are in any other
country and why the latter have endured so many excessive pressures and
extremities without repining more generally at the unequal distribution
of fortune and privilege

to this mingling of cultivated and rustic society may also be attributed
the rural feeling that runs through british literature the frequent
use of illustrations from rural life those incomparable descriptions of
nature that abound in the british poets that have continued down from
the flower and the leaf of chaucer and have brought into our closets
all the freshness and fragrance of the dewy landscape the pastoral
writers of other countries appear as if they had paid nature an
occasional visit and become acquainted with her general charms but the
british poets have lived and revelled with her they have wooed her in
her most secret haunts they have watched her minutest caprices a
spray could not tremble in the breeze a leaf could not rustle to the
ground a diamond drop could not patter in the stream a fragrance could
not exhale from the humble violet nor a daisy unfold its crimson
tints to the morning but it has been noticed by these impassioned and
delicate observers and wrought up into some beautiful morality

the effect of this devotion of elegant minds to rural occupations has
been wonderful on the face of the country a great part of the island
is rather level and would be monotonous were it not for the charms
of culture but it is studded and gemmed as it were with castles and
palaces and embroidered with parks and gardens it does not abound in
grand and sublime prospects but rather in little home scenes of rural
repose and sheltered quiet every antique farm-house and moss-grown
cottage is a picture and as the roads are continually winding and
the view is shut in by groves and hedges the eye is delighted by a
continual succession of small landscapes of captivating loveliness

the great charm however of english scenery is the moral feeling that
seems to pervade it it is associated in the mind with ideas of order
of quiet of sober well-established principles of hoary usage and
reverend custom every thing seems to be the growth of ages of regular
and peaceful existence the old church of remote architecture with its
low massive portal its gothic tower its windows rich with tracery
and painted glass in scrupulous preservation its stately monuments of
warriors and worthies of the olden time ancestors of the present lords
of the soil its tombstones recording successive generations of sturdy
yeomanry whose progeny still plough the same fields and kneel at the
same altar the parsonage a quaint irregular pile partly
antiquated but repaired and altered in the tastes of various ages and
occupants the stile and foot-path leading from the churchyard across
pleasant fields and along shady hedgerows according to an immemorial
right of way the neighboring village with its venerable cottages
its public green sheltered by trees under which the forefathers of the
present race have sported the antique family mansion standing apart
in some little rural domain but looking down with a protecting air on
the surrounding scene all these common features of english landscape
evince a calm and settled security a hereditary transmission of
homebred virtues and local attachments that speak deeply and touchingly
for the moral character of the nation

it is a pleasing sight of a sunday morning when the bell is sending
its sober melody across the quiet fields to behold the peasantry in
their best finery with ruddy faces and modest cheerfulness thronging
tranquilly along the green lanes to church but it is still more
pleasing to see them in the evenings gathering about their cottage
doors and appearing to exult in the humble comforts and embellishments
which their own hands have spread around them

it is this sweet home-feeling this settled repose of affection in the
domestic scene that is after all the parent of the steadiest virtues
and purest enjoyments and i cannot close these desultory remarks
better than by quoting the words of a modern english poet who has
depicted it with remarkable felicity

 through each gradation from the castled hall
 the city dome the villa crowned with shade
 but chief from modest mansions numberless
 in town or hamlet shelt'ring middle life
 down to the cottaged vale and straw-roof'd shed
 this western isle has long been famed for scenes
 where bliss domestic finds a dwelling-place
 domestic bliss that like a harmless dove
 honor and sweet endearment keeping guard
 can centre in a little quiet nest
 all that desire would fly for through the earth
 that can the world eluding be itself
 a world enjoyed that wants no witnesses
 but its own sharers and approving heaven
 that like a flower deep hid in rock cleft
 smiles though t is looking only at the sky


 from a poem on the death of the princess charlotte by the
 reverend rann kennedy am





the broken heart

 i never heard
 of any true affection but t was nipt
 with care that like the caterpillar eats
 the leaves of the spring's sweetest book the rose
 middleton

it is a common practice with those who have outlived the susceptibility
of early feeling or have been brought up in the gay heartlessness of
dissipated life to laugh at all love stories and to treat the tales
of romantic passion as mere fictions of novelists and poets my
observations on human nature have induced me to think otherwise they
have convinced me that however the surface of the character may be
chilled and frozen by the cares of the world or cultivated into mere
smiles by the arts of society still there are dormant fires lurking
in the depths of the coldest bosom which when once enkindled become
impetuous and are sometimes desolating in their effects indeed i am
a true believer in the blind deity and go to the full extent of his
doctrines shall i confess it i believe in broken hearts and the
possibility of dying of disappointed love i do not however consider
it a malady often fatal to my own sex but i firmly believe that it
withers down many a lovely woman into an early grave

man is the creature of interest and ambition his nature leads him forth
into the struggle and bustle of the world love is but the embellishment
of his early life or a song piped in the intervals of the acts he
seeks for fame for fortune for space in the world's thought and
dominion over his fellow-men but a woman's whole life is a history of
the affections the heart is her world it is there her ambition strives
for empire it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures she
sends forth her sympathies on adventure she embarks her whole soul in
the traffic of affection and if shipwrecked her case is hopeless for
it is a bankruptcy of the heart

to a man the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs
it wounds some feelings of tenderness it blasts some prospects of
felicity but he is an active being he may dissipate his thoughts in
the whirl of varied occupation or may plunge into the tide of pleasure
or if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations
he can shift his abode at will and taking as it were the wings of the
morning can fly to the uttermost parts of the earth and be at rest

but woman's is comparatively a fixed a secluded and meditative life
she is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings and if they
are turned to ministers of sorrow where shall she look for consolation
her lot is to be wooed and won and if unhappy in her love her heart
is like some fortress that has been captured and sacked and abandoned
and left desolate

how many bright eyes grow dim how many soft cheeks grow pale how many
lovely forms fade away into the tomb and none can tell the cause that
blighted their loveliness as the dove will clasp its wings to its side
and cover and conceal the arrow that is preying on its vitals so is
it the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs of wounded
affection the love of a delicate female is always shy and silent even
when fortunate she scarcely breathes it to herself but when otherwise
she buries it in the recesses of her bosom and there lets it cower and
brood among the ruins of her peace with her the desire of her heart
has failed the great charm of existence is at an end she neglects all
the cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits quicken the pulses
and send the tide of life in healthful currents through the veins her
rest is broken the sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy
dreams dry sorrow drinks her blood until her enfeebled frame sinks
under the slightest external injury look for her after a little while
and you find friendship weeping over her untimely grave and wondering
that one who but lately glowed with all the radiance of health and
beauty should so speedily be brought down to darkness and the worm
you will be told of some wintry chill some casual indisposition that
laid her low but no one knows of the mental malady which previously
sapped her strength and made her so easy a prey to the spoiler

she is like some tender tree the pride and beauty of the grove
graceful in its form bright in its foliage but with the worm preying
at its heart we find it suddenly withering when it should be most
fresh and luxuriant we see it drooping its branches to the earth and
shedding leaf by leaf until wasted and perished away it falls even in
the stillness of the forest and as we muse over the beautiful ruin
we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have
smitten it with decay

i have seen many instances of women running to waste and self-neglect
and disappearing gradually from the earth almost as if they had been
exhaled to heaven and have repeatedly fancied that i could trace their
deaths through the various declensions of consumption cold debility
languor melancholy until i reached the first symptom of disappointed
love but an instance of the kind was lately told to me the
circumstances are well known in the country where they happened and i
shall but give them in the manner in which they were related

every one must recollect the tragical story of young e the irish
patriot it was too touching to be soon forgotten during the troubles
in ireland he was tried condemned and executed on a charge of
treason his fate made a deep impression on public sympathy he was so
young so intelligent so generous so brave so every thing that we are
apt to like in a young man his conduct under trial too was so lofty
and intrepid the noble indignation with which he repelled the charge of
treason against his country the eloquent vindication of his
name and his pathetic appeal to posterity in the hopeless hour of
condemnation all these entered deeply into every generous bosom and
even his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution

but there was one heart whose anguish it would be impossible to
describe in happier days and fairer fortunes he had won the affections
of a beautiful and interesting girl the daughter of a late celebrated
irish barrister she loved him with the disinterested fervor of a
woman's first and early love when every worldly maxim arrayed itself
against him when blasted in fortune and disgrace and danger
darkened around his name she loved him the more ardently for his very
sufferings if then his fate could awaken the sympathy even of
his foes what must have been the agony of her whose whole soul was
occupied by his image let those tell who have had the portals of the
tomb suddenly closed between them and the being they most loved on
earth who have sat at its threshold as one shut out in a cold and
lonely world whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed

but then the horrors of such a grave so frightful so dishonored
there was nothing for memory to dwell on that could soothe the pang of
separation none of those tender though melancholy circumstances which
endear the parting scene nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed
tears sent like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parting
hour of anguish

to render her widowed situation more desolate she had incurred her
father's displeasure by her unfortunate attachment and was an exile
from the parental roof but could the sympathy and kind offices of
friends have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror she
would have experienced no want of consolation for the irish are a
people of quick and generous sensibilities the most delicate
and cherishing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and
distinction she was led into society and they tried by all kinds of
occupation and amusement to dissipate her grief and wean her from the
tragical story of her loves but it was all in vain there are some
strokes of calamity that scathe and scorch the soul which penetrate to
the vital seat of happiness and blast it never again to put forth bud
or blossom she never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure but
was as much alone there as in the depths of solitude walking about in a
sad revery apparently unconscious of the world around her she
carried with her an inward woe that mocked at all the blandishments of
friendship and heeded not the song of the charmer charm he never so
wisely

the person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade there can
be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and painful than
to meet it in such a scene to find it wandering like a spectre lonely
and joyless where all around is gay to see it dressed out in the
trappings of mirth and looking so wan and woe-begone as if it had
tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into momentary forgetfulness of
sorrow after strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with
an air of utter abstraction she sat herself down on the steps of an
orchestra and looking about for some time with a vacant air that
showed her insensibility to the garish scene she began with the
capriciousness of a sickly heart to warble a little plaintive air
she had an exquisite voice but on this occasion it was so simple so
touching it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness that she drew a
crowd mute and silent around her and melted every one into tears

the story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest
in a country remarkable for enthusiasm it completely won the heart of
a brave officer who paid his addresses to her and thought that one so
true to the dead could not but prove affectionate to the living she
declined his attentions for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed by
the memory of her former lover he however persisted in his suit he
solicited not her tenderness but her esteem he was assisted by
her conviction of his worth and her sense of her own destitute and
dependent situation for she was existing on the kindness of friends
in a word he at length succeeded in gaining her hand though with the
solemn assurance that her heart was unalterably another's

he took her with him to sicily hoping that a change of scene might
wear out the remembrance of early woes she was an amiable and exemplary
wife and made an effort to be a happy one but nothing could cure the
silent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very soul she
wasted away in a slow but hopeless decline and at length sunk into the
grave the victim of a broken heart

it was on her that moore the distinguished irish poet composed the
following lines

 she is far from the land where her young hero sleeps
 and lovers around her are sighing
 but coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps
 for her heart in his grave is lying

 she sings the wild song of her dear native plains
 every note which he loved awaking 
 ah little they think who delight in her strains
 how the heart of the minstrel is breaking

 he had lived for his love for his country he died
 they were all that to life had entwined him 
 nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried
 nor long will his love stay behind him

 oh make her a grave where the sunbeams rest
 when they promise a glorious morrow
 they'll shine o'er her sleep like a smile from the west
 from her own loved island of sorrow




the art of book-making

if that severe doom of synesius be true it is a greater offence to
steal dead men's labor than their clothes what shall become of most
writers burton's anatomy of melancholy

i have often wondered at the extreme fecundity of the press and how
it comes to pass that so many heads on which nature seems to have
inflicted the curse of barrenness should teem with voluminous
productions as a man travels on however in the journey of life his
objects of wonder daily diminish and he is continually finding out some
very simple cause for some great matter of marvel thus have i chanced
in my peregrinations about this great metropolis to blunder upon a
scene which unfolded to me some of the mysteries of the book-making
craft and at once put an end to my astonishment

i was one summer's day loitering through the great saloons of the
british museum with that listlessness with which one is apt to saunter
about a museum in warm weather sometimes lolling over the glass cases
of minerals sometimes studying the hieroglyphics on an egyptian mummy
and some times trying with nearly equal success to comprehend the
allegorical paintings on the lofty ceilings whilst i was gazing about
in this idle way my attention was attracted to a distant door at the
end of a suite of apartments it was closed but every now and then it
would open and some strange-favored being generally clothed in black
would steal forth and glide through the rooms without noticing any
of the surrounding objects there was an air of mystery about this that
piqued my languid curiosity and i determined to attempt the passage of
that strait and to explore the unknown regions beyond the door yielded
to my hand with all that facility with which the portals of enchanted
castles yield to the adventurous knight-errant i found myself in a
spacious chamber surrounded with great cases of venerable books above
the cases and just under the cornice were arranged a great number of
black-looking portraits of ancient authors about the room were placed
long tables with stands for reading and writing at which sat many
pale studious personages poring intently over dusty volumes rummaging
among mouldy manuscripts and taking copious notes of their contents
a hushed stillness reigned through this mysterious apartment excepting
that you might hear the racing of pens over sheets of paper and
occasionally the deep sigh of one of these sages as he shifted his
position to turn over the page of an old folio doubtless arising from
that hollowness and flatulency incident to learned research

now and then one of these personages would write something on a small
slip of paper and ring a bell whereupon a familiar would appear take
the paper in profound silence glide out of the room and return shortly
loaded with ponderous tomes upon which the other would fall tooth
and nail with famished voracity i had no longer a doubt that i had
happened upon a body of magi deeply engaged in the study of occult
sciences the scene reminded me of an old arabian tale of a philosopher
shut up in an enchanted library in the bosom of a mountain which
opened only once a year where he made the spirits of the place bring
him books of all kinds of dark knowledge so that at the end of the
year when the magic portal once more swung open on its hinges he
issued forth so versed in forbidden lore as to be able to soar above
the heads of the multitude and to control the powers of nature

my curiosity being now fully aroused i whispered to one of
the familiars as he was about to leave the room and begged an
interpretation of the strange scene before me a few words were
sufficient for the purpose i found that these mysterious personages
whom i had mistaken for magi were principally authors and were in the
very act of manufacturing books i was in fact in the reading-room of
the great british library an immense collection of volumes of all ages
and languages many of which are now forgotten and most of which are
seldom read one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature to
which modern authors repair and draw buckets full of classic lore or
pure english undefiled wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of
thought

being now in possession of the secret i sat down in a corner and
watched the process of this book manufactory i noticed one lean
bilious-looking wight who sought none but the most worm-eaten volumes
printed in black letter he was evidently constructing some work of
profound erudition that would be purchased by every man who wished to
be thought learned placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library or
laid open upon his table but never read i observed him now and then
draw a large fragment of biscuit out of his pocket and gnaw whether
it was his dinner or whether he was endeavoring to keep off that
exhaustion of the stomach produced by much pondering over dry works i
leave to harder students than myself to determine

there was one dapper little gentleman in bright-colored clothes with a
chirping gossiping expression of countenance who had all the appearance
of an author on good terms with his bookseller after considering him
attentively i recognized in him a diligent getter-up of miscellaneous
works which bustled off well with the trade i was curious to see how
he manufactured his wares he made more stir and show of business than
any of the others dipping into various books fluttering over the
leaves of manuscripts taking a morsel out of one a morsel out of
another line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there
a little the contents of his book seemed to be as heterogeneous as
those of the witches cauldron in macbeth it was here a finger and
there a thumb toe of frog and blind worm's sting with his own gossip
poured in like baboon's blood to make the medley slab and good

after all thought i may not this pilfering disposition be implanted in
authors for wise purposes may it not be the way in which providence
has taken care that the seeds of knowledge and wisdom shall be preserved
from age to age in spite of the inevitable decay of the works in
which they were first produced we see that nature has wisely though
whimsically provided for the conveyance of seeds from clime to clime
in the maws of certain birds so that animals which in themselves are
little better than carrion and apparently the lawless plunderers of the
orchard and the corn-field are in fact nature's carriers to disperse
and perpetuate her blessings in like manner the beauties and fine
thoughts of ancient and obsolete authors are caught up by these flights
of predatory writers and cast forth again to flourish and bear fruit
in a remote and distant tract of time many of their works also
undergo a kind of metempsychosis and spring up under new forms what
was formerly a ponderous history revives in the shape of a romance an
old legend changes into a modern play and a sober philosophical
treatise furnishes the body for a whole series of bouncing and sparkling
essays thus it is in the clearing of our american woodlands where we
burn down a forest of stately pines a progeny of dwarf oaks start up in
their place and we never see the prostrate trunk of a tree mouldering
into soil but it gives birth to a whole tribe of fungi

let us not then lament over the decay and oblivion into which ancient
writers descend they do but submit to the great law of nature which
declares that all sublunary shapes of matter shall be limited in their
duration but which decrees also that their element shall never
perish generation after generation both in animal and vegetable life
passes away but the vital principle is transmitted to posterity and
the species continue to flourish thus also do authors beget authors
and having produced a numerous progeny in a good old age they sleep
with their fathers that is to say with the authors who preceded
them and from whom they had stolen

whilst i was indulging in these rambling fancies i had leaned my head
against a pile of reverend folios whether it was owing to the soporific
emanations for these works or to the profound quiet of the room or
to the lassitude arising from much wandering or to an unlucky habit
of napping at improper times and places with which i am grievously
afflicted so it was that i fell into a doze still however my
imagination continued busy and indeed the same scene continued before
my mind's eye only a little changed in some of the details i dreamt
that the chamber was still decorated with the portraits of ancient
authors but that the number was increased the long tables had
disappeared and in place of the sage magi i beheld a ragged
threadbare throng such as may be seen plying about the great repository
of cast-off clothes monmouth street whenever they seized upon a book
by one of those incongruities common to dreams methought it turned into
a garment of foreign or antique fashion with which they proceeded to
equip themselves i noticed however that no one pretended to clothe
himself from any particular suit but took a sleeve from one a cape
from another a skirt from a third thus decking himself out piecemeal
while some of his original rags would peep out from among his borrowed
finery

there was a portly rosy well-fed parson whom i observed ogling
several mouldy polemical writers through an eyeglass he soon contrived
to slip on the voluminous mantle of one of the old fathers and having
purloined the gray beard of another endeavored to look exceedingly
wise but the smirking commonplace of his countenance set at naught
all the trappings of wisdom one sickly-looking gentleman was busied
embroidering a very flimsy garment with gold thread drawn out of several
old court-dresses of the reign of queen elizabeth another had trimmed
himself magnificently from an illuminated manuscript had stuck a
nosegay in his bosom culled from the paradise of dainty devices and
having put sir philip sidney's hat on one side of his head strutted off
with an exquisite air of vulgar elegance a third who was but of puny
dimensions had bolstered himself out bravely with the spoils from
several obscure tracts of philosophy so that he had a very imposing
front but he was lamentably tattered in rear and i perceived that
he had patched his small-clothes with scraps of parchment from a latin
author

there were some well-dressed gentlemen it is true who only helped
themselves to a gem or so which sparkled among their own ornaments
without eclipsing them some too seemed to contemplate the costumes
of the old writers merely to imbibe their principles of taste and to
catch their air and spirit but i grieve to say that too many were apt
to array themselves from top to toe in the patchwork manner i have
mentioned i shall not omit to speak of one genius in drab breeches
and gaiters and an arcadian hat who had a violent propensity to the
pastoral but whose rural wanderings had been confined to the classic
haunts of primrose hill and the solitudes of the regent's park he had
decked himself in wreaths and ribbons from all the old pastoral poets
and hanging his head on one side went about with a fantastical
lackadaisical air babbling about green field but the personage that
most struck my attention was a pragmatical old gentleman in clerical
robes with a remarkably large and square but bald head he entered the
room wheezing and puffing elbowed his way through the throng with a
look of sturdy self-confidence and having laid hands upon a thick
greek quarto clapped it upon his head and swept majestically away in a
formidable frizzled wig

in the height of this literary masquerade a cry suddenly resounded from
every side of thieves thieves i looked and lo the portraits about
the walls became animated the old authors thrust out first a head
then a shoulder from the canvas looked down curiously for an instant
upon the motley throng and then descended with fury in their eyes
to claim their rifled property the scene of scampering and hubbub that
ensued baffles all description the unhappy culprits endeavored in vain
to escape with their plunder on one side might be seen half a dozen
old monks stripping a modern professor on another there was sad
devastation carried into the ranks of modern dramatic writers beaumont
and fletcher side by side raged round the field like castor and
pollux and sturdy ben jonson enacted more wonders than when a volunteer
with the army in flanders as to the dapper little compiler of farragos
mentioned some time since he had arrayed himself in as many patches and
colors as harlequin and there was as fierce a contention of claimants
about him as about the dead body of patroclus i was grieved to
see many men to whom i had been accustomed to look up with awe and
reverence fain to steal off with scarce a rag to cover their nakedness
just then my eye was caught by the pragmatical old gentleman in the
greek grizzled wig who was scrambling away in sore affright with half
a score of authors in full cry after him they were close upon his
haunches in a twinkling off went his wig at every turn some strip of
raiment was peeled away until in a few moments from his domineering
pomp he shrunk into a little pursy chopp'd bald shot and made his
exit with only a few tags and rags fluttering at his back

there was something so ludicrous in the catastrophe of this learned
theban that i burst into an immoderate fit of laughter which broke the
whole illusion the tumult and the scuffle were at an end the chamber
resumed its usual appearance the old authors shrunk back into their
picture-frames and hung in shadowy solemnity along the walls in short
i found myself wide awake in my corner with the whole assemblage of
hookworms gazing at me with astonishment nothing of the dream had been
real but my burst of laughter a sound never before heard in that grave
sanctuary and so abhorrent to the ears of wisdom as to electrify the
fraternity

the librarian now stepped up to me and demanded whether i had a card of
admission at first i did not comprehend him but i soon found that the
library was a kind of literary preserve subject to game-laws and
that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and
permission in a word i stood convicted of being an arrant poacher and
was glad to make a precipitate retreat lest i should have a whole pack
of authors let loose upon me




a royal poet

 though your body be confined
 and soft love a prisoner bound
 yet the beauty of your mind
 neither check nor chain hath found
 look out nobly then and dare
 even the fetters that you wear
 fletcher

on a soft sunny morning in the genial month of may i made an excursion
to windsor castle it is a place full of storied and poetical
associations the very external aspect of the proud old pile is enough
to inspire high thought it rears its irregular walls and massive
towers like a mural crown around the brow of a lofty ridge waves its
royal banner in the clouds and looks down with a lordly air upon the
surrounding world

on this morning the weather was of that voluptuous vernal kind which
calls forth all the latent romance of a man's temperament filling his
mind with music and disposing him to quote poetry and dream of beauty
in wandering through the magnificent saloons and long echoing galleries
of the castle i passed with indifference by whole rows of portraits
of warriors and statesmen but lingered in the chamber where hang the
likenesses of the beauties which graced the gay court of charles
the second and as i gazed upon them depicted with amorous
half-dishevelled tresses and the sleepy eye of love i blessed the
pencil of sir peter lely which had thus enabled me to bask in the
reflected rays of beauty in traversing also the large green courts
with sunshine beaming on the gray walls and glancing along the velvet
turf my mind was engrossed with the image of the tender the gallant
but hapless surrey and his account of his loiterings about them in his
stripling days when enamoured of the lady geraldine 

 with eyes cast up unto the maiden's tower
 with easie sighs such as men draw in love

in this mood of mere poetical susceptibility i visited the ancient keep
of the castle where james the first of scotland the pride and theme of
scottish poets and historians was for many years of his youth detained
a prisoner of state it is a large gray tower that has stood the brunt
of ages and is still in good preservation it stands on a mound which
elevates it above the other parts of the castle and a great flight of
steps leads to the interior in the armory a gothic hall furnished with
weapons of various kinds and ages i was shown a coat of armor hanging
against the wall which had once belonged to james hence i
was conducted up a staircase to a suite of apartments of faded
magnificence hung with storied tapestry which formed his prison and
the scene of that passionate and fanciful amour which has woven into
the web of his story the magical hues of poetry and fiction

the whole history of this amiable but unfortunate prince is highly
romantic at the tender age of eleven he was sent from home by his
father robert iii and destined for the french court to be reared
under the eye of the french monarch secure from the treachery and
danger that surrounded the royal house of scotland it was his mishap
in the course of his voyage to fall into the hands of the english
and he was detained prisoner by henry iv notwithstanding that a truce
existed between the two countries

the intelligence of his capture coming in the train of many sorrows and
disasters proved fatal to his unhappy father the news we are told
was brought to him while at supper and did so overwhelm him with grief
that he was almost ready to give up the ghost into the hands of the
servants that attended him but being carried to his bedchamber he
abstained from all food and in three days died of hunger and grief at
rothesay

james was detained in captivity above eighteen years but though
deprived of personal liberty he was treated with the respect due to
his rank care was taken to instruct him in all the branches of useful
knowledge cultivated at that period and to give him those mental and
personal accomplishments deemed proper for a prince perhaps in this
respect his imprisonment was an advantage as it enabled him to apply
himself the more exclusively to his improvement and quietly to imbibe
that rich fund of knowledge and to cherish those elegant tastes which
have given such a lustre to his memory the picture drawn of him in
early life by the scottish historians is highly captivating and seems
rather the description of a hero of romance than of a character in real
history he was well learnt we are told to fight with the sword
to joust to tourney to wrestle to sing and dance he was an expert
mediciner right crafty in playing both of lute and harp and sundry
other instruments of music and was expert in grammar oratory and
poetry


 ballenden's translation of hector boyce


with this combination of manly and delicate accomplishments fitting him
to shine both in active and elegant life and calculated to give him an
intense relish for joyous existence it must have been a severe trial
in an age of bustle and chivalry to pass the spring-time of his years
in monotonous captivity it was the good fortune of james however to
be gifted with a powerful poetic fancy and to be visited in his prison
by the choicest inspirations of the muse some minds corrode and grow
inactive under the loss of personal liberty others grow morbid
and irritable but it is the nature of the poet to become tender and
imaginative in the loneliness of confinement he banquets upon the honey
of his own thoughts and like the captive bird pours forth his soul in
melody

 have you not seen the nightingale
 a pilgrim coop'd into a cage
 how doth she chant her wonted tale
 in that her lonely hermitage
 even there her charming melody doth prove
 that all her boughs are trees her cage a grove

 roger l'estrange

indeed it is the divine attribute of the imagination that it is
irrepressible unconfinable that when the real world is shut out
it can create a world for itself and with a necromantic power can
conjure up glorious shapes and forms and brilliant visions to make
solitude populous and irradiate the gloom of the dungeon such was the
world of pomp and pageant that lived round tasso in his dismal cell at
ferrara when he conceived the splendid scenes of his jerusalem and we
may consider the king's quair composed by james during his captivity
at windsor as another of those beautiful breakings forth of the soul
from the restraint and gloom of the prison-house

the subject of the poem is his love for the lady jane beaufort daughter
of the earl of somerset and a princess of the blood-royal of england
of whom he became enamoured in the course of his captivity what gives
it a peculiar value is that it may be considered a transcript of
the royal bard's true feelings and the story of his real loves and
fortunes it is not often that sovereigns write poetry or that poets
deal in fact it is gratifying to the pride of a common man to find
a monarch thus suing as it were for admission into his closet and
seeking to win his favor by administering to his pleasures it is a
proof of the honest equality of intellectual competition which strips
off all the trappings of factitious dignity brings the candidate down
to a level with his fellow-men and obliges him to depend on his own
native powers for distinction it is curious too to get at the history
of a monarch's heart and to find the simple affections of human nature
throbbing under the ermine but james had learnt to be a poet before he
was a king he was schooled in adversity and reared in the company of
his own thoughts monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts
or to meditate their minds into poetry and had james been brought up
amidst the adulation and gayety of a court we should never in all
probability have had such a poem as the quair


 quair an old term for book


i have been particularly interested by those parts of the poem which
breathe his immediate thoughts concerning his situation or which are
connected with the apartment in the tower they have thus a personal and
local charm and are given with such circumstantial truth as to make the
reader present with the captive in his prison and the companion of his
meditations

such is the account which he gives of his weariness of spirit and of
the incident which first suggested the idea of writing the poem it was
the still mid-watch of a clear moonlight night the stars he says were
twinkling as fire in the high vault of heaven and cynthia rinsing her
golden locks in aquarius he lay in bed wakeful and restless and took
a book to beguile the tedious hours the book he chose was boetius
consolations of philosophy a work popular among the writers of that
day and which had been translated by his great prototype chaucer from
the high eulogium in which he indulges it is evident this was one of
his favorite volumes while in prison and indeed it is an admirable
text-book for meditation under adversity it is the legacy of a noble
and enduring spirit purified by sorrow and suffering bequeathing to
its successors in calamity the maxims of sweet morality and the trains
of eloquent but simple reasoning by which it was enabled to bear
up against the various ills of life it is a talisman which the
unfortunate may treasure up in his bosom or like the good king james
lay upon his nightly pillow

after closing the volume he turns its contents over in his mind and
gradually falls into a fit of musing on the fickleness of fortune the
vicissitudes of his own life and the evils that had overtaken him even
in his tender youth suddenly he hears the bell ringing to matins but
its sound chiming in with his melancholy fancies seems to him like a
voice exhorting him to write his story in the spirit of poetic errantry
he determines to comply with this intimation he therefore takes pen in
hand makes with it a sign of the cross to implore a benediction
and sallies forth into the fairy-land of poetry there is something
extremely fanciful in all this and it is interesting as furnishing
a striking and beautiful instance of the simple manner in which
whole trains of poetical thought are sometimes awakened and literary
enterprises suggested to the mind

in the course of his poem he more than once bewails the peculiar
hardness of his fate thus doomed to lonely and inactive life and
shut up from the freedom and pleasure of the world in which the meanest
animal indulges unrestrained there is a sweetness however in his very
complaints they are the lamentations of an amiable and social spirit at
being denied the indulgence of its kind and generous propensities there
is nothing in them harsh nor exaggerated they flow with a natural and
touching pathos and are perhaps rendered more touching by their
simple brevity they contrast finely with those elaborate and iterated
repinings which we sometimes meet with in poetry the effusions of
morbid minds sickening under miseries of their own creating and
venting their bitterness upon an unoffending world james speaks of his
privations with acute sensibility but having mentioned them passes on
as if his manly mind disdained to brood over unavoidable calamities
when such a spirit breaks forth into complaint however brief we
are aware how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur we
sympathize with james a romantic active and accomplished prince cut
off in the lustihood of youth from all the enterprise the noble uses
and vigorous delights of life as we do with milton alive to all the
beauties of nature and glories of art when he breathes forth brief but
deep-toned lamentations over his perpetual blindness

had not james evinced a deficiency of poetic artifice we might almost
have suspected that these lowerings of gloomy reflection were meant as
preparative to the brightest scene of his story and to contrast with
that refulgence of light and loveliness that exhilarating accompaniment
of bird and song and foliage and flower and all the revel of the
year with which he ushers in the lady of his heart it is this scene
in particular which throws all the magic of romance about the old
castle keep he had risen he says at daybreak according to custom to
escape from the dreary meditations of a sleepless pillow bewailing in
his chamber thus alone despairing of all joy and remedy for tired
of thought and woe-begone he had wandered to the window to indulge
the captive's miserable solace of gazing wistfully upon the world from
which he is excluded the window looked forth upon a small garden which
lay at the foot of the tower it was a quiet sheltered spot adorned
with arbors and green alleys and protected from the passing gaze by
trees and hawthorn hedges

 now was there made fast by the tower's wall
 a garden faire and in the corners set
 an arbour green with wandis long and small
 railed about and so with leaves beset
 was all the place and hawthorn hedges knet
 that lyf was none walkyng there forbye
 that might within scarce any wight espye

 so thick the branches and the leves grene
 beshaded all the alleys that there were
 and midst of every arbour might be seen
 the sharpe grene swete juniper
 growing so fair with branches here and there
 that as it seemed to a lyf without
 the boughs did spread the arbour all about

 and on the small grene twistis set
 the lytel swete nightingales and sung
 so loud and clear the hymnis consecrate
 of lovis use now soft now loud among
 that all the garden and the wallis rung
 right of their song 


 lyf person

 twistis small boughs or twigs note the language of the
 quotations is generally modernized


it was the month of may when every thing was in bloom and he
interprets the song of the nightingale into the language of his
enamoured feeling

 worship all ye that lovers be this may
 for of your bliss the kalends are begun
 and sing with us away winter away
 come summer come the sweet season and sun

as he gazes on the scene and listens to the notes of the birds he
gradually relapses into one of those tender and undefinable reveries
which fill the youthful bosom in this delicious season he wonders what
this love may be of which he has so often read and which thus seems
breathed forth in the quickening breath of may and melting all nature
into ecstasy and song if it really be so great a felicity and if it be
a boon thus generally dispensed to the most insignificant beings why is
he alone cut off from its enjoyments

 oft would i think o lord what may this be
 that love is of such noble myght and kynde
 loving his folke and such prosperitee
 is it of him as we in books do find
 may he oure hertes setten and unbynd
 hath he upon oure hertes such maistrye
 or is all this but feynit fantasye

 for giff he be of so grete excellence
 that he of every wight hath care and charge
 what have i gilt to him or done offense
 that i am thral'd and birdis go at large


 setten incline

 gilt what injury have i done etc


in the midst of his musing as he casts his eye downward he beholds
the fairest and the freshest young floure that ever he had seen it is
the lovely lady jane walking in the garden to enjoy the beauty of that
fresh may morrowe breaking thus suddenly upon his sight in a moment
of loneliness and excited susceptibility she at once captivates the
fancy of the romantic prince and becomes the object of his wandering
wishes the sovereign of his ideal world

there is in this charming scene an evident resemblance to the early
part of chaucer's knight's tale where palamon and arcite fall in
love with emilia whom they see walking in the garden of their prison
perhaps the similarity of the actual fact to the incident which he had
read in chaucer may have induced james to dwell on it in his poem his
description of the lady jane is given in the picturesque and minute
manner of his master and being doubtless taken from the life is a
perfect portrait of a beauty of that day he dwells with the fondness
of a lover on every article of her apparel from the net of pearl
splendent with emeralds and sapphires that confined her golden hair
even to the goodly chaine of small orfeverye about her neck whereby
there hung a ruby in shape of a heart that seemed he says like a
spark of fire burning upon her white bosom her dress of white
tissue was looped up to enable her to walk with more freedom she was
accompanied by two female attendants and about her sported a little
hound decorated with bells probably the small italian hound of
exquisite symmetry which was a parlor favorite and pet among the
fashionable dames of ancient times james closes his description by a
burst of general eulogium

 in her was youth beauty with humble port
 bounty richesse and womanly feature
 god better knows than my pen can report
 wisdom largesse estate and cunning sure
 in every point so guided her measure
 in word in deed in shape in countenance
 that nature might no more her child advance


 wrought gold

 largesse bounty

 estate dignity

 cunning discretion


the departure of the lady jane from the garden puts an end to this
transient riot of the heart with her departs the amorous illusion
that had shed a temporary charm over the scene of his captivity and he
relapses into loneliness now rendered tenfold more intolerable by this
passing beam of unattainable beauty through the long and weary day he
repines at his unhappy lot and when evening approaches and phoebus
as he beautifully expresses it had bade farewell to every leaf and
flower he still lingers at the window and laying his head upon the
cold stone gives vent to a mingled flow of love and sorrow until
gradually lulled by the mute melancholy of the twilight hour he lapses
half-sleeping half swoon into a vision which occupies the remainder
of the poem and in which is allegorically shadowed out the history of
his passion

when he wakes from his trance he rises from his stony pillow and
pacing his apartment full of dreary reflections questions his spirit
whither it has been wandering whether indeed all that has
passed before his dreaming fancy has been conjured up by preceding
circumstances or whether it is a vision intended to comfort and assure
him in his despondency if the latter he prays that some token may be
sent to confirm the promise of happier days given him in his slumbers
suddenly a turtledove of the purest whiteness comes flying in at the
window and alights upon his hand bearing in her bill a branch of red
gilliflower on the leaves of which is written in letters of gold the
following sentence

 awake awake i bring lover i bring
 the newis glad that blissful is and sure
 of thy comfort now laugh and play and sing
 for in the heaven decretit is thy cure

he receives the branch with mingled hope and dread reads it with
rapture and this he says was the first token of his succeeding
happiness whether this is a mere poetic fiction or whether the lady
jane did actually send him a token of her favor in this romantic way
remains to be determined according to the fate or fancy of the reader
he concludes his poem by intimating that the promise conveyed in the
vision and by the flower is fulfilled by his being restored to liberty
and made happy in the possession of the sovereign of his heart

such is the poetical account given by james of his love adventures
in windsor castle how much of it is absolute fact and how much the
embellishment of fancy it is fruitless to conjecture let us not
however reject every romantic incident as incompatible with real life
but let us sometimes take a poet at his word i have noticed merely
those parts of the poem immediately connected with the tower and have
passed over a large part which was in the allegorical vein so
much cultivated at that day the language of course is quaint and
antiquated so that the beauty of many of its golden phrases will
scarcely be perceived at the present day but it is impossible not to
be charmed with the genuine sentiment the delightful artlessness and
urbanity which prevail throughout it the descriptions of nature too
with which it is embellished are given with a truth a discrimination
and a freshness worthy of the most cultivated periods of the art

as an amatory poem it is edifying in these days of coarser thinking
to notice the nature refinement and exquisite delicacy which
pervade it banishing every gross thought or immodest expression and
presenting female loveliness clothed in all its chivalrous attributes
of almost supernatural purity and grace

james flourished nearly about the time of chaucer and gower and was
evidently an admirer and studier of their writings indeed in one of
his stanzas he acknowledges them as his masters and in some parts
of his poem we find traces of similarity to their productions more
especially to those of chaucer there are always however general
features of resemblance in the works of contemporary authors which are
not so much borrowed from each other as from the times writers like
bees toll their sweets in the wide world they incorporate with their
own conceptions the anecdotes and thoughts current in society and thus
each generation has some features in common characteristic of the age
in which it lives

james belongs to one of the most brilliant eras of our literary history
and establishes the claims of his country to a participation in
its primitive honors whilst a small cluster of english writers are
constantly cited as the fathers of our verse the name of their
great scottish compeer is apt to be passed over in silence but he
is evidently worthy of being enrolled in that little constellation of
remote but never-failing luminaries who shine in the highest firmament
of literature and who like morning stars sang together at the bright
dawning of british poesy

such of my readers as may not be familiar with scottish history though
the manner in which it has of late been woven with captivating fiction
has made it a universal study may be curious to learn something of the
subsequent history of james and the fortunes of his love his passion
for the lady jane as it was the solace of his captivity so it
facilitated his release it being imagined by the court that a
connection with the blood-royal of england would attach him to its own
interests he was ultimately restored to his liberty and crown having
previously espoused the lady jane who accompanied him to scotland and
made him a most tender and devoted wife

he found his kingdom in great confusion the feudal chieftains
having taken advantage of the troubles and irregularities of a long
interregnum to strengthen themselves in their possessions and place
themselves above the power of the laws james sought to found the basis
of his power in the affections of his people he attached the lower
orders to him by the reformation of abuses the temperate and equable
administration of justice the encouragement of the arts of peace and
the promotion of every thing that could diffuse comfort competency
and innocent enjoyment through the humblest ranks of society he
mingled occasionally among the common people in disguise visited
their firesides entered into their cares their pursuits and their
amusements informed himself of the mechanical arts and how they could
best be patronized and improved and was thus an all-pervading spirit
watching with a benevolent eye over the meanest of his subjects having
in this generous manner made himself strong in the hearts of the common
people he turned himself to curb the power of the factious nobility
to strip them of those dangerous immunities which they had usurped to
punish such as had been guilty of flagrant offences and to bring the
whole into proper obedience to the crown for some time they bore
this with outward submission but with secret impatience and brooding
resentment a conspiracy was at length formed against his life at the
head of which was his own uncle robert stewart earl of athol who
being too old himself for the perpetration of the deed of blood
instigated his grandson sir robert stewart together with sir robert
graham and others of less note to commit the deed they broke into his
bedchamber at the dominican convent near perth where he was residing
and barbarously murdered him by oft-repeated wounds his faithful queen
rushing to throw her tender body between him and the sword was twice
wounded in the ineffectual attempt to shield him from the assassin and
it was not until she had been forcibly torn from his person that the
murder was accomplished

it was the recollection of this romantic tale of former times and of
the golden little poem which had its birthplace in this tower that
made me visit the old pile with more than common interest the suit
of armor hanging up in the hall richly gilt and embellished as if to
figure in the tourney brought the image of the gallant and romantic
prince vividly before my imagination i paced the deserted chambers
where he had composed his poem i leaned upon the window and endeavored
to persuade myself it was the very one where he had been visited by
his vision i looked out upon the spot where he had first seen the lady
jane it was the same genial and joyous month the birds were again
vying with each other in strains of liquid melody every thing was
bursting into vegetation and budding forth the tender promise of the
year time which delights to obliterate the sterner memorials of human
pride seems to have passed lightly over this little scene of poetry and
love and to have withheld his desolating hand several centuries have
gone by yet the garden still flourishes at the foot of the tower it
occupies what was once the moat of the keep and though some parts have
been separated by dividing walls yet others have still their arbors
and shaded walks as in the days of james and the whole is sheltered
blooming and retired there is a charm about the spot that has been
printed by the footsteps of departed beauty and consecrated by the
inspirations of the poet which is heightened rather than impaired by
the lapse of ages it is indeed the gift of poetry to hallow every
place in which it moves to breathe around nature an odor more exquisite
than the perfume of the rose and to shed over it a tint more magical
than the blush of morning

others may dwell on the illustrious deeds of james as a warrior and a
legislator but i have delighted to view him merely as the companion
of his fellow-men the benefactor of the human heart stooping from his
high estate to sow the sweet flowers of poetry and song in the paths of
common life he was the first to cultivate the vigorous and hardy plant
of scottish genius which has since become so prolific of the most
wholesome and highly flavored fruit he carried with him into the
sterner regions of the north all the fertilizing arts of southern
refinement he did every thing in his power to win his countrymen to the
gay the elegant and gentle arts which soften and refine the character
of a people and wreathe a grace round the loftiness of a proud and
warlike spirit he wrote many poems which unfortunately for the
fulness of his fame are now lost to the world one which is still
preserved called christ's kirk of the green shows how diligently he
had made himself acquainted with the rustic sports and pastimes which
constitute such a source of kind and social feeling among the scottish
peasantry and with what simple and happy humor he could enter into
their enjoyments he contributed greatly to improve the national music
and traces of his tender sentiment and elegant taste are said to exist
in those witching airs still piped among the wild mountains and lonely
glens of scotland he has thus connected his image with whatever is most
gracious and endearing in the national character he has embalmed his
memory in song and floated his name to after-ages in the rich streams
of scottish melody the recollection of these things was kindling at my
heart as i paced the silent scene of his imprisonment i have visited
vaucluse with as much enthusiasm as a pilgrim would visit the shrine
at loretto but i have never felt more poetical devotion than when
contemplating the old tower and the little garden at windsor and
musing over the romantic loves of the lady jane and the royal poet of
scotland




the country church

 a gentleman
 what o the woolpack or the sugar-chest
 or lists of velvet which is t pound or yard
 you vend your gentry by
 beggar's bush

there are few places more favorable to the study of character than an
english country church i was once passing a few weeks at the seat of
a friend who resided in the vicinity of one the appearance of which
particularly struck my fancy it was one of those rich morsels of quaint
antiquity which gives such a peculiar charm to english landscape
it stood in the midst of a country filled with ancient families and
contained within its cold and silent aisles the congregated dust of many
noble generations the interior walls were encrusted with monuments
of every age and style the light streamed through windows dimmed with
armorial bearings richly emblazoned in stained glass in various parts
of the church were tombs of knights and highborn dames of gorgeous
workmanship with their effigies in colored marble on every side the
eye was struck with some instance of aspiring mortality some haughty
memorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust in this
temple of the most humble of all religions

the congregation was composed of the neighboring people of rank who sat
in pews sumptuously lined and cushioned furnished with richly-gilded
prayer-books and decorated with their arms upon the pew doors of the
villagers and peasantry who filled the back seats and a small gallery
beside the organ and of the poor of the parish who were ranged on
benches in the aisles

the service was performed by a snuffling well-fed vicar who had a snug
dwelling near the church he was a privileged guest at all the tables
of the neighborhood and had been the keenest fox-hunter in the country
until age and good living had disabled him from doing anything more than
ride to see the hounds throw off and make one at the hunting dinner

under the ministry of such a pastor i found it impossible to get into
the train of thought suitable to the time and place so having like
many other feeble christians compromised with my conscience by laying
the sin of my own delinquency at another person's threshold i occupied
myself by making observations on my neighbors

i was as yet a stranger in england and curious to notice the manners
of its fashionable classes i found as usual that there was the least
pretension where there was the most acknowledged title to respect i was
particularly struck for instance with the family of a nobleman of high
rank consisting of several sons and daughters nothing could be more
simple and unassuming than their appearance they generally came to
church in the plainest equipage and often on foot the young ladies
would stop and converse in the kindest manner with the peasantry caress
the children

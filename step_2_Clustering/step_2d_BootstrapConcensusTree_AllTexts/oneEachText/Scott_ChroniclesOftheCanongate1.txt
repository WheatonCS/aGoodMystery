every quarter edinburgh has its own peculiar
boast so that the city together combines
within its precincts if you take the word 
the inhabitants on the subject as much variety
as beauty as much historical interest as
 natural sublimity our claims in behalf 
the canongate are not the slightest or least interesting
the castle may excel us in extent
 prospect and natural sublimity site the
canton had always the superiority its unrivalled
panorama and has late added to them
that its towers bridges and triumphal arches
the high street we acknowledge had the distinguished
honour being defended by fortifications
 which we can show no vestiges we will
not descend to notice the claims mere upstart
districts called old new town and new
new town not to mention the favourite moray
place which is the newest new town all
we will not match ourselves except with our
equals and with our equals in age only for indignity
we admit none we boast being the
court the town possessing the palace
and the sepulchral remains ancient monarchs
and that we have the power to excite in a degree
unknown to the less honoured quarters 
the city the dark and solemn recollections 
the ancient grandeur which occupied the precincts
 our venerable abbey from the time 
st david till her deserted halls were once more
made glad and her long silent echoes awakened
by the visit our present gracious sovereign

my long habitation in the neighbourhood
and the quiet respectability my habits have
given me a sort intimacy with good mrs
the housekeeper in that most interesting
part the old building called queen
mary's apartments but a circumstance which
lately happened has conferred upon me greater
privileges so that indeed i might i believe
venture on the exploit chaplet who was
executed for being found secreted at midnight
in the very bedchamber scotland's mistress
it chanced that the good lady i have mentioned
was in the discharge her function
showing the apartments to a cockney from london
 not one your quiet dull commonplace
visitors who gape yawn and listen with an acquiescent
humph to the information doled out by
the provincial cicerone no such thing this was
the brisk alert agent a great house in the city
who missed no opportunity doing business
as he termed it that is putting off the goods
 his hemp oyer and improving his own account
 commission he had fidgeted through
the suite apartments without finding the least
opportunity to touch upon that which he considered
as the principal his existence
even the story rizzio's assassination presented
no ideas to this emissary commerce
until the housekeeper appealed in support 
her narrative to the dusky stains blood upon
the floor
these are the stains she said nothing
will remove them from the place there they
have been for two hundred and fifty years 
and there they will remain while the floor is
left standing neither water nor anything else
will ever remove them from that spot
now our cockney amongst other articles
sold scouring drops as they are called and
a stain two hundred and fifty years standing
was interesting to him not because it had been
caused by the blood a queen's favourite
slain in her apartment but because it offered
so admirable an opportunity to prove the efficacy
 his unequalled detergent elixir down
on his knees went our friend but neither in
horror nor devotion
two hundred and fifty years ma'am and
nothing take it away why if it had been five
hundred i have something in my pocket will
fetch it out in five minutes d'ye see this
elixir ma'am i will show you the stain vanish
in a moment
accordingly whetting one his handkerchief
with the alldeterging specific he began
to rub away on the planks without heeding
the remonstrances mrs she good
soul stood at first in astonishment like the
abbess st bridget's when a profane visitant
drank up the vial brandy which had long
passed muster among the relics the cloister
for the tears the blessed saint the venerable
guardian st bridget probably expected
the interference her patroness she
 holy rood might perhaps hope that david
rizzio's spectre would arise to prevent the
profanation but mrs stood not long in
the silence horror she uplifted her voice
and screamed as loudly as queen mary herself
when the dreadful deed was in the act perpetration

harrow now out and walawa she cried
i happened to be taking my morning walk in
the adjoining gallery pondering in my mind
why the kings scotland who hung around
me should be each and every one painted with
a nose like the knocker a door when lo the
walls once more reechoed with such shrieks as
formerly were as often heard in the scottish
palaces as were sounds revelry and music
somewhat surprised at such an alarm in a place
so solitary i hastened to the spot and found
the wellmeaning traveller scrubbing the floor
like a housemaid while mrs dragging
him by the skirts the coat in vain endeavoured
to divert him from his sacrilegious purpose
it cost me some trouble to explain to the
zealous purifier silkstockings embroidered
waistcoats broadcloth and deal planks that
there were such things in the world as stains
which ought to remain indelible on account
 the associations with which they are connected
our good friend viewed everything oi
the kind only as the means displaying the
virtue his vaunted commodity he comprehended
however that he would not be permitted
to proceed to exemplify its powers on the
present occasion so took his leave muttering
that he had always heard the scots were a
nasty people but had no idea they carried it sofar
as to choose to have the floors their palaces
bloodaltered like banquo's ghost when to
remove them would have cost but a hundred
drops the infallible detergent elixir prepared
and sold by messrs scrub and rub in five
shilling and ten shilling bottles each bottle being
marked with the initials the inventor to
counterfeit which would be to incur the pains
 forgery
freed from the odious presence this lover
 cleanliness my good friend mrs was
profuse in her expressions thanks and
yet her gratitude instead exhausting itself
in these declarations according to the way 
the world continues as lively at this moment
as if she had never thanked me at all it is
owing to her recollection this piece good
service that i have the permission wandering
like the ghost some departed gentlemanusher
through these deserted halls sometimes
as the old irish ditty expresses it
thinking on things that are long enough ago 
and sometimes wishing i could with the good
luck most editors romantic narrative
light upon some hidden crypt or massive antique
cabinet which should yield to my researches
an almost illegible manuscript containing
the authentic particulars some the
strange deeds those wild days the unhappy
mary
my dear mrs baliol used to sympathize with
me when i regretted that all the godsend 
this nature had ceased to occur and that an author
might chatter his teeth to pieces by the
seaside without a wave ever wafting to him a
casket containing such a history as that automatic
 that he might break his shins in
stumbling through a hundred vaults without
finding anything but rats and mice and become
the tenant a dozen sets shabby tenements
without seeing any manuscript but the weekly
bill for board and lodging a dairymaid 
these degenerate days might as well wash and
deck her dairy in hopes finding the fairy tester
in her shoe
it is a sad and too true a tale cousin
said mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasion
to regret the want these ready supplements
to a failing invention but you most 
all have right to complain that the fairies have
not favoured your researches you who have
shown the world that the age chivalry still
exists you the knight croftangry who
braved the fury the london prentice bold
in behalf the fair dame and the memorial
 rizzio's slaughter is it not a pity cousin
considering the feat chivalry was otherwise
so much according to rule is it not i
say a great pity that the lady had not been a
little younger and the legend a little older 
why as to the age at which a fair dame
loses the benefits chivalry and is no longer
entitled o crave boon brave knight that i
u
leave to the statutes the order errantry 
but for the blood rizzio i take up the gauntlet
and maintain against all and sundry that i
hold the stains to be no modern date but
to have been actually the consequence and the
record that terrible assassination
as i cannot accept the challenge to the
field fair cousin i am contented to require
proof
the unaltered tradition the palace and
the correspondence the existing state things
with that tradition
explain if you please
i will the universal tradition bears that
when rizzio was dragged out the chamber 
the queen the heat and fury the assassins
who struggled which should deal him most
wounds dispatched him at the door the anteroom
there therefore the greater quantity
 the blood was spilled and there the marks 
it are still shown it is reported further by historians
that mary continued her entreaties for
his life mingling her prayers with screams and
exclamations until she knew that he was assuredly
slain on which she wiped her eyes and
said i will now study revenge 
all this is granted but the blood would
it not wash out or waste out think you in so
many years 
i am coming to that presently the constant
tradition the palace says that mary
discharged any measures to be taken to remove
the marks slaughter which she had resolved
should remain as a memorial to quicken and
confirm her purposed vengeance but it is added
that satisfied with the knowledge that it
existed and not desirous to have the ghastly
evidence always under her eye she caused
a traverse as it is called that is a temporary
screen boards to be drawn along the
under part the anteroom a few feet from
the door so as to separate the place stained
with the blood from the rest the apartment
and involve it in considerable obscurity now
this temporary partition still exists and by
running across and interrupting the plan 
the roof and cornices plainly intimates that it
has been intended to serve some temporary
purpose since it disfigures the proportions 
the room interferes with the ornaments the
ceiling and could only have been put there for
some such purpose as hiding an object too disagreeable
to be looked upon as to the objection
that the bloodstains would have disappeared
in course time i apprehend that if measures
to efface them were not taken immediately
after the affair happened if the blood in
other words were allowed to sink into the
wood the stain would become almost indelible
now not to mention that our scottish palaces
were not particularly well washed in those days
and that there were no patent drops to assist
the labours the mop i think it very probable
that these dark relics might subsist for a long
course time even if mary had not desired or directed
that they should be preserved but screened
by the traverse from public sight i know
several instances similar bloodstains remaining
for a great many years and i doubt whether
after a certain time anything can remove
them save the carpenter's plane if any seneschal
by way increasing the interest the
apartments had by means paint or any other
mode imitation endeavoured to palm upon
posterity supposititious stigmata i conceive that
the impostor would have chosen the queers cabinet
and the bedroom for the scene his trick
placing his bloody tracery where it could be distinctly
seen by visitors instead hiding it behind
the traverse in this manner the existence
 the said traverse or temporary partition is
also extremely difficult to be accounted for if the
common and ordinary tradition be rejected in
short all the rest this striking locality is so
true to the historical fact that i think it may
well bear out the additional circumstance the
blood on the floor
 i profess to you answered mrs baliol
that i am very willing to be converted to
your faith we talk a credulous vulgar
without always recollecting that there is a vulgar
incredulity which in historical matters as
well as in those religion finds it easier to
doubt than to examine and endeavours to assume
the credit an esprit fort by denying
o
whatever happens to be a little beyond the very
limited comprehension the sceptic and so
that point being settled and you possessing as
we understand the open sesamum into these
secret apartments how if we may ask do you
intend to avail yourself your privilege 
do you propose to pass the night in the royal
bedchamber 
for what purpose my dear lady if to
improve the rheumatism this east wind may
serve the purpose
improve the rheumatism heaven forbid 
that would be worse than adding colours to the
violet no i mean to recommend a night on
the couch the rose scotland merely to
improve the imagination who knows what
dreams might be produced by a night spent ina
mansion so many memories for aught i
know the iron door the postern stair might
open at the dead hour midnight and as at the
time the conspiracy forth might sally the
phantom assassins with stealthy step and ghastly
look to renew the semblance the deed
there comes the fierce fanatic ruthven party
hatred enabling him to bear the armour which
would otherwise weigh down a form extenuated
by wasting disease see how his writhen
features show under the hollow helmet like
those a corpse tenanted by a demon whose
vindictive purpose looks out at the flashing eyes
while the visage has the stillness death 
yonder appears the tall form the boy darnley
as goodly in person as vacillating in resolution
 yonder he advances with hesitating step
and yet more hesitating purpose his childish
fear having already overcome his childish passion
he is in the plight a mischievous boy
who has fired a mine and who now expecting
the explosion in remorse and terror would give
his life to quench the train which his own hand
lighted yonder yonder but i forget the
rest the worthy cutthroats help me if
you can
summon up said i the postulate
george douglas the most active the gang
let him arise at your call the claimant 
wealth which he does not possess the partaker
 the illustrious blood douglas but which
vol i b
in his veins is sullied with illegitimacy paint
him the ruthless the daring the ambitious so
nigh greatness yet debarred from it so near
to wealth yet excluded from possessing it a
political tantalus ready to do or dare anything
to terminate his necessities and assert his imperfect
claims
admirable my dear croftangry but what
is a postulate 
pooh my dear madam you disturb the
current my ideas the postulate was in
scottish phrase the candidate for some benefice
which he had not yet attained george douglas
who stabbed rizzio was the postulate for
the temporal possessions the rich abbey 
arbroath
i stand informed come proceed who
comes next
who comes next yon tall thinmade 
man with the petronel in his hand
must be andrew er alongside a brother's
son i believe the celebrated sir david
er cessford his look and bearing those
 a border freebooter his disposition so savage
that during the fray in the cabinet he presented
his loaded piece at the bosom the young
and beautiful queen that queen also being
within a few weeks becoming a mother
bravo beau cousin well having raised
your bevy phantoms i hope you do not intend
to send them back to their cold beds to
warm them you will put them to some action
and since you do threaten the canongate with
your desperate quill you surely mean to novelist
or to dramatize if you will this most singular
 all tragedies 
worse that is less interesting periods 
history have been indeed shown up for furnishing
amusement to the peaceable ages which
have succeeded but dear lady the events are
too well known in mary's days to be used as
vehicles romantic fiction what can a better
writer than myself add to the elegant and forcible
narrative robertson so adieu to my
vision i awake like john bunyan and behold
it is a dream well enough that i awake
without a sciatica which would have probably
rewarded my slumbers had i profaned queen
mary's bed by using it as a mechanical resource
to awaken a torpid imagination
this will never do cousin answered mrs
baliol you must get over all these scruples if
you would thrive in the character a romantic
historian which you have determined to embrace
what is the classic robertson to you the
light which he carried was that a lamp to illuminate
the dark events antiquity yours is
a magic lantern to raise up wonders which never
existed no reader sense wonders at your
historical inaccuracies any more than he does
to see punch in the showbox seated on the
same throne with king solomon in his glory
or to hear him hallowing out to the patriarch
amid the deluge mighty hazy weather master
noah 
do not mistake me my dear madam said
i i am quite conscious my own immunities
as a taleteller but even the mendacious
mr fang assures us that though he never scruples
to tell a lie at his master's command yet it
hurts his conscience to be found out now
this is the reason why i avoid in prudence all
wellknown paths history where every one
can read the fingerposts carefully set up to advise
them the right turning and the very
boys and girls who learn the history britain
by way question and answer hoot at a poor
author if he abandons the highway
m do not be discouraged however cousin
chrystal there are plenty wildernesses in
scottish history through which unless i am
greatly misinformed no certain paths have
been laid down from actual survey but which
are only described by imperfect tradition which
fills up with wonders and with legends the periods
in which no real events are recognized to
have taken place even thus as mat prior
says 
geographers on pathless downs
place elephants for want towns 
if such be your advice my dear lady said
i the course my story shall take its rise
upon this occasion at a remote period history
and in a province removed from my natural
sphere the canongate
it was under the influence those feelings
that i undertook the following historical romance
which often suspended and flung aside
is now arrived at a size too important to be
altogether thrown away although there may belittle
prudence in sending it to the press
i have not placed in the mouth the characters
the lowland scotch dialect now spoken
because unquestionably the scottish that day
resembled very closely the anglosaxon with
a sprinkling french or norman to enrich it
those who wish to investigate the subject may
consult the chronicles wanton and the history
 bruce by archdeacon barbour but
supposing my own skill in the ancient scottish
were sufficient to invest the dialogue with its
peculiarities a translation must have been necessary
for the benefit the general reader
the scottish dialect may be therefore considered
as laid aside unless where the use peculiar
words may add emphasis or vivacity to the
composition
aunt valentine's bay 
the fair maid perth
chapter i
behold the tiber the vain roman cried
viewing the ample tay from beglie's side 
but where's the scot that would the vaunt repay
and hail the puny tiber for the tay 
among all the provinces in scotland if an
intelligent stranger were asked to describe the
most varied and the most beautiful it is probable
he would name the county perth a
native also any other district though his partialities
might lead him to prefer his native
county in the first instance would certainly
class that perth in the second and thus give
its inhabitants a fair right to plead that prejudice
apart perthshire forms the fairest portion
 caledonia it is long since lady mary
worsley montague with that excellent taste
which characterises her writings expressed her
opinion that the most interesting portion 
every country and that which exhibits the varied
beauties natural scenery in greatest perfection
is that where the mountains sink down
upon the champaign or more level land the
most picturesque if not the highest hills are to
be found there the rivers find their way out
 the mountainous region by the wildest leaps
and through the most romantic passes above
the vegetation a happier climate and soil is
mingled with the magnificent characteristics 
mountainscenery and woods groves and thickets
in profusion clothe the base the hills
ascend up the ravines and mingle with the precipices
it is in such favoured regions that the
traveller finds what the poet gray or some one
else has termed beauty lying in the lap 
terror
from the same advantage situation this
favoured province presents a variety the most
pleasing character its lakes woods and mountains
may vie in beauty with any that the highland
tour exhibits while perthshire contains
amidst this romantic scenery and in some places
in connexion with it many fertile and habitable
tracts which may vie with the richness merry
england herself the country has also been
the scene many remarkable exploits and events
some historical importance others interesting
to the poet and romancer though recorded
in popular tradition alone it was in these vales
that the saxons the plain and the gael the
mountains had many a desperate and bloody
encounter in which it was frequently impossible
to decide the palm victory between the
mailed chivalry the low country and the
plaided clans whom they opposed
perth so eminent for the beauty its situation
is a place great antiquity and old tradition
assigns to the town the importance a
roman foundation that victorious nation it
is said pretended to recognize the tiber in the
much more magnificent and navigable tay and
to acknowledge the large level space well known
by the name the north inch as having a near
resemblance to their campus martins the city
was often the residence our monarchs who
although they had no palace at perth found
the cistercian convent amply sufficient for the
reception their court it was here that james
the first one the wisest and best the
scottish kings fell a victim to the jealousy 
the vengeful aristocracy here also occurred
the mysterious conspiracy gowrie the scene
 which has only late been effaced by the
destruction the ancient palace in which the
tragedy was acted the antiquarian society 
perth with just zeal for the objects their
pursuit have published an accurate plan this
memorable mansion with some remarks upon
its connexion with the narrative the plot
which display equal acuteness and candour
one the most beautiful points view
which britain or perhaps the world can afford
is or rather we may say was the prospect from
a spot called the wicks beglie being a species
 niche at which the traveller arrived after
a long stage from kinross through a waste
and uninteresting country and from which as
forming a pass over the summit a ridgy eminence
which he had gradually surmounted he
beheld stretching beneath him the valley the
tay traversed by its ample and lordly stream 
the town perth with its two large meadows
or inches its steeples and its towers the hills 
moncrieff and kinnoul faintly rising into picturesque
rocks partly clothed with woods the rich
margin the river studded with elegant mansions
 and the distant view the huge grampian
mountains the northern screen this exquisite
landscape the alteration the road
greatly it must be owned to the improvement
 general intercourse avoids this magnificent
point view and the landscape is introduced
more gradually and partially to the eye though
the approach must be still considered as extremely
beautiful there is still we believe a footpath
left open by which the station at the wicks 
beglie may be approached and the traveller
by quitting his horse or equipage and walking
a few hundred yards may still compare the
real landscape with the sketch which we have
attempted to give but it is not in our power
to communicate or in his to receive the exquisite
charm which surprise gives to pleasure
when so splendid a view arises when least expected
or hoped for and which chrystal croftangry
experienced when he beheld for the first
time the matchless scene
childish wonder indeed was an ingredient
in my delight for i was not above fifteen years
old and as this had been the first excursion
which i was permitted to make on a pony my
own i also experienced the glow independence
mingled with that degree anxiety
which the most conceited boy feels when he is
first abandoned to his own undirected counsels
i recollect pulling up the reins without meaning
to do so and gazing on the scene before me as
if i had been afraid it would shift like those in a
theatre before i could distinctly observe its different
parts or convince myself that what i saw
was real since that hour and the period is
now more than fifty years past the recollection
 that inimitable landscape has possessed the
strongest influence over my mind and retained
its place as a memorable thing when much that
was influential on my own fortunes has fled
from my recollection it is therefore natural
that whilst deliberating on what might be
brought forward for the amusement the public
i should pitch upon some narrative connected
with the splendid scenery which made so
much impression on my youthful imagination
and which may perhaps have that effect in setting
off the imperfections the composition which
ladies suppose a fine set china to possess in
heightening the flavour indifferent tea
the period at which i propose to commence
is however considerably earlier than either 
the remarkable historical transactions to which
i have already alluded as the events which i
am about to recount occurred during the last
years the fourteenth century when the scottish
sceptre was swayed by the gentle but feeble
hand john who reigned under the title 
robert the third

chapter 
perth boasting as we have already mentioned
so large a portion the beauties inanimate
nature has at no time been without its
own share those charms which are at once
more interesting and more transient to be called
the fair maid perth would at any period
have been a high distinction and have inferred
no mean superiority in beauty where there
were many to claim that muchenvied attribute
but in the feudal times to which we now call
the reader's attention female beauty was a quality
 much higher importance than it has been
since the ideas chivalry have been in a great
measure extinguished the love the ancient
cavaliers was a licensed species idolatry
which the love heaven alone was theoretically
supposed to approach in intensity and which
in practice it seldom equalled god and the ladies
were familiarly appealed to in the same
breath and devotion to the fair sex was as peremptorily
enjoined upon the aspirant to the
honour chivalry as that which was due to
heaven at such a period in society the power
 beauty was almost unlimited it could level
the highest rank with that which was immeasurably
inferior
it was but in the reign preceding that 
robert iii that beauty alone had elevated a
person inferior rank and indifferent morals to
share the scottish throne and many women less
artful or less fortunate had risen to greatness
from a state concubinage for which the manners
 the times made allowance and apology
such views might have dazzled a girl higher
birth than catharine or katie glover who was
universally acknowledged to be the most beautiful
young woman the city or its vicinity and
whose renown as the fair maid perth had
drawn on her much notice from the young gallants
 the royal court when it chanced to be
residing in or near perth insomuch that more
than one nobleman the highest rank and most

distinguished for deeds chivalry were more
attentive to exhibit feats horsemanship as
they passed the door old simon glover in
what was called couvrefew or curfew street
than to distinguish themselves in the tournaments
where the noblest dames scotland
were spectators their address
but the glover's daughter for as was common
with citizens and artizans that early
period her father simon derived his sirname
from the trade which he practised showed
no inclination to listen to any gallantry which
came from those a station highly exalted
above that which she herself occupied and
though probably in no degree insensible to her
personal charms seemed desirous to confine her
conquests to those who were within her own
sphere life indeed her beauty being 
that kind which we connect more with the
mind than with the person was notwithstanding
her natural kindness and gentleness disposition
rather allied to reserve than to gaiety
even when in company with her equals 
vol i c
and the earnestness with which she attended
upon the exercises devotion induced many
to think that catharine glover nourished the
private wish to retire from the world and bury
herself in the recesses the cloister but to
such a sacrifice should it be meditated it was
not to be expected her father reputed a wealthy
man and having this only child would yield a
willing consent
in her resolution avoiding the addresses 
the gallant courtiers the reigning beauty 
perth was confirmed by the sentiments her
parent let them go he said let them go
catharine those gallants with their capering
horses their jingling spurs their plumed bonnets
and their trim moustaches they are not 
our class nor will we aim at pairing with them
tomorrow is saint valentine's day when
every bird chooses her mate but you will not
see the linnet pair with the sparrowhawk nor
the robin redbreast with the kite my father
was an honest burgher perth and could use
his needle as well as i can did there come
war to the gates our fair burgh down went
needles thread and shandy leather and out
came the good headpiece and target from the
dark nook and the long lance from above the
chimney show me a day that either he or i
were absent when the provost made his musters
 thus we have led our lives my girl
working to win our bread and fighting to defend
it i will have no soninlaw that thinks
himself better than me and for these lords and
knights i trust thou wilt always remember
thou art too low to be their lawful love and too
high to be their unlawful loon and now lay
by thy work lass for it is holytide eve and it
becomes us to go to the evening service and
pray that heaven may send thee a good valentine
tomorrow
so the fair maid perth laid aside the
splendid hawking glove which she was embroidering
for the lady drummond and putting on
her holiday kirtle prepared to attend her father
to the blackfriars monastery which was adjacent
to couvrefew street in which they lived
on their passage simon glover an ancient and
esteemed burgess perth somewhat stricken
in years and increased in substance received
from young and old the homage due to his velvet
jerkin and his gold chain while the beauty
 catharine though concealed beneath her
screen which resembled the mantilla still worn
in flanders called both obeisance and coffins
 the bonnet from young and old
as the pair moved on arm in arm they were
followed by a tall handsome young man dressed
in a yeoman's habit the plainest kind but
which showed to advantage his fine limbs as
the handsome countenance that looked out from
a quantity curled tresses surmounted by a
small scarlet bonnet became that species headdress
he had no other weapon than a staff in
his hand it not being thought fit that persons
 his degree for he was an apprentice to the
old glover should appear on the street armed
with sword or dagger a privilege which the jackmen
or military retainers the nobility esteemed
exclusively their own he attended his
master at holytide partly in the character a
domestic or protector should there be cause for
his interference but it was not difficult to discern
by the earnest attention which he paid to
catharine glover that it was to her rather than
to her father that he desired to dedicate his
good offices generally speaking there was no
opportunity for his zeal displaying itself for a
common feeling respect induced passengers
to give way to the father and daughter
but when the steel caps barrels and plumes
 squires archers and menatarms began to be
seen among the throng the wearers these warlike
distinctions were more rude in their demeanour
than the quiet citizens more than once
when from chance or perhaps from an assumption
 superior importance such an individual
took the wall simon in passing the glover's
youthful attendant bristled up with a look defiance
and the air one who sought to distinguish
his zeal in his mistress's service by its ardour
as frequently did conachar for such was
the lad's name receive a check from his master
who gave him to understand that he did not
wish his interference before he required it
foolish boy he said hast thou not lived
long enough in my shop to know that a blow
will breed a brawl that a dirk will cut the skin
as fast as a needle pierces leather that i love
peace though i never feared war and care not
which side the causeway my daughter and i
walk upon so we may keep our road in peace
and quietness conachar excused himself as
zealous for his master's honour yet was scarce
able to pacify the old citizen what have we
to do with honour said simon glover if
thou wouldst remain in my service thou must
think honesty and leave honour to the swaggering
fools who wear spurs at their heels and
iron on their shoulders if you wish to wear
and use such garniture you are welcome but it
shall not be in my house or in my company
conachar seemed rather to kindle at this rebuke
than to submit to it but a sign from catharine
if that slight raising her little finger
was indeed a sign had more effect than the
angry reproof his master and the youth
laid aside the military air which seemed natural
to him and relapsed into the humble follower
 a quiet burgher
meantime the little party were overtaken by
a tall young man wrapped in a cloak which obscured
or muffled a part his face a practice
often used by the gallants the time when
they did not wish to be known or were abroad
in quest adventures he seemed in short
one who might say to the world around him
u i desire for the present not to be known
or addressed in my own character but as i
am answerable to myself alone for my actions i
wear my incognito but for form's sake and care
little whether you see through it or not he
came on the right side catharine who had
hold her father's arm and slackened his pace
as if joining their party
good even to you goodman
the same to your worship and thanks 
may i pray you to pass on our pace is too slow
for that your lordship our company too
mean for that your father's son
my father's son can best judge that old
man i have business to talk with you and
with my fair st catharine here the loveliest
and most obdurate saint in the calendar
with deep reverence my lord said the
old man i would remind you that this is
good st valentine's eve which is no time for
business and that i can have your worshipful
commands by your serving man as early as it
pleases you to send them
there is no time like the present said the
persevering youth whose rank seemed to be 
a kind which set him above ceremony i wish
to know whether the buff doublet be finished
which i commissioned some time since 
and from you pretty catharine here he sank
his voice to a whisper i desire to be informed
whether your fair fingers have been employed
upon it agreeably to your promise but i need
not ask you for my poor heart has felt the pang
 each puncture that pierced the garment which
was to cover it traitress how wilt thou answer
for thus tormenting the heart that loves
thee so dearly 
let me entreat you my lord to forego this
wild talk it becomes not you to speak thus
or me to listen we are poor rank but honest
manners and the presence the father
ought to protect the child from such expressions
even from your lordship
this she spoke so low that neither her father
nor conachar could understand what she said
well tyrant answered the persevering
gallant i will plague you no longer now
providing you will let me see you from your
window tomorrow when the sun first peeps
over the eastern hill and give me right to be
your valentine for the year
not so my lord my father has but now
told me that hawks far less eagles pair not
with the humble linnet seek some court lady
to whom your favours will be honour to me 
your highness must permit me to speak the plain
truth they can be nothing but disgrace
as they spoke thus the party arrived at the
gate the church your lordship will i
trust permit us here to take leave you
said her father i am well aware how little
you will alter your pleasure for the pain and
uneasiness you may give to such as us but
from the throng attendants at the gate your
lordship may see that there are others in the
church to whom even your gracious lordship
must pay respect
yes respect and who pays any respect
to me said the haughty young lord a
miserable artizan and his daughter too much
honoured by my slightest notice have the insolence
to tell me that my notice dishonours them
well my princess doeskin and blue silk i
will teach you to rue this
as he murmured thus the glover and his
daughter entered the dominican church and
their attendant conachar in attempting to follow
them closely jostled perhaps not unwillingly
the young nobleman the gallant starting
from his unpleasing reverie and perhaps
considering this as an intentional insult seized
on the young man by the breast struck him
and threw dm from him his irritated opponent
recovered himself with difficulty and
grasped towards his own side as if seeking a
sword or dagger in the place where it was
usually worn but finding none he made a
gesture disappointed rage and entered the
church during the few seconds he remained
the young nobleman stood with his arms folded
on his breast with a haughty smile as if defying
him to do his worst when conachar
had entered the church his opponent adjusting
his cloak yet closer about his face made a
private signal by holding up one his gloves
he was instantly joined by two men who disguised
like himself had waited his motions at
a little distance they spoke together earnestly
after which the young nobleman retired in
one direction his friends or followers going off
in another
simon glover before he entered the church
cast a look towards the group but had taken
his place among the congregation before they
separated themselves he knelt down with the
air a man who has something burthensome on
his mind but when the service was ended he
seemed free from anxiety as one who had referred
himself and his troubles to the disposal
 heaven the ceremony high mass was
performed with considerable solemnity a number
 noblemen and ladies rank being present
preparations had indeed been made for
the reception the good old king himself but
some those infirmities to which he was subject
had prevented robert iii from attending the
service as was his wont when the congregation
were dismissed the glover and his beautiful
daughter lingered for some time for the
purpose making their several shifts in the
confessionals where the priests had taken their
places for discharging that part their duty
thus it happened that the night had fallen dark
and the way was solitary when they returned
along the now deserted streets to their own dwelling
most persons had betaken themselves to
home and to bed they who still lingered in the
street were nightwalkers or revellers the idle
and swaggering retainers the haughty nobles
who were much wont to insult the peaceful passengers
relying on the impunity which their
masters court favour was too apt to secure
them
it was perhaps in apprehension mischief
from some character this kind that conachar
stepping up to the glover said master walk
faster we are dogg'd
dogg'd mayest thou by whom and by
how man 
by one man muffled in his cloak who follows
us like our shadow
then will i never mend my pace along the
couvrefew street for the best one man that ever
trode it
 but he has arms said conachar
and so have we and hands and legs and
feet why sure conachar you are not afraid
 one man 
 afraid answered conachar indignant at
the insinuation you shall soon know if i am
afraid
 now you are as far on the other side the
mark thou foolish boy thy temper has no
middle course there is no occasion to make a
brawl though we do not run walk thou before
with catharine and i will take thy place we
cannot be exposed to danger so near home as
we are
the glover fell behind accordingly and certainly
observed a person keep so close to them
as the time and place considered justified some
suspicion when they crossed the street he
also crossed it and when they advanced or
slackened their pace the stranger's was in proportion
accelerated or diminished the matter
would have been very little consequence had
simon glover been alone but the beauty his
daughter might render her the object some
profligate scheme in a country where the laws
afforded such slight protection to those who had
not the means to defend themselves concha
and his fair charge having arrived on the
threshold their own apartment which was
opened to them by an old female servant the
burgher's uneasiness was ended determined
however to ascertain if possible whether there
had been any cause for it he called out to the
man whose motions had occasioned the alarm
and who stood still though he seemed to keep
out reach the light come step forward
my friend and do not play at bopeep 
knowest thou not that they who walk like
phantoms in the dark are apt to encounter the
conjuration a quarterstaff step forward i
say and show us thy shapes man
why so i can master glover said one 
the deepest voices that ever answered question
i can show shapes well enough only i wish
they could hear the light something better
body me exclaimed simon i should
know that voice and is it thou in thy bodily
person harry gow nay beshrew me if thou
passes this door with dry lips what man
curfew has not rung yet and if it had it were
no reason why it should part father and son
come in man dorothy shall get us something
to eat and we will jingle a can ere thou leave
us come in i say my daughter kate will
be right glad to see thee
by this time he had pulled the person whom
he welcomed so cordially into a sort kitchen
which served also upon ordinary occasions
the office parlour its ornaments were
trenchers pewter mixed with a silver cup
or two which in the highest degree cleanliness
ornamented a range shelves like those
 a beaufort popularly called the sink a
good fire with the assistance a blazing lamp
spread light and cheerfulness through the apartment
and a savoury smell some victuals
which dorothy was preparing did not at all
offend the unrefined noses those whose appetite
they were destined to satisfy
their unknown attendant now stood in full
light among them and though his appearance
was neither dignified nor handsome his face and
figure were not only deserving attention but
seemed in some manner to command it he was
rather below the middle stature but the breadth
 his shoulders length and frankness his
arms and the muscular appearance the whole
man argued a most unusual share strength
and a frame kept in vigour by constant exercise
his legs were somewhat bent but not in a manner
which could be said to approach to deformity 
on the contrary which seemed to correspond
to the strength his frame though it injured
in some degree its symmetry his dress was 
buffhide and he wore in a belt around his
waist a heavy broadsword and a dirk or poniard
as if to defend his purse which burgherfashion
was attached to the same cincture
the head was well proportioned round close
cropped and curled thickly with black hair
there was daring and resolution in the dark
eye but the other features seemed to express
a bashful timidity mingled with good humour
and obvious satisfaction at meeting with his old
friends abstracted from the bashful expression
which was that the moment the forehead
 henry gow or smith for he was indifferently
so called as both words equally indicated
his profession was high and noble
but the lower part the face was less happily
formed the mouth was large and wellfurnished
with a set firm and beautiful teeth the
appearance which corresponded with the air
 personal health and muscular strength which
the whole frame indicated a short thick beard
and moustaches which had lately been arranged
with some care completed the picture his
age could not exceed eightandtwenty
the family appeared all well pleased with
the unexpected appearance an old friend
simon glover shook his hand again and again
vol i u
dorothy made her compliments and catharine
herself offered freely her hand which henry
held in his massive grasp as if he designed to
carry it to his lips but after a moment's hesitation
desisted from fear lest the freedom might
be ill taken not that there was any resistance
on the part the little hand which lay passive
in his grasp but there was a smile mingled
with the blush on her cheek which seemed to
increase the confusion the gallant her father
on his part called out frankly as he saw
his friend's hesitation 
her lips man her lips and that's a proffer
i would not make to every one who crosses my
threshold but by good st valentine whose
holiday will dawn tomorrow i am so glad to
see thee in the bonny city pertly again that
it would be hard to tell the thing i could refuse
thee
the smith for as has been said such was
the craft this sturdy artizan was encouraged
modestly to salute the fair maid who yielded
the courtesy with a smile affection that might
have become a sister saying at the same time
let me hope that i welcome hack to perth a
repentant and amended man
he held her hand as if about to answer then
suddenly as one who lost courage at the moment
relinquished his grasp and drawing
back as if afraid what he had done his dark
countenance glowing with bashfulness mixed
with delight he sate down by the fire on the
opposite side from that which catharine occupied

come dorothy speed thee with the food
old woman and conachar where is conachar

he is gone to bed sir with a headach
said catharine in a hesitating voice
go call him dorothy said the old glover
 i will not be used thus by him his
highland blood forsooth is too gentle to lay a
trencher or spread a napkin and he expects to
enter our ancient and honourable craft without
duly waiting and tending upon his master and
teacher in all matters lawful obedience go
call him i say i will not be thus neglected
dorothy was presently heard screaming upstairs
or more probably up a ladder to the
cockloft to which the recusant apprentice had
made an untimely retreat a muttered answer
was returned and soon after conachar appeared
in the eating apartment there was a gloom
 deep sullenness on his haughty though handsome
features and as he proceeded to spread
the board and arrange the trenchers with salt
spices and other condiments to discharge in
short the duties a modern domestic which
the custom the time imposed upon all apprentices
 he was obviously disgusted and indignant
with the mean office imposed upon him
the fair maid perth looked with some anxiety
at him as if apprehensive that his evident
sullenness might increase her father's displeasure
 but it was not till her eyes had sought
out his for a second time that conachar condescended
to veil his dissatisfaction and throw
a greater appearance willingness and submission
into the services which he was performing

and here we must acquaint our reader that
though the private interchange looks betwixt
catharine glover and the young mountaineer
indicated some interest on the part the former
in the conduct the latter it would have
puzzled the strictest observer to discover whether
that feeling exceeded in degree what might
have been felt by a young person towards a
friend and inmate the same age with whom
she had lived on habits intimacy
thou hast had a long journey son henry
said glover who had always used that affectionate
style speech though noways akin to
the young artizan ay and hast seen many
a river besides tay and many a fair bigging
besides st johnston
but none that i like half so well and none
that are half so much worth my liking answered
the smith i promise you father
that when i crossed the wicks beglie and saw
the bonny city lie stretched fairly before me like
a fairy queen in romance whom the knight
finds asleep among a wilderness flowers i felt
even as a bird when it folds its wearied wings
to stoop down on its own nest
aha so thou canst play the maker yet
said the glover what shall we have our
ballets and our roundels again our lusty caold
scottish tor poet
rots for christmas and our mirthful springs to
trip it round the maypole 
such toys there may be forthcoming father
said henry smith though the blast 
the bellows and the clatter the anvil make
but coarse company to lays minstrelsy but
i can afford them no better since i must mend
my fortune though i mar my verses
right again my own son just answered
the glover and i trust thou has made a saving
voyage it 
nay i made a thriving one father i sold
the steel habergeon that you wot for four
hundred marks to the english warden the
east marches sir magnus median he scarce
scrupled a penny after i gave him leave to try
a sworddint upon it the beggarly highland
thief who bespoke it boggled at half the sum
though it had cost me a year's labour
what dost thou start at conachar said
simon addressing himself by way parenthesis
to the mountain disciple wilt thou
never learn to mind thy own business without
listening to what is passing round thee what
is it to thee that an englishman thinks that
cheap which a scotchman may hold dear 
conachar turned round to speak but after a
moment's consideration looked down and endeavoured
to recover his composure which had
been deranged by the contemptuous manner in
which the smith had spoken his highland
customers henry went on without paying any
attention to him
i sold at high prices seme swords and lingers
when i was at edinburgh they expect war
there and if it please god to send it my merchandize
will be worth its price st dunstan
make us thankful for he was our craft in
short this fellow laying his hand on his purse
who thou knowest father was somewhat lank
and low in condition when i set out four months
since is now as round and full as a sixweeks
porker
and that other leathernsheathed ironhinted
fellow who hangs beside him said the glover
 has he been idle all this while come
jolly smith confess the truth how many brawls
hast thou had since crossing the tay 
nay now you do me wrong father to
ask me such a question glancing a look at catharine
in such a presence answered the armourer
 i make swords indeed but i leave
it to other people to use them no no seldom
have i a naked sword in my fist save when i
am turning them on the anvil or grindstone 
and they slandered me to your daughter catharine
that led her to suspect the quietest burgess
in perth being a brawler i wish the best 
them would dare say such a word at the hill 
kinnoul and never a man on the green but he
and i
ay ay said the glover laughing we
should then have a fine sample your patient
sufferance out upon you henry that you will
speak so like a knave to one who knows thee so
well you look at kate too as if she did not
know that a man in this country must make his
hand keep his head unless he will sleep in slender
security come come beshrew me if thou
hast not spoiled as many suits armour as thou
hast made
why he would be a bad armourer father
simon that could not with his own blow make
proof his own workmanship if i did not
sometimes cleave a helmet or strike a sword's
point through a harness i should not know what
strength fabric to give them and might jingle
together such pasteboard work as yonder
edinburgh smiths think not shame to put out
 their hands
aha now would i lay a gold crown thou
hast had a quarrel with some edinburgh 
upon that very ground 
a quarrel no father replied the perth
armourer but a measuring swords with
such a one upon st leonard's crags for the honour
 my bonny city i confess surely you
do not think i would quarrel with a brother
craftsman 
ah to a surety no but how did your brother
craftsman come off
why as one with a sheet paper on his
bosom might come off from the stroke a lance
or rather indeed he came not off at all for
when i left him he was lying in the hermit's
lodge daily expecting death for which father
jervis said he was in heavenly preparation
well any more measuring weapons 
said the glover

chapter iii
the armourer's heart swelled big with various
and contending sensations so that it seemed
as if it would burst the leathern doublet under
which it was shrouded he arose turned
away his head and extended his hand towards
the glover while he averted his face as if desirous
that his emotion should not be read upon
his countenance
nay hang me if i bid you farewell man
said simon striking the flat his hand against
that which the armourer expanded towards him
i will shake no hands with you for an hour
to come at least tarry but a moment man
and i will explain all this and surely a few
drops blood from a scratch and a few silly
words from a foolish wench's lips are not to
part father and son when they have been so
long without meeting stay then man if ever
you would wish for a father's blessing and st
valentine's whose blessed eve this chances to
be
the glover was soon heard loudly summoning
dorothy and after some clanking 
keys and trampling up and down stairs dorothy
appeared bearing three large rummer cups
 green glass which were then esteemed a great
and precious curiosity and the glover followed
with a huge bottle equal at least to three quarts
 these degenerate days here is a cup 
wine henry older by half than i am myself
my father had it in a gift from stout old crabbe
the flemish engineer who defended perth so
stoutly in the minority david the second
we glovers could always do something in war
though our connexion with it was less than yours
who work in steel and iron and my father had
pleased old crabbe some other day i will tell
you how and also how long these bottles were
concealed under ground to save them from the
reiving southron so i will empty a cup to the
soul's health mv honoured father maw his
sins be forgiven him dorothy thou shalt drink
this pledge and then be gone to thy rockloft
i know thine ears are itching girl but i have
that to say which no one must hear save henry
smith the son mine adoption
dorothy did not venture to remonstrate but
taking off her glass or rather her goblet with
good courage retired to her sleeping apartment
according to her master's commands the two
friends were left alone
it grieves me friend henry said simon
filling at the same time his own glass and his
guest's it grieves me from my soul that my
daughter retains this silly humour but alsome
thinks thou nights mend it why wouldst
thou come hither clattering with thy sword and
dagger when the girl is so silly that she cannot
bear the sight these dost thou not remember
that thou hadst a sort quarrel with her
even before thy last departure from perth because
thou wouldst not go like other honest quiet
burghers but must be ever armed like one 
the rascally jackie that wait on the nobility
sure it is time enough for decent burgesses to
arm at the tolling the common bell which
calls us out odin in effeir war
why my good father that was not my
fault but i had no sooner quitted my nag than
i run hither to tell you my return thinking
if it were your will to permit me that i would
get your advice about being mistress catharine's
valentine for the year and then i heard from
mrs dorothy that you were gone to hear mass at
the black friars so i thought i would follow
thither partly to hear the same mass with you
and partly our lady and st valentine forgive
me to look upon one who thinks little enough
 me and as you entered the church methought
i saw two or three dangerouslooking
men holding counsel together and gazing at
you and at her and in especial sir john ramorn
whom i knew well enough for all his
disguise and the velvet patch over his eye and
that is not in dread war but in the guise which cjf'eirs
or belongs to war in arms namely offensive and defensive m bodin
in fear war a frequent term in old scottish history and
muniments means arrayed in warlike guise
his cloak so like a serving man's methought
father simon that as you were old and yonder
slip a highlander something too young to do
battle i would even walk quietly after you not
doubting with the tools i had about me to bring
any one to reason that might disturb you in
your way home you know that yourself discovered
me and drew me into the house whether
i would or no otherwise i promise you
i would not have seen your daughter till i had
donned the new jerkin which was made at berwick
after the latest cut nor would i have appeared
before her with these weapons which she
dislikes so much although to say truth so
many are at deadly feud with me for one unhappy
chance or another that it is as needful
for me as for any man in scotland to go by
night with weapons about me
the silly wench never thinks that said
simon glover she never has sense to consider
that in our dear native land scotland
every man deems it his privilege and duty to
avenge his own wrong but harry my boy
thou art to blame for taking her talk so much
to heart i have seen thee bold enough with
other wenches wherefore so still and tonguetied
with her 
because she is something different from
other maidens father glover because she is
not only more beautiful but wiser higher holier
and seems to me as if she were made better
clay than we that approach her i can hold
my head high enough with the rest the lasses
round the maypole but somehow when i approach
catharine i feel myself an earthly
coarse ferocious creature scarce worthy to look
on her much less to contradict the precepts
which she expounds to me
il you are an imprudent merchant harry
smith replied simon and rate too high
the goods you wish to purchase catharine is
a good girl and my daughter but if you make
her a conceited ape by your bashfulness and your
flattery neither you nor i will see our wishes
accomplished
i i often fear it my good father said the
smith for i feel how little i am deserving 
catharine
vol i
feel a thread's said the glover
feel for me friend smith for catharine and
me think how the poor thing is beset from
morning to night and by what sort persons
even though windows be down and doors shut
we were accosted today by one too powerful
to be named ay and he showed his displeasure
openly because i would not permit him
to gallant my daughter in the church itself
when the priest was saying mass there are
others scarce less reasonable i sometimes wish
that catharine were some degrees less fair that
she might not catch that dangerous sort admiration
or somewhat less holy that she might
sit down like an honest woman contented with
stout henry smith who could protect his wife
against every sprig chivalry in the court 
scotland
and if i did not said henry thrusting out
a hand and arm which might have belonged to
a giant for bone and muscle i would i may
never bring hammer upon anvil again ay
an it were come but that length my fair catharine
should see that there is no harm in a man
having the trick defence but i believe she
thinks the whole world is one great minsterchurch
and that all who live in it should behave
as if they were at an eternal mass
nay in truth said the father she has
strange influence over those who approach her 
the highland lad conachar with whom i have
been troubled for these two or three years although
you may see he has the natural spirit 
his people obeys the least sign which catharine
makes him and indeed will hardly be
ruled by any one else in the house she takes
much pains with him to bring him from his rude
highland habits
here harry smith became uneasy in his chair
lifted the flaggon set it down and at length exclaimed
 the devil take the young highland
whelp and his whole kindred what has catharine
to do to instruct such a fellow as he 
he will be just like the wolfcub that i was fool
enough to train to the offices a dog and everyone
thought him reclaimed till in an ill hour
i went to walk on the hill moncrieff when
he broke loose on the laird's flock and made
a havock that i might well have rued had the
laird not wanted harness at the time and i
marvel that you being a sensible man father
glover will keep this highland young fellow
a likely one i promise you so nigh to catharine
as if there were no other than your daughter
to serve him for a schoolmistress
fie my son fie now you are jealous
said simon a poor young fellow who to
tell you the truth resides here because he may
not so well live on the other side the hill
ay ay father simon retorted the smith
who had all the narrowminded feelings the
burghers his time an it were not for fear
 offence i would say that you have even too
much packing and peeling with yonder loons
out burgh
i must get my deerhides kidskins and
so forth somewhere my good harry and
highlandmen give good bargains
they can afford them replied henry
drily for they sell nothing but stolen gear
well well be that as it may it is not my
business where they get the bestial so i get
the hides but as i was saying there are certain
considerations why i am willing to oblige
the father this young man by keeping him
here and he is but half a highlander neither
and wants a thought the dour spirit a
glueamie after all i have seldom seen him
so fierce as he showed himself but now
you could not unless he had killed his
man replied the smith in the same dry tone
nevertheless if you wish it harry i'll set
all other respects aside and send the landholder
to seek other quarters tomorrow morning
nay father said the smith you cannot
suppose that harry gow cares the value a
smithydander for such a cub as yonder catmountain
 i care little i promise you though all
his clan were coming down the shoe gate with
slogan crying and pipes playing i would find
fifty blades and bucklers would send them back
faster than they came but to speak truth
though it is a fool's speech too i care not to
see the fellow so much with catharine res
cinder
member lather glover your trade keeps your
eyes and hands close employed and must have
your heedful care even if this lazy lurdane
wrought at it which you know yourself he seldom
does
and that is true said simon he cuts
all his gloves out for the right hand and never
could finish a pair in his life
no doubt his notions skincutting are
rather different said henry but with your
leave father i would only say that work he
or be he idle he has no bleared eyes no hands
seared with the hot iron and walked by the
use the forehammer no hair rusted in the
smoke and singed in the furnace like the hide
 a badger rather than what is fit to be covered
with a christian bonnet now let catharine
be as good a wench as ever lived and i will uphold
her to be the best in perth yet she must
see and know that these things make a difference
betwixt man and man and that the difference
is not in my favour
here is to thee with all my heart son
harry said the old man filling a brimmer to
hi companion and another to himself u i see
that good smith as thou art thou keenest not
the mettle that women are made thou must
be bold henry and bear thyself not as if thou
wert going to the gallowlee but like a gay young
fellow who knows his own worth and will not
be slighted by the best grandchild eve ever
had catharine is a woman like her mother
and thou thickest foolishly to suppose they are
all set on what pleases the eye their ear must
be pleased too man they must know that he
whom they favour is bold and buxom and
might have the love twenty though he is
seeing for theirs believe an old man women
walk more by what others think than by what
they think themselves and when she asks for
the boldest man in perth whom shall she hear
named but harry burnthewind the best
armourer that ever fashioned weapon on anvil 
why harry smith again the tightest dancer
at the maypole why the lusty smith the
gayest troller ballads why who but harry
gow the best wrestler swordandbuckler
player the king the weaponshowing the
breaker mud horses the tamer wild highlander
 ever more it is thee thee no one
but thee and shall catharine prefer yonder
slip a highland boy to thee pshaw she
might as well make a steel gauntlet out kid's
leather i tell thee conachar is nothing to
her but so far as she would fain prevent the
devil having his due him as other highlander
 god bless her poor thing she would
bring all mankind to better thoughts if she
could
m in which she will fail to a certainty said
the smith who as the reader may have noticed
had no good will to the highland race
i will wager on old nick whom i should
know something he being indeed a worker in
the same element with myself against catharine
on that debate the devil will have the
tartan that is sure enough
ay but catharine replied the glover
hath a second thou knowest little father
clement has taken the young reiver in
hand and he fears a hundred devils as little
as i do a flock geese
 father clement said the smith you
are always making some new saint in this godly
city saint johnston pray who for a
devil's drubber may he be one your hermits
that is trained for the work like a wrestler
for the ring and brings himself to trim by fasting
and penance is he not 
no that is the marvel it said simon 
father clement eats drinks and lives much
like other folks all the rules the church
nevertheless strictly observed
oh i comprehend a buxom priest that
thinks more good living than good lifetipple
a can on eastern's eve to enable him to
face lent has a pleasant in principio and
confesses all the prettiest women about town 
you are on the bowhand still smith i
tell you my daughter and i could nose out either
a fasting hypocrite or a full one but father
clement is neither the one nor the other
but what is he then in heaven's name 
one who is either greatly better than half
his brethren saint johnston put together
or so much worse than the worst them that
it is sin and shame that he is suffered to abide
in the country
methinks it were easy to tell whether hebe
the one or the other said the smith
content you my friend said simon
with knowing that if you judge father clement
by what you see him do and hear him say
you will think him as the best and kindest
man in the world with a comfort for every
man's grief a counsel for every man's difficulty
the rich man's surest guide and the poor man's
best friend but if you listen to what the dominicans
say him he is benedicite here
the glover crossed himself on brow and bosom 
a foul heretic who ought by means earthly
flames to be sent to those which burn eternally

the smith also crossed himself and exclaimed
 saint mary father simon and do you
who are so good and prudent that you have
been called the wise glover perth let your
daughter attend the ministry one who the
saints preserve us may be in league with the
foul fiend himself why was it not a priest
who raised the devil in the meal vermes when
hodge jackson's house was blown down in the
great wind did not the devil appear in the
midst the tay dressed in a priest's scapular
gambolling like a peach amongst the waves
the morning when our stately bridge was swept
away 
i cannot tell whether he did or no said
the glover i only know i saw him not as
to catharine she cannot be said to use father
clement's ministry seeing her confessor is old
father francis the dominican from whom she
had her shrift today but women will sometimes
be wilful and sure enough she consults
with father clement more than i could wish 
and yet when i have spoken with him myself
i have thought him so good and holy a man
that i could have trusted my own salvation with
him there are bad reports him among the
dominicans that is certain but what have we
laymen to do with such things my son let us
pay mother church her dues give our alms
confess and do our penances duly and the
saints will bear us out
ay truly and they will have consideration
 said the smith for any rash and unhappy
blow that a man may deal in a fight
when his party was on defence and standing
up to him and that's the only creed a man
can live upon in scotland let your daughter
think what she pleases marry a man must
know his fence or have a short lease his life
in any place where blows are going so rife five
nobles to our altar have cleared me for the best
man i ever had misfortune with
let us finish our flask then said the old
glover for i reckon the dominican tower is
tolling midnight and hark thee son henry beat
the lattice win do won our eastgableby the very
peep dawn and make me aware thou art come
by whistling the smith's call gently i will contrive
that catharine shall look out at the window
and thus thou wilt have all the privileges
 being a gallant valentine through the rest 
the year which if thou canst not use to thine
own advantage i shall be led to think that for
all thou best covered with the lion's hide nature
has left on thee the long ears the ass
amen father said the armourer a
hearty good night to you and god's blessing
on your rooftree and those whom it covers
you shall hear the smith's call sound by cockcrowing
i warrant i put sir chanticleer to
shame
so saying he took his leave and though
completely undaunted moved through the deserted
streets like one upon his guard to his
own dwelling which was situated in the mill
wynd at the western perth
chapter 
the sturdy armourer was not it may be
believed slack in keeping the appointment assigned
by his intended fatherinlaw he went
through the process his toilette with more
than ordinary care throwing as far as he could
those points which had a military air into the
shade he was far too noted a person to venture
to go entirely unarmed in a town where
he had indeed many friends but also from the
character many his former exploits several
deadly enemies at whose hands should they
take him at advantage he knew he had little
mercy to expect he therefore wore under
his jerkin a secret or coat chainmail made
so light and flexible that it interfered as little
with his movements as a modern underwaistcoat
yet such proof as he might safely depend
upon every ring it having been wrought
and joined by his own hands above this he
wore like others his age and degree the
flemish hose and doublet which in honour 
the holy tide were the best superfine english
broad cloth light blue in colour slashed outwith
black satin and passamented laced that
is with embroidery black silk his walking
boots were cordovan leather his cloak 
good scottish grey which served to conceal a
whinger or couteau de chasse that hung at his
belt and was his only offensive weapon for he
carried in his hand but a rod holly his
black velvet bonnet was lined with steel quilted
between the metal and his head and thus
constituted a means defence which might
safely be trusted to
upon the whole henry had the appearance
to which he was well entitled a burgher
 wealth and consideration assuming in
his dress as much consequence as he could
display without stepping beyond his own rank
and encroaching on that the gentry neither
did his frank and manly deportment though
indicating a total indifference to danger bear the
least resemblance to that the bravoes or swashbucklers
 the dav amongst whom henry was
sometimes unjustly ranked by those who imputed
the frays in which he was so often engaged
to a quarrelsome and violent temper resting
upon a consciousness his personal strength
and knowledge his weapon on the contrary
every feature bore the easy and goodhumoured
expression one who neither thought
 inflicting mischief nor dreaded it from others
baying attired himself in his best the honest
armourer next placed nearest to his heart
which throbbed at its touch j a little gift
which he had long provided for catharine
glover and which his quality valentine
would presently give him the title to present
and her to receive without regard to maidenly
scruples it was a small ruby cut into the
form a heart transfixed with a golden arrow
and was inclosed in a small purse made
 links the finest work in steel as if it had
been designed for a hauberk to a king round
the verge the puree were these words 
cleave hearts
this device had cost the armourer some
thought and he was much satisfied with his composition
because it seemed to imply that his
skill could defend all hearts saving his own
he wrapped himself in his cloak and hastened
through the still silent streets determined to
appear at the window appointed a little before
dawn
with this purpose he passed up the high
street and turned down the opening where
saint john's church now stands in order to
proceed to curfew street when it occurred to
him from the appearance the sky that he
was at least an hour too early for his purpose
and that it would be better not to appear at the
place rendezvous till near the time assigned
other gallants were not unlikely to be on the
watch as well as himself about the house o the
fair maid perth and he knew his own foible
eat thane
i g
s
a souffle arising betwixt them i have the advantage
he thought by my father simon's
friendship and why should i stain my fingers
with the blood the poor creatures that are not
worthy my notice since they are so much less
fortunate than myself no no i will be wise
for once and keep at a distance from all temptation
to a broil they shall have no more time
to quarrel with me than just what it may require
for me to give the signal and for my father
simon to answer it i wonder how the old
man will contrive to bring her to the window 
i fear if she knew his purpose he would find
it difficult to carry it into execution
while these loverlike thoughts were passing
through his brain the armourer loitered in his
pace often turning his eyes eastward and eying
the firmament in which no slight shades 
grey were beginning to flicker to announce
the approach dawn however distant which
to the impatience the stout armourer seemed
on that morning to abstain longer than
usual from occupying her eastern barbican he
was now passing slowly under the wall saint
anne's chapel not failing to cross himself and
say an are as he trode the consecrated ground
when a voice which seemed to come from behind
one the flying buttresses the chapel
said he lingers that has need to run
who speaks said the armourer looking
around him somewhat startled at an address so
unexpected both in its tone and tenor
u no matter who speaks answered the same
voice do thou make great speed or thou
wilt scarce make good speed bandy not words
but begone
saint or sinner angel or devil said henry
crossing himself your advice touches me
but too dearly to be neglected saint valentine
be my speed 
so saying he instantly changed his loitering
pace to one with which few people could have
kept up and in an instant was in couvrefew
street he had not made three steps towards
simon glover's which stood in the midst 
the narrow street when two men started from
under the houses on different sides and advanced
as it were by concert to intercept his passage
the imperfect light only permitted him to
discern that they wore the highland mantle
clear the way cathedral said the armourer
in the deep stern voice which corresponded
with the breadth his chest
they did not answer at least intelligibly
but he could see that they drew their swords
with the purpose withstanding him by violence
conjecturing some evil but what
kind he could not anticipate henry instantly
determined to make his way through whatever
odds and defend his mistress or at least
die at her feet he cast his cloak over his
left arm as a buckler and advanced rapidly and
steadily to the two men the nearest made a thrust
at him but henry smith parrying the blow with
his cloak dashed his arm in the man's face and
tripping him at the same time gave him a severe
fall on the causeway while almost at the same
instant he struck a blow with his linger at the
fellow who was upon his right hand so severely
applied that he also lay prostrate by his associate
meanwhile the armourer pushed forward
in alarm for which the circumstances 
the street being guarded or defended by strangers
who conducted themselves with such violence
afforded sufficient reason he heard a suppressed
whisper and a bustle under the glover's
windows those very windows from which he
had expected to be hailed by catharine as her
valentine he kept to the opposite side the
street that he might reconnoitre their number
and purpose but one the party who were
beneath the window observing or hearing him
crossed the street also and taking him doubtless
for one the sentinels asked in a whisper
 what noise was yonder kenneth why
gave you not the signal 
villain said henry you are discovered
and you shall die the death 
as he spoke thus he dealt the stranger a
blow with his weapon which would probably
have made his words good had not the man
raising his arm received on his hand the blow
meant for his head the wound must have been
a severe one for he staggered and fell with a
deep groan without noticing him farther henry
smith sprung forward upon a party men
who seemed engaged in placing a ladder against
the lattice window in the gable henry did not
stop either to count their numbers or to ascertain
their purpose but crying the alarmword
 the town and giving the signal at which the
burghers were wont to collect he rushed on the
night walkers one whom was in the act 
ascending the ladder the smith seized it by
the rounds threw it down on the pavement and
placing his foot on the body the man who had
been mounting prevented him from regaining
his feet his accomplices struck fiercely at
henry to extricate their companion but his
mailcoat stood him in good stead and he repaid
their blows with interest shouting aloud
help help for bonnie st johnston bows
and blades brave citizens bows and blades 
they break into our houses under cloud 
night
these words which resounded far through
the streets were accompanied by as many fierce
blows dealt with good effect among those whom
the armourer assailed in the meantime the
inhabitants the street began to awaken and
appear on the street iu their shirts with swords
and targets and some them with torches
the assailants now endeavoured to make their
escape which all them effected excepting the
man who had been thrown down along with the
ladder him the intrepid armourer had caught
by the throat in the scuffle and held as fast
as the greyhound holds the hare the other
wounded men were borne ois by their comrades

here are a sort knaves breaking peace
within burgh said henry to the neighbours
who began to assemble make after the rogues
they cannot all get off for i have maimed some
 them the blood will guide you to them
some highland catherine said the citizens
 up and chase neighbours 
ay chase chase leave me to manage
this fellow continued the armourer
the assistants dispersed in different directions
their lights flashing and their cries resounding
through the whole adjacent district
in the meantime the armourer's captive entreated
for freedom using both promises and
throats to obtain it as thou art a gentleman
he said let me go and what is past
shall be forgiven
i am no gentleman said henry i am
hal the wynd a burgess perth and i
have done nothing to need forgiveness
villain thou hast done thou knowest not
what but let me go and i will fill thy bonnet
with gold pieces
i shall fill thy bonnet with a cloven head
presently said the armourer unless thou
stand still as a true prisoner
what is the matter my son harry said
simon who now appeared at the window i
hear thy voice in another tone than i expected 
what is all this noise and why are the neighbours
gathering to the affray 
there have been a proper set glimmers
about to scale your windows father simon 
but i am like to prove godfather to one them
whom i hold here as fast as ever vice held
iron
hear me simon glover said the prisoner
 let me but speak one word with you iu
private and rescue me from the gripe this
ironfisted and leadenpated clown and i will
show thee that no harm was designed to thee
or thine and moreover tell thee what will
much advantage thee
i should know that voice said simon
glover who now came to the door with a darklantern
in his hand son smith let this
young man speak with me there is no danger
in him i promise you stay hut an instant
where you are and let no one enter the house
either to attack or defend i will be answerable
that this galliard meant but some saint
valentine's jest
so saying the old man pulled in the prisoner
and shut the door leaving henry a little surprised
at the unexpected light in which his 
had viewed the affray a jest 
he said it might have been a strange jest
if they had got into the maiden's sleeping
room and they would have done so had it
not been for the honest friendly voice from betwixt
the buttresses which if it were not that 
the blessed saint though what am i that the
holy person should speak to me could not
sound in that place without her permission and
assent and for which i will promise her a wax
candle at her shrine as long as my linger 
and i would i had had my twohanded broadsword
in stead both for the sake st johnston
and the rogues for a certain those lingers
are pretty toys but more fit for a boy's hand
than a man's oh my old twohanded trojan
hadst thou been in my hands as thou hengist
presently at the tester my bed the legs 
those rogues had not carried their bodies so clean
off the field but there come lighted torches
and drawn swords so ho stand are you
for st johnston if friends to the bonnie
burgh you are well come
we have been but bootless hunters said
the townsmen we followed by the tracks 
the blood into the dominican burialground
and we started two fellows from amongst the
tombs supporting betwixt them a third who
had probably got some your marks about him
harry they got to the postern gate before we
could overtake them and rang the sanctuary
bell the gate opened and in went they so
they are safe in girth and sanctuary and we
may go to our cold beds and warm us
ay said one the party the good
dominicans have always some devout brother
 their convent sitting up to open the gate 
the sanctuary to any poor soul that is in trouble
and desires shelter in the church
yes if the poor hunted soul can pay for it
said another but truly if he be poor in purse
as well as in spirit he may stand on the outside
till the hounds come up with him
a third who had been poring for a few minutes
upon the ground by advantage his torch
now looked upwards and spoke he was a
brisk forward rather corpulent little man called
oliver proudfute reasonably wealthy and
a leading man in his craft which was that 
bonnetmakers he therefore spoke as one in
authority canst tell us jolly smith for
they recognised each other by the lights which
were brought into the streets what manner
 fellows they were who raised up this fray
within burgh 
the two that i first saw answered the
armourer seemed to me as well as i could
observe them to have highland plaids about
them
like enough like enough answered the
citizen shaking his head it's a shame the
breaches in our walls are not repaired and that
these landlouping highland scoundrels are left
at liberty to take honest men and women out 
their beds any night that is dark enough
but look here neighbours said oliver
proudfute showing a bloody hand which he
had picked up from the ground when did such
a hand as this tie a highlands's brogues it
is large indeed and bony but as fine as a
lady's with a ring that sparkles like a gleaming
candle simon glover has made gloves for
this hand before now if i am not much mistaken
for he works for all the courtiers the
spectators here began to gaze on the bloody token
with various comments
if that is the case said one harry smith
had best show a clean pair heels for it
since the justiciar will scarce think the protecting
a burgess's bouse an excuse for cutting
off a gentleman's band there be hard laws
against mutilation
fie upon you that you will say so michael
webster answered the bonnetmaker are
we not representatives and successors the
stout old romans who built perth as like to their
own city as they could and have we not charters
from all our noble kings and progenitors
as being their loving liegemen and would you
have us now yield up our rights privileges and
immunities our outran and infant our handhabet
our backbearing and our bloodsuits
and amerciaments escheats and commodities
and suffer an honest burgess's house to be assaulted
without seeking for redress no brave
citizens craftsmen and burgesses the tay shall
flow back to ducked before we submit to such
injustice 
and how can we help it said a grave old
man who stood leaning on a twohanded sword 
what would you have us do 
marry bailie craigdallie i wonder that
you all men ask the question i would have
you pass like true men from this very place to
the king's grace's presence raise him from his
royal rest and presenting to him the piteous
case our being called forth from our beds at
this season with little better covering than these
shirts i would show him this bloody token and
know from his grace's own royal lips whether
it is just and honest that his loving lieges should
be thus treated by the knights and nobles his
deposed court and this i call pushing our
cause warmly
warmly sayst thou replied the old burgess
 why so warmly that we shall all die 
cold man before the porter turn a key to let
us into the royal presence come friends the
night is bitter we have kept our watch and
ward like men and our jolly smith hath given a
warning to those that would wrong us which
shall be worth twenty proclamations the
king tomorrow is a new day we will consult
on this matter on this selfsame spot and
consider what measures should be taken for
discovery and pursuit the villains and therefore
let us dismiss before the heart'sblood freeze
ill
bravo bravo neighbour craigdallie st
johnston for ever v
oliver proudfute would still have spoken for
he was one those pitiless orators who think
that their eloquence can overcome all inconveniences
in time place and circumstances but
no one would listen and the citizens dispersed
to their own houses by the light the dawn
which began now to streak the horizon
they were scarce gone ere the door glover's
house opened and seizing the smith by the
hand the old man pulled him in
where is the prisoner demanded the armourer

he is gone escaped fled what do i
know him said the glover he got out
at the back door and so through the little garden
 think not him but come and see the
valentine whose honour and life you have saved
this morning
let me but sheathe my weapon said the
smith let me but wash my hands
there is not an instant to lose she is up
and almost dressed come on man she shall
see thee with thy good weapon in thy hand and
with villain's blood on thy fingers that she may
know what is the value a true man's service
she has stopped my mouth over long with her
pruderies and her scruples i will have her
know what a brave man's love is worth and a
bold burgess's to boot
chapter 
startled from her repose by the noise 
the affray the fair maid perth had listened
in breathless terror to the sounds violence
and outcry which arose from the street she
had sunk on her knees to pray for assistance
and when she distinguished the voices neighbours
and friends collected for her protection
she remained in the same posture to return
thanks she was still kneeling when her father
almost thrust her champion henry smith
into her apartment the bashful lover hanging
back at first as if afraid to give offence
and on observing her posture from respect to
her devotion
father said the armourer she prays 
vol i k
i dare no more speak to her than to a bishop
when he says mass
now go thy ways for a right valiant and
courageous blockhead said her father and
then speaking to his daughter he added 
heaven is best thanked my daughter by
gratitude shown to our fellowcreatures here
comes the instrument by whom god has rescued
thee from death or perhaps from dishonour
worse than death receive him catharine as
thy true valentine and him whom i desire to
see my affectionate son
not thus father replied catharine i
can see can speak to no one now i am not
ungrateful perhaps i am too thankful to the
instrument our safety but let me thank the
guardian saint who sent me this timely relief
and give me but a moment to don my kirtle
nay godmercy wench it were hard
to deny thee time to busk thy bodyclothes since
the request is the only words like a woman that
thou hast uttered for these ten days truly
son harry i would my daughter would put off
being entirely a saint till the time comes for
her being canonized for st catharine the second

nay jest not father for i will swear she
has at least one sincere adorer already who
hath devoted himself to her pleasure so far as
sinful man may faretheewell then for the
moment fair maiden he concluded raising
his voice u and heaven send thee dreams as
peaceful as thy waking thoughts i go to watch
thy slumbers and woe with him that shall intrude
on them 
nay good and brave henry whose warm
heart is at such variance with thy reckless hand
thrust thyself into no farther quarrels tonight 
but take the kindest thanks and with these
try to assume the peaceful thoughts which you
assign to me tomorrow we will meet that
i may assure you my gratitude farewell
and farewell lady and light my heart 
said the armourer and descending the stair
which led to catharine's apartment was about
to sally forth into the street when the glover
caught him by the arm
i shall like the ruffle tonight said he
better than i ever thought to do the clashing
 steel if it brings my daughter to her senses
harry and teaches her what thou art worth
by st macgrider i even love these restorers
and am sorry for that poor lover who will never
wear lefthanded chevron again ay he
has lost that which he will miss all the days 
his life especially when he goes to pull on his
gloves ay he will pay but half a fee to my
craft in future nay not a step from this
house tonight he continued h thou dost
not leave us i promise thee my son
i do not mean it but i will with your
permission watch in the street the attack
may be renewed
and if it be said simon thou wilt have
better access to drive them back having the
vantage the house it is the way fighting
which suits us burghers best that resisting
from behind stone walls our duty watch
and ward teaches us that trick besides enough
are awake and astir to ensure us peace and quiet
till morning so come in this way
so saying he drew henry nothing loath
into the same apartment where they had supped
and where the old woman who was on foot
disturbed as others had been by the nocturnal
affray soon roused up the fire
and now my doughty son said the glover
 what liquor wilt thou pledge thy father
in
henry smith had suffered himself to sink
mechanically upon a seat old black oak and
now gazed on the fire that flashed back a ruddy
light over his manly features he muttered to
himself half audibly good henry brave
henry ah had she but said dear henry 
what liquors be these said the old glover
laughing my cellar holds none such 
but if sack or rhenish or wine gascony
can serve why say the word and the flagon
foams that is all
the kindest thanks said the armourer
still musing that's more than she ever said
to me before the kindest thanks what may
not that stretch to 
it shall stretch like kid's leather man
said the glover if thou wilt but be ruled
and say what thou wilt take for thy morning's
draught
whatever thou wilt father answered the
armourer carelessly and relapsed into the analysis
 catharine's speech to him she spoke
 my warm heart but she also spoke my
reckless hand what earthly thing can i do
to get rid that fighting fancy certainly
i were best strike my right hand off and nail
it to the door a church that it may never dome
discredit more
you have chopped off hands enough for one
night said his friend setting a flagon wine
on the table why dost thou vex thyself
man she would love thee twice as well did
she not see how thou contest upon her but it
becomes serious now i am not to have the
risk my booth being broken and my house
plundered by the hellraking followers the
nobles because she is called the fair maid 
perth and please ye no she shall know i am
her father and will have that obedience to which
law and gospel give me right i will have her
thy wife henry my heart gold thy wife
my man metal and that before many weeks
are over come come here is to thy merry
bridal jolly smith
the father quaffed a large cup and filled it
to his adopted son who raised it slowly to his
head then ere it had reached his lips replaced
it suddenly on the table and shook his head
nay if thou wilt not pledge me to such a
health i know no one who will said simon
what canst thou mean thou foolish lad here
has a chance happened which in a manner places
her in thy power since from one the city
to the other all would cry fie on her if she should
say thee nay here am i her father not only
consenting to the cutting out the match but
willing to see you two as closely united together
as ever needle stitched buckskin r and with all
this on thy side fortune father and all thou
loosest like a distracted lover in a ballad more
like to pitch thyself into the tay than to woo
a lass that may be had for the asking if you
can but choose the lucky minute
ay but that lucky minute father i question
much if catharine ever has such a moment
to glance on earth and its inhabitants as might
lead her to listen to a coarse ignorant borrel
man like me i cannot tell how it is father 
elsewhere i can hold up my head like another
man but with your saintly daughter i lose heart
and courage and i cannot help thinking that it
would be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if i
could succeed in surprising her affections her
thoughts are too much fitted for heaven to be
wasted on such a one as i am
e'en as you like henry answered the
glover my daughter is not courting you anymore
than i am a fair offer is no cause feud 
only if you think that i will give into her foolish
notions a convent take it with you that
i will never listen to them i love and honour
the church he said crossing himself i pay
her rights duly and cheerfully tithes and alms
wine and wax i pay them as justly i say as
any man in perth my means doth but i cannot
afford the church my only and single ewelamb
that i have in the world her mother
was dear to me on earth and is now an angel
in heaven catharine is all i have to remind
me her i have lost and if she goes to the
cloister it shall be when these old eyes are
closed for ever and not sooner but as for
you friend gow i pray you will act according
to your own best liking i want to force no
wife on you i promise you
nay now you beat the iron twice over
said henry it is thus we always father
by your being testy with me for not doing
that thing in the world which would make
me happiest were i to have it in my power
why father i would the keenest dirk i ever
forged were sticking in my heart at this moment
if there is one single particle in it that is not
more your daughter's property than my own
but what can i do i cannot think less her
or more myself than we both deserve and
what seems to you so easy and certain is to meas
difficult as it would be to work a steel hauberk
out hards flax but here is to you
father he added in a more cheerful tone 
and here is to my fair saint and valentine
as i hope your catharine will be mine for the
season and let me not keep your old head
longer from the pillow but make interest with
your featherbed till daybreak and then you
must be my guide to your daughter's chamberdoor
and my apology for entering it to bid her
good morrow for the brightest that the sun will
awaken in the city or for miles round it 
no bad advice my son said the honest
glover but you what will you do will
you lie down beside me or take a part conachar's
bed 
neither answered harry gow i
should but prevent your rest and for me this
easychair is worth a down bed and i will sleep
like a sentinel with my graith about me
as he spoke he laid his hand on his sword
nay heaven send us no more need weapons
 good night or rather good morrow
till daypeep and the first who wakes calls up
the other
thus parted the two burghers the glover
retired to his bed and it is to be supposed to
rest the lover was not so fortunate his bodily
frame easily bore the fatigue which he had
encountered in the course the night but his
i 
mind was a different and more delicate
mould in one point view he was but the
stout burgher his period proud alike his
art in making weapons and wielding them
when made his professional jealousy personal
strength and skid in the use arms brought
him into many quarrels which had made him
generally feared and in some instances disliked
but with these qualities were united
the simple goodnature a child and at the
same time an imaginative and enthusiastic temper
which seemed little to correspond with his
labours at the forge or his combats in the field
perhaps a little the hairbrained and ardent
feeling which he had picked out old ballads
or from the metrical romances which were his
sole source information or knowledge may
have been the means pricking him on to some
 his achievements which had often a rude
strain chivalry in them at least it was certain
that his love to the fair catharine had in ita
delicacy such as might have become the squire
 low degree who was honoured if song speaks
truth with the smiles the king hungary's
daughter his sentiments towards her were certainly
as exalted as if they had been fixed upon
an actual angel which made old simon and
others who watched his conduct think that his
passion was too high and devotional to be successful
with maiden mortal mould they
were mistaken however catharine coy and
reserved as she was had a heart which could
feel and understand the nature and depth the
armourer's passion and whether she was able
to repay it or not she had as much secret pride
in the attachment the redoubted henry gowns
a lady romance may be supposed to have
in the company a tame lion who follows to
provide for and defend her it was with sentiments
 the most sincere gratitude that she
recollected as she awoke at dawn the services
 henry during the course the eventful
night and the first thought which she dwelt
upon was the means making him understand
her feelings
arising hastily from bed and half blushing
at her own purpose i have been cold to him
and perhaps unjust i will not be ungrateful
she said to herself though i cannot yield to
his suit i will not wait till my father compels
me to receive him as my valentine for the year 
i will seek him out and choose him myself i
have thought other girls bold when they did
something like this but i shall thus best please
my father and but discharge the rites due to
good saint valentine by showing my gratitude
to this brave man
hastily slipping on her dress which nevertheless
was left a good deal more disordered
than usual she tripped down stairs and opened
the door the chamber in which as she had
guessed her lover had passed the hours after
the fray catharine paused at the door and
became half afraid executing her purpose
which not only permitted but enjoined the valentines
 the year to begin their connexion
with a kiss affection it was looked upon asa
peculiarly propitious omen if the one party
could find the other asleep and awaken him or
her by performance this interesting ceremony

never was a fairer opportunity offered for
commencing this mystic tic than that which
now presented itself to catharine after many
and various thoughts sleep had at length overcome
the stout armourer in the chair in which
he had deposited himself his features in repose
had a more firm and manly cast than catharine
had thought who having generally seen
them fluctuating between shamefacedness and
apprehension her displeasure had been used
to connect with them some idea imbecility
he looks very stern she said if he
should be angry and then when he awakes 
we are alone if i should call dorothy if i
should wake my father but no it is a thing
 custom and done in all maidenly and sisterly
love and honour i will not suppose that henry
can misconstrue it and i will not let a childish
fear put my gratitude to sleep
so saying she tripped along the floor the
apartment with a light though hesitating step
and a cheek crimsoned at her own purpose and
gliding to the chair the sleeper dropped a
kiss upon his lips as light as if a roseleaf had
fallen on them the slumbers must have been
slight which such a touch could dispel and
the dreams the sleeper must needs have been
connected with the cause the interruption
since henry instantly starting up caught the
maiden in his arms and attempted to return
in ecstasy the salute which had broken his repose
but catharine struggled in his embrace 
and as her efforts implied alarmed modesty
rather than maidenly coyness her bashful lover
suffered her to escape a grasp from which
twenty times her strength could not have extricated
her
nay be not angry good henry said catharine
in the kindest tone to her surprised
lover i have paid my vows to saint valentine
to show how i value the mate which he
has sent me for the year let but my father
be present and i will not dare to refuse thee
the revenge you may claim for a broken sleep
let not that be a hinderance said the old
glover rushing in ecstasy into the room to
her smith to her strike while the iron is
hot and teach her what it is not to let sleeping
dogs lie still
thus encouraged henry though perhaps
with less alarming vivacity again seized the
blushing maiden in his arms who submitted
with a tolerable grace to receive repayment 
her salute a dozen times repeated and with an
energy very different from that which had provoked
such severe retaliation at length she
again extricated herself from her lover's arms
and as if frightened and repenting what she
had done threw herself into a seat and covered
her face with her hands
cheer up thou silly girl said her father
and be not ashamed that thou hast made the
two happiest men in perth since thy old father
is one them never was kiss so well bestowed
and meet it is that it should be suitably returned
look up my darling look up and let
me see thee but give one smile by my honest
word the sun that now rises over our fair city
shows no sight that can give me greater pleasure
 what he continued in a jocose tone
thou though st thou hadst jamie eddie's
ring and couldst walk invisible but not so my
fairy the dawning just as i was about to
rise i heard tby chamber door open and watched
thee down stairs not to protect thee against
this sleepyheaded henry but to see with my
own delighted eyes my beloved girl do that
which her father most wished come put
down these foolish hands and though thou
blushes a little it will only the better grace
st valentine's morn when blushes best become
a maiden's cheek
as simon glover spoke he pulled away
with gentle violence the hands which hid his
daughter's face she blushed deeply indeed
but there was more than maiden's shame in her
face and her eyes were fast filling with tears
what weeping love continued her father
 nay nay this is more than need 
henry help me to comfort this little fool
catharine made an effort to collect herself
and to smile but the smile was a melancholy
and serious cast
i only meant to say father said the fair
maid perth with continued exertion that
in choosing henry gow for my valentine and
rendering to him the rights and greeting the
vol i i
morning according to wonted custom i meant
bat to show my gratitude to him for his manly
and faithful service and my obedience to
you but do not lead him to think and oh
dearest father do not yourself entertain an idea
that i meant more than what the promise to be
his faithful and affectionate valentine through
the year requires me
ay ay ay ay we understand it all
said simon in the soothing tone which nurses
apply to children we understand what the
meaning is enough for once enough for once
thou shalt not be frightened or hurried loving
true and faithful valentines are ye and
the rest as heaven and opportunity shall permit
come prithee have donewring not
thy tiny hands nor fear farther persecution
now thou hast done bravely excellently 
and now away to dorothy and call up the old
sluggard we must have a substantial breakfast
after a night confusion and a morning
 joy and thy hand will be needed to prepare
for us some these delicate cakes which no
one can make but thyself and well hast thou
a right to the secret seeing who taught it thee
ah health to the soul thy dearest mother
he added with a sigh how blithe would she
have been to see this happy st valentine's
morning 
catharine took the opportunity escape
which was thus given her and glided from the
room to henry it seemed as if the sun had
disappeared from the heaven at midday and left
the world in sudden obscurity even the highswelled
hopes with which the late incident had
filled him began to quail as he reflected upon
her altered demeanour the tears in her eyes 
the obvious fear which occupied her features 
and the pains she had taken to show as plainly
as delicacy would permit that the advances
which she had made to him were limited to the
character with which the rites the day had
invested him her father looked on his fallen
countenance with something like surprise and
displeasure
in the name good st john what has befallen
you that makes you look as grave as an
owl when a lad your spirit having really
such a fancy for this poor girl as you pretend
ought to be as lively as a lark 
alas father replied the crestfallen lover
 there is that written on her brow which
says she loves me well enough to be my valentine
especially since you wish it but not well
enough to be my wife
now a plague on thee for a cold downhearted
goosecap answered the father i
can read a woman's brow as well and better
than thou and i can see no such matter on
hers what the foul fiend man there thou
wast lying like a lord in thy elbowchair as
sound asleep as a judge when hadst thou been
a lover any spirit thou wouldst have been
watching the east for the first ray the sun
but there thou latest snoring i warrant thinking
nought about her or anything else and
the poor girl rises at peep day lest any one
else should pick up her most precious and vigilant
valentine and wakes thee with a grace
which so help me st macgrider would
have put life in an anvil and thou awakes
to hone and pine and moan as if she had
lj
drawn a hot iron across thy lips i would to
st john she had sent old dorothy on the errand
and bound thee for thy valentine service
to that bundle dry bones with never a tooth
in her head she were fittest valentine in
perth for so craven a wooer
as to craven father answered the smith
there are twenty good cocks whose combs i
have plucked can tell thee if i am craven or no
and heaven knows that i would give my good
land held by burgess tenure with smithy bellows
tongs anvil and all providing it would
make your view the matter the true one but
it is not her coyness or her blushes that i
speak it is the paleness which so soon followed
the red and chased it from her cheeks 
and it is the tears which succeeded it was
like the april shower stealing upon and obscuring
the fairest dawning that ever beamed
over the tay
tutti tahiti replied the glover neither
rome nor perth were built in a day thou hast
fished salmon a thousand times and nights
have taken a lesson when the fish has taken
the fly to pull a hard strain on the line would
snap the tackle to pieces were it made wire
ease your hand man and let him rise take
leisure and in halfanhour thou layesthim on
the bank there is a beginning as fair as you
could wish unless you expect the poor wench
to come to thy bedside as she did to thy chair 
and that is not the fashion modest maidens
but observe me after we have had our breakfast
i will take care thou hast an opportunity
to speak thy mind only beware thou be neither
too backward nor press her too hard give
her line enough but do not slack too fast and
my life for yours upon the issue
do what i can father answered henry
you will always lay the blame on me either
that i give too much head or that i strain the
tackle i would give the best habergeon i ever
wrought that the difficulty in truth rested with
me for there were then the better chance its
being removed i own however i am but an
ass in the trick bringing about such discourse
as is to the purpose for the occasion
come into the booth with me my son and
i will furnish thee with a fitting theme thou
knowest the maiden who ventures to kiss a
sleeping man wins him a pair gloves
come to my booth thou shalt have a pair 
delicate kidskin that will exactly suit her hand
and arm i was thinking her poor mother
when i shaped them added honest simon with
a sigh and except catharine i know not
the woman in scotland whom they would fit
though i have measured most the high beauties
 the court come with me i say and
thou shalt be provided with a theme to wag thy
tongue upon providing thou have courage and
caution to stand by thee in thy wooing
chapter v
never to man shall catharine give her hand
taming a shrew
the breakfast was served and the thin soft
cakes made flour and honey according to
the family receipt were not only commended
with all the partiality a father and a lover
but done liberal justice to in the mode which
is best proof cake as well as pudding they
talked jested and laughed catharine too
had recovered her equanimity where the dames
and damsels the period were apt to lose theirs
in the kitchen namely and in the superintendence
 household affairs in which she was an
adept i question much if the perusal seneca
for as long a period would have had equal
effect in composing her mind
old dorothy sate down at the boardend as
was the homespun fashion the period and
so much were the two men amused with their
own conversation and catharine occupied
either in attending to them or with her own reflections
 that the old woman was the first
who observed the absence the boy conachar
it is true said the master glover go
call him the idle highland loon he was not
seen last night during the fray neither at least
i saw him not did any you observe him 
the reply was negative and henry's observation
followed 
there are times when highlanders can
couch like their own deer ay and run from
danger too as fast i have seen them do so
myself for the matter that
 and there are times replied simon
when king arthur and his round table could
not make stand against them i wish henry you
would speak more reverently the highlanders
they are often in perth both alone and in
numbers and you ought to keep peace with
them so long as they will keep peace with you
an answer defiance rose to henry's lips
but be prudently suppressed it
why thou knowest father he said smiling
 that we handicrafts best love the folks
we live by now my craft provides for valiant
and noble knights gentle squires and pages
stout menatarms and others that wear the
arms which we make it is natural i should
like the ruthless the lindsay the ogilvys
the oliphant and so many others our brave
and noble neighbours who are sheathed in
steel my making like so many paladins
better than those naked snatching mountaineers
who are ever doing us wrong especially
since no five each clan have a rusty shirt
 mail as old as their br attach and that is but
the work the clumsy clansmith after all
who is no member our honourable mystery
but simply works at the anvil where his father
wrought before him i say such people can
have no favour in the eyes an honest craftsman

well well answered simon i prithee
 standard
let the matter rest even now for here comes
the loitering boy and though it is a holiday
morn i want no more bloody puddings
the youth entered accordingly his face was
pale his eyes red and there was an air discomposure
about his whole person he sate
down at the lower the table opposite to
dorothy and crossed himself as if preparing
for his morning's meal as he did not help
himself to any food catharine offered him a
platter containing some the cakes which had
met with such general approbation at first
he rejected her offered kindness rather sullenly 
but on her repeating the offer with a smile 
good will he took a cake in his hand broke it
and was about to eat a morsel when the effort
to swallow seemed almost too much for him 
and though he succeeded he did not repeat it
you have a bad appetite for saint valentine's
morning conachar said his goodhumoured
master and yet i think you must
have slept soundly the night before since i conclude
you were not disturbed by the noise 
the scuffle why i thought a lively glunami
would have been at his master's side dirk in
hand at the first sound danger which arose
within a mile us
i heard but an indistinct noise said the
youth his face glowing suddenly like a heated
coal which i took for the shout some
merry revellers and you are wont to bid me
never open door or window or alarm the house
on the score such folly
well well said simon i thought a
highlander would have known better the difference
betwixt the clash swords and the
twanging on harps the wild warcry and the
merry hunts up but let it pass boy i am
glad thou art losing thy quarrelsome fashions
eat thy breakfast any way as i have that to
employ thee which requires haste
i have breakfasted already and am in haste
myself i am for the hills have you any message
to my father 
none replied the glover in some surprise
but art thou beside thyself boy or what
a vengeance takes thee from the city like the
wing the whirlwind
my warning has been sudden said concha
speaking with difficulty but whether arising
from the hesitation incidental to the use 
a foreign language or whether from some other
cause could not easily be distinguished there
is to be a meeting a great hunting here
he stopped
and when are you to return from this
blessed hunting said his master that is
if i may make so bold as to ask
i cannot exactly answer replied the apprentice
 perhaps never if such be my father's
pleasure continued conachar with assumed
indifference
i thought said simon glover rather seriously
 that all this was to be laid aside
when at earnest intercession i took you under
my roof i thought that when i undertook being
very loath to do so to teach you an honest
trade we were to hear no more hunting or
hosting or clangatherings or any matters 
the kind
i was not consulted when i was sent hither
said the lad haughtily i cannot tell
what the terms were
but i can tell you sir conachar said
the glover angrily that there is no fashion
u
 honesty in binding yourself to an honest
craftsman and spoiling more hides than your
own is worth and now when you are age
to be some service in taking up the disposal
 your time at your pleasure as if it were your
own property not your masters
reckon with my father about that answered
conachar he will pay you gallantly 
a french mutton for every hide i have spoiled
and a fat cow or bullock for each day i have
been absent
close with him friend glover close with
him said the armourer drily l thou wiltbe paid
gallantly at least if not honestly methinks i
would like to know how many purses have been
emptied to fill the goatskin sporranf that is to
be so free to you its gold and whose pastures
mouton a french gold coin so called from its being impressed
with the image a lamb
f the highland pouch generally formed goatskin and
worn in front the garb is called in gaelic a sporran a
sporranmouuach is a shaggy pouch formed as they usually
are goatskin or some such material with the rough side
outermost
the bullocks have been calved in that are to be
sent down to you from the grampian passes
you remind me friend said the highland
youth turning haughtily towards the
smith that i have also a reckoning to hold
with you
keep at arm'slength then said henry
extending his brawny arm i will have no
more close hugs no more bodkin work like
last night i care little for a wasp's sting yet
i will not allow the insect to come near me if i
have warning
conachar smiled contemptuously i meant
thee no harm he said my father's son did
thee but too much honour to spill such churl's
blood i will pay you for it by the drop that it
may be dried up and no longer soil my fingers
peace thou bragging ape said the smith 
the blood a true man cannot be valued in
gold the only expiation would be that thou
shouldst come a mile into the low country
with two the strongest galloglasses thy
clan and while i dealt with them i would leave
thee to the correction my apprentice little
nankin
here catharine interposed peace she
said my trusty valentine whom i have a right
to command and peace you conachar who
ought to obey me as your master's daughter
it is ill done to awaken again on the morrow
the evil which has been laid to sleep at night
farewell then master said conachar after
another look scorn at the smith which he
only answered with a laugh farewell and i
thank you for your kindness which has been
more than i deserved if i have at times seemed
less than thankful it was the fault circumstances
and not my will catharine he
cast upon the maiden a look strong emotion
in which various feelings were blended he hesitated
as if to say something and at length
turned away with the single woidfarewell five
minutes afterwards with highland buskins on
his feet and a small bundle in his hand he
passed through the north gate perth and directed
his course to the highlands
there goes enough beggary and pride
for a whole highland clan said henry he
talks as familiarly gold pieces as i would 
silver pennies and yet i will be sworn that the
thumb his mother's worsted glove might hold
the treasure the whole clan
like enough said the glover laughing at
the idea his mother was a largeboned woman
especially in the fingers and wrist
and as for cattle continued henry i
reckon his father and brothers steal sheep by
one at a time
the less we say them the better said
the glover becoming again grave rt brothers
he hath none his father is a powerful man 
hath long hands reaches as far as he can and
hears farther than it is necessary to talk 
him
and yet he hath bound his only son apprentice
to a glover in perth said henry
why i should have thought the gentle craft
as it is called st crispin would have suited
him best and that if the son some great mac
or o was to become an artizan it could only be
in the craft where princes set him the example
this remark though ironical seemed to away
i k
ken our friend simon's sense professional
dignity which was a prevailing feeling that
marked the manners the artizans the time
you err son henry he replied with much
gravity the glovers are the more honourable
craft the two in regard they provide
for the accommodation the hands whereas
the shoemakers and cordwainers do but work
for the feet
both equally necessary members the
body corporate said henry whose father had
been a cordwainer
it may be so my son said the glover 
but not both alike honourable bethink you
that we employ the hands as pledges friendship
and good faith and the feet have no such privilege
brave men fight with their hands 
cowards employ their feet in flight a glove
is borne aloft a shoe is trampled in the mire 
a man greets a friend with his open hand
he spurns a dog or one whom he holds as mean
as a dog with his advanced foot a glove on
the point a spear is a sign and pledge 
faith all the wide world over as a gauntlet

flung down is a gage knightly battle while
i know no other emblem belonging to an old
shoe except that some crones will fling them
after a man by way good luck in which
practice i avow myself to entertain no confidence

m nay said the smith amused with his
friend's eloquent pleading for the dignity the
art he practised i am not the man i promise
you to disparage the glover's mystery bethink
you i am myself a maker gauntlets
but the dignity your ancient craft removes
not my wonder that the father this concha
suffered his son to learn a trade any
kind from a lowland craftsman holding us
as they do altogether beneath their magnificent
degree and a race contemptible drudges unworthy
 any other fate than to be ill used
and plundered as often as these barebreeches
dunniewassals see safety and convenience for
doing so
ay answered the glover but there
were powerful reasons for for he
withheld something which seemed upon his
lips and went on for conaclmr's father acting
as he did well i have played fair with
him and i do not doubt but he will act honourably
by me butconachar's sudden leavetaking
has put me to some inconvenience he
had things under his charge i must look
through the booth
can i help you father said henry undeceived
by the earnestness his manner
you no said simon with a dryness
which made henry so sensible the simplicity
 his proposal that he blushed to the eyes at
his own dulness comprehension in a matter
where love ought to have induced him to take
his cue easily up you catharine said the
glover as he left the room entertain your
valentine for five minutes and see he departs
not till my return come hither with me old
dorothy and bestir thy limbs in my behalf
he left the room followed by the old woman 
and henry smith remained with catharine almost
for the first time in his life entirely alone
there was embarrassment on the maiden's part
and awkwardness on that the lover for about
ua
minute when henry calling up his courage
pulled the gloves put his pocket with which
simon had supplied him and asked her to permit
one who had been so highly graced that
morning to pay the usual penalty for being
asleep at the moment when he would have
given the slumbers a whole twelvemonth to
be awake for a single minute
nay but said catharine the fulfilment
 my homage to st valentine infers no such
penalty as you desire to pay and i cannot
therefore think accepting them
these gloves said henry advancing his
seat insidiously towards catharine as he spoke
were wrought by the hands that are dearest
to you and see they are shaped for your
own he extended them as he spoke and taking
her arm in his robust hand spread the gloves
beside it to show how well they fitted look
at that taper arm he said look at these
small fingers think who sewed these seams 
silk and gold and think whether the glove
and the arm which alone the glove can fit ought
to remain separate because the poor glove has
had the misfortune to be for a passing minute
in the keeping a hand so swart and rough as
mine
they are welcome as coming from my father
said catharine and surely not less so
as coming from my friend and there was an
emphasis on the word as well as my valentine
and preserver
let me aid to do them on said the smith
bringing himself yet closer to her side they
may seem a little over tight at first and you
may require some assistance
you are skilful in such service good henry
gow said the maiden smiling but at the
same time drawing farther from her lover
in good faith no said henry shaking his
head my experience has been in donning
steel gauntlets on mailed knights more than in
fitting embroidered gloves upon maidens
i will trouble you then no further and
dorothy shall aid me though there needs no assistance
 my father's eye and fingers are faithful
to his craft what work he puts through his
hands is always true to the measure
let me be convinced it said the smith 
let me see that these slender gloves actually
match the hands they were made for
some other time good henry answered
the maiden i will wear the gloves in honour
 st valentine and the mate he has sent me for
the season i would to heaven i could pleasure
my father as well in weightier matters at present
the perfume the leather harms the headach
i have had since morning
headeach dearest maiden echoed her
lover
if you call it heartach you will not misname
it said catharine with a sigh and proceeded
to speak in a very serious tone henry
she said i am going perhaps to be as
bold as i gave you reason to think me this
morning for i am about to speak the first upon
a subject on which it may well be i ought to
wait till i had to answer you but i cannot
after what has happened this morning suffer my
feelings towards you to remain unexplained
without the possibility my being greatly misconceived
 nay do not answer till you have

heard me out you are brave henry beyond
most men honest and true as the steel you
work upon 
stop stop catharine for mercy's sake 
you never said so much that was good concerning
me save to introduce some bitter censure
 which your praises were the harbingers
i am honest and so forth you would say buta
hotbrained brawler and common shorter
or stabber
i should injure both myself and you in
calling you such no henry to no common
stabber had he worn a plume in his bonnet
and gold spurs on his heels would catharine
glover have offered the little grace she has this
day voluntarily done to you if i have at times
dwelt severely upon the proneness your spirit
to anger and your hand to strife it is because
i would have you if i could so persuade
you hate in yourself the sins vanity and
wrath by which you are most easily beset i
have spoken on the topic more to alarm your
own conscience than to express my opinion i
know as well as my father that in thcbe force

lord and desperate days the whole customs 
our nation nay every christian nation maybe
quoted in favour bloody quarrels for trifling
causes the taking deadly and deep revenge
for slight offences and the slaughter 
each other for emulation honour or often in
mere sport but i know that for all these
things we shall one day be called into judgment
 and fain would i convince thee my
brave and generous friend to listen oftener to
the dictates thy good heart and take less
pride in the strength and dexterity thy unsparing
arm
i am i am convinced catharine exclaimed
henry thy words shall henceforward
be a law to me i have done enough
far too much indeed for proof my bodily
strength and courage but it is only from you
catharine that i can learn a better way 
thinking remember my fair valentine that
my ambition distinction in arms and my
love strife if it can be called such do not
fight evenhanded with my reason and my
milder dispositions but have their patrons and
sticklers to egg them on is there a quarrel 
and suppose that i thinking on your counsels
am something loth to engage in it believe
you i am left to decide between peace or war at
my own choosing not so by st mary there
are a hundred round me to stir me on why
how now smith is thy mainspring rusted says
one jolly henry is deaf on the quarrelling
ear this morning says another stand to it
for the honour perth says my lord the provost
 harry against them for a gold noble
cries your father perhaps now what can a
poor fellow do catharine when all are hallooing
him on in the devil's name and not a soul
putting in a word on the other side 
nay i know the devil has factors enough
to utter his wares said catharine but it is
our duty to despise such idle arguments though
they may be pleaded even by those to whom we
owe much love and honour
then there are the minstrels with their
romaunt and ballads which place all a man's
praise in receiving and repaying hard blows
it is sad to tell catharine how many my
sins that blind harry the minstrel hath to answer
for when i hit a downright blow it is
not so save me st john to do any man
injury but only to strike as william wallace
struck
the minstrels namesake spoke this in such
a tone rueful seriousness that catharine
could scarce forbear smiling but nevertheless
she assured him that the danger his own and
other men's lives ought not for a moment to be
weighed against such simple toys
ay but replied henry emboldened by
her smiles methinks now the good cause 
peace would thrive all the better for an advocate
suppose for example that when i am pressed
and urged to lay hand on my weapon i could
have cause to recollect that there was a gentle
and guardian angel at home whose image would
seem to whisper henry do no violence it
is my hand which you crimson with blood 
henry rush upon no idle danger it is my
breast which you expose to injury such
thoughts would do more to restrain my mood
than if every monk in perth should cry hold
thy hand on pain bell and candle 
if such a warning as could be given by the
voice sisterly affection can have weight in the
debate said catharine do think that in striking
you empurple this hand that in receiving
wounds you harm this heart
the smith took courage at the sincerely affectionate
tone in which these words were delivered

and wherefore not stretch your regard a
degree beyond these cold limits why since you
are so kind and generous as to own some interest
in the poor ignorant sinner before you
should you not at once adopt him as your scholar
and your husband your father desires it 
the town expects it glovers and smiths are
preparing their rejoicing and you only you
whose words are so fair and so kind you will
not give your consent 
henry said catharine in a low and tremulous
voice believe me i should hold it my
duty to comply with my father's commands
were there not obstacles invincible to the
match which he proposes
fcc yet think think but for a moment 
have little to say for myself in comparison 
you who can both read and write but then
i wish to hear reading and could listen to your
sweet voice for ever you love music and i
have been taught to play and sing as well as
some minstrels you love to be charitable i
have enough to give and enough to keep as
large a daily alms as a deacon gives would
never be missed by me your father gets old
for daily toil he would live with us as i should
truly hold him for my father also i would be
as chary mixing in causeless strife as 
thrusting my hand into my own furnace and
if there came on us unlawful violence its wares
would be brought to an illchosen market
may you experience all the domestic happiness
which you can conceive henry but
with some one more happy than i am
so spoke or rather so sobbed the fair maiden
 perth who seemed choking in the attempt
to restrain her tears
you hate me then said the lover after
a pause
heaven is mv witness no
or you love some other better 
it is cruel to ask what it cannot avail you
to know but you are entirely mistaken
yon wildcat conachar perhaps said
henry i have marked his looks 
you avail yourself this painful situation
to insult me henry though i have little deserved
it conachar is nothing to me more
than the trying to tame his wild spirit by instruction
might lead me to take some interest
in a mind abandoned to prejudices and passions
and therein henry not unlike your own
it must then be some these flaunting
silk worm sirs about the court said the armourer
his natural heat temper kindling
from disappointment and vexation some 
those who think they carry it off through the
height their plumed bonnets and the jingle
 their spurs i would i knew which it was
that leaving his natural mates the painted and
perfumed dames the court comes to take
his prey among the simple maidens the
burgher craft i would i knew but his name
and surname 

henry smith said catharine shaking off
the weakness which seemed to threaten to overpower
her a moment before this is the language
 an ungrateful fool or rather a frantic
madman i have told you already there
was no one who stood at the beginning this
conference more high in my opinion than he
who is now losing ground with every word he
utters in the tone unjust suspicion and senseless
anger you had no title to know even what
i have told you which i pray you to observe
implies no preference to you over others though
it disowns any preference another to you it
is enough you should be aware that there is as
insuperable an objection to what you desire as
if an enchante had a spell over my destiny
spells may be broken by true men y said
the smith i would it were come to that
thorbiorn the danish armourer spoke a
spell he had for making breastplates by singing
a certain song while the iron was heating
i told him that his runic rhymes were no proof
against the weapons which fought at loncarty
what farther came it it is needless to tell 
but the corslet and the wearer and the leech
who salved his wound know if henry gowan
break a spell or no
catharine looked at him as if about to return
an answer little approving the exploit he had
vaunted which the downright smith had not
recollected was a kind that exposed him to
her frequent censure but ere she had given
words to her thoughts her father thrust his
head in at the door
henry he said i must interrupt your
more pleasing affairs and request you to come
into my working room in all speed to consult
about certain matters deeply affecting the weal
 the burgh
henry making his obeisance to catharine
left the apartment upon her father's summons
indeed it was probably in favour their future
friendly intercourse that they were parted on
this occasion at the turn which the conversation
seemed likely to take for as the wooer
had begun to hold the refusal the damsel as
somewhat capricious and inexplicable after the
degree encouragement which in his opinion
g
she had afforded catharine on the other hand
considered him rather as an encroacher upon
the grace which she had shown him than one
whose delicacy rendered him deserving such
favour
but there was living in their bosoms towards
each other a reciprocal kindness which on the
termination the dispute was sure to revive
inducing the maiden to forget her offended delicacy
and the lover his slighted warmth 
passion

chapter 
this quarrel may draw blood another day
henry part 
the conclave citizens appointed to meet for
investigating the affray the preceding evening
had now assembled the workroom 
simon glover was filled to crowding by personages
 no little consequence some whom
wore black velvet cloaks and gold chains around
their necks they were indeed the fathers 
the city and there were bailies and deacons in
the honoured number there was an ireful
and offended air importance upon every
brow as they conversed together rather in
whisper than aloud or in detail busiest among
the busy the little important assistant the
previous night oliver proudfute by name and
bonnetmaker by profession was bustling among
the crowd much after the manner the seagull
which flutters screams and sputters most
at the commencement a gale wind though
one can hardly conceive what the bird has better
to do than to fly to its nest and remain quiet
till the gale is over
be that as it may master proudfute was in
the midst the crowd his fingers upon everyone's
button and his mouth in every man's ear
embracing such as were near to his own stature
that he might more closely and mysteriously
utter his sentiments and standing on tip
toe and supporting himself by the cloakcollars
 tall men that he might dole out to them
also the same share information he felt
himself one the heroes the affair being
conscious the dignity superior information
on the subject as an eyewitness and much disposed
to push his connexion with the scuffle a
few points beyond the modesty truth it
cannot be said his communications were in
especial curious and important consisting chiefly
 such assertions as these 
it is all true bv st john i was there
and saw it myself was the first to run to the
fray and if it had not been for me and another
stout fellow who came in about the same time
they had broken into simon glover's house
cut his throat and carried his daughter off to
the mountains it is too evil usage not to be
suffered neighbour crookshank not to be endured
neighbour glass not to be borne neighbours
balneaves pollock and christen it
was a mercy that i and that stout fellow came
in was it not neighbour and worthy bailie
craigdallie 
these speeches were dispersed by the busy
bonnetmaker into sundry ears bailie craigdallied
a portly guildbrother the same who had
advised the prorogation their civic council to
the present place and hour a big burly goodlooking
man shook the deacon from his cloak
with pretty much the grace with which a large
horse shrugs off the importunate fly that has
beset him for ten minutes and exclaimed silence
good citizens here comes simon glover
in whom no man ever saw falsehood we will
hear the outrage from his own mouth
simon being called upon to tell his tale did
so with obvious embarrassment which he imputed
to a reluctance that the burgh should be
put in deadly feud with any one upon his account
it was he dared to say a masking or
revel on the part the young gallants about
court and the worst that might come it
would be that he would put iron sanctions
on his daughter's window in case such another
frolic
why then if this was a mere masking or
mummery said craigdallie our townsman
harry the wynd did far wrong to cut off a
gentleman's hand for such a harmless pleasantry
and the town may be brought to a
heavy fine for it unless we secure the person
 the mutilator
our lady forbid said the glover did
you know what i do you would be as much
afraid handling this matter as if it were
glowing iron but since you will needs put
your fingers in the fire truth must be spoken
and come what will i must say that the
matter might have ended ill for me and mine

but for the opportune assistance henry goethe
armourer well known to you all
and mine also was not wanting said
oliver proudfute though i do not profess to
be utterly so good a swordsman as our neighbour
henry gow you saw me neighbour
glover at the beginning the fray 
i saw you after the it neighbour
answered the glover drily
true true i had forgot you were in your
house while the blows were going and could
not survey who were dealing them
peace neighbour proudfute i prithee
peace said craigdallie who was obviously
tired the tuneless screeching the worthy
deacon
there is something mysterious here said
the bailie but i think i spy the secret our
friend simon is as you all know a peaceful
man and one that will rather sit down with
wrong than put a friend or say a neighbourhood
in danger to seek his redress thou
henry who art never wanting where the
burgh needs a defender tell us what thou knowest
 this matter
our smith told his story to the same purpose
which we have already related and the meddling
maker bonnets added as before and
thou safest me there honest smith didst thou
not 
not i in good faith neighbour answered
henry but you are a little man you know
and i might overlook you
this reply produced a laugh at oliver's expense
who laughed for company but added
m i was one the foremost to the rescue for all
that
why where wert thou then neighbour 
said the smith for i saw you not and i
would have given the worth the best suit 
armour i ever wrought to have seen as stout a
fellow as thou at my elbow
i was no farther off however honest smith 
and whilst thou wert laying on blows as if on an
anvil i was parrying those that the rest the
villains aimed at thee behind thy back and that
is the cause thou safest me not
i have heard smiths old time who
had but one eye said henry i have two
but they are both set in my forehead and so i
could not see behind my back neighbour
the truth is however persevered master
oliver there i was and i will give master
bailie my account the matter for the smith
and i were first up to the fray
enough at present said the bailie waving
to master proudfute an injunction silence
the precognition simon glover and henry
gow would bear out a matter less worthy 
belief and now my masters your opinion
what should be done here are all our burgher
rights broken through and insulted and you
may well fancy that it is by some man power
since no less dared have attempted such an outrage
my masters it is hard on flesh and blood
to submit to this the laws have framed us 
lower rank than the princes and nobles yet it
is against reason to suppose that we will suffer
our houses to be broken into and the honour 
our women insulted without some redress
it is not to be endured answered the citizens
unanimously
here simon glover interfered with a very
anxious and ominous countenance i hope
still that all was not meant so ill as it seemed
to us my worthy neighbours and i for one
would cheerfully forgive the alarm and disturbance
to my poor house providing the fair city
were not brought into jeopardy for me i beseech
you to consider who are to be our judges
that are to hear the case and give or refuse redress
i speak among neighbours and friends
and therefore i speak openly the king god
bless him is so broken in mind and body that
he will but turn us over to some great man
amongst his councillors who shall be in favour
for the time perchance he will refer us to
his brother the duke albany who will make
our petition for righting our wrongs the pretence
for squeezing money out us
we will none albany for our judge
answered the meeting with the same unanimity
as before
or perhaps added simon he will bid
the duke rothsay take charge it and the
wild young prince will regard the outrage as
something for his gay companions to scoff at
and his minstrels to turn into a song
away with rothsay he is too gay to be
our judge again exclaimed the citizens
simon emboldened by seeing he was reaching
the point he aimed at yet pronouncing the
dreaded name with a half whisper next added
would you like the black douglas better to
deal with 
there was no answer for a minute they
looked on each other with fallen countenances
and blanched lips but henry smith spoke out
boldly and in a decided voice the sentiments
which all felt but none else dared give words
to
the black douglas to judge betwixt a
burgher and a gentleman nay a nobleman for
all i know or care the black devil hell
sooner you are mad father simon so much
as to name so wild a proposal
there was again a silence fear and uncertainty
which was at length broken by bailie
craigdallie who looking very significantly to
the speaker replied you are confident in a
stout doublet neighbour smith or you would
not talk so boldly
i am confident a good heart under my
doublet such as it is bailie answered the undaunted
henry and though i speak but little
my mouth shall never be padlocked by any
noble them all
wear a thick doublet good henry or do
not speak so loud reiterated the bailie in the
same significant tone there are border menin
the town who wear the bloody heart on their
shoulder but all this is no rede what shall
we do 
short rede good rede said the smith
let us to our provost and demand his countenance
and assistance
a murmur applause went through the
party and oliver proudfute exclaimed that
is what i have been saying for this half hour
and not one ye would listen to me let us
go to our provost said i he is a gentleman
himself and ought to come between the burgh
and the nobles in all matters
hush neighbours hush be wary what
you say or do said a thin meagre figure a
man whose diminutive person seemed still more
reduced in size and more assimilated to a shadow
by his efforts to assume an extreme degree
 humility and make himself to suit his argument
look meaner yet and yet more insignificant
than nature had made him
m pardon me said he i am but a poor 
nevertheless i have been bred in paris
and learned my humanities and my cursus mededi
as well as some that call themselves learned
leeches methinks i can tent this wound
and treat it with emollients here is our friend
simon glover who is as you all know a man
 worship think you he would not be the
most willing us all to pursue harsh courses
here since his family honour is so nearly concerned
 and since he blenches away from the
charge against these same revellers consider if
he may not have some good reason more than
he cares to utter for letting the matter sleep it
is not for me to put my finger on the sore but
alack we all know that young maidens are
what i call fugitive essences suppose now an
honest maiden i mean in all innocence leaves
her window unlatched on st valentine's morn
that some gallant cavalier may in all honesty
i mean become her valentine for the season 
and suppose the gallant be discovered may she
not scream out as if the visit were unexpected
and and bray all this in a mortar and then
consider will it be a matter to place the town
in feud for 
the pottingar delivered his opinion in a most
insinuating manner but he seemed to shrink
into something less than his natural tenuity
when he saw the blood rise in the old cheeks
 simon glover and inflame to the temples
the complexion the redoubled smith the
last stepping forward and turning a stern look
on the alarmed pottingar broke out as follows
 thou walking skeleton thou asthmatic
gallipot thou poisoner by profession if
i thought that the puff vile breath thou hast
left could blight for the tenth part a minute
the fair fame catharine glover i would
pound thee quacksalver in thine own mortar
and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower
 brimstone the only real medicine in thy
booth to make a salve to rub mangy hounds
with 
hold son henry hold cried the glover
in a tone authority no man has title to
speak this matter but me worshipful bailie
craigdallie since such is the construction that
is put upon my patience i am willing to pursue
this riot to the uttermost and though the
issue may prove that we had better have been
patient you will all see that my catharine hath
not by any lightness or folly hers afforded
grounds for this great scandal
the bailie also interposed u neighbour henry
said he we came here to consult and not
to quarrel as one the fathers the fair city
i command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent
you may have against master pottingar
dwining 
he is too poor a creature bailie said
henry gow for me to harbour feud with 
i that could destroy him and his booth with
one blow my forehammer
peace then and hear me said the official
 we all are as much believers in the honour 
the fair maiden perth as in that our
blessed lady here he crossed himself devoutly
 but touching our appeal to our provost
are you agreed neighbours to put matter like
this into our provost's hand being against a
powerful noble as is to be feared 
the provost being himself a nobleman 
squeaked the pottingar in some measure released
from his terror by the intervention the
bailie god knows i speak not to the disparagement
 an honourable gentleman whose
forebears have held the office he now holds for
many years 
by free choice the citizens perth
said the smith interrupting the speaker with
the tones his deep and decisive voice
ay surely said the disconcerted orator
by the voice the citizens how else i
pray you friend smith interrupt me not i
speak to our worthy and eldest bailie craigdallied
according to my poor mind i say that
come amongst us how he will still this sir patrick
charter is is a nobleman and hawks will
not pick hawks eyes out he may well bear
us out in a feud with the highlandmen and
do the part our provost and leader against
them but whether he that himself wears silk will
take our part against broidered cloak and cloth
 gold though he may do so against tartan and
irish frieze is something to be questioned take
a fool's advice we have saved our maiden 
whom i never meant to speak harm as truly i
knew none they have lost one man's hand
at least thanks to harry smith 
and to me added the little important
bonnetmaker
and to oliver proudfute as he tells us
continued the pottingar who contested no man's
claim to glory provided he was not himself
compelled to tread the perilous paths which lead
to it i say neighbours since they have left
a hand as a pledge they will never come in
couvrefew street again why in my simple mind
we were best to thank our stout townsman and
the town having the honour and these rakehells
the loss that we should hush the matter
up and say no more about it
these pacific counsels had their effect with
some the citizens who began to nod and
look exceedingly wise upon the advocate acquiescence
with whom notwithstanding the offence
so lately given simon glover seemed also
to agree in opinion but not so henry smith
who seeing the consultation at a stand took up
the speech in his usual downright manner
i am neither the oldest nor the richest
among you neighbours and i am not sorry
for it years will come if one lives to see
them and i can win and spend my penny like
another by the blaze the furnace and the
wind the bellows but no man ever saw me
sit down with wrong done in word or deed to
our fair town if man's tongue and man's hand
could right it neither will i sit down with
this outrage if i can help it i will go to the
provost myself if no one will go with me he
is a knight it is true and a gentleman free
and trueborn blood as we all know since
wallace's time who settled his greatgrandsire
amongst us but if he were the proudest nobleman
in the land he is the provost perth
and for his own honour must see the freedoms
and immunities the burgh preserved ay
and i know he will i have made a steel doug
i m
blet for him and have a good guess at the kind
 heart that it was meant to cover
surely said bailie craigdallie it would
be to no purpose to stir at court without sir
patrick charteris's countenance the ready answer
would be go to your provost you borrel
loons so neighbours and townsmen if you will
stand by my side i and our pottingar divining
will repair presently to kinfauns with sin
glover the jolly smith and gallant oliver
proudfute for witnesses to the onslaught and
speak with sir patrick charteris in name 
the fair town
nay said the peaceful man medicine
leave me behind i pray you i lack audacity
to speak before a belted knight
never regard that neighbour you must
go said bailie craigdallie the town hold
me a hotheaded carle for a man threescore 
sim glover is the offended party we all know
that harry gow spoils more harnesses with his
sword than he makes with his hammer and
our neighbour proudfute who take his own
word is at the beginning and every
fray in perth is course a man action wc
must have at least one advocate amongst us for
peace and quietness and thou pottingar must
be the man away with you sirs get your boots
and your beasts horse and mattock i say and
let us meet at the east port that is if it is
your pleasure neighbours to trust us with the
matter
there can be no better rede and we will
all avouch it said the citizens if the provost
take our part as the fair town hath a
right to expect we may bellthereat with the
best them
it is well then neighbours answered the
bailie so said so shall be done meanwhile
i have called the whole towncouncil together
about this hour and i have little doubt looking
around the company that as so many 
them who are in this place have resolved to
consult with our provost the rest will be compliant
to the same resolution and therefore
neighbours and good burghers the fair city
 perth horse and mattock as i said before
and meet me at the east port
a general acclamation concluded the sitting
 this species privy council or lords the
articles and they dispersed the deputation to
prepare for the journey and the rest to tell their
impatient wives and daughters the measures
they had taken to render their chambers safe in
future against the intrusion gallants at unseasonable
hours
while nags are saddling and the towncouncil
debating or rather putting in form what
the leading members their body had already
adopted it may be necessary for the information
 some readers to state in distinct terms
what is more circuitously intimated in the course
 the former discussion
it was the custom at this period when the
strength the feudal aristocracy controlled the
rights and frequently insulted the privileges 
the royal burghs scotland that the latter
where it was practicable often chose their provost
or chief magistrate not out the order
 the merchants shopkeepers and citizens who
inhabited the town itself and filled up the roll
 the ordinary magistracy but elected to that
preeminent state some powerful nobleman or
baron in the neighbourhood the burgh who
was expected to stand their friend at court in
such matters as concerned their common weal
and to lead their civic militia to fight whether
in general battle or in private feud reinforcing
them with his own feudal retainers this protection
was not always gratuitous the provosts
sometimes availed themselves their situation
to an unjustifiable degree and obtained grants
 lands and tenements belonging to the common
good or public property the burgh and
thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance
which they afforded others were satisfied
to receive the powerful aid the townsmen
in their own feudal quarrels with such
other marks respect and benevolence as the
burgh over which they presided were willing to
gratify them with in order to secure their active
services in case necessity the baron who
was the regular protector a royal burgh accepted
such freewill offerings without scruple
and repaid them by defending the rights the
town by arguments in the council and by bold
deeds in the field
the citizens the town or as they loved
better to call it the fair city perth had for
several generations found a protector and provost
 this kind in the knightly family charters
lords kinfauns in the neighbourhood
 the burgh it was scarce a century in the
time robert iii since the first this distinguished
family had settled in the strong castle
which now belonged to them with the picturesque
and fertile scenes adjoining to it but
the history the first settler chivalrous and
romantic in itself was calculated to facilitate
the settlement an alien in the land in which
his lot was cast we relate it as it is given by
an ancient and uniform tradition which carries
in it great indications truth and is warrant
enough perhaps for its insertion in graver histories
than the present
during the brief career the celebrated patriot
sir william wallace and when his arms
had for a time expelled the english invaders
from his native country he is said to have
undertaken a voyage to france with a small
band trusty friends to try what his presence

for he was respected through all countries for
his prowess might do to induce the french
monarch to send to scotland a body auxiliary
forces or other assistance to aid the scots
in regaining their independence
the scottish champion was on board a small
vessel and steering for the port dieppe
when a sail appeared in the distance which the
mariners regarded with doubt and apprehension
and at last with confusion and dismay wallace
demanded to know what was the cause their
alarm the captain the ship informed him
that the tall vessel which was bearing down
with the purpose boarding that which he
commanded was the ship a celebrated rover
equally famed for his courage strength body
and successful piracies it was commanded by
a gentleman named thomas de longueville a
frenchman by birth but by practice one 
those pirates who called themselves friends to
the sea and enemies to all who sailed upon that
element he attacked and plundered vessels 
all nations like one the ancient norse speaking
as they were termed whose dominion weapon
the mountain waves the master added
that no vessel could escape the rover hy flight
so speedy was the bark he commanded and that
no crew however hardy could hope to resist
him when as was his usual mode combat he
threw himself on board at the head his followers

wallace smiled sternly while the master 
the ship with alarm in his countenance and
tears in his eyes described to him the certainty
 their being captured by the red rover
a name given to de longueville because he
usually displayed the bloodred flag which he
had now hoisted
i will clear the narrow seas this rover
said wallace
then calling together some ten or twelve 
his own followers boyd kerlie seton and
others to whom the dust the most desperate
battle was like the breath life he commanded
them to arm themselves and lie flat upon
the deck so as to be out sight he ordered
the mariners below excepting such as were absolutely
necessary to manage the vessel and he
gave the master instructions upon pain death
so to steer as that while the vessel had an
appearance attempting to fly he should in
fact permit the red rover to come up with
them and do his worst wallace himself then
lay down on the deck that nothing might be
seen which could intimate any purpose resistance
in a quarter an hour de montreville's
vessel ran on board that the champion
and the red rover casting out grappling
irons to make sure his prize jumped
on the deck in complete armour followed
by his men who gave a terrible shout as if
victory had been already secured but the
armed scots started up at once and the rover
found himself unexpectedly engaged with
men accustomed to consider victory as secure
when they were only opposed as one to two or
three wallace himself rushed on the pirate
captain and a dreadful strife began betwixt
them with such fury that the others suspended
their own battle to look on and seemed by
common consent to refer the issue the strife
to the fate the combat between the two
chiefs the pirate fought as well as man could
do but wallace's strength was beyond that
 ordinary mortals he dashed the sword from
the rover's hand and placed him in such peril
that to avoid being cut down he was fain to
close with the scottish champion in hopes
 overpowering him in the grapple in this
also he was foiled they fell on the deck locked
in each other's arms but the frenchman fell undermost
 and wallace fixing his grasp upon his
gorget compressed it so closely notwithstanding
it was made the finest steel that the blood
gushed from his eyes nose and mouth and he
was only able to ask for quarter by signs his
men threw down their weapons and begged for
mercy when they saw their leader thus severely
handled the victor granted them all their
lives but took possession their vessel and
detained them prisoners
when he came in sight the french harbour
wallace alarmed the place by displaying
the rover's colours as if de longueville was
coming to pillage the town the bells were rung
backward horns were blown and the citizens
were hurrying to arms when the scene changed
the scottish lion on his shield gold was
raised above the piratical flag and announced
that the champion scotland was approaching
like a falcon with his prey in his clutch he
landed with his prisoner and carried him to the
court france where at wallace's request the
robberies which the pirate had committed were
forgiven and the king even conferred the honour
 knighthood on sir thomas de longueville
and offered to take him into his service but
the rover had contracted such a friendship for
his generous victor that he insisted on uniting
his fortunes with those wallace with whom
he returned to scotland and fought by his side
in many a bloody battle where the prowess 
sir thomas de longueville was remarked as
inferior to that none save his heroic conqueror
his fate also was more fortunate than
that his patron being distinguished by the
beauty as well as strength his person he
rendered himself so acceptable to a young lady
heiress the ancient family charteris that
she choose him lor her husband bestowing on
him with her hand the fair baronial castle 
kinfauns and the domains annexed to it their
descendants took the name charteris as connecting
themselves with their maternal ancestors
the ancient proprietors the property
though the name thomas de longueville was
equally honoured amongst them and the large
twohanded sword with which he mowed the
ranks war was and is still preserved among
the family muniments another account is
that the family name de longueville himself
was charteris the estate afterwards passed
to a family blairs and is now the property
 lord gray
these barons kinfauns from father to son
held for several generations the office provost
 perth the vicinity the castle and
town rendering it a very convenient arrangement
for mutual support the sir patrick 
this history had more than once led out the men
 perth to battles and skirmishes with the restless
highland depredators and with other enemies
foreign and domestic true it is he used
sometimes to be weary the slight and frivolous
complaints unnecessarily brought before
him and in which he was requested to interest
himself hence he had sometimes incurred the
charge being too proud as a nobleman or
too indolent as a man wealth and one who
was too much addicted to the pleasures the
field and the exercise feudal hospitality to
bestir himself upon all and every occasion when
the fair town would have desired his active interference
but notwithstanding that this occasioned
some slight murmuring the citizens
upon any serious cause alarm were wont to
rally around their provost and were warmly
supported by him both in council and action
chapter vii
the character and quality sir patrick
charteris the provost perth being such as
we have sketched in the last chapter let us now
return to the deputation which was in the act
 rendezvousing at the east port in order to
wait upon that dignitary with their complaints
at kinfauns
and first appeared simon glover on a pacing
palfrey which had sometimes enjoyed the
honour bearing the fairer person as well as the
lighter weight his beautiful daughter his
cloak was muffled round the lower part his
face as a sign to his friends not to interrupt him
by any questions while he passed through the
streets and partly perhaps on account the
coldness the weather the deepest anxiety
was seated on this brow as if the more he meditated
on the matter he was engaged in the
more difficult and perilous it appeared he
only greeted by silent gestures his friends as
they came to the rendezvous
a strong black horse the old galloway
breed an under size not exceeding fourteen
hands but high shouldered stronglimbed wellcoupled
and roundbarrelled bore to the east
port the gallant smith a judge the animal
might see in his eye a spark that vicious
temper which is frequently the accompaniment
 the form that is most vigorous and enduring 
but the weight the hand and the seat the
rider added to the late regular exercise a
long journey had subdued its stubbornness for
the present he was accompanied by the honest
bonnetmaker who being as the reader is
aware a little round man had planted himself
like a red pincushion for he was wrapped ina
scarlet cloak over which he had slung a hawking
pouch on the top a great saddle which
he might be said rather to be perched upon than
to bestride the saddle and the man were girthed
on the ridgebone a great trampling flemish
mare with a nose turned up in the air
like a camel a huge fleece hair at each foot
and every hoof full as large in circumference asa
fryingpan the contrast between the beast
and the rider was so extremely extraordinary
that whilst chance passengers contented themselves
with wondering how he got up his friends
were anticipating with sorrow the perils which
must attend his coming down again for the highseated
horseman's feet did not by any means
come beneath the laps the saddle he had
associated himself to the smith whose motions
he had watched for the purpose joining him 
for it was oliver proudfute's opinion that men
 action showed to most advantage when beside
each other and he was delighted when
some wag the lower class had gravity enough
to cry out without laughing outright there
goes the pride perth there go the slashing
craftsmen the jolly smith the wynd and
the bold bonnetmaker 
it is true the fellow who gave this allhail
thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces
like himself but as the bonnetmaker
did not see this byplay he generously threw
him a silver penny to encourage his respect for
martialists this munificence occasioned their
being followed by a crowd boys laughing
and hallooing until henry smith turning back
threatened to switch the foremost them a
resolution which they did not wait to see put
in execution
here are we the witnesses said the little
man on the large horse as they joined simon
glover at the east port but where are they
that should back us ah brother henry 
authority is a load for an ass rather than a spirited
horse it would but clog the motions 
such young fellows as you and me
i could well wish to see you bear ever so
little that same weight worthy master proudfate
replied henry gow u were it but to keep
you firm in the saddle for you bounce about as
if you were dancing a jig on your seat without
any help from your legs

ay ay i raise myself in my stirrups to

something perilous so jezabel and i part not

smith
ay isabel or jezabel all the same you
know but here comes bailie craigdallie at
last with that poor creeping cowardly creature
the pottingar they have brought two townofficers
with their partizans to guard their fair
persons i suppose if there is one thing i hate
more than another it is such a sneaking varlet
as that dwining 
have a care he does not hear you say so
said the smith i tell thee bonnetmaker that
there is more danger in yonder slight wasted
anatomy than in twenty stout fellows like yourself

pshaw bully smith you are but jesting
with me said oliver softening his voice however
and looking towards the pottingar as if
to discover in what limb or lineament his
wasted face and form lay any appearance the
menaced danger and his examination reassuring
him he answered boldly blades and
bucklers man i would stand the feud a
dozen such as dwining what could he do to
any man with blood in his veins 
he could give him a dose physic answered
the smith drily
they had no time for further colloquy for
bailie craigdallie called to them to take the road
to kin fauns and himself showed the example
as they advanced at a leisurely pace the discourse
turned on the reception which they were
to expect from their provost and the interest
which he was likely to take in the aggression
which they complained the glover seemed
particularly desponding and talked more than
once in a manner which implied a wish that
they would yet consent to let the matter rest
he did not speak out very plainly however
fearful perhaps the malignant interpretation
which might be derived from any appearance 
his flinching from the assertion his daughter's
reputation dwining seemed to agree with
him in opinion but spoke more cautiously than
in the morning
after all said the bailie when i think
 all the provinces and good gifts which have
passed from the good town to my lord provost's
i cannot think he will be backward to
show himself more than one lusty boat laden
with bordeaux wine has left the south shore
to discharge its burden under the castle 
kinfauns i have some right to speak that
who was the merchant importer
and said dwining with his squeaking
voice i could speak delicate confections
curious comfits loaves waste bread and
even cakes that rare and delicious condiment
which men call sugar that have gone thitherto
help out a bridal banquet or a listening
feast or such like but alack bailie craigdallied
wine is drunk comfits are eaten and
the gift is forgotten when the flavour is past
away alas neighbour the banquet last
christmas is gone like the last year's snow
but there have been gloves full gold
pieces said the magistrate
i should know that who wrought them

said simon whose professional recollections
still mingled with whatever else might occupy
his mind one was a hawking glove for my
lady i made it something wide her ladyship
found no fault in consideration the intended
lining
well go to said bailie craigdallie the
less i lie and if these are not to the fore it is
the provost's fault and not the town's they
could neither be eat nor drunk in the shape in
which he got them
i could speak a brave armour too
said the smith but cogcm na schie as john
highlands says i think the knight kinfauns
will do his devoir by the burgh in peace
or war and it is needless to be reckoning the
town's good deeds till we see him thankless for
them
so say i cried our friend proudfute from
the top bis mare we fostering blades
never bear so base a mind as to count for wine
and walnuts with a friend like sir patrick charters
nay trust me a good woodsman like
sir patrick will prize the right hunting and
sporting over the lands the burgh as an high
privilege and one which his majesty the king's
grace excepted is neither granted to lord nor
loon save to our provost alone
as the bonnetmaker spoke there was heard
on the left hand the cry so so ivaiv waw
haw being the shout a falconer to his
hawk
methinks yonder is a fellow using the privilege
you mention who from his appearance is
neither king nor provost said the smith
ay marry i see him said the bonnetmaker
who imagined the occasion presented a
prime occasion to win honour thou and i
jolly smith will prick towards him and put
him to the question
have with you then cried the smith 
and his companion spurred his mare and went
off never doubting that gow was at his heels
but craigdallie caught henry's horse by the
reins stand fast by the standard he said 
let us see the luck our light horseman if
he procures himself a broken pate he will be
quieter for the rest the day
from what i already see said the smith
he may easily come by such a boon yonder
fellow who stops so impudently to look at us
as if he were engaged in the most lawful sport
in the world i guess him by his trotting nobler
his rusty headpiece with the cock's feather
and long twohanded sword to be the follower
 some the southland lords men who
live so near the southron that the black jack
is never off their backs and who are as free 
their blows as they are light in their fingers
whilst they were thus speculating on the
issue the rencounter the valiant bonnetmaker
began to pull up jezabel in order that the
smith who he still concluded was close behind
might overtake him and either advance
first or at least abreast himself but when
he saw him at a hundred yards distance standing
composedly with the rest the group
the flesh the champion like that the old
spanish general began to tremble in anticipation
 the dangers into which his own venturous
spirit was about to involve it yet the consciousness
 being countenanced by the neighbourhood
 so many friends the hopes that the
appearance such odds must intimidate the
single intruder and the shame abandoning
an enterprise in which he had volunteered and
when so many persons must witness his disgrace
surmounted the strong inclination which
prompted him to wheel jezabel to the right
about and return to the friends whose protection
he had quitted as fast as her legs could
carry them he accordingly continued his direction
towards the stranger who increased his
alarm considerably by putting his little nag in
motion and riding to meet him at a brisk trot
on observing this apparently offensive movement
our hero looked over his left shoulder
more than once as if reconnoitring the ground
for a retreat and in the meanwhile came to a
decided halt but the philistine was upon him
ere the bonnetmaker could decide whether to
fight or fly and a very ominouslooking philistine
he was his figure was gaunt and lathy
his visage marked by two or three illfavoured
scars and the whole man had much the air
 one accustomed to say stand and deliver
to a true man
this individual began the discourse by exclaiming
in tones as sinister as his looks 
the devil catch you for a cuckoo why do you
ride across the moor to spoil my sport 
worthy stranger said our friend in the
tone pacific remonstrance i am oliver
proudfute a burgess perth and a man 
substance and yonder is the worshipful adam
craigdallie the oldest bailie the burgh with
the fighting smith the wynd and three or
four armed men more who desire to know your
name and how you come to take your pleasure
over these lands belonging to the burgh 
perth although natheless i will answer for
them it is not their wish to quarrel with a
gentleman or stranger for any accidental trespass
 only it is their use and wont not to grant
such leave unless it is duly asked and and
therefore i desire to know your name worthy
sir
the grim and loathly aspect with which the
falconer had regarded oliver proudfute during
his harangue had greatly disconcerted him and
altogether altered the character the inquiry
which with henry gow to back him he would
probably have thought most fitting for the occasion

the stranger replied to it modified as it was
with a most inauspicious grin which the scars
 his visage made appear still more repulsive
you want to know my name my name is
the devil's dick hogarth well known in
annandale for a gentle johnstonee i follow the
stout laird wamphray who rides with his
kinsman the redoubled lord johnstonee who
is banded with the doughty earl douglas 
and the earl and the lord and the laird and i
the esquire fly our hawks where we find our
game and ask no man whose ground we ride
over
m i will do your message sir replied oliver
proudfute meekly enough for he began to be
very desirous to get free the embassy which
he had so rashly undertaken and was in the
act turning his horse's head when the anmandate
man added 
and take you this to boot to keep you in
mind that you met the devil's dick and to teach
you another time to beware how you spoil the
sport any one who wears the flying spur on
his shoulder
with these words he applied two or three
smart blows his ridingrod upon the luckless
bonnetmaker's head and person some them
lighted upon jezabel who turning sharply
round laid her rider upon the moor and galloped
back towards the party citizens
proudfute thus overthrown began to cry for
assistance in no very manly voice and almost in
the same breath to whimper for mercy for his
antagonist dismounting almost as soon as he
fell offered a linger or large wood knife to
his throat while he rifled the pockets the unlucky
citizen and even examined his hawking
bag swearing two or three grisly oaths that he
would have what it contained since the wearer
had interrupted his sport he pulled the belt
rudely off terrifying the prostrate bonnetmaker
still more by the regardless violence which he
used as instead taking the pains to unbuckle
the strap he drew till the fastening gave way
but apparently it contained nothing to his mind
he threw it carelessly from him and at the same
time suffered the dismounted cavalier to rise
while he himself remounted his hobbler and
looked towards the rest oliver's party who
were now advancing
when they had seen their delegate overthrown
there was some laughter so much had
the vaunting humour the bonnetmaker prepared
his friends to rejoice when as henry
smith termed it they saw their oliver meet
with a rowland but when the bonnetmaker's
adversary was seen to bestride him and handle
him in the manner described the armourer could
hold out no longer please you good master
bailie i cannot endure to see our townsman
beaten and rifled and like to be murdered before
us all it reflects upon the fair town and if
it is neighbour proudfute's misfortune it is our
shame i must to his rescue
we will all go to his rescue answered
bailie craigdallie but let no man strike without
order from me we have more feuds on
our hands it is to be feared than we have
strength to bring to good and therefore i
charge you all more especially you henry the
wynd in the name the fair city that you
make no stroke but in selfdefence they all
advanced therefore in a body and the appearance
 such a number drove the plunderer from
his booty he stood at gaze however at some
distance like the wolf which though it retreats
before the dogs cannot be brought to absolute
flight
henry seeing this state things spurred his
horse and advanced far before the rest the
party up towards the scene oliver proudfate's
misfortune his first task was to catch
jezabel by the flowing rein and his next to lead
her to meet her discomfited master who was
crippling towards him his clothes much soiled
with his fall his eyes streaming with tears from
pain as well as mortification and altogether exhibiting
an aspect so unlike the spruce and dapper
importance his ordinary appearance that
the honest smith felt compassion for the little
man and some remorse at having left lii exposed
to such disgrace all men i believe enjoy
an illnatured joke the difference is that
an illnatured person can drink out to very
dregs the amusement which it affords while
the bettermoulded mind soon loses the sense 
the ridiculous in sympathy for the pain the
sufferer
u let me pitch you up to your saddle again
neighbour said the smith dismounting at the
same time and assisting oliver to scramble into
his warsaddle as a monkey might have done
may god forgive you neighbour smith for
not backing me i would not have believed
in it though fifty credible witnesses had sworn
it you
such were the first words spoken in sorrow
more than anger by which the dismayed oliver
vented his feelings
the bailie kept hold my horse by the
bridle and besides henry continued with a
smile which even his compassion could not suppress
 i thought you would have accused me
 diminishing your honour if i brought you
 k
aid against a single man but cheer up the villain
took foul odds you your horse not being
well at command
that is true that is true said oliver
eagerly catching at the apology
and yonder stands the faitour rejoicing at
the mischief he has done and triumphing in
your overthrow like the king in the romance
who played upon the fiddle whilst a city was
burning come thou with me and thou shalt
see how we will handle him nay fear not
that i will desert thee this time
so saying he caught jezabel by the rein
and galloping alongside her without giving
oliver time to express a negative he rushed
toward the devil's dick who had halted on
the top a rising ground at some distance
the gentle johnstonee however either that he
thought the contest unequal or that he had
fought enough for the day snapping his fingers
and throwing his hand out with an air defiance
spurred his horse into a neighbouring
bog through which he seemed to flutter like a
wild duck swinging his lure round his head
and whistling to his hawk all the while though
any other horse and rider must have been instantly
bogged up to the saddlegirths
there goes a thoroughbred mosstrooper
said the smith that fellow will fight or flee
as suits his humour and there is no use to pursue
him any more than to hunt a wild goose
he has got your purse i doulvt me for they
seldom leave off till they are full handed
ye ye yes said proudfute in a melancholy
tone he has got my purse but
there is less matter since he hath left the 

nay the hawkingbag had been an emblem
 personal victory to be sure a trophy
as the minstrels call it
there is more in it than that friend said
oliver significantly
why that is well neighbour i love to
hear you speak in your own scholarly tone
again cheer up you have seen the villain's
back and regained the trophies you had lost
when taken at advantage
ah henry gow henry gow said the
bonnetmaker and stopped short vvitli a deep
sigh nearly amounting to a groan
what is the matter asked his friend
what is it you vex yourself about now 
i have some suspicion my dearest friend
henry smith that the villain fled for fear 
you not me i
do not think so replied the armourer 
he saw two men and fled and who can tell
whether he fled for one or the other besides
he knows by experience your strength and activity
 we all saw how you kicked and struggled
when you were on the ground
did i said poor proudfute i do not
remember it but i know it is my best point 
i am a strong dog in the loins but did they
all see it
all as much as i said the smith smothering
an inclination to laughter
but thou wilt remind them it 
be assured i will answered henry and
 thy desperate rally even now mark what
i say to bailie craigdallie and make the best
 it
vol 
it is not that i require any evidence in my
favour for i am as brave by nature as most
men in perth but only here the man 
valour paused
but only what inquired the stout armourer

but only i am afraid being killed to
leave my pretty wife and my young family you
know would be a sad change smith you will
know this when it is your own case and will
feel abated in courage
it is like that i may said the armourer
musing
then i am so accustomed to the use 
arms and so well breathed that few men can
match me it's all here said the little man
expanding his breast like a trussed fowl and
patting himself with his hands here is room
for all the wind machinery
i dare say you are longbreathed longwinded
 at least your speech betrays 
my speech you are a wag but i have
got the stern post a diamond brought up the
river from dundee
the stern post a drummond exclaimed
the armourer conscience man it will put
you in feud with the whole clan not the least
wrathful in the country as i take it
st andrew man you put me out i
mean a diamond that is a large ship i have
fixed this post in my yard and had it painted
and carved something like a soldan or saracen
and with him i breathe myself and will wield
my twohanded sword against him thrust or
point for an hour together
that must make you familiar with the use
 your weapon said the smith
ay marry does it and sometimes i will
place you a bonnet an old one most likely on
my soldan's head and cleave it with such a
downright blow that in troth the infidel has
but little his skull remaining to hit at
that is unlucky for you will lose your
practice said henry but how say you
bonnetmaker i will put on my headpiece
and corslet one day and you shall hew at me
allowing me my broadsword to parry and pay
back eh what say you 
by no manner means my dear friend
i should do you too much evil besides to tell
you the truth i strike far more freely at a helmet
or bonnet when it is set on my wooden
soldan then i am sure to fetch it down but
when there is a plume feathers in it that nod
and two eyes gleaming fiercely from under the
shadow the visor and when the whole is
dancing about here and there i acknowledge it
puts out my hand fence
so if men would but stand stock still like
your soldan you would play the tyrant with
them master proudfute 
in time and with practice i conclude i
might answered oliver but here we come
up with the rest them bailie craigdallie
looks angry but it is not his kind anger
that frightens me
you are to recollect gentle reader that as
soon as the bailie and those who attended
him saw that the smith had come up to the
forlorn bonnetmaker and that the stranger
had retreated they gave themselves no trouble
about advancing further to his assistance which
they regarded as quite insured by the presence
 the redoubled henry gow they had resumed
their straight road to kinfauns desirous
that nothing should delay the execution their
mission as some time had elapsed ere the 
and the smith rejoined the party
bailie craigdallie asked them and henry smith
in particular what they meant by dallying away
precious time by riding up hill after the falconer
by the mass it was not my fault master
bailie replied the smith if ye will couple
up an ordinary lowcountry greyhound with a
highland wolfdog you must not blame the first
 them for taking the direction in which it
pleases the last to drag him on it was so and
not otherwise with my neighbour oliver proudfate
he no sooner got up from the ground but
he mounted his mare like a flash lightning
and enraged at the unsightly advantage which
yonder rascal had taken his stumbling horse
he flew after him like a dromedary i could not
but follow both to prevent a second stumble and
secure our over bold friend and champion from
the chance some ambush at the top the
bill but the villain who is a follower some
lord the marches and wears a winged spur
for his cognizance fled from our neighbour like
fire from flint
the senior bailie perth listened with surprise
to the legend which it had pleased gow
to circulate for though not much caring for
the matter he had always doubted the bonnetmaker's
romancing account his own exploits
which hereafter he must hold as in some degree
orthodox the shrewd old glover looked closer
into the matter
you will drive the poor bonnetmaker
mad he whispered to henry and set him
aringing his clapper as if he were a townbell
on a rejoicing day when for order and decency
it were better he were silent
o by our lady father replied the smith
i love the poor little braggadocio and could
not think his sitting rueful and silent in
the provost's hall while all the rest them
and in especial that venomous pottingar were
telling their mind
thou art even too goodnatured a fellow
henry answered simon but mark the
difference betwixt these two men the harmless
little bonnetmaker assumes the airs a
dragon to disguise his natural cowardice while
the pottingar wilfully desires to show himself
timid poorspirited and humble to conceal the
danger his temper the adder is not the
less deadly that he creeps under a stone i tell
thee son henry that for all his sneaking looks
and timorous talking this wretched anatomy
loves mischief more than he fears danger 
but here we stand in front the provost's
castle and a lordly place is kinfauns and a
credit to the city it is to have the owner 
such a gallant castle for their chief magistrate
a goodly fortalice indeed said the smith
looking at the broad winding tay s it swept
under the bank on which the castle stood like
its modern successor and seemed the queen 
the valley although on the opposite side the
river the strong walls echo appeared to
dispute the preeminence echo however was
i n that age a peaceful nunnery and the walls
with which it was surrounded were the barriers
 secluded vestal not the bulwarks 
an armed garrison tis a brave castle said
the armourer again looking at the towers 
kinfauns and the breastplate and target 
the bonnie course the tay it were worth
lipping a good blade before wrong were offered
to it
the porter kinfauns who knew from a
distance the persons and characters the party
had already opened the courtyard gate for
their entrance and sent notice to sir patrick
charteris that the eldest bailie perth with
some other good citizens were approaching the
castle the good knight who was getting ready
for a hawking party heard the intimation
with pretty much the same feelings that the
modern representative a burgh hears the
menaced visitation a party his worthy
electors at a time rather unseasonable for their
reception that is he internally devoted the
intruders to mahound and termagant and
outwardly gave orders to receive them with all
lipping e making notches in a sword or knife
decorum and civility commanded the sewers to
bring hot venison steaks and cold baked meats
into the knightly ball with all dispatch and the
butler to broach bis casks and do his duty 
for if the fair city perth sometimes filled his
cellar her citizens were always equally ready
to assist at emptying his flagons
the good burghers were reverently marshalled
into the hall where the knight who
was in a ridinghabit and booted up to the
middle bis thighs received them with a
mixture courtesy and patronizing condescension
 wishing them all the while at the bottom
 the tay on account the interruption
their arrival gave to his proposed amusement
 the morning he met them in the midst 
the ball with bare head and bonnet in hand and
some such salutation as the following u ha
my master eldest bailie and you worthy simon
glover fathers the fair city and you my
learned pottingar and you stout smith 
and my slashing bonnetmaker too who cracks
more skulls than he covers how come i to have
the pleasure seeing so many friends so early 
i was thinking to see my hawks fly and your
company will make the sport more pleasant 
aside i trust in our lady they may break
their necks that is always unless the city
have any commands to lay on me butler gilbert
dispatch thou knave but i hope you
have no more grave errand than to try if the
malvoisie holds its flavour 
the city delegates answered to their provost's
civilities by inclinations and confess
more or less characteristic which the s
bow was the lowest and the smith's
the least ceremonious probably he knew his
own value as a fighting man upon occasion
to the general compliment the elder bailie replied

sir patrick charteris and our noble lord
provost said craigdallie gravely had our
errand been to enjoy the hospitality with which
we have been often regaled here our manners
would have taught us to tarry till your lordship
had invited us as on other occasions and
as to hawking we have had enough on't for
one morning since a wild fellow who was flying
a falcon hard by on the moor unhorsed and
cudgelled our worthy friend oliver bonnetmaker
or proudfute as some men call him
merely because he questioned him in your honour's
name and the town perth's who or
what he was that took so much upon him
and what account gave he himself
said the provost by st john i will teach
him to forestall my sport l
so please your lordship said the bonnetmaker
 he did take me at disadvantage but
i got on horseback again afterwards and
pricked after him gallantly he calls himself
richard the devil
how man he that the rhymes and romances
are made on said the provost i
thought that smack's name had been robert
i trow they be different my lord i only
graced this fellow with the full title for indeed
he called himself the devil's dick and said he
was a johnstonee and a follower the lord 
that name but i put him back into the bog
and recovered my hawking bag which he had
taken when i was at disadvantage
j
sir patrick paused for an instant we
have heard said he the lord johnstonee
and his followers little is to be had by
meddling with them smith tell me did you
endure this 
ay faith did i sir patrick having command
from my betters not to help
well if thou satst down with it said the
provost i see not why we should rise up 
especially as master oliver proudfute though
taken at advantage at first has as he has told us
recovered his reputation and that the burgh
but here comes the wine at length fill round
to my good friends and guests till the wine leap
over the cup prosperity to st johnston and
a merry welcome to you all my honest friends 
and now sit you to eat a morsel for the sun is
high up and it must be long since you thrifty
men have broken your fast
before we eat my lord provost said the
bailie let us tell you the pressing cause 
our coming which as yet we have not touched
upon
nay prithee bailie said the provost
put it off till thou hast eaten some complaint
against the rascally jackie and retainers 
the nobles for playing at football on the streets
 the burgh or some such goodly matter
no my lord said craigdallie stoutly and
firmly it is the jackets masters whom
we complain for playing at football with the
honour our families and using as little ceremony
with our daughters sleeping chambers as
if they were in a border at paris a party 
reiving nightwalkers courtiers and men 
rank as there is but too much reason to believe
attempted to scale the windows simon
glover's house last night they stood in their
defence with drawn weapons when they were
interrupted by henry smith and fought till
they were driven off by the rising the citizens

how said sir patrick setting down the
cup which he was about to raise to his head
cocksbody make that manifest to me and by
the soul thomas louisville i will see
you righted with my best power were it to cost
me life and land who attests this simon
glover you arc held an honest and a cautious

man do you take the truth this charge upon
your conscience 
my lord said simon understand i am
no willing complainer in this weighty matter
no damage has arisen save to the breakers 
the peace themselves i fear only great power
could have encouraged such lawless audacity 
and i were unwilling to put feud between my
native town and some powerful nobleman on
my account but it has been said that if i
hang back in prosecuting this complaint it will
be as much as admitting that my daughter expected
such a visit which is a direct falsehood
therefore my lord i will tell your lordship
what happened so far as i know and leave
further proceeding to your wisdom he then
told from point to point all that he had seen 
the attack
sir patrick charteris listening with much
attention seemed particularly struck with the
escape the man who had been made prisoner
strange he said that you did not secure
him when you had him did you not look at
him so as to know him again 
i had but the light a lantern my lord
provost and as to suffering him to escape i was
alone said the glover and old but yet i
might have kept him had i not heard my
daughter shriek in the upper room and ere i
had returned from her chamber the man had
escaped through the garden
now armourer as a true man and a good
soldier said sir patrick tell me what you
know this matter
henry gow in his own decided style gave
a brief but clear narrative the whole affair
honest proudfute being next called upon
began his statement with an air more importance
 touching this awful and astounding
tumult within the burgh i cannot altogether
it is true say with henry gow that i saw
the very beginning but it will not be denied
that i beheld a great part the latter 
and especially that i procured the evidence most
effectual to convict the knaves
and what is it man said sir patrick
charteris never lose time fumbling and
prating about it what is it 
i have brought your lordship in this pouch
what one the rogues left behind him said
the little man it is a trophy which in good
faith and honest truth i do confess i won not
by the blade but i claim the credit securing
it with that presence mind which few men
possess amidst flashing torches and clashing weapons
i secured it my lord and here it is
so saying he produced from the hawking
pouch already mentioned the stiffened hand
which had been found on the scene the skirmish

nay bonnetmaker said the provost
i'll warrant thee man enough to secure a
rogue's hand after it is cut from the body 
what do you look so busily for in your bag 
there should have been there was a ring
my lord which was on the knave's finger i
fear i have been forgetful and left it at home
for i took it off to show to my wife as she cared
not to look upon the dead hand as women love
not such sights but yet i thought i had put it
on the finger again nevertheless it must i
bethink me be at home i will ride back for it
and henry smith will trot along with me
we will all trot with thee said sir patrick
charteris since i am for perth myself
look you honest burghers and good neighbours
 perth you may have thought me unapt
to be moved by light complaints and trivial
breaches your privileges such as small trespasses
on your game the barons followers playing
football in the street and such like but
by the soul thomas longueville you shall
not find patrick charteris slothful in a matter
 this importance this hand he continued
holding up the severed joint belongs to one
who hath worked no drudgery we will put it
in a way to be known and claimed the owner
if his comrades the revel have but one spark
 honour in them hark you gerard get
me some halfscore good men instantly to
horse and let them take jack and spear meanwhile
neighbours if feud arise out this as is
most likely we must come to each other's support
if my poor house be attacked how many
men will you bring to my support 
the burghers looked at henry gow to whom
vol i p
they instinctively turned when such matters
were discussed i will answer said he for
fifty good fellows to be assembled ere the common
bell has rung ten minutes for a thousand
in the space an hour
it is well answered the gallant provost 
and in the case need i will come to aid the
fair city with such men as i can make and
now good friends let us to horse
chapter vin
it was early in the afternoon st valentine's
day that the prior the dominicans was engaged
in discharge his duties as confessor to
a penitent no small importance this was an
elderly man a goodly presence a florid and
healthful cheek the under part which was
shaded by a venerable white beard which descended
over his bosom the large and clear blue
eyes with the broad expanse brow expressed
dignity but it was a character which seemed
more accustomed to receive honours voluntarily
paid than to enforce them when they were refused
the goodnature the expression was
so great as to approach to defenceless simplicity
or weakness character unfit it might be
inferred to repel intrusion or subdue resistance
amongst the grey locks this personage
was placed a small circlet or coronet gold
upon a blue fillet his beads which were large
and conspicuous were native gold rudelyenough
wrought but ornamented with scottish
pearls rare size and beauty these were
his only ornaments and a long crimson robe 
silk tied by a sash the same colour formed
his attire his shrift being finished he arose
heavily from the embroidered cushion upon
which he kneeled during his confession and by
the assistance a crutchheaded staff ebony
moved lame and ungracefully and with apparent
pain to a chair state which surmounted
by a canopy was placed for his accommodation
by the chimney the lofty and large apartment

this was robert third the name and the
second the illfated family stewart who filled
the throne scotland he had many virtues
and was not without talent but it was his great
misfortune that like others his devoted line
his merits were not a kind suited to the part
which he was called upon to perform in life
the king so fierce a people as the scots then
were ought to have been warlike prompt and
active liberal in rewarding services strict in
punishing crimes one whose conduct should
make him feared as well as beloved the qualities
 robert the third were the reverse 
all these in youth he had indeed seen battles 
but without incurring disgrace he had never
manifested the chivalrous love war and peril
or the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerous
achievements which in that age was expected
from all who were noble birth and
had claims to authority
besides his military career was very short
amidst the tumult a tournament the young
earl carrick such was then his title received
a kick from the horse sir james douglas
 dalkeith in consequence which he was
lame for the rest his life and absolutely disabled
from taking share either in warfare or in
the military sports and tournaments which were
its image as robert had never testified m such
predilection for violent exertion he did not probably
much regret the incapacities which exempted
him from these active scenes but his
misfortune or rather its consequences lowered
him in the eyes a fierce nobility and warlike
people he was obliged to repose the principal
charge his affairs now in one member now in
another his family sometimes with the actual
rank and always with the power lieutenantgeneral
 the kingdom his paternal affection
would have induced him to use the assistance
 his eldest son a young man spirit and talent
whom in fondness he had created duke 
rothsay in order to give him the present possession
 a dignity next to that the throne
but the young prince's head was too giddy and
his hand too feeble to wield with dignity the
delegated sceptre however fond power
pleasure was the prince's favourite pursuit 
and the court was disturbed and the country
scandalized by the number fugitive amours
and extravagant revels practised by him who
should have set an example order and regularity
to the youth the kingdom
the license and impropriety the duke 
rothsay's conduct was the more reprehensible
in the public view that he was a married person
 although some over whom his youth gaiety
grace and good temper had obtained influence
were opinion that an excuse for his
libertinism might be found in the circumstances
 the marriage itself they reminded each other
that his nuptials were entirely conducted by his
uncle the duke albany by whose counsels
the infirm and timid king was much governed
at the time and who had the character managing
the temper his brother and sovereign
so as might be most injurious to the interests
and prospects the young heir by albany's
machinations the hand the heir apparent was
in a manner put up to sale as it was understood
publicly that the nobleman in scotland
who should give the largest dower to his daughter
might aspire to raise her to the bed the
duke rothsay
in the contest for preference which ensued
george earl dunbar and march who possessed
by himself or his vassals a great part 
the eastern frontier was preferred to other competitors
 and his daughter was with the mutual
good will the young couple actually contracted
to the duke rothsay
but there remained a third party to be consulted
and that was no other than the tremendous
archibald earl douglas terrible alike
from the extent his lands from the offices
and jurisdictions with which he was invested
and from his personal qualities wisdom and
valour mingled with indomitable pride and
more than the feudal love vengeance the
earl was also nearly related to the throne having
married the eldest daughter the reigning
monarch
after the espousals the duke rothsay
with the earl march's daughter douglas as
if he had postponed his share in the negotiation
to show that it could not be concluded with anyone
but himself entered the lists to break off
the contract he made a larger offer with his
daughter marjory than the earl march had
proffered and secured by his own cupidity and
fear the douglas albany exerted his influence
with the timid monarch till he was prevailed
upon to break the contract with the earl 
march and wed his son to marjory douglas a
woman whom he could not love no apology
was offered to the earl march excepting that
the espousals betwixt the prince and elizabeth
 dunbar had not been approved by the states
 parliament and that till such ratification
the contract was liable to be broken off the
earl deeply resented the wrong done to himself
and his daughter and was generally understood
to study revenge which his great influence on
the english frontier was likely to place within
his power
in the meantime the duke rothsay incensed
at the sacrifice his hand and his inclinations
to this stateintrigue took his own mode
 venting his displeasure by neglecting his
wife contemning his formidable and dangerous
fatherinlaw and showing little respect to the
authority the king himself and none whatever
to the remonstrances albany his uncle
whom he looked upon as his confirmed enemy
amid these internal dissensions his family
which extended themselves through his councils
and administration introducing everywhere
a
the baneful effects uncertainty and disunion
the feeble monarch had for some time been
supported by the counsels his queen arabella
a daughter the noble house drummond
gifted with a depth sagacity and firmness
 mind which exercised some restraint
over the levities a son who respected her and
sustained on many occasions the wavering resolution
 her royal husband but after her
death the imbecile sovereign resembled nothing
so much as a vessel drifted from her anchors
and tossed about amidst contending currents
abstractedly considered robert might be said
to doat upon his son to entertain respect and
awe for the character his brother albany so
much more decisive than his own to fear the
douglas with a terror which was almost instinctive
and to suspect the constancy the
bold but fickle earl march but his feelings
towards these various characters were so mixed
and complicated that from time to time they
showed entirely different from what they really
were and according to the interest which
had been last exerted over his flexible mind
the king would change from an indulgent to
a strict and even cruel father from a confiding
to a jealous brother or from a benignant
and bountiful to a grasping and encroaching
sovereign like the cameleon his feeble mind
reflected the colour that firmer character
upon which at the time he reposed for counsel
and assistance and when he disused the
advice one his family and employed the
counsel another it was no unwonted thing
to see a total change measures equally disrespectable
to the character the king and dangerous
to the safety the state
it followed as a matter course that the
clergy the catholic church acquired influence
over a man whose intentions were so excellent
but whose resolutions were so infirm robert
was haunted not only with a due sense the
errors he had really committed but with the
tormenting apprehensions those peccadilloes
which beset a superstitious and timid mind it
is scarcely necessary therefore to add that the
churchmen various descriptions had no small
influence over this easytempered prince though
indeed theirs was at that period an influence
from which few or none escaped however resolute
and firm purpose in affairs a temporal
character we now return from this long digression
without which what we have to relate
could not perhaps have been well understood

the king had moved with ungraceful difficulty
to the cushioned chair which under a
state or canopy stood prepared for his accommodation
and upon which he sank down with enjoyment
like an indolent man who had been
for some time confined to a constrained position
when seated the gentle and venerable
looks the good old man showed benevolence
the prior who now remained standing opposite
to the royal seat with an air deep deference
which cloaked the natural haughtiness
 his carriage was a man betwixt forty and
fifty years age but every one whose hairs
still retained their natural dark colour acute
features and a penetrating look attested the
talents by which the venerable father had acquired
his high station in the community over
which he presided and we may add in the
councils the kingdom in whose service they
were often exercised the chief objects which
his education and habits taught him to keep in
view were the extension the dominion and
the wealth the church and the suppression
 heresy both which he endeavoured to accomplish
by all the means which his situation
afforded him but he honoured his religion by
the sincerity his own belief and by the morality
which guided his conduct in all ordinary
situations the faults the prior anselm
though they led him into grievous error and
even cruelty were perhaps rather those his
age and profession his virtues were his own
these things done said the king and
the lands i have mentioned secured by my
gift to this monastery you are opinion father
that i stand as much in the good graces
 our holy mother church as to term myself
her dutiful son 
surely my liege said the prior would
to god that all her children brought to the efficacious
sacrament confession as deep a
sense their errors and as much will to make
amends for them but i speak these comforting
words my liege not to robert king 
scotland but only to my humble and devout
penitent robert stewart carrick
you surprise me father answered the
king i have little check on my conscience
for aught that i have done in my kingly office
seeing that i use therein less mine own opinion
than the advice the most wise counsellors

even therein lieth the danger my liege
replied the prior the holy father recognises
in your grace in every thought word
and action an obedient vassal the holy
church but there are perverse counsellors
who obey the instinct their wicked hearts
while they abuse the goodnature and ductility
 their monarch and under colour serving
his temporal interests take steps which are prejudicial
to those that last to eternity
king robert raised himself upright in his
chair and assumed an air authority which
though it well became him he did not usually
display
prior anselm he said if you have discovered
anything in my conduct whether as a
king or a private individual which may call
down such censures as your words intimate it
is your duty to speak plainly and i command
you to do so
my liege you shall be obeyed answered
the prior with an inclination the body
then raising himself up and assuming the
dignity his rank in the church he said
hear from me the words our holy father
the pope the successor st peter to whom
have descended the keys both to bind and to
unloose wherefore o robert scotland
hast thou not received into the see st andrews
robert wardle whom the pontiff
hath recommended to fill that see why dost
thou make profession with thy lips dutiful
service to the church when thy actions proclaim
the depravity and disobedience thy
inward soul obedience is better than sacrifices

sir prior said the monarch bearing himself
in a manner not unbecoming his loftyrank
 we may well dispense with answering
you upon this subject being a matter which
concerns us and the estates our kingdom
but does not affect our private conscience
alas said the prior and whose conscience
will it concern at the last day which
 your belted lords or wealthy burgesses will
then step between their king and the penalty
which he has incurred by following their
secular policy in matters ecclesiastical know
mighty king that were all the chivalry thy
realm drawn up to shield thee from the red
levin bolt they would be consumed like scorched
parchment before the blaze a furnace
good father prior said the king on
whose timorous conscience this kind language
seldom failed to make an impression
you surely argue over rigidly in this matter
it was during my last indisposition while the
earl douglas held as lieutenantgeneral
the regal authority in scotland that the obstruction
to the reception the primate unhappily
arose do not therefore tax me with
what happened when i was unable to conduct
the affairs the kingdom and compelled to
delegate my power to another
to your subject sire you have said
enough replied the prior but if the impediment
arose during the lieutenancy the
earl douglas the legate his holiness will
demand wherefore it has not been instantly
removed when the king resumed in his royal
hands the reins authority the black douglas
can do much more perhaps than a subject
should have power to do in the kingdom his
sovereign but he cannot stand betwixt your
grace and your own conscience or release you
from the duties to the holy church which your
situation as a king imposes upon you
father said robert somewhat impatiently
 you are over peremptory in this matter
and ought at least to wait a reasonable season
vol i o
until we have time to consider some remedy
such disputes have happened repeatedly in the
reigns our predecessors and our royal and
blessed ancestor saint david did not resign
his privileges as a monarch without making a
stand in their defence even though he was involved
in arguments with the holy father himself

and therein was that great and good king
neither holy nor saintly said the prior and
therefore was he given to be a rout and a
spoil to his enemies when he raised his sword
against the banners st peter and st paul
and st john beverley in the war as it is
still called the standard well was it for
him that like his namesake the son jesse
his sin was punished upon earth and not entered
against him at the long and dire day 
accounting
well good prior well enough this
for the present the holy see shall god
willing have no reason to complain me i
take our lady to witness i would not for the
crown i wear take the burden wronging
our mother church we have ever feared that
the earl douglas kept his eyes too much
fixed on the fame and the temporalities this
frail and passing life to feel altogether ashe
ought the claims that refer to a future
world
it is but lately said the prior that he
hath taken up forcible quarters in the monastery
 aberbrothock with his retinue a
thousand followers and the abbot is compelled
to furnish him with all he needs for horse
and man which the earl calls exercising the
hospitality which he hath a right to expect from
the foundation to which his ancestors were
contributors certain it were better to return
to the douglas his lands than to submit to such
exaction which more resembles the masterful
license highland tigers and corners than
the demeanour a christian baron
the black douglass said the king with
a sigh are a race which will not be said
nay but father prior i am myself it may
u
be an intruder this kind for my sojourning
hath been long among you and my retinue
though far fewer than the douglas's are nevertheless
enough to cumber you for their daily
maintenance and though our order is to send
out purveyors to lessen your charge as much
as may be yet if there be inconvenience it were
fitting we should remove in time
now our lady forbid said the prior
who if desirous power had nothing meanly
covetous in his temper but was even magnificent
in his generous kindness certainly the dominican
convent can afford to her sovereign the
hospitality which the house offers to every
wanderer whatever condition who will receive
it at the hands the poor servants our
patron no my royal liege come with ten
times your present train they shall neither want
a grain oats a pile straw a morsel 
bread nor an ounce food which our convent
will not supply them it is one thing to employ
the revenues the church which are
so much larger than monks ought to need or
wish for in the suitable and dutiful reception
 your royal majesty and another to have it
wrenched from us by the hands rude and
violent men whose love rapine is only limited
by the extent their power
it is well good prior said the king 
and now to turn our thoughts for an instant
from state affairs can thy reverence inform us
how the good citizens perth have begun
their valentine's day gallantly and merrily
and peacefully i hope
ki for gallantly my liege i know little 
such qualities for peacefully there were three
or four men two cruelly wounded came this
morning before daylight to ask the privilege 
girth and sanctuary pursued by a hue and cry
 citizens in their shirts with clubs bills lochaber
axes and twohanded swords crying kill
and slay each louder than another nay they
were not satisfied when our porter and watch
told them that those they pursued had taken
refuge in the galilee the church but continued
for some minutes clamouring and striking
upon the postern door demanding that the
men who had offended should be delivered upto
them i was afraid their rude noise might
have broken your majesty's rest and raised
some surprise
my rest might have been broken said the
monarch but that sounds violence should
have occasioned surprise alas reverend father
there is in scotland only one place where
the shriek the victim and threats the
oppressor are not heard and that father is 
the grave
the prior stood in respectful silence sympathizing
with the feelings a monarch whose
tenderness heart suited so ill with the condition
and manners his people
and what became the fugitives asked
robert after a minute's pause
surely sire said the prior they were
dismissed as they desired to be before daylight
 and after we had sent out to be assured
that no ambush their enemies watched them
in the vicinity they went their way in peace
you know nothing inquired the king
who the men were or the cause their taking
refuge with you 
the cause said the prior was the riot
with the townsmen hut how arising is not
known to us the custom our house is to afford
twentyfour hours uninterrupted refuge
in the sanctuary st dominic without asking
any question at the poor unfortunates who have
sought relief there if they desire to remain
for a longer space the cause their resorting
to sanctuary must be put upon the register 
the convent and praised be our holy saint
many persons escape the weight the law by
this temporary protection whom did we know
the character their crimes we might have
found ourselves obliged to render up to their
pursuers and persecutors
as the prior spoke a dim idea occurred to
the monarch that the privilege sanctuary
thus peremptorily executed must prove a severe
interruption to the course justice through
his realm but he repelled the feeling as if it
had been a suggestion satan and took care
that not a single word should escape to betray
to the churchman that such a profane thought
had ever occupied his bosom on the contrary
he hasted to change the subject
 the sun he said moves slowly on the
index after the painful information you have
given me i expected the lords my council
ere now to take order with the ravelled affairs 
this unhappy riot evil was the fortune which
gave me rule over a people among whom it
seems to me i am in my own person the only
man who desires rest and tranquillity
the church always desires peace and tranquillity
added the prior not suffering even so
general a proposition to escape the poor king's
oppressed mind without insisting on a saving
clause for the church's honour
we meant nothing else said robert
but father prior you will allow that the
church in quelling strife as is doubtless her
purpose resembles the busy housewife who
puts in motion the dust which she means to
sweep away
to this remark the prior would have made
some reply but the door the apartment was
opened and a gentleman usher announced the
duke albany
i
chapter 
if i know how to manage these affairs
thus thrust disorderly upon my hands
never believe me 
richard 
the duke albany was like his royal brother
named robert the christian name the
latter had been john until he was called to the
throne when the superstition the times observed
that the name had been connected with
misfortune in the lives and reigns john 
england john france and john baliol 
scotland it was therefore agreed that to
elude the bad omen the new king should assume
the name robert rendered dear to
scotland by the recollections robert bruce
we mention this to account for the existence
 two brothers the same christian name in
one family which was not certainly an usual
occurrence more than at the present day
albany also an aged man was not supposed
to be much more disposed for warlike
enterprise than the king himself but if he
had not courage he had wisdom to conceal and
cloak over his want that quality which once
suspected would have ruined all the plans
which his ambition had formed he had also
pride enough to supply in extremity the want
 real valour and command enough over his
nerves to conceal their agitation in other respects
he was experienced in the ways courts
calm cool and crafty fixing upon the points
which he desired to attain while they were yet
far removed and never losing sight them
though the winding paths in which he trode
might occasionally seem to point to a different
direction in his person he resembled the
king for he was noble and majestic both in stature
and countenance but he had the advantage
 his elder brother in being unencumbered
with any infirmity and in every respect lighter
and more active his dress was rich and grave
as became his age and rank and like his royal
brother he wore no arms any kind a case
 small knives supplying at his girdle the place
usually occupied by a dagger in absence a
sword
at the duke's entrance the prior after making
an obeisance respectfully withdrew to a recess
in the apartment at some distance from the
royal seat in order to leave the conversation 
the brothers uncontrolled by the presence a
third person it is necessary to mention that the
recess was formed by a window placed in the
inner front the monastic buildings called the
palace from its being the frequent residence
 the kings scotland but which was unless
on such occasions the residence the prior
or abbot the window was placed over the
principal entrance to the royal apartments and
commanded a view the internal quadrangle
 the convent formed on the right hand by
the length the magnificent church on the
left by a building containing the range cellars
with the refectory chapterhouse and
other conventual apartments rising above them
for such existed altogether independent the
space occupied by king robert and his attendants
 while a fourth row buildings showing
a noble outward front to the rising sun consisted
 a large hospital for the reception
 strangers and pilgrims and many subordinate
offices warehouses and places accommodation
for the ample stores which supplied
the magnificent hospitality the dominican
fathers a lofty vaulted entrance led
through this eastern front into the quadrangle
and was precisely opposite to the window at
which prior anselm stood so that he could see
underneath the dark arch and observe the light
which gleamed beneath it from the eastern and
open portal but owing to the height to which
he was raised and the depth the vaulted
archway his eye could but indistinctly reach
the opposite and external portal it is necessary
to notice these localities we return to the conversation
between the princely relatives
my dear brother said the king raising
the duke albany as he stooped to kiss his
hand my dear dear brother wherefore this
ceremonial are we not both sons the same
stewart scotland and the same elizabeth
more 
i have not forgot that it is so said albany
arising but i must not omit in the
familiarity the brother the respect that is
due to the king
oh true most true robin answered the
king the throne is like a lofty and barren
rock upon which flower or shrub can never
take root all kindly feelings all tender affections
are denied to a monarch a king must
not fold a brother to his heart he dare not
give way to fondness for a son 
such in some respects is the doom 
greatness sire answered albany but heaven
who removed to some distance from your
majesty's sphere the members your own family
has given you a whole people to be your
children
alas robert answered the monarch
your heart is better framed for the duties 
a sovereign than mine i see from the height at
which fate has placed me that multitude whom
you call my children i love them i wish them
well but they are many and they are distant
from me alas even the meanest them has
some beloved being whom he can clasp to his
heart and upon whom he can lavish the fondness
 a father but all that a king can give
to a people is a smile such as the sun bestows
on the snowy peaks the grampian mountains
as distant and as ineffectual alas robin 
our father used to caress us and if he chid us
it was with a tone kindness yet he was a
monarch as well as i and wherefore should not
i be permitted like him to reclaim my poor
prodigal by affection as well as severity 
had affection never been tried my liege
replied albany in the tone one who delivers
sentiments which he grieves to utter means
 gentleness ought assuredly to be first made
use your grace is best judge whether they
have been long enough persevered in and whether
those discouragement and restraint may
not prove a more effectual corrective it is exclusively
in your royal power to take what
measures with the duke rothsay you think
will be most available to his ultimate benefit
and that the kingdom
this is unkind brother said the king 
m you indicate the painful path which you would
have me pursue yet you offer me not your support
in treading it
my support your grace may ever command
replied albany but would it become
me all men on earth to prompt to your
grace severe measures against your son and
heir me on whom in case failure which
heaven forefend your grace's family this
fatal crown might descend would it not bethought
and said by the fiery march and the
haughty douglas that albany had sown dissension
between his royal brother and the heir
to the scottish throne perhaps to clear the way
for the succession his own family no my
liege i can sacrifice my life to your service
but i must not place my honour in danger
you say true robin you say very true
replied the king hastening to put his own interpretation
upon his brother's words wo
s

must not suffer these powerful and dangerous
lords to perceive that there is aught like discord
in the royal family that must be avoided 
all things and therefore we will still try indulgent
measures in hopes correcting the follies
 roth say i behold sparks hope in him
robin from time to time that are well worth
cherishing he is young very young a prince
and in the heyday his blood we will have
patience with him like a good rider with a hottempered
horse let him exhaust this idle humour
and no one will be better pleased with
him than yourself you have censured me in
your kindness for being too gentle too retired
rothsay has no such defects
i will pawn my life he has not replied
albany drily
and he wants not reflection as well as
spirit continued the poor king pleading the
cause his son to his brother i have sent
for him to attend council today and we shall
see how he acquits himself his devoir you
yourself allow robin that the prince wants
vol igl
 audience dressed in the ordinary riding garb
 the time and wearing his poniard he had
left in the anteroom the page honour who
carried his sword the earl was a wellbuilt
handsome man faircomplexioned with a considerable
profusion lightcoloured hair and
bright blue eyes which gleamed like those a
falcon he exhibited in his countenance otherwise
pleasing the marks a hasty and irritable
temper which his situation as a high and
powerful feudal lord had given him but too
many opportunities indulging
i am glad to see you my lord march
said the king with a gracious inclination his
person k you have been long absent from our
councils
m my liege answered march with a deep
reverence to the king and a haughty and formal
inclination to the duke albany if i
have been absent from your grace's councils
it is because my place has been supplied by more
acceptable and i doubt not abler counsellors
and now i come but to say to your highness
that the news from the english frontier make
it necessary that i should return without delay
to my own estates your grace has your wise
and politic brother my lord albany with
whom to consult and the mighty and warlike
earl douglas to carry your councils into effect
i am no use save in my own country 
and thither with your highness's permission
i am purposed instantly to return to attend my
charge as warden the eastern marches 
you will not deal so unkindly with us
cousin replied the gentle monarch here
are evil tidings on the wind these unhappy
highland clans are again breaking into general
commotion and the tranquillity even our
own court requires the best our council to
advise and the bravest our barons to execute
what may be resolved upon the descendant
 thomas randolph will not surely
abandon the grandson robert bruce at such
a period as this 
i leave with him the descendant the farfamed
james douglas answered march
it is his lordship's boast that he never puts
foot in stirrup but a thousand horse mount with
him as his daily lifeguard and i believe the
monks aberbrothock will swear to the fact

surely with all the douglas's chivalry they
are fitter to restrain a disorderly swarm 
highland kerne than i can be to withstand the
archery england and power henry hotspur
 and then here is his grace albany
so jealous in his care your highness's person
that he calls your brandanes to take arms when
a dutiful subject like myself approaches the
court with a poor halfscore horse the retinue
 the meanest the petty barons who own
a tower and a thousand acres barren heath
when such precautions are taken where there
is not the slightest chance peril since i trust
none was to be apprehended from me your
royal person will surely be suitably guarded in
real danger
my lord march said the duke albany
 the meanest the barons whom you
speak put their followers in arms even when
they receive their dearest and nearest friends
within the iron gate their castle and if it
please our lady i will not care less for the
king's person than they do for their own the
brandanes are the king's immediate retainers
and household servants and an hundred them

is but a small guard round his grace when
yourself my lord as well as the earl douglas
often ride with ten times the number
my lord duke replied march when
the service the king requires it i can ride
with ten times as many horse as your grace has
named but i have never done so either traitorously
to entrap the king nor boastfully to
overawe other nobles
brother robert said the king ever anxious
to be a peacemaker you do wrong
even to intimate a suspicion my lord 
march and you cousin march misconstrue
my brother's caution but hark to
divert this angry parley i hear no unpleasing
touch minstrelsy you know the gay
science my lord march and love it well 
step to yonder window beside the holy prior
at whom we make no question touching secular
pleasures and you will tell us if the music and
lay be worth listening to the notes are 
france i think my brother albany's judgment
is not worth a cockleshell in such matters
 so you cousin must report your opinion
whether the poor gleemaiden deserves recompense
our son and the douglas will presently
be here and then when our council is assembled
we will treat graver matters
with something like a smile on his proud
brow march withdrew into the recess the
window and stood there in silence beside the
prior like one who while he obeyed the king's
command saw through and despised the timid
precaution which it implied as an attempt to
prevent the dispute betwixt albany and himself
the tune which was played upon a viol
was gay and sprightly in the commencement
with a touch the wildness the troubadour
music but as it proceeded the faltering
tones the instrument and the female voice
which accompanied it became plaintive and interrupted
a if choked by the painful feelings
 the minstrel
the offended earl whatever might be his
judgment in such matters on which the king
had complimented him paid it may be supposed
little attention to the music the female
minstrel his proud heart was struggling between
the allegiance he owed his sovereign as
well as the love he still found lurking in his
bosom for the person his wellnatured king
and a desire vengeance arising out his
disappointed ambition and the disgrace done
to him by the substitution marjory douglas
to be bride the heirapparent instead his
betrothed daughter march had the vices and
virtues a hasty and uncertain character and
even now when he came to bid the king adieu
with the purpose renouncing his allegiance as
soon as he reached his own feudal territories he
felt unwilling and almost unable to resolve
upon a step so criminal and so full peril it
was with such dangerous cogitations that he
was occupied during the beginning the gleemaiden's
lay but objects which called his attention
powerfully as the songstress proceeded
affected the current his thoughts and riveted
them on what was passing in the courtyard
 the monastery the song was in the provencal
dialect well understood as the language 
poetry in all the courts europe and particularly
in scotland it was more simply turned
however than was the general caste the
sirventes and rather resembled the lai a
norman minstrel it may be translated thus 
fie ta good loufee
ah poor louise the livelong day
she roams from cot to castle gay 
and still her voice and viol say
ah maids beware the woodland way
think on louise 
ah poor louise the sun was high
it smirch'd her cheek it dimm'd her eye
the woodland walk was cool and nigh
where birds with chiming streamlets vie
to cheer louise
ah poor louise the savage bear
made ne'er that lovely grove his lair 
the wolves molest not paths so fair 
but better far had such been there
for poor louise
ah poor louise in woody wold
she met a huntsman fair and bold 
his aldrich was silk and gold
and many a witching tale he told
to poor louise
ah poor louise small cause to pine
hadst thou for treasures the mine 
for peace mind that gift divine
and spotless innocence were thine
ah poor louise 
ah poor louise thy treasure's reft 
i know not if by force or theft
or part by violence part by gift 
but misery is all that's left
to poor louise
let poor louise some succour have 
she will not long your bounty crave
or tire the gay with warning stave 
for heaven has grace and earth a grave
for poor louise
the song was no sooner finished than anxious
lest the dispute should be revived betwixt
his brother and the earl march king
robert called to the latter what think you
 the minstrelsy my lord methinks as i
heard it even at this distance it was a wild and
pleasing lay
my judgment is not deep my lord but
the singer may dispense with my approbation
since she seems to have received that his
grace rothsay the first judge in scotland

how said the king in alarm is my
son below 
he is sitting on horseback by the glec
maiden said march with a malicious smile
on his cheek ft apparently as much interested
by her conversation as her music
how is this father prior said the king
but the prior drew back from the lattice
i have no will to see my lord things
which it would pain me to repeat
how is all this said the king who coloured
deeply and seemed about to rise from his
chair but changed his mind as if unwilling
perhaps to look upon some unbecoming prank
 the wild young prince which he might not
have had heart to punish with necessary severity
the earl march seemed to have a pleasure
in informing him that which doubtless
he desired to remain ignorant
 my liege he cried this is better and
better the gleemaiden has not only engaged
the ear the prince scotland as well as 
every groom and trooper in the courtyard but
she has riveted the attention the black douglas
whom we have not known as a passionate
admirer the gay science but truly i
do not wonder at his astonishment for the prince
j
has honoured the fair professor song and viol
with a kiss approbation
how cried the king is rothsay trifling
with a gleemaiden and his wife's father
in presence go my good father abbot call
the prince here instantly go my dearest brother
 and when they had both left the
room the king continued go good cousin 
march there will be mischief i am assured 
it i pray you go cousin and second my lord
prior's prayers with my commands
you forget my liege said march with
the voice a deeply offended person the father
 elizabeth dunbar were but an unfit
intercessor between the douglas and his royal
soninlaw
i crave your pardon cousin said the gentle
old man i own you have had some wrong
but my rothsay will be murdered i must
go myself
but as he arose precipitately from his chair
the poor king missed a footstep stumbled and
fell heavily to the ground in such a manner
that his head striking the corner the seat
from which he had risen he became for a minute
insensible the sight the accident at
once overcame march's resentment and melted
his heart he ran to the fallen monarch
and replaced him in his seat using in the tenderest
and most respectful manner such means
as seemed most fit to recall animation robert
opened his eyes and gazed around with uncertainty

what has happened are we alone who
is with us 
your dutiful subject march replied the
earl
alone with the earl march repeated
the king his still disturbed intellects receiving
some alarm from the name a powerful chief
whom he had reason to believe he had mortally
offended
yes my gracious liege with poor george
 dunbar whom many have wished your
majesty to think ill though he will be found
truer to your royal person at the last than they
will
indeed cousin you have had too much
wrong and believe me we shall strive to redress
 
if your grace thinks so it may yet be
righted interrupted the earl the prince and
marjory douglas are nearly related the dispensation
from rome was informally granted
their marriage cannot be lawful the pope
who will do much for so godly a prince can set
aside this unchristian union in respect the
precontract bethink you well my liege continued
the earl kindling with a new train 
ambitious thoughts to which the unexpected opportunity
 pleading his cause personally had
given rise bethink you how you choose betwixt
the douglas and me he is powerful and
mighty i grant but george dunbar wears
the keys scotland at his belt and could bring
an english army to the gates edinburgh ere
douglas could leave the skirts charitable to
oppose them your royal son loves my poor deserted
girl and hates the haughty marjory 
douglas your grace may judge the small account
in which he holds her by his toying with
a common gleemaiden even in the presence 
her father
the king had hitherto listened to the earl's
argument with the bewildered feelings a
timid horseman borne away by an impetuous
steed whose course he can neither arrest nor
direct but the last words awakened in his recollection
the sense his son's immediate danger

oh ay most true my son the douglas
oh my dear cousin prevent blood and all
shall be as you will hark there is a tumult 
that was the clash arms
by my coronet by my knightly faith it
is true said the earl looking from the window
upon the inner square the convent now
filled with armed men and brandished weapons
and resounding with the clash armour
the deepvaulted entrance was crowded with
warriors at its farthest extremity and blows
seemed to be in the act being exchanged
betwixt some who were endeavouring to shut
the gate and others who contended to press in
i will go instantly said the earl marchand
soon quell this sudden broil humbly
vol i s
i pray your majesty to think on what i have
had the boldness to propose
i will i will fair cousin said the king
scarce knowing to what he pledged himself 
do but prevent tumult and bloodshed 
chapter x
we must here trace a little more correctly
the events which had been indistinctly seen
from the window the royal apartments and
yet more indistinctly reported by those who
witnessed them the gleemaiden already mentioned
had planted herself where a rise two
large broad steps giving access to the main
gateway the royal apartments gained her
an advantage a foot and a half in height
over those in the court whom she hoped to
form an audience she wore the dress her
calling which was more gaudy than rich and
showed the person more than did the garb 
other females she had laid aside an upper
mantle and a small basket which contained her
slender stock necessaries and a little french
spaniel dog sat beside them as their protector
an azureblue jacket embroidered with silver
and sitting close to the person was open in
front and showed several waistcoats differ en t
coloured silks calculated to set off the symmetry
 the shoulders and bosom and remaining
open at the throat a small silver chain worn
around her neck involved itself amongst these
brilliantcoloured waistcoats and was again
produced from them to display a medal the
same metal which intimated in the name 
some court or guild minstrels the degree
she had taken in the gay or joyous science
a small scrip suspended over her shoulders by
a blue silk ribband hung on her left side
her sunny complexion snowwhite teeth
brilliant black eyes and raven locks marked
her country lying far in the south france
and the arch smile and dimpled chin bore
the same character her luxuriant locks twisted
around a small gold bodkin were kept
in their position by a net silk and gold
short petticoats deeplaced with silver to correspond
with the jacket red stockings which
were visible to near the calf the leg and
buskins spanish leather completed her adjustment
which though far from new had been
saved as an untarnished holiday suit which much
care had kept in good order she seemed about
twentyfive years old but perhaps fatigue and
wandering had anticipated the touch time
in obliterating the freshness early youth
we have said the gleemaiden's manner was
lively and we may add that her smile and repartee
were ready but her gaiety was assumed
as a quality essentially necessary to her
trade which it was one the miseries that
the professors were obliged frequently to cover
an aching heart with a compelled smile this
seemed to be the case with louise who whether
she was actually the heroine her own
song or whatever other cause she might have
for sadness showed at times a strain deep
melancholy thought which interfered with and
controlled the natural flow lively spirits
which the practice the joyous science especially
required she lacked also even in her
gayest sallies the decided boldness and effrontery
 her sisterhood who were seldom at a
loss to retort a saucy jest or turn the laugh
against any who interrupted or interfered with 
them
it may be here remarked that it was impossible
that this class women very numerous
in that age could bear a character generally
respectable they were however protected
by the manners the time and such were the
immunities they possessed by the rights chivalry
that nothing was more rare than to hear
 such errant damsels sustaining injury or
wrong and they passed and repassed safely
where armed travellers would probably have encountered
a bloody opposition but though
licensed and protected in honour their tuneful
art the wandering minstrels male or female
like similar ministers to the public amusement
the itinerant musicians for instance
and strolling comedians our own day led a
life too irregular and precarious to be accounted
a creditable part society indeed among
the stricter catholics the profession was considered
as unlawful
such was the damsel who with viol in
hand and stationed on the slight elevation we
have mentioned stepped forward to the bystanders
and announced herself as a mistress
 the gay science duly qualified by a brief from
a court love and music held at aix in
provence under the countenance the flower
 chivalry the gallant count aimer who now
prayed that the cavaliers merry scotland who
were known over the wide world for bravery and
courtesy would permit a poor stranger to try
whether she could afford them any amusement
by her art the love song was like the love
 fight a common passion the age which
all at least affected whether they actually possessed
it or no therefore the acquiescence in
louise's proposal was universal at the same
time an aged darkbrowed monk who was
among the bysanders thought it necessary to
remind the gleemaiden that since she was tolerated
within these precincts which was an
unusual grace he trusted nothing would be sunjr
or said inconsistent with the holy character 
the place
the gleemaiden bent her head low shook
her sable locks and crossed herself reverentially
as if she disclaimed the possibility such a
transgression and then began the song poor
louise which we gave at length in the last
chapter
just as she commenced she was stopped by
a cry for room room place for the duke
 rothsay 
nay hurry no man on my score said a
gallant young cavalier who entered on a noble
arabian horse which he managed with exquisite
grace though by such slight handling the
reins such imperceptible pressure the limbs
and sway the body that to any eye save that
 an experienced horseman the animal seemed
to be putting forth his paces for his own amusement
and thus gracefully bearing forward a
rider who was too indolent to give himself any
trouble about the matter
the prince's apparel which was very rich
was put on with slovenly carelessness his
form though his stature was low and his
limbs extremely slight was elegant in the extreme
and his features no less handsome but
there was on his brow a haggard paleness which
seemed the effect care or dissipation or
 both these wasting causes combined his
eyes were sunk and dim as from late indulgence
in revelry on the preceding evening while his
cheek was inflamed with unnatural red as if
either the effect the bacchanalian orgies had
not passed away from the constitution or a
morning draught had been resorted to in order
to remove the effects the night's debauchery
such was the duke roth say and heir 
the scottish crown a sight at once interest
and compassion all unbonneted and made
way for him while he kept repeating carelessly
no haste no haste i shall arrive soon enough
at the place i am bound for how's this a
damsel the joyous science ay by st giles 
and a comely wench to boot stand still my
merry men never was minstrelsy marred forme
 a good voice by the mass begin me
that lay again sweetheart
louise did not know the person who addressed
her but the general respect paid by all
around and the easy and indifferent manner in
which it was received showed her she was addressed
by a man the highest quality she
recommenced her lay and sung her best accordingly
 while the young duke seemed thoughtful
and rather affected towards the close the
ditty but it was not his habit to cherish such
melancholy affections this is a plaintive ditty
my nutbrown maid said he chucking the
retreating gleemaiden under the chin and detaining
her by the collar her dress which was
not difficult as he sat on horseback so close to
the steps on which she stood but i warrant
me you have livelier notes at will ma bella tenebraska
 ay and canst sing in bower as well as
wold and by night as well as day
i am no nightingale my lord said louise
endeavouring to escape a species gallantry
which illsuited the place and circumstances a
discrepancy to which he who addressed it to
her seemed contemptuously indifferent
what hast thou there darling he added
removing his hold from her collar to the scrip
which she carried
glad was louise to escape his grasp by slipping
the knot the ribband and leaving the
little bag in the prince's hand as retiring back
beyond his reach she answered nuts my
lord the last season
the prince pulled out a handful nuts accordingly
 nuts child they will break
thine ivory teeth hurt thy pretty voice said
rothsay cracking one with his teeth like a
village schoolboy
they are not the walnuts my own
sunny clime my lord said louise but they
hang low and are within the reach the
poor
you shall have something to give you better
fare poor wandering ape said the duke
in a tone in which feeling predominated more
than in the affected and contemptuous gallantry
 his first address to the glee maiden
at this moment as he turned to ask an attendant
for his purse the prince encountered
the stern and piercing look a tall black man
seated on a powerful irongrey horse who had
entered with attendants while the duke 
rothsay was engaged with louise and now remained
stupefied and almost turned to stone by
his surprise and anger at this unseemly spectacle
even one who had never seen the black
douglas must have known him by his swart
complexion his gigantic frame his buffcoat 
bell'shide and his air courage firmness and
sagacity mixed with the most indomitable pride
the loss an eye in battle though not perceptible
at first sight as the ball the ins used
organ remained similar to the other gave yet
a stern immovable glare to the whole aspect
the meeting the royal soninlaw with his
terrible step father was in circumstances which
arrested the attention all present and the
bysanders waited the issue with silence and
suppressed breath lest they should lose any part
 what was to ensue
when the duke rothsay saw the expression
which occupied the stern features douglas
and remarked that the earl did not make
the least motion towards respectful or even
civil salutation he seemed determined to show
him how little respect he was disposed to pay to
his displeased looks he took his purse from
his chamberlain
here pretty one he said i give thee
one gold piece for the song thou hast sung
me another for the nuts i have stolen from
thee and a third for the kiss thou art about to
give me for know my pretty one that when
fair lips and thine for fault better may be
called so make sweet music for my pleasure
i am sworn to st valentine to press them to
mine
my song is recompensed nobly said louise
shrinking back my nuts are sold to a good
market farther traffic my lord were neither
befitting you nor beseeming me
what you coy it my nymph the highway
said the prince contemptuously know
damsel that one asks you a grace who is unused
to denial
it is the prince scotland the duke
tf
 rothsay said the courtiers around to the
terrified louise pressing forward the trembling
young woman you must not thwart his humour

but i cannot reach your lordship she
said you sit so high on horseback
if i must alight said rothsay there
shall be the heavier penalty what does the
wench tremble for place thy foot on the toe
 my boot give me hold thy hand gallantly
done he kissed her as she stood thus suspended
in the air perched upon his foot and
supported by his hand saying there is thy
kiss and there is my purse to pay it and to
grace thee farther rothsay will wear thy scrip
for the day he suffered the frightened girl to
spring to the ground and turned his looks from
her to bend them contemptuously on the earl
 douglas as if he had said all this i do in
despite you and your daughter's claims
by st bride douglas said the earl
pressing towards the prince this is too much
unmannered boy as void sense as honour 
you know what considerations restrain the hand
 douglas else had you never dared m
can you play at spangcockle my lord
said the prince placing a nut on the second
joint his forefinger and spinning it off by a
smart application the thumb the nut struck
on douglas's broad breast who burst out into
a dreadful exclamation wrath inarticulate
but resembling the growl a lion in depth and
sternness expression i cry your pardon
most mighty lord said the duke rothsay
scornfully while all around trembled i did
not conceive my pellet could have wounded you
seeing you wear a buffcoat surely i trust it
did not hit your eye 
the prior dispatched by the king as we
have seen in the last chapter had by this time
made way through the crowd and laying hold
on douglas's rein in a manner that made it impossible
for him to advance reminded him that
the prince was the son his sovereign and
the husband his daughter
fear not sir prior said douglas i
despise the childish boy too much to raise a
finger against him but i will return insult for
insult here any you who love the douglas
spurn me this quean from the monastery
gates and let her be so scourged that she may
bitterly remember to the last day her life
how she gave means to an respective boy to
affront the douglas 
four or five retainers instantly stepped forth
to execute commands which were seldom uttered
in vain and heavily would louise have
atoned for an offence which she was alike
the innocent unconscious and unwilling instrument
had not the duke rothsay interfered

spurn the poor gleewoman he said in
high indignation scourge her for obeying
my commands spurn thine own oppressed
vassals rude earl scourge thine own faulty
hounds but beware how you touch so much
as a dog that rothsay hath patted on the head
far less a female whose lips he hath kissed 
before douglas could give an answer which
would certainly have been in defiance there
arose that great tumult at the outward gate 
the monastery already noticed and men both
on horseback and on foot began to rush headlong
in not actually fighting with each other
but certainly in no peaceable manner
the contending parties seemingly were partizans
 douglas known by the cognizance
 the bloody heart and citizens the town
 perth it appeared they had been skirmishing
in earnest when without the gates but out 
respect to the sanctified ground they lowered
their weapons when they entered and confined
their strife to a war words and mutual abuse
the tumult had this good effect that it forced
asunder by the weight and press numbers
the prince and douglas at a moment
when the levity the former and the pride 
the latter were urging them to the utmost extremity
but now peacemakers interfered on all
sides the prior and the monks threw themselves
among the multitude and commanded
peace in the name heaven and reverence to
their sacred walls under penalty excommunication
 and their expostulations began to be
listened to albany who was dispatched by his
royal brother at the beginning the fray had
not arrived till now on the scene action he
vol i t
instantly applied himself to douglas and in his
ear conjured him to temper his passion
by st bride douglas i will be avenged 
said the earl no man shall brook life after
he has passed an affront on douglas
why so you may be avenged in fitting
time said albany bullet it not be said
that like a peevish woman the great douglas
could choose neither time nor place for his vengeance
bethink you all that we have laboured
at is like to be upset by an accident george
 dunbar hath had the advantage an audience
with the old man and though it lasted but
five minutes i fear it may endanger the dissolution
 your family match which we brought
about with so much difficulty the authority
from rome has not yet been obtained
a toy answered douglas haughtily 
m they dare not dissolve it
not while douglas is at large and in possession
 his power answered albany but
noble earl come with me and i will show you
at what disadvantage you stand
douglas dismounted and followed his wily
accomplice in silence in a lower hall they saw
l
the ranks the brandanes drawn up wellarmed
in caps steel and shirts mail
their captain making an obeisance to albany
seemed to desire to address him
u what now maclouis said the duke
we are informed the duke rothsay has
been insulted and i can scarce keep the bran
danes within door
u gallant maclouis said albany and
you my trusty brandanes the duke rothsay
my princely nephew is as well as a hopeful
gentleman can be some scuffle there has been
but all is appeased he continued to draw
the earl douglas forward m you see my
lord he said in his ear that if the word arrest
was to be once spoken it would be soon
obeyed and you are aware your attendants are
few for resistance
douglas seemed to acquiesce in the necessity
 patience for the time if my teeth he
said should bite through my lips i will b
silent till it is the hour to speak out
george march in the meanwhile had a
more easy task pacifying the prince mv
lord rothsay be said approaching him
with grave ceremony i need not tell you that
you owe me something for reparation honour
though i blame not you personally for the
breach contract which has destroyed the peace
 my family let me conjure you by what observance
your highness may owe an injured
man to forego for the present this scandalous
dispute
my lord i owe you much replied rothsay
 but this haughty and all controlling lord
has wounded mine honour
my lord i can but add your royal father
is ill hath swooned with terror for your highness's
safety
rl the kind good old man swooned
said you my lord march i am with him
in an instant
the duke rothsay sprung from his saddle
to the ground and was dashing into the palace
like a greyhound when a feeble grasp was laid
on his cloak and the faint voice a kneeling
female exclaimed protection my noble
prince protection for a helpless stranger 
 hands off stroller said the earl march
thrusting the suppliant gleemaiden aside
but the gentler prince paused it is true
he said i have brought the vengeance an
unforgiving devil upon this helpless creature
o heaven what a life is mine so fatal to all
who approach me what to do in the hurry 
she must not go to my apartments and all
my men are such born reprobates ha thou
at mine elbow honest harry smith what
dost thou here 
there has been something a fight my
lord answered our acquaintance the smith
between the townsmen and the southland
loons who ride with the douglas and we have
winged them as far as the abbeygate
lam glad it i am glad it and you
beat the knaves fairly 
fairly does your highness ask said
henry why ay we were stronger in numbers
to be sure but no men ride better armed
than those who follow the bloody heart and
so in a sense we beat them fairly for as your
highness knows it is the smith who makes the
menatarms and men with good weapons area
match for great odds
while they thus talked the earl march
ivho had spoken with some one near the palace
gate returned in anxious haste my lord
duke my lord duke your father is recovered
and if you haste not speedily my lord
 albany and the douglas will have possession
 his royal ear
 and if my royal father is recovered said
the thoughtless prince and is holding or
about to hold council with my gracious uncle
and the earl douglas it befits neither your
lordship nor me to intrude till we are summoned
so there is time for me to speak my
little business with mine honest armourer here
does your highness take it so said the
earl whose sanguine hopes a change favour
at court had been too hastily excited and
were as speedily checked then so let it befor
george dunbar
he glided away with a gloomy and displeased
aspect and thus out the two most powerful
noblemen in scotland at a time when the aristocracy
so closely controlled the throne the reckless
heirapparent had made two enemies the
one by scornful defiance and the other by careless
neglect he heeded not the earl march's
departure however or rather he felt relieved
from his importunity
the prince went on in indolent conversation
with our armourer whose skill in his art
had made him known to many the great lords
about the court
i had something to say to thee smithcanst
thou take up a fallen link in my milan
hauberk 
as well please your highness as my mother
could take up a stitch in the nets she wove
the meaner shall not know my work from
his own
well but that was not what i wished 
thee just now said the prince recollecting
himself this poor glee woman good smith
she must be placed in safety thou art man
enough to be any woman's champion and thou
must conduct her to some place safety
henry smith was as we have seen sufficiently
rash and daring when weapons were in
question but he had also the pride a decent
burgher and was unwilling to place himself in
what might be thought equivocal circumstances
by the sober part his fellowcitizens
may it please your highness he said u i
am but a poor craftsman but though my arm
and sword are at the king's service and your
highness's i am with reverence no squire 
dames your highness will find among your
own retinue knights and lords willing enough
to play sir pandarus troy it is too knightly
a part for poor hal the wynd
humph hah said the prince my
purse edgar his attendant whispered him
true true i gave it to the poor wench i
know enough your craft and craftsmen in
general to be aware that men lure not hawks
with empty hands but i suppose my word
may pass for the price a good armour and
i will pay it thee with thanks to boot for this
slight service
your highness may know other craftsmen
said the smith but with reverence
you know not henry gow he will obey you
in making a weapon or in welding one but he
knows nothing this petticoat service
hark thee thou perthshire mule said
the prince yet smiling while he spoke at the
sturdy punctilio the honest burgher the
wench is as little to me as she is to thee butin
an idle moment as you may learn from those
about thee if thou safest it not thyself i did
her a passing grace which is likely to cost the
poor wretch her life there is no one here whom
i can trust to protect her against the discipline
 belt and bowstring with which the border
brutes who follow douglas will beat her to
death since such is his pleasure
if such be the case my liege she has a
right to every honest man's protection and
since she wears a petticoat though i would it
were longer and a less fanciful fashion i
will answer for her protection as well as a single
man may but where am i to bestow
her 
good faith i cannot tell said the prince
take her to sir john ramorny's lodging
but no no he is ill at ease and besides there
are reasons take her to the devil if thou wilt
but place her in safety and oblige robin 
rothsay
my noble prince said the smith i think
 always with reverence that i would rather
give a defenceless woman to the care the devil
than sir john ramorny but though the
devil be a worker in fire like myself yet i know
not his haunts and with aid holy church
hope to keep him on terms defiance and
moreover how i am to convey her out this
crowd or through the streets in such a mumming
habit may be well made a question
for the leaving the convent said the
prince this good monk seizing upon the
nearest by his cowl father nicholas or boniface

poor brother cyprian at your highness s
command said the father
ay ay brother cyprian continued the
prince yes brother cyprian shall let you
out at some secret passage which he knows 
and i will see him again to pay a prince's
thanks for it
the churchman bowed in acquiescence and
poor louise who during this debate had looked
from the one speaker to the other hastilysaid
 i will not scandalize this good man with
my foolish garb i have a mantle for ordinary
wear
why there smith thou hast a friars hood
and a woman's mantle to shroud thee under i
would all my frailties were as well shrouded 
farewell honest fellow i will thank thee hereafter

then as if afraid farther objection on the
smith's part he hastened into the palace
henry gow remained stupefied at what had
passed and at finding himself involved in a
charge at once inferring much danger and an
equal risk scandal both which joined to a
principal share which he had taken with his
usual forwardness in the fray might he saw
do him no small injury in the suit he pursued
most anxiously at the same time to leave a
defenceless creature to the ill usage the barbarous
collegians and licentious followers 
the douglas was a thought which his manly
heart could not brook for an instant
he was roused from his reverie by the voice
 the monk who sliding out his words with
the indifference which the holy fathers entertained
or affected towards all temporal matters
desired them to follow him the smith put
himself in motion with a sigh much resembling
a groan and without appearing exactly connected
with the monk's motions he followed
him into a cloister and through a postern door
which after looking once behind him the priest
left ajar behind them followed louise who
had hastily assumed her small bundle and calling
her little fourlegged companion had eagerly
followed in the path which opened an escape
from what had shortly before seemed a great
and inevitable danger
chapter xi
the party were now by a secret passage
admitted within the church the outward doors
 which usually left open had been closed
against every one in consequence the recent
tumult when the rioters both parties had
endeavoured to rush into it for other purposes
than those devotion they traversed the
gloomy aisles whose arched roof resounded
to the heavy tread the armourer but was
silent under the standard foot the monk and
the light step poor louise who trembled
excessively as much from fear as cold she
saw that neither her spiritual nor temporal conductor
looked kindly upon her the former
was an austere man whose aspect seemed to
hold the luckless wanderer in some degree 
horror as well as contempt while the latter
though as we have seen one the best natured
men living was at present grave to the
pitch sternness and not a little displeased
with having the part he was playing forced
upon him without as he was constrained to
feel a possibility his declining it
his dislike at his task extended itself to
the innocent object his protection and he
internally said to himself as he surveyed her
scornfully a proper queen beggars to
walk the streets perth with and i a decent
burgher this tawdry minion must have as
ragged a reputation as the rest her sisterhood
and i am finely sped if my chivalry in
her behalf comes to catharine's ears i had
better have slain a man were he the best in
perth and by hammer and nails i would have
done it on provocation rather than convoy this
baggage through the city
perhaps louise suspected the cause her
conductor's anxiety for she said timidly and
with hesitation worthy sir were it not better
i should stop one instant in that chapel
and don my mantle 
humph sweetheart well proposed said
the armourer hut the monk interfered raising
at the same time the finger interdiction
the chapel holy st maddox is no tiring
room for vile jugglers and strollers to shift
their trappings in i will presently show thee
a vestry more suited to thy condition
the poor young woman hung down her
humbled head and turned from the chapel
door which she had approached with the deep
sense selfabasement her little spaniel
seemed to gather from his mistress's looks and
manner that they were unauthorized intruders
on the holy ground which they trode and hung
his ears and swept the pavement with his tail
as he trotted slowly and close to louise's
heels
the monk moved on without a pause they
descended a broad flight steps and proceeded
through a labyrinth subterranean 

sages dimly lighted as they passed a lowarched
door the monk turned and said to
louise with the same stern voice as before 
there daughter folly there is a robingroom
where many before you have deposited
their vestments 
obeying the least signal with ready and timorous
acquiescence she pushed the door open
but instantly recoiled with terror it was a
charnelhouse half filled with dry skulls and
bones
i fear to change my dress there and alone
but if you father command it be it as you
will
m why thou child vanity the remains on
which thou loosest are but the earthly attire 
those who in their day led or followed in the
pursuit worldly pleasure and such shalt
thou be for all thy mincing and ambling thy
piping and thy harping thou and all such ministers
 frivolous and worldly pleasure must
become like these poor bones whom thy idle
nicety fears and loaths to look upon
 say not with idle nicety reverend father
answered the gleemaiden for heaven
knows i covet the repose these poor bleached
relics and if by stretching my body upon
them i could without sin bring my state to
theirs i would choose that charnel heap for my
place rest beyond the fairest and softest
couch in scotland
be patient and come on said the monk ina
milder tone the reaper must not leave the
harvestwork till the sunset gives the signal
they walked forward brother cyprian at
the a long gallery opened the door a
small apartment or perhaps a chapel for it was
decorated with a crucifix before which burned
four lamps all bent and crossed themselves 
and the priest said to the minstrel maiden pointing
to the crucifix what says that emblem 
that he invites the sinner as well as the
righteous to approach
ay if the sinner put from him his sin
said the monk whose tone voice was evidently
milder prepare thyself here for thy
journey
vol i v

louise remained an instant or two in the chapel
and presently reappeared in a mantle 
coarse grey cloth in which she had closely muffled
herself having put such her more gaudy
habiliments as she had time to take off in the
little basket which had before held her ordinary
attire
the monk presently afterwards unlocked a
door which led to the open air they found
themselves in the garden which surrounded the
monastery the dominicans the southern
gate is on the latch and through it you can pass
unnoticed said the monk bless thee my
son and bless thee too unhappy child remembering
where you put off your idle trinkets
may you take care how you again resume them 
alas father said louise if the poor
foreigner could supply the mere wants life
by any more creditable occupation she has
small wish to profess her idle art but 
but the monk had vanished nay the very
door through which she had just passed appeared
to have vanished also so curiously was it
concealed beneath a flying buttress and among
the profuse ornaments gothic architecture
here is a woman let out by this private postern
sure enough was henry's reflection
pray heaven the good fathers never let any
in the place seems convenient for such games
at bopeep but benedicite what is to be done
next i must get rid this quean as fast as 
can and i must see her safe for let her beat
heart what she may she looks too modest
now she is in decent dress to deserve the usage
which the wild scot galloway or the devil's
legion from the liddell are like to afford her
louise stood as if she waited his pleasure
which way to go her little dog relieved by
the exchange the dark subterranean vault for
the open air sprung in wild gambols through
the walks and jumped upon its mistress and
even though more timidly circled close round
the smith's feet to express its satisfaction to
him also and conciliate his favour
down chariot down said the gleemaiden
 you are glad to get into the blessed
sunshine but where shall we rest at night
my poor chariot 
and now mistress said the smith not
churlishly for it was not in his nature but
bluntly as one who is desirous to finish a disagreeable
employment which way lies your
road 
louise looked on the ground and was silent
on being again urged to say which way she desired
to be conducted she again looked down
and said she could not tell
come come said henry i understand
all that i have been agalliarda reveller in my
day but it's best to be plain as matters are
with me now i am an altered man for these
many many months and so my quean you
and i must part sooner than perhaps a light o
love such as you expected to part with a likely
young fellow
louise wept silently with her eyes still cast
on the ground as one who felt an insult which
she had not a right to complain at length
perceiving that her conductor was grown impatient
she faltered out noble sir 
sir is for a knight said the impatient
burgher and noble is for a baron i am harry
 the wynd an honest mechanic and free 
my guild
good craftsman then said the minstrel
woman you judge me harshly but not without
seeming cause i would relieve you immediately
 my company which it may be brings
little credit to good men did i but know which
way to go
to the next wake or fair to be sure said
henry roughly having no doubt that this distress
was affected for the purpose palming
herself upon him and perhaps dreading to
throw himself into the way temptation and
that is the feast st maddox at auchterarder
i warrant thou wilt find the way thither well
enough
after daughter repeated the glee maiden
her southern tongue in vain attempting the
celtic accentuation i am told my poor lays
will not be understood if i go nearer to yon
dreadful range mountains
 will you abide then in perth 
but where to lodge said the wanderer
why where lodged you last night replied
the smith you know where you came from
surely though you seem doubtful where you
are going 
i slept in the hospital the convent
but i was only admitted upon great importunity
and i was commanded not to return
nay they will never take you in with the
brand the douglas upon you that is even
too true but the prince mentioned sir john
ramorny's i can take you to his lodgings
through bystreets though it is short an
honest burgher's office and my time presses
i will go anywhere i know i am a scandal
and incumbrance there was a time when
it was otherwise but this ramorny who is
he 
a courtly knight who lives a jolly bachelor's
life and is master the horse and private
as they say to the young prince
what to the wild scornful young man who
gave occasion to yonder scandal oh take me
not thither good friend is there no christian
woman who would give a poor creature rest in
her cowhouse or barn for one night i will
be gone with early daybreak i will repay her
richly i have gold and i will repay you too
if and
say nothing what you have seen
m who i nay fear mc not pah i scorn
a talebearer
away with you then i hear the clash 
armour
this put life and mettle into the heels the
bonnetmaker who turning his back on the
supposed danger set off at a pace which the
smith never doubted would speedily bring him
to his own house
here is another chattering jay to deal
with thought the smith but i have a hank
over him too the minstrels have a fabliau 
a daw with borrowed feathers why this oliver
is the very bird and by st dunstan if he lets
his chattering tongue run on at my expense i
will so pluck him as never hawk plumed a partridge
and this he knows
as these reflections thronged on his mind
he had nearly reached the his journey
and with the gleemaiden still hanging on his
cloak exhausted partly with fear partly with
fatigue he at length arrived at the middle 
the wynd which was honoured with his own
habitation and from which in the uncertainty
that then attended the application surnames
he derived one his own appellatives
here on ordinary days his furnace was seen
to blaze and four half stripped knaves stunned
the neighbourhood with the clang hammer
and tithy but st valentine's holiday was an
excuse for these men steel having shut the
shop and for the present being absent on their
own errands devotion or pleasure the
house which adjoined to the smithy called henry
its owner and though it was small and
situated in a narrow street yet as there was
a large garden with fruit trees behind it it
constituted upon the whole a pleasant dwelling
the smith instead knocking or calling
which would have drawn neighbours to
doors and windows drew out a passkey his
own fabrication then a great and envied curiosity
and opening the door his house introduced
his companion into his habitation
the apartment which received henry and
the gleemaiden was the kitchen which served
amongst those the smith's station for the family
bittingroom although one or two individuals
like simon glover had an eatingroom
apart from that in which their victuals were
prepared in the corner this apartment
which was arranged with an unusual attention
to cleanliness sat an old woman whose neatness
 attire and the precision with which her
scarlet plaid was drawn over her head so as to
descend to her shoulders on each side might
have indicated a higher rank than that luckier
shoolbred the smith's housekeeper yet such
and no other was her designation and not
having attended mass in the morning she was
quietly reposing herself by the side the fire
her beads half told hanging over her left arm 
her prayers half said loitering upon her tongue 
her eyes half closed resigning themselves to
slumber while she expected the return her
fosterson without being able to guess at what
hour it was likely to happen she started up
at the sound his entrance and bent her eye
upon his companion at first with a look the
utmost surprise which gradually was exchanged
for one expressive great displeasure
now the saints bless mine eyesight henry
smith she exclaimed very devoutly
amen with all my heart get some food
ready presently good nurse for i fear me this
traveller hath dined but lightly
m and again i pray that our lady would
preserve my eyesight from the wicked delusions
 satan 
so be it i tell you good woman but what
is the use all this pattering and praying 
do you not hear me or will you not do as i
bid you 
it must be himself then whatever is it 
but oh it is more like the foul fiend in his
likeness to have such a baggage hanging upon
his cloak o harry smith men called you a
wild lad for less things but who would ever
have thought that harry would have brought a
light leman under the roof that sheltered his
worthy mother and where his own nurse has
dwelt for thirty years 
hold your peace old woman and be 
said the smith this gleewoman
is no leman mine nor tiny other person
that i know but she is going off for dundee
tomorrow by the boats and we must give
her quarters till then
quarters said the old woman you
may give quarters to such cattle if you like it
yourself harry wynd but the came house
shall not quarter that trumpery quean and me
and that you may assure yourself
your mother is angry with me said louise
misconstruing the connexion the parties
i will not remain to give her any offence if
there is a stable or a townhouse an empty stall
will be bed enough for chariot and me
ay ay i am thinking it is the quarters you
arc best used to said dame shoolbred
hark ye nurse shoolbred said the smith
you know i love you for your own sake and
lor my mothers but by st dunstan who was
a saint my own craft i will have the command
 my own house and if you leave me
without any better reason but your own nonsensical
suspicions you must think how you
will have the door open to you when you return
 for you shall have no help mine i promise
you
avveel my bairn and that will never make
me risk the honest name i have kept for sixty
years it was never your mother's custom and
it shall never be mine to take up with ranters
and jugglers and singing women and i am not
so far to seek for a dwelling that the same roof
should cover me and a tramping princess like
that
with this the refractory gouvernante began
in great hurry to adjust her tartan mantle forgoing
abroad by pulling it so far forwards as
to conceal the white linen cap the edges 
which bordered her shrivelled but still fresh
and healthful countenance this done she seized
upon a staff the trusty companion her
journeys and was fairly trudging towards the
door when the smith stepped between her and
the passage
wait at least old woman till we have
cleared scores i owe you for fee and bounties

an that's e'en a dream your own fool's
head what feo or bounties am i to take from
the son your mother that fed clad and
yielded me as if i had been a sister 
and well you repay it nurse leaving her
only child at his utmost need
this seemed to strike the obstinate old woman
with compunction she stopped and looked
at her master and the minstrel alternately then
shook her head and seemed about to resume her
motion towards the door
i only receive this poor wanderer under
my roof urged the smith to save her from
the prison and the scourge
and why should you save her said the
inexorable dame shoolbred i dare say she
has deserved them both as well as ever thief
deserved a hempen collar
u for aught i know she may or she may not
but she cannot deserve to be scourged to death
or imprisoned till she is starved to death and
that is the lot them that the black douglas
bears mal talent against
and you are going to thraw the black
douglas for the sake a glee woman twill
be the worst your feuds yet oh henry
gow there is as much iron in your head as
in your anvil 
i bave sometimes thought this myself mistress
shoolbred but if i do get a cut or two on
this new argument i wonder who is to cure
them if you run away from me like a scared
wildgoose ay and moreover who is to receive
my bonny bride that i hope to bring up the
wynd one these days 
ah harry harry said the old woman
shaking her head this is not the way to prepare
an honest man's house for a young bride
you should be guided by modesty and discretion
and not by chambering and wantonness

i tell you again this poor creature is nothing
to me i wish her only to be safely taken
care and i think the boldest bordering in
perth will respect the bar my door as much
as the gate carlisle castle i am going down
to sim glover's i may stay there all night for
the highland cub is run back to the hills like
a wolf whelp as he is and so there is a bed to
spare and father simon will make me welcome
to the use it you will remain with this
poor creature feed her and protect her during
the night and i will call on her before day and
thou mayst go with her to the boat thyself an
thou wilt and so thou wilt set the last eyes on
her at the same time i shall
there is some reason in that said dame
shoolbred though why you should put your
reputation in risk for a creature that would find
a lodging for a silver twopence and less matter
is a mystery to me
trust me with that old woman and be
kind to the girl
kinder than she deserves i warrant you 
and truly though i little like the company 
such cattle yet i think i am less like to take
harm from her than you unless she be a witch
indeed which may well come to be the case as
the devil is very powerful with all this wayfaring
clanjamfray
no more a witch than i am a warlock
said the honest smith a poor brokenhearted
thing that if she hath done evil has creed a
sore weird for it be kind to her and yon
my musical damsel i will call on you tomor
row morning and carry you to the waterside
this old woman will treat you kindly if you
say nothing to her but what becomes honest
cars
the poor minstrel had listened to this dialogue
without understanding more than its
general tendency for though she spoke english
well she had acquired the language in
england itself and the northern dialect was
then as now a broader and harsher character
she saw however that she was to remain
with the old lady and meekly folding her arms
on her bosom bent her head with humility she
next looked towards the smith with a strong expression
 thankfulness then raising her eyes to
heaven took his passive hand and seemed about
to kiss the sinewy fingers in token deep and
affectionate gratitude but dame shoolbred
did not give license to the stranger's mode 
expressing her feelings she thrust in between
them and pushing poor louise aside said
u no no i'll have none that work go into
the chimney nook mistress and when harry
smith's gone if you must have hands to kiss
you shall kiss mine as long as you like and
you harry away down to sim glover's for if
pretty mistress catharine hears the company
you have brought home she may chance to
like them as little as i do what's the matter
now is the man demented are you going
out without your buckler and the whole town
in misrule 
you are right dame said the armourer 
and throwing the buckler over his broad shoulders
he departed from his house without gilding
farther question

the overwrought state helens feelings
was relieved by a walk with beauclerc not
in the dressed part the park but in what
was generally undiscovered country a dingle
a bosky dell which he had found out in his
rambles and which though so little distant
from the busy hum men had a wonderful
air romantic seclusion and stillness the
stillness evening it was a fine evening
though it was in the very autumn the
sun had not set its rich red light yet lingered
on the still remaining autumn tints upon the
trees the birds hopped fearlessly from bough
to bough as if this sweet spot were all their
own the cattle were quietly grazing blow
or slowly winding their way to the wateringplace

by degrees the sounds evening faded 
away upon the ear a faint chirrup here and
there from the few birds not yet gone to roost
and now only the humming the flies over
the water were to be heard
it was perfect repose and beauclerc and
helen sat down on the bank to enjoy it together
the sympathy the woman he loved
especially in his enjoyment the beauties 
nature was to beauclerc an absolute necessary
 life nor would he have been contented
with that show taste for the picturesque which
is as he knew merely one a modern young
lady's many accomplishments helenass taste
was natural and he was glad to feel it so true
and for him here alone expressed with such
peculiar heightened feeling as if she had in all
nature now a new sense delight
he had brought her here in hopes that she
would be struck with this spot not only because
it was beautiful in itself and his discovery
but because it was like another bushy
dell and bosky bourne which he had been
from childhood fond in another place which
he hoped she would soon be mistress soon 
i
helen 
very soon helen he repeated in a tone
which could not be heard by her with indifference

he said that some his friends in london
told him that the report their intended
union had been spread everywhere by lady
katrine hawksbyby probably as cecilia when
lady castlefort departed had confided to her
to settle her mind about beauclerc that he was
coming over as miss stanley's acknowledged
lover and since the report had been so
spread the sooner the marriage took place the
better at least it was a plea which beauclerc
failed not to urge and helen's delicacy failed
not to feel
she sighed she smiled the day was
named and the moment she consented to be
his nothing could be thought but him
yet even while he poured out all his soul 
while he enjoyed the satisfaction there is in
perfect unreservedness confidence helen
felt a pang mix with her pleasure she felt
there was one thing she could not tell him he
who had told her everything all his faults
and follies oh why thought she why

 helens
cannot i tell him everything i who have no
secrets my own why should i be forced to
keep the secrets another 
in confusion scarcely finished these ideas
came across her mind and she sighed deeply
beauclerc asked why and she could not tell
him she was silent and he did not reiterate
the indiscreet question he was sure she
thought lady davenant and he now spoke
 the regret he felt that she could not be
present at their marriage and lord davenant
too beauclerc said he had hoped that lord
davenant who loved helen as if she were his
own daughter would have been the person to
act as her father at the ceremony but the
general his friend and her's would now
beauclerc said give her to him and would
he was sure take pleasure in thus publicly
marking his approbation his ward's
choice
they rose and going on down the path to
the rivers side they reached a little cove
where he had moored his boat and they returned
home by water the moon just visible
the air so still all so placid so delightful 
helen 
and beauclerc so happy that she could not
but be happy yes quite happy too
they reached the shore just as the lamps
were lighting in the house as they went in
they met the general who said in good
time and he smiled on helen as she passed
 it is all settled whispered beauclerc to
him and you are to give her away
with pleasure said the general
as helen went upstairs she said to herself
 i understand the general's smile he thinks
i have followed his advice he thinks i have
told all and i i can only be silent
there was a great dinnerparty but the
general not thinking cecilia quite equal to it
had engaged mrs holdernesse a relation 
his own to do the honours the day
lady cecilia came into the drawingroom
in the evening but after paying her compliments
to the company she gladly followed
the general's advice and retired to the musicroom
helen went with her and beauclerc
followed lady cecilia sat down to play at
ecarte with him and helen tuned her harp
the general came in for a few minutes he
 helen
said to escape from two young ladies who had
half talked him dead about craniology he
stood leaning on the mantelpiece and looking
over the game
lady cecilia wanted counters and she
begged beauclerc to look for some which she
believed he would find in the drawer a
table that was behind him beauclerc opened
the drawer but no sooner had he done so than
in admiration something he discovered there
he exclaimed beautiful beautiful and how
like
it was the miniature helen and besides
the miniature further back in the drawer
lady cecilia saw how quick is the eye 
guilty fear could it be yes one 
the fatal letters the letter nothing but
the picture had yet been seen by the general
or by beauclerc lady cecilia stretched behind
her husband whose eyes were upon the miniature
and closed the drawer it was all
she could do it was impossible for her to
reach the letter
beauclerc holding the picture to the light
helen 
repeated beautiful who did it whom is it
for general look do you know it 
yes to be sure replied the general
miss stanley
you have seen it before 
yes said the general coldly
it is very like who did it 
i did it cried lady cecilia who now
recovered her voice
 you my dear lady cecilia whom for 
for me is it for me 
for you it may be hereafter perhaps
 oh thank you my dear lady cecilia 
cried beauclerc
if you behave well perhaps added she
the general heard in his wife's tremulous
tone and saw in her half confusion half attempt
at playfulness only an amiable anxiety
to save her friend and to give her time to
recover from her dismay he at once perceived
that helen had not followed the course
he had suggested that she had not told beauclerc
and did not intend that he should be
told the whole truth the general looked
 helen
extremely grave beauclerc gave a glance
round the room
here is some mystery said he now first
seeing helen's disconcerted countenance then
he turned on the general a look eager
inquiry some mystery certainly said
he with which i am not to be made acquainted

if there be any mystery said the general
 with which you are not to be made acquainted
i am neither the adviser nor abettor
neither in jest nor earnest am i ever an
adviser mystery
while her husband thus spoke lady cecilia
made another attempt to possess herself
 the letter this time she rose decidedly
and putting aside the little ecarte table which
was in her way pressed forward to the drawer
saying something about counters her
cashmere caught on helen's harp and in her
eager spring forward it would have been
overset but that the general felt turned and
caught it
 what are you about my dear cecilia 
what do you want 
helen 
nothing nothing thank you my dear 
nothing now
then she did not dare to open the drawer
or to let him open it and anxiously drew away
his attention by pointing to a footstool which
she seemed to want
 gould not you ask me for it my dear
without disturbing yourself what are men
made for p
beauclerc after a sort absent effort to
join in quest the footstool had returned
eagerly to the picture and looking at it more
closely he saw the letters c d written in
small characters in one comer and just as his
eye turned to the other corner lady cecilia
recollecting what initials were there started
up and snatched it from his hand
oh granville l cried she you must not
look at this picture any more till i have done
something to it
beauclerc was trying to catch another look
at it when cecilia cried out
take it helen take it and she held it
up on high but as she held it though she
b 
 helen
turned the face from him she forgot quite
forgot that colonel d'aubigny had written his
name on the back the picture and there
it was in distinct characters such as could
be plainly read at that height for henry
d'aubigny beauclerc saw and gave one
glance at helen he made no further attempt
to reach the picture
lady cecilia not aware what he had seen
repeated
helen helen why don't you take it 
snow now v
helen could not stir the general took the
picture from his wife's hand gave it to miss
stanley without looking at her and said to
lady cecilia
pray keep yourself quiet cecilia you
have done enough too much today sit
down said he rolling her armchair close and
seating her keep yourself quiet i beg
i beg in the tone i insist
she sat down but catching a view 
beauclerc was alarmed by his aspect and
helen her head was bent down behind the
harp lady cecilia did not know yet dishelen

tinct what had happened the general
pressed her to lean back on the cushions which
he was piling up behind her beauclerc made
a step towards helen but checking himself he
turned to the ecarte table
those counters after all that we were
looking for 
as he spoke he pulled open the drawer
the general with his back to him was standing
before lady cecilia she could not see what
beauclerc was doing but she heard the drawer
open and cried out
 not there beauclerc no counters there 
you need not look there
but before she spoke he had given a
sudden pull to the drawer which brought it
quite out and all the contents fell upon the
floor and there was the fatal letter open and
the words my dear too dear henry instantly
met his eyes he looked no farther but in
that single glance the writing seemed to him
to be lady cecilia and quick his eye turned
upon her she kept perfectly quiet and
appeared to him perfectly composed his eye
then darted in search helen she had sunk
is helen
upon a seat behind the harp lyirough the
harp strings he caught a glimpse her face
all pale crimsoned it grew as he advanced
she rose instantly took up the letter and
without speaking or looking at any one tore
it to pieces
beauclerc stood in motionless astonishment
lady cecilia breathed again the general's
countenance expressed i interfere no farther
 he left the room and beauclerc without
another look at helen followed him
for some moments after lady cecilia and
helen were left alone there was a dead silence
lady cecilia sat with her eyes fixed upon the
door through which her husband and beauclerc
had passed she thought that beauclerc
might return but when she found that he
did not she went to helen who had covered
her face with her hands
my dearest friends said lady cecilia
thank you thank you you did the best
that was possible 
 o cecilia exclaimed helen to what
have you exposed me 
how did it all happen continued cecilia


helen 
why was not that letter burnt with the rest 
how came it there can you tell me 
 i do not knows said helen i cannot
recollects but after some effort she remembered
that in the morning while the general
had been talking to her she had in her confusion
when she took the packet laid the picture
and that letter beside her on the arm the
chair she had in her hurry putting the
other letters into her bag forgotten this and
the picture and she supposed that they had
fallen between the chair and the wall and that
they had been found and put into the tabledrawer
by one the servants
helen was hastening out the room cecilia
detained her
do not go my dear for that would look
as if you were guilty and you know you are
innocent at the first sound your harp
beauclerc will return only command yourself
for one hour or twos
yes it will only be for an hour or two
said helen brightening with hope you
will tell the general tonight do you think
granville will come back where is the harp
if helen
key i dropped it there it is she began to
tune the harp
crack went one string then another
 that is lucky said lady cecilia it
will give you something to do my love if the
people come in
thb aidedecamp entered i thought i
heard harpstrings going said he
several yes said lady cecilia standing
full in his way
 inauspicious sounds for us bad omens
for my embassy mrs hpldemesse sent me
i know said lady cecilia and you will
have the goodness to tell her that miss stanley's
harp is unstrung
can i be any use miss stanley said
he moving towards the harp
 no no cried lady cecilia you are in
my service attend to me
dear me lady cecilia i did not hear
what you said
that is what i complain hear me
now
a
i am all attention i am sure what are
your commands 
i
i
helen 
she gave him as many as his head could
hold a long message to mrs holdernesse
and to miss holdernesse and miss anna about
their musicbooks which had been left in the
carriage and were to be sent for and duets
to be played and glees for the major and
lady anne ruthven
 good heavens i cannot remember any
more cried the aidedecamp
 then go off and say and do all that
before you come back against said lady cecilia

what amazing presence mind you
haven't said helen how can you say so
much and think everything 
the aidedecamp performed all her behests
to admiration and was rewarded by promotion
to the high office turnerover general the
leaves the music books an office requiring
as her ladyship remarked to miss holdernesse
prompt eye and ear and all his distinguished
gallantry by such compliments she fixed him
to the pianoforte while his curiosity and all
his feelings being subordinate to his vanity
were prevented from straying to miss stanley
mmmmmifi
 i 
 helen
and her harpstringing a work still doing 
still to do
all the arrangement succeeded as lady
ceciliass arrangements usually did helen
heard the eternal buzz conversation and the
clang instruments and then the harmony
 music all as in a dram or as at the
theatre when the thoughts are absent or the
feelings preoccupied and in this dreamy state
she performed the operation putting in
the harpstrings quite well and when she was
at last called upon by cecilia who gave her
due notice and time she sat and played automatically
without soul or spirit but so do so
many others it passed charmingly till a
door softly opened behind her and she saw the
shadow on the wall and some one stood and
passed from behind her there was an 
her playing however from her just dread 
making a scene she commanded herself so
powerfully thats except her timidity nothing
was observed by the company and that timidity
was pitied by the good natured mrs hole
who said to her daughter anne
we must not press miss stanley any more
helen 
she who is always so obliging is tired nowe
she then made way for helen to pass who
thanking her with such a look as might be
given for a life saved quitted the harp and
the crowd closing behind her happily thought
 her no more she retreated to the darkest
part the room and sat down she did not
dare to look towards what she most wished to
see her eyes were fixed upon the face the
young lady singing and yet she saw not one
feature that face while she knew without
looking or seeming to look exactly where
beauclerc stood he had stationed himself ina
doorway into the drawingroom there leaning
back against the wall he stood and never
stirred helen was so anxious to get one clear
view the expression his countenance that
at last she ventured to move a little and from
behind the broad back a great man she looked
 beauclerc's eyes met her's how different
from their expression when they were sitting on
the bank together but a few short hours before 
he left the doorway instantly and placed himself
where helen could see him no more
 all the rest what passed this evening
 helen
she knew nothing she felt only a sort astonishment
at everybody's gaiety and a sense 
the time being intolerably long she thought
that au these people never would go away 
that their carriages never would be announced
but before it came to that time general clarendon
insisted upon lady cecilias retiring
i must said he play the tyrant cecilia 
you have done too much today mrs holdernesse
shall hold your place
he carried cecilia off and helen thought
or fancied that he looked about for her old
to escape she followed close behind the
general did not offer his arm or appear to notice
her when she came to the door leading
to the staircase there was beauclerc standing
with folded arms as in the musicroom he
just bowed his head and wished lady cecilia
a good night and waited without a word for
helen to pass or not to pass as she thought
fit she saw by his look that he expected
explanation but till she knew what cecilia
meant to do how could she explain to say
nothing to bear to be suspected was all she
could do without betraying her friend that
helen 
word betray that thought ruled her she
passed him good night's she could not then
say he bowed as she passed and she heard
no good night no sound and there was
the general in the hall to be passed also
before she could reach the staircase up which
gedlia was going when he saw helen with
a look surprise as it seemed to her disapproving
surprise he said are you gone
miss stanley r
the look the tone struck cold to her heart
he continued though i drove cecilia
away i did not mean to drive you away too
it is early
 is it i thought it was very later
no and if you can i hope you will
returned there was meaning in his eye which
she well understood
thank you said she if i can certainly

i hope you can and wills
 oh thank you but i must first 
see cecilia she was going to say but afraid 
implicating her she changed the sentence to 
i must first consider 
i
 helen
consider what the devil t thought he
and his countenance was instantly angrily
suited to the thought
helen hesitated
do not let me detain distress you farther
miss stanley unavailingly and since i
shall not have the pleasure seeing you again
this evenings concluded he in a constrained
voice i have the honour to wish you a goodnight

he returned to the musicroom
helen 
chapter ii
helen instantly went to cecilia's room 
felicie was with her helen expected lady
cedoia would dismiss her instantly but mademoiselle
was chattering helen had sometimes
thought cecilia let her talk too much but tonight
it was insufferable helen was too impatient
too anxious to bear it cecilia my
dear i want to speak to you alone as soon as
you can in my own room
as soon as possible cecilia answered ina
voice not natural and she came but not
as soon as possible shut the door behind her
shewing that she had not dismissed felicie
and with hair dishevelled as if hastening back
to her room said i am in a hurry the
general ordered me to make haste and not to
be an hour undressing
i will not keep you a moments said
v
 helen
helen i am in as great a hurry as you can
be beauclerc is waiting for me
waiting for you at this time night 
oh my dear he cannot be standing there with
his arras folded all this time
helen repeated what the general had said
and ended with i am determined to return
no no lady cecilia said the general
could not advise her going back at this time 
night and with rapidity and confusion she
poured out a multitude dissuasive arguments
some contradicting the others
 at this time night the world is not
gone and beauclerc is in the midst them
by this time you may be sure you don't
think he is standing alone there all this time
you could not speak to him before all the
world don't attempt it you would only
expose yourself you would make a scene
at last indo all and come to disgrace and
ruin me and yourself i know you would
helen and if you were to send for him 
into the library alone the servants would
know it and the company gone and after
helen sall
for you my dear to make the first advance
to reconciliation if he is angry i
don't think that would be quite dignified
quite like you helen
 the general thinks it right and i am
sure he would not advise any thing improper
undignified it does not signify cecilia
i am determined i will go trembling
she grew absolutely desperate from fear
i am afraid you have forgot your promise
cecilia you said that if i could bear it for one
hour it would be over did not you promise
me that if any difficulty came between me
and she stopped short she had felt
indignant bu when she looked at cecilia and
saw her tears she could not go on
 oh helen r cried cecilia i do not ask
you to pity me you cannot know what i
suffer you are innocent and i have done so
wrong you cannot pity me
i do i dos cried helen from the bottom
 my heart only trust me dear cecilia 
let me go down 
lady cecilia sprang between her and the
t
 helen
door hear me i hear me helen do not
go tonight and cost what it will cost me
what it may since it has come to this between
you i will confess all this night will tell
all to the general and clear you with him
and with granville what more can you ask 
 what more can i do helen and will
you go 
no no my dear cecilia since you promise
me this i will not go nowe
 be satisfied then and rest for me there
is no rest so saying cecilia slowly left the
room
helen could not sleep this was the second
wretched night she had passed in that most
miserable all uncertainty whether she was
right or wrong
in the morning to helen's astonishment
celia's first words were about a dream oh
my dear helen i have had such a dream i
do not usually mind dreams in the least but i
must own to you that this has made an impression
 my dear i can hardly tell it i
can scarcely bear to think it i thought
that clarendon and i were sitting together and
f
helen 
my hand was on his shoulder and i had
worked myself up i was just going to speak
he was winding up his watch and i leaned
forward to see his face better he looked up
and it was not him it was colonel d'au
bigny come to life the door opened clarendon
appeared his eyes were upon me but i
do not know what came afterwards all was
confusion and fighting and then i was with
that nurse my mother recommended and an
infant in her arms i was going to take the
child when clarendon snatched it and threw
it into the flames oh i awoke with a
scream r
how glad you must have been said
helen to awake and find it was only a
dream 
 but when i screamed continued cecilia
 clarendon started up and asked if i was in
pain not body i said and then oh
helen then i thought i would begin not
 body i said but mind then i added
i was thinking helen and beauclerc clarendon
said so was i but there is no use in
thinking it we can do na good then
vol iii c
k
 helen
i said suppose clarendon only suppose
that helen without saying anything were
to let this matter pass off with beauclerc 
 clarendon answered it would not pass
off with beauclerk buts said i i do
not mean without any explanation at all only
suppose that helen did not enter into any
particulars do not you think clarendon that
things would go on well enough no he
said decidedly no do you mean said i
 that things would not go on at all i do
not say not at all he answered but well
they would not go on 
i am sure the general is rights said jejelen
then continued lady cecilia sen i
put the question differently i wanted to feel
my way to try whether i could possibly venture
upon my own confession consider it
this way clarendon's i said take it for
granted that helen did somehow arrange that
beauclerc were to be satisfied without any
formal explanation formal said he i
will not say formal said i but without a
full explanation in short suppose that from
mere timidity helen could not did not exam

helen 
aptly tell him the whole before marriage put
it off till afterwards then told him all candidly
 do you think clarendon that if you
were in beauclerc's place i quite stammered
when i came to this do you think you could
pardon or forgive or esteem or love i intended
to with but he interrupted me with
 i do not know very shortly and added
 i hope this is not what miss stanley intends
to do
oh what did you answer cried helen
 i said i did not know my dear helen
it was the only thing i could say what
would clarendon have thought after all my
supposes if i had said anything else he must
have seen the truth
 and that he is not to sees said helen 
 and how false he must think me 
no no for i told him continued lady
cecilia that i was sure you wished always
to tell the whole truth about every thing but
that there might be circumstances where you
really could not and where i knowing all
the circumstances could not advise it he
said cecilia i desire you will not advise orc

its
helen
interfere any farther in this matter promise
me cecilia he spoke sternly and i promised
as fast as i could do nothing say
nothing more about it he repeated and
now after that could i go on helen 
 no indeed i do not think you could
my dear cecilia i really think you could not
said helen much moved
and do you forgive me my dear good
 but seeing helen change colour lady
cecilia following her eye and looking out 
the window started up exclaiming there is
beauclerc i see him in my mother's walk
i will go to him this minute yes i will trust
him i will tell him all instantly
helen caught hold her and stopped her
surprised cecilia said do not step me i
may never have the courage again if stopped
now do not stop me helen
 i must cecilia general clarendon desired
you not to interfere in the matter
but this is not interfering only interposing
to prevent mischief
but cecilia continued helen eagerly
 another reason has just struck me
helen s
i wish reasons would not strike you let
me go oh helen it is for you
and it is for you i speak cecilia said
helen as fast as she could if you told
beauclerc you never could afterwards tell the
general it would be a new difficulty you
know the general could never endure your
having confessed this to any man but himself
trusted beauclerc rather than your husbands

cecilia stopped and stood silent
my dear cecilia continued helen you
must leave me to my own judgment now and
breaking from cecilia she left the room she
hurried out to meet beauclerc he stopped
on seeing her and then came forward with an
air evident deliberation
 o you wish to speak to me miss stanley 
 miss stanley cried helen is it come
to this and without hearing me 
without hearing you helen was not
i ready last night to hear you without
hearing you have not you kept me in torture
the worst tortures suspense why
did not you speak to me last night 
t
so helen
i could not
why why 
i cadet tell youy said she
then i can tell you helen
 you can 
and will helen you could not speak tome
till you had consulted arranged settled
what was to be said what not to be said 
what told what left untold
between each half sentence he darted looks
at her defying hers to contradict and she
could not contradict by word or look
you could not speak continued he passionately
 till you had well determined what
was to be told what left untold to mei
to me helen your confiding devoted accepted
lover for i protest before heaven
had i knelt at the altar with you helen stanley
not more yours not more mine could i
 have deemed you not more secure your
love and truth your truth for what is love
without it not more secure perfect felicity
could i have been on earth than i was when
we two sat together but yesterday evening
on that bank your words your looks 
helen 
aod still your looksbut what signify tears 
tears womens tears oh what is woman 
and what is man that believes in her
weaker still i
 hear me shear me r
 hear you no helen do not now ask
me to hear you do not force me to hear you
do not debase do not sully that perfect
image truth do not sink yourself hen
from that height at which it was my entranced
felicity to see you leave me okie blessed one
sacred illusion no cried he with increasing
vehemence say nothing all you have
prepared not one arranged word conned over
in your midnight and your morning consultations
pointing back to the window her
dressingroom where he had seen her and
lady cecilia
you saw helen began
yes am i blind think you i wish
i were oh that i could be gun the believing
fond happy dupe i was but yesterday
evening v
dupe r repeated helen but pour out
all all dear granville think say what
i
 helen
you will reproach abuse me as you please
it is a relief take it for i have none to give
none cried he his tone suddenly changing
 no relief to give what have you
nothing to say no explanation why
speak to me then at all 
 to tell you so at once to your suspense
 to tell you that i cannot explain the
midnight consultation and the morning were
not to prepare for you excuse or apology but
to decide whether i could tell you the whole 
and since that cannot be i determined not to
enter into any explanation i am glad that
you do not wish to hear any
 answer me one question said he that
picture did you give it to colonel d'au
bigny 
no that is a question i can answer
no he stole it from cecilia's portfolio ask
me no more
one queen 
one more i cannot tell you anything
more
she was silent for a moment he withdrew
his eyes and she went on
i
helen 
 granville i must now put your love and
esteem for me to the test if that love be
what i believe it to be if your confidence in
me is what i think it ought to be i am now
going to try it there is a mystery which i
cannot explain i tell you this and yet i
expect you to believe that i am innocent 
anything wrong but the concealment there
are circumstances which i cannot tell you
but why interrupted beauclerc 
ought there to be any circumstances which
cannot be told to the man to whom you have
plighted your faith away with this cannot
this mystery did not i tell you every
folly my life every fault and what is
this in itself nothing concealment 
 helen 
she was going to say if it concerned only
myself but that would at once betray cecilia
and she went on if it were in my
opinion right to tell it to you i would on
this point granville leave me to judge and
act for myself this is the test to which i
put your love put mine to any test you will
but if your confidence in me is not sufficient
c

s helen
to endure this trial we can never be happy
together
she spoke very low but beauclerc listened
with such intensity that he could not only
distinguish every syllable she said but could
distinctly hear the beating her heart which
throbbed violently in spite all her efforts to
be calm
 can you trust me concluded she
i cans cried he i can i do by
heaven i do i i think you an angel and
legions devils could not convince me the
contrary i trust your word i trust that
heavenly countenance i trust entirely 
he offered and she took his offered hand
i trust entirely not one question more
shall i ask not a suspicion shall i have you
put me to the test you shall find me stand
it
 can you said she you know how
much i ask i acknowledge a mystery and
yet i ask you to believe that i am not wrong
i knows said he you shall see and
both in happiness once more they returned to
the house
helen s
 i love her a thousand times better than
ever thought beauclerc for the independence
 mind she shews in thus braving my
opinion daring to set all upon the cast something
noble in this i am to form my own j judgment
 her and i will independently what
any other human being may say or think the
general with his strict narrow conventional
notions has not an idea the kind woman
i like or what helen really is he sees in
helen only the discreet properbehaved young
lady adapted so nicely adapted to her place
in society to pitch and notch in and to be 
no sort value out it give me a bang
able to stand alone to think and feel decide
and act for herself were helen only what
the general thinks her she would not be forme
while she is what i think her i love 
i adore and when he saw his guardian
beauclerc declared that though helen had
entered into no explanations he was perfectly
satisfied
the general answered i am glad you are
satisfied
beauclerc perceived that the general was
 helen
not and in spite all that he had just been
saying to himself this provoked and disgusted
him his theory his own mind if not quite
false was still a little at variance with his practice
his guardians opinion swayed him powerfully
whenever he believed that it was not
designed to influence him when the opinion
was repressed he could not rest without drawing
it out then you think general said
he that some explanation ought to have been
made 
no matter what i think granville the
affair is your's if you are satisfied that is all
that is necessary
then even because left on their own point
 suspension to vibrate freely the diamondscales
 beauclerc's mind began to move from
some nice unseen cause variation but
said he general clarendon no one can judge
without knowing facts
 so i apprehend said the general
i may be too easy faith replied beauclerc
 no reply this is a point honour
 no denial my dear general if
there be anything which weighs with you and
helen 
which you know and i do not i think as my
friend and my guardian you ought to tell it
to me
 pardon mess said the general turning
away from beauclerc as he spoke and striking
first one heel his boot against the scraper at
the halldoor then the other pardon me
granville i cannot admit you to be a better
judge than i am myself what i ought to door
not to do
the tone was dry and proud but beauclerk
provoked imagination conceived it to
be also mysterious the scales his mind
vibrated again but he had said he would trust
 trust entirely and he would yet he could
not succeed in banishing all doubt tiu an idea
started into his head that writing was lady
cecilia's i thought so at the first moment
and i let it go again it is heres and helen is
keeping her secret but could lady cecilia
be so ungenerous so treacherous however
he had declared he would ask no questions
 he was a man honour and he would
ask none none even himself a resolution
which he found it surprisingly easy to keep
 helen
when the doubt concerned only lady cecilia
whenever the thought crossed his mind he
said to himself i will ask nothing suspect
nobody but if it is lady ceciliass affair it is
all the more generous in helen and so
secure in this explanation though he never
allowed to himself that he admitted it his trust
in helen was easy and complete hib passion
for her increased every hour
but lady cecilia was disturbed even by the
perfect confidence and happiness beauclerk
manner towards helen she could not but
fear that he had guessed the truth and it
seemed as if everything which happened tended
to confirm him iu his suspicions for whenever
the mind is strongly interested on any subject
something alluding to it seems wonderfully yet
accidentally to occur in everything that we
read or hear in common conversation and soit
now happened things were continually said
by persons wholly unconcerned which seemed
to bear upon her secret lady cecilia frequently
felt this with pangs shame remorse
and confusion and though beauclerc did not
watch or play the spy upon her countenance
helen 
be could not help sometimes observing the
flitting colour the guilty changes counter
dance the assumed composure but soon she
either perceived that his attention twas directed
towards her or by practice she had acquired
more selfcommand for scarcely had he settled
his conviction when it was shaken by different
appearances lady cecilia's looks were now
when any dangerous allusions occurred directed
towards helen so as to turn beauclerk
suspicions from herself that mind once so artless
began to be degraded her spirits sank 
she felt that she had lost the sunshine a
soul without a mystery 
the day fixed for the marriage approached 
lady cecilia had undertaken the superintendence
 the trotlsseauf and felicie was in anxious
expectation its arrival helen had
written to the collingwoods to announce the
intended event asking for the good bishop's
sanction as her guardian and regretting that
he could not perform the ceremony she had
received from lady davenant a few lines written
just before she sailed warm with all the
enthusiasm her ardent heart and full 
 helen
expectation that helen's lot would be one 
the happiest this world could afford
all seemed indeed to smile upon her prospects
and the only clouds which dimmed the
sunshine were ceciliass insincerity and her feeling
that the general thought her acting unhandsomely
and unwisely towards his ward but she
consoled herself with the thought that he could
not judge what he did not know that she did
not deserve his displeasure that granville was
satisfied and if he was why should not general
clarendon be so too 
much more serious however was the pain
she felt on cecilia's account she reproached
herself with betraying the trust lady davenant
had reposed in her that dreadful prophecy
seemed now accomplishing cecilia's natural
generosity that for which helen had ever most
loved and admired her the brightest fairest
parts her character seemed failing now
what could be more selfish than cecilia's present
conduct towards herself more treacherous
to her nobleminded her confiding husband
the openness the perfect unreserve between
the two friends was no longer what it had
helen 
been helen however felt the constraint between
them the less as she was almost constantly
with beauclerc and in her young happiness
she hoped all would be right cecilia
would tell the general and they would be as
intimate as affectionate as they had ever been
one morning general clarendon stopping
cecilia as she was coming down to breakfast announced
that he was obliged to set off instantly
for london on business which could not be
delayed and that she must settle with miss
stanley whether they would accompany him
or remain at clarendon park he did not
know he said how long he might be detained
cecilia was astonished and excessively curious
 she tried her utmost address to discover
what was the nature his business in vain
all that remained was to do as he required
without more words he left the room and
cecilia decided at once that they had better
accompany him she dreaded some delay she
thought that if the general went alone to
town he might be detained heaven knows how
long and though the marriage must be postponed
at all events yet if they went with the
 helen
general the ceremony might be performed in
town as well as at clarendon park and she
with some difficulty convinced helen this
beauclerc feared nothing but delay they
were to go lady cecilia announced their decision
to the general who immediately set off
and the others in a few hours followed him
helen 
chapter iii
 in my youth and through the prime manhood i
never entered london without feelings hope and pleasure
it was to me the grand theatre intellectual activity
the field for every species enterprise and exertion
the metropolis the world business thought and action
there i was sure to find friends and companions
to hear the voice encouragement and praise there
society the most refined sort offered daily its banquets to
the mind and new objects interest and ambition were
constantly exciting attention either in politics literature or
science
these feelings so well described by a man
 genius have probably been felt more or less
by most young men who have within them any
consciousness talent or any that enthusiasm
that eager desire to have or to give
sympathy which especially in youth characterises
noble natures
but after even one or two seasons in a great
metropolis these feelings often change long
 helen
before they are altered by age granville
beauclerc had ahlady persuaded himself that
he now detested as much as he had at first
been delighted with a london life
from his metaphysical habits mind and
from the sensibility his temper he had been
too soon disgusted by that sort general politeness
which as he said takes up the time
and place real friendship and as for the intellectual
pleasures they were he said too superficial
for him and his notions independence
too were at this time quite incompatible
with the conventional life a great capital
his present wish was to live all the year round
in the country with the woman he loved and
in the society a few chosen friends
helen quite agreed with him in his taste for
the country she had scarcely ever known any
other life and yet had always been happy and
whatever youthful curiosity had been awakened
in her mind as to the pleasures london had
been now absorbed by stronger and more tender
feelings her fate in life she felt was fixed
and wherever the man she loved wished to reside
that she felt must be her choice with
i
i
r
r
helen 
these feelings they arrived at general clarendon's
delightful house in town
helens apartment and ceciliass were on
different floors and had no communication
with each other it was little consequence
as their stay in town was to be but short yet
helen could not help observing that cecilia
did not express any regret at it as formerly
she would have done it seemed a symptom 
declining affection which every the slightest
indication was marked and keenly felt by
helen the more so because she had anticipated
that such must be the consequence all that
had passed between them and there was now
no remedy
among the first morning visitors admitted
were lady castlefort and lady katrine
hawksbyby they did not as it struck cecilia
seem surprised to see that miss stanley was
miss stanley still though the day for the marriage
had been announced in all the papers as
fixed but they did seem now full curiosity
to know how it had come to pass and there
was rather too apparent a hope that something
was going wrong their first inquisitive look
a
 helen
was met by lady cecilia's careless glance in
reply which said better than words could
express
nothing the matter do not flatter yourselves

then her expertness at general answers
which give no information completely baffled
the two curious impertinents they could only
learn that the day for the marriage was not
fixed that it could not be definitively named
till some business should be settled by the
general
law business they supposed course
lady cecilia knew nothing about it lawyers
are such provoking wretches with their
fast bind fast find such an unconscionable
length time as they do take for their parchment
doings heeding nought that little impatient
flapper cupid
certain that lady cecilia was only playing
with their curiosity yet unable to circumvent
her lady katrine changed the conversation
and lady castlefort preferred a prayer which
was she said the chief object her visit that
lady cecilia and miss stanley would come to
j
helen 
her on monday die wn to have a few friends 
a very small party and independently the
pleasure she should have in seeing them it
would be advantageous perhaps to miss stane
ley as lady castlefort in her softest voice
added for from the marriage being postponed
even for a few days people might talk
and mr beauclerc and miss stanley appearing
together would prevent anybody's thinking
there was any little nothing so proper
now as for a young lady to appear with her
futur so i shall expect you my dear cecilia
and miss stanley and so saying she departed

helen's objections were au overruled and
when the engagement was made known to beauclerc
he shrugged and shrank and submitted 
observing that all men and all women must
from the moment they come within the precincts
 london life give up their time and
their will to an imaginary necessity going
when we do not like it where we do not wish
to see those whom we have no desire to see
and who do not care if they were never to see
us again except for the sake their own repute
helen
nation playing well their own parts in the
grand farce mock civilities
helen was sorry to have joined in making disengagement
for him which he seemed so much
to dislike but lady cecilia laughing maintained
that half his reluctance was affectation
and the other half a loverlike spirit monopoly
in which he should not be indulged and
instead pretending to be indifferent to what
the world might think he ought to be proud
to shew helen as a proof his taste
in dressing helen this night felicie excited
by her lady's exhortations displayed
her utmost skill mademoiselle felicie had
a certain petite metaphysical de toilette 
which she was justly vain she could talk
and as much to the purpose as most people 
le genre classique and le genre romanpiques
 the different styles dress that
suit different styles face and while she
worked and wondered at the work she made
she threw out from time to time her ideas on the
subject to form the taste helen's little maid
rose who in mute attention held the light
and assiduously presented pins
not your pin so fast one after de other
helen 
miss rose tenez tenez r cried mademoiselle
 you think in england alway too much
 your pin in your dress too little our
taste too little our elegance too much 
your what you call tidiness or god know what 
but never you mind dat so much miss rose 
and you not prim up your little mouth but
listen to me never you put in one pin before
you ask yourself miss rose what for i do it 
in every toilette that has taste there is above
all tenez a character a sentiment to
be support suppose your lady is to be
superbe or she will rather be elegant or
charmante or interessante or distinguish 
well dat is au er well and you dress to that
idee one or oder well very well but
none your wat you call odd no no never
miss rose that is not style noble twill
only become de petit minois your english
original i wash my hand dat always
the toilette superbe mademoiselle held to bethe
easiest all those which she had named
with favour it may be accomplished by any
common hands but head is requisite to reach
the toilette distinguish the toilette superbe
vol iii d
 helen
requires only cost a toilette distinguish demands
care
there was a happiness as well as care in
felicie's genius for dress which ever keeping
the height fashion in view never lost sight
 nature adapting selecting combining to
form a perfect whole in which art itself concealed
appeared only as she expressed it in
the sublime simplicity in the midst all
her talking however she went on with the ear
central business and as she finished pronounced
precepts commence exemple achieve
when they arrived at lady castlefort's
lady cecilia was surprised to find a line 
carriages and noise and crowds footmen
how was this she had understood that it
was to be one those really small parties
those select reunions some few the high
and mighty families who chance to be in town
before christmas but how is this p lady
cecilia repeated to herself as she entered the
hall amazed to find it blazing with light a
crowd on the stairs and in the anteroom a
crowd as she soon felt an unusual sort it
was not the soft crush aristocracy they
helen 
found hard unaccustomed citizen elbows
strange roundshouldered squarebacked men
and women so overdressed so bejewelled so
coarse shocking to see impossible to avoid 
not one figure one face lady cecilia had ever
seen before till at last from the midst the
throng emerged a fair form a being as it
seemed other mould certainly different
caste it was one ceciliass former intimates
lady emily greville whom she had not seen
since her return from abroad joyfully they
met and stopped and talked she was hastening
away lady emily said after having been
an hour on duty lady castlefort had made
it a point with her to stay after dinner she
had dined there and had stayed and now guard
was relieved
 but who are all these people p what is all
this my dear lady emily asked cecilia
 do not you know louisa has trapped
you into coming then tonight without telling
you how it is 
 not a word did she tell me i expected to
meet only our own worlds
a very different world you perceive this 
d
 helen
a sort farce this is to the double distress
a comedy in short one lord castleforts
brothers is going to stand for the city and
citizens and citoyennes must be propitiated
when an election is in the case all other things
give place and besides he has just married the
daughter some amazing merchant worth i
don't know how many plums so le petit
bossu who is proud his brother for he is
reckoned the genius the family made it a
point with louisa to do this she put up
her eyebrows and stood out as long as she
could but lord castlefort had his way for he
holds the purse you know and so she was
forced to make a party for these goths and
vandals and course she thought it best todo
it directly out season you know when
nobody will see it and she consulted me whether
it should be large or small i advised a
large party by all means as crowded as possible

yes yes i understand said cecilia 
 to hide the shame in the multitude vastly
well very fair all this except the trapping us
into it who have nothing to do with it
helen 
nothing to do with it pardon me cried
lady emily it could not have been done
without us entrapping us do not you
understand that we are the baits to the traps 
bringing those animals here wild beasts or
tame only to meet one another would have
been doing business no hows we are what
they are come for to see or to have it to
say that they have seen the exclusives exquisite
or transcendental or whatever else
they call us
 lady emily greville's carriage r was now
called in the anteroom
 i midst go but first make me known to
your friend miss stanley you see i know herby
instinct but lady emily greville's
carriage now resounded reiterated and gentlemen
with cloaks stood waiting and as she
put hers on lady emily stooped forward and
whispered
i do not believe one word what they
say hers and she was off and lady cecilia
stood for an instant looking after her and
considering what she could mean by those
last words concluding however that she
 helen
had not heard aright or had missed some
intervening name and that these words in
short could not possibly apply to helen
lady cecilia turned to her they resumed
their way onward and at length they reached
the grand receptionroom
in the middle that brilliantly lighted
saloon immediately under the centre chandelier
was ample verge and space enough re
served for the elite the world circle it was
not nor square nor form regularly defined yet
the bounds were guarded there was no way
 getting to the further the saloon or to
the apartments open in the distance beyond it
except by passing through this enclosed space
in which one fair entrance was practicable
and one sample exit full in view on the opposite
side several gentlemen fashionable
bearing held the outposts this privileged
place at back sofa or side fauteuil stationary
or wandering near some chosen few
were within a caryatides gentleman leaned on
each side the fireplace and in the centre 
the rug stood a remarkably handsome man 
fine figure perfectly dressed his whole air exhelen

exquisitely scornful excruciatingly miserable and
loftily abstract
twad wonderful was strange twas passing
strange how one so lost to all sublunary
concerns so far above the follies inferior
mortals as he looked came here so extremely
welldressed too how happened
it so nauseating the whole as he seemed
 so wishing that the business the world were
done 
with halfclosed dreamy eyelids he looked
silent down upon two ladies who sat opposite
to him rallying abusing and admiring him to
his vanities content
they gave him his choice three names
rnnuy le frondeur or le blast
lennuy he shook his head t common
he would have none it
le frondeur no too much trouble he
shrugged his abhorrence
le blast he allowed might be too true
but would they hazard a substantive verb p
he would give them fourandtwenty hours to
consider anh be would take twentyfour himself
to decide they should have his definite
helen
time tomorrow and he was sliding away but
lady castlefort as he passed her cried
 going lord beltravers going are you 

in an accent surprise and disappointment 
and she whispered i am hard at work here
acting receiver general to these city worthies 
and you do not pity me cruel l's and she
looked up with languishing eyes that so begged
for sympathy he threw upon her one look
 commiseration reproachful
pity you yes but why will you do these
things and why did you bring me here to do
this horrid sort work and he vanished
lady cecilia clarendon and miss stanley
now appeared in the offing and now reached
the straits lady castlefort rose with vivacity
extraordinary and went forward several steps
 dear cecilia miss stanley so good 
mr beauclerc so happy the general could
not so sorry then with hand pressed on
heres miss stanley so kind you to come
lady grace give me leave miss stanley 
lady grace bland and in a whisper lord
beltravers aunt
lady grace with a haughty drawback
helen 
motion and a supercilious arching her
brows was
happy to have the honour honour
sally prolonged and some guttural sounds
followed but further words if words they
were which she syllabled between snuffling and
mumbling were utterly unintelligible and
helen without being very happy or happy
at all only returned bend for bend
lady cecilia then presented her to a group
 sister graces standing near the sofas 
mammas and chaperons not each a different
grace but similar each indeed upon the very
same identical pattern air younglady
fashion wellbred and apparently wellnatured
no sooner was miss stanley made
known to them by lady cecilia than smiling
just enough not a muscle too much they
moved the ranks opened softly but sufficiently
and helen was in the group amongst them
but not them and this she became immediately
sensible though without knowing
how or why
one these daughters had had expectations
last season from having been frequently mr
d
 helen
beauclerc's partner and the mother was now
fanning herself opposite to him but helen
knew nought this to lev all was apparently
soft smooth and smiling while
whenever any the unprivileged multitude
the city monsters passed near this highborn
highbred group they looked as though the
rights pride were infringed and smiling
scorn they dropped from halfclosed lips
such syllables withering contempt as they
thought these vulgar victims merited careless
if they heard or not rather rejoicing to
see the sufferers wince beneath the wounds
which they inflicted in their pride and pomp
 sway
pride thought helen was it pride 
if pride it was how unlike what she had been
taught to consider the proper pride aristocracy
 how unlike that noble sort which she
had seen admired and loved helen fancied
what lady davenant would have thought how
ignoble how mean how vulgar she would have
considered these sneers and scoffs from the
nobly to the lowly born how unworthy 
their rank and station in society they who
helen 
ought to be the first in courtesy because the
first in fashion they who ought to form the
bright links between rank and rank in society
thus rudely severing them asunder and for
what the petty selfish vulgar triumph 
the moment
as these thoughts passed rapidly in helen's
mind she involuntarily looked towards beauclerc
but she was so encompassed by her
present companions that she could not discover
him had she been able to see his
countenance she would have read in it at
once how exactly he was at that instant feeling
with her more indignant than herself
for his high chivalrous devotion to the fair
could ill endure the readiness with which the
gentlemen attendants at ottoman or sofa lent
their aid to mock and to embarrass every
passing party the city tribe mothers and
their hapless daughtertrain
at this instant lady bancroft who if she
had not good breeding certainly had goodnature
came up to beauclerc and whispered
earnestly and with an expression strong
interest in her countenance
 helen
as you love her do not heed one word
you hear anybody say this night for it's all
on purpose to vex you and ain as certain
as you are it's all false all envy and there
she goes envy herself in the black jaundiced
continued she looking at lady katrine
hawksbyby who passed at that instant
good heavens l cried beauclerc what
can 
no no interrupted lady bancroft
no no do not ask better not best you
should know no more only keep your temper
whatever happens go you up the hill like
the man in the tale and let the black stones
bawl themselves hoarse dumb go you on
and seize your pretty singing thinking bird 
the sooner the better so fare you well
and she disappeared in the crowd beauclerc
to whom she was perfectly unknown
though she had made him out totally at a
loss to imagine what interest she could take in
helen or in him or what she could possibly
mean rather inclined to suppose she was a madwoman
and he forgot everything else as he
saw helen with lady cecilia emerging from
helen 
the bevy young ladies and approaching
him
they stopped to speak to some acquaintance
and he tried to look at helen as if he were an
indifferent spectator and to fancy what he
should think her if he saw her now for
the first time he thought that he should
be struck not only with her beauty but with
her graceful air her ingenuous countenance
so expressive the freshness natural sensibility
she was exquisitely well dressed too
and that as felicie observed goes for much
even with your most sensible men altogether
he was charmed whether considering her as
with the eyes an unblessed stranger or with
his own and all he heard confirmed and although
he would not have allowed it strengthened
his feelings he heard it said that though
there were some as handsome women in the
room there were none so interesting and some
 the young men added as lovely as lady
blanche but with more expressions a citizen
with whom beauclerc could have shaken
hands on the spot said there s one the
highbred now that s wellbred too
 helen
in the height the rapture his feelings
he overtook lady cecilia who telling him
that they were going on to another room delivered
helen to his care and herself taking
the arm some ready gentleman they proceeded
as fast as they could through the crowd
to the other the room
this was the first time helen had ever seen
lady cecilia in public where certainly she
appeared to great advantage not thinking
about herself but ever willing to be pleased so
bright so gay she was as sunshine which seemed
to spread its beams wherever she turned and
she had something to say to everybody or to
answer quick to whatever they said or looked
happy always in the apropos the moment
little there might be perhaps in what she
said but there was all that was wanted just
what did for the occasion in others there
often appeared a distress for something to say
or a dead dullness countenance opposite to
you from others a too fast hazarded broadside
 questions and answers glads and sorry
in chainshots that did no execution because
there was no good aim congratulations
helen s
and condolences playing at cross purposes 
these were mistakes misfortunes which could
never occur inlady gecilias natural grace and
acquired tact manner
helen was amused as she followed her in
watching the readiness with which she knew
how to exchange the necessary counters in the
commerce society she was amused till her
attention was distracted by hearing as she and
beauclerc passed the whispered words 
pramessi sposilook la belujiancee these
words were repeated as they went on and
lady cecilia heard some one say i thought
it was broken off that was all slander then 
she recollected lady emily words and terrified
lest helen should hear more she knew
not what she began to talk to her as fast as
she could while they were stopped in the doorway
by a crowd she succeeded for the moment
with helen she had not heard the last
speech and she could not as long as lady
cecilia spoke hear more but beauclerc again
distinguished the words belle fiancee t and
as he turned to discover the speaker a fat
matron near him asked who is it and the
 helen
daughter answered it is that handsome girl
with the white rose in her hairs hush l
said the brother on whose arm she leaned 
 handsome is that handsome does
handsome does thought beauclerc and
the mysterious warning his unknown friend
recurred to him he was astonished alarmed
furious but the whispering party had passed
on and just then lady cecilia descrying mr
churchill in the distance she made towards
him conversation sure to be had in abundance
from him he discerned them from
afar and was happily prepared both with a
ready bit wit and with a proper greeting
his meeting with lady cecilia was course
just the same as ever he just took it up
where he left off at clarendon park no difference
no hiatus his bow to beauclerc and
helen to helen and beauclerc joined in one
little sweep a congratulatory motion was
incomparable it said everything that a bow
could say and more it implied such a happy
freedom from envy or jealousy such a polite
acquiescence in the decrees fate such a
helen 
philosophic indifference such a cool sarcastic
superiority to the event and he began to
lady cecilia with one his prepared impromptus

at the instant your ladyship came up i
am afraid i started actually in a trance i do
believe methought i was where do you
think in the temple jaggernaut
why said lady cecilia smiling
methought continued horace that i
was in the temple jaggernaut that one
strange day in the year when all castes meet
when all distinction castes and ranks is forgotten
the abomination mixing them all
together permitted for their sins no doubt 
high caste and low from the abandoned paria
to the brahmin prince from their billingsgate
and warrington without suppose up to their
st james's street and grosvenor square
mingle mingle ye who mingle may white
spirits and grey black spirits and blue now
pray look around is not this jaggernaut night
with lady castlefort 
and you said lady cecilia are not

 helen
you the great jaggernaut himself driving overall
in your triumphant chariot sarcasm and
crushing all the victims in your way 
this took with horace it put him inspirits
in train and he fired away at lady
castlefort whom he had been flattering
d voutrance five minutes before
 i so admire that acting sacrifice in your
belle iousine tonight pasta herself could not
do it better there is a look oh ye just
gods what a victim am iv and with those
upturned eyes so charming i well and seriously
it is a sad sacrifice fathers have
flinty hearts by parental prescription but husbands
 petit bosses especially should have
mercy for their own sakes they should not
strain their marital power too fares
buts said lady cecia it is curious
that one born and bred such an ultra exclusive
as louisa castlefort should be obliged after
her marriage immediately to open her doors
and turn ultra liberal or an universal suffrages
all in consequence these mesalliances
true true said churchill with a solemn
pathetic shake the head gentlemen and
helen 
noblemen should consider before they make
these low matches to save their studs or their
souls or their entailed estates whatever bethe
necessity there can be no apology for outraging
all instance necessity has no law
but it should have some decency think 
bringing upon a foolish elder brother but
we won be personal
no don't pray horace said lady cecilia
moving on
 but think only think my dear lady
cecilia think what it must be to be 
and to be dear sister by such
bodies as these in public 
sad sad said lady cecilia
the old french nobility continued
churchill used to call these low moneymatches
 mettre du fumier sur nos terres 
dirty work at best said lady cecilia
but still said horace it might be
done with'decency if not with majesty
but in the midst all this said lady
cecilia i want some ice very much for myself
and for helen more
i have a notion we shall find some here
ki
 helen
replied he if you will come on this way 
in this sanctum sanatorium lady katrines
he led them on to a little inner apartment
where as he said lady katrine hawksbyby and
her set do always scandal take and sometimes
tea tea and ponce continued he you
know in london now is quite a la franchise
and it is astonishing to me who am but a man
what strong punch ladies can take
 only when it is iced said lady cecilia
smiling
 be it so said he very refreshing
ice and more refreshing scandal and here we
have both in perfection scandal hot and hot
and ice cold and cold
by this time they had reached the entrance
to what he called lady katrine's sanctum sane
or um where she had gathered round the iced
punch and teatable a select party whom she
had drawn together with the promise the
other half a halfpublished report a report
in which process spot and la
belle jiancie were implicated 
stop here one moment cried churchill
one moment longer let us see before we
r
r
i
helen 
are seen look id look in pray at this group
lady katrine herself on the sofa finger up 
holding forth and the deaf old woman stretching
forward to hear while the other with the
untasted punch sits suspended in curiosity
 what can it be she says or seems to say
now now see the pretty one's hands and eyes
uplifted and the ugly one with that look 
horror is exclaiming you don't say so my
dear lady katrine admirable creatures 
cant and scandal personified i wish wilkie
were here worth any money to him
and he should call it the scandal party 
said lady cecilia he told me he never could
venture upon a subject unless he could give it a
good name's
at this moment lady katrine having finished
her story rose and awaking from the abstraction
 malice she looked up and saw
helen and lady cecilia and as she came forward
churchill whispered between them
now now we are going comfortably to
enjoy no doubt madame de seine's pleasure
 de mal dire du pirochain at the right hour too
churchill left them there lady katrine
 helen
welcoming her victims her unsuspicious victims
 he slid off to the friends round the teatable
to learn from cant what scandal
had been telling beauclerc was gone to inquire
for the carriage the instant helen
appeared all eyes were fixed upon her and
 belle fiancee was murmured round and
cecilia heard he's much to be pitied
at this moment lord castlefort went up to
helen she had always been a favourite his 
he was grateful to her for her constant kindness
to him and peevish though the little man
might be he had a good heart and he shewed it
now by instantly taking helen out the midst
 the starers and begging her opinion upon
a favourite picture his a madonna was
it a raffaelle or was it not he and mr
churchill he said were at issue about it in
short no matter what he said it engrossed
helen's attention so that she could not hear
anything that passed and could not be seen
by the starers and he detained her in conversation
till beauclerc came to say the marriage
is ready lady cecilia is impatient
lord castlefort opened a door that led at
helen 
once to the staircase so that they had not to
recross all the rooms but got out immediately
the smallest service merits thanks and helen
thanked lord castlefort by a look which he
appreciated
even in the few words which beauclerc had
said as he announced the carriage she had perceived
that he was agitated and as he attended
her in silence down the stairs his look was
grave and preoccupied she saw he was displeased
and she thought he was displeased
with her when he had put them into the
carriage he wished them good night
 are not you coming with us cried lady
cecilia
 no he thanked her he had rather walk
and he added i shall not see you at
breakfast i am engaged
home said lady cecilia drawing up
the glass with a jerk
helen looked out anxiously beauclerc had
turned away but she caught one more glance
 his face as the lamp flared upon it she
saw and she was sure that something is
very much the matter i am certain it
l
 helen
nonsense my dear helen said lady cecilia
 the matter is that he is tired to death
as i am sure i am
 there's more than that's said helen he
is angry and he sighed
 now helen do not torment yourself about
nothing said cecilia who not being sure whether
beauclerc had heard anything had not
looked at his countenance or remarked his
tone her mind was occupied with what led
passed while helen was looking at the madonna
lady cecilia had tried to make out the
meaning these extraordinary staring and
whisperings lady katrine would not tell
her anything distinctly but said
strange reports so sorry it had got into
the papers those vile libellous papers course
she did not believe miss stanley after
all nothing very bad a little awkward only
might be hushed up better not talk it
tonight but i will try cecilia in the morning
to find those paragraphs for you
lady cecilia determined to go as early as
possible in the morning and make out the
whole and had she plainly told this to helen
i
helen 
it would have been better for all parties but
she continued to talk the people they had
seen to hide her thoughts from helen who
all the time felt as in a feverish dream watching
the lights the carriage flit by like fiery
eyes while she thought only the strange
words she had heard and why they should
have made beauclerc angry with her
at last they were at home as they went
in lady cecilia inquired if the general had
come in yes he had been at home for
some time and was in bed this was a relief
helen was glad not to see any ones or to be
obliged to say anything more that night lady
cecilia bade her be a good child and goto
sleep how much helen slept may be
left to the judgment those who have any
imagination

chapter iv
 m iladi a une migraine affreuse this mornings
said felicie addressing herself on the
stairs to rose mille amities de sa part to
your young lady miss rose and miladi recommend
to her to follow a good example and to
take her breakfast in her bed and then to take
one good sleep till you shall hear midi sonnet
miss stanley however was up and dressed
at the time when this message was brought to
her and a few minutes afterwards a footman
came to the door to give notice that the
general was in the breakfastroom waiting to
know whether miss stanley was coming down
or not the idea a têteàtête breakfast
with him was not now quite so agreeable as it
would have been to her formerly but shee went
down the general was standing with his
back to the fire newspapers hanging from his
helen 
hand his look ominously grave after good
mornings had been exchanged with awful
solemnity helen ventured to hope that there
was no bad public news
 no public news whatever said the general
next she was sorry to hear that cecilia had
 such a bad headache 
tired last night said the general
 it was indeed a tiresome disagreeable
party said helen hoping this would lead to
how so or why but the general drily answered
 not the london seasons and went
on eating his breakfast in silence
a constraint and awe came upon her
that she felt it would be taking too great a
liberty in his present mood to put sugar and
cream into his tea as she was wont in happier
times she set sugarbowl and cream before
him and whether he understood or noticed
not her feelings she could not guess he
sugared and creamed and drank and thought
and spoke not helen put out his way a
supernumerary cup to which he had already
given a push and she said mr beauclerc
does not breakfast with us
e 
 helen
so i suppose said the general as he
not here
lie said he was engaged to breakfast
 with some his friends i suppose said
the general
there the dialogue came to a full stop and
breakfast uncomfortably on her part and with
a preoccupied air on his went on in absolute
silence at length the general signified to the
servant who was in waiting by a nod and a
look towards the door that his further attendance
was dispensed with at another time helen
would have felt such a dismissal as a relief for
she disliked and recollected that her uncle
particularly disliked the fashion having servants
waiting at a family breakfast which he
justly deemed unsuited to our good old english
domestic habits but somehow it happened
that at this moment she was rather sorry when
the servant left the room he returned however
in a moment with something which he fancied
to be yet wanting the general after glancing
at whatever he had brought said that
will do cockburn we want nothing more
cockbum placed a skreen between him and
helen 
the fire the general put it aside and looking
at him said sternly gockburn no intelligence
must ever go from my house to any
newspapers
cockburn bowed none shall sir if
i can prevent it none ever did from me
general
 none must ever go from any one in my
family look to it
cockburn bowed again respectfully but with
a look reservation right remonstrance
answered by a look from his master no
more must be said yet cockburn was a
favourite he had lived in the family from
the time he was a boy he moved hastily
towards the door and having turned the handle
rested upon it and said general i cannot
answer for others
then cockburn i must find somebody
who can
cockburn disappeared but after closing the
door the veteran opened it again stood and
said stoutly though seemingly with some impediment
in his throat general clarendon
do me the justice to give jne full powers
 helen
 whatever you require say such are your
orders from me and that you have full power
to dismiss whoever disobeys cockburn bowed
and withdrew satisfied
another silence when the general hastily
finishing his breakfast took up the newspaper
and said
i wished to have spared you the pain 
seeing these miss stanley but it must be
done now
 there have appeared in certain papers
paragraphs alluding to beauclerc and to you 
these scandalous papers i never allow to enter
my house but i was informed that there were
such paragraphs and i was obliged to examine
into them i am sorry to find that
they have some them been copied into my
paper today
he laid the newspaper before her the
first words which struck her eye were the
dreaded whispers last night the paragraph
was as follows 
in a few days will be published the memoirs
 the late colonel d comprising
anecdotes and original loveletters
helen 
which will explain the mysterious allusions
lately made in certain papers to la belle
fiancee and jpromessi sposu 
what exclaimed helen the letters 
published 
the general had turned from her as she
read and had gone to his writingdesk which
was at the furthest the room he unlocked
it and took from it a small volume
and turning over the leaves as he slowly approached
helen he folded down some pages
laid the volume on the table before her and
then said
 before you look into these scandalous memoirs
miss stanley let me assure you that
nothing but the necessity being empowered
by you to say what is truth and what is falsehood
could determine me to give you this
shocks
she was scarcely able to put forward her
hand yet took the opened it looked at
it saw letters which she knew could not be
cecilias but turning another leaf she pushed
it from her with horror it was the letter 
beginning with my dear too dear henry
 helen
 in print i cried she in print published

not published yet that i hope to be able
to prevents said the general
whether she heard whether she could hear
him he was not certain her head was bent
down her hands clasping her forehead he
waited some minutes then sitting down beside
her with a voice gentleness and 
commiseration yet steady determination he
went on
i must speak and you mit hear me
helen for your own sake and for beauclerk
sake
 speak cried she i hear
hear then the words a friend who will
be true to you through life through life and
death if you will be but true to yourself
helen stanley a friend who loves you as he
loves beauclerc but he must do more he must
esteem you as he esteems beauclerc incapable
 anything that is false
helen listened with her breath suspended
not a word in reply
then i ask 
helen 
she put her hand upon his arm as if to
stop him she had a foreboding that he was
going to ask something that she could not
without betraying cecilia answer
if you are not yet sufficiently collected
i will wait take your own time my question
is simple i ask you to tell me whether all
these letters are your's or not 
 no cried helen these letters are not
mine
 not all said the general this first one
i know to be yours because i saw it in your
handwriting but i am certain all cannot be
yours now will you shew me which are and
which are not
i will take them to my own room and
consider and examine
 why not look at them here miss stanley 
she wanted to see cecilia she knew she
could never answer the question without consulting
her but that she could not say still she
had no other resource so conquering her trembling
she rose and said i would rather
goto 
not to cecilia said he to that i 

 helen
sect what can cecilia do for you what can
she advise but what i advise that the plain
truth should be told 
 if i could o if i could cried helen
 what can you mean pardon me miss
stanley but surely you can tell the plain fact 
you can recollect what you have written at
least you can know what you have not written
you have not yet even looked beyond a few
 the letters pray be composed be yourself
this business it was that brought me to
town i was warned by that young lady that
poetess mr churchill's whom you made
your friend by some kindness at clarendon
park i was warned that there was a 
to come out these memoirs colonel d'au
bigny which would contain letters said to be
yours a publication that would be highly injurious
to you i need not enter into details
 the measures i consequently took but i
ascertained that sir thomas d'aubigny the
elder brother the colonel knows nothing
more the matter than that he gave a manuscript
 his brother which he had never
read to be published the rest is a miserable
helen 
intrigue between booksellers and literary manufacturers
i know not whom i have not been
able to get to the bottom it sufficient for
my present purpose i know and must tell you
you have enemies who evidently desire to destroy
your reputation course to break your
marriage for this purpose the slanderous
press has been set at work the gossiping
part the public has had its vile curiosity
excited the publication this is expected
in a few days this is the only copy yet completed
i believe and this i could not get from
the bookseller till this morning i am now going
to have every other copy destroyed directly
oh my dear dear friend how can i thank
you
her tears gushed forth
 thank me not by words helen but by
actions no tears summon your soul be yourself

 o if i could but retrieve one false step 
she suddenly checked herself he stood aghast
for an instant then recovering himself sl he
looked upon her and marked the nature her
emotion he said 
 helen
 there can be no false step that you could
ever have taken that cannot be retrieved
there can have been nothing that is irretrievable
except falsehoods
falsehood no cried she i will not
say what is false therefore i will not say anything

 then since you cannot speaks continued
the general will you trust me with the letters
themselves have you brought them to
town with you 
the original letters 
yes those in the packet which i gave to
you at clarendon park 
 they are burned
all one this first letter i saw you tear 
did you burn all the rest 
they are burned repeated she colouring
all over she could not say burned them
he thought it a poor evasion they are
burned continued he that is you burned
then unfortunate i must then recur to my
first appeal take this pencil and mark i
pray you the passages that are your's i maybe
called on to prove the forgery these pashelen

sages if you do not shew me and truly which
are yours and which are not how can i answer
for you helen 
one hours said helen only leave me
for one hour and it shall be donee
why this cowardly delay 
i ask only one hour only leave me for
one hour
 i obey miss stanley since it must be so
i am gone
he went and helen felt how sunk she
was in his opinion sunk for ever she feared 
but she as yet could not think distinctly her
mind was stunned she felt that she must wait
for somebody but did not at first recollect
clearly that it was for cecilia she leaned
back on the sofa and sank into a sort 
dreamy state how long she remained thus
unconscious she knew not but she was roused
at last by the sound as she fancied a
carriage stopping at the door she started up
but it was gone or it had not been she perceived
that the breakfast things had been removed
and turning her eyes upon the clock
she was surprised to see how late it was she
 helen
snatched up the pages which she hated to
touch and ran upstairs to cecilia's room
door bolted she gave a hasty tap no
answer another louder no answer she ran
into the dressingroom for felicie who came
with a face mystery and the smile triumphant
 one who knows what is not to be
known but the smile vanished on seeing miss
stanley's face
bon dieu miss stanley how pale mais
quest ce que c'est mon dieu quest ce que
c'est done 
is lady cecilias door bolted within side 
said helen
no only lock by me said mademoiselle
felicie miladi charge me not to tell you
she was not dere and i had de presentiment
you might go up to look for her in her room
her head is got better quite she is au up
and dress she is gone out in the carriage and
virile soon be back no doubt i know not to
where she go but in my opinion to my lady
katrine if you please you not mention i say
dat as miladi charge me not to speak dis
to you apparemment quelque petit myslere

helen 
poor helen felt as if her last hope was gone
and now in a contrary extreme from the dreamy
torpor in which she had been before she was
seized with a nervous impatience for the arrival
 cecilia though whether to hope or fear
from it she did not distinctly know she went
to the drawingroom and listened and listened
and watched and watched and looked at the
clock and felt a still increasing dread that
the general might return before lady cecilia
and that she should not have accomplished her
promise she became more and more impatient
as it grew later the rolling carriages increased
and their noise grew louder and continually
as they came near she expected that one
would stop at the door
she expected and expected and feared and
grew sick with fear long deferred at last one
carriage did stop and then came a thundering
knock louder she thought than usual but
before she could decide whether it was cecilia
or not the roomdoor opened and the servant
had scarcely time to say that two ladies who
did not give their names had insisted upon
being let up when the two ladies entered

t 
 helen
one in the extreme foreign fashion but
an englishwoman assured and not prepossessing
appearance the other half hid behind
her companion and all timidity struck
helen as the most beautiful creature she had
ever beheld
a thousand pardons for forcing your
doors said the foremost lady but i bear
my apology in my hand a precious little box
 roman cameos from a friend lady cecilia
clarendon's which i was desired to deliver
myself
helen was course sorry that lady cecilia
was not at home
 i presume i have the honour speaking
to miss stanley continued the assured lady
and she gave her card comtesse de st cymons
then halfturning to the beauty who
now became visible allow me to mention 
lady blanche foresters
at that name helen did not start but she
felt as if she had received an electric shock
how she went through the necessary forms 
civility she knew not but even in the agony
 passion the little habits life hold their
helen 
sway the customary motions were made and
words pronounced yet when helen looked at
that beautiful lady blanche and saw how
beautiful there came a spasm at her heart
the comtesse in answer to her look towards
a chair did not choose to sit down 
could not stay would not intrude on miss
stanley so they stood helen supporting
herself as best she could and preserving apparently
perfect composure seeming to listen
to what farther madame de st cymon was
saying but only the sounds reached her ear
and a general notion that she spoke the
box in her hand she gave helen some message
to lady cecilia explanatory her waiting
or not waiting upon her ladyship to all
which helen answered with proper signs 
civility and while the comtesse was going
on she longed to look again at lady blanche
but dared not she saw a half curtsey and a
receding motion and she knew they were
going and she curtsied mechanically she felt
inexpressible relief when madame de st cymon
turned her back and moved towards the door
then helen looked again at lady blanche
 helen
and saw again her surpassing beauty and perfect
tranquillity the tranquillity gave her
courage it passed instantaneously into herself
through her whole existence the comtesse
stopped in her way out to look at a
china table ha beautiful sfivre 
enamel by jaquetot is it not 
helen was able to go forward and answer to
all the questions asked not one word from
the lady blanche but she wished to hear the
sound her voice she tried she spoke to
her but to whatever helen said no answer
came but the sweetest smiles the comtesse
with easy assurance and impertinent illbreeding
looked at all that lay in her way and
took up and opened the miniature pictures that
were on the table
 lady cecilia clarendon charming 
blanche you never saw her yet quite charming
is not it 
not a word from lady blanche but a smile
a guido smile another miniature taken up
by the curious comtesse ah very like
indeed not flattered though do you know
it blanche eh 
helen 
it was beauclerc
lady blanche then murmured some few
words indistinctly in a very sweet voice but
shewed no indication feeling except as
helen gave one glance she thought she saw a
slight colour like the inside a shell delicately
beautiful but it might be only the
reflection from the crimson silkcurtain near
which she stood it was gone and the picture
put down and in a lively tone from the comtesse
 au revoir and exit a graceful bend
from the silent beauty and the vision vanished
helen stood for some moments fixed to the
somewhere they left her she questioned her
inmost thoughts why was i struck so
much so strangely with that beauty so
painfully it cannot be envy i never was
envious any one though so many i have
seen so much handsomer than myself jealousy
 surely not for there is no reason for
it no possibility danger yet now alas 
when he has so much cause to doubt me perhaps
he might change he seemed so displeased
last night and he has never been here
all the morning 
 helen
she recollected the look and accent madame
de st cymon as she said the words
 au revoir helen did not like the words
or the look she did not like anything about
madame de st cymon something so assured
so impertinent and all that unintelligible
message about those cameos a mere
excuse for making this unseasonable pushing
visit just pushing for the acquaintance
the general will never permit though that
is one comfort but why do i say comfort 
back went the circle her thoughts to the
same point what ran i do the general
will return he will find i have not obeyed him
but what can be done till cecilia returns if
she were but here i could mark we could
settle o cecilia where are you but
thought she had better look at the whole
i will have courage to read these horrible
letters
to prevent all hazard further interruption
she now went into an inner room bolted
the doors and sat down to her dreaded task
and there we leave her
helen 
chapter v
that fortune is not nice in her morality
that she frequently favours those who do not
adhere to truth more than those who do we
have early had occasion to observe but whether
fortune may not be in this as in all the
rest treacherous and capricious whether she
may not by her first smiles and favours lure
her victims on to their cost to their utter
undoing at last remains to be seen
it is title to inquire what has become 
lady cecilia clarendon before we follow
her on her very early morning visit to her
cousins we must take leave to pause one moment
to remark not in the was moralising
by any means but simply as a matter
 history that the first little fib in which
lady cecilia as a customary licence speech
indulged herself the moment she awoke this
 helen
morning though it seemed to answer its purpose
exactly at the time occasioned her ladyship
a good deal superfluous toil and trouble
during the course the day in reply to
the first question her husband had asked orin
evasion that question she had answered
my dear love don't ask me any questions
for i have such a horrid headache that i
really can hardly speaks
now a headache such as she had at that
moment certainly never silenced any woman
slighter could not be scarce enough to swear
by there seemed no great temptation to prevarication
either for the general's question was
not a formidable nature not what the lawyers
call a leading question rather one that led to
nothing it wad only
 had you a pleasant party at lady castlefort's
last night my dear cecilia 
but with that prescience with which some
nicely foresee how the truth seemingly most
innocent may do harm her ladyship foreboded
that if she answered straight forward 
no that might lead to why how or
helen 
wherefore and this might bring out the history
 the strange rude manner in which la
belle jiancte had been received that need not
necessarily have followed but even if it had it
would have done her no harm rather would
have served at once her purpose in the best
manner possible as time will show
her husband unsuspicious man asked no
more questions and only gave her the very
advice she wished him to give that she should
not get up to breakfast that she should rest
as long as she could farther as if to forward
her schemes even without knowing them
he left the house early and her headache conveniently
going off she was dressed with all
despatchcarriage at the door as soon as
husband out sight and away she went
as we have seen without helen's hearing seeing
or suspecting her so well contrived and
executed project
she was now in good spirits the infection
 fear which she had caught perhaps from
the too sensitive helen last night she had
thrown off this morning it was a sunny day
 helen
and the bright sunshine dispelled as ever vfith
her any black notions the night all melancholy
ideas whatsoever she had all the constitutional
hopefulness good animal spirits
bit though no fears remained curiosity was
as strong as ever she was exceedingly eager
to know what had been the cause all these
strange appearances she guessed it must be
some pitiful jealousy lady katrines some
poor spite against helen any thing that
should really give beauclerc uneasiness she
now sincerely believed to be out the question
nonsense only helen and beauclerc's
love tormenting themselves quite nonsense 
and nonsense three times ejaculated quite
settled the matter and assured her in the belief
that there could be nothing serious to be apprehended
in five minutes she should be at the
bottom all things and in half an hour return
triumphant to helen and make her laugh at
her cowardly self the carriage rolled on
lady cecilia's spirits rising as she moved
rapidly onwards so that by the time she arrived
at lady castleforts she was not only in good
but in high spirits
helen 
to her asking not at home never
echoed even at hours undue such as the
present she privileged penetrated accordingly
unquestioned unquestioning the alert
step was let down opened wide was the halldoor
and lightly tripped she up the steps but
the first look into the hall told her that company
was in the house already yes a breakfast
 all were in the breakfast room except
lady castlefort not yet come down above
the footman believed in her boudoir to the
boudoir cecilia went but lady castlefort was
not there and cecilia was surprised to hear the
sound music in the drawingroom lady
castlefort's voice singing while she waited
in the next room for the song to be finished
cecilia turned over the books on the table
richly gilt and beautifully bound except one
in a brown paper parcel which seemed unsuited
to the table yet excited more attention than
all the others because it was directed private
 for lady katherine hawksbyby to be
returned before two o clock what could it
be thought lady cecilia but her attention
was now attracted by the song which lady
vol iii p
 helen
castlefort seemed to be practising the words
were distinctly pronounced uncommonly distinctly
so as to be plainly heard
had we never loved so kindly
had ve never loved so blindly
never met or never parted
we had ne'er been brokenhearted
as cecilia listened she cast her eyes upon a
card which lay on the table lord bertram
and a new light flashed upon her a light
favourable to her present purpose for since the
object was altered with lady castlefort since
it was not beauclerc any longer there would
be no further illwill towards helen lady
castlefort was not the violent vindictive sort
with her there was no longlasting cepit amoureux
she was not that fury a woman scorned
but that blessed spirit a woman believing herself
always admired soft silly sooth not one 
the hard wicked is louisa thought cecilia
and as lady castlefort slowly opening the
door entered tipaid as if she knew some particular
person was in the room cecilia could not
help suspecting that louisa had intended her
song for other ears than those her dear cousin
and that the superb negligence her dress
j
helen 
iras not unstudied but that wellprepared 
wellaccording sentimental air changed in 
instantly on seeing not the person expected
and with a start she exclaimed cecilia clas
tendon 
 louisa castlefort v cried lady cecilia
answering that involuntary start confusion 
with a wellacted start admiration louisa
castlefort si belle si belle so beautifully
dressed 
beautifully dressed nothing extraordinary
 said lady castlefort advancing with a
half embarrassed half nonchalant air one
must make something a toilette de matin
you know when one has people to breakfasts
so elegant so negligent r continued lady
cecilia
there is the point said lady castlefort
 i cannot bear anything that is studied in
costume for dress is really a matter so little
consequence i never bestow a thought upon
it angelique rules my toilette as she pleases
 angelique has the taste an angel fresh
from paris cried lady cecilia
 and now tell me cecilia pursued lady
p 
 helen
castlefort quite in good humour tell me
my dear to what do i owe this pleasure what
makes you so nationale it must be something
very extraordinary
not at all only a little matter curiosity
then from lady castlefort who had hitherto
as if in absence mind stood there
was a slight won't you sit motion
no no i can't sit can't stay said lady
cecilia
a look quickly visible and quickly suppressed
shewed lady castlefort's sense relief
then came immediately greater pressing to
sit down pray do not be in such a hurry
but i am keeping you have you breakfasted

taken coffee in my own room said lady
castlefort
but you have people to breakfast must
not you go down 
no no i shall not go down for this is
katrine's affair as i will explain to you
lady cecilia was quite content without any
explanation and sitting down she drew her
chair close to lady castlefort and said
helen 
now my dear my little matter curiosity

stay my dear first i must tell you about
katrine now confidentially very
lady cecilia ought to have been aware that
when once her dear cousin louisa little
heart opened and she became confidential
very it was always her own domestic grievances
she began to talk and that once the
sluice opened out poured from the deep reservoir
the longexpected minute drops months
and years
you have no idea what a life i lead with
katrine now she is grown blue
 is she said lady cecilia quite indifferent

 deep blue shocking and this is a blue
breakfast and all the people at it are blue
bores and a blue bore is as horace churchill
says one the most mischievous creatures
breathing and he tells me the only way 
hindering them from doing mischief is by
ringing them but first you must get rings
now in this case for katrine not a ring to
be had for love or money so there is no hope
for me
 helen
c
no hope for me thought lady cecilia
throwing herself back in her chair submissive
but not resigned
if it had but pleased heaven continued
lady castlefort in its mercy to have sent
katrine a husband any kind what a blessing
it would have been if she could but
have been married to anybody now anybody

 anybody is infinitely obliged to you said
cecilia but since that is out the question
let us say no more about it no use
no use that is the very thing which i
complain the very thing which must ever
ever make me miserable
well well my dear cried lady cecilia
no longer capable patience do not be
miserable any more just now never mind
katrine just now
never mind her easy for you to say
cecilia who do not live with katrine hawksbyby
and do not know what it is to have such a
plague a sister watching one watching
every turn every look one gives worse than a
jealous husband can i say more 
helen 
no cried cecilia therefore say no
more about it i understand it all perfectly
and i pity you from the bottom my heart 
so now my dear louisa 
i tell you my dear cecilia pursued lady
castlefort continuing her own thoughts i
tell you katrine is envious me envy has
been her fault from a child envy poor me 
envy in the erst place whatever good
looks it pleased providence to give me a
glance at the glass and now katrine
envies me for being lady castlefort heaven
knows now cecilia and you know she need
not envy me so when she looks at lord castlefort
 that is what she sometimes says herself
which you know is very wrong her to say to
the unnecessary too when she knows i had
no more hand in my marriage 
than heart cecilia could not forbear
saying
than heart readily responded lady
castlefort never was a truer word said
never was there a more complete sacrifice than
my mother made me you know cecilia a
poor young innocent helpless sacrifice if ever
there was one upon earth
 helen
to a coronet said lady cecilia
absolutely dragged to the altar continued
lady castlefort
 in mechlin lace that was some comfort
said cecilia laughing and she laughed on in
hope cutting short this sad chapter sacrifices
but lady castlefort did not understand
raillery upon this too tender point i don't
know what you mean by mechlin laces cried
she pettishly is this your friendship forme
cecilia 
cecilia justly in fear losing the reward 
all her large layout flattery fell to protesting
the tenderest sympathy but only now
it was all over why make her heart bleed
about what could not be helped 
cannot be helped oh there is the very
thing i must ever ever mourn
the embroidered cambric handkerchief was
taken out the bag no tears indeed came
but there were sobs and cecilia not knowing
how far it might go apprehending that her
ladyship meditated hysterics seized a smellingbottle
threw out the stopper and presented
it close under the nostrils the good seu
helen 
poignant dangleterrey which felicie always
acknowledged the unrivalled potency did
their business effectually back went the
heady with an exclamation that's enough 
oh oh too much too much cecilia 
are you better my dear inquired cecilia
 but indeed you must not give way to
low spirits indeed you must not so now to
change the conversation louisa 
not so fast lady cecilia not yet and
now louisa went on with a medical maundering
as to low spirits my dear cecilia i must
say i agree with sir sib pennyfeather who
tell me it is not mere common low spirits but
really all mind too much mind mind preying
upon my nerves oh i i knew it myself at
first he thought it was rather constitutional
poor dear sir sib he is very clever sir sib 
and i convinced him he was wrong and so
we agreed that it was all upon my mind all
all 
at that instant a green parrot who had been
half asleep in the comer awoke on lady
castleforts pronouncing in an elevated tone
all all and conceiving himself in some
f
 helen
way called upon answered poll poll bit
o sugar poll 
no small difficulty had lady cecilia at that
moment in keeping her risible muscles in order 
but she did for helenass sake and she was rewarded
for after lady castlefort had all unconscious
 ridicule fed poll from her amber
bonbonniere and sighed out once more mind 
too much mind she turned to cecilia and
said but my dear you wanted something 
you had something to ask me
at once and as fast as she could speak
lady cecilia poured out her business about
helen stanley she told the illbred manner
in which helen had been received last
night inquired why the words process sposi
and belle fiancee were so oddly repeated as if
they had been watchwords and asked what was
meant by all those strange whisperings in the
sanctum sanatorium
katrine's set observed lady castlefort
coolly just like them just like her 
 i should not care about it in the least
said lady cecilia if it were only katrine's
illnatures or their illbreeding illbreeding
helen 
always recoils on the illbred and does nobody
else any harm but i should be glad to be
quite clear that there is nothing more at the
bottom
lady casdefort made no reply but took up
a bunch seals and looked at each them
one after another
lady cecilia more afraid now than she had
yet jbeenthat there was something at the bottom
still bravely went on what is it if
you know tell me at once
nay ask katrine said lady castlefort
no i ask you i would rather ask you
for you are goodnatured louisa so tell
me
 but i dare say it is only slanders said the
goodnatured louisa
slander repeated lady cecilia slander
did you say 
yes what is there to surprise you so
much in that word did you never hear such
a thing i am sure i hear too much it 
katrine lives and breathes and fattens upon it 
as churchill says she eats slander drinks
slander sleeps upon slander
 helen
 but tell me what helen that is all i
want to hear cried lady cecilia slander 
 helen stanley what is it that katrine
says about poor helen what spite what
vengeance can she have against her tell me
tell me
 if you wgild ask one question at a time
i might be able to answer you said lady
castlefort do not hurry me so you fidget
my nerves first as to the spite you know
yourself that katrine from the beginning
never could endure helen stanley for my part
i always rather liked her than otherwise and
shall defend her to the last
 defend her r
 but katrine was always jealous her
and lately worse than ever for getting into her
place as she says with you that made her
hate her all the more
let her hate on that will never make me
love helen the less
so i told her and besides miss stanley
is going to be married
to be sure well 
and katrine naturally hates everybody
helen 
that is going to be married if you were to
see the state she is in always reading the
announcements marriages in high life
churchill i do believe had miss stanley
intended match put into every paper continually
on purpose for the pleasure plaguing
katrine and if you could have seen her long
face when she saw it announced in the court
gazette good authority you know really it
was pitiable
i don't care i don't care about that oh
pray go on to the facts about helen
well but the fact is as i tell you you
wanted to know what sufficient cause for vengeance
and am not i telling you if you
would not get into such a state excitement
 as sir sib says excitements should
be avoided la my dear continued lady
castlefort looking up at her with unfeigned
astonishment what agitation why if it
were a matter that concerned yourself 
 it concerns my friend and that is the
same thing
 so one says but you look really such a
colour
 helen
 no matter what colour i look cried cecilia
 go on
 do you never read the papers said lady
castlefort
sometimes said lady cecilia but i
have not looked at a paper these three days 
was there any thing particular p tell me
 my dear tell you as if i could remember
by heart all the scandalous paragraphs i
read she looked round the room and not
seeing the papers said i do not know what
has become those papers but you can find
them when you go home
she mentioned the names two papers
noted for being personal scandalous and
scurrilous
are those the papers you mean cried
lady cecilia the general never lets them
into the house
that is a pity that s hard upon you
for then you never are as you see au courant
du jour and all your friends might be abused
to death without your knowing it if some
kind person did not tell you
 do tell me then the substance i don't
want the words
j
helen ill
 but the words are all somehow it is
nothing without the words
in her now excited state communicativeness
lady castlefort rose and looked all about
the room for the papers saying they were
here they were there all yesterday katrine had
them shewing them to lady bashan in the
morning and to au her blue set afterwards 
lord knows what she has done with them so
tiresome looking for things how i hate it
she rang the bell and inquired from the
footman if he knew what had become the
papers course he did not know could not
imagine servants never know nor can imagine
what have become newspapers but he would
inquire
while he went to inquire lady castlefort
sank down again into her bertie and again
fell into admiration ceciliass state impatience

 how curious you are now i am never
really curious about anything that does not
come home to myself i have so little interest
about other people
this was said in all the simplicity selfishly
helen
ness not from candour but from mere absence
 shame and utter ignorance what others
think what others feel which always characterises
and often betrays the selfish even
where the head is best capable supplying the
deficiencies the heart but louisa castlefort
had no head to hide her want heart while
cecilia who had both head and heart looked
down upon her cousin with surprise pity and
contempt quick succeeding each other in a
sort parenthesis feeling as she moved her
eyes for a moment from the door on which
they had been fixed and to which they recurred
while she stood waiting for the appearance
 those newspapers
the footmen entered with them in mr
tantrums room they were my lady
lady cecilia did not hear a word that was
said nor did she see that the servant laid a note
on the table it was well that louisa had
that note to read and to answer while cecilia
looked at the paragraphs in these papers else
her start must have been seen her exclamation
must have been heard it must have been
marked that the whole character her emo
helen lis
tion changed from generous sympathy with her
friend to agony fear for herself
the instant she cast her eyes on that muchread
paper she saw the name colonel
d'aubigny all the rest swam before her eyes
lady castlefort without looking up from her
writing asked what day the month
cecilia could not answer but recalled to herself
by the sound the voice she now tried to read
she scarcely read the words but some way
took the sense into her mind at a glance
 helen
chapter vi
the first these paragraphs caught the eye
by its title in capital letters
 la belle fiancee
though quite unknown in the london
world this young lady cannot fail to excite
some curiosity among our fashionables as the
successful rival one whom the greatest painter
 the age has pronounced to be the fairest
 the fair the lady b f this
new helen is we understand a respectable
family niece to a late dean distinguished for
piety much and viri more it was reported
that the niece was a great heiress but after the
proposal had been made it was discovered that
birth had made away with every shilling 
her fortune this made no difference in the
eyes her inamorato who is as rich as he is
helen 
generous and who saw with the eyes a
youth age tomorrow his guardian a
wary general demurred but nursery tactics
prevailed the youiig lady though she had
never been out bore the victory from him 
many campaigns the day for the marriage 
was fixed as announced by us but weare
condemned to state that a postponement 
this marriage for mysterious reasons has taken
place delicacy forbids us to say more at
present
delicacy however did not prevent their
saying in the next paper in a paragraph headed
 mystery solved
 we understand that in the course a few
days will appear the memoirs the late colonel
d y or reminiscences a roue
well known in the fashionable world
 this little volume bids fair to engross the
attention the higher circles as it contains
besides innumerable curious personal and
secret anecdotes the original loveletters a
certain belle fiancee now residing with a noble
family in grosvenor square
 helen
lady cecilia saw at once the whole dreadful
danger her own letters to colonel dau
bigny they must be how could they have
got them they would be seen by her husband
 published to the whole world if the
general found out they were her's he would
cast her off for ever if they were believed to
be helen's helen was undone sacrificed to
her folly her cowardice oh if i had but
told clarendon he would have stopped this
dreadful dreadful publication
and what falsehoods it might contain she
did not even dare to think all was remorse
terror confusion fixed to the spot like one
stupefied she stood
lady castlefort did not see it she had
been completely engrossed with what she had
been writing she was now looking for her most
sentimental seal and not till she had pressed
that seal down and examined the impression
did she look up or notice cecilia then struck
indeed with a sense something unusual
my dear said she you have no idea
how odd you look so strange cecilia quite
sbahie r giving two pulls to the bell as she
helen 
i
spoke and her eyes on the door impatient for
the servant she added after all cecilia
helen stanley is no relation even only a
friend take this note to the footman who
answered the bell and the moment he left
the room continuing in the same tone to lady
cecilia she said you will have to give her
up at last that's all so you had better make
your mind up to it
when lady cecilia tried to speak she felt
as if her tongue cleaved to the roof her
mouth and when she did articulate it was ina
sort hoarse sound is the pub
wished she held the paper before lady
castlefort's eyes and pointed to the name she
could not utter
 d'aubigny's is it published do you
mean said lady castlefort absolutely
published i cannot say but it is all in print
i know i do not understand about publishing
there's something about presentation
copies i know katrine was wild to have one
before anybody else so she is to have the first
copy i know and i believe is to have it
this very morning for the people at this breaks
helen
fast it is to be the bonne bouche the
business
 what has katrine to do with it oh
tell me quick 
 dear me cecilia what a fuss you are in 
you make me quite nervous to look at you
you had better go down to the breakfastroom
and you will hear all about it from the fountainhead

has katrine the or not cried lady
cecilia
 bless me i will inquire my dear if you
will not look so dreadful she rang and
coolly asked did that man that bookseller
stone send any parcel or this morning
do you know for lady katrine 
 yes my lady antrum had a parcel
for lady katrine it is on the table i believe
very well the man left the room
lady cecilia darted on the brown paper parcel
she had seen directed to lady katrine and
seized it before the amazed louisa could prevent
her stop stop cried she springing
forward stop cecilia katrine will never
forgive me 
helen 
but lady cecilia seizing a penknife cut
the first knot
 oh cecilia i am undone if katrine comes
in i make haste make haste i can only let
you have a peep or two we must do it up
again as well as ever continued lady castlefort
while lady cecilia fast as possible
went on cut cut cutting the packthread to
bits and she tore off the brown paper cover
then one silver paper that protected the silk
binding
lady castlefort took up the outer cover and
read to be returned before two o'clock 
 what can that mean then it is only lent 
not her own katrine will not understand this
will be outrageously disappointed i m
sure i don't care but here is a note from
stone however which may explain it she
opened and read 
 stone's respects existing circumstances
make it necessary her ladyship's copy should
be returned will be called for at two o'clock
 cecilia cecilia make haste but katrine
does not know yet still she may come
up lady castlefort rang and inquired
 helen
r
 have they done breakfast 
breakfast is over ray lady said the servant
who answered the bell but antrum
thinks the gentlemen and ladies will not be up
immediately on account one the ladies
being performing a poem
very well very good added her ladyship
as the man left the room then cecilia
you will have time enough for when once
they begin performing as sylvester calls it
there is no it
 oh heavens cried cecilia as she turned
over the pages oh heavens what is here 
such absolute falsehood shocking shocking
 she exclaimed as she looked on terrified
at what she saw absolutely false a
forgery
whereabouts are you said lady castlefort
approaching to read along with her
 oh do not read it cried cecilia and she
hastily closed the 
what signifies shutting the my dear
said louisa as if you could shut people's
eyes i know what it is i have read it
read it 
helen 
 read it i really can read though it
seems to astonish you
 but it is not published 
one can read in manuscript
and did you see the manuscript 
i had a glimpse yes i know more
than katrine thinks i know
 o tell me louisa tell me all cried
cecilia
i will but you must never tell that i told
it to you 
speak speak cried cecilia
it is a long story said lady castlefort
 make it short then o tell me quick
louisa 
there is a literary lessons des cartes said
lady castlefort a little vain knowing a literary
dessous des cartes churchill being at
the head every thing that sort you know
the bookseller brought him the manuscript
which sir thomas d'aubigny had offered him
and wanted to know whether it would do or
not mr churchill answer was that it would
never do without more pepper and salt meaning
gossip and scandal and all that but
vol iii g
 helen
you are reading on gedlia not listening tome


cc
i am listening indeed
then never tell how i cameo know everything
katrine's maid has a lover who is as
she phrases it one the gentlemen connected
with the press now my angelique who
cannot endure katrines maid tells me that
this man is only a wondermakers a halfcrown
paragraph writer so through angelique
and indeed from another person she
stopped and then went on through
angelique it all came up to me
all what cried cecilia go on go onto
the facts
 i will if you will not hurry me so the
letters were not in miss stanley's handwriting
 no i am sure that's said cecilia
 copies were all that they pretended to be 
so they may be forgeries after all you sees
 but how did katrine or mr churchill
come by the copies 
 i have a notion but this i am not
quite surei have a notion from something
helen s
i was tdd by in short i suspect that carlos
lady davenant's page somehow got at them
and gave them or had them given to the
man who was to publish the lady
katrine and churchill laid their heads together
here in this very sanctum sanatorium
they thought i knew nothing but i knew
everything i do not believe horace had anything
to do with it except saying that the
loveletters would be just the thing for the
public if they were bad enough i remember
too that it was he who added the second title
reminiscences a bou and said something
about alliteration artful aid and now
concluded lady castlefort it is coming to
the grand catastrophe as katrine calls it
she has already told the story and today she
was to give all her set what she calls ocular
demonstration cecilia now quick finish
they will he here this instant give me the
 let me do it up this minutes
 jto no let me put it up cried lady
celia keeping possession the and the
brown paper i am a famous hand at doing
helen
up a parcel as famous as any bond street
showman your hands are not made for such
work
anybody but lady castlefort would have
discerned that lady cecilia had some further
design and she was herself afraid it would be
perceived but taking courage from seeing
what a fool she had to ded with lady cecilia
went on more boldly louisa i must have
more packthread this is all cut to bits
 i will ring and ask for some
 no no do not ring for the footman be
might observe that we had opened the parcel
cannot you get a string without ringing
look in that baskets
 none there i knows said lady castlefort
without stirring
in your own room then angelique has

some

how do you know p
 i know never mind how oo and she
will give you packthread i must have it be 
fore katrine comes up so go louisa go
 go in the imperative mood operated
and she went she did not know why
helen 
that instant lady cecilia drew the out
 the halffolded paper and quick quick
tore out page after page every page those
letters that concerned herself or helen and
into the fire thrust them and as they blazed
held them down bravely had the boldness to
wait till all was black all the while she trembled
but stood it and they were burnt and the
 in its brown paper cover was left on the
table and she down stairs before lady castlefortes
dressingroom door opened and she crossed
the hall without meeting a soul except the man
in waiting there the breakfastroom was at
the back the house looking into the gardens
and her carriage at the frontdoor had never
been seen by lady katrine or any her blue
set she cleared out the house into her carriage
 and off to the park said she
she was off but just in time the whole
tribe came out the breakfastroom before she
had turned the comer the street she threw
herself back in the carriage and took breath
congratulating herself upon this hairbreadth
scape for this hour this minute she had
escaped she was reprieved 
 helen
and now what was next to be done this
was but a momentary reprieve another copy
would be had no not till tomorrow though
the sound the words that had been read
from the booksellers note by lady castlefort
though scarcely noticed at the time recurred to
her now and there was hope something might
today be done to prevent the publication it
might still be kept for ever from her husbands
and from beauclerk knowledge one stratagem
had succeeded others might
she took a drive round the park to compose
the excessive flurry her spirits letting
down all the glasses she had the fresh air
blowing upon her and ere she was half round
she was able to think what yet remained todo
money oh any money she could
command she would give to prevent this publication
she was not known to the bookseller
 no matter money is money from
whatever hand she would trust the matter
to no one but herself and she would go immediately
 not a moment to be lost
to stone's the bookseller's
helen 
arrived do not give my name only say
a lady wants to speak to mr stone's
the people at mr stones did qot know the
livery or the carriage but such a carriage and
such a lady commanded the deference the
showman
 please to walk in madam and by the
time she had walked in the man changed
madam into your ladyship mr stone will
be with your ladyship in a moment only in
the warehouse if your ladyship will please to
walk up into the back drawingroom there's
a fire
the maid followed to blow it and while
the bellows wheezed and the fire did not bum
lady cecilia looked out the window in
eag expectation seeing mr stone returning
from the warehouse with all due celerity
no mr stone however appeared but there
was a good fire in the middle the courtyard
as she observed to the maid who was plying
the wheezing bellows and who answered
that they had had a great fire there this hour
past burning papers and at that mos

 helen
ment a man came out with his arms full 
a huge pile sheets a lady cecilia saw
it was thrown on the fire then came out
and stood beside the fire could she be mistaken
 impossible it was like a dream 
the general 
cecilia's first thought was to run away before
she should be seen but the next moment that
thought was abandoned for the time to execute
it was now past the messenger sent across
the yard had announced that a lady in the back
drawingroom wanted mr stone eyes had
looked up the general had seen and recognised
her and all she could now do was to
recognise him in return which she did as
eagerly and gracefully as possible
the general came up to her directly not a
little astonished that she whom he fancied at
home in her bed incapacitated by a headache
that had prevented her from speaking to him
should be here so far out her usual haunts
and as it seemed out her element what
can bring you here my dear cecilia 
the same purpose which if i rightly spell
brought you here my dear general and her
helen 
eye intelligently glanced at the burning papers
in the yard
do you know then cecilia what those
papers are how did you know 
lady cecilia told her history keeping as
strictly to facts as the natures the case admitted
her headache course she had
found much better for the sleep she had taken
she had set op she told him as soon as
she was able for lady castleforts to inquire
into the meaning the strange whispers the
preceding night then she told the scandalous
paragraphs she had seen how she had
looked over the and how successfully
she had torn out and destroyed the whole
chapter and then how hoping to be able to
prevent the publication she had driven directly
to mr stone's
her husband with confiding admiring eyes
looked at her and listened to her and thought
all she said so natural so kind that he could
not but love her the more for her zeal friendship
though he blamed her for interfering
in defiance his caution had you consulted
me or listened to me my dear cecilia
g
 helen
this morning i could have saved you all this
trouble i should have told you that i would
settle with stone and stop the publication as
i have done
 but that copy which had been sent to
lady katrine surely i did some good thereby
burning those pages for if once it had got
among her set it would have spread like wildfire
you know clarendon
he acknowledged this and said smiling 
be satisfied with yourself my love i acknowledge
that you made there a capital coup
de mains
just then in came mr stone with an account
in his hand which the general stepped
forward to receive and after one glance at the
amount he took up a pen wrote and signed
his name to a cheque on his banker mr
stone received it bowed obsequiously and
assured the general that every copy the
offensive chapter had been withdrawn from the
 and burnt that copy excepted which
you have yourself general and that which
was sent to lady katrine hawksbyby which
we expect in every minute and it shall be sent
helen 
to grosvenor square immediately i will bring
it myself to prevent all dangers
the general who knew there was no danger
there smiled at cecilia and told the bookseller
that he need take no further trouble
about lady weariness copy the man bowed
and lodging again at the amount the cheque
retired well satisfied
 you come home with me my dear clarendon
do not you said lady cecilia
they drove off on their way the general
said it is always difficult to decide whether
to contradict or to let such publications take
their course but in the present case to stop
the scandal instantly and completely was the
only thing to be done there are cases 
honour when women are concerned where law
is too slow it must not be remedy it must be
prevention if the finger scorn dares to
point it must be cut off after a pause 
grave thought he added upon the manner
in which helen now acts will depend her happiness
 her character her whole future life
lady cecilia summoned all her power to
prevent her from betraying herself the danger
 helen
was great for she could not command her fears
so completely as to hide the look alarm with
which she listened to the general but in his
eyes her agitation appeared no more than was
natural for her to feel about her friend
my love continued he if helen is
worthy your affection she will shew it now
her only resource is in perfect truth tell her
so cecilia impress it upon her mind would
to heaven i had been able to convince her 
this at first speak to her strongly cecilia 
as you love her impress upon her that my
esteem beauclerk love the happiness her
life depend upon her truth as he repeated
these words the carriage stopped at their own
door
helen 
chapter vii
wb left helen in the back drawingroom
the door bolted and beginning to read her
dreaded task the paragraphs in the newspapers
we have seen were sufficiently painful
but when she came to the itself to the
letters she was in consternation greater even
than what she had felt in the generals presence
under the immediate urgency his eye and
voice her conviction was that in each 
these letters there were some passages some
expressions which certainly were gecilias but
mixed with others which as certainly were
not hers the internal evidence appeared to
her irresistibly strong and even in those
passages which she knew to be gecilias writings
it too plainly appeared that however
playfully however delicately expressed there
was more real attachment for colonel dau
 helen
bigny than cecilia had ever allowed helen to
believe and she felt that cecilia must shrink
from general clarendons seeing these as her
letters after she had herself assured him that
he was her first love the falsehood was here
so indubitable so proved that helen herself
trembled at the thought ceciliass acknowledging
the plain facts to her husband
the time for it was past now that they were
in print published perhaps how must he feel 
if even candid confession were made to him
and made for the best motives it would to
him appear only forced by necessity forced
as he would say to himself because her friend
would not submit to be sacrificed
such were helen's thoughts on reading the
two or three first letters but as she went on
her alarm increased to horror she saw things
which she felt certain cecilia could never have
written yet truth and falsehood were so mixed
up in every paragraph circumstances which
she herself had witnessed so misrepresented
that it was all to her inextricable confusion
the passages which were to be marked could
not now depend upon her opinion her belief
helen 
they must rest upon gecilias integrity and
could she depend upon it the impatience
which she had felt for lady ceciliass return
now faded away and merged in the more painful
thought that when she did come the suspense
would not the doubts would never
be satisfied
she lay down upon the sofa and tried to
rest kept herself perfectly still and resolved
to think no more and as far as the power 
the mind over itself can stay the everrising
thoughts she controlled hers and waited with
a sort forced desperate composure for the
event
suddenly she heard that knock that ring
which she knew announced lady ceciuas return
but not cecilia alone she heard the
general also coming up stairs but cecilia first
who did not stop for more than an instant
at the drawingroom door she looked in as
helen guessed and seeing that no one was
there ran very quickly up the next flight 
stairs next came the general on hearing
his step helen's anxiety became so intense
that she could not at the moment he came near
 helen
catch the sound or distinguish which way he
went strained beyond its power the faculty
 hearing seemed suddenly to fail all was
confusion an indistinct buzz sounds the
next moment however recovering she plainly
heard his step in the front drawingroom and
she knew that he twice walked up and down the
whole length the room as if in deep thought
each time as he approached the foldingdoors
she was breathless at last he stopped his
hand was on the lock she recollected that the
door was bolted and as he turned the handle
she in a powerless voice called to tell him but
not hearing her he tried again and as the door
shook she again tried to speak but could not
still she heard though she could not articulate
she heard him say
miss stanley are you there can i see
you
but the words the voice seemed to come
from afar sounded dull and strange she
tried to rise from her seat found a difficulty
made an export stood up she summoned
resolution struggled hurried across the room
drew back the bolt threw open the door 
fielen 
and that was all she could do in that sort
strength and consciousness failedshe fell forward
and fainted at the general's feet
he raised her up and laid her on a sofa in
the inner room he rang for her maid and
went opstairs to prevent cecilia's being alarmed
he took the matter coolly he had seen
many fainting young ladies he did not like them
his own cecilia excepted in his mind always
excepted from every unfavourable suspicion regarding
the sex helen on the contrary was at
present subject to them all and under the cloud
 distrust he saw in a bad light everything
that occurred the same appearances which in
his wife he would have attributed to the sensibility
 true feeling he interpreted in helen
as the consciousness falsehood the proof 
cowardly duplicity he went back at once to
his original prejudice against her when as he
first thought she had been forced upon him
in preference to his own sister he had been
afterwards convinced that she had been perfectly
free from all doubledealing yet now he
slid back again as people his character often
do to their first opinion
 helbtt
 i thought so at first and i find as i usually
do that my first thought was right
what had been but an adverse feeling was
now considered as a prescient judgment and
he did not go upstairs the quicker for these
thoughts but calmly and coolly when he
reached lady cecilia's dressingroom knocked
at the door and with all the precautions necessary
to prevent her from being alarmed told
her what had happened you had better
not go down my dear cecilia i beg you will
not miss stanley has her own maid ill the
assistance that can be wanted my dedit is
not fit for you i desire you will not go down
but lady cecilia would not listen could not
be detained she escaped from her husband
and ran down to helen excessively alarmed
she was and well she might be knowing herself
to be the cause and not certain in any way
how it might 
she found helen ei little recovered but still
pale as white marble and when lady cecilia
took her hand it was still quite cold she
came to herself but very slowly never in her
life having fainted before for some minutes
helen s
she did cot recover perfect consciousness
or clear recollection she saw figures persons
moving about her she felt them as if
too near and wished them away wanted air
but could not say what she wished she would
have moved but her limbs would not obey her
will at last when she had with efibrt half
raised her head it sunk back again before she
could distinguish all the persons in the room
the shock cold water on her forehead revived
her then coming clearly to power 
perception she saw cecilia bending over her
but still she could not speak and yet she
understood distinctly saw the affectionate
anxiety too in her little maid besets countenance
 she felt that she loved rose and that
she could not endure felicie who had now
come in and was making exclamations and
advising various remedies all which when
offered helen declined it was not merely
that felicies talking and tone voice and
superabundant action were too much for her 
but that helen had at this moment a sort 
intuitive perception insincerity and exaggeration
in that dreamy state hovering
 helen
between life and death in which people are oncoming
out a swoon it seems as if there was
need for a firm hold reality the senses and
the understanding join in the struggle and
become most acute in their perception what
is natural or what is unnatural true or false

in the expressions and feelings the bystanders

lady cecilia understood her look and dismissed
felicie with all her smellingbottles
rose though not ordered away judiciously
retired as soon as she saw that her services
were no further use and that there was
something upon her young lady's mind for
which hartshorn and sal volatile could be 
no avail
cecilia would have kissed her forehead but
helen made a slight withdrawing motion and
turned away her face the next instant however
she looked up an taking ceciliass hand
pressed it kindly and said
you are more to be pitied than i am sit
down sit down beside me my poor cecilia 
how you tremble and yet jou do not know
what is coming upon you
helen 
yes yes i do i do cried lady cecilia
and she eagerly told helen all that had passed
ending with the assurance that the publication
had been completely stopped by her dear clarendon
 that the whole chapter containing the
letters had been destroyed that not a single
copy had got abroad the only one in existence
is thisbe said she taking it up as she spoke
and she made a movement as if going to tear
out the leaves but helen checked her hand
 that must not be the general desired 
and almost breathless yet distinctly she
repeated what the general had said that he
might be called upon to prove which parts
were forged and which true and that she had
promised to mark the passages
 so now cecilia here is a pencil and mark
vhat is and what is not yours
lady cecilia instantly took the pencil and
in great agitation obeyed
oh my dear helen some these the
oeneral could not think yoiirs very wicked
these people have been so the general said 
he was sure he knew all could not be yours
 finish my dear cecilia interrupted
s helen
helen finish what you have to do and in
this last trial give me this one proof your
sincerity be careful in what you are now
doing mark truly oh cecilia every word
you recollect as your conscience tells you
will you cecilia this is all i ask as i am to
answer for it will you 
most fervently she protested she would she
had lio difficulty in recollecting in distinguishing
her own and at first she marked truly
and was glad to separate what was at worst
only foolish girlish nonsense from things which
had been interpolated to make out the romance 
things which never could have come from her
mind
there is some comfort in having our own
faults overshadowed outdone by the greater
faults others and here it was flagrant
wickedness in the editor and only weakness
and imprudence in the writer the real
letters lady cecilia continually solaced her
conscience by pointing out to helen fs she
went on the ibuy literally the folly the deception
she had practised on her husband ibid
her exclamations against herself we isp vehe
helen 
ment that helen would not add to her pain by
a single reproach since she had decided that
the time was past for urging her confession to
the general she now only said
 look to the future cecilia the past we
cannot recal this will be a lesson you can
njbver forget
oh never never can i forget it you
have saved me helens
tears and protestations followed these words
and at the moment they were all sincere and
yet can it be believed p even in this last trial
when it came to this last proof lady cecilia
was not perfectly true she purposely avoided
putting her mark acknowledgment to any 
those expressions which most clearly proved
her love forcolond daubigny for she still
said to herself that the time might come though
at present it could not be when she might
make a confession to her husband in his joy
at the birth son she thought she might
venture she still looked forward to doing justice
to her friend at some future period and to
make this easier to make this possible as she
said to herself she must now leave out certain
 helen
expressions which might if acknowledged remain
for ever fixed in clarendon's mind and
for which she could never be forgiven
helen when she looked over the pages observed
among the unmarked passages some 
those expressions which she had thought were
ceciliass but she concluded she was mistaken 
i
she could not believe that her friend could at
such a moment deceive her and she was even
ashamed having doubted her sincerity and
her words look and manner now gave assurance
 perfect unquestioning confidence
this delicacy in helen struck lady cecilia
to the quick ever apt to b more touched by
her refined feelings than by any strong appeal
to her reason or her principles she was now
shocked by the contrast between her own paltering
meanness and her friends confiding generosity
as this thought crossed her mind she
stretched out her hand again for the took
up the pencil and was going to mark the
truth but the impulse past cowardice prevailed
and cowardice whispered helen is
looking at me helen sees at this moment what
i am doing and after having marked them as
j
helen 
not mine how can i now acknowledge them 
it is too late it is impossible
 i have done as you desired continued
she helen to the best my ability i have
marked all this but what can it signify now
my dear except 
helen interrupted her take the to
the general this moment will you and tell him
that all the passages are marked as he desired 
stay i had better write
she wrote upon a slip paper a message
to the same expect having well considered the
words by which she might without further
step in deception save her friend and take
upon herself the whole blame the whole hazardous
responsibility
when cecilia gave the marked to
general clarendon he said as he took it i
am glad she has done this though it is unnecessary
now as i was going to tell her if she
had not fainted unnecessary because i have
now in my possession the actual copies the
original letters i found them here on my return
that good little poetess found them forme
at the printer's but she could not discovol
iii h
 helen
ver i have not yet been able to trace where
they came from or by whom they were copied
o let me see them cried lady cecilia
not yet my love said he you would
know nothing more by seeing them they are ina
feigned hand evidently 
but interrupted cecilia you cannot
want the now when you have the letters
themselves f and she attempted to draw it from
his hand for she instantly perceived the danger
 the discrepancies between her marks and th
letters being detected she made a stronger
effort to withdraw the but he held it
fast
leave it with me now my dear i want
it it will settle my opinion as to helen's
truth
slowly and absolutely sickened with apprehension
lady cecilia withdrew when she
returned to helen and found how pale she was
and how exhausted she seemed she entreated
her to lie down again and try to rest
yes i believe i had better rest before i
see granville said helen where can he
have been all day 
helen 
 with some friend bis i suppose said
cecilia and she insisted on helenass saying
no more and keeping herself perfectly quiet
she farther suggested that she had better not
appear at dinner
it will be only a family party some the
general's relations miss clarendon is to be
here and she is one you know trying to the
spirits and she is not likely to be in her mos
suave humour this evening as she has been
under a course the toothache and has been
all day at the dentists
helen readily consented to remain in her
own room though she had not so great a
dread miss clarendon as lady cecilia
seemed to feel lady cecilia was indeed in
the greatest terror lest miss clarendon should
have heard some these reports about helen
and beauclerc and would in her blunt way
ask directly what they meant and go on with
some her pointblank questions which ce
cilia feared might be found unanswerable
however as miss clarendon had only just
come to town from wales and come only
about her teeth she hoped that no reports
h 
 helen
could have reached her and cecilia trusted
much to her own address and presence mind
in moments danger in turning the converse
nation the way it should go
but things were now come to a point where
none the little skilful interruptions or lucky
hits by which she had so frequently profited
avail her farther than to delay what
inst be passion and character pursue their
course unalterably unimpeded by small external
circumstances interrupted they may be
in their progress but as the stream opposed
bears against the obstacle sweeps it away or
foams and passes by
before lady cecilias toilette was finished
her husband was in her dressingroom came in
without knocking a circumstance so unusual
with him that mademoiselle felicie's eyes
opened to their utmost orbit and without
waiting for word or look she vanished leaving
the bracelet half clasped on her lady's arm
 cecilia said the general
he spoke in so stern a tone that she trembled
from head to foot her last falsehood about the
letters all her falsehoods all her concealments
helen 
were she thought discovered unable to support
herself she sank into bis arm he seated her
and went on in a cool inexorable tone ce
ciha i ara determined not to sanction by any
token my public approbation this marriage
which i no longer in my private conscience
desire or approve i will not be the person to
give miss stanley to my wards
lady cecilia almost screamed her selfish
fears forgotten she felt only terror for her
friend she exclaimed clarendon will you
break off the marriage oh helen what will
become her clarendon what can you
mean 
 i mean that i have compared the passages
that helen marked in the with those
copies the letters which were given to the
bookseller before the interpolations were made
the letters as miss stanley wrote them the
passages in the letters and the passages marked
in the do not agrees
 oh but she might have forgotten it might
be accident cried cecilia overwhelmed with
confusion
no cecilia pursued the oeneral in a
 helen
tone which made her heart die within her
 no cecilia it is not accident it is design
i perceive that every strong expression every
word in short which could shew her attachment
to that man has been purposely marked
as not her own and the letters themselves
prove that they were her own the truth is
not in her
in an agitation which prevented all power 
thought cecilia exclaimed she mistook 
she mistook i could not i am sure recollect 
she asked me if i remembered any 
 she consulted you then 
she asked my advice told me that 
i particularly requested her interrupted
the general not to ask your advice i desired
her not to speak to you on the subject 
not to consult you deceit doubledealing
in every thing she does i find
no no it is my fault everything i say
and do is wrong cried lady cecilia i
recollect now it was just after her fainting
when i brought the and when she took
it to mark she really was lot able it was
not that she consulted me but i forced my
helen 
counsel upon her i looked over the letters and
said what i thought if anybody is wrong it is
i clarendon oh do not visit my sins upon
helen so cruelly do not make me the cause
 her ruin innocent creature i assure you
if you do this i never could forgive myself
the general looked at her in silence she
did not dare to meet his eyes desperately
anxious as she was to judge by his countenance
what was passing within he clasped for her
that bracelet which her trembling hands were
in vain attempting to close
poor thing how its heart beats said her
husband pressing her to him as he sat down
beside her cecilia thought she might venture
to speak you know my dear clarendon i
never oppose interfere with any determination
 yours when once it is fixed 
this is fixed interrupted the general
but after all you have done for her this
very day for which i am sure she i am sure
i thank you from my soul would you now
undo it all 
she is saved from public shame said the
general from private contempt i cannot
 helen
save her who can save those who have not
truth but my determination is fixed it is
useless to waste words on the subject esther
is come i must go to her and now cecilia
i conjure you when you see beauclerc i
have not seen him all day i do not know
where he has been i conjure you i command
you not to interfere between him and helen
but you would not have me give her up 
i should be the basest human beings
i do not know what you mean cecilia 
you have done for her all that an honourable
friend could do
i am not an honourable friends was cecilia's
bitter consciousness as she pressed her
hand upon her heart which throbbed violently
with contending fears
you have done all that an honourable
friend could do more must not be done
continued the general and now recollect
cecilia that you are my wife a well as miss
stanley's friend and as he said these words
he left the room
helen 
chapter viii
that knowing french minister louis
whose power is said to have been maintained
by his surpassing skill in collecting and spreading
secret and swift intelligence had in his pay
various classes unsuspected agents 
feofager ugge r nn
liners hairdressers and barbers dentists he
would have added had he lived to our times 
and not all paris could have furnished him
with a person better suited to his purpose than
the most fashionable london dentist the day
st leger swift never did frenchman exceed
him in volubility utterance or in gesture
significant supplying all that words might fear
or fail to tell never was he surpassed by prattling
barber or privileged hunchback in ancient
or modem story arabian or persian but he was

triumphing in his sf avoir dire st leger swift
was known to everybody knew everybody in
london that was to be or was not to be known
every creature dead or alive that ever had
been or was about to be celebrated fashionable
or rich or clever or notorious roue
or murderer about to be married or about
to be hanged for that last class persons
enjoys in our days a strange kind heroic
celebrity which voltaire might well have
been jealous st leger was course hand
and glove with all the royal family every
illustrious personage every most illustrious
personage had in turn sat in his chair he had
had all their heads in their turns in his hands
and he had capital anecdotes and sayings 
each with which he charmed away the sense 
pain in loyal subjects but with scandal for
the fair was he specially provided never did
man or woman skim the surface tittletattle 
society or dive better breathless into family
mysteries none with more careless air could
at the same time talk and listen extract your
news and give you his on dit or tell the secret
which you first reveal there was in him and
helen 
about him such an air reckless cordial coxcombry
it warmed the coldest threw the
most cautious off their guard brought out
family secrets as if he had been one your
family your secret purpose as though he had
been a secular father confessor as safe everything
told to st leger swift he would swear
to you as if known only to yourself he would
swear and you would believe unless peculiarly
constituted as was the lady who this
morning took her seat in his chair 
miss clarendon she was accompanied by
her aunt mrs pennant
 ha old lady and young lady fresh from
the country both i see persons family's
 condition said st leger to himself on
that point his practised eye could not mistake
even at first glance and accordingly it was
really doing himself a pleasure and these
ladies as he conceived it a pleasure a service
and an honour to put them immediately on
their arrival in town au courant du jour
whether to pull or not to pull a tooth that had
offended was tlje professional question before
him
 helen
miss clarendon threw back her head and
opened her mouth
 fine teeth fine nothing to complain 
here surely said st leger as fine a
show ivory as ever i beheld pon my
reputation i know many a fine lady who
would giveall but her eyes for such a
set
 i must have this tooth out said miss
clarendon pointing to the offender
i see certainly ma'am as you say

said her tenderhearted aunt if it could be
any way avoided 
by all means madam as you say we
must do nothing without considerations
i have considered my dear aunt said
miss clarendon i have not slept these
three nights
 but you do not consider that you caught
cold getting up one night for me and it maybe
only an accidental cold my dear esther
i should be so sorry if you were to lose a tooth
don't be in a hurry once gone you cannot
get it back again
helen 
 never was a truer wiser word spoken
madame said st leger swiftly whisking himself
round and as if looking for some essential
implement may be a mere twinge accidental
cold rheumatism or may be my
dear madame to the aunt i will trouble
you let me pass i beg pardon one word
with you and with his back to the patient in
the chair while he rummaged among ivory
handled instruments on the table he went on
in a low voice to the aunt is she nervous

hoping the name would be supplied but that

so raising his voice to the aunt as he went
on looking or seeming to look at the nieces
tooth he continued rapidly from wales

 helbni
and can assure you to my private certain
knowledge that man stood high on the pinnacle
 favour with a certain royal personage for
often sitting in this very chair 
keep your mouth open a little longer 
little wider my good miss pennant here s
a little something for me to do nothing any
consequence only touch and go nothing
to be taken away no no must not lose one
 these fine teeth that most illustrious personage
said one day to me sitting in this very
chair swift said he st leger swift familiarly
condescendingly colloquially st
leger swift my good fellow said he
but positively my dear miss um um
if you have not patience you must sit still
pardon me professionally i must be peremptory
impossible i could hiirt can't conceive
 did not touch only making a perquisition
disquisitions say what you please
but you are nervous ma'am i aninly taking
a general survey
apropos general survey general a
friend mine general clarendon is just come
to town my ears must have played me false
helen 
but i thought my man said something like
clarendon when he shewed you up 
no answer from miss clarendon who held
her mouth open wide as desired resolved not
to satisfy his curiosity but to let him blunder
on
 be that as it may general clarendons
come to town fine teeth he has too and a
fine kettle fish not very elegant but expressive
still he and his ward have made that
marriage announced fine young man though
that beauclerc finest young man almost x
ever saw 
but here mr st leger swift starting suddenly
withdrawing his hand from miss clarendon's
mouth exclaimed
my finger ma'am but never mind never
mind all in the day's work casualty contingencies
 no consequence but as i was
saying mr granville beauclerc 
then poured out on the encouragement 
one look curiosity from mrs pennant all the
on dits lady katrine hawksbyby and all her
chorus and all the best authorities and st
leger swift was ready to pledge himself to the
s helen
truth every word he positively knew that
the marriage was off and thought as everybody
did that the young gentleman was well
off too for besides the young lady's great
fortune turning out not a sous and here he
supplied the halftold tale by a drawn up ugly
face and shrugging gesture
 shocking shocking au came to an eclat
 esclandre a scene quite last night i am
told at my friend lady castleforts sad 
sad so young a lady but to give you a
general idea loveletters to come out in the
memoirs that fashionable roue friend 
mine too fine fellow as ever breathed only
a little you understand colonel daubigny
poor d'aubigny height only if the 
comes out miss stanley y 
mrs pennant looked at her niece in benevolent
anxiety miss clarendon was firmly silent 
but st leger catching from the expression 
both ladies countenances that they were interested
in the contrary direction to what he
had anticipated turned to the right about and
observed
helen s
 this may be all scandal one the innumerable
daily false reports that are always
flying about town scandal all i have no
doubt your head a little to the right if you
please and the publication will be stopped
 course and the young iadys friendsyou
are interested for her i see so am ialways
am for the young and fair that s my foible 
and indeed confidently i can inform you 
if you could keep your head still my dear
madam
but miss clarendon could bear it no longer 
starting from under his hand she exclaimed
 no more thank youno more at present
sir we can call another day no more and
added as she hastily left the room better
bear the toothache and ran down stairs mrs
pennant slipped into the dentist hand as he
pulled the bell a double fee for though she
did not quite think he deserved it much yet
she felt it necessary to make amends for her
nieces way running ofi which might not be
thrust quite civil
thank you nla'am thank ye ma'am 
 helens
not the least occasion don't say a word about
it young lady's nervous said so from the firsts
nerves nerves all open the door there
nerves all were the last words at the top
 the stairs st leger swift was heard to say
and the first words kind mrs pennant as
soon as she was in the carriage and had drawn
up the glass were do you know esther my
dear i am quite sorry fbr this poor miss stanley
though i don't know her yet as you
described her to me she was such a pretty
young interesting creature i am quite sorry
 i don't believe a word it said miss
clarendon
 but even to have such things said must be
so distressing to her and to her lover your
friend mr beauclerc so very distressing 
i hope they are not such fools as to be
distressed about such stuff all this insufferable
talking man's invention i dare say
 why do people tell such things said
mrs pennant but my dear esther veii
supposing it to be all false it is shocking to
have such things spoken i city the poor
young lady and her lover do you not think
helen 
my dear we shall be able to enquire into the
truth the matter from your brother this
evening he must know he ought to know
about it whether the report be true or false he
should he saw his note she never even took
notice that he did not particularly mention her
 helen
the flowers from him were enough she knew
his sincerity so well trusted to it so completely
that she was quite sure if he had been
angry with her he would not have sent these
tokens his love slight tokens though they
were all sufficient for her her fears had
ten but one direction and in that direction
they were all dispelled he would be at breakfast
tomorrow when she should know where
he had been and what had detained him from
her the whole this day she told cecilia
that she was now quite well but that she
would not attempt to go down stairs and
cecilia left her happy so far at least and
when she was alone with her flowers she
doubly enjoyed them inhaling the fragrance
 each which she knew he particularly liked
and thanking him in her heart for the careful
choice for she was certain that they were not
accidentally put together some them were
associated with little circumstances known only
to themselves awakening recollections bright
happy moments and selected she was sure
with reference to a recent conversation they
had had on the language flowers
helen 
whether helen fancied half this or whether
it was all true it had the effect soothing and
pleasing her anxious agitated mind and she
was the more ready to indulge in that pleasant
reverie from all that she had previously suffered
herself and all that she feared beauclerc
had yet to endure she knew too well how
much these reports would affect him and hear
them he must she considered what trials he
had already borne and might still have to bear
for her sake whatever course she might now
pursue though soon very soon the whole
would be told to him yet still though she
might stand clear in his eyes as to the main
points he must and would blame her weakness
in first consenting to this deception he who
was above deceit she had not absolutely told
but she had admitted a falsehood she had
acted a falsehood this she could not extenuate
her motive at first to save lady davenant's
life was good but then her weakness
afterwards in being persuaded time after time
by cecilia could not well be excused she
was conscious that she had sunk step by step
dragged down that slippery path by cecilia
 helen
instead firmly making a stand as she ought
to have done and upholding by her own integrity
her friends failing truth
with returning anguish seifreproach she
went over and over these thoughts she considered
the nfany unforeseen circumstances that
had occurred so much public shame so
much misery had been brought upon herself
and on all she loved by this one false step i
and how much more might still await her
notwithstanding all that best friends the
general had done she recollected how
much he had done for her thinking her
too as he must with lowered esteem and
that was the most painful thought all 
to beauclerc she could and would soon clear
her truth but to the general never perhaps
completely 
her head was leaning on her hand as she
was sitting deep in these thoughts when she
was startled by an unusual knock at her door
it was cockbum with a packet which general
clarendon had ordered him to deliver
into miss stanleyss own hands
the instant she saw the packet she knew
helen 
that it contained the and on opening it
she found manuscript letters inserted between
the marked pages and there was a note from
general clarendon
she trembled she foreboded ill
the note began by informing miss stanley
how the enclosed manuscript letters came into
general clarendon's hands from a person whom
miss stanley had obliged and who had hoped
in return to do her some service the general
next begged miss stanley to understand
that these letters had been put into his possession
since his conversation with her at
breakfasttime his only design in urging her
to mark her share in the printed letters had
been to obtain her authority for serving her
to the best his ability but he had since
compared them and then came references
without comment to the discrepancies between
the marked passages the uniform character 
the omissions followed only by a single note
 admiration at each from the generals pen
and at last in cold polite phrase came his
regret that he had not been able to obtain
that confidence which he had trusted he had
 helen
deserved and his renunciation all future interference
in her affairs or concerns had been
written but a broad dash the pen had
erased the superfluous words and then came the
inevitable conclusion on which helenass eyes
fixed and remained immoveable for some time
that determination which general clarendon
had announced to his wife in the first heat
 indignation but which lady cecilia had
hoped could be evaded changed postponed
would not at least be so suddenly declared
to helen therefore she had given her no hint
had in no way prepared her for the blow 
and with the full force astonishment it came
upon her 
 general clarendon cannot have the pleasure
he had proposed to himself j giving miss
stanley at the altar to his ward he cannot
by any public act his attest his consent to
that marriage which in his private opinion
he no longer approves
and he is right o cecilia was helen's
first thought when she could think after this
shock not her marriage not herself
helen 
not beauclerc but cecilia's falsehood 
cecilia's selfish cowardice she thought and
could not conceive it possible could not believe
it though it was there incredible yet
proved there there before her eyes 
brought home keen to her heart after all at
such a time after her most solemn promise
with so little temptation so utterly false with
every possible motive that a good mind could
have to be true in this last trial her friend's
whole character at stake ungenerous base 
o cecilia how different from what i thought
you or how changed and i have helped
to bring her to this i i have been the
cause i will not stay in this house i will
leave her to save her to save myself 
save my own truth and my own real character
let the rest go as it will the world think
what it may farther and farther lower and
lower i have gone i will not go lower i will
struggle up again at any risk at any sacrifice
this is a sacrifice lady davenant would approve
 she said that if ever i should be
convinced that general clarendon did not wish
 helen
me to be his guest if he should ever cease
to esteem me i should go that instant 
and i will go but where 
to whom could she fly to whom turn the
collingwoods were gone all her uncles friends
passed rapidly through her recollection since
she had been living with general and lady
cecilia clarendon several had written to invite
her but helen knew a little more the world
now than formerly and she felt that there was
not one no not one all these to whom she
could now at her utmost need turn and say
 i am in distress receive me my character is
attacked defend me my truth is doubted believe
in me 
and her heart beating with anxiety she
tried to think what was to be done there was
an old mrs medlicott who had been a housekeeper
 her uncle's living at seven oaks
she would go there she should be safe 
she should be independent she knew that she
was then in town and was to go to seven oaks
the next day she resolved to send rose early in
the morning to mrs medlicotts lodging which
helen 
was near grosvenor square to desire her to call
at general clarendon's as she went out town
at eight o'clock she could then go with her to
seven oaks and by setting out before cecilia
could be up she should avoid seeing her again
there are minds which totally sink and
others that wonderfully rise under the urgency
 strong motive and perilous circumstance
it is not always the mind apparently strongest
or most daring that stands the test the firm
 principle are those most courageous in time
 need helen had determined what her
course should be and once determined she was
calm
she sat down and wrote to general clarendon

miss stanley regrets that she cannot explain
to general clarendon the circumstances
vtrhich have so much displeased him she assures
him that no want confidence has been
on her part the cause but she cannot expect
that without further explanation he should
give her credit for sincerity
 helen
she feels that with his view her conduct
and in his situation his determination is right
that it is what she has deserved that it is just
towards his ward and due to his own character
she hopes however that he will not think it necessary
to announce to mr beauclerc his determination
 withdrawing his approbation and
consent to his marriage when she informs him
that it will now never be by her claimed or accepted

 she trusts that general clarendon will permit
her to take upon herself the breaking off this
union she encloses a letter to mr beauclerc
which she begs may be given to him tomorrow
general clarendon will find she has dissolved
their engagement as decidedly as he
could desire and that her decision will be irrevocable

 and since general clarendon has ceased to
esteem her miss stanley cannot longer accept
his protection or encroach upon his hospitality
she trusts that he will not consider it as any
want respect that she has resolved to retire
from his family as soon as possible
she is certain having a safe and respectable

able home with a former housekeeper her
uncle dean stanley's who will call for her at
eight o'clock tomorrow and take her to seven
oaks where she resides miss stanley has
named that early hour that she may not meet
mr beauclerc before she goes she wishes also
to avoid the struggle and agony parting with
lady cecilia she entreats general clarendon
will prevent lady cecilia from attempting to see
her in the morning and permit her to go unobserved
out the house at her appointed hour
so now farewell my dear friend yes
friend this last time you must permit me to
call you for such i feel you have ever been
and ever would have been to me if my folly
would have permitted believe me notwithstanding
the deception which i acknowledge
i have been guilty towards you oeneral clarendon
 i venture to say believe we i am not
ungrateful at this instant my heart swells
with gratitude while i pray that you may be
happy happy as you deserve to be but you
will read this with disdain as mere idle words 
so be it farewell 
helen stanley
 helen
next she was to write to beauderc himsel
her letter was as follows 
with my whole heart dear granville i
thank you for the generous confidence you have
shown towards me and for the invariable steadiness
 your faith and love for your sake
i rejoice one good has at least resulted from
the trials you have gone through you must
now and hereafter feel sure your own strength
 mind with me it has been different for i
have not a strong mind i have been all weakness
and must now be miserable but wicked
i will not be and wicked i should be if i took
advantage your confiding love i must disappoint
your affectionsbut your confidence will
not betray when i put your love to that
test which it has so nobly stood i had hoped
that a time would come when all doubts would
be cleared up and when i could reward your
constancy by the devotion my whole happy
life but that hope is past i cannot prove my
innocence i will no longer allow you to take
it upon my assertion i cannot indeed with
truth even assert that i have done no wrong 
helen 
for though i am not false i have gone on step
by step in deception and might go on i know
not hove far nor to what dreadful consequences
if i did not now stop and i do stop on my
own head be the penalty my fault upon
my own happiness my owt character i will
not involve yours therefore we part you
have not yet heard all that has been said 
me but you soon will and you will feel as
i do that i am not fit to be your wife
your wife should not be suspected i have
been i am all the happiness i can ever
have in this world must henceforth be in the
thought having saved from misery if not
secured the happiness those i love leave
me this hope oh granville do not tell me
do not make me believe that you will never
be happy without me you will indeed
you will i only pray heaven that you may
find love as true as mine and strength to abide
by the truth 
 do not write to me do not try to persuade
me to change my determination it is
irrevocable further writing or meeting could
be only useless anguish to us both give me
 helen
the sole consolation i can now have and which
you alone can give let me hear from cecilia
that you and your nobleminded guardian are
after i am gone as good friends as you were
before you knew me
i shall be goh from this house before you
are here again i cannot stay where i can dono
good and might do much evil by remaining
even a few hours longer as it is comfort your
generous heart on my account with the assurance
that i am sustained by the consciousness
that i am now to the best my power doing
right
adieu granville be happy you can 
you have done no wrong be happy and that
will console yojir true friend 
helen stanley
this enclosed to general clarendon she
sent by cockburn who delivered it to his master
immediately
though she could perfectly depend upon her
maid rose's fidelity helen did not tell her that
she was going away in the morning to avoid
bringing her into any difficulty if she were
helen 
questioned by lady cecilia and besides no
note preparation would be heard or seen
she would take with her only sufficient for the
day and would leave rose to pack up all that
belonged to her after her departure and to
follow her thanks to her own late discretion
she had no money difficulties no debts
but such as rose could settle and she had
now only to write to cecilia but she had not
yet recovered from the tumult mind which
the writing to the general and to beauclerc
had caused
she lay down upon the sofa and closing her
trembling eyelids she tried to compose herself
sufficiently to think at least what she was to
say as she passed the table in going to the
sofa she without perceiving it threw down
some the flowers they caught her eye and
she said to herself lie there lie there 
granville last gifts last gifts to me allover
now lie there and wither joys that are
passed wither all happiness for me gone 
lie there and wither and die and so shall
i soon i hope if that only hope is not
wrong
vol k
 helen
some one knocked at the door she started
up and said i cannot see you cecilia 
a voice not cecilia a voice she did not
recollect answered it is not cecilia let me
see you i come from oeneral clarendon
helen opened the door tod saw miss clarendon
 her voice had sounded so much
lower and gentler than usual that helen had
not guessed it to be her's she was cloaked as
if prepared to go away and in the outer room
was another lady seated with her back towards
them and with her cloak on also
 my aunt pennant who will wait for me
as she is a stranger she would not intrude
upon you miss stanley but will you allow me
one minute 
helen surprised begged miss clarendon to
come in moved a chair towards her and stood
breathless with anxiety miss clarendon sat
down and resuming her abruptness tone
said i feel that i have no right to expect that
you should have confidence in me and yet i do
i believe in your sincerity even from the little
i know you and i have a notion you believe
in mine do you 
i
helen 
i wish it had pleased heaven continued
miss clarendon that my brother had married
a woman who could speak truth but
you need not be afraid i will not touch on
your secrets on any matter you have in keeping
my honour as well as your's will command
my silence as will also my brother's happiness
which i have somewhat at heart not that
i think it can be preserved by the means you
take but this is not what i came to say you
mean to go away from this house tomorrow
morning 
 yes said helen
 you are right i would not stay where i
did not esteem or where i had reason to believe
that i was not esteemed you are quite
right to go and to go directly but not to your
old housekeeper
why not said helen
because though i dare say she is vastly
respectable an excellent person in her way i
am convinced yet my brother says she might
not be thought just the sort person to whom
you should go now not just the thing for you
k
c
 helen
at present though at another time it would
be very well and condescending but now
when you are attacked you must look to appearances
 in short my brother will not allow
you to go to this old lady's boardinghouse or
cottage or whatever it may be at seven oaks 
be niust be able to say for you where you are
gone you must be with me you must be at
llansiuen llansillen is a place that can be
named you must be with me with general
clarendon's sister you must you will i
am sure my dear miss stanley i never was
so happy in having a house my own as at
this moment you will not refuse to return
with my aunt and me to llansillen and make
our home your's we will try and make it a
happy home to you try you see the sense
 it the world can say nothing when you
are known to be with miss clarendon and you
will i hope feel the comfort it out the
stir and din this london world i know
you like the country and llansillen is a beautiful
place romantic too a fine castle an
excellent library beautiful conservatory famous
for our conservatories we are in south
helen 
wales and no neighbours singular blessing 
and my aunt pennant you will love her so 
will you try come say that you will
but helen could not she could only press
the hand that miss clarendon held out to
her there is nothing more touching more
overcoming than kindness at the moment the
heart is sunk in despair but did general
clarendon really wish you to ask me said
helen when she could speak did he think
so much and so carefully for me to the last 
and with such a bad opinion as he must have
 me 
 but there you know he is wrong
 it is like himself continued helen 
 consistent in protecting me to the last oh
to lose such a friend 
not lost only mislaid said miss clarendon
 you will find him again some fair day
or other truth always comes to light meanwhile
all is settled i must run and tell my aunt
and bless the fates and lady emily greville
that lady cecilia did not come up in the mid
die it luckily she thinks i am gone and
knows nothing my being with you for my
 helen
brother explained all this to me in his study
after we had left the saloon and he desires me
to say that his carriage shall be ready for you
at your hour at eight o'clock we shall expect
you and now farewell till tomorrow
she was gone and her motto might well be
though in a different acceptation from that 
our greatest modern politician tout faire
sans paraitrej
but before helen could go to rest she
must write to lady cecilia and her thoughts
were in such perplexity and her feelings in
such conflict that she knew not how to begin
at last she wrote only a few hasty lines 
farewell and referred for her determination
and for all explanations to her letter to the
general it came to farewell dear cecilia
dear yes still dear she was to helen she
must be as lady davenants daughter still
dear for her own sake was cecilia the companion
 her childhood who had shown her
such generous affection early such fondness
always who was so charming with so many
good qualities so much to win love loved she
must be still
helen 
 farewell cecilia may you be happy 
but as helen wrote these words she thought
it impossible she could scarcely in the present
circumstances wish it possible that cecilia
should be happy how could she unless her
conscience had become quite callous 
she gave her note to rose with orders to
deliver it herself to lady cecilia tonight when
she should demand admittance
and soon she came the very instant lady
emily greville went away before helen was
in bed she heard cecilia at her door she
left her to parley with rose heard her voice
in the first instance eager peremptory for
admittance then a sudden silence helen
comprehended that she had opened her note
and in another instant she heard her retreating
step on seeing the first words referring
for explanation to helenass letter to the general
panicstruck lady cecilia hurried to her
own room to read the rest privately
helen now tried to recollect whether everything
had been said written done that ought
to be done and at last went to bed and endeavoured
to sleep for a few hours
 helen
chapter x
helen was just dressed and had given her
last orders to her bewildered maid when she
heard a knock at the door and mademoiselle
felicities voice she could not at this instant
endure to hear her heartless exclamatory
speeches she would not admit her mademoiselle
felicie gave rose a note for her
young lady it was from cecilia
deadest helen
the general will not allow me to
take leave you this morning but i shall
certainly go to you in the course today
i cannot understand or make you understand
anything till i see you i will see you today
your affectionate
cecilia
helen sot
i understand it too well thought helen
the carriage was announced helen was
ready she hurried into it and she was gone 
and thus she parted from the friend her
childhood the friend she had but a few
months before met with such joy such true
affection and her own affection was true to
the last 
as helen drove from the door she saw the
general yes it certainly was the general
riding off at this unusual hour was it
to avoid her but she was in too great anguish
to dwell upon that or any other circumstance
 her only thought now was to subdue
her emotion before she was seen by miss clarendon
and mrs pennant and by the time she
arrived she thought she had quite recovered
herself and was not aware that any traces 
tears remained but to mrs pennant sympathising
eyes they were visible and after the
first introductions and salutations were over
that kind lady as she seated her at the 
gently pressing her hand said
 poor thing no wonder parting with old
friends for new is a sad trial but you know
k
s helen
we shall become old friends in time we will
make what haste we can my dear miss stanley
and esther will help me to make you forget
that you have not known us all your life's
 there is very little to be known no mysteries
that is one comfort said miss clarendon
 so now to breakfast you are very
punctual miss stanley and that is a virtue
which aunt pennant likes and can estimate to
a fraction a minute with that excellent watch
ofhers
there was some history belonging to that
family watch which then came out and then
the conversation turned upon little family anecdotes
and subjects which were naturally interesting
to the aunt and niece and not exciting
to helen whose mind they saw needed quiet
and freedom from all observation
from the first awkwardness her situation
from the sense intrusion and the suddenness
 change she was thus as far as possible gradually
and almost imperceptibly relieved by
their perfect good breeding as well as good
nature from their making no effort to show her
particular attention she felt received at once
helen 
into their family as one themselves and
yet though there was no effort she perceived
in the most minute circumstances the same sort
 consideration thich would be shown to an
intimate friend
they not only did not expect but did not
irish that she should make any exertion to
appear to be what she could not be they knew
the loneliness heart she must feel the weight
that must be upon her spirits they left
her then quite at liberty to be with them or
alone as she might like and she was glad
to be alone with her own thoughts they soon
fixed upon beauclerc she considered how
he would feel what he would think when he
should receive her letter she pictured his looks
ibie reading it considered whether he would
write immediately or attempt notwithstanding
her prohibition to see her he would know
from general clarendon that is if the general
thought proper to tell him where she was and
that she would remain all this day in town
though her determination was fixed whether
he wrote or came to abide by her refusal and
for the unanswerable reasons which she had
 helen
given or which she had laid down to herself
yet she could not and who loving as she did
could help wishing that beauclerc should desire
to see her again she hoped that he would
make every effort to change her resolution
even though it might cost them both pain
yet in some pain there is pleasure or to be
without it is a worse kind suffering
helen was conscious the inconsistency in
her mind and sighed and tried to be as reasonable
as she could be and to do her justice
there was not the slightest wavering as to
the iqain point she thought that the general
might perhaps have some relenting towards
her hope would come into her mind though
she tried to keep it out she had nothing to
expect she repeatedly said to herself except
that either cecilia would send or the general
would call this morning and rose must come
at all events
the morning passed on however and no one
came so soon as helen had expected she was
sitting in a back room where no knocks at the
door could be heard but she would have been
called surely if general clarendon had come
i
helen s
he had come but be had not asked for
her he had at first inquired only for his sister
but she was not at home gone to the dentist
the general then desired to see mrs pennant
and when she supposed that she had not
heard rightly and that miss stanley must bethe
person he wished to see he had answered
 by no means i particularly wish not to see
miss stanley i beg to see mrs pennant
alone
it fell to the lot this gentle tenderhearted
lady to communicate to helen the dreadful intelligence
he brought a duel had taken place 
when helen had seen the general riding
off he was on his way to chalk farm just
as the carriage was coming round for miss
stanley mr beauclerk groom had requested
in great haste to see the general he said he
was sure something was going wrong about his
master he had heard the words chalk farm
the general was off instantly but before he
reached the spot the duel had been fought
a duel between beauclerc and mr churchill
beauclerc was safe but mr churchill was
dangerously wounded the medical people pre
 helen
sent could not answer for his life al the time
the general saw him he was speechless but
when beauclerc and his second lord betrayers
had come up to him he had extended
his hand in token forgiveness to one or the
other but to which he had addressed the only
words he had uttered could not be ascertained 
the words were you are not to blame 
escape i fly 
both had fled to the continent general
clarendon said that he had no time for explanations
he had not been able to get any intelligible
account the cause the affair
lord beltravers had named miss stanley
but beauclerc had stopped him and had expressed
the greatest anxiety that miss stanleyss
name should not be implicated should not be
mentioned he took the whole blame upon
himself said he would write there was no
time for more
mrs pennant listened with the dread 
losing a single word but however brief his
expressions the genere's manner speaking
notwithstanding the intensity his emotion
was so distinct that every word was audible
helen s
except the name lord betrayers which was
not familiar to her she asked again the name
 mr beauclerk second lord betrayers
the general repeated with a forcible accent and
loosening his neckcloth with his finger he
added rascal i as i always told beauclerc
that he was and so he will find him too
late
except this exacerbation the general was
calmly reserved in speech and mrs pennant
felt that she could not ask him a single question
beyond what he had communicated when
he rose to go which he did the moment he had
finished what he had to say she had however
courage enough to hope that they should soon
hear again when the general should learn something
more mr churchill
certainly he would let her know whatever
he could learn mr churchill's state
her eyes followed him to the door with
anxious eagerness to penetrate farther into
what his own opinion the danger might be
his rigidity composure made her fear that
he had no hope otherwise certainly he would
have said something
 helen
he opened the door again and returning
said
depend upon it you shall hear how he is
my dear mrs pennant before you leave town
tosorrow's
we will not go tomorrow she replied
we will stay another day at least poor
miss stanley will be so anxious 
i advise you not to stay in town another
day my dear madam you can do no good by
it if mr churchill survive this day he will
linger long i am assured take helen take
miss stanley out town as soon as may be
better go tomorrow as you had determined
but it will be so long my dear general 
one moment if we go it will be so long before
we can hear any further news your wards
 i will write
to miss stanley oh thank you
 to my sister he looked back to say and
repeated distinctly to my sister
 very well thank you at all events
mrs pennant saw that in general clarendon's
present disposition towards miss stanley
the less she said him the better and she coni

helen 
fined herself strictly to what she had been commissioned
to say and all she could do was to
prevent the added pain suspense it was told
to helen in the simplest shortest manner possible
 but the facts were dreadful
beauclerc was safe safe but under what
circumstances an exile perhaps a murderer 
 and it was for me i am sure cried helen
 i am sure it was for me i was the cause 
i am the cause that man's death beau 
clerc's agony
for some time helen had not power or
thought for any other idea the promise that
they should hear as soon as they could learn
anything more mr churchill's state was all
she could rely upon or recur to
when her maid rose arrived from general
clarendon's she said that when lady cecilia
heard the duel she had been taken very ill
but had since recovered sufficiently to drive
out with the general miss clarendon assured
helen there was no danger it is too deep
a misfortune for lady cecilia her feelings
have not depth enough for it you will see
you need not be afraid for her helen
 helen
the circumstances which led to the dud were
not clearly known till long afterwards but maybe
now related
the moment beauclerc had parted from
helen when he turned away at the marriage
door after the party at lady castlefort's he
went in search one who as he hoped could
explain the strange whispers he had heard
the person whom he went in search was his
friend his friend as he deemed him lord beltravers
churchill had suggested that if anybody
knew the bottom the matter except
that origin all evil lady katrine herself 
it must be lord beltravers with whom lady
castlefort was it was said oremei emprise and
as horace observed the secrets scandal are
common property between lovers much modern
love being cemented by hate
without taking in the full force this observation
in its particular application to the
hatred which lord beltravers might feel to
miss stanley as the successful rival his
sister blanche beauclerc hastened to act upon
his suggestion his lordship was not at home 
his people thought he had been at lady castlehelen

fort's did not know where he might be if not
there at some gamblinghouse beauclerc at
last found him and lord beltravers was suff
gently vexed in the first place at being there
found for he had pretended to his friend granville
that he no longer played
his embarrassment was increased by the
questions which beauclerc so suddenly put to
him but he had nonchalance impudence enough
to brave it through and he depended with
good reason on beauclerk's prepossession in his
favour he protested he knew nothing about
it and he returned churchill's charge by
throwing the whole blame upon him said he
knew he was in league with lady katrine 
mentioned that one morning some time ago he
had dropped in unexpectedly early at lady
castlefort's and had been surprised to find the
two sisters contrary to their wont together 
their heads and horace churchill's over some
manuscript which was shuffled away as he
entered 
this was true all but the shuffling away
and here it is necessary to form a clear notion
clearer than lord beltravers will give the
 helen
different shares wrong wrong knowingly
and unknowingly perpetrated by the several
scandalmongers concerned in this affair
lord beltravers could be in no doubt as to
his own share for he it was who had furnished
the editor colonel d'aubigny's memoirs
with the famous letters when carlos lady
davenant's runaway page escaped from clarendon
park having changed his name he got
into the service sir thomas d'aubigny who
was just at this time arranging his brother's
papers now it had happened that carlos had
been concealed behind the skreen in lady
davenant's room the day her first conversation
with helen about colonel d'aubigny and
he had understood enough it to perceive that
there was some mystery about the colonel with
either helen or lady cecilia and chancing
one day soon after he entered sir thomas's
service to find his escritoire open he amused
himself with looking over his papers among
which he discovered the packet lady cecilia's
letters carlos was not perfectly sure 
the handwriting he thought it was lady cecilia's
 but when he found the miniature miss
helen 
stanley along with them he concluded that
the letters must be heres and having special
reasons for feeling vengeance against helen
and certain at all events doing mischief he
sent them to general clarendon not however
forgetting his old trade he copied them first
this was just at the time when lord beltravers
returned from abroad after his sisters divorce
he by some accident found out who carlos was
and whence he came and full his own views
for his sister he crossexamined him as to
everything he knew about miss stanley and
partly by bribes partly by threats betraying
him to lady davenant he contrived to get
from him the copied letters carlos soon after
returned with his master to portugal and was
never more heard 
lord beltravers took these purloined copies
 the letters thus surreptitiously obtained
to the editor into whose hands sir thomas
b'aubigny who knew nothing books
or bookmaking had puthis brother's memoirs
this editor as has been mentioned
had previously consulted mr churchill and
in consequence his pepper and salt hint
 helen
lord beltravers himself made those interpose
tiods which he hoped should ruin his sisters
rival in the eyes her lover
mr churchill however except this hint
and except his vanity in furnishing a good
title and his coxcombry literary patronage
and his general hope that helenass name being
implicated in such a publication would avenge
her rejection himself had had nothing to do
with the business this lord beltravers well
knew and yet when he found that the slander
made no impression upon beauclerk and that
he was only intent upon discovering the slanderer
he with dexterous treachery contrived
to turn the tables upon churchill and to direct
all beauclerk suspicion towards him he
took his friend home with him and shewed
him all the newspaper paragraphs paragraphs
which he himself had written yes this man
 romantic friendship this blaze this hero
oppressed with his own sensibility could condescend
to write anonymous scandal to league
with newsmongers and to bribe waitingwomeil
to supply him with information for mademoiselle
felicie had through lady katrines maid
helen 
told all and more than all she knew what
passed at general clarendon's and on this
foundation did beauclerk friend construct
those paragraphs which he hoped would blast
the character the woman to whom he was
engaged and now he contrived to say all that
could convince beauclerc that mr churchill
was the author these very paragraphs
and straight and hot and rash beauclerc
rushed on to that conclusion he wrote a
challenge to churchill and as soon as it was
possible in the morning he sent it by lord
beltravers 
mr churchill named sir john luttrell as
his friend lord beltravers would enter into
no terms accommodation the challenge was
accepted chalk farm appointed as the place
 meeting and the time fixed for eight o'clock
next morning
and thus partly by his own warmth 
temper and partly by the falsehood others
was beauclerc urged on to the action he detested
to be the thing he hated duelling
and duellists had from the time he could think
been his abhorrence and now he was to 
 helen
his life or to take the life a fellow creature
perhaps in a duel
there was a dread interval and it was
during the remainder this day and night
that beauclerk felt most strongly compared
with all other earthly ties his attachment his
passionate love for helen at every pause at
every close other thoughts forced upon him
his mind recurred to helen what helen would
feel what helen would think what she would
suffer and in the most and in the least important
things his care was for her he recalled
the last look that he had seen at the 
when they parted recollected that
it expressed anxiety was conscious that he
had turned away abruptly that in the preoccupied
state his mind he had not spoken
one word kindness and that this might bethe
last impression him left on her mind
he knew that her anxiety would increase when
all that day must pass without his return and
it was then he thought sending her those
flowers which would he knew reassure her
better than any words he could venture to
write
helen 
meanwhile his false friend coldly calculated
what were the chances in his sister's favour
and when churchill feu and even in
the hurry their immediate departure lord
beltravers wrote t madame de st cymon
over whom the present state her affairs
gave him command to order her to set out
immediately and to take blanche with her
to paris without asking the consent that
fool and prude her aunt lady grace
it was well for poor helen even in the
dreadful uncertainty in which she left london
i that she did not know all these circumstances
it may be doubted indeed whether we should
be altogether happier in this life if that worst
 evils as it is often called suspense were
absolutely annihilated and if human creatures
could clearly see their fate or even know what
is most likely to happen
vol iii
helen
chapter xi
according to the generals advice mrs
pennant did not delay her journey and helen
left london the next day with her and miss
clarendon
the last bulletin mr churchill had been
that he was still in great danger and a few
scarce legible lines helen had received from
cecilia saying that the general would not
allow her to agitate herself by going td take
leave her that she was glad that helen was
to be out town till all blew over and that
she was so much distracted by this horrible
event she scarcely knew what she wrote
as they drove out town miss clarendon
in hopes turning helenass thoughts went on
talking
 unless said isle we could like madame
de gentis promote the postboys into agents
helen 
 mystery and romances we have but little
chance i am afraid any adventures on
our journey to llansillen my dear miss
stanley
she inveighed against the stupid safety
convenience luxury and expedition travelling
nowadays all over england even in
wales so that one might sleep the whole
way from hyde park corner to llansillen
gate said she and have no unconscionably
long nap either no difficulties on the road
nothing to complain at inns no enjoying
one's dear delight in being angry no opportunity
even showing one's charming resignation
dreadfully bad this for the nervous and
bilious for all the real use and benefit tray
veiling is done away all too easy for my taste
one might as well be a doll or a dolt or a
parcel in the coach
helen would have been glad to have been
considered merely as a parcel in the coach
during the whole journey she took no notice
 anything till they came within a few miles
 llansillen then endeavouring to sympathise
with her companion she looked out
l
 helen
 the carriage window at the prospect which
they admired but however charming llangollen
had not for helen the chief charm
 early fond old associations with a happy
home to her it was to be she doubted
not as happy as kindness could make it
but still it was new tnd in that thought
that feeling there was something inexpressibly
melancholy and the contrast at this
moment between her sensations and those 
her companions made the pain the more poignant
 they perceived this and were silent
helen was grateful for this consideration for
her but she could not bear to be a constraint
upon them therefore side now exerted herself
sat forward admired and talked when she was
scarcely able to speak by the time they came
to llansillen gate she could say no more
she was obliged to acknowledge that she was
not well and when the carriage at last
stopped at the door there was such a throbbing
in her temples and she was altogether
so ill that it was with the greatest difficulty
she could leaning on miss clarendons arm
mount time high steps to the halldoor she
helen 
could scarcely stand when she reached the
top but making an effort she went on
crossed the slippery floor that great hall
and came to the foot the black oak staircase
 which the steps were so very low that
she thought she could easily go up but found
it impossible and she was carried up straight
to miss clarendons own room no other having
been yet prepared the rosy welsh maids
looked with pity on the pale stranger they
hurried to and fro talking welsh to one another
very fast and helen felt as if she were
in a foreign land and in a dream
the the matter was that she had a
low fever which lasted long it was more dispiriting
than dangerous more tedious than
alarming her illness continued for many
weeks during which time she was attended
most painfully by her two new friends by
miss clarendon with the utmost zeal and actio
mrs pennant with the greatest solicitude
and tenderness
her history for these weeks indeed for some
months afterwards can be only the diary
 an invalid and a convalescent miss
 helen
clarendon meanwhile received from her brother
punctually once a week bulletins churchill
health the surgical details the fears 
the formation internal abscess reports 
continual exfoliations bone were judiciously
suppressed and the laconic general reported
only much the same not progressing
 cannot be pronounced out danger
these bulletins were duly repeated to helen
whenever she was able to hear them and at
last she was considered well enough to read
various letters which had arrived for her during
her illness several were from lady cecilia
but little in them the first was full only 
expressions regret and selfreproach in the
last she said she hoped soon to have a right
to claim helen back again this underlined
passage helen knew alluded to the promise
she had once made that at the birth her
child all should be told but words promise
from cecilia had lost all value all power to
excite even hope as she said to herself as she
read the words and sighed
one her letters mentioned what sh would
have seen in the first newspaper she had opened
helen 
that lady blanche forrester was gone with
her sister the comtesse de st cymon to paris
to join her brother lord beltravers but
lady cecilia observed that helen need not be
alarmed by this paragraph which she was sure
was inserted on purpose to plague her lady
cecilia seemed to take it for granted that her
rejection beauclerc was only a ruse clamour
aid went on with her usual hopes now vague
and more vague every letter that things would
 well sometime somehow or other
helen only sighed on reading these letters
and quick as she glanced her eye over them
threw them from her on the bed and miss
clarendon said
ay you know her now i see 
helen made no reply she was careful
not to make any comment which could betray
how much or what sort reason she
had to complain lady cecilia but miss
clarendon confident that she had guessed
pretty nearly the truth was satisfied with her
own penetration and then after seeming tq
doubt for a few moments she put another
letter into helenass hand and with one those
sf helen
looks tender interest which sometimes softened
her countenance she left the room
the letter was from beauclerc it appeared
to have been written immediately after he had
received helens letter and was as follows 

not write to you my dearest helen 
renounce my claim to your hand f submit to
be rejected by you my advanced bride no
never never doubt suspicion suspicion
 you you angel as you are you who
have devoted sacrificed yourself to others no
helen my admiration my love my trust in
you are greater than they ever were and do
 dare to say these words to you who am
perhaps a murderer i ought to imitate your
generosity i ought not to offer you a hand
stained with blood i ought at least to leave
you free till i know when i may return from
banishment i have written this at the first
instant i have been able to command during
my hurried journey and as you know something
 what led to this unhappy business
you shall in my next letter hear the whole till
then adieu granville bbauclbrc
helen 
the next day when she thought helen
sufficiently recovered from the agitation reading
beauclerc's letter aunt pennant produced
one letter more which she had kept for the
last because she hoped it would give pleasure
to her patient
helen sat up in her bed eagerly and stretched
out her hand the letter was directed by
general clarendon but that was only the outer
cover they knew for he had mentioned in his
last despatch to his sister that the letter enclosed
for miss stanley was from lady davenant
helen tore off the cover but the instant
she saw the inner direction she sank back
turned and hid her face on the pillow
it was directed 
to mrs granville beauclerk
lady davenant had unfortunately taken it
for granted that nothing could have prevented
the marriage
aunt pennant blamed herself for not having
foreseen and prevented this accident which
she saw distressed poor helen so much but
miss clarendon wondered that she was so
shocked and supposed she would get over it
l
 helen
in a few minutes or else she must be very
weak
there was nothing that tended to raise her
spirits much in the letter itsdf to make amends
for the shock the direction had given it contained
but a few lines in lady davenants own
handwriting and a postscript from lord davenant
she wrote only to announce their safe
arrival at petersburg as she was obliged to
send off her letter before she had received any
despatches from england and she concluded
with
i am sure the first will bring me the joyful
news beauclercs happiness and yours
my dear child
lord davenants postscript added that in
truth lady davenant much needed such a
cordial for that her health had suffered even
more than he had feared it would he repented
that he had allowed her to accompany
him to such a rigorous climate
all that could be said to allay the apprehensions
this postscript might excite was course
said in the best way by aunt pennant but it
was plain that helen did not recover during
helen 
the whole this day from the shock she had
felt from that foolish direction as miss
clarendon said
she could not be prevailed upon to rise this
day though miss clarendon after feeding her
pulse had declared that she was very well able
to get up it was very bad for her to remain
in bed
this was true no doubt and miss clan
tendon remarked to her aunt that she was surprised
to find miss stanley so weak
her aunt replied that it was not surprising
that she should be rather weak at present after
such a long illness
 weakness body and mind need not go
together said miss clarendon
need not perhaps said her aunt but
they are apt to do so
l it is to be hoped the weakness mind
will go with the weakness body and soon
said miss clarendon
we must do what we can to strengthen
and fatten her poor thing said mrs pennant
 fatten the body rather easier than to
strengthen the mind strength mind cannot
 helen
be thrown in as you would throw in the bark
or the chicken broth
only have patience with hers said mrs
pennant and you will find that she will have
strength mind enough when she gets quite
well only have patiejice
during helen's illness miss clarendon had
been patient but now that she was pronounced
convalescent she became eager to see her quite
well in time need miss clarendon had
been not only the most active and zealous buta
most gentle and doubt it who may softstepping
softvoiced nurse but now when
doctor tudor had assured them that all fever
was gone and agreed with her that the patient
would soon be well if she would only think
so miss clarendon deemed it high time to
use something more than her milder influence
to become if not a rugged at least a stem
nurse and she brought out some her rigid
lore
 i intend that you should get up in reasonable
time today helens said she as she entered
her room
do you said helen in a languid voice
r
helen 
 i dos said miss clarendon and i hope
you do not intend to do as you did yesterday
to lie in bed all days
helen turned sighed and mrs pennant
said yesterday is over my dear esther no
use in talking yesterday
 only to secure our doing better today
maam replied miss clarendon with prompt
ability
helen was all submission and she got up
and that was well miss clarendon went inquest
 arrowroot judiciously and aunt pennant
stayed and nourished her patient meanwhile
with the fostering dew praise 
and let her dress as slowly and move as languidly
as she liked though miss clarendon
had admonished her not to dawdle
as soon as she was dressed helen went to
the window and threw up the sash for the first
time to enjoy the fresh air and to see the
prospect which she was told was beautiful and
she saw that it was beautiful and though it
was still winter she felt that the air was balmy
and the sun shone bright and the grass began
to be green for spring approached but how
 helen
different to her from the springtime former
years nature the same but all within herself
how changed and all which used to please
and to seem to her most cheerful now came
over her spirits with a sense sadness she
felt as if all the life life was gone
tears filled her eyes large tears rolled slowly
down as she stood fixed seeming to gaze from
that window at she knew not what aunt pennant
unperceived stood beside her and let the
tears flow unnoticed they will do her good 
they are a great relief sometimes
miss clarendon returned and the tears were
dried but the glaze remained and miss clarendon
saw it and gave a reproachful look at
her aunt as much as to say why did you let
her cry and her aunts look in reply was
i could not help it my dear
 eat your arrowroots was all that transpired
to helen
and she tried to eat but could not and
miss clarendon was not well pleased for the
arrowroot was good and she had made it 
she felt miss stanleyss pulse and said that it
was as good a pulse as could be only low and
a little fluttered
helen 

do not flutter it any more then esther
my dears said mrs pennant
 what am i doing or saying ma'am that
should flutter anybody that has common sense p
 some people don't like to have their pulse
felt said aunt pennant
 those people have not common senses replied
the niece
i believe i have not common senses said
helen
sense you have enough resolution is
what you want helen i tell you
i know said helen too true 
true but not too true nothing can be
too true
true said helen with languid submission

helen was not in a condition to chop logic
or ever much inclined to it now less than ever
and least all with miss clarendon so able
as she was there is something very provoking
sometimes in perfect submission because
it is unanswerable but the languor not the
submission afforded some cause for further
remark and remonstrance
ss helen
helen you are dreadfully languid today
sadly said helen
if you could have eaten more arrowroot
before it grew cold you would have been
better
 but if she could not my dear esther
said aunt pennant
 could not madam as if people could
not eat if they pleased
but if people have no appetite my dear
imam afraid eating will not do much good
 i am afraid my dear aunt you will not
do miss stanley much good said miss clarendon
shaking her head you will only spot
her
 i am quite spoiled i believe said helen 
you must unspoil me esther
not so very easy said esther but i
shall try for i am a sincere friend
i am sure it said helen
then what snore could be said 
nothing at that time helens look was so
sincerely grateful and gentle as a lamb as
aunt pennant observed and esther was nota
wolf quite at heart not at all
helen dismiss
clarendon presently remarked that
miss stanley really did not seem glad to be
better glad to get well
helen acknowledged that instead being
glad she was rather sorry if it had pleased
heaven i should have been glad to die
 nonsense about dying and worse than
nonsense cried miss clarendon when you
see thst it did not please heaven that you
should die
 i am content to live said helen
 content to be sure you are said miss
clarendon is this your thankfulness to
providence 
i am resigned i am thankful i will
try to be more so but i cannot be so glad
general clarendon's bulletins continued with
little variation for some time they were always
to his sister he never mentioned beauclerc
but confined himself to the few lines or words
necessary to give his promised regular accounts
 mr churchill's state the sum which
continued to be for a length time much
the same not in immediate danger 
cannot be pronounced out danger
it
s helen
not very consolatory helen felt but
while there is life there is hopes as aunt
pennant observed 
 yes and fears said helen and her hopes
and fears on this subject alternated with fatiguing
reiteration and with a total incapacity
 forming any judgment
beauclerc's letter explanation arrived and
other letters came from him from time to
time which as they were only repetitions 
hopes and fears as to ghurchiirs recovery and
 uncertainty as to what might be his own
future fate only increased helen's misery 
and as even their expressions devoted attachment
could not alter her own determination
while she felt how crud her continued
silence must appear they only agitated without
relieving her mind mrs pennant sympathised
with and soothed her tmd knew how
to soothe and how to raise and to sustain a
mind in sorrow suffering under disappointed
affection and sunk almost to despondency
for aunt pennant besides her softness 
manner and her quick intelligent sympathy
helen shad
power consolation a higher sort beyond
any which this world can give she was
very religious a cheerfully religious turn
 mind that truly christian spirit which
loveth all things
when she was a child somebody asked her
if she was bred up in the fear the lord
she said no but in the love good and so
she was in that love which casteth out fear
and now the mildness her piety and the
whole tone and manner her speaking and
thinking reminded helen that good dear
uncle by whom she had been educated she
listened with affectionate reverence and she
truly and simply said you do me good 
i think you have done me a great deal good
 and you shall sese it
and she did see it afterwards and miss
clarendon thought it was her doing and so
her aunt let it pass and was only glad the
good was done
the first day helen went down to the 
she found there a man who looked
as she thought at first glance like a tradesman
 helen
some person she supposed come on business
standing waiting for miss clarendon or
mrs pennant she scarcely looked at him
but passed on to the sofa beside which was a
little table set for her and on it a beautiful
workbox which she began to examine and
admire
 not nigh so handsome as i could have
wished it then for you miss helen i ask
pardon miss stanley
helen looked up surprised at hearing herself
addressed by one whom she had thought a
stranger but yet she knew the voice and a
reminiscence came across her mind having
seen him somewhere before
old david price ma'am maybe you
forget him you being a child at that time
but since you grew up you have been the
saving me and many more stepping
quite close to her he whispered that he had
been paid under her goodness order by mr
james along with the other creditors that had
been left
helen by this time recollected who the poor
welshman was an upholsterer and cabinethelen

maker who had been years before employed
at the deanery never having been paid at
the time a very considerable debt had accumulated
and having neither note nor bond
price said that he had despaired ever
obtaining the amount his earnings he
had however since the deans death been
paid in full and had been able to retire to
his native village which happened to be near
llangollen and most grateful he was and as
soon as he perceived that he was recognised
his gratitude became better able to express
itself not well however could it make its
way out for some time between crying and
laughing and between two languages he was
at first scarcely intelligible whenever much
moved david price had recourse to his native
welsh in which he was eloquent and mrs
pennant on whom knowing that she understood
him his eyes turned was good enough to
interpret for him
and when once fairly set going there was
danger that poor david's garrulous gratitude
should flow for ever but it was all honest 
not a word flattery and his old face was
 helen
in a glow and radiant with feeling and the joy
 telling miss helen all how and about it 
particularly concerning the last day when mr
james paid him and them and all them 
that was a day miss stanley ought to have
seen pity she could not have witnessed it it
would have done her good to the latest hour 
her life pity she should never see the faces
 many some poorer they might have been
than himself many richer that would have
been ruined for ever but for her for his own
part he reckoned himself one the happiest 
them all in being allowed to see her face to
face and he hoped as soon as she was able to
get out so far but it was not so far she would
come to see how comfortable he was in his own
house
it ended at last in his giving a shove to the
workbox on the table which though nothing
worth otherwise he knew she could not mislike
on account it was made out all the
samples wood the dean her uncle had given
to him in former times
notwithstanding the immoderate length 
his speeches and the impossibility he seemed
helen 
to find ending his visit helen was not much
tired and when she was able to walk so far
mrs pennant took her to see david price
and in a most comfortable house she found him
and every one in that house down to the
youngest child gathered round her by degrees
some more some less shy but all with gratitude
beaming and smiling in their faces
it was delightful to helen for there is noh
man heart so engrossed by sorrow so overwhelmed
by disappointment so closed against
hope happiness that will not open to the
touch gratitude
 helen
chapter xii
but there was still in helenass inmost soul
one deceitful hope she thought she had pulled
it up by the roots many times and the last time
completely but still a little fibre lurked and
still it grew again it was the hope that cecilia
would keep that last promise though at the
moment helen had flung from her the possibility
yet now she took it up again and she
thought it was possible that cecilia might be
true to her word if her child should be born
alive and if it should be a boy 
it became a heartbeating suspense as the
time approached and every day the news might
be expected the post came in but three times
a week at llansillen and every post day miss
clarendon repeated her prophecy to her aunt
you will see ma'am the child will be born in
good time and alive you who have always
helen fl
been so much afraid for lady cecilia will
find she has not feeling enough to do her
any harm
in due time came a note from the general
 a boy child and mother doing well
give me joy
the joy to miss clarendon was much increased
by the triumph in her own perfectly
right opinion mrs pennant's was pure affectionate
joy for the father and for lady cecilia
for whom au sinner as she was in her niece's
eyes this good soul had compassion helen's
anxiety to hear again and again every post was
very natural the aunt thought quite superfluous
the niece deemed it lady cecilia would
do very well no doubt she prophesied again
and laughed at the tremor the eagerness with
ihich helen every day asked if there was
any letter from cecilia at last one came the
first in her own handwriting and it was to
helen herself and it extinguished all hope
helen could only articulate oh cecilia 
her emotion her disappointment were visible
but unaccountable she could give no reason
for it to miss clarendon whose wondering
vol iii m
i
 helen
eye was upon her nor even to sympathising
aunt pennant could she breathe a word without
betraying cecilia she was silent and there
was all that day and many succeeding days a
hopelessness languor in her whole appearance
there was as miss clarendon termed ita
backsliding in her recovery which grieved
aunt pennant and helen had to bear imputation
 caprice and indolence from miss
clarendon but even that eye immediately
upon her that eye more severe than ever had
not power to rouse her her soul was sunk
within nothing farther to hope there was a
dead calm and the stillness and loneliness 
llansillen made that calm almost awful the
life great excitation which she had led previous
to her illness rendered her more sensible
 the change the total want stimulus
the walks to price's cottage had been repeated
but though it was ever a bright spot the eye
could not always be fixed upon it
bodily exertion being more easy to her now
than mental she took long walks and came in
boasting how far she had been and looking
quite exhausted and miss clarendon won
helen 
tered at her wandering out alone then she tried
to walk with miss clarendon and she was more
tired though the walks were shorter and that
was observed and was not agreeable either to
the observer or to the observed
helen endeavoured to make up for it she
followed miss clarendon about in au her various
occupations from flowergarden to conservatory
and from conservatory to pleasantry
and to all her pretty cottages and her schools
and she saw and admired all the good that
esther did so judiciously and with such extraordinary
such wonderful energy
nothing wonderful in it miss clarendon
said and as she ungraciously rejected praise
however sincere and required not sympathy
helen was reduced to be a mere silent stupid
useless standerby and she could not but feel
this a little awkward she tried to interest
herself for the poor people in the neighbourhood
but their language was unintelligible to
her and her's to them and it is hard work trying
to make objects for oneself in quite a new
place and with a preoccupying sorrow in the
mind all the time it was not only hard work
m 
 helen
to helen but it seemed labour in vain bringing
soil by handfuls to a barren rock whereafter
all no plant will take root miss clarendon
thought that labour could never be in vain
one morning when it must be acknowledged
that helen had been sitting too long in the
same position with her head leaning on her
hand miss clarendon in her abrupt voice
asked how much longer helen do you
intend to sit there doing only what is the
worst thing in the world for you thinking
helen started and said she feared she had
been sitting too long idle
if you wish to know how long i can tell
you said miss clarendon just one hour
and thirteen minutes
by the stop watches said helen smiling
by my watch said grave miss clarendon 
fand in the mean time look at the quantity 
work i have done
and done so nicely said helen looking
at it with admiration
oh do not think to bribe me with admiration
i would rather see you do something
yourself than hear you praise my doings

helen 
if i had anybody to work for i have so
few friends now in the world who would care
for anything i could do but i will try you
shall see my dear esther by and by
by and by no no now i cannot bear
to see you any longer in this halfalive halfdead
states
i know said helen that all you say is
for my good i am sure your only object is
my happiness
your happiness is not in my power or in
yours but it is in your power to deserve to be
happy by doing what is right by exerting
yourself that is my object for i see you are
in danger being lost in indolence now you
have the truth and the whole truth
many a truth would have come mended from
miss clarendon's tongue if it had been uttered
in a softer tone and if she had paid a little
more attention to times and seasons but she
held it the sacred duty sincerity to tell a
friend her faults as soon as seen and without
circumlocution
the next day helen set about a drawing
she made it an object to herself to try to
 helen
copy a view the dear deanery in the same
style as several beautiful drawings miss
clarendons
while she looked over her portfolio several
 her old sketches recalled remembrances
which made her sigh frequently miss clarendon
heard her and said i wish you
would cure yourself that habit sighing 
it is very bad for your's
i know it said helen
despondency is not penitence continued
esther reverie is not reparation
in this sort interminable warfare against
despondency and indolence miss clarendon
was always in the right but wrong in too much
proving herself in the right as half her knowledge
 the human heart and a quarter her
good sense would have shewn her had not
both been obscured by little clouds temper
she felt as desirous as ever to make helen
happy at llansillen but she was provoked to
find it impossible to do so a strong body
herself capable great resistance powerful
reaction under disappointment or grief she
could ill make allowance for feebler health and
helen 
spirits perhaps feebler character for great
misfortunes she had great sympathy but she
could not enter into the details lesser sorrows
especially any the sentimental kind which
she was apt to class altogether under the head
 sorrows my lord lumcake an expression
which had sovereignly taken her fancy
and which her aunt did not relish or quite
understand
mrs pennant was indeed as complete a
contrast to her niece in these points as nature
and habit joined could produce she was naturally
 the most exquisitely sympathetic 
shrinking and expanding to the
touch others joy or woe and instead having
by long use worn this out she had preserved
it wonderfully fresh in advanced years but
notwithstanding the contrast and seemingly
incompatible difference between this aunt and
niece the foundations their characters both
being good sound and true they lived on
together well and loved each other dearly
they had seldom differed so much on any point 
a in the present case as to their treatment 
their patient and their guest scarcely a day
 helen
passed in which they did not come to some
mutual remonstrance and sometimes when she
was by which was not pleasant to her as maybe
imagined yet perhaps even these little
altercations and annoyances though they tried
helen's temper or grieved her heart at the
moment were use to her upon the whole
by drawing her out herself besides these
daily vicissitudes made by human temper
manner and character supplied in some sort
the total want events and broke the monotony
xf these tedious months
the general's bulletins however became at
last more favourable mr churchill was decidedly
better his physician hoped he might
soon be pronounced omit danger the general
said nothing beauclerc but that he
was he believed still at paris and from this
time forward no more letters came from beauclerc
to helen as his hopes churchill's
recovery increased he expected every day to
be released from his banishment and was resolved
to write no more till he could say that
he was free but helen though she did not
allow it to herself felt this deeply she thought
helen 
that her determined silence had at last convines
him that all pursuit her was vain 
and that he submitted to her rejection she
told herself it was what should be and yet she
felt it bitterly
lady cecilia's letters did not mention him
indeed they scarcely told any thing they had
become short and constrained the general
she said advised her to go out more and her
letters often concluded in haste with carriage
at the doors and all the usual excuses 
a london life
one day when helen was sitting intently
drawing miss clarendon said helen so
suddenly that she started and looked round 
miss clarendon was seated on a low stool at
her aunt's feet with one arm thrown over her
great dog's neck he had laid his head on her
lap and resting on him she looked up with a
steadiness a fixity repose which brought
to helen's mind raphael's beautiful figure 
fortitude leaning on her lion she thought she
had never before seen miss clarendon look so
handsome so graceful so interesting she took
care not to say so however
m 
s helen
helen t continued miss clarendon do
you remember the time when iwas at clarendon
 park and quitted it so abruptly my
reasons were good whatever my manner was 
the opinion the world i am not apt to fear
for myself or even for my brother but to the
whispers insolence i do listen helen i
was conscious that certain feelings in my mind
were too strg in me you would scarcely
believe it too tender i had no reason to
think that granville beauderc liked me it was
therefore utterly unfit that i should think 
him i felt this i left clarendon park and
from that moment i have refused myself the
pleasure his society i have altogether ceased
to think him this is the only way to conquer
a hopeless attachment but you helen
though you have commanded him never to
attempt to see you again have not been
able to command your own mind since mr
churchill is so much better you expect that
he will soon be pronounced out danger 
you expect that mr beauclerc will come overcome
hereward be at your feet 
 i expect nothings said helen in a fall

helen 
tearing voice and then added resolutely i
cannot foresee what mr beauclerc may do
but this be assured miss clarendon that
until i stand as i once stood and as i deserve
to stand in the opinion your brother unless
above all i can bring proofs to granville's
confiding heart that i have ever been
unimpeachable conduct and mind and
in all but one circumstance true true as
yourself esther never never though your
brother and all the world consented never
till i myself felt that i was proved to be as
worthy to be his wife as i think i am would
i consent to marry him no not though my
heart were to break
i believe it said mrs pennant and i
wish oh how i wish 
that lady cecilia were hanged as she
deserves said miss clarendon so do i i
am sure but that is nothing to the present
purpose
no indeed said helen
helen i continued esther remember
that lady blanche forrester is at paris
helen shrank
 helen 
it
lady cecilia tells you there is no danger 
i say there is
why should you say so my dear esther 
said her aunt
has not this friend yours always deceived
misled you helen 
she can have no motive for deceiving mein
this said helen i believe her
believe her then cried miss clarendon 
believe her and do not believe me and take
the consequences i have done
helen sighed but though she might fed the
want the charm lady cecilia's suavity 
manner her agreeable and her agreeing
temper yet she felt the safe solidity principle
in her present friend and admired esteemed
and loved without fear change her
unflinching truth pretty ornaments gold
cannot be worked out the native ore to
make the rude mass ductile some alloy must
be used and when the slight filigree captivating
manner comes to be tested against the
sterling worth unalloyed sincerity weighed
in the just balance adversity we are glad
to seize the solid gold and leave the ornaments
to those that they deceive

helen 
the fear about lady blanche forrester
was however soon set at rest and this time
lady cecilia was right a letter from her
to helen announced that lady blanche was
married actually married and not to granville
beauclerc but to some other english
gentleman at paris no matter whom lord
beltravers and madame de st cymon disappointed
had returned to london lady cecilia
had seen lord beltravers and heard the
news from him
there could be no doubt the truth the
intelligence and scarcely did helen herself
rejoice in it with more sincerity than did miss
clarendon and helen loved her for her candour
as well as for her sympathy
time passed on week after week rolled
away
at last general clarendon announced to his
sister but without one word to helen that
mr churchill was pronounced out danger
the news had been sent to his ward the general
said and he expected granville would
return from his banishment immediately
quite taken up in the first tumult her
v
 helen
feelings at this intelligence helen scarcely observed
that she had no letter from cecilia
but even aunt pennant was obliged to confess
in reply to her niece's observation that
this was certainly very odd but we shall
soon hear some explanation i hopes
miss clarendon shook her head she said
that she had always thought how matters
would she judged from her brother's letters
that he began to find out that he was not
the happiest men yet nothing to that
effect was ever said by him one phrase only
excepted in his letter to her on her last birthday
which began with in our happy days
my dear esther
miss clarendon said nothing to helen upon
this subject she refrained altogether from
mentioning lady cecilia
two three postdays passed without bringing
any letter to helen the fourth very
early in the morning long before the usual
time for the arrival the post rose came
into her room with a letter in her hand saying
from general clarendon ma'am his own
man mr cockburn has just this minute
arrived ma'am from london
helen 
with a trembling hand helen tore the letter
open not one word from general clarendon 
it was only a cover containing two notes one
from lord davenant to the general the other
from lady davenant to helen
lord davenant said that lady davenant's
health had declined so alarmingly after their
arrival at petersburg that he had insisted
upon her return to england and that as soon
as the object his mission was completed he
should immediately follow her a vessel he
said containing letters from england had been
lost so that they were in total ignorance 
what had occurred at home and indeed it
appeared from the direction lady davenantes
note to helen written on her landing
in england that she had left russia without
knowing that the marriage had been broken
off or that helen had quitted general clarendon's
she wrote let me see you and
granville once more before i die be in london
at my own house to meet me i shall be
there as soon as i can be moved
the initials only her name were signed
elliott added a postscript saying that her lady
 helen
had suffered much from an unusually long
passage and that she was not sure what day
they could be in town
there was nothing from lady cecilia 
cockburn said that her ladyship had not been
at home when he set out that his master had
ordered him to travel all night to get to llangollen
as fast as possible and to make no delay
in delivering the letter to miss stanley
to set out instantly to be in town at her
house to meet lady davenant was course
helenass immediate determination general
clarendon had sent his travellingcarriage for
her and under the circumstances her friends
could have no wish but to speed her departure
miss clarendon expressed surprise at there
being no letter from lady cecilia and would
see and question cockburn herself but nothing
more was to be learned than what he had
already told that the packet from lady davenant
had come by express to his master after
lady cecilia had driven out as it had been her
custom late almost every day to kensington
to see her child
nothing could be more natural mrs penhelen

nant thought and she only wondered at
esther's unconvinced look suspicion nothing
surely can be more natural my dear
esther
to which esther replied very likely
ina'am
helen was too much hurried and too much
engrossed by the one idea lady davenant to
think what they said
at parting she had scarcely time even to
thank her two friends for all their kindness
but they understood her feelings and as miss
clarendon said words on that point were unnecessary
aunt pennant embraced her again
and again and then let her go saying i
must not detain you my dear
but i must said miss clarendon for
one moment there is one point on which my
parting words are necessary helen keep
clear lady cecilia's affairs whatever they
may be hear none her secrets
helen wished she had never heard any did
nt believe there were any more to hear but
she promised herself and miss clarendon that
she would observe this excellent counsel
 helen
and now she was in the carriage and on
her road to town and now she had leisure
to breathe and to think and to feel her
thoughts and feelings however could be only
repetitions fears and hopes about lady
davenant and uncertainty and dread what
would happen when she should require explanation
 all that had occurred in her absence
and how would lady cecilia be able to meet
her mother's penetration ill or well lady
davenant was so clearsighted and how
shall i thought helen without plunging
deeper in deceit avoid revealing the truth 
shall i assist cecilia to deceive her mother in
her last moments or shall i break my promise
betray ceciliass secret and at last be the death
 her mother by the shock p
it is astonishing how often the mind can go
over the same thoughts and feelings without
coming to any conclusion any ease from racking
suspense in the mean time on rolled the
carriage and cockburn according to his master's
directions got her over the ground withall
conceivable speed
helen 
chapter xiii
when they were within the last stage 
london the carriage suddenly stopped and
helen who was sitting far back deep in
her endless reverie started forward cockburn
was at the carriagedoor
my lady coming to meet you miss
stanley
it was cecilia herself but cecilia so
changed in her whole appearance that helen
ifvould scarcely have known her she was so
much struck that she hardly knew what was
said but the carriagedoors were opened and
lady cecilia was beside her and cockburn
shut the door without permitting one moment's
delay and on they drove
lady cecilia was excessively agitated
helen had not power to utter a word and was
glad that cecilia went on speaking very fast
 helen
though she spoke without appearing to knowwell
what she was saying helen's goodness
in coming so quickly her fears that she
would never have been in time but she was
in time her mother had not yet arrived
clarendon had gone to meet her on the road
she believed she was not quite certain
that seemed very extraordinary to helen
not quite certain said she
no i am not replied cecilia and she
coloured her very pale cheek flushed but she
explained not at all she left that subject and
spoke the friends helen had left at llangollen
 then suddenly her mother's return 
her hopes her fears and then without going
on to the natural idea seeing her mother
and how soon they should see her began
to talk beauclerc mr churches
being quite out danger the generals
expectation beauclerk immediate return
and then my dearest helens said she all
will be 
oh i do not know how it will be i cried
she her tone changing suddenly and from
the breathless hurry in which she had been
helen 
running on sinking at once to a low broken
tone and speaking very slowly i cannot
tell what will become any us we can
never be happy again any one us and
it is all my doing and i cannot die oh
helen when i tell you 
she stopped and miss clarendon's warning
counsel all her own past experience were full
in helenass mind and after a moments silence
she stopped cecilia just as she seemed to have
gathered power to speak and begged that she
would not tell her anything that was to be
kept secret she could not would not hear
any secrets she turned her head aside and let
down the glass and looked out as if determined
not to be compelled to receive this confidence

 have you then lost all interest all affection
for me helen i deserve it but you
need not fear me now helen i have done
with deception would to heaven i had never
begun with it t
it was the tone and look truth she
steadily fixed her eyes upon helen and instead
 the bright beams that used to play in
 helen
those eyes there was now a dark deepseated
sorrow almost despair
helen was deeply moved it was indeed impossible
for her it would have been impossible
for any one who had any feeling to have looked
upon lady cecilia clarendon at that moment
and to have recollected what she had so
lately been without pity the friend her
childhood looked upon her with all the poignant
anguish compassion 
oh my dear cecilia how changed 
helen was not sensible that she uttered the
words how changed 
changed yes i believe i am said lady
cecilia in a calm voice very much changed
in appearance but much more in reality my
mind is more altered than my person
oh helen if you could see into my
mind at this moment and know how completely
it is changed but it is all in vain now 
you have suffered and suffered for me but
your sufferings could not equal mine you
lost love and happiness but still conscious
 deserving both i had both at my com
helen 
and and i could enjoy neither under the
consciousness the torture remorse
helen threw her arms round her and exclaimed
 do not think me all will be
well since you have resolved on the truth all
will yet be well
cecilia sighed deeply and went on i
am sure helen you were surprised that my
child was born alive at least i was i believe
its mother had not feeling enough to
endanger its existence well clarendon has
that comfort at all events and as a boy it will
never put him in mind his mother
well helen i had hopes myself to the
last minute i really and truly hoped as i told
you that i should have had courage to tell him
all when i put the child into his arms but his
joy i could not dash his joy i could not 
and then i thought i never could i knew
you would give me up i gave up all hope
 myself i was very unhappy and clarendon
thought i was very ill and i acknowledged
that i was anxious about you and let
all the blame fall on you innocent generous
s helen
creature i heard my husband perpetually
upbraiding you when he saw me ill all he
said the consequences your falsehood and
all the time i knew it was my own
 my dear helen it is impossible to tell you
all the daily hourly necessities for dissimulation
which occurred every day you know
we were to send to inquire for mr churchill
and every day when clarendon brought me the
bulletin he pitied me and blamed you and
the double dealing in my countenance he never
suspected always interpreted favourably oh
such confidence as he had in me sand how it has
been wasted abused then letters from beauclerc
 how i bore to hear them read i cannot
conceive and at each time that i escaped
i rejoiced and reproached myself and re
preached myself and rejoiced i succeeded in
every effort at deception and was cursed by my
own success encouraged to proceed t soon
went on without shame and without fear my
husband heard me defending you against the
various reports which my venomous cousin had
circulated and he only admired what he called
my amiable zeal his love for me increased
helen 
but it gave me no pleasure for helen now i
am going to tell you an extraordinary turn
which my mind took for which i cannot accounts
can hardly believe it it seems out
 human nature my love for him decreased 
not only because i felt that he would hate me
if he discovered my deceit but because he was
lowered in my estimation i i had always had
as everybody has even my mother the highest
opinion his judgment to that judgment
i had always looked up it had raised me in
my own opinion it was a motive to me to be
equal to what he thought me but now that
motive was gone i no longer looked up to him 
his credulous affection had blinded his judgment
 he was my dupe i could not reverences
could not love one who was my dupe
but i cannot tell you how shocked i was at
myself when i felt my love for him decrease
every time i saw him
 i thought myself a monster i had grown
used to everything but that that i could not
endure it was a darkness the mind a coldness
 it was as if the sun had gone out the
universe it was more it was worse it was as
vol in n
 helen
if i was alone in the world home was a desert
to me i went out every evening sometimes
but rarely clarendon accompanied me he had
become more retired his spirits had declined
with mine and though he was glad i should
go out and amuse myself yet he was always
exact as to the hours my return i was
often late later than i ought to have been
and i made a multitude paltry excuses this
it was i believe which first shook his faith in
my truth but i was soon detected in a more
decided failure
you know i never had the least taste for
play any kind you may remember i used
to be scolded for never minding what i was
about at ecarte in short i never had the
least love for it it wearied me but now that
my spirits were gone it was a sort intoxication
in which i cannot say i indulged for it
was no indulgence but to which i had recourse
louisa castlefort you know was always
fond play got into her first difficulties
by that means she led me on i lost a good
deal money to her and did not care about
it as long as i could pay but presently it
helen 
came to a time when i could not pay without
applying to the general i applied to him
but under false pretences to pay this bill
or that or to buy something which i never
bought this occurred so often and to such
extent that he suspected he discovered
how it went he told me so he spoke in that
low suppressed that terrible voice which i
had heard once before i said i know not
what in deprecation his anger i am
not angry cecilia said he i caught his
hand and would have detained him he withdrew
that hand and looking at me exclaimed
beautiful creature half those charms would
i give for truth p he left the room and
there was contempt in his look
all my love all my reverence returned
for bin in an instant but what could i say 
he never recurred to the subject and now
when i saw the struggle in his mind my pas
sion for him returned in all its force
 people who flattered me often you know
said i was fascinating and i determined to
use my powers fascination to regain my
husband's heart how little i knew that heart 
n
 helen
i dressed to please him oh i never dressed
myself with such care in my most coquettish
days i gave a splendid ball i danced to
please him he used to be delighted with my
dancing he had said no matter what but i
wanted to make him say it feel it again he
neither said nor felt it i saw him standing
looking at me and at the close the dance i
heard from him one sigh i was more in love
with him than when first we were married and
he saw it but that did not restore me to his
confidence his esteem nothing could have
done that but what i had not one step
in dissimulation led to another
after lord beltravers returned ram parison
lady branches marriage i used to meet
him continually at louisa castleforts as for
play that was over with me for ever but i
went to louisa's continually because it was
the gayest house i could go to i used to meet
lord beltravers there and he pretended to
pay me a vast deal attention to which i
was utterly indifferent but his object was to
push his sister into society again by my means
he took advantage that unfortunate note
helen 

which i had received from madame de st
cymon when she was at old forest he wanted
me to admit her among mj acquaintance 
he urged it in every possible way and was excessively
vexed that it would not do not that
lie cared for her he often spoke her in a way
that shocked me but it hurt his pride that she
should be excluded from the society to which
her rank entitled her
i had met her at louisa once or twice
but when i found that for her brother's sake
she was always to be invited i resolved to go
there no more and i made a merit this with
clarendon he was pleased he said that
is well that is right my dear cecilia
 and he went out more with me one night
at the opera the comtesse de st cymon was
in the box opposite to us no lady with her
only some gentlemen she watched me i did
all i could to avoid her eye but at an unlucky
moment she caught mine bent forward
and had the assurance to bow the general
snatched the operaglass from my hand made
sure who it was and then said to me
 how does that woman dare to claim your
 helen
notice lady cecilia i am afraid there must
have been some encouragement on your parts
 none said i nor ever shall be you
see i take no notice
 but you must have taken notice or this
could never be 
 no indeed persisted 
helen i really forgot at the moment that
first unfortunate note an instant afterwards
i recollected it and the visit about the cameos
but that was not my fault i had to be sure
dropped a card in return at her door and i
ought to have mentioned that but i really did
not recollect it till the words had passed my
lips and then it was too late and i did not like
to go back and spoil my case by an exception
 the general did not look quite satisfied 
he did not receive my assertions as implicitly
as formerly he left the box afterwards to
speak to some one and while he was gone in
came lord beltravers after some preliminary
nothings he went directly to the point
and said in an assured manner i believe you
do not know my sister at this distance she has
been endeavouring to catch your eye
helen 
 the comtesse de st cymon does me too
much honours said i with a slight inclination
 the head and elevation the eyebrow
which spoke sufficiently plainly
 unabashed and with a most provoking
almost sneering look he replied madame
de st cymon had wished to say a few words
to your ladyship on your own account am
i to understand this cannot be 
 on my own account said i i do not
in the least understand your lordships i
am not sure said he that i perfectly comprehend
it but i know that you sometimes
drive to kensington and sometimes take a
turn in the gardens there my sister lives at
kensington and could not she without infringing
etiquette meet you in your walk and
have the honour a few words with you 
something she wants to say to you and here
he lowered his voice about a locket and
colonel d'aubigny
excessively frightened and hearing someone
at the door i answered i do not know
i believe i shall drive to kensington tomorrow
he bowed delighted and relieved
 helen
me from his presence that instant the moment
afterwards general clarendon came in
he asked me was not that lord beltravers
whom i met 
 yes said i he came to reproach me
for not noticing his sister and i answered him
in such a manner as to make him dear that
there was no hope

there is a handsome parish church in the town
 woodstock i am told so at least for i never
saw it having scarce time when at the place to
view the magnificence blenheim its painted
halls and tapestried bowers and then return indue
season to dine in hall with my learned friend
the provost being one those occasions
on which a man wrongs himself extremely if he
lets his curiosity interfere with his punctuality i
had the church accurately described to me with
woodstock
a view to this work but as i have some reason
to doubt whether my informant had ever seen the
inside it himself i will be content to say that
it is now a handsome edifice most part which
was rebuilt forty or fifty years since although it
still contains some arches the old chantry
founded it is said by king john but it is to
this more ancient part the building that my
story refers
upon a morning in the september or
beginning october in the year being a
day appointed for a solemn thanksgiving for the
decisive victory at worcester a respectable audience
was assembled in the old chantry or chapel
 king john the condition the church
and character the audience both bore witness
to the rage civil war and the peculiar spirit 
the times the sacred edifice showed many marks
 dilapidation the windows once filled with
stained glass had been dashed to pieces with
pikes and muskets as matters and pertaining
to idolatry the carving on the readingdesk
was damaged and two fair screens beautiful
sculptured oak had been destroyed for the same
woodstock 
pithy and conclusive reason the high altar had
been removed and the gilded railing which was
once around it was broken down and carried off
the effigies several tombs were mutilated and
now lay scattered about the church
torn from their destined niche unworthy meed
 knightly counsel or heroic deed
the autumn wind piped through empty aisles in
which the remains stakes and premisses roughhewn
timber as well as a quantity scattered
hay and trampled straw seemed to intimate that
the hallowed precincts had been upon some late
emergency made the quarters a troop horse
the audience like the building was abated
in splendour none the ancient and habitual
worshippers during peaceful times were now to
 seen in their carved galleries with hands shadowing
their brows while composing their minds
to pray where their fathers had prayed and after
the same mode worship the eye the
yeoman and peasant sought in vain the tall form
 old sir henry lee ditchley as wrapped
in his laced cloak and with beard and whiskers
duly composed he moved slowly through the
woodstock
aisles followed by the faithful raastiflp or bloodhound
which in old time had saved his master by
his fidelity and which regularly followed him to
church bevis indeed fell under the proverb
which avers he is a good dog which goes to
church f for bating an occasional temptation to
warble along with the accord he behaved himself
as decorously as any the congregation and
returned as much edified perhaps as some 
them the damsels woodstock looked as
vainly for the laced cloaks jingling spurs slashed
boots and tall plumes the young cavaliers
 this and other highborn houses moving
through the streets and the churchyard with the
careless ease which indicates perhaps rather an
overweening degree selfconfidence yet shows
graceful when mingled with good humour and
courtesy the good old dames too in their
white hoods and black velvet gowns their daughters
 the cynosure neighbouring eyes 
where were they all now who when they entered
the church used to divide men's thoughts
between them and heaven but ah alice
lee so sweet so gentle so condescending in thy
woodstock

loveliness thus proceeds a contemporary annalist
whose manuscript we have deciphered
why is my story to turn upon thy fallen fortunes
 and why not rather to the period when
in the very dismounting from your palfrey you
attracted as many eyes as if an angel had descended
 as many blessings as if the benignant being
had come fraught with good tidings no
creature wert thou an idle romancers imagination
 no being fantastically bedizened with inconsistent
perfections thy merits made me love
thee well and for thy faults i think they made
me love thee better
with the house lee had disappeared from
the chantry king john others gentle blood
and honoured lineage freemantles winklecomes
drycotts c for the air that blew over
the towers oxford was unfavourable to the
growth puritanism which was more general
in the neighbouring counties there were among
the congregation however one or two that by
their habits and demeanour seemed country gentlemen
 consideration and there were also present
some the notables the town woodstock
cutlers or glovers chiefly whose skill in
 woodstock
steel or leather had raised them to a comfortable
livelihood these dignitaries wore long black
cloaks plaited close at the neck and like peaceful
citizens carried their bibles and membrane
at their girdles instead knife or
sword this respectable but least numerous
part the audience were such decent persons as
had adopted the presbyterian form faith renouncing
the liturgy and hierarchy the church
 england and using under the tuition the
rev nehemiah holdenough much famed for the
length and strength his powers predication
with these grave seniors sate their goodly dames
in ruff and gorget like the portraits which in
catalogues paintings are designed wife a
burghmaster and their pretty daughters whose
study like that chaucers physician was not
always in the bible but who were on the contrary
when a glance could escape the vigilance
 their honoured mothers inattentive themselves
and the cause inattention in others
but besides these dignified persons there
were in the church a numerous collection the
lower orders some brought thither by curiosity
but many them unwashed artificers bee

woodstock 
wintered in the theological discussions the
time and as many various sects as there are
colours in the rainbow the presumption 
these learned thebes being in exact proportion
to their ignorance the last was total and the first
boundless their behaviour in the church was
anything but reverential or edifying most 
them affected a cynical contempt for all that was
only held sacred by human sanction the church
was to these men but a steeplehouse the clergyy
man an ordinary person her ordinances dry
bran and sapless pottage unfitted for the spiritualized
palates the saints and the prayer an
address to heaven to which each acceded or not
as in his too critical judgment he conceived fit
the elder amongst them sate or lay on the
benches with their high steeplecrowned hats
pulled over their severe and knitted brows waiting
for the presbyterian parson as mastiffs sit
in dumb expectation the bull that is to be
brought to the stake the younger mixed some
 them a bolder licence manners with their
heresies they gazed round on the women yawned
coughed and whispered eat apples and cracked
woodstock
ed nuts as if in the gallery a theatre ere the
piece commences
besides all these the congregation contained
a few soldiers some in corslet and steel caps
some in buff and others in red coats these men
 war had their chandeliers with ammunition
slung round them and rested on their pikes and
muskets they too had their peculiar doctrines
on the most difficult points religion and united
the extravagances enthusiasm with the most
determined courage and resolution in the field
the burghers woodstock looked on these
military saints with no small degree awe for
though not often sullied with deeds plunder
or cruelty they had the power both absolutely
in their hands and the peaceful citizens had
no alternative save submission to whatever the
illregulated and enthusiastic imaginations their
martial guides might suggest
after some time spent in waiting for him mr
holdenough began to walk up the aisles the
chapel not with the slow and dignified carriage
with which the old rector was yore wont to
maintain the dignity the surplice but with a
woodstock 
hasty step like one who arrives too late at an appointment
and bustles forward to make the best
use his time he was a tall thin man with
an adust complexion and the vivacity his eye
indicated some irascibility temperament his
dress was brown not black and over his other
vestments he wore in honour calvin a geneva
cloak a blue colour which fell backward from
his shoulders as he posted on to the pulpit his
grizzled hair was cut as short as shears could perform
the feat and covered with a black silk skullcap
which stuck so close to his head that the two
ears expanded from under it as if they had been
intended as handles by which to lift the whole
person moreover the worthy divine wore spectacles
and a long grizzled peaked beard and he
carried in his hand a small pocketbible with silver
clasps upon arriving at the pulpit he
paused a moment to take breath then began to
ascend the steps by two at a time
but his course was arrested by a strong hand
which seized his cloak it was that one who
had detached himself from the group soldiery
he was a stout man middle stature with a
woodstock
quick eye and a countenance which though plain
had yet an expression that fixed the attention
his dress though not strictly military partook 
that character he wore large hose made 
calvesleather and a tuck as it was then called or
rapier tremendous length balanced on the
other side by a dagger the belt was morocco
garnished with pistols
the minister thus intercepted in his duty
faced round upon the party who had seized him
and demanded in no gentle tone the meaning 
the interruption
friend quoth the intruder is it thy purpose
to hold forth to these good people 
ay marry is it said the clergyman and
such is my bounden duty woe to me if i preach
not the gospel prithee friend let me not in my
labour
nay said the man warlike mien i am
myself minded to hold forth therefore do thou
desist or if thou wilt do by mine advice remain
and fructify with those poor goslings to whom i
am presently about to shake forth the crumbs 
comfortable doctrines
woodstock 
give place thou man satan said the
priest waxing wroth respect mine order my
cloth
i see no more to respect in the cut thy
cloak or in the cloth which it is fashioned
said the other than thou didst in the bishop's
rocket they were black and white thou art blue
and brown sleeping dogs every one you
lying down loving to slumber shepherds that
starve the flock but will not watch it each looking
to his own gain hum
scenes this indecent kind were so common
at the time that no one thought interfering
 the congregation looked on in silence the
better class scandalized and the lower orders
some laughing and others backing the soldier or
minister as their fancy dictated meantime the
struggle waxed fiercer mr holdenough clamoured
for assistance
mr mayor woodstock he exclaimed
wilt thou be among those wicked magistrates
who bear the sword in vain citizens will you
not help your pastor worthy aldermen will
you see me strangled on the pulpit stairs by this
 woodstock
man bufl'and belial but lo i will overcome
him and cast his cords from me
as holdenough spoke he struggled to ascend
the pulpit stairs holding hard on the bannisters
his tormentor held fast by the skirts the cloak
which went nigh to the choking the wearer
until as he spoke the words last mentioned
in a halfstrangled voice mr holdenough dexterously
slipped the string which tied it round
his neck so that the garment suddenly gave
way the soldier fell backwards down the steps
and the liberated divine skipped into his pulpit
and began to give forth a psalm triumph
over his prostrate adversary but a great hubbub
in the church marred his triumph and although
he and his faithful clerk continued to sing the
hymn victory their notes were only heard by
fits like the whistle a curled during a gale 
wind
the cause the tumult was as follows the
mayor was a zealous presbyterian and witnessed
the intrusion the soldier with great indignation
from the very beginning though he hesitated to
interfere with an armed man while on his legs and
woodstock 
capable resistance but no sooner did he behold
the champion independency sprawling on
his back with the diviners geneva cloak fluttering
in his hands than the magistrate rushed forward
exclaiming that such insolence was not to be
endured and ordered his constables to seize the
prostrate champion proclaiming in the magnanimity
 wrath i will commit every redcoat 
them all i will commit him were he noll cromwell
himself
the worthy mayor's indignation had overmastered
his reason when he made this mistimed
vaunt for three soldiers who had hitherto stood
motionless like statues made each a stride in
advance which placed them betwixt the municipal
officers and the soldier who was in the act 
arising then making at once the movement 
resting arms according to the manual as then practised
their musketbutts rang on the church pavement
within an inch the gouty toes master
mayor the energetic magistrate whose efforts
in favour order were thus checked cast one
glance on his supporters but that was enough to
show him that force was not on his side all
had shrunk back on hearing that ominous clatter
 woodstock
 stone and iron he was obliged to descend to
expostulation
what do you mean my masters said he 
is it like a decent and godfearing soldiery
who have wrought such things for the land as
have never before been heard to brawl and
riot in the church or to aid abet and comfort a
profane fellow who hath upon a solemn thanksgiving
excluded the minister from his own pulpits

we have nought to do with thy church as
thou call'st it said he who by a small feather
in front his morion appeared to be the corporal
 the party we see not why men gifts
should not be heard within these citadels superstition
as well as the voice the men crape
 old and the men cloak now wherefore
we will pluck yon jack presbyter out his
wooden sentinelbox and our own watchman shall
relieve the guard and mount thereon and cry
aloud and spare not
nay gentlemen said the mayor if such
be your purpose we have not the means to withstand
you being as you see peaceful and quiet
woodstock 
men but let me first speak with this worthy minister
nehemiah holdenough to persuade him
to yield up his place for the time without farther
scandal
the peacemaking mayor then interrupted
the quavering holdenough and the clerk and
prayed both to retire else there would he said
be certainly strife
 strife replied the presbyterian divine
with scorn no fear strife among men that
dare not testify against this open profanation 
the church and daring display heresy would
your neighbours banbury have brooked such
an insult 
come come mr holdenough said the
mayor put us not to mutiny and cry clubs
i tell you once more we are not men war or
blood
not more than may be drawn by the point
 a needle said the preacher scornfully ye
tailors woodstock for what is a glover buta
tailor working on kidskin i forsake you in
scorn your faint hearts and feeble hands and
will seek me elsewhere a flock which will not fly
vol i b
 woodstock
from their shepherd at the braying the first
wild ass which cometh from out the great deserts

so saying the aggrieved divine departed from
his pulpit and shaking the dust from his shoes
left the church as hastily as he had entered it
though for a different reason the citizens saw
his retreat with sorrow and not without a compunctious
feeling as if they were not playing the
most courageous part in the world the mayor
himself and several others left the church to follow
and appease him
the independent orator late prostrate was
now triumphant and inducting himself into the
pulpit without farther ceremony he pulled a
bible from his pocket and selected his text
from the fortyfifth psalm gird thy sword
upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory
and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperously
 upon this theme he commenced one
 those wild declamations common at the period
in which men were accustomed to wrest
and pervert the language scripture by adapting
it to modern events the language which
in its literal sense was applied to king david
woodstock 
and typically referred to the coming the
messiah was in the opinion the military
orator most properly to be interpreted oliver
cromwell the victorious general the infant
commonwealth which was never destined
to come age gird on thy sword exclaimed
the preacher emphatically and was not
that a pretty bit steel as ever dangled from a
corslet or rung against a steel saddle ay ye
prick up your ears now ye cutlers woodstock
as if ye should know something a good
fox broadsword did you forge it i trowel was
the steel quenched with water from rosamond's
well or the blade blessed by the old cuckolds
 godson you would have us think i
warrant me that you wrought it and welded
it grinned and polished it and all the while it
never came on a woodstock stithy you were
all too busy making whittles for the lazy crapemen
 oxford bouncing priests whose eyes
were so closed up with fat that they could not
see destruction till she had them by the throat
but t can tell you where the sword was forged
and tempered and welded and grinned and
 woodstock
polished when you were as i said before making
whittles for false priests and daggers for
dissolute g d d nme cavaliers to cut the people
 england's throat with it was forged at
long marston moor where blows went faster
than ever rung hammer on anvil and it was tempered
at naseby in the best blood the cavaliers
 and it was welded in ireland against the
walls drogheda and it was grinned on scottish
lives at dunbar and now late it was
polished in worcester till it shines as bright as
the sun in the middle heaven and there is no
light in england that shall come nigh unto it
here the military part the congregation raised
a hum approbation which being a sound
ike the hear hear the british house 
commons was calculated to heighten the enthusiasm
 the orator by intimating the sympathy
 the audience and then resumed the
preacher rising in energy as he found that his
audience partook in these feelings what sayeth
the text ride on prosperously do not stop 
do not call a halt do not quit the saddle pursue
the scattered fliers sound the trumpet not
woodstock j
a levant or a flourish but a point war sound
boot and saddle to horse and away a charge i
follow after the young man what part have
we in him slay take destroy divide the spoil 
blessed art thou oliver on account thine honour
 thy cause is clear thy call is undoubted
never has defeat come near thy leading staff nor
disaster attended thy banner ride on flower 
england's soldiers ride on chosen leader 
god's champions gird up the loins thy resolution
and be steadfast to the mark thy high
calling 
another deep and stern hum echoed by the
ancient elbowed arches the old chantry gave
him an opportunity an instant's repose when
the people woodstock heard him and not
without anxiety turn the stream his oratory
into another channel
but wherefore ye people woodstock
do i say these things to you who claim no portion
in our david no interest in england's son
 jesse you who were fighting as well as
your might could and it was not very formidable
for the late man under that old bloodthirsty pawoodstock

past sir jacob aston are you not now plotting
or ready to plot for restoring as ye call it the
young man the unclean son the slaughtered
tyrant the fugitive after whom the true hearts
 england are now following that they may
take and slay him why should your rider
turn his bridle our way say you in your hearts 
we will none him if we may help ourselves
we will rather turn us to wallow in the mire 
monarchy with the sow that was washed but new
lys come men woodstock i will ask and
do you answer me hunger ye still after the
fleshpots the monks godson and ye will
say nay but wherefore except that the pots
are cracked and broken and the fire is extinguished
wherewith thy oven used to boil and again
i ask drink ye still the well the fornications
 the fair rosamond eye will say nay but
wherefore 
here the orator ere he could answer the question
in his own way was surprised by the following
reply very pithily pronounced by one the
congregation because you and the like 
you have left us no brandy to mix with it
woodstock 
all eyes turned to the audacious speaker who
stood beside one the thick sturdy saxon pillars
which he himself somewhat resembled being
short stature but very strongly made a squat
broad littlejohn sort figure leaning on a
quarterstaff and wearing a jerkin which though
now sorely stained and discoloured had once been
 the lincoln green and showed remnants 
having been laced there was an air careless
goodhumoured audacity about the fellow and
though under military restraint there were some
 the citizens who could not help crying out
well said joceline johffe
jolly joceline call ye him proceeded the
preacher without showing either confusion or displeasure
at the interruption i will make him
joceline the jail if he interrupts me again
one your parkkeepers i warrant that can
never forget they have borne c r upon their
badges and buglehorns even as a dog bears his
owner's name on his collar a pretty emblem for
christian men but the brute beast hath the
better him the brute heareth his own coat
and the caitiff thrall wears his master's i have
 woodstock
seen such a wag make a rope's wag ere now
where was i oh rebuking you for your
backsliding men woodstock yes then
ye will say ye have renounced popery and ye have
renounced prelacy and then ye wipe your mouth
like pharisees as ye are and who but you for
purity religion but i tell you ye are but
like jehu the son nisi who broke down the
house baal yet departed not from the sons 
jeroboam even so ye eat not fish on friday with
the blinded papists nor mincedpies on the twen
tyfifth day december like the slothful relations
but ye will gorge on sack posset each
night in the year with your blind presbyterian
guide and ye will speak evil dignities and
revile the commonwealth and ye will glorify
yourselves in your park woodstock and say
was it not walled in first any other in england
and that by henry son william called 
the conqueror and ye have a princely lodge
therein and call the same a royal lodge and
ye have an oak which ye call the king's oak and
ye steal and eat the venison the park and ye
say this is the king's venison we will wash it
woodstock 
down with a cup to the king's health better we
eat it than those roundheaded commonwealth
knaves but listen unto me and take warning
for these things come we to controversy with
you and our name shall be a cannonshot
before which your lodge in the pleasantness
whereof ye take pastime shall be blown into
ruins and we will be as a wedge to split asunder
the king's oak into billets to heat a brown baker's
oven and we will spark your park and
slay your deer and eat them ourselves neither
shall you have any portion thereof whether
in neck or haunch ye shall not haft a tenpenny
knife with the horns thereof neither shall
ye cut a pair breeches out the hide for all
ye be cutlers and glovers and ye shall have
no comfort or support neither from the sequestrated
traitor henry lee who called himself ranger
 woodstock nor from any on his behalf
for they are coming hither who shall be called
mahershalalhashbaz because he maketh haste
to the spoil
here ended this wild effusion the latter part
 which fell heavy on the souls the poor citie
woodstock 
sens woodstock as tending to confirm a
report an unpleasing nature which had been
lately circulated the communication with london
was indeed slow and the news which it transmitted
were uncertain no less uncertain were the
times themselves and the rumours which were
circulated exaggerated by the hopes and fears
 so many various factions but the general
stream report so far as woodstock was concerned
had late run uniformly in one direction
day after day they had been informed that the
fatal fiat parliament had gone out for selling
the park woodstock destroying its lodge
dispersing its forest and crazing as far as they
could be crazed all traces its ancient fame
many the citizens were likely to be sufferers on
this occasion as several them enjoyed either
by sufferance or right various convenient privileges
 pasturage cutting fire wood and the like
in the royal chase and all the inhabitants the
little borough were hurt to think that the scenery
 the place was to be destroyed its edifices ruined
and its honours rent away this is a patriotic
sensation often found in such places which
woodstock 
ancient distinctions and longcherished recollect
tions former days render so different from
towns recent date the natives woodstock
felt it in the fullest force they had trembled at
the anticipated calamity but now when it was
announced by the appearance those dark stern
and at the same time omnipotent soldiers now
that they heard it proclaimed by the mouth 
one their military preachers they considered
their fate as inevitable the causes disagreement
among themselves were for the time forgotten
as the congregation dismissed without psalmody
or benediction went slowly and mournfully
homeward each to his own place abode
chapter 
come forth old man thy daughter's side
is now the fitting place for thee 
when time hath quelle the oak's bold pride
the youthful tendril yet may hide
the ruins the parent tree
when the sermon was ended the military
orator wiped his brow for notwithstanding the
coolness the weather he was heated with the
vehemence his speech and action he then descended
from the pulpit and spoke a word or two
to the corporal who commanded the party soldiers
who replying by a sober nod intelligence
drew his men together and marched them
in order to their quarters in the town
the preacher himself as if nothing extraordinary
had happened left the church and sauntered
through the streets woodstock with the
air a stranger who was viewing the town withwoodstock

out seeming to observe that he was himself in his
turn anxiously surveyed by the citizens whose
furtive yet frequent glances seemed to regard him
as something alike suspected and dreadful yet
on no account to be provoked he heeded them
not but stalked on in the manner affected by the
distinguished fanatics the day a stiff solemn
pace a severe and at the same time a contemplative
look like that a man incensed at the interruptions
which earthly objects forced upon
him obliging him by their intrusion to withdraw
his thoughts for an instant from celestial things
innocent pleasures what kind soever they held
in suspicion and contempt and innocent mirth
they abominated it was however a cast mind
that formed men for great and manly action as
it adopted principle and that an unselfish character
for the ruling motive instead the gratification
 passion some these men were indeed
hypocrites using the cloak religion only as a
covering for their ambition but many really possessed
the devotional character and the severe
republican virtue which others only affected by
far the greater number hovered between these
 woodstock
extremes felt to a certain extent the power 
religion and complied with the times in affecting
a great deal
the individual whose pretensions to sanctity
written as they were upon his brow and gait have
given rise to the above digression reached at
length the extremity the principal street
which terminates upon the park woodstock
a battlemented portal gothic appearance defended
the entrance to the avenue it was 
mixed architecture but on the whole though
composed the styles different ages when
it had received additions had a striking and
imposing effect an immense gate composed 
rails hammered iron with many a flourish and
scroll displaying as its uppermost ornament the
illfated cypher c r was now decayed partly
with rust partly from the effects violence
the stranger paused as if uncertain whether
he should demand or assay entrance he looked
through the grating down an avenue skirted by
majestic oaks which led onward with a gentle
curve as if into the depths some ample and ancient
forest the wicket the large iron gate being
woodstock 
left unwittingly open the soldier was tempted to
enter yet with some hesitation as he that intrudes
upon ground which he conjectures may be prohibited
 indeed his manner showed more reverence
for the scene than could have been expected
from his condition and character he slackened
his stately and consequential pace and at
length stood still and looked around him
not far from the gate he saw rising from the
trees one or two ancient and venerable turrets
bearing each its own vane rare device glittering
in the autumn sun these indicated the
ancient hunting seat or lodge as it was called
which had since the time henry been occasionally
the residence the english monarchs
when it pleased them to visit the woods oxford
which then so abounded with game that according
to old fuller huntsmen and falconers
were nowhere better pleased the situation which
the lodge occupied was a piece flat ground now
planted with sycamores not far from the entrance
to that magnificent spot where the spectator first
stops to gaze upon blenheim to think marls
woodstock
borough's victories and to applaud or criticise
the cumbrous magnificence hamburgh's style
there too paused our military preacher but
with other thoughts and for other purpose than
to admire the scene around him it was not long
afterwards when he beheld two persons a male
and a female approaching slowly and so deeply
engaged in their own conversation that they did
not raise their eyes to observe that there stood a
stranger in the path before them the soldier
took advantage their state abstraction and
desirous at once to watch their motions and avoid
their observation he glided beneath one the
huge trees which skirted the path and whose
boughs sweeping the ground on every side insured
him against discovery unless in case an
actual search
in the meantime the gentleman and lady continued
to advance directing their course to a rustic
seat which still enjoyed the sunbeams and
was placed adjacent to the tree where the stranger
was concealed
the man was elderly yet seemed bent more
woods took 
by sorrow and infirmity than by the weight 
years he wore a mourning cloak over a dress
 the same melancholy colour cut in that picturesque
form which vandyke has rendered immortal
but although the dress was handsome
it was put on and worn with a carelessness which
showed the mind the wearer ill at ease his
aged yet still handsome countenance had the
same air consequence which distinguished his
dress and his gait a striking part his appearance
was a long white beard which descended
far over the breast his slashed doublet and
looked singular from its contrast jn colour with
his habit
the young lady by whom this venerable gentleman
seemed to be in some degree supported
as they walked arm in arm was a slight and
sylphlike form with a person so delicately made
and so beautiful in countenance that it seemed
the earth on which she walked was too grossly massive
a support for a creature so aerial but mortal
beauty must share human sorrows the eyes 
the beautiful being showed tokens tears her
colour was heightened as she listened to her aged
vol i c 
 woodstock
companion and it was plain from his melancholy
yet displeased look that the conversation was as
distressing to himself as to her when they sate
down on the bench we have mentioned the gentleman's
discourse could be distinctly overheard
by the evesdropping soldier but the answers 
the young lady reached his ear rather less distinctly

it is not to be endured said the old man
passionately it would stir up a paralytic
wretch to start up a soldier my people have
been thinned i grant you or have fallen off
from me in these times i owe them no grudge
for it poor knaves what should they do when
the pantry has no bread and the buttery no ale 
but we have still about us some rugged foresters
 the old woodstock breed old as myself most
 them what that old wood seldom warps
in the wetting i will hold out the old house
and it will not be the first time that i have held
it against ten times the strength that we hear
 now immml
alas my dear father said the young
lady in a tone which seemed to intimate his proposal
 defence to be altogether desperate
woodstock 
and why alas said the gentleman angrily 
is it because i shut my door on a score or two
 these bloodthirsty hypocrites 
but their masters can as easily send a regiment
or an army if they wills replied the lady 
and what good would your present defence do
excepting to exasperate them to your utter destruction

be it so alice replied her father i have
lived my time and beyond it i have outlived
the kindest and most princelike masters
what do i do on the earth since the dismal
thirtieth january the parricide that day
was a signal to all true servants charles stuart
to avenge his death or die as soon after as they
could find a worthy opportunity
do not speak thus sir said alice lee 
it does not become your gravity and your
worth to throw away that life which may yet be
 service to your king and country it will not
and cannot always be thus england will not
long endure the rulers which these bad times
have assigned her in the meanwhile here
a few words escaped the listener's ears and
 woodstock
beware that impatience which makes bad
worse
worse exclaimed the impatient old man
what can be worse is it not at the worst already
 will not these people expel us from the
only shelter we have left dilapidate what remains
 royal property under my charge make the
palace princes into a den thieves and then
wipe their mouths and thank god as if they had
done an alms deed 
still said his daughter there is hope behind
and i trust the king is ere this out their
reach we have reason to think well my brow
ther albert's safety
ay albert there again said the old man
in a tone reproach had it not been for thy
entreaties i had gone to worcester myself but
i must needs lie here like a worthless hound
when the hunt is up when who knows what service
i might have shown an old man's head is
sometimes useful when his arm is but little worth
but you and albert were so desirous that he
should go alone and now who can say what has
become him 
woodstock 
 nay nay father said alice we have
good hope that albert escaped from that fatal
day young abney saw him a mile from the field
young abney lied i believe said the father
in the same humour contradiction 
 young abney's tongue seems quicker than his
hands but far slower than his horse's heels when
he leaves the roundheads behind him i would
rather albert's dead body were laid between
charles and cromwell than hear he fled as early
as young abney
my dearest father said the young lady
weeping as she spoke what can i say to comfort
you 
comfort me say'st thou girl i am sick 
comfort an honourable death with the ruins 
woodstock for my monument were the only
comfort to old henry lee yes by the memory
 my father i will make good the lodge against
these rebellious robbers
 yet be ruled dearest father said the maiden
 and submit to that which we cannot gainsay
my uncle everard 
here the old man caught at her unfinished
 woodstock
words thy uncle everard wench well get
on what thy precious and loving uncle
everard 
nothing sir she said if the subject displeases
you
 displeases me he replied why should it
displease me or if it did why should'st thou
or any one affect to care about it what is it
that hath happened late years what is it can
be thought to happen that astrologer can guess at
which can give pleasure to us 
fate she replied may have in store the
joyful restoration our banished prince
too late for my time alice said the knight
 if there be such a white page in the heavenly
 it will not be turned until long after my
day but i see thou wouldn't escape me in a
word what thy uncle everard 
nay sir said alice god knows i would
rather be silent for ever than speak what might
as you would take it add to your present distemperature

distemperature said her father oh thou
art a sweetlipped physician and would'st i warwoodstock
s
rant me drop nought but sweet balm and ho 
ney and oil on my distemperature if that is
the phrase for an old man's ailment when he is
well nigh heartbroken once more what thy
uncle everard 
his last words were uttered in a high and
peevish tone voice and alice lee answered
her father in a trembling and submissive tone
i only meant to say sir that i am well assured
that my uncle everard when we quit this
place 
that is to say when we are kicked out it
by cropeared canting villains like himself but
on with thy bountiful uncle what will he do 
will he give us the remains his worshipful
and economical housekeeping the fragments 
a thricesacked capon twice aweek and a plentiful
fast on the other aye days will he give us
beds beside his half starved nags and put them
under a short allowance straw that his sister's
husband that i should have called my deceased
angel by such a name and his sister's daughter
may not sleep on the stones or will he send usa
noble each with a warning to make it last for
 woodstock
he had never known the readypenny so hard to
come by or what else will your uncle everard
do for us get us a furlough to beg why i
can do that without him
 you misconstrue him much answered alice
with more spirit than she had hitherto displayed 
and would you but question your own heart
you would acknowledge i speak with reverence
that your tongue utters what your better judgment
would disown my uncle everard is neither
a miser nor a hypocrite neither so fond the
goods this world that he would not supply our
distresses amply nor so wedded to fanatical opinions
as to exclude charity for other sects beside
his own
 ay ay the church england is a sect
with him i doubt not and perhaps with thee too
alice said the knight what is a muggles
man or a ranter or a brownish but a sectary 
and thy phrase places them all with jack presbyter
himself on the same footing with our learned
prelates and religious clergy such is the cant
 the day thou livest in and why shouldst thou
not talk like one the wise virgins and psalmwoodstock

singing sisters since though thou hast a profane
old cavalier for a father thou art own niece to
uncle everard 
if you speak thus my dear fathers said
alice what can i answer you hear me but
one patient word and i shall have discharged my
uncle everard's commissions
oh it is a commission then surely i suspected
so much from the beginning nay have
some sharp guess touching the ambassador also
come madam do your errand and you shall
have no reason to complain my patience
then sir replied his daughter my uncle
everard desires you would be courteous to the
commissioners who come here to sequestrate the
parks and the property or at least heedfully to
abstain from giving them obstacle or opposition 
it can he says do no good even on your own
principles and it will give a pretext for proceeding
against you as one in the worst degree 
malignity which he thinks may otherwise be
prevented nay he has good hope that if you
follow his counsel the committee may through
the interest he possesses be inclined to remove the
 woodstock
sequestration your estate on a moderate fine
thus says my uncle and having communicated
his advice i have no occasion to urge your patience
with farther argument
it is well thou dost not alice answered sir
henry lee in a tone suppressed anger forby
the blessed rood thou hast well nigh led me
into the heresy thinking thee no daughter
 mine ah my beloved companion who art
now far from the sorrows and cares this weary
world could'st thou have thought that the daughter
thou didst clasp to thy bosom would like the
wicked wife job become a temptress to her father
in the hour affliction and recommend to
him to make his conscience truckle to his interest
and to beg back at the bloody hands his master's
and perhaps his son's murderers a wretched
remnant his property he has been robbed 
why wench if i must beg think'st thou i will
sue to those who have made me a mendicant na
i will never show my grey beard worn in sorrow
for my sovereign's death to move the compassion
 some proud sequestrator who perhaps was one
 the parricides no if henry lde must sue
woodstock 
for food it shall be some sound loyalist like
himself who having but half a loaf remaining will
not nevertheless refuse to share it with him for
his daughter she may wander her own way
which leads her to a refuge with her wealthy
roundhead kinsfolk but let her no more call
him father whose honest indigence she has refused
to share 
you do me injustice sir answered the
young lady with a voice animated yet faltering
 cruel injustice god knows your way is my
way though it lead to ruin and beggary and
while you tread it my arm shall support you while
you will accept an aid so feeble
 thou worst me girl answered the old
cavalier thou worst me as will shakspeare
says thou speaks lending me thy arm but
thy secret thought is thyself to hang upon markham
everard's
my father my father answered alice in a
tone deep grief what can thus have altered
your clear judgment and kindly heart accursed
be these civil commotions not only do they
destroy men's bodies but they pervert their souls
 woodstock
and the brave the noble the generous become
suspicious harsh and mean why upbraid me
with markham everard have i seen or spoke
with him since you discharged him my company
with terms less kind i will speak it truly than
was due even to the relationship betwixt you 
why think i would sacrifice to that young man
my duty to you know that were i capable 
such criminal weakness markham everard were
the first to despise me for it
she put her handkerchief to her eyes but she
could not hide her sobs nor conceal the distress
they intimated the old man was moved
i cannot tell he said what to think it
thou seem'st sincere and wert ever a good and
kindly daughter how thou hast let that rebel
youth creep into thy heart i wot not perhaps it
is a punishment on me who thought the loyalty 
my house was like undefiled ermine yet here
is a damned spot and on the fairest gem all 
my own dear alice but do not weep we have
enough to vex us where is it that shakspeare
hath it 
woodstock 
gentle daughter
give even way unto ray rough affairs 
put you not on the temper the times
nor be like them to percy troublesome 
i am glad to hear you quote your favourite
again sir our little jars are ever well nigh
ended when shakspeare comes in play
his was the closetcompanion my
blessed master said sir henry lee after the
bible with reverence for naming them together
he felt more comfort in it than any other and
as i have shared his disease why it is natural i
should take his medicine albeit i pretend not
to my master's art in explaining the dark passages
 for i am but a rude man and rustically
brought up to arms and hunting
you have seen shakspeare sir said the
yoimg lady
silly wench replied the knight he died
when i was a mere child thou hast heard me
say so twenty times but thou would'st lead the
old man away from the tender subject well
though i am not blind i can shut my eyes and
follow ben jonson i knew and could tell thee
many a tale our meetings at the mermaid
 woodstock
where if there was much wine there was much
wit also we did not sit blowing tobacco in
each other's faces and turning up the whites 
our eyes as we turned up the bottom the winepot
old ben adopted me as one his sons in
the muses i have shown you have i not the
verses to my much beloved son the worshipful
sir henry lee ditchley knight and baronet
 
i do not remember them at present sir replied
alice
i fear ye lie wench said her father but
no matter thou can'st not get any more fooling
out me just now the evil spirit hath left
saul for the present we are now to think what
is to be done about leaving woodstock or defending
it
my dearest father said alice can you
still nourish a moment's hope making good the
place r
i know not wench replied sir henry i
would fain have a parting blow at them tis certain
 and who knows where a blessing may alight 
but then my poor knaves that must take part
woodstock 
with me in so hopeless a quarrel that thought
hampers me i confesses
oh let it do so sir replied alice there
are soldiers in the town and there are three regiments
at oxford
ah poor oxford exclaimed sir henry
whose vacillating state mind was turned by
a word to any new subject that suggested itself
 seat learning and loyalty these rude
soldiers are unfit inmates for thy learned halls
and poetical bowers but thy pure and brilliant
lamp shall defy the foul breath a thousand
churls were they to blow at it like boreas the
burning bush shall not be consumed even by the
heat this persecution
true sir said alice and it may not be
useless to recollect that any stirring the royalists
at this unpropitious moment will make them
deal yet more harshly with the university which
they consider as being at the bottom everything
which moves for the king in these parts
 it is true wench replied the knight and
small cause would make the villains sequestrate
the poor remains which the civil wars have left to
 
 woodstock
the colleges that and the risk my poor fellows
 well thou hast disarmed me girl i
will be as patient and calm as a martyr
pray god you keep your word sir replied
his daughter but you are ever so much moved
at the sight any these men that 
 would you make a child me alice 
said sir henry why know you not that i
can look upon a viper or a toad or a bunch 
engendering adders without any worse feeling
than a little disgust and though a roundhead
and especially a redcoat are in my opinion more
poisonous than vipers more loathsome than toads
more hateful than knotted adders yet can i overcome
my nature so far that should one them
appear at this moment thyself should see how
civilly i would entreat him
as he spoke the military preacher abandoned
his leafy screen and stalking forward stood unexpectedly
before the old cavalier who stared at
him as if he had thought that his expressions had
actually raised a devil
who art thou at length said sir henry
in a raised and angry voice while his daughter
woodstock 
clung to this arm in terror little confident that
her father's pacific resolutions would abide the
shock this unwelcome apparition
i am ones replied the soldier who neither
fear nor shame to call myself a poor daylabourer
in the great work england humph ay a
simple and sincere upholder the good old
cause
 and what the devil do you seek here said
the old knight fiercely
the welcome due to the steward the lords
commissioners answered the soldier
welcome art thou as salt would be to sore
eyes said the cavalier but who be your commissioners
man 
the soldier with little courtesy held out a
scroll which sir henry took from him betwixt
his finger and thumb as if it were a letter from a
pesthouse and held it at as much distance from
his eyes as his purpose reading it would permit
he then read aloud and as he named the
parties one by one he added a short commentary
on each name addressed indeed to alice but in
vol i d
 woodstock
such a tone that showed he cared not for its being
heard by the soldier
desboroitgh the ploughman dosborough 
as grovelling a clown as is in england a fellow
that would be best at home like an ancient scythian
under the tilt a waggon d n him
harrison a bloodyminded ranting enthusiast
who read the bible to such purpose that he never
lacked a text to justify a murder d n him too
bletson a trueblue commonwealth's man one
 harrison's rota club with his noddle full 
newfangled notions about government the clearest
object which is to establish the tail upon
the head a fellow who leaves you the statutes
and laws old england to prate rome and
greece sees the areopagus in westminsterhall
and takes old noll for a roman consul 
add he is like to prove a dictator amongst
them instead never mind d n bletson too
friend said the soldier i would willingly
be civil but it consists not with my duty to
hear these godly men in whose service i am
spoken after this irreverent and unbecoming
fashion and albeit i know that you malignant
woodstock 
think you have a right to make free with that
damnation which you seem to use as your own
portion yet it is superfluous to invoke it against
others who have better hopes in their thoughts
and better words in their mouths
thou art but a canting varlet replied the
knight and yet thou art right in some sense 
for it is superfluous to curse men who already are
damned as black as the smoke hell itself
i prithee forbear continued the soldier
for manners sake if not for conscience grisly
oaths suit ill with gray beards
nay that is truth if the devil spoke it said
the knight and i thank heaven i can follow
good counsel though old nick gives it and so
friend touching these same commissioners bear
them this message that sir henry lee is keeper
 woodstock park with right waif and stray
vert and venison as complete as any them have
to their estate that is if they possess any estate
but what they have gained by plundering honest
men nevertheless he will give place to those
who have made their might their right and will
 woodstock
not expose the lives good and true men where
the odds are so much against them and he
protests that he makes this surrender neither as
acknowledging these so termed commissioners
nor as for his own individual part fearing their
force but purely to avoid the loss english
blood which so much hath been spilt in these
late times
it is well spoken said the steward the
commissioners and therefore i pray you let
us walk together into the house that thou may'st
deliver up unto me the vessels and gold and silver
ornaments belonging unto the egyptian pharaoh
who committed them to thy keeping
 what vessels exclaimed the fiery old
knight and belonging to whom unbaptized
dog speak civil the martyr in my presence
or i will do a deed misbecoming me on that
caitiff corpse thine and shaking his daughter
from his right arm the old man laid his hand
on his rapier
his antagonist on the contrary kept his temper
completely and waving his hand to add impression
woodstock s
to his speech he said with a calmness which aggravated
sir henry's wrath nay good friend
i prithee be still and brawl not sit becomes not
gray hairs and feeble arms to rail and rant like
drunkards put me not to use the carnal weapon
in mine own defence but listen to the voice 
reason see'st thou not that the lord hath decided
this great controversy in favour us and
ours against thee and thine wherefore render
up thy stewardship peacefully and deliver up tome
the chattels the man charles stuart
patience is a good nag but she will bolt
said the knight unable longer to rein in his wrath
he plucked his sheathed rapier from his side
struck the soldier a severe blow with it and instantly
drawing it and throwing the scabbard
over the trees placed himself in a posture defence
with his sword's point within half a yard 
the steward's body the latter stepped back with
activity threw his long cloak from his shoulders
and drawing his long tuck stood upon his guard
the swords clashed smartly together while alice
in her terror screamed wildly for assistance but
the combat was short duration the old 
woodstock
cavalier had attacked a man as cunning fence ashe
himself or a little more so and possessing all
the strength and activity which time had deprived
sir henry and the calmness which the
other had lost in his passion they had scarce
exchanged three passes ere the sword the
knight flew up in the air as if it had gone in
search the scabbard and burning with shame
and anger sir henry stood disarmed at the
mercy his antagonist the republican showed
no purpose abusing his victory nor did he
either during the combat or after the victory was
won in any respect alter the sour and grave composure
which reigned upon his countenance a
combat life and death seemed to him a thing
as familiar and as little to be feared as an ordinary
bout with foils
thou art delivered unto my hands he said
and by the law arms i might smite thee under
the fifth rib even as asahel was struck dead
by abner the son nun as he followed the
chase on the hill ammah that lieth before
giah in the way the wilderness gibeon 
but far be it from me to spill thy remaining drops
woodstock 
 blood true it is thou art the captive my
sword and my spear nevertheless seeing that
there may be a turning from thine evil ways and
a returning to those which are good if the lord
enlarge thy date for repentance and amendment
wherefore should it be shortened by a poor sinful
mortal who is speaking truly but thy fellowworm
p
sir henry lee remained still confused and unable
to answer when there arrived a fourth person
whom the cries alice had summoned to
the spot this was joceline joliffe one the
underkeepers the walk who seeing how matters
stood brandished his quarterstaff a weapon
from which he never parted and having made it
describe the figure eight in a flourish through
the air would have brought it down with a vengeance
upon the head the steward had not sir
henry interposed
we must trail bats now joceline our time
 shouldering them is passed it skills not striving
against the hill the devil rules the roast
and makes our slaves our tutors
at this moment another auxiliary rushed out
woodstock
 the thicket to the knights assistance it eras
the large wolfdog in strength a mastiff in form
and almost in fleetness a greyhound which we
have already mentioned bevis was the noblest 
the kind which ever pulled down a stag tawnycoloured
like a lion with a black muzzle and blackfeet
just edged with a line white round the
toes he was as tractable as he was strong and
bold just as he was about to rush upon the soldier
the words peace bevis v from sir henry
converted the lion into a lamb and instead 
pulling the soldier down he walked round and
round and snuffed as if using all his sagacity to
discover who the stranger could be towards
whom though so questionable an appearance
he was enjoined forbearance apparently he was
satisfied for he laid aside his doubtful and threatening
demonstrations lowered his ears smoothed
down his bristles and wagged his tail
sir henry who had great respect for the sagacity
 his favourite said in a low voice to alice
bevis is thy opinion and counsels submission
there is the finger heaven in this to
punish the pride ever the fault our house 
woodstock 
friend he continued addressing the soldier
thou hast given the finishing touch to a lesson
which ten years constant misfortune have been
unable fully to teach me thou hast distinctly
shown me the folly thinking that a good cause
can strengthen a weak arm god forgive me for
the thought but i could almost turn infidel and
believe that heaven's blessing goes ever with
the longest sword but it will not be always thus
god knows his time reach me my toledo jofeline
yonder it lies and the scabbard see where
it hangs on the tree do not pull at my cloak
alice and look so miserably frightened i shall
be in no hurry to betake me to bright steel again
i promise thee for thee good fellow i thank
thee and will make way for thy masters without
 farther dispute or ceremony joceline johffe is
nearer thy degree than i am and will make surrender
to thee the lodge and household stuff
withhold nothing joliffe let them have all
for me i will never crossthe threshold again 
but where to rest for a night i would trouble
no one in woodstock hum ay it shall be so
alice and i joceline will go down to thy hut by
s woodstock
rosamond's well we will borrow the shelter 
thy roof for one night at least thou wilt give us
welcome wilt thou not how now a clouded
brow 
joceline certainly looked embarrassed directed
first a glance to alice then looked to heaven
then to earth and last to the four quarters the
horizon and then murmured out certainly 
without question might he but run down to put
the house in order
order enough order enough for those that
may soon be glad clean straw in a barn said
the knight but if thou hast an ill will to harbour
any obnoxious or malignant persons as the
phrase goes never shame to speak it out man
tis true i took thee up when thou wert but a
ragged robin made a keeper thee and so forth
what that sailors think no longer the
wind than when it forwards them on the voyage
thy betters turn with the tide why should not
such a poor knave as thou 
god pardon your honour for your harsh
judgment said joliife the hut is yours such
as it is and should be were it a king's palace as
woodstock 
i wish it were even for your honour's sake and
mistress alice only i could wish your honour
would condescend to let me step down before incase
any neighbour be there or or just to put
matters something into order for mistress alice
and your honour just to make things something
seemly and shapely
not a whit necessary said the knight
while alice had much trouble in concealing her
agitation if thy matters are unseemly they are
fitter for a defeated knight if they are unshapely
why the liker to the rest a world which is
all shaped go thou with that man what is
thy name friend 
joseph tomkins is my name in the flesh
said the steward men call me honest joe
and trusty tomkins
if thou hast deserved such names considering
what trade thou hast driven thou art a jewel
indeed said the knight yet if thou hast not
never blush for the matter joseph for if thou
art not in truth honest thou hast all the better
chance to keep the fame it the title and the
go woodstock
thing itself have long walked separate ways farewell
to thee and farewell to fair woodstock 
so saying the old knight turned round and
pulling his daughter's arm through his own they
walked onward into the forest in the same posture
in which they were introduced to the reader
woodstock
chapter iii
now ye wild blades that make loose inns your stage
to vapour forth the aces this sad age
stout edgehill fight the wherries and the west
and northern clashes where you still fought best 
your strange escapes your dangers void fear
when bullets flew between the head and ear
whether you fought by damme or the spirit
 you i speak
legend captain jones
joseph tomkins and joliffe the keeper remained
for some time in silence as they stood
together looking along the path in which the
figures the knight ditchley and pretty
mistress ace had disappeared behind the trees
they then gazed on each other in doubt as
men who scarce knew whether they stood on hostile
or on friendly terms together and were at
a loss how to open a conversation they heard
the knight's whistle summon bevis but though
the good hound turned his head and pricked his
cars at the sound yet he did not obey the call
 woodstock
but continued to snuff around joseph tomkinss
cloak
thou art a rare one i fear me said the
keeper looking to his new acquaintance i
have heard men who have charms to steal
both dogs and deer
trouble thyself not about my qualities
friend said joseph tomkins but bethink
thee doing thy master's bidding
joceline did not immediately answer but at
length as if in sign truce stuck the his
quarterstaff upright in the ground and leant
upon it as he said gruffly so ray tough old
knight and you were at drawn bilbo by way 
afternoon service sir preacher well for you i
came not up till the blades were done jingling
or i had rung evensong upon your pate
the independent smiled grimly as he replied
nay friend it is well for thyself for never
should sexton have been better paid for the
knell he tolled nevertheless why should there
be war betwixt us or my hand be against thine 
thou art but a poor knave doing thy master's
order nor have i any desire that my own blood
or thine should be shed touching this matter
woodstock 
thou art i understand to give me peaceful possession
 the palace woodstock so called 
though there is now no palace in england no nor
shall be in the days that come after until we shall
enter the palace the new jerusalem and the
reign the saints shall commence on earths
pretty well begun already friend tompkins
said the keeper you are little short being
kings already upon the matter as it now stands 
and for your jerusalem i wot not but woodstock
is a pretty nestegg to begin with well will
you show will you on will you take sasine and
livery you heard my orders
humph i know not said tomkins i
must beware ambuscades and i am alone
here moreover it is the high thanksgiving
appointed by parliament and owned to by the
army also the old man and the young woman
may want to recover some their clothes and
personal property and i would not that they
were baulked on my account wherefore if
thou wilt deliver me possession tomorrow morning
it shall be done in personal presence my
own followers and the presbyterian man the
mayor so that the transfer may be made before
 woodstock
witnesses whereas were there none with us but
thou to deliver and i to take possession the men
 belial might say go to trusty tomkins hath
been an edomite honest joe hath been as an
ishmaelite rising up early and dividing the spoil
with them that served the man yea they that
wore beards and green jerkins as in remembrance
 the man and his governments
joceline fixed his keen dark eyes upon the
soldier as he spoke as if in design to discover
whether there was fair play in his mind or not
he then applied his five fingers to scratch a large
shock head hair as if that operation was
necessary to enable hit to come to a conclusion
this is all fair sounding brother said he but
i tell you plainly there are some silver mugs and
platters and flagons and so forth in yonder house
which have survived the general sweep that sent
all our plate to the smeltingpot to put our knight's
troop on horseback now if thou takes not these
off my hand i may come to trouble since it maybe
thought i have finished their numbers 
whereas i being as honest a fellow 
as ever stole venison said tomkins nay
i do owe thee an interruption
woodstock
go to then replied the keeper if a stag
may have come to mischance in my walk it was
no way in the course dishonesty but merely
to keep my old dame's pan from rusting but
for silver porringers tankards and such like i
would as soon have drunk the melted silver as
stolen the vessel made out it so that i would
not wish blame or suspicion fell on me in this
matter and therefore if you will have the
things rendered even now why so and if not
hold me blameless
ay truly said tomkins and who is to
hold me blameless if they should see cause to
think anything finished not the right worshipful
commissioners to whom the property the
estate is as their own therefore as thou say'st
we must walk warily in the matter to lock up
the house and leave it were but the work 
simple ones what mayest thou to spend the
night there and then nothing can be touched
without the knowledge us both 
why concerning that answered the keeper
 i should be at my hut to make matter
vol i e
 woodstock
somewhat conformable for him and mistress
alice for my old dame joan is something
dunny and will scarce know how to manage 
and yet to speak truth by the mass i would
rather not see sir henry tonight since what has
lapped today hath roused his spleen and it is
a pera venture he may have met something at
the hut which will scarce tend to cool it
it is a pity said tomkins that being a
gentleman such grave and goodly presence
he should be such a malignant cavalier and that
he should like the rest that generation 
vipers have clothed himself with curses as with
a garment
 which is as much as to say the tough old
knight hath a habit swearing said the keeper
grinning at a pun which has been repeated
since his time but who can help it it comes
 use and wont were you now in your bodily
self to light suddenly on a maypole with all
the blithe morrisdancers prancing around it to
the merry pipe and tabor with bells jingling
ribbons fluttering lads frisking and laughing
woodstock g
lasses leaping till you might see where the scarlet
garter fastened the lightblue hose i think some
feeling resembling either natural sociality or
old use and wont would get the better friend
even thy gravity and thou wouldst fling thy
cuckolds steeplehat one way and that bloodthirsty
longsword another and trip like the
noodles hogsnorton when the pigs play on
the organ
the independent turned fiercely round on the
keeper and replied how now mr green jerkin
 what language is this to one whose hand
is at the plough i advise thee to put curb on
thy tongue lest thy ribs pay the forfeit
nay do not take the high tone with me
brother answered joceline remember thou
hast not the old knight sixtyfive to deal with
but a fellow as bitter and prompt as thyself
it may be a little more so younger at all events
and prithee why shouldst thou take such umbrage
at a maypole i would thou hadst known
one phil hazeldine these parts he was the
best morrisdancer betwixt oxford and bedford
 woodstock
the more shame to him answered the independent
 and i trust he has seen the error
 his ways and made himself as if a man 
action he easily might fit for better company
than woodhunters deerstealers maid marion
swashbucklers deposed revellers bloody brawlers
maskers and mummers lewd men and light
women fools and fiddlers and carnal selfpleases
 every description
well replied the keeper you are out 
breath in time for here we stand before the famous
maypole woodstock
they paused in an open space meadowland
beautifully skirted by large oaks and sycamores
one which as king the forest stood a little
detached from the rest as if scorning the vicinity
 any rival it was scathed and gnarled
in the branches but the immense trunk still
showed to what gigantic size the monarch the
forest can attain in the groves merry england
that is called the king's oak said joce
line the oldest men woodstock know not
how old it is they say henry used to sit under
woodstock 
it with fair rosamond and see the lasses dance
and the lads the village run races and wrestle
for belts or bonnets
i nothing doubt it friend said tomkins 
a tyrant and a harlot were fitting patron and
patroness for such vanities
thou may'st say thy say friend replied
the keeper so thou hottest me say mine there
stands the maypole as thou seest half a flightshot
from the king's oak in the midst the
meadow the king gave ten shillings from the
customs woodstock to make a new one yearly
besides a tree fitted for the purpose out the
forest now it is warped and withered and twisted
like a wasted briarrod the green too used
to be closeshaved and rolled till it was smooth
as a velvet mantle now it is rough and overgrown

well well friend joceline said the independent
 but where was the edification all
this what use doctrine could be derived
from a pipe and tabor or was there ever aught
like wisdom in a bagpipe 
 woodstock
 you may ask better scholars that said
joceline but methinks men cannot be always
grave and with the hat over their brow a young
maiden will laugh as a tender flower will blow 
ay and a lad will ike her the better for it just
as the same blithe spring that makes the young
birds whistle bids the blithe fawns skip there
have come worse days since the jolly old times
have gone by i tell thee that in the holidays
which you mr longford have put down i
have seen this greensward alive with merry maidens
and manly fellows the good old rector himself
thought it was no sin to come for a while
and look on and his goodly cassock and scarf
kept us all in good order and taught us to limit
our mirth within the bounds discretion we
might it may be crack a broad jest or pledge
a friendly cup a turn too often but it was in
mirth and good neighbourhood ay and if there
was a bout at singlestick or a bellyful boxing
it was all for love and kindness and better
a few dry blows in drink than the bloody doings
we have had in sober earnest since the presby
woodstock 
ter's cap got above the bishop's mitre and we
exchanged our goodly rectors and learned doctors
whose sermons were all bolstered up with
as much greek and latin as might have confounded
the devil himself for weavers and cobblers
and such other pulpit volunteers as as
we heard this morning it will out
well friend said the independent with
patience scarce to have been expected i quarrel
not with thee for nauseating my doctrine if
thine ear is so much tickled with tabor tunes and
morris tripping truly it is not likely thou should'st
find pleasant savour in more wholesome and sober
food but let us to the lodge that we may go
about our business there before the sun sets
 troth and that may be advisable for more
reasons than one said the keeper for there
have been tales about the lodge which have made
men afeard to harbour there after nightfall
were not yon old knight and yonder damsel
his daughter wont to dwell there said the
independent my information said so
ay truly did they said eocene and
 woodstock
when they kept a jolly household all went well
enough for nothing banishes fear uke good ale
but after the best our men went to the wars
and were slain at naseby flight they who were
left found the lodge more lonesome and the old
knight has been much deserted his servants 
marry it might be that he has lacked silver
 late to pay groom and lackey
 a potential reason for the diminution a
household said the soldier
right sir even so replied the keeper
they spoke steps in the great gallery heard
by dead the night and voices that whispered
at noon in the matted chambers and the servants
pretended that these things scared them
away but in my poor judgment when martinmas
and whitsuntide came round without a 
the old bluebottles servingmen began
to think creeping elsewhere before the frost
chilled them no devil so frightful as that which
dances in the pocket where there is no cross to
keep him out
you were reduced then to a petty household
 said the independent
woodstock 
ay marry were we said joceline but
we kept some halfscore together what with bluebottles
in the lodge what with green caterpillars
 the chase like him who is yours to command
 we stuck together till we found a call to
take a morning's ride somewhere or other
 to the town worcester said the soldier
where you were crushed like vermin and palmer
worms as you are
you may say your pleasure replied the
keeper i'll never contradict a man who has
got my head under his belt our backs are at
the wall or you would not be here
nay friend said the independent thou
rises nothing by thy freedom and trust in me
i can be hon camarado to a good soldier although
i have striven with him even to the going down 
the sun but here we are in front the lodge
they stood accordingly in front the old
gothic building irregularly constructed and at
different times as the humour the english
monarchs led them to taste the pleasures woodstock
chase and to make such improvements for
ff woodstock
their own accommodation as the increasing luxury
 each age required the oldest part the
structure had been named by tradition fair rosamond's
tower it was a small turret great
height with narrow windows and walls massive
thickness the tower had no opening to
the ground or means descending a great part
 the lower portion being solid masonwork it
was traditionally said to have been accessible only
by a sort small drawbridge which might be
dropped at pleasure from a little portal near the
summit the turret to the battlements another
tower the same construction but twenty feet
lower and containing only a winding staircase
called in woodstock love's ladder because it
is said that by ascending this staircase to the
top the tower and then making use the
drawbridge henry obtained access to the chamber
 his paramour
this tradition had been keenly impugned by
dr rochecliffe the former rector woodstock
who insisted that what was called rosamond's
tower was merely an interior keep or citadel to
woodstock 
which the lord or warden the castle might retreat
when other points safety failed him and
either protract his defence or at the worst stipulate
for reasonable terms surrender the people
 woodstock jealous their ancient traditions
did not relish this new mode explaining
them away and it is even said that the mayor
whom we have already introduced became presbyterian
in revenge the doubts cast by the
rector upon this important subject rather choosing
to give up the liturgy than his fixed belief
in rosamond's tower and love's ladder
the rest the lodge was considerable extent
and different ages comprehending a nest
 little courts surrounded by buildings which
corresponded with each other sometimes withindoors
sometimes by crossing the courts and frequently
in both ways the different heights 
the building announced that they could only be
connected by the usual variety staircases which
exercised the limbs our ancestors in the sixteenth
and earlier centuries and seem sometimes
to have been contrived for no other purpose
 woodstock
the varied and multiplied fronts this irregular
building were as dr rochecliffe was wont to
say an absolute banquet to the architectural antiquary
as they certainly contained specimens 
every style which existed from the pure norman
 henry anjou down to the composite half
gothic half classical architecture elizabeth
and her successor accordingly the rector was
himself as much enamoured woodstock as
ever was henry fair rosamond and as his
intimacy with sir henry lee permitted him entrance
at all times to the royal lodge he used
to spend whole days in wandering about the antique
apartments examining measuring studying
and finding out excellent reasons for architectural
peculiarities which probably only owed
their existence to the freakish fancy a gothic
artist but the old antiquarian had been expelled
from his living by the intolerance and troubles
 the times and his successor nehemiah holdenough
would have considered an elaborate investigation
 the profane sculpture and architecture
 blinded and bloodthirsty papists togewoodstock

ther with the history the dissolute amours 
old norman monarchs as httle better than a
bowing down before the calves bethel and a
drinking the cup abominations we return
to the course our story
there is said the independent tomkins
after he had carefully perused the front the
building many a rare monument olden
wickedness about this miscalled royal lodge 
verily i shall rejoice much to see the same destroyed
yea burned to ashes and the ashes
thrown into the brook kedron or any other
brook that the land may be cleansed from the
memory thereof neither remember the iniquity
with which their fathers have sinned
the keeper heard him with secret indignation
and began to consider with himself whether as
they stood but one to one and without chance 
speedy interference he was not called upon by
his official duty to castigate the rebel who used
language so defamatory but he fortunately recollected
that the strife must be a doubtful one
that the advantage arms was against him 
to woodstock
and that in especial even if he should succeed
in the combat it would be at the risk severe
retaliation it must be owned too that there
was something about the independent so dark
and mysterious so grim and grave that the more
open spirit the keeper felt oppressed and if
not overawed at least kept in doubt concerning
him and he thought it wisest as well as safest
for his master and himself to avoid all subjects
 dispute and know better with whom he was
dealing before he made either friend or enemy
 him
the great gate the lodge was strongly bolted
but the wicket opened on joceline's raising
the latch there was a short passage ten feet
which had been formerly closed by a portcullis
at the inner while three loopholes opened on
either side through which any daring intruder
might be annoyed who having surprised the
first gate must be thus exposed to a severe fire
before he could force the second but the machinery
 the portcullis was damaged and it
now remained a fixture brandishing its jaw well
woodstock 
furnished with iron fangs but incapable dropping
it across the path invasion
the way therefore lay open to the great
hall or outer vestibule the lodge one 
 this long and dusky apartment was entirely
occupied by a gallery which had in ancient times
served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels
there was a clumsy staircase at either side
 it composed entire logs a foot square 
and in each angle the ascent was placed byway
 sentinel the figure a norman footsoldier
having an open casque on his head which
displayed features as stern as the painter's genius
could devise their arms were buffjackets or
shirts mail round bucklers with spikes in the
centre and buskins which adorned and defended
the feet and ancles but left the knees bare these
wooden warders held great swords or maces in
their hands like military guards on duty many
an empty hook and brace along the walls the
gloomy apartment marked the spots from which
arms long preserved as trophies had been in the
pressure the war once more taken down to do
u
 woodstock
service in the field like veterans whom extremity
 danger recalls to battle on other rusty
fastenings were still displayed the hunting trophies
 the monarchs to whom the lodge belonged
and the sylvan knights to whose care
it had been from time to time confided
at the nether the hall a huge heavy
stonewrought chimneypiece projected itself ten
feet from the wall adorned with many a cypher
and many a scutcheon the royal house 
england in its present state it yawned like the
arched mouth a funeral vault or perhaps
might be compared to the crater an extinguished
volcano but the sable complexion 
the massive stonework and all around it showed
that the time had been when it sent its huge fires
blazing up the huge chimney besides puffing
many a volume smoke over the heads the
jovial guests whose royalty or nobility did not
render them sensitive enough to quarrel with
such slight inconvenience on these occasions it
was the tradition the house that two cartloads
 wood was the regular allowance for the fire
woodstock 
between noon and curfew and the andirons or
dogs as they were termed constructed for retaining
the blazing fire wood on the hearth were
wrought in the shape lions such gigantic size
might well warrant the legend there were long
seats stone within the chimney where in despite
 the tremendous heat monarchs were sometimes
said to have taken their station and amused themselves
with broiling the tumbles or dowsets the
deer upon the glowing embers with their own
royal hands tradition was here also ready with
her record to show what merry gibes such as
might be exchanged between prince and peer
had flown about at the merry banquet which
followed the michaelmas hunt she could tell
too exactly where king stephen sat when he
darned his own princely hose and the odd
tricks he had put upon little winking the tailor
 woodstock
most this rude revelry belonged to the plantagenet
times when the house tudor acceded
to the throne they were more chary their royal
presence and feasted in halls and chambers far
vol i f
 woodstock
within abandoning the outmost hall to the yeomen
 the guard who mounted their watch there
and passed away the night with wassail and mirth
exchanged sometimes for frightful tales apparitions
and sorceries which made some those
grow pale in whose ears the trumpet a french
foeman would have sounded as jollily as a summons
to the woodland chase
joceline pointed out the peculiarities the
place to his gloomy companion more briefly than
we have detailed them to the reader the independent
seemed to listen with some interest at
first but flinging it suddenly aside he said ina
solemn tone perish babylon as thy master
nebuchadnezzar hath perished he is a wanderer
and thou shalt be a waste place yea and a
wilderness yea a desert salt in which there
shall be thirst and famines
 there is like to be enough both tbnights
said joceline unless the good knights larder
be somewhat fuller than it is wont
 we must care for the creaturecomforts
said the independent but in due season when
woodstock 
our duties are done whither lead these entrances


that to the right replied the keeper leads
to what are called the stateapartments not used
since the year sixteen hundred and thirtynine
when his blessed majesty 
how sir interrupted the independent ina
voice thunder doest thou speak charles
stuart as blessing or blessed beware the proclamation
to that effect
i meant no harm answered the keeper
suppressing his disposition to make a harsher reply
 my business is with bolts and bucks not
with titles and state affairs but yet whatever
may have lapped since that poor king was followed
with blessings enough from woodstock
for he left a glove full broad pieces for the
poor the place 
peace friend said the independent i
will think thee else one those besotted and
blinded papists who hold that bestowing alms
is an atonement and washing away the wrongs
and oppressions which have been wrought by
 woodstock 
the almsgiver thou mayest then these were the
apartments charles stuart 
and his father james before him and
elizabeth before him and bluff king henry
who builded that wing before them all
and there i suppose the knight and his
daughter dwelt 
no replied joceline sir henry lee
had too much reverence for for things which
are now thought worth no reverence at all besides
the staterooms are unaired and in indifferent
order since hate years the knight ranger's
apartment lies by that passage to the left
and whither goes yonder stair which seems
both to lead upwards and downwards 
upwards replied the keeper it leads to
many apartments used for various purposes 
sleeping and other accommodation downwards
to the kitchen offices and vaults the castle
which at this time the evening you cannot
see without lights
we will to the apartments your knight
thence said the independent is there fitting
accommodation there 
woodstock s
such as has served a person condition
whose lodging is now worse appointed answered
the honest keeper his bile rising so fast that he
added in a muttering and inaudible tone so it
may well serve a cropeared knave like thee
he acted as the usher however and led on
towards the ranger's apartments
this suite opened by a short passage from the
hall secured at time need by two oaken doors
which could be fastened by large bars the same
that were drawn out the wall and entered
into square holes contrived for their reception
on the other side the portal at the 
this passage a small anteroom received them
into which opened the sittingapartment the
good knight which in the style the times
might have been termed a fair summer parlour 
lighted by two oriel windows so placed as to command
each them a separate avenue leading
distant and deep down into the forest the principal
ornament the apartment besides two or
three family portraits less interest was a tall
fulllength picture which hung above the chime
which like that in the hall was 
 woodstock
heavy stonework ornamented with carved scutcheons
emblazoned with various devices the
portrait was that a man about fifty years 
age in complete plate armour and painted in
the harsh and dry manner holbein probably
indeed the work that artist as the dates corresponded
the formal and marked angles
points and projections the armour were a
good subject for the harsh pencil that early
school the face the knight was from the
fading the colours pale and dim like that 
some being from the other world yet the lines
expressed forcibly pride and exultation he
pointed with his leadingstaff or truncheon to the
background where in such perspective as the
artist possessed were depicted the remains a
burning church or monastery and four or five
soldiers in red cassocks bearing away in triumph
what seemed a brazen font or laver above their
heads might be traced in scroll lee victor sic
voluit right opposite to the picture hung ina
niche in the wall a complete set tilting armour
the black and gold colours and ornaments
woodstock 
 which exactly corresponded with those exhibited
in the portrait
the picture was one those which from
something marked in the features and expression
attract the observation even those who
are ignorant art the independent looked
at it until a smile passed transiently over his
clouded brow whether he smiled to see the
grim old cavalier employed in desecrating a religious
house an occupation much conforming
to the practice his own sect whether he smiled
in contempt the old painter's harsh and
dry mode working or whether the sight 
this remarkable portrait revived some other ideas
the underkeeper could not decide
the smile passed away in an instant as the
soldier looked to the oriel windows the recesses
within them were raised a step or two from the
wall in one was placed a walnuttree readingdesk
and a huge stuffed armchair covered with
spanish leather a little cabinet stood beside
with some its shuttles and drawers open displaying
hawksbells dogwhistles instruments for
trimming a falcon's feathers bridlebits various
 woodstock
constructions and other trifles connected with
sylvan sport
the other little recess was differently furnished
there lay some articles needlework on a
small table besides a lute with a having
some airs pricked down in it and a frame for
working embroidery some tapestry was displayed
around the recess with more attention to ornament
than was visible in the rest the apartment 
the arrangement a few bowpots with such
flowers as the fading season afforded showed
also the superintendence female taste
tomkins cast an eye careless regard upon
these subjects female occupation then stepped
into the farther window and began to turn the
leaves a folio which lay open on the readingdesk
apparently with some interest joceline
who had determined to watch his motions without
interfering with them was standing at some
distance in dejected silence when a door behind
the tapestry suddenly opened and a pretty village
maid tripped out with a napkin in her hand
as if she had been about some household duty
how now sir impudence she said to
woodstock 
joceline in a smart tone what do you here
prowling about the apartments when the master
is not at home 
but instead the answer which perhaps she
expected joceline joliffe cast a mournful glance
towards the soldier in the oriel window as if to
make what he said fully intelligible and replied
with a dejected appearance and voice alack
my pretty phoebe there come those here that
have more right or might than any us and
will use little ceremony in coming when they will
and staying while they please
he darted another glance at tom king who
still seemed busy with the before him then
sidled close to the astonished girl who had continued
looking alternately at the keeper and at
the stranger as if she had been unable to understand
the words the first or to comprehend
the meaning the second being present
 go whispered joliffe approaching his
mouth so near her cheek that his breath waved
the curls her hair go my dearest phoebe
trip it as fast as a fawn down to my lodge i
will soon be there and
 woodstock
your lodge indeed said phoebe you are
very bold for a poor killbuck that never frightened
anything before save a dun deer your
lodge indeed i am like to go there i think
hush hush phoebe there is no time for
jesting down to my hut i say like a deer for
the knight and mrs alice are both there and i
fear will not return hither again all's naught
girl and our evil days are come at last with a
vengeance we are fairly at bay and fairly hunted
down
can this be joceline said the poor girl
turning to the keeper with an expression 
fright in her countenance which she had hitherto
averted in rural coquetry
as sure my dearest phoebe as 
the rest the asseveration was lost in phcebes
ear so closely did the keeper's lips approach it 
and if they approached so very near as to touch
her cheek grief like impatience hath its privileges
and poor phoebe had enough serious
alarm to prevent her from demurring upon such
a trifle
but no trifle was the approach joceline's
woodstock 
lips to phoebe's pretty though sunburnt cheek
in the estimation the independent who a utthe
before the object joceliiie's vigilance had
been in his turn the observer the keeper's
demeanour so soon as the interview betwixt
phoebe and him had become so interesting and
when he remarked the closeness joceline's argument
he raised his voice to a pitch harshness
that would have rivalled that a saw and
which at once made joceline and phoebe spring
six feet apart each in contrary directions and
if cupid was the party must have sent him
out at the window like a wildduck flying from
a culverin instantly throwing himself into the
attitude a preacher and a reprover vice
how now he exclaimed shameless and
impudent as you are what chambering and
wantoning in our very presence how would
you play your pranks before the steward the
commissioners the high court parliament
as ye would in a booth at the fulsome fair or
amidst the trappings and tracings a profane
dancingschool where the scoundrel minstrels
make their ungodly weapons to squeak kiss
 woodstock
and be kind the fiddler's blind fbut here
he said dealing a perilous thump upon the
volume here is the king and high priest 
those vices and follies here is he whom men
 folly profanely call nature's miracle here is
he whom princes chose for their cabinetkeeper
and whom maids honour take for their bedfellow
 here is the prime teacher fine words
foppery and folly here dealing another
thump upon the volume and oh revered the
roxburgh it was the first folio beloved the
bannatyne it was hemmings and rondel it
was the edition princeps on thee he continued
 on thee william shakspeare i charge
whatever such lawless idleness and immodest
folly hath defiled the land since thy day 
by the mass a heavy accusation said joce
line the bold recklessness whose temper could
not be long overawed odds pitlikins is our
master's old favourite will stratford to answer
for every buss that has been snatched since
james's time a perilous reckoning truly but
i wonder who is possible for what lads and lasses
did before his day 
woodstock 
scoff not said the soldier lest i being
called thereto by the voice within me do deal
with thee as a scorner verily i say that since
the devil fell from heaven he never wanted
agents on earth yet nowhere hath he met with
a wizard having such infinite power over men's
souls as this pestilent fellow shakspeare seeks
a wife a foul example for adultery here she shall
find it would a man know how to train his
fellow to be a murderer here shall he find tutoring
 would a lady marry a heathen negro
she shall have chronicled example for it would
any one scorn at his maker he shall be furnished
with a jest in this would he defy his brother
in the flesh he shall be accommodated with
a challenge would you be drunk shakspeare
will cheer you with a cup would you plunge in
sensual pleasures he will soothe you to indulgence
as with the lascivious sounds a lute
this i say this is the wellhead and source
 all those evils which have overrun the land like
a torrent making men scoffers doubters deniers
murderers makebates and lovers the winepot
haunting unclean places and sitting long at
 woodstock
the eveningwine away with him away with
him men england to tophet with his wicked
 and to the vale hinnom with his accursed
bones verily but that our march was
hasty when we passed stratford in the year s
with sir william waller but that our march
was hasty 
 because prince rupert was after you with
his cavaliers muttered the incorrigible joce
line
i say continued the zealous trooper raising
his voice and extending his arm but that our
march was by command hasty and that we turned
not aside in our riding closing our ranks each
one upon the other as becomes men war i
bad torn on that day the bones that preceptor
 vice and debauchery from the grave and given
them to the next dunghill i would have made
his memory a scoff and a hissing 
that is the bitterest thing he has said yet
observed the keeper poor will would have
liked the hissing worse than all the rest
will the gentleman say any more inquired
phoebe in a whisper lackaday he talks
woodstock 
brave words if one knew but what they meant
but it is a mercy our good knight did not see him
ruffle the at that rate mercy on us there
would certainly have been bloodshed but oh
the father see how he is twisting his face about 
is he ill the colic think'st thou joceline 
or may i offer him a glass strong waters 
 hark thee hither wench f said the keeper
he is but loading his blunderbuss for another
volley and while he turns up his eyes and
twists about his face and clenches his fist and
shuffles and tramples with his feet in that fashion
he is bound to take no notice anything i
would be sworn to cut his purse if he had one
from his side without his feeling it
la joceline said phoebe and if he abides
here in this turn times i dare say the gentleman
will be easily served
care not thou about that said joliffe 
 but tell me softly and hastily what is in the
pantry 
small housekeeping enough said phoebe
 a cold capon and some comfits and the great
standing venison pasty with plenty spice a
manchet or two besides and that is all
 woodstock
well it will serve for a pinchwrap thy
cloak round thy comely body get a basket and
a brace trenchers and towels they are heinously
impoverished down yonder carry down the
capon and the marches the pasty must abide
with this same soldier and me and the piecrust
will serve us for bread
rarely said phoebe i made the paste
myself it is as thick as the walls fair rosamond's
tower
which two pair jaws would be long in
gnawing through work hard as they might said
the keeper stck
was at present fastened conceiving that this was
some precaution johffes old housekeeper 
whose deafness they were all aware sir henry
raised his voice to demand admittance but in
vain irritated at this delay he pressed the door
at once with foot and hand in a way which the
frail barrier was unable to resist it gave way accordingly
and the knight thus forcibly entered
the kitchen or outward apartment his servant
in the midst the floor and with a posture
which indicated embarrassment stood a youthful
stranger in a ridingsuit
 this may be my last act authority here
said the knight seizing the stranger by the collar
 but i am still ranger woodstock for
this night at least who or what art thou 
the stranger dropped the ridingmantle in
which his face was muffled and at the same time
fell on one knee
your poor kinsman markham everard he
said who came hither for your sake although
he fears you will scarce make him welcome for
this own
sir henry started back but recovered himself
in an instant as one who recollected that he had
woodstock 
a part dignity to perform he stood erect
therefore and replied with considerable assumption
 stately ceremony 
fair kinsman it pleases me that you are
come to woodstock upon the very first night
that for many years which have past is likely to
promise you a worthy or a welcome receptions
now god grant it be so that i rightly hear
and duly understand you said the young man 
while alice though she was silent kept her looks
fixed on her father's face as if desirous to know
whether his meaning was kind towards his nephew
which her knowledge his character inclined
her greatly to doubt
the knight meanwhile darted a sardonic look
first on his nephew then on his daughter and
proceeded i need not i presume inform mr
markham everard that it cannot be our purpose
to entertain him or even to offer him a seat in
this poor hut
i will attend you most willingly to the lodge
said the young gentleman i had indeed j urged
you were already there for the evening and feared
to intrude upon you but if you would permit
me my dearest uncle to escort my king woos
woodstock
man and you back to the lodge believe me
amongst all which you have so often done 
good and kind you never conferred benefit that
will be so dearly prized
you mistake me greatly mr markham everard
replied the knight it is not our purpose
to return to the lodge tonight nor by our
lady tomorrow neither i meant but to intimate
to you in all courtesy that at woodstock
lodge you will find those for whom you are fitting
society and who doubtless will afford you
a willing welcome which i sir in this my present
retreat do not presume to offer to a person
 your consequence
for heaven's sake said the young man
turning to alice tell me how i am to understand
language so mysterious
alice to prevent his increasing the restrained
anger her father compelled herself to answer
though it was with difficulty we are expelled
from the lodge by soldiers
expelled by soldiers exclaimed everard
in surprise there is no legal warrant for this
none at all answered the knight in the
same tone cutting irony which he had all along
woodstock 
used and yet as lawful a warrant as for aught
that has been wrought in england this twelvemonth
and more you are i think or were an
innsofcourtman marry sir your enjoyment
 your profession is like that lease which a prodigal
wishes to have a wealthy widow you
have already survived the law which you studied
and its expiry doubtless has not been without
a legacy some decent pickings some merciful
increases as the phrase goes you have deserved
it two ways you wore buff and bandalier
as well as wielded pen and ink i have not
heard if you held forth too
think me and speak me as harshly as
you will sir said everard submissively i
have but in this evil time guided myself by my
conscience and my father's commands
o an you talk conscience said the old
knight i must have mine eye upon you as
hamlet says never yet did puritan cheat so
grossly as when he was appealing to his conscience
 and as for thy father 
he was about to proceed in a tone the same
invective when the young man interrupted him
 woodstock
by saying in a firm tone sir henry lee you
have ever been thought noble say me what
you will but speak not my father what the
ear a son should not endure and which yet his
arm cannot resent to do me such wrong is to
insult an unarmed man or to beat a captive
sir henry paused as if struck by the remark
 thou hast spoken truth in that mark
wert thou the blackest puritan whom hell ever
vomited to distract an unhappy country
 be that as you will to think it replied everard
 but let me not leave you to the shelter
 this wretched hovel the night is drawing to
storm let me but conduct you to the lodge
and expel these intruders who can as yet at least
have no warrant for what they do i will not
linger a moment behind them save just to deliver
my father's message grant me but this much
for the love you once bore me 
yes mark answered his uncle firmly but
sorrowfully thou speaks truth i did love
thee once the brighthaired boy whom i taught
to ride to shoot to hunt whose hours happiness
were spent with me wherever those gras
ill
ver labours were employed i did love that boy
ay and i am weak enough to love even the
memory what he was but he is gone mark
he is gone and in his room i only behold an
avowed and determined rebel to his religion and
to his king a rebel more detestable on account
 his success the more infamous through the
plundered wealth with which he hopes to gild
his villainy but i am poor thou think'st and
should hold my peace lest men say speak sirrah
when you should know however that
indigent and plundered as i am i feel myself
dishonoured in holding even but this much talk
with the tool usurping rebels go to the
lodge if thou wilt yonder lies the way but
think not that to regain my dwelling there or all
the wealth i ever possessed in my wealthiest days
i would willingly accompany thee three steps on
the greensward if i must be thy companion it
shall be only when thy redcoats have tied my
hands behind me and bound my legs beneath my
horse's belly thou may'st be my fellowtraveller
then i grant thee if thou wilt but not sooner
alice who suffered cruelly during this 
woodstock
hogue and was well aware that farther argument
would only kindle the knight's resentment still
more highly ventured at last in her anxiety to
make a sign to her cousin to break off the interview
and to retire since her father commanded his
absence in a manner so peremptory unhappily
she was observed by sir henry who concluding
that what he saw was evidence a private understanding
betwixt the cousins his wrath acquired
new fuel and it required the utmost exertion
 selfcommand and recollection all that was
due to his own dignity to enable him to veil his
real fury under the same ironical manner which
he had adopted at the beginning this angry ininterview

 if thou art afraid he said to trace our
forestglades by night respected stranger to
whom i am perhaps bound to do honour as my
successor in the charge these walks here seems
to be a modest damsel who will be most willing
to wait on thee and be thy bowbearer only
for her mother's sake let there pass some slight
form marriage between you ye need no licence
or priest in these happy days but may be
buckled like beggars in a ditch with a hedge for
woodstock 
a churchroof and a tinker for a priest i crave
pardon you for making such an officious and
simple request perhaps you are a ranter or
one the family love or hold marriage rites
as unnecessary as knipperdoling or jack 
ley den
for mercy s sake forbear such dreadful jesting
my father and do you markham begone
in god's name and leave us to our fate your
presence makes my father rave
jesting said sir henry i was nevermore
serious raving i was never more composed
 i could never brook that falsehood
should approach me i would no more bear by
my side a dishonoured daughter than a dishonoured
sword and this unhappy day hath shown
that both can fail 
sir henry said young everard load not
your soul with a heavy crime which be assured
you do in treating your daughter thus unjustly
it is long now since you denied her to me when
we were poor and you were powerful i acquiesced
in your prohibition all suit and intercourse
god knoweth what i suffered but i
vol i h
 woodstock
acquiesced neither is it to renew my suit that
i now come hither and have i do acknowledge
sought speech her not for her own sake only
but for yours also destruction hovers over you
ready to close her pinions to stoop and her talons
to clutch yes sir look contemptuous as
you will such is the case and it is to protect both
you and her that i am here
 you refuse then my free gift said sir
henry lee or perhaps you think it loaded
with too hard conditions 
shame shame on you sir henry t said
everard waxing warm in his turn have your
political prejudices so utterly warped every feeling
 a father that you can speak with bitter
mockery and scorn what concerns your own
daughter's honour hold up your head fair
alice and tell your father he has forgotten nature
in his fantastic spirit loyalty know
sir henry that though i would prefer your
daughter's hand to every blessing which heaven
could bestow on me i would not accept it my
conscience would not permit me to do so when
i knew it must withdraw her from her duty to
you
woodstock 
your conscience is over scrupulous young
man carry it to some dissenting rabbi and he
who takes all that comes to net will teach thee
it is sinning against our mercies to refuse any
good thing that is freely offered to us
 when it is freely offered and kindly offered
not when the offer is made in irony and insult
fare thee well alice if aught could make me
desire to profit by thy father's wild wish to cast thee
from him in a moment unworthy suspicion it
would be that while indulging in such sentiments
sir henry lee is tyrannically oppressing the creature
who all others is most dependent on his
kindness who ail others will most feel his
severity and whom all others he is most
bound to cherish and support 
do not fear for me mr everard exclaimed
alice aroused from her timidity by a dread 
the consequences not unlikely to ensue where
civil war set relations as well as fellowcitizens
in opposition to each other oh begone i
conjure you begone nothing stands betwixt me
and my father's kindness but these unhappy family
divisions but your illtimed presence here
for heaven's sake leave us 
 woodstock
soh mistress answered the hot old cavalier
 you play lady paramount already and
who but youyou would dictate to our train i
warrant like general and began but i tel
thee no man shall leave my house and humble
as it is this is now my house while he has
aught to say to me that is to be spoken as this
young man now speaks with a bent brow and a
lofty tone speak out sir and say your worst 
 dear not my temper mrs alice said everard
with equal firmness and placidity manner
 and you sir henry do not think that if
i speak firmly i mean therefore to speak in anger
or officiously you have taxed me with much
and were i guided by the wild spirit romantic
chivalry much which even from so near a relative
i ought not as being by birth and in the
world's estimation a gentleman to pass over
without reply is it your pleasure to give me
patient hearing 
if you stand on your defence answered the
stout old knight god forbid that you should
not challenge a patient hearing ay though your
pleading were two parts disloyalty and one blab
woodstock 
phemy only be brief this has already lasted
but too long
 in the northwest angle it is from a window
in what they call victor lee's apartments
well resumed wildrake i had been
long one lundsford's lads and well used to
patrolling duty so rat me says i if i leave a
light in my rear without knowing what it means
besides mark thou hadst said so much to me
 thy pretty cousin i thought i might as well
have a peep if i could
thoughtless thoughtless incorrigible young
man to what dangers do you expose yourself
and your friends in mere wantonness but goon

by this fair moonshine i believe thou art
jealousy mark everard replied his gay companion
 there is no occasion for in any case i
who was to see the lady was steeled by honour
against the charms my friend's chloe then
the lady was not to see me so could make no
comparisons to thy disadvantage thou knowest 
lastly as it fell out neither us saw the other
at all
 that i am well aware mrs alice left the
lodge long before sunset and never returned
 woodstock
what didst thou see to introduce with such pre
face
 nay no great matter replied wildrake 
only getting upon a sort buttress for i can
climb like any cat that ever mewed in any gutter
and holding on by the vines and creepers
which grew around i obtained a station where i
could see into the inside that same parlour
thou spokes just now
and what saw'st thou there once more demanded
everard
nay no great matter as i said before replied
the cavalier for in these times it is no
new thing to see churls carousing in royal or
noble chambers i saw two stallions engaged
in emptying a solemn stoup strong waters and
dispatching a huge venison pasty which for
their convenience they had placed on a lady's
workingtable one them was trying an air on
a lute
the profane villains exclaimed everard
it was alice's
well said comrade i am glad your phlegm
can be moved i did but throw in these incidents
woodstock 
 the lute and the table to try if it was possible
to get a spark human spirit out you besanctified
as you are
what like were the men said young everard

the one a slouchhatted longcloaked surface
fanatic like the rest you whom i took
to be the steward or commissary i heard spoken
 in the town the other was a short sturdy fellow
with a woodknife at his girdle and a long
quarterstaff lying beside him a blackhaired
knave with white teeth and a merry countenance
 one the underrangers or bowbearers
 these walks i fancy
they must have been desborough's favourite
trusty tomkins said everard and joce
line joliffe the keeper tomkins is desboroughs
right hand an independent and hath pouring
forth as he calls them some think that his gifts
have the better his grace i have heard his
abusing opportunities
they were improving them when i saw
them replied wildrake and made the bottle
smoke for it when as the devil would have
 woodstock
it a stone which had been dislodged from the
crumbling buttress gave way under my weight
a clumsy fellow like thee would have been so
long thinking what was to be done that he
must needs have followed it before he could
make up his mind but i mark i hopped like
a squirrel to an ivy twig and stood fast was
well nigh shot though for the noise alarmed
them both they looked to the oriel and saw me
on the outside the fanatic fellow took out a pistol
 as they have always such texts in readiness
hanging beside the little clasped bible thou
know'st the keeper seized his huntingpole i
treated them both to a roar and a grin thou
must know i can grimace like a baboon i learned
the trick from a french player who could twist
his jaws into a pair nutcrackers and therewithal
i dropped myself sweetly on the grass and
ran off so trippingly keeping the dark side the
wall as long as i could that i am well nigh persuaded
they thought i was their kinsman the
devil come among them uncalled they were
abominably startled
thou art most fearfully rash wildrake
woodstock 
said his companion we are now bound for the
house what if they should remember thee 
why it is no treason is it no one has paid
for peeping since tom coventry's days and
if he came in for a reckoning belike it was fora
better treat than mine but trust me they will
no more know me than a man who had only
seen your friend noll at a conventicle saints
would know the same oliver on horseback and
charging with his lobstertailed squadron or the
same noll cracking a jest and a bottle with
wicked waller the poetae
hush not a word oliver as thou dost
value thyself and me it is ill jesting with the
rock you may split on but here is the gate 
we will disturb these honest gentlemen's recreations

as he spoke he applied the large and ponderous
knocker to the halldoor
rattattattoo said wildrake there is
a fine alarm to you cuckolds and roundheads
he then halfmimicked halfsung the march so
called 
 woodstock
cuckolds come dig cuckolds come dig 
round about cuckolds come dance to my jig 
by heaven this passes midsummer frenzy
said everard turning angrily to him
not a bit not a bit replied wildrake it
is but a slight expectoration just like what one
makes before beginning a long speech i will be
grave for an hour together now i have got that
point war out my head
as he spoke steps were heard in the hall and
the wicket the great door was partly opened
but secured with a chin in case accidents
the visage tomkins and that joceline
beneath it appeared at the chink illuminated by
the lamp which the latter held in his hand and
tomkins demanded the meaning this alarm
i demand instant admittance i said everard
 joliffe you know me well 
i do sirs replied joceline and could admit
you with all my heart but alas sir you
see i am not keykeeper here is the gentleman
whose warrant i must walk by the lord help
me seeing times are such as they be r
i
woodstock 
and when that gentleman who i think maybe
master desborough's valet 
his honour's unworthy secretary an it please
you interposed tomkins while wildrake whispered
in everard's ear i will be no longer secretary
mark thou wert quite right the clerk
must be the more gentlemanly calling
 and if you are master desboroughs secretary
i presume you know me and my condition well
enough said everard addressing the independent
 not to hesitate to admit me and my attendant
to a night's quarters in the lodge 
surely not surely not said the independent
 that is if your worship thinks you would
be better accommodated here than up at the
house entertainment in the town which men
unprofitably call saint george's inn there is
but confined accommodation here your honour
and we have been frayed out our lives already
by the visitation satan albeit his fiery
dart is now quenched
this may be all well in its place sir secretary
said everard and you may find a corner
for it when you are next tempted to play the
i
 woodstock
preacher but i will take it for no apology for
keeping me here in the cold harvest wind and if
not presently received and suitably too i will
report you to your master for insolence in your
office
the secretary desborough did not dare
offer farther opposition for it was well known
that desborough himself only held his consequence
as a kinsman cromwell and the lord
general who was well nigh paramount already
was known to be strongly favourable both to the
elder and younger everard it is true they were
presbyterians and he an independent and that
though sharing those feelings correct morality
and more devoted religious feeling by which
with few exceptions the parliamentarian party
were distinguished the everardss were not disposed
to carry these attributes to the extreme enthusiasm
practised by so many others at the time
yet it was well known that whatever might be
cromwell's own religious creed he was not uniformly
bounded by it in the choice his favourites
but extended his countenance to those who
could serve him even although according to the
woodstock 
phrase the time they came out the darkness
 egypt the character the elder everard
stood very high for wisdom and sagacity besides
being a good family and competent fortune
his adherence would lend a dignity to any side
he might espouse then his son had been a distinguished
and successful soldier remarkable for
the discipline he maintained among his men the
bravery which he showed in the time action
and the humanity with which he was always ready
to qualify the consequences victory such
men were not to be neglected when many signs
combined to show that the parties in the state
who had successfully accomplished the deposition
and death the king were speedily to quarrel
among themselves about the division the spoils
the two everardss were therefore much courted
by cromwell and their influence with him supposed
to be so great that trusty mr secretary
tomkins cared not to expose himself to risk by
contending with colonel everard for such a trifle
as a night's lodging
joceline was active on his side more lights
were obtained more wood thrown on the fire 
vol i k
 woodstock
and the two newlyarrived strangers were introduced
into victor lee's parlour as it was called
from the picture over the chimneypiece which
we have already described it was several minutes
ere colonel everard could recover his general
stoicism deportment so strongly he was
impressed by finding himself in the apartment
under whose roof he had passed so many the
happiest hours his life there was the cabinet
which he had seen opened with such feelings
 delight when sir henry lee deigned to give
him instructions in fishing and to exhibit hooks
and lines together with all the materials for making
the artificial fly then little known there
hung the ancient family picture which from
some odd mysterious expressions his uncle
relating to it had become to his boyhood nay
his early youth a subject curiosity and fear
he remembered how when left alone in the
apartment the searching eye the old warrior
seemed always bent upon his in whatever part
 the room he placed himself and how his childish
imagination was perturbed at a phenomenon
for which he could not account
woodstock 
with these came a thousand more dear and
warmer recollections his early attachment to
his pretty cousin alice when he aided at her
lessons brought water for her flowers or accompanied
her while she sung and he remembered
that while her father looked at them with a goodhumoured
and careless smile he had once heard
him mutter and if it should turn out so why
it might be best for both and the theories 
happiness he had reared on these words all
these visions had been dispelled by the trumpet
 war which called sir henry lee and himself
to opposite sides and the transactions this very
day had shown that even everard's success as a
soldier and a statesman seemed absolutely to prohibit
the chance their being revived
he was waked out this unpleasing reverie
by the approach joceline who being possibly
a seasoned toper had made the additional arrangements
with more expedition and accuracy
than could have been expected from a person
engaged as he had been since nightfall
he now wished to know the colonel's directions
for the night
 woodstock
would he eat anything 
no
 did his honour choose to accept sir henry
lee's bed which was ready prepared 
yes
that mistress alice lee should be prepared
for the secretary
on pain thine ears no replied everard
 where then was the worthy secretary to be
quartered 
in the dogkennel if you list replied colonel
everard but added he stepping to
the sleepingapartment alice which opened
from the parlour locking it and taking out the
key no one shall profane this chamber
had his honour any other commands for the
night 
none save to clear the apartment yonder
man my clerk will remain with me i have
orders which must be written out yet stay
thou gayest my letter this morning to mistress
alice 
 i did
woodstock 
 tell me good joceline what she said when
she received it 
she seemed much concerned sir and indeed
i think that she wept a little but indeed she
seemed very much distressed
 and what message did she send to me 
none may it please your honour she began
to say tell my cousin everard that i will
communicate my uncle's kind purpose to my father
if i can get fitting opportunity but that i
greatly fear and there checked herself as it
were and said i will write to my cousin and
as it may be late ere i have an opportunity 
speaking with my father do thou come for my
answer after service so i went to church myself
to while away the time but when i returned
to the chase i found this man had summoned
my master to surrender and right or wrong i
must put him in possession the lodge i
would fain have given your honour a hint that
the old knight and my young mistress were like
to take you on the form but i could not mend
the matter
thou hast done well good fellow and i will
 woodstock
remember thee and now my masters he said
advancing to the brace clerks or secretaries
who had in the meanwhile sate quietly down beside
the stonebottle and made up acquaintance
over a glass its contents let me remind
you said the colonel that the night wears
late
there is something cries tinkle tinkle in the
bottle yet said wildrake in reply
hem hem hem coughed the colonel 
the parliamentarian service and if his lips did
not curse his companion's imprudence i will not
answer for what arose in his heart well 
he said observing that wildrake had filled his
own glass and tomkins's take that parting
glass and begone
would you not be pleased to hear first
said wildrake how this honest gentleman saw
the devil tonight look through a pane yonder
window and how he thinks he had a mighty
strong resemblance to your worship's humble
slave and varlet scribbler would you but hear
this sir and just sip a glass this very recommendable
strong waters
woodstock 
i will drink none sir said colonel everard
sternly and i have to tell you that you have
drunken a glass too much already mr tompkins
sir i wish you good night
a word in season at parting said tompkins
standing up behind the long leathern back
 a chair hemming and snuffling as if preparing
for an exhortation
excuse me sir replied markham everard
sternly you are not now sufficiently yourself
to guide the devotion others
woe be to them that reject said the secretary
 the commissioners stalking out the
room the rest was lost in shutting the door or
suppressed for fear offence
and n ow fool wildrake begone to thy bed 
yonder it lies pointing to the knight's apartment
what thou hast secured the lady's for thyself
 i saw thee put the key in thy pocket
i would not indeed i could not sleep in
 apartment i can sleep nowhere but i will
watch in this armed chair i have made him place
 wood for repairing the fire good now go to bed
 thyself and sleep off thy liquor
 woodstock
liquor i laugh thee to scorn mark 
thou art a milksop and the son a milksop and
knowest not what a good fellow can do in the way
 crushing an honest cup
the whole vices his faction are in this
poor fellow individually said the colonel to
himself eying his protege askance as the other
retreated into the bedroom with no very steady
pace he is reckless intemperate dissolute 
and if i cannot get him safely shipped for france
he will certainly be both his own ruin and mine 
yet withal he is kind brave and generous and
would have kept the faith with me which he now
expects from me and in what consists the merit
 our truth if we observe not our plighted word
when we have promised to our hurt i will take
the liberty however to secure myself against farther
interruption on his part
so saying he locked the door communication
betwixt the sleepingroom to which the cavalier
had retreated and the parlour and then
after pacing the floor thoughtfully returned to
his seat trimmed the lamp and drew out a number
 letters i will read these over once
woodstock 
more he said that if possible the thought 
public affairs may expel this keen sense personal
sorrow gracious providence where is
this to we have sacrificed the peace our
families the warmest wishes our young hearts
to right the country in which we were born and
to free her from oppression yet it appears that
every step we have made towards liberty has but
brought us in view new and more terrific perils
as he who travels in a mountainous region is by
every step which elevates him highest placed ina
situation more imminent hazard
he read long and attentively various tedious
and embarrassed letters in which the writers
placing before him the glory god and the
freedom and liberties england as their supreme
ends could not by all the ambulatory expressions
they made use prevent the shrewd
eye markham everard from seeing that selfinterest
and views ambition were the principal
moving springs at the bottom their plots
woodstock
chapter 
sleep steals on us even like his brother death
we know not when it comes we know it must come
we may affect to scorn and to contemn it
for tis the highest pride human misery
to say it knows not an opiate 
yet the reft parent the despairing lover
even the poor wretch who waits for execution
feels this oblivion against which he thought
his woes had armed his senses steal upon him
and through the fenceless citadel the body
surprise that haughty garrison the mind
herbert
colonel everard experienced the truth contained
in the verses the quaint old bard whom
we have quoted above amid private grief and
anxiety for a country long a prey to civil war
and not likely to fall soon under any fixed or wellestablished
form government everard and his
father had like many others turned their eyes to
general cromwell as the person whose valour
had made him the darling the army whose
strong sagacity had hitherto predominated over
the high talents by which he had been assailed
woodstock 
in parliament as well as over his enemies in the
field and who was alone in the situation to settle
the station as the phrase then went or in other
words to dictate the mode government the
father and son were both reputed to stand high
in the general's favour but markham everard
was conscious some particulars which induced
him to doubt whether cromwell actually
and at heart bore either to his father or to himself
that goodwill which was generally believed
he knew him for a profound politician who
could veil for any length time his real sentiments
 men and things until they could be displayed
without prejudice to his interest and he
moreover knew that the general was not likely
to forget the opposition which the presbyterian
party had offered to what oliver called the great
matter the trial namely and execution the
king in this opposition his father and he had
anxiously concurred nor had the arguments nor
even the halfexpressed threats cromwell induced
them to flinch from that course far less
to permit their names to be introduced into the
commission nominated to sit in judgment on that
memorable occasion
 woodstock
this hesitation had occasioned some temporary
coldness between the general and the everard
father and son but as the latter remained
in the army and bore arms under cromwell both
in scotland and finally at worcester his services
very frequently called forth the approbation
 his commander after the fight worcester
in particular he was among the number those
officers on whom oliver rather considering the
actual and practical extent his own power than
the name under which he exercised it was with
difficulty withheld from imposing the dignity 
knights bannerets at his own will and pleasure
it therefore seemed that all recollection former
disagreement was obliterated and that the
everardss had regained their former stronghold
in the general's affections there were indeed
several who doubted this and who endeavoured
to bring over this distinguished young officer to
some other the parties which divided the infant
commonwealth but to these proposals he
turned a deaf ear enough blood he said had
been spilled it was time that the nation should
have repose under a firmlyestablished govern
woodstock 
ment strength sufficient to protect property
and lenity enough to encourage the return 
tranquillity this he thought could only be
accomplished by means cromwell and the
greater part england was the same opinion
it was ti'ue that in thus submitting to the domination
 a successful soldier those who did so
forgot the principles upon which they had drawn
the sword against the late king but in revolutions
stern and high principles are often obliged to
give way to the current existing circumstances 
and in many a case where wars have been waged
for points metaphysical right they have been
at last gladly terminated upon the mere hope 
obtaining general tranquillity as after many a
long siege a garrison is often glad to submit on
mere security for life and limb
colonel everard therefore felt that the support
which he afforded cromwell was only under
the idea that amid a choice evils the least
was likely to ensue from a man the general's
wisdom and valour being placed at the head 
the state and he was sensible that oliver himself
was likely to consider his attachment as luke's
woodstock
warm and imperfect and measure his gratitude
for it upon the same limited scale
in the meanwhile however circumstances
compelled him to make trial the generals
friendship the sequestration woodstock and
the warrant to the commissioners to dispose it
as national property had been long granted but
the interest the elder everard had for weeks
and months deferred its execution the hour
was now approaching when the blow could be no
longer parried especially as sir henry lee on
his side resisted every proposal submitting
himself to the existing government and was
therefore now that his hour grace was passed
enrolled in the list stubborn and irreclaimable
malignant with whom the council state was
determined no longer to keep terms the only
mode protecting the old knight and his daughter
was to interest if possible the general himself
in the matter and revolving all the circumstances
connected with their intercourse colonel everard
felt that a request which would so immediately
interfere with the interests desborough the
brotherinlaw cromwell and one the prewoodstock

sent commissioners was putting to a very severe
trial the friendship the latter yet no alternative
remained
with this view and agreeably to a request
from cromwell who at parting had been very
urgent to have his written opinion upon public
affairs colonel everard passed the earlier part
 the night in arranging his ideas upon the state
 the commonwealth in a plan which he thought
likely to be acceptable to cromwell as it exhorted
him under the aid providence to become the
saviour the state by convoking a free parliament
and by their aid placing himself at the head
 some form liberal and established government
which might supersede the estate anarchy
in which the nation was otherwise likely to be
merged taking a general view the totally broken
condition the royalists and the various
factions which now convulsed the state he showed
how this might be done without bloodshed or
violence from this topic he descended to the
propriety keeping up the becoming state the
executive government in whose hands soever it
should be lodged and thus showed cromwell as
the future stadtholder or consul or lieutenants
woodstock
general great britain and ireland a prospect
 demesne and residencies becoming his dignity
then he naturally passed to the dispersing and
destroying the royal residences england
made a woful picture the demolition which impended
over woodstock and interceded for the
preservation that beautiful seat as a matter 
personal favour in which he found himself deeply
interested
colonel everard when he had finished his letter
did not find himself greatly risen in his own
opinion in the course his political conduct
he had till this hour avoided mixing up personal
motives with his public grounds action and
yet he now felt himself making such a composition
but he comforted himself or at least silenced
this unpleasing recollection with the consideration
that the weal britain studied under the
aspect the times absolutely required that
cromwell should be at the head the government
 and that the interest sir henry lee or
rather his safety and his existence no less emphatically
demanded the preservation woodstock
and his residence there was it a fault his that
woods to c 
the same road should lead to both these ends oi
that his private interest and that the country
should happen to mix in the same letter he
hardened himself therefore to the act made up
and addressed his packet to the lord general and
then sealed it with his seal arms this done he
lay back in his chair and in spite his expectations
to the contrary fell asleep in the course
 his reflections anxious and harassing as they
were and did not awaken until the cold grey light
 dawn was peeping through the eastern oriel
he started at first rousing himself with the
sensation one who awakes in a place unknown
to him but the localities instantly forced themselves
on his recollection the lamp burning
dimly in the socket the woodfire almost extinguished
in its own white embers the gloomy
picture over the chimneypiece the sealed packet
on the table all reminded him the events 
yesterday and his deliberations the succeeding
night
there is no help for it he said it must be
cromwell or anarchy and probably the sense
that his title as head the executive governvol
i l
j woodstock
mentis derived merely from popular consent may
check the too natural proneness power to render
itself arbitrary if he govern by parliaments
and with regard to the privileges the subject
wherefore not oliver as well as charles but i
must take measures for having this conveyed
safely to the hands this future sovereign prince
it will be well to take the first word influence
with him since there must be many who will not
hesitate to recommend counsels more violent and
precipitate
he determined to intrust the important packet
to the charge wildrake whose rashness was
never so distinguished as when by any chance he
was left idle and unemployed besides even if
his faith had not been otherwise unimpeachable
the obligations which he owed to his friend everard
must have rendered it such
these conclusions passed through colonel everard's
mind as collecting the remains wood in
the chimney he gathered them into a hearty blaze
to remove the uncomfortable feeling chillness
which pervaded his limbs and by the time he
was a little more warm again sunk into a slumber
woodstock 
which was only dispelled by the beams morning
peeping into his apartment
he arose roused himself walked up and down
the room and looked from the large oriel windows
on the nearest objects which were the untrimmed
hedges and neglected walks a certain
wilderness as it is called in ancient treatises on
gardening which kept yore well ordered and
in all the pride the topiary art presented a
succession yew trees cut into fantastic forms
 close alleys and open walks filling about
two or three acres ground on that side the
lodge and forming a boundary between its immediate
precincts and the open park its enclosure
was now broken down in many places and
the hinds with their fawns fed free and startled
up to the very windows the sylvan palace
this had been a favourite scene markham's
sports when a boy he could still distinguish
though now grown out shape the verdant
battlements a gothic castle all created by the
gardener's shears at which he was accustomed to
shoot his arrows or stalking before it like the
knighterrant whom he read was wont 
 woodstock
blow his horn and bid defiance to the supposed
giant or paynim knight by whom it was garrisoned
he remembered how he used to train his
cousin though several years younger than himself
to bear a part in these revels his boyish
fancy and to play the character an elfin page
or a fairy or an enchanted princess he remembered
too many particulars their later
acquaintance from which he had been almost
necessarily led to the conclusion that from an
early period their parents had entertained some
idea that there might be a wellfitted match betwixt
his fair cousin and himself a thousand
visions formed in so bright a prospect had vanished
along with it but now returned like shadows
to remind him all he had lost and for what 
 for the sake england his proud consciousness
replied england in danger 
becoming the prey at once bigotry and tyranny
and he strengthened himself with the recollection
 if i have sacrificed my private happiness
it is that my country may enjoy liberty
 conscience and personal freedom which under
woodstock 
 weak prince and usurping statesmen she was
but too likely to have lost
but the busy fiend in his breast would not be
repulsed by the bold answer has thy resistance
it demanded availed thy country markham
everard lies not england after so much
bloodshed and so much misery as low beneath
the sword a fortunate soldier as formerly under
the sceptre an encroaching prince are
parliament or what remains them fitted to
contend with a leader master his soldiers
hearts as bold and subtle as he is impenetrable
in his designs this general who holds the
army and by that the fate the nation in his
hand will he lay down his power because philosophy
would pronounce it his duty to become a
subject 
he dared not answer that his knowledge 
cromwell authorized him to expect any such
act selfdenial yet still he considered that
in times such infinite difficulty that must bethe
best government however little desirous in
itself which should most speedily restore peace
to the land and stop the wounds which the 
woodstock
tending parties were daily inflicting on each other
he imagined that cromwell was the only authority
under which a steady government could be
formed and therefore had attached himself to his
fortune though not without considerable and recurring
doubts how far serving the views this
impenetrable and mysterious general was consistent
with the principles under which he had
assumed arms
while these things passed in his mind everard
looked upon the packet which lay on the table
addressed to the lord general and which he had
made up before sleep he hesitated several times
when he remembered its purport and in what
degree he must stand committed with that personage
and bound to support his plans aggrandizement
when once that communication was in
oliver croraweirs possession
yet it must be so he said at last with a
deep sigh among the contending parties he
is the strongest the wisest and most moderate
and ambitious though he be perhaps not the
most dangerous some one must be trusted with
power to preserve and enforce general order and
woodstock 
who can possess or wield such power like him
that is head the victorious armies england 
come what will in future peace and the restoration
 law ought to be our first and most pressing
object this remnant a parliament cannot
keep their ground against the army by mere appeal
to the sanction opinion if they design to
reduce the soldiery it must be by actual warfare
and the land has been too long steeped in blood
but cromwell may and i trust will make a moderate
accommodation with them on grounds by
which peace may be preserved and it is to this
which we must look and trust for a settlement 
the kingdom alas f and for the chance protecting
my obstinate kinsman from the consequences
 his honest though absurd pertinacity
silencing some internal feelings doubt and
reluctance by such reasoning as this markham
everard continued in his resolution to unite himself
with cromwell in the struggle which was
evidently approaching betwixt the civil and military
authorities not as the course which if at
perfect liberty he would have preferred adopting
but as the best choice between two dangerous
 woodstock
extremities to which the times had reduced him
he could not help trembling however when he
recollected that his father though hitherto the
admirer cromwell as the implement by whom
so many marvels had been wrought in england
might not be disposed to unite with his interest
against that the long parliament which
he had been till partly laid aside by continued
indisposition an active and leading member
this doubt also he was obliged to swallow or
strangle as he might but consoling himself with
the ready argument that it was impossible his
father could see matters in another light than
that in which they occurred to himself
woodstock 
chapter vii
determined at length to dispatch his packet
to the general without delay colonel everard
approached the door the apartment in which
as was evident from the dead breathing within the
prisoner wildrake enjoyed a deep slumber under
the influence liquor at once and fatigue in
turning the key the bolt which was rather rusty
made a resistance so noisy as partly to attract
the sleepers attention though not to awake him
everard stood by his bedside as he heard him
mutter is it morning already jailor why
you dog an you had but a cast humanity in
you you would qualify your vile news with a cup
 sack hanging is sorry work my masters 
and sorrow's dry
up wildrake up thou illomened dreamers
said his friend shaking him by the collar

 woodstock
hands off answered the sleeper i can
climb a ladder without help i trow he then
sate up in the bed and opening his eyes stared
around him and exclaimed zounds mark is
it only thou i thought it was all over with me
fetters were struck from my legs rope drawn
round my gullet irons knocked off my hands
hempen cravat tucked on all ready for a dance
in the open element upon slight footing
truce with thy folly wildrake sure the
devil drink to whom thou hast i think sold
thyself 
for a hogshead sack interrupted wildrake
 the bargain was made in a cellar in the
wintry
i am as mad as thou art to trust anything
to thee said markham i scarce believe thou
hast thy senses yet
what should ail me said wildrake i
trust i have not tasted liquor in my sleep saving
that i dreamed drinking smallbeer with old
noll his own brewing but do not look so
glum manpi am the same roger wildrake
that i ever was as wild as a mallard but as true
woodstock 
as a gamecock i am thine own chum manbound
to thee by thy kind deedsvinctus he
nefido there is latin for it and where is the
thing thou wilt charge me with that i will not
or dare not execute were it to pick the devil's
teeth with my rapier after he had breakfasted
upon roundheads 
 you will drive me mad said everard 
when i am about to intrust all i have most
valuable on earth to your management your conduct
and language are those a mere bedlamite
last night i made allowance for thy drunken
fury but who can endure thy morning madness 
sit is unsafe for thyself and me wildrake sit
is unkind i might say ungrateful
nay do not say that my friend said the
cavalier with some show feeling and do not
judge me with a severity that cannot apply to
such as i am we who have lost our all in these
sad jars who are compelled to shift for our living
not from day to day but from meal to meal we
whose only hidingplace is the jail whose prospect
 final repose is the gallows what can'st
thou expect from us but to bear such a lot with
 woodstock
a light heart since we should break down under
it with a heavy one 
this was spoken in a tone feeling which
found a responding string in everard's bosom
he took his friend's hand and pressed it kindly
nay if i seemed harsh to thee wild rake
i profess it was for thine own sake more than
mine i know thou hast at the bottom thy
levity as deep a principle honour and feeling
as ever governed a human heart but thou art
thoughtless thou art rash and i protest to
thee that wert thou to betray thyself in this matter
in which i trust thee the evil consequences
to myself would not afflict me more than the
thought putting thee into such danger
nay if you take it on that tone mark
said the cavalier making an effort to laugh evidently
that he might conceal a tendency to a different
emotion thou wilt make children us
both babes and sucklings by the hilt this
bilbo come trust me i can be cautious when
time requires it no man ever saw me drink
when an alert was expected and not one poor
pint wine will i taste until i have managed
woodstock s
this matter for thee well i am thy secretary 
clerk i had forgot and carry thy dispatches to
cromwell taking good heed not to be surprised
or choused out my lump loyalty striking
his finger on the packet and i am to deliver it
to the most loyal hands to which it is most humbly
addressed zooks mark think it a
moment longersurely thou wilt not carry thy
perverseness so far as to strike in with this
bloodyminded rebel bid me give him three
inches my dudgeondagger and i will do if
much more willingly than present him with thy
packets
go to replied everard this is beyond
our bargain if you will help me it is well if not
let me lose no time in debating with thee since
i think every moment an age till the packet is in
the generals possession it is the only way left
me to obtain some protection and a place refuge
for my uncle and his daughter
 that being the case said the cavalier i
will not spare the spur my nag up yonder at
the town will be ready for the road in a trice
and thou mayst reckon on my being with old
t woodstock
noll thy general i mean in as short time as
man and horse may consume betwixt woodstock
and windsor where i think i shall for the present
find thy friend keeping possession where he
has slain
 hush not a word that since we parted
last night i have shaped thee a path which will
suit thee better than to assume the decency 
language and outward manner which thou
hast so little i have acquainted the general that
thou hast been by bad example and bad education

which is to be interpreted by contraries
i hope said wildrake for sure i have been
as well born and bred up as any lad leicestershire
might desire
now i prithee hush thou hast i say by
bad example become at one time a malignant
and mixed in the party the late king but
seeing what things were wrought in the nation by
the general thou hast come to a clearness touching
his calling to be a great implement in the
settlement these distracted kingdoms this
account thee will not only lead him to pass
woodstock 
over some thy eccentricities should they
break out in spite thee but will also give thee
an interest with him as being more especially attached
to his own person 
doubtless said wildrake as every fisher
loves best the trouts that are his own tickling

 it is likely i think he will send thee hither
with letters to me said the colonel enabling
me to put a stop to the proceedings these sequestrators
and to give poor old sir henry lee
permission to linger out his days among the oaks
he loves to look upon i have made it my request
to him and i think my father's friendship
and my own may stretch so far on his regard
without risk cracking especially standing matters
as they now do thou dost understand 
entirely well said the cavalier stretch
quotha i would rather stretch a rope than hold
commerce with the old kingkilling ruffian but
i have said i will be guided by thee markham
and rat me but i will
be cautious then said everard mark
well what he does and says more especially what
p woopstoclc
he does for oliver is one those whose mind
is better known by his actions than by his words
and stay i warrant thee thou wert setting off
without a cross in thy purse 
too true mark said wildrake the last
noble melted last night amongst yonder blackguard
troopers yours
 weil roger replied the colonel that is
easily mended so saying he slipped his purse
into his friend's hand but art thou not an inconsequential
weatherbrained fellow to set forth
as thou wert about to do without anything to bear
thy charges what could'st thou have done
faith i never thought that i must have
cried standi i suppose to the first pursy townsman
or greasy grazier that i met o the heath it
is many a good fellow's shift in these bad times
go to said everard be cautious use
none your loose acquaintance rule your
tongue beware the winepot for there is
little danger if thou could'st only but keep thyself
sober be moderate in speech and forbear
oaths or vaunting
 in short metamorphose myself into such a
u
woodstock 
prig as thou art mark well said wildrake
 so far as outside will go i think i can make
a hopeonhigh bomhy as well as thou canst
ah those were merry days when we saw mills
present bombay at the fortune playhouse mark
ere i had lost my laced cloak and the jewel in my
ear or thou hadst gotten the wrinkle on thy brow
and the puritanic twist thy mustachio 
they were like most worldly pleasures wildrake
replied everard sweet in the mouth and
bitter in digestion but away with thee and
when thou bring'st back my answer thou wilt
find me either here or at saint george's inn at
the little borough good luck to thee be but
cautious how thou dearest thyself
the colonel remained in deep meditation 
 i think he said i have not pledged myself
too far to the general a breach between him
and the parliament seems inevitable and would
throw england back into civil war which all
men are wearied he may dislike my messenger
 a puritanic character in one beaumont and fletchers
plays
vol i k
 woodstock
yet that i do not greatly fear he knows i
would choose such as i can myself depend on
and hath dealt enough with the stricter sort to
be aware that there are among them as well as
elsewhere men who can hide two faces under
one hood
woodstock 
chapter viii
for there in lofty air was seen to stand
the stern protector the conquered land 
drawn in that look with which he wept and swore
turn'd out the members and made fast the door
ridding the house every knave and drone
forced though it grieve his soul to rule alone
the frank courtship crabbe
leaving colonel everard to his meditations
we follow the jolly cavalier his companion who
before mounting at the george did not fail to
treat himself to his morningdraught eggs and
muscadine to enable him to face the harvest
wind
although he had suffered himself to be sunk
in the extravagant license which was practised
by the cavaliers as if to oppose their conduct in
every point to the preciseness their enemies
 woodstock
yet wildrake wellborn and welleducated and
endowed with good natural parts and a heart
which even debauchery and the wild life a
roaring cavalier had not been able entirely to
corrupt moved on his present embassy with a
strange mixture feelings such as perhaps he
had never in his life before experienced
his feelings as a royalist led him to detest cromwell
whom in other circumstances he would scarce
have wished to see except in a field battle
where he could have had the pleasure to exchange
pistolshots with him but with this hatred there
was mixed a certain degree fear always victorious
wherever he fought the remarkable person
whom wildrake was now approaching had
acquired that influence over the minds his enemies
which constant success is so apt to inspire
they dreaded while they hated him and joined
to these feelings was a restless meddling curiosity
which made a particular feature in wildrakes
character who having long had little business
 his own and caring nothing about that
which he had was easily attracted by the desire
woodstock 
 seeing whatever was curious or interesting
around him
i should like to see the old rascal after all
he said were it but to say that i had seen him
he reached windsor in the afternoonand
felt on his arrival the strongest inclination to
take up his residence at some his old haunts
when he had occasionally frequented that fair
town in gayer days but resisting all temptations
 this kind he went courageously to the principal
inn from which its ancient emblem the
garter had long disappeared the master too
whom wildrake experienced in his knowledge
 landlords and hostelries had remembered a
dashing mine host queen bess's school had
now sobered down to the temper the times
shook his head when he spoke the parliament
wielded his spigot with the gravity a priest
conducting a sacrifice wished england a happy
issue out all her afflictions and greatly lauded
his excellency the lord general wildrake
also remarked that his wine was better than it
was wont to be the puritans having an excellent
gift at detecting every fallacy in that matter
 woodstock
and that his measures were less and his charges
larger circumstances which he was induced to
attend to by mine host talking a good deal about
his conscience
he was told by this important personage that
the lord general received frankly all sorts 
persons and that he might obtain access to him
next morning at eight o'clock for the trouble 
presenting himself at the castlegate and announcing
himself as the bearer dispatches to his
excellency
to the castle the disguised cavalier repaired
at the hour appointed admittance was freely
permitted to him by the redcoated soldier who
with austere looks and his musket on his shoulder
mounted guard at the external gate that
noble building wildrake passed through the
under ward or court gazing as he passed upon
the beautiful chapel which had but lately received
in darkness and silence the unhonoured
remains the slaughtered king england
rough as wildrake was the recollection 
this circumstance affected him so strongly that
lie had nearly turned back in a sort horror
woodstock 
rather than face the dark and daring man to
whom amongst all the actors in that melancholyaffair
its tragic conclusion was chiefly to be imputed
but he felt the necessity subduing all
sentiments this nature and compelled himself
to proceed in a negotiation intrusted to his conduct
by one to whom he was so much obliged as colonel
everard at the ascent which passed by the
round tower he looked to the ensignstaff from
which the banner england was wont to float
it was gone with all its rich emblazonry its gorgeous
quarterings and splendid embroidery and
in its room waved that the commonwealth
the cross saint george in its colours blue
and red not yet intersected by the diagonal cross
 scotland which was soon after assumed in
evidence england's conquest over her ancient
enemy this change ensigns increased the train
 his gloomy reflections in which although contrary
to his wont he became so deeply wrapped
that the first thing which recalled him to himself
was the challenge from the sentinel accompanied
with a stroke the butt his musket on the
 woodstock
pavement with an emphasis which made wildrake
start
whither away and who are you
the bearer a packet answered wildrake
to the worshipful the lord general 
stand till i call the officer the guard
the corporal made his appearance distinguished
above those his command by a double
quantity band round his neck a double
height steeplecrowned hat a larger allowance
 cloak and a treble proportion sour gravity
 aspect it might be read on his countenance
that he was one those tremendous enthusiasts
to whom oliver owed his conquests whose religious
zeal made them even more than a match for
the highspirited and highborn cavaliers who
exhausted their valour in vain in defence their
sovereign's person and crown he looked with
grave solemnity at wildrake as if he was making
in his own mind an inventory his features and
dress and having fully perused them he required
 to know his business
my business said wildrake as firmly as he
could for the close investigation this man had
woodstock 
given him some unpleasant nervous sensations
 ray business is with your general
with his excellency the lord general thou
would'st say replied the corporal thy
speech my friend savours too little the reverence
due to his excellency
 d n his excellency was at the lips the
cavalier but prudence kept guard and permitted
not the offensive words to escape the barrier he
only bowed and was silent
 follow me said the starched figure whom
he addressed and wildrake followed him accordingly
into the guardhouse which exhibited an
interior characteristic the times and very different
from what such military stations present
at the present day
by the fire sat two or three musketeers listening
to one who was expounding some religious mystery
to them he began half beneath his breath
but in tones great volubility which tones as he
approached the conclusion became sharp and eager
as challenging either instant answer or silent
acquiescence the audience seemed to listen to
the speaker with immovable features only answering
him with clouds tobaccosmoke which
 woodstock
they rolled from under their thick mustachios on
a bench lay a soldier on his face whether asleep
or in a hit contemplation k was impossible to
decide in the midst the floor stood an officer
as he seemed by his embroidered shoulderbelt and
scarf round his waist otherwise very plainly attired
who was engaged in drilling a stout bumpkin
lately enlisted to the manual as it was then
used the motions and words command were
twenty at the very least and until they were
regularly brought to an the corporal did not
permit wildrake either to sit down or move forward
beyond the threshold the guardhouse
so he had to listen in succession to poize your
musket rest your musket cock your musket
handle your primers and many other forgotten
words discipline until at length the words
 order your musket ended the drill for the
time
thy name friend said the officer to the
recruit when the lesson was over
ephraim answered the fellow with an affect
ed twang through the nose
 and what besides ephraim 

woodstock 
 ephraim cobb from the godly city glocester
where i have dwelt for seven years serving
apprentice to a praise worthy cordwainer
it is a goodly craft answered the officer 
 but casting in thy lot with ours doubt not that
thou shalt be set beyond thine awl and thy last
to boot
a grim smile the speaker accompanied this
poor attempt at a pun and then turning round
to the corporal who stood two paces off with the
face one who seemed desirous speaking
said how now corporal what tidings 
 here is one with a packet and please your
excellency said the corporal surely my
spirit does not rejoice in him seeing i esteem him
as a wolf in sheep's clothing
by these words wildrake learned that he was
in the actual presence the remarkable person
to whom he was commissioned and he paused
to consider in what manner he ought to address
him
the figure oliver cromwell was as is generally
known in no way prepossessing he
was middle stature strong and coarsely made
with harsh and severe features indicative how
 woodstock
ever much natural sagacity and depth 
thought his eyes were grey and piercing his
nose too large in proportion to his other features
his manner speaking when he had the purpose
to make himself distinctly understood was
energetic and forcible though neither graceful
nor eloquent no man could on such occasion
put his meaning into fewer and more decisive
words but when as it often happened he had
a mind to play the orator for the benefit peoples
ears without enlightening their understanding
cromwell was wont to invest his meaning or
that which seemed to be his meaning in such a
mist words surrounding it with so many exclusions
and exceptions and fortifying it with such a
labyrinth parentheses that though one the
most shrewd men in england he was perhaps
tho most unintelligible speaker that ever perplexed
an audience it has been long since said by
the historian that a collection the protector's
speeches would make with a few exceptions the
most nonsensical in the world but he ought
to have added that nothing could be more nervous
concise and intelligible than what he really
intended should be understood
woodstock 
it was also remarked cromwell that though
born a good family both by father and mother
and although he had the usual opportunities 
education and breeding connected with such an
advantage the fanatic democratic ruler could
never acquire or else disdained to practise the
courtesies usually exercised among the higher
classes in their intercourse with each other his
demeanour was so blunt as sometimes might be
termed clownish yet there was in his language
and manner a force and energy corresponding to
his character which impressed awe if it did not
impose respect and there were even times when
that dark and subtle spirit expanded itself so as
almost to conciliate affection the turn for humour
which displayed itself by fits was broad
and a low and sometimes practical character
something there was in his disposition congenial
to that his countrymen a contempt folly a
hatred affectation and a dislike ceremony
which joined to the strong intrinsic qualities 
sense and courage made him in many respects
not an unfit representative the democracy 
england
his religion must always be a subject much
 woodstock
doubt and probably doubt which he himself
could hardly have cleared up unquestionably
there was a time in his life when he was sincerely
enthusiastic and when his natural temper slightly
subject to hypochondria was strongly agitated
by the same fanaticism which influenced so
many persons the time on the other hand
there were periods during his political career
when we certainly do him no injustice in charging
him with hypocritical affectation we shall
probably judge him and others the same age
most truly if we suppose that their religious
professions were partly influential in their own
breast partly assumed in compliance with their
own interest and so ingenious is the human
heart in deceiving itself as well as others that it
is probable neither cromwell himself nor those
making similar pretensions to distinguished piety
could exactly have fixed the point at which their
enthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced
 or rather it was a point not fixed in itself
but fluctuating with the state health 
good or bad fortune high or low spirits affecting
the individual at the period
such was the celebrated person who turning
woodstock 
round on wildrake and scanning his countenance
closely seemed so little satisfied with what
he beheld that he instinctively hitched forward
his belt so as to bring the handle his tucksword
within his reach but yet folding his arms
in his cloak as if upon second thoughts laying
aside suspicion or thinking precaution beneath
him he asked the cavalier what he was and whence
he came 
a poor gentleman sir that is my lord
answered wildrake last from woodstock
and what may your tidings be sir gentleman
 said cromwell with an emphasis truly
i have seen those most willing to take upon
them that title bear themselves somewhat short
 wise men and good men and true men withall
their gentility yet gentleman was a good
title in old england when men remembered what
it was construed to mean
you say truly sir replied wildrake suppressing
with difficulty some his usual wild
expletives v formerly gentlemen were found in
gentlemen's places but now the world is so changed
that you shall find the broidered belt has
changed place with the under spur leather

woodstock
say'st thou me said the general i profess
thou art a bold companion that can bandy
words so wantonly thou king's somewhat too
loud to be good metal methinks and once
again what are thy tidings with me 
this packet said wildrake commended
to your hands by colonel markham everard
alas i must have mistaken thee answered
cromwell mollified at the mention a man's
name whom he had great desire to make his
own forgive us good friend for such we
doubt not thou art sit thee down and commune
with thyself as thou mayst until we have
examined the contents thy packet let him
be looked to and have what he lacks so saying
the general left the guardhouse where
wildrake took his seat in the corner and awaited
with patience the issue his mission
the soldiers now thought themselves obliged to
treat him with more consideration and offered him
a pipe trinidad and a black jack filled with
october but the look cromwell and the dangerous
situation in which he might be placed by
the least chance detection induced wildrake to
woodstock 
decline these hospitable offers and stretching
back in his chair and affecting slumber he escaped
notice or conversation until a sort aiddecamp
or military officer in attendance came
to summon him to cromwelps presence
by this person he was guided to a posterngate
through which he entered the body the
castle and penetrating through many private
passages and staircases he at length was introduced
into a small cabinet or parlour in which
was much rich furniture some bearing the royal
cypher displayed but all confused and disarranged
together with several paintings in massive
frames having their faces turned towards the wall
as if they had been taken down for the purpose
 being removed
in this scene disorder the victorious general
 the commonwealth was seated in a large
easy chair covered with damask and deeply
embroidered the splendour which made a
strong contrast with the plain and even homely
character his apparel although in look and
action he seemed like one who felt that the seat
which might have in former days held a prince
vol i n
 woodstock
was not too much distinguished for his own fortunes
and ambition wildrake stood before him
nor did he ask him to sit down
 pearson said cromwell addressing himself
to the officer in attendance wait in the gallery
but be within call pearson bowed and was
retiring w ho are in the gallery besides 
worthy mr gordon the chaplain was holding
forth but now to colonel overtop and four
captains your excellency's regiment
we would have it so said the general 
we would not there were any corner in our
dwelling where the hungry soul might not meet
with manna was the good man carried onward
in his discourse 
mightily borne through said pearson
 and he was touching the rightful claims which
the army and especially your excellency hath
acquired by becoming the instruments in the
great work not instruments to be broken asunder
and cast away when the day their service
is over but to be preserved and held precious
and prized for their honourable and faithful labours
for which they have fought and marched
woodstock 
and fasted and prayed and suffered cold and
sorrow while others who would now gladly see
them disbanded and broken and cashiered eat
 the fat and drink the strong
ah good man said cromwell and did
he touch upon this so feelingly i could say
something but not now begone pearson to
the gallery let not our friends lay aside their
swords but watch as well as pray
pearson retired and the general holding the
letter everard in his hand looked again fora
long while fixedly at wildrake as if considering
in what strain he should address him
when he did speak it was at first in one 
those ambiguous discourses which behave already
described and by which it was very difficult for
any one to understand his meaning if indeed
he knew it himself we shall be as concise in
our statement as our desire to give the very
words a man so extraordinary will permit
this letter he said you have brought
us from your master or patron markham everard
 truly an excellent and honourable gentleman
as ever bore a sword upon his thigh and
 woodstock
one who hath ever distinguished himself in the
great work delivering these three poor and
unhappy nations answer me not i know what
thou would'st say and this letter he hath sent
to me by thee his clerk or secretary in whom
he hath confidence and in whom he prays me to
have trust that there may be a careful messenger
between us and lastly he hath sent thee
to me do not answer i know what thou
would'st say to me who albeit i am that
small consideration that it would be too much
honour for me even to bear a albert in this
great and victorious army england am nevertheless
exalted to the rank holding the guidance
and the leadingstaff thereof nay do not
answer my friend i know what thou would'st
say now when communing thus together our
discourse taketh in respect to what i have said
a threefold argument or division first as it
concerned thy master secondly as it concerned
us and our office thirdly and lastly as it
touched thyself now as concerning this good
and worthy gentleman colonel markham everard
truly he hath played the man from the bewoodstock

ginning these unhappy buffetings not turning
to the right or to the left but holding ever in
his eye the mark at which he aimed ay truly
a faithful honourable gentleman and one who
may well call me friend and truly i am pleased
to think that he doth so nevertheless in this
vale tears we must be governed less by our
private respects and partialities than by those
higher principles and points duty whereupon
the good colonel markham everard hath ever
framed his purposes as truly i have endeavoured
to form mine that we may all act as becometh
good englishmen and worthy patriots
then as for woodstock it is a great thing which
the good colonel asks that it should be taken
from the spoil the godly and left in keeping
 the men moab and especially the malignant
henry lee whose hand hath been ever
against us when he might find room to raise it 
i say he hath asked a great thing both in respect
 himself and me for we this poor but
godly army england are holden by these
 the parliament as men who should render in
spoil for them but be no sharer it ourselves 
even as the buck which the hounds pull to earth
 woodstock
furmsheth no part their own food but they are
lashed off from the carcase with whips like those
which require punishment for their forwardness
not reward for their services yet i speak not
this so much in respect this grant woodstock
in regard that perhaps their lordships
 the council and also the committeemen 
this parliament may graciously think they have
given me a portion in the matter in relation that
my kinsman desborough hath an interest allowed
him therein which interest as he hath well deserved
it for his true and faithful service to these
unhappy and devoted countries so it would ill
become me to diminish the same to his prejudice
unless it were upon great and public respects
thus thou seest how it stands with me my honest
friend and in what mind i stand touching
this thy master's request to me which yet i do
not say that i can altogether or unconditionally
grant or refuse but only tell my simple thoughts
with regard thereto thou understands me i
doubt not
now roger wildrake with all the attention
he had been able to pay to the lord general's
speech had got so much confused among the
woodstock 
various clauses the harangue that his brainwas
bewildered like that a country clown
when he chances to get himself involved among
a crowd carriages and cannot stir a step to
get out the way one's them without being
in danger being ridden over by the others
the general saw his look perplexity and
began a new oration to the same purpose as before
 spoke his love for his kind friend the
colonel his regard for his pious and godly
kinsman master desborough the great importance
 the palace and park woodstock the
determination the parliament that it should
be confiscated and the produce brought into the
coffers the state his own deep veneration for
the authority parliament and his no less deep
sense the injustice done to the army how it
was his wish and will that all matters should be
settled in an amicable and friendly manner without
selfseeking debate or strife betwixt those
who had been the hands acting and such as
had been the heads governing in that great national
cause how he was willing truly willing
to contribute to this work by laying down not
his commission only but his life also if it were
 woodstock
requested him or could be granted with safety
to the poor soldiers to whom silly poor men he
was bound to be as a father seeing that they
had followed him with the duty and affection 
children
and here he arrived at another dead pause
leaving wildrake as uncertain as before whether
it was or was not his purpose to grant
colonel everard the powers he had asked for
the protection woodstock against the parliamentary
commissioners internally he began
to entertain hopes that the justice heaven or
the effects remorse had confounded the regicide's
understanding but no he could see
nothing but sagacity in that steady stern eye
which while the tongue poured forth its periphrastic
language in such profusion seemed to
watch with severe accuracy the effect which his
oratory produced on the listener
egad thought the cavalier to himself
becoming a little familiar with the situation in
which he was placed and rather impatient a
conversation which led to no visible conclusion
or termination if noll were the devil himself
woodstock 
as he is the devil's darling i will not be thus
noseled by him i'll e'en brusque it a little if
he goes on at this rate and try if i can bring
him to a more intelligible mode speaking
entertaining this bold purpose but half afraid
to execute it wildrake lay by for an opportunity
 making the attempt while cromwell was
apparently unable to express his own meaning
he was already beginning a third panegyric upon
colonel everard with sundry varied expressions
 his own wish to oblige him when wildrake
took the opportunity a pause to strike in on
the general's making one his oratorical pauses
so please you he said bluntly your word
ship has already spoken on two topics your
discourse your own worthiness and that my
master colonel everard but to enable me todo
mine errand it would be necessary to bestow
a few words on the third head
the third said cromwell
ay said wildrake which in your honour's
subdivision your discourse touched on
my unworthy self what am i to do what portion
am i to have in this matter 
 woodstock
oliver started at once from the tone voice he
had hitherto used and which somewhat resembled
the purring a domestic cat into the growl
 the tiger when about to spring thy portion
jailbird he exclaimed the gallows 
thou shalt hang as high as human if thou betray
counsel but he added softening his voice
keep it like a true man and my favour will bethe
making thee come hither thou art bold
i see though somewhat saucy thou hast been a
malignant so writes my worthy friend colonel
everard but thou hast now given up that falling
cause i tell thee friend not all that the parliament
or the army could do would have pulled
down the stuart out their high places saving
that heaven had a controversy with them well
it is a sweet and comely thing to buckle on one's
armour in behalf heaven's cause otherwise
truly for mine own part these men might have
remained upon the throne even unto this day
neither do i blame any for aiding them until
these successive great judgments have overwhelmed
them and their house i am not a
bloody man having in me the feeling human
woodstock 
frailty but friend whosoever putteth his hand
to the plough in the great actings which are now
on foot in these nations had best beware that
they do not look back for rely upon my simple
word that if you fail me i will not spare on you
one foot's length the gallows human let
me therefore know at a word if the leaven thy
malignancy is altogether drubbed out thee 
your honourable lordship said the cavalier
shrugging up his shoulders has done that
for most us so far as cudgelling to some tune
can perform it
say'st thou said the general with a grim
smile on his lip which seemed to intimate that
he was not quite inaccessible to flattery yea
truly thou dost not lie in that we have been an
instrument neither are we as i have already
hinted so severely bent against those who have
striven against us as malignant as others may be
the parliamentmen best know their own interest
and their own pleasure but to my poor
thinking it is full time to close these jars and to
allow men all kinds the means doing service
to their country and we think it will be thy fault
sod
woodstock
if thou art not employed to good purpose for the
state and thyself on condition thou protest away
the old man entirely from thee and gives thy
earnest attention to what i have to tell thee
your lordship need not doubt my attentions
said the cavalier
and the republican general after another
pause as one who gave his confidence not without
hesitation proceeded to explain his views
with a distinctness which he seldom used yet
not without his being a little biassed now and
then by'his long habits circumlocution which
indeed he seldom laid entirely aside save in the
field battle
thou seest he said my friend how
things stand with me the parliament i care
not who knows it love me not still less do the
council state by whom they manage the executive
government the kingdom i cannot
tell why they nourish suspicion against me unless
it is because i will not deliver this poor innocent
army which has followed me in so many
military actions to be now pulled asunder broken
piecemeal and reduced so that they who
woodstock 
have protected the state at the expense their
blood will not have perchance the means 
feeding themselves by their labour which methinks
were hard measure since it is taking
from esau his birthright even without giving
him a poor mess pottage
esau is likely to help himself i think replied
wildrake
truly thou say'st wisely replied the general
 it is ill starving an armed man if there
is food to be had for taking nevertheless far be
it from me to encourage rebellion or want due
subordination to these our rulers i would only
petition in a due and becoming a sweet and harmonious
manner that they would listen to our
conditions and consider our necessities but sir
looking on me and esteeming m so little as they
do you must think that it would be a provocation
in me towards the council state as well
as the parliament if simply to gratify your worthy
master i were to act contrary to their purposes
or deny currency to the commission under
their authority which is as yet the highest
in the state and long may it be so for me to
carry on the sequestration which they intend
soc woodstock
and would it not also be said that i was lending
myself to the malignant interest affording this
den the bloodthirsty and lascivious tyrants 
yore to be in this our day a place refuge to
that old and inveterate amalekite sir henry lee
to keep possession the place in which he hath
so long glorified himself truly it would be a
perilous matter
 am i then to reports said wild rake an
if it please you that you cannot stead colonel
everard in this matter 
 unconditionally aybut taken conditionally
the answer may be otherwise answered
cromwell i see thou art not able to fathom
my purpose and therefore i will partly unfold
it to thee but take notice that should thy
tongue betray my council save in so far as carrying
it to thy master by all the blood which has
been shed in these wild times thou shalt die a
thousand deaths in one 
do not fear me sir said wildrake whose
natural boldness and carelessness character was
for the present time borne down and quelled like
that falcons in the presence the eagle
hear me then said cromwell and let
woodstock son
no syllable escape thee knowest thou not the
young lee whom they call albert a malignant
like his father and one who went up with the
young man to that last ruffle which we had with
him at worcester may we be grateful for the
victory 
i know there is such a young gentleman as
albert lee said wildrake
and knowest thou not i speak not by way
 prying into the good coroners secrets but only
as it behoves me to know something the matter
that i may best judge how i am to serve him 
knowest thou not that thy master markham
everard is a suitor after the sister this same
malignant a daughter the old keeper called
sir henry lee 
all this i have heard said wildrake nor
can i deny that i believe in it
well then go to when the young man
charles stuart fled from the field worcester
and was by sharp chase and pursuit compelled to
separate himself from his followers i know by
sure intelligence that this albert lee was one 
the last who remained with him if not indeed the
very last
 woodstock
it was devilish like him said the cavalier
without sufficiently weighing his expressions considering
in what presence they were to be uttered
 and i'll uphold him with my rapier to bea
true chip the old block
ha dearest thou said the general is
this thy reformation 
i never swear so please you replied wildrake
recollecting himself except there is some
mention malignant and cavaliers in my hearing
 and then the old habit returns and i swear
like one goring's troopers
out upon thee said the general what
can it avail thee to practise a profanity so horrible
to the ears others and which brings no
emolument to him who uses it 
there are doubtless more profitable sins in the
world than the vice swearing was the answer
which rose to the lips the cavalier but that was
exchanged for a profession regret for having
given offence the truth was the discourse began
to take a turn which rendered it more interesting
than ever to wildrake who therefore determined
not to lose the opportunity for obtaining posseswoodstock

sion the secret that seemed to be suspended
on cromwelps lips and that could only be
through means keeping guard upon his own
what sort a house is woodstock said
the general abruptly
an old mansion said wildrake in reply 
and so far as i could judge by a single night's
lodgings having abundance backstairs also
subterranean passages and all the communications
under ground which are common in old
ravennests the sort
and places for concealing priests unquestionably
said cromwell it is seldom that such
ancient houses lack secret stalls wherein to mew
up these calves bethel
your honour's excellency said wildrake
 may swear to that
 i swear not at all replied the general drily
 but what think'st thou good fellow i will
ask thee a blunt question where will those two
worcester fugitives that thou hottest be mcm'e
likely to take shelter and that they must be
sheltered somewhere i well know than in this
same old palace with all the corners and concealvol
i o
sio woodstock
ments whereof young albert hath been acquainted
ever since his earliest infancy 
truly said wildrake making an effort to
answer the question with seeming indifference
while the possibility such an event and its consequences
flashed fearfully upon his mind 
truly i should be your honour's opinion
but that i think the company who by the
commission parliament have occupied woodstock
are likely to fright them thence as a cat
scares doves from a pigeonhouse the neighbourhood
with reverence generals lesbos
and harrison will suit ill with fugitives
from worcesterfield
i thought as much and so indeed would i
have it answered the general long may it be
ere our names shall be aught but a terror to our
enemies but in this matter if thou art an active
plotter for thy master's interest thou might st i
should think work out something favourable to
his present object
my brain is too poor to reach the depth 
your honourable purpose said wildrake
 listen then and let it be to profit answered
cromwell assuredly the conquest at wore

chester was a great and crowning'mercy yet might
we seem to be but small in our thankfulness for
the same did we not do what in us lies towards
the ultimate improvement and final conclusion 
the great work which has been thus prosperous in
our hands professing in pure humility and singleness
 heart that we do not in any way desire
our instrumentality to be remembered nay
would rather pray and entreat that our name and
fortunes were forgotten than that the great work
were in itself incomplete nevertheless truly
placed as we now are it concerns us more nearly
than others that is if so poor creatures should
at all speak themselves as concerned whether
more or less with these changes which have been
wrought around not i say by ourselves or our
own power but by the destiny to which we were
called fulfilling the same with all meekness and
humility i say it concerns us nearly that all
things should be done in conformity with the
great work which hath been wrought and is yet
working in these lands such is my plain and
simple meaning nevertheless it is much to be
desired that this young man this king scots
 woodstock
as he called himself this charles stuart should
not escape forth from the nation where his arrival
has wrought so much disturbance and bloodshed

i have no doubt said the cavalier looking
down that your lordship's wisdom hath directed
all things as they may best lead towards such
a consummation and i pray your pains may be
paid as they deserve
 i thank thee friend said cromwell with
much humility doubtless we shall meet our
reward being in the hands a good paymaster
who never passeth saturday night but understand
me friend i desire no more than my own
share in the good work i would heartily do
what poor kindness i can to your worthy master
and even to you in your degree for such as i do
not converse with ordinary men that our presence
may be forgotten like an everyday's occurrence
we speak to men like thee for their reward or
their punishment and i trust it will be the former
which thou in thine office wilt merit at my
hand
woodstock 
your honour said wildrake speaks like
one accustomed to command
true men's minds are likened to those 
my degree by fear and reverence said the general
 but enough that desiring as i do no
other dependency on my special person than is
alike to us all upon that which is above us but
i would desire to cast this golden ball into your
master's cap he hath served against this charles
stuart and his father but he is a kinsman near
to the old knight lee and stands well affected
towards his daughter thou also wilt keep a
watch my friend that ruffling look thine will
procure thee the confidence every malignant
and the prey cannot approach this cover as
though to shelter like a coney in the rocks but
thou wilt be sensible his presence
i make a shift to comprehend your excellency
said the cavalier and i thank you
heartily for the good opinion you have put upon
me and which i pray i may have some handsome
opportunity deserving that i may show
my gratitude by the event but still with reverence
your excellency's scheme seems unlikely
while woodstock remains in possession the
 woodstock
sequestrated both the old knight and his son
and far more such a fugitive as your honour hinted
at will take special care not to approach it till
they are removed
it is for that i have been dealing with thee
thus long said the general i told thee that
i was something unwilling upon slight occasion
to dispossess the sequestrated by my own proper
warrant although having perhaps sufficient authority
in the state both to do so and to despise
the murmurs those who blame me in brief
i would be loath to tamper with my privileges
and make experiments between their strength
and the powers the commission granted by
others without need or at least great prospect 
advantage so if thy colonel will undertake for
his love the republic to find the means 
preventing its worst and nearest danger which
must needs occur from the escape this young
man and will do his endeavour to stay him incase
his flight should lead him to woodstock
which i hold very likely i will give thee an order
to these sequestrated to evacuate the palace
instantly and to the text troop my regiment
which lies at oxford to turn them out by the
woodstock 
shoulders if they make any scruples ay even
for example's sake if they drag desborough out
foremost though he be wedded to my sister
so please you sir said wildrake and
with your most powerful warrant i trust i might
expel the commissioners even without the aid
 your most warlike and devout troopers
that is what i am least anxious about replied
the general i should like to see the best
 them sit after i had nodded to them to begone
 always excepting the worshipful house
in whose name our commissions run but who as
some think will be done with politics ere it be
time to renew them therefore what chiefly
concerns me to know is whether thy master
will embrace a traffic which hath such a fair
promise profit with it i am well convinced
that with a scout like thee who hast been in the
cavaliers quarters and canst i should guess
resume thy drinking ruffianly healthquaffing
manners whenever thou hast a mind he must
discover where this stuart hath ensconced himself
either the young lee will visit the old
one in person or he will write to him or hold
 woodstock
communication with him by letter at all events
markham everard and thou must have an eye
in every hair your head while he spoke a
flush passed over his brow he rose from his chair
and paced the apartment in agitation woe
to you if you suffer the young adventurer to
escape me you had better be in the deepest
dungeon in europe than breathe the air england
should you but dream playing me false
i have spoken freely to thee fellow more freely
than is my wont the time required it but to
share my confidence is ike keeping a watch over
a powdermagazine the least and most insignificant
spark blows thee to ashes tell your master
what i said but not how i said it fie
that i should have been betrayed into the distemperature
 passion begone sirrah pearson
shall bring thee sealed orders yet stay
thou hast something to ask
i would know sid wildrake to whom
the visible anxiety the general gave some
confidence what is the figure this young
gallant in case i should find him 
a tall rawboned swarthy lad they say
woodstock 
he has shot up into here is his picture by a
good hand some time since he turned round
one the portraits which stood with its face
against the wall but it proved not to be that 
charles the second but his unhappy father
the first motion cromwell indicated a purpose
 hastily replacing the picture and it seemed
as if an effort was necessary to repress his disinclination
to look upon it but he did repress
it and placing the picture against the wall withdrew
slowly and sternly as if in defiance his
own feeling he was determined to gain a place
from which to see it to advantage it was well for
wildrake that his dangerous companion had not
turned an eye on him for his blood also kindled
when he saw the portrait his master in the
hands the chief author his death being a
fierce and desperate man he commanded his passion
with great difficulty and if on its first violence
he had been provided with a suitable weapon
it is possible cromwell would never have
ascended higher in his bold ascent towards supreme
power
but this natural and sudden flash indignant
woodstock
lion which rushed through the veins an ordinary
man like wildrake was presently subdued
when confronted with the strong yet stifled emotion
displayed by so powerful a character as
cromwell as the cavalier looked on his dark
and bold countenance agitated by inward and
indescribable feelings he found his own violence
 spirit die away and lose itself in fear and
wonder so true it is that as greater lights
swallow up and extinguish the display those
which are less so men great capacious and
overruling minds bear aside and subdue in
their climax passion the more feeble wills
and passions others as when a river joins a
brook the fiercer torrent shoulders aside the
smaller stream
wildrake stood a silent inactive and almost
a terrified spectator while cromwell assuming
a firm sternness eye and manner as one who
compels himself to look on what some strong internal
feeling renders painful and disgustful to
him proceeded in brief and interrupted expressions
but yet with a firm voice to comment on
the portrait the late king his words seemed
woodstock 
less addressed to wildrake than to be the spontaneous
unburthening his own bosom swelling
under recollection the past and anticipation
 the future
that flemish painter he said that antonio
vandyke what a power he has steel
may mutilate warriors may waste and destroy 
still the king stands uninjured by time and our
grandchildren while they read his history may
look on his image and compare the melancholy
features with the woful tale it was a stern necessity
 it was an awful deed the calm pride
 that eye might have ruled worlds crouching
frenchmen or supple italians or formal spaniards
but its glances only roused the native
courage the stern englishman slay not on
poor sinful man whose breath is in his nostrils
the blame that he falls when heaven never gave
him strength nerves to stand the weak rider
is thrown by his unruly horse and trampled to
death the strongest man the best cavalier
springs to the empty saddle and uses bit and
spur till the fiery horse knows its master who
blames him who mounted aloft rides triumphs
 woodstock
aptly amongst the people for having succeeded
where the unskilful and feeble fell and died
verily he hath his reward then what is that
piece painted canvass to me more than others 
no let him show to others the reproaches 
that cold calm face that proud yet complaining
eye those who have acted on higher respects
have no cause to start at painted shadows not
wealth nor power brought me from my obscurity
the oppressed consciences the injured
liberties england were the banner that i followed

he raised his voice so high as if pleading in
his own defence before some tribunal that pearson
the officer in attendance looked into the
apartment and observing his master with his
eyes kindling his arm extended his foot advanced
and his voice raised like a general in
the act commanding the advance his army
he instantly withdrew
it was other than selfish regards that drew
me forth to action continued cromwell and
i dare the world ay living or dead i challenge
to assert that i armed for a private cause or
woodstock 
as a means enlarging my fortunes neither
was there a trooper in the regiment who came
there with less evil will to yonder unhappy
 
at this moment the apartment opened and a
gentlewoman entered who from her resemblance
to the general although her features were soft
and feminine might be immediately recognised
as his daughter she walked up to cromwell
gently but firmly passed her arm through his
and said to him in a persuasive tone father
this is not well you have promised me this
should not happen
the general hung down his head like one
who was either ashamed the passion to which
he had given way or the influence which was
exercised over him he yielded however to
the affectionate impulse and left the apartment
without again turning his head towards the portrait
which had so much affected him
 woodstock
chapter 
doctorego to go to you have known what you should not
macbeth
wildrake was left in the cabinet astonished
and alone it was often noised about that cromwell
the deep and sagacious statesman the
calm and intrepid commander he who had overcome
such difficulties and ascended to such
heights that he seemed already to bestride the
land which he had conquered had like many
other men great genius a constitutional taint
 melancholy which sometimes displayed itself
both in words and actions and had been first
observed in that sudden and striking change
when abandoning entirely the dissolute freaks
 his youth he embraced a very strict course 
woodstock 
religious observances which upon some occasions
he seemed to consider as bringing him into
more near and close contact with the spiritual
world this extraordinary man is said sometimes
during that period his life to have
given way to spiritual delusions or as he himself
conceived them prophetic inspirations 
approaching grandeur and strange deep and
mysterious agencies in which he was in future to
be engaged in the same manner as his younger
years had been marked by fits exuberant and
excessive frolic and debaucheries something 
this kind seemed to explain the ebullitions 
passion which he had now manifested
with wonder at what he had witnessed wildrake
felt some anxiety on his own account though
not the most reflecting mortals he had sense
enough to know that it is dangerous to be a witness
 the infirmities men high in power and
he was left so long by himself as induced him to
entertain some secret doubts whether the general
might not be tempted to take means confining
or removing a witness who had seen him lowered
as it seemed by the suggestions his own
 woodstock
conscience beneath that lofty flight which in
general he affected to sustain above the rest 
the sublunary world
in this however he wronged cromwell who
was free either from an extreme degree jealous
suspicion or from anything which approached
towards bloodhastiness pearson appeared
after lapse about an hour and intimating to
wildrake that he was to follow conducted him
into a distant apartment in which he found the
general seated on a low couch his daughter
was in the apartment but remained at some distance
seemed busied with some female work and
scarce turned her head as pearson and wildrake
entered
at a sign from the lord general wildrake
approached him as before friend he said
your old friends the cavaliers look on me as
their enemy and conduct themselves towards meas
if they desired to make me such i profess
they are labouring to their own prejudice for i
regard and have ever regarded them as honest
and honourable fools who were silly enough to
run their necks into nooses and their heads
woodstock 
against stonewalls that a man called stuart and
no other should be king over them fools 
are there no words made letters that would
sound as well as charles stuart with that magic
title beside them why the word king is like
a lighted lamp that throws the same bright gilding
upon any combination the alphabet and
yet you must shed your blood for a name but
thou for thy part shalt have no wrong from me
here is an order well warranted to clear the
lodge at woodstock and abandon it to thy master's
keeping or those whom he shall appoint
he will have his uncle and pretty cousin with
him doubtless fare thee well think on what
i told thee they say beauty is a loadstone
to yonder long lad thou dost wot but i
reckon he has other stars at present to direct his
course than bright eyes and fair hair be it as
it may thou knowest my purpose peer out
peer out keep a constant and careful lookout
on every ragged patch that wanders by hedgerow
or lane these are days when a beggar's
cloak may cover a king's ransom there are
some broad portugal pieces for thee something

 woodstock
strange to thy pouch i ween once more think
on what thou hast heard and he added in a
lower and more impressive tone voice forget
what thou hast seen my service to thy master
 and yet once again rememberaxid jbr
get wildrake made his obeisance and returning
to his inn left windsor with all possible
speed
it was afternoon in the same day when the
cavalier rejoined his roundhead friend who was
anxiously expecting him at the inn in woodstock
appointed for their rendezvous
where hast thou been what hast thou
seen what strange uncertainty is in thy looks 
and why dost thou not answer me 
 because said wildrake laying aside his
riding cloak and rapier you ask so many
questions at once a man has but one tongue
to answer with and mine is well nigh glued to
the roof my mouth
will drink unloosen it said the colonel 
though i dare say thou hast tried that spell at
every alehouse on the road call for what thou
would'st have man only be quick
woodstock iati
 colonel everard answered wildrake i
have not tasted so much as a cup cold water
this day
then thou art out humour for that reason
said the colonel salve thy sore with
brandy if thou wilt but leave being so fantastic
and unlike to thyself as thou slowest in this
silent mood
colonel everard replied the cavalier very
gravely i am an altered man
i think thou dost alter every day in the
year and every hour the day come good
now tell me hast thou seen the general and got
his warrant for clearing out the sequestrated
from woodstock
i have seen the devil said wildrake and
hast as thou sayst got a warrant from him
give it me hastily said everard catching
at the packet
forgive me mark said wildrake if
thou knowest the purpose with which this deed
is granted if thou knowest what is not my
purpose to tell thee what manner hopes are
founded on thy accepting it i have that opinion
 woodstock
 thee mark everard that thou would'st as soon
take a redhot horse shoe from the anvil with thy
bare hand as receive into it this slip paper
come comes said everard this comes 
some your exalted ideas loyalty which
excellent within certain bounds drive us mad
when encouraged up to some heights do not
think since i must needs speak plainly with thee
that i see without sorrow the downfall our
ancient monarchy and the substitution another
form government in its stead but
ought my regret for the past to prevent my acquiescing
and aiding in such measures as are
likely to settle the future the royal cause is
ruined hadst thou and every cavalier in england
sworn the contrary ruined not to rise again
for many a day at least the parliament so
often draughted and drained those who were
courageous enough to maintain their own freedom
 opinion is now reduced to a handful 
statesmen who have lost the respect the people
from the length time during which they
have held the supreme management affairs
they cannot stand long unless they were to
woodstock j
reduce the army and the army late servants
are now masters and will refuse to be reduced
they know their strength and that they maybe
an army subsisting on pay and free quarters
throughout england as long as they will i tell
thee wildrake unless we look to the only man
who can rule and manage them we may expect
military law throughout the land and i for
mine own part look for any preservation our
privileges that may be vouchsafed to us only
through the wisdom and forbearance cromwell
now you have my secret you are aware
that i am not doing the best i would but the
best i can i wish not so ardently as thou
perhaps yet i do wish that the king could have
been restored on good terms composition safe
for us and for himself and now good wildrake
rebel as thou thickest me make me no
worse a rebel than an unwilling one god knows
i never laid aside love and reverence to the king
even in drawing my sword against his ill advisers

ah plague on you said wildrake that
is the very cant itthat's what yoh all say
 woodstock
all you fought against the king in pure love
and loyalty and not otherwise however i see
your drift and i own that i like it better than
i expected the army is your bear now and
old noll is your bear ward and you are like a
country constable who makes interest with the
bernard that he may prevent him from letting
bruin loose well there may come a day when
the sun will shine on our side the fence and
thereon shall you and all the good fairweather
folks who love the stronger party come and
make common cause with us
without much attending to what his friend
said colonel everard carefully studied the warrant
 cromwell it is bolder and more peremptory
than i expected he said the general
must feel himself strong when he opposes
his own authority so directly to that the council
 state and the parliament
 you will not hesitate to act upon it said
wildrake
 that i certainly will not answered everard
 but i must wait till i have the assistance
 the mayor who i think will gladly see these
woodstock si
fellows ejected from the lodge i must not go
altogether upon military authority if possible
then stepping to the door the apartment he
dispatched a servant the house in quest the
chief magistrate desiring he should be made
acquainted that colonel everard desired to see
bim with as little loss time as possible
you are sure he will come like a dog at a
whistle said wildrake the word captain
or colonel makes the fat citizen trot in these
days when one sword is worth fifty corporation
charters but there are dragoons yonder as
well as the grimfaced knave whom i frightened
the other evening when i showed my face in at
the window think'st thou the knaves will show
no rough play 
 the general's warrant will weigh more with
them than a dozen acts parliament said everard
 but it is time thou latest if thou hast
in truth ridden from windsor hither without
baiting
i care not about it said wildrake i
hell thee your general gave me a breakfast
svhich i think will serve me one while if i ever
 woodstock
am able to digest it by the mass it lay so heavy
on my conscience that i carried it to church to
see if i could digest it there with my other sins
but not a avait
to church to the door the church
thou meanest said everard i know thy way
thou art ever wont to pull thy hat off reverently
at the threshold but for crossing it that
day seldom comes
well replied wildrake and if i do pull
off my castor and kneel is it not seemly to show
the same respects in a church which we offer
in a palace it is a dainty matter is it not
to see your anabaptists and brownish and the
rest you gather to a sermon with as little
ceremony as hogs to a trough but here comes
food and now for a grace if i can remember
one
everard was too much interested about the
fate his uncle and his fair cousin and the prospect
 restoring them to their quiet home under
the protection that formidable truncheon which
was already regarded as the leadingstaff england
to remark that certainly a great alteration
woodstock 
had taken place in the manners and outward
behaviour at least his companion his demeanour
frequently evinced a sort struggle
betwixt old habits indulgence and some newly
formed resolutions abstinence and it was
almost ludicrous to see how often the hand 
the neophyte directed itself naturally to a large
black leathern jack which contained two double
flagons strong ale and how often diverted
from its purpose by the better reflections the
reformed toper it seized instead upon a lai'gc
ewer salubrious and pure water 
it was easy to see that the task sobriety
was not yet become easy and that if it had the
recommendation the intellectual portion 
the party who had resolved upon it the outward
man yielded a reluctant and restive compliance
but honest wildrake had been dreadfully frightened
at the course proposed to him by cromwell
and with a feeling not peculiar to the catholic
religion had formed a solemn resolution
within his own mind that if he came off safe and
with honour from this dangerous interview he
would show his sense heavens favour by
s woodstock
renouncing some the sins which most easily
beset him and especially that intemperance
to which like many his wild compeers he was
too much addicted
this resolution or vow was partly prudential
as well as religious for it occurred to him as
very possible that some matters a difficult and
delicate nature might be thrown into his hands
at the present emergency during the conduct
 which it would be fitting for him to act by
some better oracle than that the bottle celebrated
by rabelais in full compliance with this
prudent determination he touched neither the
ale nor the brandy which was placed before him
and declined peremptorily the sack with which
his friend would have garnished the board nevertheless
just as the boy removed the trenchers
and napkins together with the large black jack
which we have already mentioned and was one
or two steps on his way to the door the sinewy
arm the cavalier which seemed to elongate
itself on purpose as it extended far beyond the
folds the threadbare jacket arrested the progress
 the retiring ganymede and seizing on
woodstock 
the black jack conveyed it to the lips which were
gently breathing forth the aspiration d n
i mean heaven forgive me ewe are poor
creatures clay one modest sip must be permitted
to our frailty
so murmuring he glued the huge flagon to
his lips and as the head was slowly and gradually
inclined backwards in proportion as the
right hand elevated the bottom the pitcher
everard had great doubts whether the drinker
and the cup were likely to part until the whole
contents the latter had been transferred to the
person the former roger wildrake stinted
however when by a moderate computation he
had swallowed at one draught about a quart and
a half
he then replaced it on the salver fetched a
long breath to refresh his lungs bade the boy
get him gone with the rest the liquors in a
tone which inferred some dread his constancy
and then turning to his friend everard he expatiated
in praise moderation observing that
the mouthful which he had just taken had been
 more service to him than if he had remained
sc woodstock
quaffing healths at table for four hours together

his friend made no reply but could not help
being privately opinion that wildrakes temperance
had done as much execution on the tankard
in his single draught as some more moderate
topers might have effected if they had sat
sipping for an evening but the subject was
changed by the entrance the landlord who
came to announce to his honour colonel everard
that the worshipful mayor woodstock
with the rev master holdenough were come
to wait upon him
woodstock s
chapter x
 here have we one head
upon two bodies your twoheaded bullock
is but an ass to such a prodigy
these two have but one meaning thought and counsel 
and when the single noddle has spoke out
the four legs scrape assent to it
old play
in the goodly form the honest mayor there
was a bustling mixture importance and embarrassment
like the deportment a man who was
conscious that he had an important part to act
if he could but exactly discover what that part
was but both were mingled with much pleasure
at seeing everard and he frequently repeated
his welcomes and allhails before he could be
brought to attend to what that gentleman said in
reply
good worthy colonel you are indeed a desirable
sight to woodstock at all times being as
i may say almost our townsman as you have
 woodstock
tlwelt so much and so long at the palace truly
the matter begins almost to pass my wit though
i have transacted the affairs this borough for
many a long day and you are come to my assistance
like like
tanquam deus ex machina as the ethnic
poet hath it said master holdenough although
i do not often quote from such books
master markham everard or worthy
colonel as i ought rather to say you are simply
the most welcome man who has come to
woodstock since the days old king harry
 i had some business with you my good
friend said the colonel addressing the mayor
i shall be glad if it should so happen at the
same time that i may find occasion to pleasure
you or your worthy pastor
 no question you can do so good sir interposed
master holdenough you have the heart
sir and you have the hand and we are much in
want good counsel and that from a man action
i am aware worthy colonel that you and
your worthy father have ever borne yourselves
in these turmoils like men a truly christian
and moderate spirit striving to pour oil into the
woodstock 
wounds the land which some would rub with
vitriol and pepper and we know you are faithful
children the church we have reformed
from its papistical and prelatical tenets
 my good and reverend friend said everard
 i respect the piety and learning many
 your teachers but i am also for liberty 
conscience to all men i neither side with sectaries
nor do i desire to see them the object 
suppression by violence
 sir sir said the presbyterian hastily all
this hath a fair sound but i would you should
think what a fine country and church we are like
to have it amidst the errors blasphemies and
schisms which are daily introduced into the
church and kingdom england so that worthy
master edwards in his gangrene declared that
our native country is about to become the very
sink and cesspool all schisms heresies blasphemies
and confusions as the army hannibal
was said to be the refuse au naiionscouuvies
omnium gentium believe me worthy colonel
that they the honourable house view all this
over lightly and with the winking connivance 
 woodstock
old eli these instructors the schismatics shoulder
the orthodox ministers out their pulpits
thrust themselves into families and break up the
peace thereof stealing away men's hearts from
the established faith
 my good master holdenough replied the
colonel interrupting the zealous preacher there
is ground sorrow for all these unhappy discords
 and i hold with you that the fiery spirits
 the present time have raised men's minds at
once above soberminded and sincere religion
and above decorum and common sense but
there is no help save patience enthusiasm is a
stream that may foam off in its own time whereas
it is sure to bear down every barrier which is
directly opposed to it but what are these schismatical
proceedings to our present purpose 
why partly this sir said holdenough
although perhaps you may make less it than
i should have thought before we met i was
myself i nehemiah holdenough he added
consequentially was forcibly expelled from my
own pulpit even as a man should have been
thrust out his own house by an alien and
 
woodstock 
an intruder a wolf who was not at the trouble
even to put on sheep's clothing but came in
his native wolfish attire buff and bandalier
and held forth in my stead to the people who
are to me as a flock to the lawful shepherd it
is too true sir master mayor saw it and strove
to take such order to prevent it as man might
though turning to the mayor i think still you
might have striven a little more
good now good master holdenough do not
let us go back on that question said the mayor
guy warwick or bevis hampton might
do something with this generation but truly
they are too many and too strong for the mayor
 woodstock
i think master mayor speaks very good
sense said the colonel if the independents
are not allowed to preach i fear me they will not
fight and then if you were to have another rising
 cavaliers 
there are worse folks may rise than cavaliers
said holdenough
how sir replied colonel everard let
vol i q
 woodstock
me remind you master holdenough that is no
safe language in the present state the nation
i say said the presbyterian there are
worse folks may rise than cavaliers and i will
prove what i say the devil is worse than the
worst cavalier that ever drunk a health or swore
an oath and the devil has arisen at woodstock
lodge 
ay truly hath he said the mayor bodily
and visibly in figure and form an awful
time we live in 
 gentlemen i really know not how i am to
understand you said everard
why it was even about the devil we came
to speak with you said the mayor but the
worthy minister is always so hot upon the sectaries

which are the devil's brats and nearly akin
to him said master holdenough but true it
is that the growth these sects has brought up
the evil one even upon the face the earth to
look after his own interest where he finds it most
thriving
master holdenough said the colonel if
woodstock 
you speak figuratively i have already told you
that i have neither the means nor the skill sufficient
to temper these religious heats but if you
design to say that there has been an actual apparition
 the devil i presume to think that you
with your doctrine and your learning would bea
fitter match for him than a soldier like me
true sir and i have that confidence in the
commission which i hold that i would take the
field against the foul fiend without a moment's
delay said holdenough but the place in
which he hath late appeared being woodstock
is filled with those dangerous and impious
persons whom i have been but now complaining
 and though i dare venture in disputation
with their great master himself yet without your
protection most worthy colonel i see not that
i may with prudence trust myself with the tossing
and goring ox desborough or the bloody
and devouring bear harrison or the cold and
poisonous snake bletson all whom are now
at the lodge doing license and taking spoil as
they think meet and as all men say the devil
has come to make a fourth with them
s woodstock
in good truth worthy and noble sir said
the mayor it is even as master holdenough
says our privileges are declared void our cattle
seized in the very pastures they talk cutting
down and dispersing the fair chase which has
been so long the pleasure so many kings and
making woodstock as little note as any paltry
village i assure you we heard your arrival
with joy and wondered at your keeping yourself
o close in your lodgings we know no one save
your father or you that are like to stand the
poor burgesses friend in this extremity since almost
all the gentry around are malignant and
under sequestration we trust therefore you
will make strong intercession in our behalf
 certainly master mayor said the colonel
who saw himself with pleasure anticipated it
was my very purpose to have interfered in this
matter and i did but keep myself alone until
i should be furnished with some authority from
the lord general
 powers from the lord general said the
mayor thrusting the clergyman with his elbow
 dost thou hear that what cock will fight
woodstock 
that cock we shall carry it now over their
neekfi and woodstock shall be brave woodstock
still 
 keep thine elbow from my side friends
said holdenough annoyed by the action which
the mayor had suited to his words and may
the lord send that cromwell prove not as sharp
to the people england as thy bones against
my person yet i approve that we should use
his authority to stop the course these men's
proceedings
let us set out then said colonel everard 
 and i trust we shall find the gentlemen reasonable
and obedient
the functionaries laic and clerical assented
with much joy and the colonel required and
received wildrake's assistance in putting on his
cloak and rapier as if he had been the dependant
whose part he acted the cavalier contrived
however while doing him these menial offices to
give his friend a shrewd pinch in order to maintain
the footing secret equality betwixt them
the colonel was saluted as they passed through
the streets by many the anxious inhabitants
j woodstock
who seemed to consider his intervention as affording
the only chance saving their fine park and
the rights the corporation as well as individuals
from ruin and confiscation
as they entered the park the colonel asked
his companions what is this you say apparitions
being seen amongst them 
 why colonel said the clergyman you
know yourself that woodstock was always haunted

i have lived therein many a day said the
colonel and i know that i never saw the
least sign it although idle people spoke the
house as they do all old mansions and gave
the apartments ghosts and spectres to fill up the
places the deceased great who had ever dwelt
there
nay but good colonel said the clergyman
i trust you have not reached the prevailing sin
 the times and become indifferent to the testimony
in favour apparitions which appears so
conclusive to all but atheists and advocates for
witches 
 i would not absolutely disbelieve what is so
woodstock 
generally affirmed said the colonel but my
temper leads me to doubt most the stories
which i have heard this sort and my own experience
never went to confirm any them
ay but trust me said holdenough there
was always a demon one or the other species
about this woodstock not a man or woman in
the town but has heard stories apparitions in
the forest or about the old castle sometimes it
is a pack hounds that sweep along and the
whoops and hollow the huntsman and the
winding horns and the galloping horse
which is heard as if first more distant and then
close around you and then anon it is a solitary
huntsman who asks if you can tell him which
way the stag has gone he is always dressed in
green but the fashion his clothes is some five
hundred years old this is what we call demon
meridian the noonday spectre
my worthy and reverend sir said the colonel
 i have lived at woodstock many seasons
and have traversed the chase at all hours trust
me what you hear from the villagers is the growth
 their idle folly and superstition
colonel replied holdenough a negative
 woodstock
proves nothing what signifies craving your
pardon that you have not seen anything be it
earthly or be it the other world to detract from
the evidence a score people who have 
and besides there is the demon nocturnal 
the being that walketh by night he has been
among these independents and schismatics last
night ay colonel you may stare but it is
even so they may try whether he will mend
their gifts as they profanely call them exposition
and prayer no sir i trow to master the
foul fiend there goeth some competent knowledge
 theology and an acquaintance with the humane
letters ay and a regular clerical education
and clerical calling
i do not in the least doubt said the colonel
 the efficacy your qualifications to lay the
devil but still i think some odd mistake has occasioned
this confusion amongst them if there
has any such in reality existed desborough is a
blockhead to be sure and harrison is fanatic
enough to believe anything but there is bletson
on the other hand who believes nothing 
what do you know this matter good master
mayor r
woodstock 
 in sooth and it was master bletson who gave
the first alarm replied the magistrate or at
least the first distinct one you see sir i was
in bed with my wife and no one else and i was
as fast asleep as a man can desire to be at two
hours after midnight when behold you they came
knocking at my bedroom door to tell me there
was an alarm in woodstock and that the bell 
the lodge was ringing at that dead hour the
night as hard as ever it rung when it called the
court to dinner
 well but the cause this alarm said the
colonel
 you shall hear worthy colonel you shall
hear answered the mayor waving his hand
with dignity for he was one those persons
who will not be hurried out their own pace
so mrs mayor would have persuaded me in
her love and affection poor wretch that to rise
at such an hour out my warm bed was like
to bring on my old complaint the lumbago and
that i should send the people to alderman button
 alderman devil mrs mayor said i 
i beg your reverence's pardon for using such a
 woodstock
phrase do you think i am going to lie abed
when the town is on fire and the cavaliers up
and the devil to pay i beg pardon again parson
but here we are before the gate the
palace will it not please you to enter 
i would first hear the your story
said the colonel that is master mayor if it
happens to have an 
 everything hath an said the mayor
 and that which we call a pudding hath two
your worship will forgive me for being facetious
where was i o i jumped out bed and
put on my red plush breeches with the blue nether
stocks for i always make a point being
dressed suitably to my dignity night and day
summer or winter colonel everard and i took
the constable along with me in case the alarm
should be raised by nightwalkers or thieves and
called up worthy master holdenough out his
bed in case it should turn out to be the devil
and so i thought i was provided for the worst
and so away we came and by and by the soldiers
who came to the town with master tompkins
who had been called to arms came marching
woodstock 
down to woodstock as fast as their feet would
carry them so i gave our people the sign to let
them pass us and outmarch us as it were and
this for a twofold reason
i will be satisfied interrupted the colonel
with one good reason you desired the redcoats
should have ther the fray
true sir very true and also that they
should have the last it in respect that fighting
is their especial business however we came on
at a slow pace as men who are determined to do
their duty without fear or favour when suddenly
we saw something white haste away up the
avenue towards the town when six our constables
and assistants fled at once as conceiving
it to be an apparition called the white woman
 woodstock
look you there colonel said master holdenough
 i told you there were demons more
kinds than one which haunt the ancient scenes 
royal debauchery and cruelty
 i hope you stood your own ground master
mayor said the colonel
i yes most assuredly that is i did not

sss woodstock
strictly speaking keep my ground but the townclerk
and i retreated retreated colonel and
without confusion or dishonour and took post behind
worthy master holdenough who with the
spirit a lion threw himself in the way the
supposed spectre and attacked it with such a
literary latin as might have scared the devil
himself and thereby plainly discovered that it
was no devil at all nor white woman neither
woman any colour but worshipful master breton
a member the house commons and
one the commissioners sent hither upon this
unhappy sequestration the wood chase and
lodge woodstock
and this was all you saw the demon 
said the colonel
truly yes answered the mayor and i
had no wish to see more however we conveyed
master bletson as in duty bound back to the
lodge and he was ever maundering by the way
how that he met a party scarlet devils incarnate
marching down to the lodge but to my poor
thinking it must have been the independent dragoons
who had just passed us
woodstock 
and more incarnate devils i would never
wish to see said wildrake who cour remain
silent no longer his voice so suddenly heard
showed how much the mayor's nerves were still
alarmed for he started and jumped aside with an
alacrity which no one would at first sight suppose
a man his portly dignity to have been
capable everard imposed silence on his intrusive
attendant and desirous to hear the conclusion
 this strange story requested the mayor
to tell him how the matter ended and whether
they stopped the supposed spectre
 truly worthy sir said the mayor master
holdenough was quite venturous upon confronting
as it were the devil and compelling
him to appear under the real form master
joshua bletson member parliament for the
borough littlefaith
in sooth master mayor said the divine i
were strangely ignorant my own commission
and its immunities if i were to value opposing
myself to satan or any independent in his likeness
all whom in the name him i serve
i do defy spit at and trample under my feet 
 woodstock
and because master mayor is something tedious
i will briefly inform your honour that we saw
little the enemy that night save what master
bletson said in the first feeling his terrors and
save what we might collect from the disordered
appearance the honourable colonel desborough
and majorgeneral harrison
and what plight were they in i pray you 
demanded the colonel 
why worthy sir every one might see with
half an eye that they had been engaged in a fight
wherein they had not been honoured with victory
seeing that general harrison was stalking
up and down the parlour with his drawn sword
in his hand talking to himself his doublet unbuttoned
his points untrussed his garters loose
and like to throw him down as he now and then
trod on them and gaping and grinning like a
mad player and yonder sate desborough with
a dry pottle sack before him which he had just
emptied and which though the element in which
he trusted had not restored him sense enough to
speak or courage enough to look over his shoulder
he had a bible in his hand forsooth as if it
woodstock 
would make battle against the evil one but i
peered over his shoulder and alas the good
gentleman held the bottom the page uppermost
it was as if one your musketeers noble
and valued sir were to present the butt 
his piece at the enemy instead the muzzle
ha ha ha it was a sight to judge schismatics
by both in point head and in point hearty
in point skill and in point courage oh 
colonel then was the time to see the true character
 an authorized pastor souls over those
unhappy men who leap into the fold without due
and legal authority and will forsooth preach
teach and exhort and blasphemously term the
doctrine the church saltless porridge and dry
chips
i have no doubt you were ready to meet the
danger reverend sir but i would fain know 
what nature it was and from whence it was to be
apprehended 
was it for me to make such inquiry said
the clergyman triumphantly is it for a brave
soldier to number his enemies or inquire from
what quarter they are to come no sir i was
u
i woodstock
there with match lighted bullet in my mouth
and my marquess shouldered to encounter as
many devils as hell could pour in were they
countless as motes in the sunbeam and came
from all points the compass the papists talk
 the temptation st anthony pshaw let
them double all the myriads which the brain a
crazy dutch painter hath invented and you will
find a poor presbyterian divine i will answer
for one at least who not in his own strength
but his masters will receive the assault in such
sort that far from returning against him as against
yonder poor hound day after day and night after
night he will at once pack them off as with
a vengeance to the uttermost parts assyria
still said the colonel i pray to know
whether you saw anything upon which to exercise
your pious learning 
saw answered the divine no truly i
saw nothing nor did i look for anything thieves
will not attack wellarmed travellers nor will devils
or evil spirits come against one who bears in
his bosom the word truth in the very language
in which it was first dictated no sir they shun
woodstock
a divine who can understand the holy text as a
crow is said to keep wide a gun loaded with
hailshot
they had walked a little way back upon their
road to give time for this conversation and the
colonel perceiving it was about to lead to no satisfactory
explanation the real cause alarm
on the preceding night turned round and observing
it was time they should go to the lodge
began to move in that direction with his three
companions
it was now becoming dark and the towers 
woodstock arose high above the umbrageous
shroud which the forest spread around the ancient
and venerable mansion from one the
highest turrets which could still be distinguished
as it rose against the clear blue sky there gleamed
a light like that a candle within the building
the mayor stopt short and catching fast
hold the divine and then colonel everard
exclaimed in a trembling and hasty but suppressed
tone do you see yonder light 
ray marry do i said colonel everard
sand what does that matter a light in a garvol
i r
sf woodstock
retroom such an old mansion as woodstock
is no subject for wonder i trow
but a light from rosamond's tower is surely
so said the mayor
true said the colonel something surprised
when after a careful examination he satisfied
himself that the worthy magistrate's conjecture
was real that is indeed rosamond's
tower and as the drawbridge by which it was
accessible has been destroyed for centuries it is
hard to say what chance could have lighted a
lamp in such an inaccessible place
that light burns with no earthly fuel said
the mayor neither from whale nor olive nor
beeswax nor muttonsuet either i dealt in
these commodities colonel before i went into
my present line and i can assure you i could
distinguish the sort light they give one from
another at a greater distance than yonder turret
look you that is no earthly flame see you
not something blue and reddish upon the edges 
that bodes full well where it comes from 
colonel in my opinion we had better go back to
sup at the town and leave the devil and the
woodstock 
redcoats to settle their matters together for tonight
and then when we come back the next
morning we will have a pull with the party that
chances to keep afield
you will do as you please master mayor
said everard but my duty requires me that i
should see the commissioners to night
and mine requires me to see the foul fiend
said master holdenough if he dare make himself
visible to me i wonder not that knowing
is approaching he betakes himself to the very
citadel the inner and the last defences this
ancient and haunted mansion he is dainty i
warrant you and must dwell where is a relish 
luxury and murder about the walls his chamber
in yonder turret sinned rosamond and
in yonder turret she suffered and there she sits
or more likely the enemy in her shape as i
have heard true men woodstock tell i wait
on you good colonel master mayor will do ashe
pleases the strong man hath fortified himself
in his dwellinghouse but lo there comes
another stronger than he
for me said the mayor who am as unwoodstock

learned as i am un warlike i will not engage either
with the powers the earth or the prince 
the powers the air and i will go back to
woodstock and hark ye good fellow slapping
wildrake on the shoulder i will bestow
on thee a shilling wet and a shilling dry if thou
wilt go with me
gadzojkers master mayor said wildrake
neither flattered by the magistrate's familiarity
 address nor captivated by his munificence
 i wonder who the devil made you
and nee fellows and besides do you think i
would go back to woodstock with your worshipful
codeshead when by good management i
may get a peep fair rosamond and see whether
she was that choice and incomparable piece 
ware which the world has been told by rhymers
and balladmakers 
speak less lightly and wantonly friend
said the divine we are to resist the devil that
he may flee from us and not to tamper with
him or enter into his counsels or traffic with the
merchandize his great vanity fair
mind what the good man says wildrake

woodstock 
said the colonel and take heed another time
how thou dost suffer thy wk to outrun discretion

i am beholden to the reverend gentleman
for his advice answered wildrake upon whose
tongue it was difficult to impose any curb whatever
even when his own safety rendered it most
desirable but gadzookers let him have had
what experience he will in fighting with the devil
he never saw one so black as i had a tussle
with not a hundred years ago
how friend said the clergyman who understood
everything literally when apparitions
were mentioned have you had so late a visitation
 satan believe me then that i wonder
why thou dearest to entertain his name so
often and so lightly as i see thou dost use it in
thy ordinary discourse but when and where
didst thou see the evil one 
everard hastily interposed lest by something
yet more strongly alluding to cromwell his imprudent
squire should in mere wantonness betray
his interview with the general the
young man raves he said a dream which
 woodstock
he had the other night when he and i slept together
in victor lee's chamber belonging to the
ranger's apartments at the lodges
thanks for help at a pinch good patron
said wildrake whispering into everard's ear
who in vain endeavoured to shake him off a
fib never failed a fanatic
you also spoke something too lightly 
these matters considering the work which we
have in hand worthy colonel said the presbyterian
divine believe me the young man
thy servant was more like to see visions than to
dream merely idle dreams in that apartment 
for i have always heard that next to rosamond's
tower in which as i said she played
the wanton and was after ward's poisoned by
queen eleanor victor lee's chamber was the
place in the lodge woodstock more peculiarly
the haunt evil spirits i pray you young
man tell me this dream or vision yours
with all my heart sir said wildrake
then addressing his patron who began to interferes
he said tush sir you have had the discourse
for an hour send why should not i hold
woodstock 
forth in my turn by this darkness if you keep
me silent any longer i will turn independent
preacher and stand up in your despite for the
freedom private judgment and so reverend
sir i was dreaming a carnal advertisement called
a bullbaiting and methought there were
venturing dogs at head as merrily as e'er i saw
them at tutburybullrunning and methought
i heard some one say there was the devil come to
have a sight the bullring well i thought that
gad swoons i would have a peep at his infernal
majesty so i looked and there was a butcher in
greasy woollen with his steel by his side but he
was none the devil and there was a drunken
cavalier with his mouth full oaths and his
stomach full emptiness and a goldlaced waistcoat
in a very dilapidated condition and a ragged
hat with a piece a feather in it and he
was none the devil neither and here was a
miller his hands dusty with meal and every
atom it stolen and there was a vintner his
green apron stained with wine and every drop
 it sophisticated but neither was the old gentleman
i looked for to be detected among those
 woodstock
artizans iniquity at length sir i saw r
grave person with cropped hair a pair longish
and projecting ears a band as broad as a slobbering
bib under his chin a brown coat surmounted
by a geneva cloak and i had old
nicholas at once in his genuine paraphernalia
by 
 shame shame said colonel everard
what behave thus to an old gentleman and a
divine 
nay let him proceed said the minister with
perfect equanimity if thy friend or secretary
is gibing i must have less patience than becomes
my profession if i could not bear an idle
jest and forgive him who makes it or if on
the other hand the enemy has really presented
himself to the young man in such a guise ashe
intimates wherefore should we be surprised

reverend sir i crave you a thousand pardons
said wildrake penetrated by the quietness and
patience the presbyter's rebuke by st
george if quiet patience will do it thou art fit
to play a game at foils with the devil himself
and i would be contented to hold stakes
as he concluded an apology which was certainly
not uncalled for and seemed to be received
in perfectly good part they approached so
close to the exterior door the lodge that they
were challenged with the emphatic stand by a
sentinel who mounted guard there colonel
everard replied a friend and the sentinel repeating
his command stand friend proceeded
to call the corporal the guard the corporal
came forth and at the same time turned
out his guard colonel everard gave his name
and designation as well as those his companions
on which the corporal said he doubted
not there would be orders for his instant admission
but in the first place mr tomkins

must be consulted that he might learn their

 how sir said the colonel do you
knowing who i am presume to keep me on the

not if your honour pleases to enter said
the corporal and undertakes to be my warranty
 but such are the orders my post
nay then do your duty said the colonel 
but are the cavaliers up or what is the matter
that you keep so close and strict a watch 
the fellow gave no distinct answer but muttered
between his moustaches something about
the enemy and the roaring lion who goeth
about seeking what he may devour presently
afterwards tomkins appeared followed by two
servants bearing lights in great standing brass
candlesticks they marched before colonel everard
and his party keeping as close to each other
as two cloves the same orange and starting
from time to time and shouldering as they passed
through sundry intricate passages they led
up a large and ample wooden staircase the banisters
rail and lining which were executed

in black oak and finally into a long saloon or
parlour where there was a prodigious fire and
about twelve candles the largest size distributed
in sconces against the wall there were seated
the commissioners who now held in their power

the bloody bear an independent beast
unlocked to forms in groans he had express'd
next him the bassoon ape as atheists use
mimick'd all sects and had his own to choose
hind and panther
the strong light in the parlour which we have
described served to enable everard easily to recognise
his acquaintances desborough harrison
and bletson who had assembled themselves round
an oak table large dimensions placed near the
blazing chimney on which were arranged wine
and ale and materials for smoking then the general
indulgence the time there was a species
 movable cupboard set betwixt the table and
the door calculated originally for a display 
plate upon grand occasions but at present only
used as a screen which purpose it served so effect
actually
that ere he had coasted around it everard
heard the following fragment what desborough
was saying in his coarse strong voice 
sent him to share with us fse warrant ye it
was always his excellency my brotherinlaw's
way if he made a treat for five friends he would
invite more than the table could hold i have
known him ask three men to eat two eggs
hush hush said bletson and the servants
making their appearance from behind the tall cupboard
announced colonel everard it may not
be unpleasing to the reader to have a description
 the party into which he now entered
desborough was a stout bullnecked man 
middle size with heavy vulgar features grizzled
bushy eyebrows and walleyes the flourish
 his powerful relative's fortunes had burst
forth in the finery his dress which was much
more ornamented than was usual among the roundheads
there was embroidery on his cloak and
lace upon his band his hat displayed a feather
with a golden clasp and all his habiliments were
those a cavalier or follower the court rather
than the plain dress a parliamentarian officer
s woodstock
but heaven knows there was little courtlike
grace or dignity in the person or demeanour 
the individual who became his fine suit as the
hog on the signpost does his gilded armour it
was not that he was positively deformed or misshaped
for taken in detail the figure was well
enough but his limbs seemed to act upon different
and contradictory principles they were
not as the play says in a concatenation accordingly
 the right hand moved as if it were upon
bad terms with the left and the legs showed an inclination
to foot it in different and opposite directions
in short to use an extravagant comparison
the members colonel desborough seemed
rather to resemble the disputatious representatives
 a federative congress than the wellordered
union the orders the state in a firm and
wellcompacted monarchy where each holds his
own place and all obey the dictates a common
head
general harrison the second the commissioners
was a tall thin middleaged man who
had risen into his high situation in the army
and his intimacy with cromwell by his dauntless
woodstock 
courage in the field and the popularity he had
acquired by his exalted enthusiasm amongst the
military saints sectaries and independents who
composed the strength the existing army harrison
was mean extraction and bred up to his
father's employment a butcher nevertheless
his appearance though coarse was not vulgar like
that desborough who had so much the advantage
 him in birth and education he had
as we have said a masculine height and strength
 figure was well made and in his manner announced
a rough military character which might
be feared but could not be the object contempt
or ridicule his aquiline nose and dark black
eyes set off to some advantage a countenance
otherwise irregular and the wild enthusiasm that
sometimes sparkled in them as he dilated on his
opinions to others and often seemed to slumber
under his long dark eyelashes as he mused upon
them himself gave something strikingly wild and
even noble to his aspect he was one the chief
leaders those who were called fifthmonarchy
men who going even beyond the usual fanaticism
 the age presumptuously interpreted the
s woodstock
 the revelations after their own fancies
considered that the second advent the messiah
and the millennium or reign the saints
upon earth was close at hand and that they
themselves illuminated as they believed with the
power foreseeing these approaching events were
the choice instruments for the establishment the
new reign or fifth monarchy as it was called
and were fated also to win its honours whether
celestial or terrestrial
when this spirit enthusiasm which operated
like a partial insanity was not immediately
affecting harrison's mind he was a shrewd worldly
man and a good soldier one who missed no
opportunity mending his fortune and who in
expecting the exaltation the fifth monarchy
was in the meanwhile a ready instrument for the
establishment the lord generals supremacy
whether it was owing to his early occupation
and habits indifference to pain or bloodshed
to natural disposition and want feeling or
finally to the awakened character his enthusiasm
which made him look upon those who opposed
him as opposing the divine will and therefore
woodstock 
meriting no favour or mercy is not easy to say
but all agreed that after a victory or the successful
storm a town harrison was one the
most cruel and pitiless men in cromwelps army 
always urging some misapplied text to authorize
the continued execution the fugitives and sometimes
even putting to death those who had surrendered
themselves prisoners it was said that at
times the recollection some those cruelties
troubled his conscience and disturbed the dreams
 beatification in which his imagination indulged
when everard entered the apartment this
true representative the fanatical soldiers the
day who filled those ranks and regiments which
cromwell had politically kept on foot while he
procured the reduction those in which the presbyterian
interest predominated was seated a little
apart from the others his legs crossed and stretched
out at length towards the fire his head resting
on his elbow and turned upwards as if studying
with the most profound gravity the halfseen
carving the gothic roof
bletson remains to be mentioned who in person
and figure was diametrically different from
vol i i
 woodstock
the other two there was neither foppery nor
slovenliness in his exterior nor had he any
marks military service or rank about his person
a small walking rapier seemed merely worn
as a badge his rank as a gentleman without
his hand having the least purpose becoming
acquainted with the hilt or his eye with the blade
his countenance was thin and acute marked with
lines which thought rather than age had traced
upon it and a habitual sneer on his countenance
even when he least wished to express contempt on
his features seemed to assure the person addressed
that in bletson he conversed with a person 
intellect far superior to his own this was a triumph
 intellect only for on all occasions difference
respecting speculative opinions and indeed
on all controversies whatsoever bletson
avoided the ultimate ratio blows and knocks
yet this peaceful gentleman had found himself
obliged to serve personally in the parliamentary
army at the commencement the civil war till
happening unluckily to come in contact with the
fiery prince rupert his retreat was judged so
precipitate that it required all the shelter his
woodstock befriends
could afford to keep him free an impeachment
or a courtmartial but as bletson spoke welland
with great effect in the house commons
which was his natural sphere and was on that account
high in the estimation his party his behaviour
at edgehill was passed over and he continued
to take an active share in all the political
events that bustling period though he faced
not again the actual front war
bletsons theoretical principles politics had
long inclined him to espouse the opinions 
harrison and others who adopted the visionary
idea establishing a pure democratical republic
in so extensive a country as britain this was a
rash theory where there is such an infinite difference
betwixt ranks habits education and morals
where there is such an immense disproportion
betwixt the wealth individuals and where a
large proportion the inhabitants consists the
inferior classes the large towns and manufacturing
districts men unfitted to bear that share
in the direction a state which must be exercised
by the members a republic in the proper
sense the word accordingly so soon as
woodstock
the experiment was made it became obvious that
no such form government could be adopted
with the smallest chance stability and the
question came only to be whether the remnant
or as it was vulgarly called the rump the
long parliament now reduced by the seclusion
 so many the members to a few scores 
persons should continue in spite their unpopularity
to rule the affairs britain whether
they should cast all loose by dissolving themselves
and issuing writs to convoke a new parliament
the composition which no one could answer for
any more than for the measures they might take
when assembled or lastly whether cromwell
as actually happened was not to throw the sword
into the balance and boldly possess himself 
that power which the remnant the parliament
were unable to hold and yet afraid to resign 
such being the state parties the council 
state in distributing the good things in their
gift endeavoured to soothe and gratify the army
as a beggar flings crusts to a growling mastiff
in this view desborough had been created
a commissioner in the woodstock matter to gras

tiny cromwell harrison to soothe the fierce fifthmonarchy
men and bletson as a sincere republican
and one their own leaven
but if they supposed bletson had the least intention
 becoming a martyr to his republicanism
or submitting to any serious loss on account it
they much mistook the man he entertained their
principles sincerely and not the less that they were
found impracticable for the miscarriage his
experiment no more converts the political speculator
than the explosion a retort undeceives an
alchemist but bletson was quite prepared to submit
to cromwell or any one else who might be possessed
 the actual authority he was a ready
subject in practice to the powers existing and made
little difference betwixt various kinds government
holding in theory all to be nearly equal in
imperfection so soon as they diverged from the
model harrington's oceana cromwell had already
been tampering with him like wax between
his finger and thumb and which he was ready
shortly to seal with smiling at the same time to
himself when he beheld the council state giving
rewards to bletson as their faithful adherent while
 woodstock
he himself was secure his allegiance how soon
soever the expected change government should
take place
but bletson was still more attached to his metaphysical
than his political creed and carried his
doctrines the perfectibility mankind as far ashe
did those respecting the conceivable perfection 
a model government and as in the one case he
declared against all power which did not emanate
from the people themselves so in his moral speculations
he was unwilling to refer any the phenomena
 nature to a final cause when pushed
indeed very hard bletson was compelled to mutter
some inarticulate and unintelligible doctrines
concerning an animus mundi or creative power
in the works nature by which she originally
called into existence and still continues to preserve
her works to this power he said some the purest
metaphysicians rendered a certain degree 
homage nor was he himself inclined absolutely to
censure those who by institution holidays choral
dances songs and harmless feasts and libations
might be disposed to celebrate the great goddess
nature at least dancing singing feasting and
woodstock 
sporting being comfortable things to both young
and old they might as well sport dance and feast
in honour such appointed holidays as under any
other pretext but then this moderate show religion
was to be practised under such exceptions
as are admitted by the highgate oath and no one
was to be compelled to dance drink sing or feast
whose taste did not happen to incline them to
such advertisements nor was any one to be compelled
to worship the creative power whether under
the name the animus mundi or any other
whatsoever the interference the deity in the
affairs mankind he entirely disowned having
proved to his own satisfaction that the idea originated
entirely in priestcraft in short with the
shadowy metaphysical exception aforesaid mr
joshua bletson darlington member for littlecreed
came as near the predicament an atheist
as it is perhaps possible for a man to do but
we say this with the necessary salvo for we have
known many like bletson whose curtains have
been shrewdly shaken by superstition though their
fears were unsanctioned by any religious faith
the devils we are assured believe and tremble 
 woodstock
but on earth there are many who in worse plight
than even the natural children perdition tremble
without believing and fear even while they blaspheme

it follows course that nothing could be
treated with more scorn by mr bletson than the
debates about prelacy and presbytery about presbytery
and independency about quakers and anabaptists
muggletonians and brownish and all the
various sects by which the civil war had commenced
and by which its dissensions were still continued
 it was he said as if beasts burthen
should quarrel amongst themselves about the
fashion their halters and packsaddles instead
 embracing a favourable opportunity throwing
them aside other witty and pithy remarks he
used to make when time and place suited for instance
at the club called the rota frequented by
saint john and established by harrington for the
free discussion political and religious subjects
but when bletson was out this academy or
stronghold af philosophy he was very cautious how
he carried his contempt the general prejudice in
favour religion and christianity further than
woodstock 
an implied objection or a sneer if he hm an opportunity
 talking in private with an ingenuous
and intelligent youth he sometimes attempted to
make a proselyte and showed much address in
bribing the vanity inexperience by suggesting
that a mind like his ought to spurn the prejudices
impressed upon it in childhood and when assuming
the latus clavus reason assuring him
that such as he laying aside the bulla juvenile
incapacity as bletson called it should proceed to
examine and decide for himself it frequently happened
that the youth was induced to adopt the
doctrines in whole or in part the sage who had
seen his natural genius and who had urged him
to exert it in examining detecting and declaring
for himself and thus flattery gave proselytes to
infidelity which could not have been gained by
all the powerful eloquence or artful sophistry 
the infidel
these attempts to extend the influence what
was called freethinking and philosophy were carried
on as we have hinted with a caution dictated
by the timidity the philosopher's disposition
he was conscious his doctrines were
 woodstock
suspected and his proceedings watched by the
two principal sects relations and presbyterians
who however inimical to each other were still more
hostile to one who was an opponent not only to a
church establishment any kind but to every
denomination christianity he found it more
easy to shroud himself among the independents
whose demands were for a general liberty conscience
or an unlimited toleration and whose faith
differing in all respects and particulars was by
some pushed into such wild errors as to get totally
beyond the bounds every species christianity
and approach very near to infidelity itself as extremes
 each kind are said to approach each
other bletson mixed a good deal among those
sectaries and such was his confidence in his own
logic and address that he is supposed to have entertained
hopes bringing to his opinions in time
the enthusiastic vane as well as the no less enthusiastic
hanson providing he could but get
them to resign their visions a fifth monarchy
and induce them to be contented with a reign 
philosophers in england for the natural period
 their lives instead the reign the saints
kiing the millennium
woodstock 
such was the singular group into which everard
was now introduced showing in their various
opinions upon how many devious coasts human
nature may make shipwreck when she has one e
let go her hold on the anchor which religion has
given her to lean upon the acute selfconceit and
worldly learning bletson the rash and ignorant
conclusions the fierce and underbred harrison
leading them into the opposite extremes enthusiasm
and infidelity while desborough constitutionally
stupid thought nothing about religion at
all and while the others were active in making
sail on different but equally erroneous courses
he might be said to perish like a vessel which
springs a leak and founders in the roadstead it
was wonderful to behold what a strange variety
 mistakes and errors on the part the king and
his ministers on the part the parliament and
their leaders on the part the allied kingdoms 
scotland and england towards each other had
combined to rear up men such dangerous opinions
and interested characters among the arbiters
 the destiny britain
those who argue for party's sake will sec all the
 vood stock
faults on the olio side without deigning to look at
those on the other those who study history for
instruction will perceive that nothing but the want
 concession on either side and the deadly height
to which the animosity the king's and parliaments
parties had arisen could have so totally
overthrown the wellpoised balance the english
constitution but we hasten to quit political reflections
the rather that ours we believe will
please neither whig nor tory

mb bletson arose and paid his respects to
colonel everard with the ease and courtesy a
gentleman the time though on every account
grieved at his intrusion as a religious man who
held his free thinking principles in detestation and
would effectually prevent his conversion harrison
and even desborough if anything could be
moulded out such a clod to the worship the
animus mundi moreover bletson knew everard
to be a man steady probity and by no
means disposed to close with a scheme on which
he had successfully sounded the other two and
which was calculated to assure the commissioners
 woodstock
 some little private indemnification for the trouble
they were to give themselves in the public business
the philosopher was yet less pleased when
he saw the magistrate and the pastor who had met
him in his flight the preceding evening when
he had been seen parma non bene 'elicta with
cloak and doublet left behind him
the presence colonel everard was as unpleasing
to desborough as to bletson but the
former having no philosophy in him nor an idea
that it was possible for any man to resist helping
himself out untold money was chiefly embarrassed
by the thought that the plunder which they
might be able to achieve out their trust might
by this unwelcome addition to their number be
divided into four parts instead three and this
reflection added to the natural awkwardness with
which he grumbled forth a sort welcome addressed
to everard
as for harrison he remained like one on
higher thoughts intent his posture unmoved his
eyes fixed on the ceiling as before and no part 
him indicated the least consciousness that the company
had been more than doubled around him
 woodstock 
meantime everard took his place at the table
as a man who assumed his own right and
pointed to his companions to sit down nearer the
foot the board wildrake so far misunderstood
his signals as to sit down above the mayor 
but rallying his recollection at a look from his
patron he rose and took his place lower whistling
however as he went a sound at which the
company stared as at a freedom highly unbecoming
to complete his indecorum he seized
upon a pipe and filling it from a large tobaccobox
was soon immersed in a cloud his own
raising from which a hand shortly after emerged
seized on the blackjack ale withdrew it within
the vapoury sanctuary and after a potential
draught replaced it upon the table its owner beginning
to renew the cloud which his intermitted
exercise the tube had almost allowed to subside

nobody made any observation on his conduct
out respect probably to colonel everard who
bit his lip but continued silent aware that censure
might extract something more unequivocally chains
woodstock 
racteristic a cavalier from his refractory companion
as silence seemed too awkward and the
others made no advances to break it beyond the
ordinary salutation colonel everard at length
said i presume gentlemen that you are somewhat
surprised at my arrival here and thus intruding
myself into your meeting
why the dickens should we be surprised
colonel said desborough we know his excellency
my brotherinlaw noll's i mean my
lord cromwell's way overquartering his menin
the towns he marches through thou hast
obtained a share in our commission 
and in that's said bletson smiling and bowing
 the lordgeneral has given us the most
acceptable colleague that could have been added
to our number no doubt your authority for joining
with us must be under warrant the council
 state 
 that gentlemen said the colonel i
will presently advise you he took omit his
warrant accordingly and was about to communicate
the contents but observing that there were
three or four halfempty flasks upon the table
 woodstock sj
that defiborough looked more stupid than usual
and that the philosopher's eyes were reeling in
his head notwithstanding the temperance 
bletson's usual habits he concluded that they
had been fortifying themselves against the horrors
 the haunted mansion by laying in a store
 what is called dutch courage and therefore
prudently'resolved to postpone his more important
business with them till the cooler hour morning
he therefore instead presenting the general's
warrant superseding their commission contented
himself with replying my business
has course some reference to your proceedings
here but here is excuse my curiosity 
a reverend gentleman pointing to holdenough
who has told me that you are so strangely embarrassed
here as to require both the civil and
spiritual authority to enable you to keep possession
 woodstock
before we go into that matter said bletson
blushing up to the eyes at the recollection his
own fears so manifestly displayed yet so inconsistent
with his principles i should like to know
who this other stranger is who has come with the
vol i t
 woodstock 
worthy magistrate and the no less worthy presbyterians

meaning me said wildrake laying his
pipe aside gadzooks the time hath been that
i could have answered the question with a better
title but at present i am only his honour's peer
clerk or secretary whichever is the current
phrase
fore george my lively blade thou art a frank
fellow thy tattle said desborough there is
my secretary tomkins whom men sillily enough
call gibbet and the honourable lieutenant general
harrison's secretary bibbet who are now at
supper below stairs that durst not for their ears
speak a phrase above their breath in the presence
 their betters unless to answer a question
yes colonel everard said the philosopher
with his quiet smile glad apparently to divert
the conversation from the topic last night's
alarm and recollections which humbled his selflove
and selfsatisfaction yes and when master
bibbet and master bibbet do speak their affirmations
are as much in a common mould mutual
attestation as their names would accord m the
j
i
woodstock 
verses a poet if master gibbet happens to tell
a fiction master bibbet swears it as truth if
master bibbet chances to have gotten drunk in
the fear the lord master gibbet swears he is
sober i have called my own secretary gibbet
though his name chances to be only gibeon a
worthy israelite at your service but as pure a
youth as ever picked a lambbone at paschal but
i call him gibbet merely to make up the holy
trefoil with another rhyme this squire thine
colonel everard looks as if he might be worthy
to be coupled with the rest the fraternity
not i truly said the cavalier i'll be
coupled with no jew that was ever whelped and
no jewess neither
 scorn not for that young man said the philosopher
 the jews are in point religion
the elder brethren you know
the jews older than the christians said
desborough fore george they will have thee
before the general assembly bletson if thou
ventures to say so
wildrake laughed without ceremony at the
gross ignorance desborough and was joined by
 woodstock
a smuggling response from behind the cupboard
which when inquired into proved to be produced
by the servingmen these worthies timorous as
their betters when they had set down the lights
and were supposed to have left the room had only
absconded behind their present place concealment

how now ye rogues said bletson angrily 
do you not know your duty better 
we beg your worthy honour's pardon said
one the men but we had set the candlesticks
down on the table and truly we dared not go
down stairs till we should get a light
a light ye cowardly poltroons said the
philosopher what to show which you looks
palest when a rat squeaks but take a candlestick
and begone you cowardly villains the devils
you are so much afraid must be but paltry
kites if they hawk at such bats as you are
the servants without replying took up one 
the candlesticks and prepared to retreat trusty
tomkins at the head the troop when suddenly
as they arrived at the door the parlour which
had been left half open it was shut violently
woodstock 
the three terrified domestics tumbled back into
the middle the room as if a shot had been discharged
in their face and all who were at the table
started to their feet
colonel everard was incapable a moment's
fear even if anything frightful had been seen 
but he remained stationary to see what his companions
would do and to get at the bottom if possible
 the cause their alarm upon an occasion
so trifling the philosopher seemed to think that
he was the person chiefly concerned to show manhood
on the occasion
he walked to the door accordingly murmuring
at the cowardice the servants but at such a
snails pace that it seemed he would most willingly
have been anticipated by any one whom his
reproaches had roused to exertion cowardly
blockheads he said at last seizing hold the
handle the door but without turning it effectually
round dare you not open a door 
still fumbling with the lock dare you not go
down a staircase without a light here bring
me the candle you cowardly villains by heaven
something sighs on the outside 
 woodstock
as he spoke he let go the handle the parlour
door and stepped back a pace or two into the
apartment with cheeks as pale as the band he
wore
deus adductor mens r said the presbyterian
clergyman rising from his seat give place
sir addressing bletson it would seem i know
more this matter than thou and i bless heaven
i am armed for the conflict
bold as a grenadier about to mount a breach
yet with the same belief in the existence a great
danger to be encountered as well as the same reliance
in the goodness his cause the worthy man
stepped before the philosophical bletson and taking
a light from a sconce in one hand quietly
opened the door with the other and standing in
the threshold said here is nothing i
and who expected to see anything said
bletson excepting those terrified oafs who take
fright at every puff wind that whistles through
the passages this old dungeon 
mark you master tomkins said one the
waitingmen in a whisper to the steward see
how boldly the minister pressed forward before
woodstock 
all them ah master tomkins our parson is
the real commissioned officer the church your
laypreachers are no better than a parcel clubmen
and volunteers
follow me those who list said master holdenough
or go before me those who choose i
will walk through the habitable places this house
before i leave it and satisfy myself whether satan
hath really mingled himself among these dreary
dens ancient wickedness or whether like the
wicked whom holy david speaketh we are
afraid and flee when no one pursued
harrison who had heard these words sprung
from his seat and drawing his sword exclaimed
were there as many fiends in the house as there
are hairs on my head upon this cause i will charge
them up to their very trenches 
so saying he brandished his weapon and pressed
to the head the column where he moved side
by side with the minister the mayor woodstock
next joined the body thinking himself safer
perhaps in the company his pastor and the
whole train moved forward in close order accompanied
by the servants bearing lights to search
woodstock
the lodge for some cause that panic with which
they seemed to be suddenly seized
nay take me with you my friends said
colonel everard who had looked on in surprise
and was now about to follow the party when bletson
laid hold on his cloak and begged him to remain

you see my good colonels he said affecting
a courage which his shaking voice belied
here are only you and i and honest lesbos
left behind in garrison while all the others
are absent on a sally we must not hazard the
whole troops in one sortie that were unmilitary
ha ha ha i
in the name heaven what means all this 
said everard i heard a foolish tale about apparitions
as i came this way and now i find you
all half mad with fear and cannot get a word 
sense among so many you fie colonel desborough
 fie master bletson try to compose
yourselves and let me know in heaven's name
the cause all this disturbance one would be
apt to think your brains were turned
 and so mine well may said desborough
woodstock 
 ay and overturned too since my bed last night
was turned upside down and i was placed for ten
minutes heels uppermost and head downcast like
a bullock going to be shod
what means this nonsense master bletson 
desborough must have had the nightmare
 no faith colonel the goblins or whatever
else they were had been favourable to honest desborough
for they reposed the whole his person
on that part his body which hark did you
not hear something sis the central point gravity
namely his head
did you see anything to alarm you said
the colonel
nothing said bletson but we heard hellish
noises as all our people did and i believing
little ghosts and apparitions concluded the cavaliers
were taking us at advantage so remembering
gainsborough's fate i e'en jumped the
window and ran to woodstock to call the soldiers
to the rescue harrison and desborough
and did you not first go to see what the danger
was 
 ah my good friend you forget that i laid
woodstock
down my commission at the time the selfdenying
ordinance it would have been quite inconsistent
with my duty as a parliamentman to be
brawling amidst a set ruffians with any military
authority no when the parliament commanded
me to sheathe my sword colonel i have too
much veneration for their authority to be found
again with it drawn in my hand
but the parliament said desborough hastily
 did not command you to use your heels
when your hands could have saved a man from
choking gods dickens you might have stopped
when you saw my bed canted heels uppermost
and me half stifled in the bedclothes you might
i say have stopped and lent a hand to put it to
rights instead jumping out window like a
new shorn sheep so soon as you had run across
my room
nay worshipful master desborough said
bletson winking on everard to show that he was
playing on his thickskulled colleague how could
i tell your particular mode reposing there
are many tastes i have known men who slept by
choice on a slope or angle fortyfives
woodstock 
yes but did ever a man sleep standing on
his head except by miracle said desborough
 now as to miracles said the philosopher
confident in the presence everard besides that
an opportunity scoffing at religion really in some
degree diverted his fear i leave these out 
the question seeing that the evidence on such
subjects seems as little qualified to carry conviction
as a horsehair to land a leviathan
a loud clap thunder or a noise as formidable
rang through the lodge as the scoffer had
ended which struck him pale and motionless and
made desborough throw himself on his knees and
repeat exclamations and prayers in much admired
confusion
there must be contrivance here exclaimed
everard and snatching one the candles from
a sconce he rushed out the apartment little
heeding the entreaties the philosopher who in
the extremity his distress conjured him by the
animus mundi to remain to the assistance a
distressed philosopher endangered by witches
and a parliamentman assaulted by ruffians as
for desborough he only gaped like a clown in a
 woodstock
pantomime and doubtful whether to follow or
stop his natural indolence prevailed and he sat
still
when on the landingplace the stairs everard
paused a moment to consider which was the
best course to take he heard the voices men
talking fast and loud like people who wish to drown
their fears in the lower story and aware that nothing
could be discovered by those whose inquiries
were conducted in a manner so noisy he resolved
to proceed in a different direction and examine
the second floor which he had now gained
he had known every corner both the inhabited
and uninhabited part the mansion
and availed himself the candle to traverse two
or three intricate passages which he was afraid
he might not remember with sufficient accuracy
this movement conveyed him to a sort oeuil
debeiif an octagon vestibule or small hall from
which various rooms opened amongst these
doors everard selected that which led to a very
long narrow and dilapidated gallery built in the
time henry viii and running along the whole
southwest side the building communicating at
woodstock 
different points with the rest the mansion this
he thought was likely to be the post occupied by
those who proposed to act the sprites upon the occasion
 especially as its length and shape gave him
some idea that it was a spot where the bold thunder
might in many ways be imitated
determined to ascertain the truth if possible he
placed his light on a table in the vestibule and
applied himself to open the door into the gallery
at this point he found himself strongly opposed
either by a bolt drawn or as he rather conceived
by somebody from within resisting his attempt
he was induced to believe the latter because the
resistance slackened and was renewed like that 
human strength instead presenting the permanent
opposition an inanimate obstacle though
everard was a strong and active young man he
exhausted his strength in the vain attempt to open
the door and having paused to take breath was
about to renew his efforts with foot and shoulder
and to call at the same time for assistance when
to his surprise on again attempting the door more
gently in order to ascertain if possible where the
strength the opposing obstacle was situated he
i

found it give way to a very slight impulse some
impediment fell broken to the ground and the
door flew wide open the gust wind occasioned
by the sudden opening the door blew out
the candle and everard was left in darkness
save where the moonshine which the long siderow
 latticed windows dimmed could imperfectly
force its way into the gallery which lay in
ghostly length before him
the melancholy and doubtful twilight was increased
by a quantity creeping plants on the
outside which since all had been neglected in
these ancient halls now completely overgrown had
in some instances greatly diminished and in others
almost quite choked up the space the lattices
extending between the heavy stone shaftwork
which divided the windows both lengthways and
across on the other side there were no windows
at all and the gallery had been once completely
hung with paintings chiefly portraits by which
that side the apartment had been adorned
most the pictures had been removed yet the
empty frames some and the tattered remnants
 others were still visible along the extent 
woodstock sos
the waste gallery the look which was so desolate
and so well adapted besides for mischief
supposing there were enemies near him that everard
could not help pausing at the entrance and
recommending himself to god ere drawing his
sword he advanced into the apartment treading
as lightly as possible and keeping in the shadow
as much as he could
markham everard was by no means superstitious
but he had the usual credulity his times 
and though he did not yield easily to tales supernatural
visitations yet he could not help thinking
he was in the very situation where if such
things were ever permitted they might be expected
to take place while his own stealthy and
ill assured pace his drawn weapon and extended
arms being the very attitude and action doubt
and suspicion tended to increase in his mind the
gloomy feelings which they are the usual indications
and with which they are constantly associated
under such unpleasant impressions and
conscious the neighbourhood something unfriendly
colonel everard had already advanced
about half along the gallery when he heard some
y
 woodstock
one sigh very near him and a low soft voice pronounce
his name
here i am he replied while his heart beat
thick and short who calls on markham everard
t
another sigh was the only answer
 speak said the colonel whoever or whatsoever
you are and tell with what intent and purpose
you are lurking in these apartments 
with a better intent than yours returned
the soft voice
than mine answered everard in great
surprise who are you that dare judge my
intents 
what or who are you markham everard
who wander by moonlight through these deserted
halls royalty where none should be but those
who mourn their downfall or are sworn to avenge
it 
it is and yet it cannot be said everard 
yet it is and must be alice lee the devil or
you speaks answer me i conjure you speak
openly on what dangerous scheme are you engaged
 where is your father why are you here
woodstock 
wherefore do you run so deadly a venture 
speak i conjure you alice lee 
she whom you call on is at the distance 
miles from this spot what if her genius speaks
when she is absent what if the soul an ancestress
 hers and yours were now addressing
you what if 
nay answered everard but what if the
dearest human beings has caught a touch 
her father's enthusiasm what if she is exposing
her person to danger her reputation to
scandal by traversing in disguise and in darkness
a house filled with armed men speak tome
my fair cousin in your own person i am
furnished with powers to protect my uncle sir
henry to protect you too dearest alice even
against the consequences this visionary and
wild attempt speak i see where you are and
with all my respect i cannot submit to be thus
practised upon trust me trust your cousin
markham with your hand and believe that he
will die or place you in honourable safety
as he spoke he exercised his eyes as keenly as
possible to detect where the speaker stood and
vol i u
 woodstock
it seemed to him that about three ytirds from him
there was a shadowy form which he could not
discern even the outline placed as it was within the
deep and prolonged shadow thrown by a space 
wall intervening betwixt two windows upon that
side the room from which the light was admitted
he endeavoured to calculate as well as he
could the distance betwixt himself and the object
which he watched under the impression that if
by even using a slight degree compulsion he
could detach his beloved alice from the confederacy
into which he supposed her father's zeal for
the cause royalty had engaged her he would
be rendering them both the most essential favour
he could not indeed but conclude that however
successfully the plot which he conceived to be in
agitation had proceeded against the timid bletson
the stupid desborough and the crazy harrison
there was little doubt that at length their artifices
must necessarily bring shame and danger on those
engaged in it
it must also be remembered that everard's affection
to his cousin although the most respectful
and devoted character partook less the diswoodstock

want veneration which a lover those days entertained
for the lady whom he worshipped with
humble diffidence than the fond and familiar
feelings which a brother entertains towards a
younger sister whom he thinks himself entitled
to guide advise and even in some degree to control
so idndly and intimate had been their intercourse
that he had little more hesitation in endeavouring
to arrest her progress in the dangerous
course in which she seemed to be engaged even
at the risk giving her momentary offence than
he would have had in snatching her from a torrent
or conflagration at the chance hurting her by
the violence his grasp all this passed through
his mind in the course a single minute and he
resolved at all events to detain her on the spot
and compel if possible an explanation from her
with this purpose everard again conjured his
cousin in the name heaven to give up this idle
and dangerous mummery and lending an accurate
ear to her answer endeavoured from the sound
to calculate as nearly as possible the distance between
them
i am not she for whom you take me said
 woodstock
the voice and dearer regards than aught connected
with her life or death bid me warn you to
keep aloof and leave this place
not till i have convinced you your childish
folly said the colonel springing forward and
endeavouring to catch hold her who spoke to
him but no female form was within his grasp
on the contrary he was met by a shock which
could come from no woman's arm and which was
rude enough to stretch him on his back on the
floor at the same time he felt the point a
sword at his throat and his hands so completely
mastered that not the slightest defence remained
to him
 a cry for assistance said a voice near him
but not that which he had hitherto heard will be
stifled in your blood no harm is meant you 
be wise and be silent
the fear death which everard had often
braved in the field battle became more horrible
as he felt himself in the hands unknown assassins
and totally devoid all means defence
the sharp point the sword pricked his bare
throat and the foot him who held it was upon
woodstock 
his breast he felt it was to be a single thrust
and an there would be life and all the feverish
joys and sorrows which agitate us so strangely
and from which we are yet so reluctant to part
large drops perspiration stood upon his forehead
 this heart throbbed as if it would burst from
its confinement in the bosom she experienced the
agony which fear imposes on the brave man acute
in proportion to that which pain inflicts when it
subdues the robust and healthy
cousin alice he attempted to speak and
the sword's point pressed his throat yet more
closely cousin let me not be murdered in a
manner so fearful 
i tell you replied the voice that you
speak to one who is not here but your life is
not aimed at providing you swear on your faith
as a christian and your honour as a gentleman
that you will conceal what has happened whether
from the people below or from any other person
on this condition you may rise and if you seek
her you will find alice lee at joceline's cottage
in the forest
since i may not help myself otherwise said
 woodstock
everard i swear as i have a sense religion
and honour i will say nothing this violence
nor make any search after those who are concerned
in it
for that we care nothing said the voice
thou hast an example how well thou may'st
catch mischief on thy own part but we are incase
to defy thee bise and begone 
the foot the sword'spoint were withdrawn
and everard was about to start up hastily when
the voice in the same softness tone which distinguished
it at first said no haste cold and
bare steel is yet around thee now now snow
the words dying away as at a distance thou
art free be secret and be safe
markham everard arose and in rising embarrassed
his feet with his own sword which he
had dropped when springing forward as he supposed
to lay hold his fair cousin he snatched
it up in haste and as his hand clasped the hilt
his courage which had given way under the apprehension
 instant death began to return he
considered with almost his usual composure
what was to be done next deeply affronted at the
woodstock 
disgrace which he had sustained he questioned
for an instant whether he ought to keep his extorted
promise or should not rather summon assistance
and make haste to discover and seize
those who had been recently engaged in such violence
on his person but these persons be they
who they would had had his life in their power 
he had pledged his word in ransom it and
what was more he could not divest himself the
idea that his beloved alice was a confidante at
least if not an actor in the confederacy which
had thus baffled him this prepossession determined
his conduct for though angry at supposing
she must have been accessary to his personal
illtreatment he could not in any event think 
an instant search through the mansion which might
have committed her safety or that his uncle
but i will to the hut he said i will instantly
to the hut ascertain her share in this wild
and dangerous confederacy and snatch her from
ruin if it be possible
as under the influence the resolution which
he had formed everard groped his way through
the gallery and regained the vestibule he heard
 woodstock
his name called by the wellknown voice wild 
rake what ho houo colonel everard
mark everard it is dark as the devil's mouth
speak where are you the witches are keeping
their hellish sabbath here as i think where
are you 
here here answered everard cease
your bawling turn to the left and you will meet
me
guided by his voice wildrake soon appeared
with a light in one hand and his drawn sword in
the other where have you been i he said 
what has detained you here are bletson and
the brute desborough terrified out their lives
and harrison raving mad because the devil will
not be civil enough to rise to fight him
saw or heard you nothing as you came
along said everard
nothing said his friend excepting that
when i first entered this cursed ruinous labyrinth
the light was struck out my hand as if by a
switch which obliged me to return for another
i must come by a horse instantly wildrake
and another for thyself if it be possible
woodstock is
we can take two those belonging to the
troopers answered wildrake but for what
purpose should we run away like rats at this time
in the evening is the house falling 
i cannot answer you said the colonel pushing
forward into a room where there were some remains
 furniture
here the cavalier took a more strict view his
person and exclaimed in wonder what the
devil have you been fighting with markham that
has bedizened you after this sorry fashion 
fighting exclaimed everard
 yes replied his trusty attendant i say
fighting look at yourself in the mirror
he did and saw he was covered with dust and
blood the latter proceeded from a scratch which
he had received in the throat as he struggled to
extricate himself with unaffected alarm wildrake
undid his friend's collar and with eager
haste proceeded to examine the wound his hands
trembling and his eyes glistening with apprehension
for his benefactor's life when in spite 
everard's opposition he had examined the hurt
vol i x
 woodstock
and found it so trifling he resumed the natural
wildness his character perhaps the more readily
that he had felt shame in departing from it into
one which expressed more feeling than he would
be thought to possess
if that be the devils work mark said he
the foul fiend's claws are not nigh so formidable
as they are represented but no one shall say that
your blood has been shed unrevenged while roger
wildrake was by your side where left you
this same imp i will back to the field fight
confront him with my rapier and were his nails
tenpenny nails and his teeth as long as those 
a harrow he shall render me reason for the injury
he has done you
madness madness exclaimed everard 
i had this trifling hurt by a fall a basin and
towel will wipe it away meanwhile if you will ever
do me kindness get the troophorses command
them for the service the public in the name 
his excellency the general i will but wash and
join you in an instant before the gate
well i will serve you everard as a mute
serves the grand signior without knowing why
woodstock 
or wherefore but will you go without seeing
these people below 
without seeing any one said everard
lose no time for god's sake
he found out the noncommissioned officer
and demanded the horses in a tone authority to
which the corporal yielded undisputed obedience
as one well aware colonel everard's military
rank and consequence so all was in a minute or
two ready for the expedition

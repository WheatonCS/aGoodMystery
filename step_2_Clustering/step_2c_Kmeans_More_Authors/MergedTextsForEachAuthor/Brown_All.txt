chapter i


i sit down my friend to comply with thy request at length does the
impetuosity of my fears the transports of my wonder permit me to
recollect my promise and perform it at length am i somewhat delivered
from suspense and from tremors at length the drama is brought to an
imperfect close and the series of events that absorbed my faculties
that hurried away my attention has terminated in repose

till now to hold a steadfast pen was impossible to disengage my senses
from the scene that was passing or approaching to forbear to grasp at
futurity to suffer so much thought to wander from the purpose which
engrossed my fears and my hopes could not be

yet am i sure that even now my perturbations are sufficiently stilled
for an employment like this that the incidents i am going to relate can
be recalled and arranged without indistinctness and confusion that
emotions will not be reawakened by my narrative incompatible with order
and coherence yet when i shall be better qualified for this task i know
not time may take away these headlong energies and give me back my
ancient sobriety but this change will only be effected by weakening my
remembrance of these events in proportion as i gain power over words
shall i lose dominion over sentiments in proportion as my tale is
deliberate and slow the incidents and motives which it is designed to
exhibit will be imperfectly revived and obscurely portrayed

oh why art thou away at a time like this wert thou present the office
to which my pen is so inadequate would easily be executed by my tongue
accents can scarcely be too rapid or that which words should fail to
convey my looks and gestures would suffice to communicate but i know
thy coming is impossible to leave this spot is equally beyond my power
to keep thee in ignorance of what has happened would justly offend thee
there is no method of informing thee except by letter and this method
must i therefore adopt

how short is the period that has elapsed since thou and i parted and
yet how full of tumult and dismay has been my soul during that period
what light has burst upon my ignorance of myself and of mankind how
sudden and enormous the transition from uncertainty to knowledge

but let me recall my thoughts let me struggle for so much composure as
will permit my pen to trace intelligible characters let me place in
order the incidents that are to compose my tale i need not call on thee
to listen the fate of waldegrave was as fertile of torment to thee as
to me his bloody and mysterious catastrophe equally awakened thy grief
thy revenge and thy curiosity thou wilt catch from my story every
horror and every sympathy which it paints thou wilt shudder with my
foreboding and dissolve with my tears as the sister of my friend and
as one who honours me with her affection thou wilt share in all my
tasks and all my dangers

you need not be reminded with what reluctance i left you to reach this
place by evening was impossible unless i had set out early in the
morning but your society was too precious not to be enjoyed to the last
moment it was indispensable to be here on tuesday but my duty required
no more than that i should arrive by sunrise on that day to travel
during the night was productive of no formidable inconvenience the air
was likely to be frosty and sharp but these would not incommode one who
walked with speed a nocturnal journey in districts so romantic and wild
as these through which lay my road was more congenial to my temper
than a noonday ramble

by nightfall i was within ten miles of my uncle's house as the darkness
increased and i advanced on my way my sensations sunk into melancholy
the scene and the time reminded me of the friend whom i had lost i
recalled his features and accents and gestures and mused with
unutterable feelings on the circumstances of his death

my recollections once more plunged me into anguish and perplexity once
more i asked who was his assassin by what motives could he be impelled
to a deed like this waldegrave was pure from all offence his piety was
rapturous his benevolence was a stranger to remissness or torpor all
who came within the sphere of his influence experienced and acknowledged
his benign activity his friends were few because his habits were timid
and reserved but the existence of an enemy was impossible

i recalled the incidents of our last interview my importunities that he
should postpone his ill-omened journey till the morning his
inexplicable obstinacy his resolution to set out on foot during a dark
and tempestuous night and the horrible disaster that befell him

the first intimation i received of this misfortune the insanity of
vengeance and grief into which i was hurried my fruitless searches for
the author of this guilt my midnight wanderings and reveries beneath
the shade of that fatal elm were revived and reacted i heard the
discharge of the pistol i witnessed the alarm of inglefield i heard
his calls to his servants and saw them issue forth with lights and
hasten to the spot whence the sound had seemed to proceed i beheld my
friend stretched upon the earth ghastly with a mortal wound alone
with no traces of the slayer visible no tokens by which his place of
refuge might be sought the motives of his enmity or his instruments of
mischief might be detected

i hung over the dying youth whose insensibility forbade him to
recognise his friend or unfold the cause of his destruction i
accompanied his remains to the grave i tended the sacred spot where he
lay i once more exercised my penetration and my zeal in pursuit of his
assassin once more my meditations and exertions were doomed to be
disappointed

i need not remind thee of what is past time and reason seemed to have
dissolved the spell which made me deaf to the dictates of duty and
discretion remembrances had ceased to agonize to urge me to headlong
acts and foster sanguinary purposes the gloom was half dispersed and a
radiance had succeeded sweeter than my former joys

now by some unseen concurrence of reflections my thoughts reverted
into some degree of bitterness methought that to ascertain the hand who
killed my friend was not impossible and to punish the crime was just
that to forbear inquiry or withhold punishment was to violate my duty to
my god and to mankind the impulse was gradually awakened that bade me
once more to seek the elm once more to explore the ground to
scrutinize its trunk what could i expect to find had it not been a
hundred times examined had i not extended my search to the neighbouring
groves and precipices had i not pored upon the brooks and pried into
the pits and hollows that were adjacent to the scene of blood

lately i had viewed this conduct with shame and regret but in the
present state of my mind it assumed the appearance of conformity with
prudence and i felt myself irresistibly prompted to repeat my search
some time had elapsed since my departure from this district time
enough for momentous changes to occur expedients that formerly were
useless might now lead instantaneously to the end which i sought the
tree which had formerly been shunned by the criminal might in the
absence of the avenger of blood be incautiously approached thoughtless
or fearless of my return it was possible that he might at this moment
be detected hovering near the scene of his offences

nothing can be pleaded in extenuation of this relapse into folly my
return after an absence of some duration into the scene of these
transactions and sufferings the time of night the glimmering of the
stars the obscurity in which external objects were wrapped and which
consequently did not draw my attention from the images of fancy may in
some degree account for the revival of those sentiments and resolutions
which immediately succeeded the death of waldegrave and which during
my visit to you had been suspended

you know the situation of the elm in the midst of a private road on
the verge of norwalk near the habitation of inglefield but three miles
from my uncle's house it was now my intention to visit it the road in
which i was travelling led a different way it was requisite to leave
it therefore and make a circuit through meadows and over steeps my
journey would by these means be considerably prolonged but on that
head i was indifferent or rather considering how far the night had
already advanced it was desirable not to reach home till the dawn

i proceeded in this new direction with speed time however was allowed
for my impetuosities to subside and for sober thoughts to take place
still i persisted in this path to linger a few moments in this shade
to ponder on objects connected with events so momentous to my happiness
promised me a mournful satisfaction i was familiar with the way though
trackless and intricate and i climbed the steeps crept through the
brambles leaped the rivulets and fences with undeviating aim till at
length i reached the craggy and obscure path which led to inglefield's
house

in a short time i descried through the dusk the widespread branches of
the elm this tree however faintly seen cannot be mistaken for
another the remarkable bulk and shape of its trunk its position in the
midst of the way its branches spreading into an ample circumference
made it conspicuous from afar my pulse throbbed as i approached it

my eyes were eagerly bent to discover the trunk and the area beneath the
shade these as i approached gradually became visible the trunk was
not the only thing which appeared in view somewhat else which made
itself distinguishable by its motions was likewise noted i faltered
and stopped

to a casual observer this appearance would have been unnoticed to me
it could not but possess a powerful significance all my surmises and
suspicions instantly returned this apparition was human it was
connected with the fate of waldegrave it led to a disclosure of the
author of that fate what was i to do to approach unwarily would alarm
the person instant flight would set him beyond discovery and reach

i walked softly to the roadside the ground was covered with rocky
masses scattered among shrub-oaks and dwarf-cedars emblems of its
sterile and uncultivated state among these it was possible to elude
observation and yet approach near enough to gain an accurate view of
this being

at this time the atmosphere was somewhat illuminated by the moon
which though it had already set was yet so near the horizon as to
benefit me by its light the shape of a man tall and robust was now
distinguished repeated and closer scrutiny enabled me to perceive that
he was employed in digging the earth something like flannel was wrapped
round his waist and covered his lower limbs the rest of his frame was
naked i did not recognise in him any one whom i knew

a figure robust and strange and half naked to be thus employed at
this hour and place was calculated to rouse up my whole soul his
occupation was mysterious and obscure was it a grave that he was
digging was his purpose to explore or to hide was it proper to watch
him at a distance unobserved and in silence or to rush upon him and
extort from him by violence or menaces an explanation of the scene

before my resolution was formed he ceased to dig he cast aside his
spade and sat down in the pit that he had dug he seemed wrapped in
meditation but the pause was short and succeeded by sobs at first low
and at wide intervals but presently louder and more vehement sorely
charged was indeed that heart whence flowed these tokens of sorrow
never did i witness a scene of such mighty anguish such heart-bursting
grief

what should i think i was suspended in astonishment every sentiment
at length yielded to my sympathy every new accent of the mourner
struck upon my heart with additional force and tears found their way
spontaneously to my eyes i left the spot where i stood and advanced
within the verge of the shade my caution had forsaken me and instead
of one whom it was duty to persecute i beheld in this man nothing but
an object of compassion

my pace was checked by his suddenly ceasing to lament he snatched the
spade and rising on his feet began to cover up the pit with the
utmost diligence he seemed aware of my presence and desirous of hiding
something from my inspection i was prompted to advance nearer and hold
his hand but my uncertainty as to his character and views the
abruptness with which i had been ushered into this scene made me still
hesitate but though i hesitated to advance there was nothing to
hinder me from calling

what ho said i who is there what are you doing

he stopped the spade fell from his hand he looked up and bent forward
his face towards the spot where i stood an interview and explanation
were now methought unavoidable i mustered up my courage to confront
and interrogate this being

he continued for a minute in his gazing and listening attitude where i
stood i could not fail of being seen and yet he acted as if he saw
nothing again he betook himself to his spade and proceeded with new
diligence to fill up the pit this demeanour confounded and bewildered
me i had no power but to stand and silently gaze upon his motions

the pit being filled he once more sat upon the ground and resigned
himself to weeping and sighs with more vehemence than before in a short
time the fit seemed to have passed he rose seized the spade and
advanced to the spot where i stood

again i made preparation as for an interview which could not but take
place he passed me however without appearing to notice my existence
he came so near as almost to brush my arm yet turned not his head to
either side my nearer view of him made his brawny arms and lofty
stature more conspicuous but his imperfect dress the dimness of the
light and the confusion of my own thoughts hindered me from discerning
his features he proceeded with a few quick steps along the road but
presently darted to one side and disappeared among the rocks and bushes

my eye followed him as long as he was visible but my feet were rooted
to the spot my musing was rapid and incongruous it could not fail to
terminate in one conjecture that this person was asleep such
instances were not unknown to me through the medium of conversation and
books never indeed had it fallen under my own observation till now
and now it was conspicuous and environed with all that could give edge
to suspicion and vigour to inquiry to stand here was no longer of use
and i turned my steps towards my uncle's habitation




chapter ii


i had food enough for the longest contemplation my steps partook as
usual of the vehemence of my thoughts and i reached my uncle's gate
before i believed myself to have lost sight of the elm i looked up and
discovered the well-known habitation i could not endure that my
reflections should so speedily be interrupted i therefore passed the
gate and stopped not till i had reached a neighbouring summit crowned
with chestnut-oaks and poplars

here i more deliberately reviewed the incidents that had just occurred
the inference was just that the man half clothed and digging was a
sleeper but what was the cause of this morbid activity what was the
mournful vision that dissolved him in tears and extorted from him
tokens of inconsolable distress what did he seek or what endeavour to
conceal in this fatal spot the incapacity of sound sleep denotes a
mind sorely wounded it is thus that atrocious criminals denote the
possession of some dreadful secret the thoughts which considerations
of safety enable them to suppress or disguise during wakefulness
operate without impediment and exhibit their genuine effects when the
notices of sense are partly excluded and they are shut out from a
knowledge of their entire condition

this is the perpetrator of some nefarious deed what but the murder of
waldegrave could direct his steps hither his employment was part of
some fantastic drama in which his mind was busy to comprehend it
demands penetration into the recesses of his soul but one thing is
sure an incoherent conception of his concern in that transaction
bewitches him hither this it is that deluges his heart with bitterness
and supplies him with ever-flowing tears

but whence comes he he does not start from the bosom of the earth or
hide himself in airy distance he must have a name and a terrestrial
habitation it cannot be at an immeasurable distance from the haunted
elm inglefield's house is the nearest this may be one of its
inhabitants i did not recognise his features but this was owing to the
dusky atmosphere and to the singularity of his garb inglefield has two
servants one of whom was a native of this district simple guileless
and incapable of any act of violence he was moreover devoutly
attached to his sect he could not be the criminal

the other was a person of a very different cast he was an emigrant from
ireland and had been six months in the family of my friend he was a
pattern of sobriety and gentleness his mind was superior to his
situation his natural endowments were strong and had enjoyed all the
advantage of cultivation his demeanour was grave and thoughtful and
compassionate he appeared not untinctured with religion but his
devotion though unostentatious was of a melancholy tenor

there was nothing in the first view of his character calculated to
engender suspicion the neighbourhood was populous but as i conned
over the catalogue i perceived that the only foreigner among us was
clithero our scheme was for the most part a patriarchal one each
farmer was surrounded by his sons and kinsmen this was an exception to
the rule clithero was a stranger whose adventures and character
previously to his coming hither were unknown to us the elm was
surrounded by his master's domains an actor there must be and no one
was equally questionable

the more i revolved the pensive and reserved deportment of this man the
ignorance in which we were placed respecting his former situation his
possible motives for abandoning his country and choosing a station so
much below the standard of his intellectual attainments the stronger my
suspicions became formerly when occupied with conjectures relative to
the same topic the image of this man did not fail to occur but the
seeming harmlessness of his ordinary conduct had raised him to a level
with others and placed him equally beyond the reach of suspicion i did
not till now advert to the recentness of his appearance among us and
to the obscurity that hung over his origin and past life but now these
considerations appeared so highly momentous as almost to decide the
question of his guilt

but how were these doubts to be changed into absolute certainty
henceforth this man was to become the subject of my scrutiny i was to
gain all the knowledge respecting him which those with whom he lived
and were the perpetual witnesses of his actions could impart for this
end i was to make minute inquiries and to put seasonable
interrogatories from this conduct i promised myself an ultimate
solution of my doubts

i acquiesced in this view of things with considerable satisfaction it
seemed as if the maze was no longer inscrutable it would be quickly
discovered who were the agents and instigators of the murder of my
friend

but it suddenly occurred to me for what purpose shall i prosecute this
search what benefit am i to reap from this discovery how shall i
demean myself when the criminal is detected i was not insensible at
that moment of the impulses of vengeance but they were transient i
detested the sanguinary resolutions that i had once formed yet i was
fearful of the effects of my hasty rage and dreaded an encounter in
consequence of which i might rush into evils which no time could repair
nor penitence expiate

but why said i should it be impossible to arm myself with firmness
if forbearance be the dictate of wisdom cannot it be so deeply engraven
on my mind as to defy all temptation and be proof against the most
abrupt surprise my late experience has been of use to me it has shown
me my weakness and my strength having found my ancient fortifications
insufficient to withstand the enemy what should i learn from thence but
that it becomes me to strengthen and enlarge them

no caution indeed can hinder the experiment from being hazardous is
it wise to undertake experiments by which nothing can be gained and
much may be lost curiosity is vicious if undisciplined by reason and
inconducive to benefit

i was not however to be diverted from my purpose curiosity like
virtue is its own reward knowledge is of value for its own sake and
pleasure is annexed to the acquisition without regard to any thing
beyond it is precious even when disconnected with moral inducements and
heartfelt sympathies but the knowledge which i sought by its union with
these was calculated to excite the most complex and fiery sentiments in
my bosom

hours were employed in revolving these thoughts at length i began to be
sensible of fatigue and returning home explored the way to my chamber
without molesting the repose of the family you know that our doors are
always unfastened and are accessible at all hours of the night

my slumbers were imperfect and i rejoiced when the morning light
permitted me to resume my meditations the day glided away i scarcely
know how and as i had rejoiced at the return of morning i now hailed
with pleasure the approach of night

my uncle and sisters having retired i betook myself instead of
following their example to the chestnut-hill concealed among
its rocks or gazing at the prospect which stretched so far and so wide
around it my fancy has always been accustomed to derive its highest
enjoyment from this spot i found myself again at leisure to recall the
scene which i had witnessed during the last night to imagine its
connection with the fate of waldegrave and to plan the means of
discovering the secret that was hidden under these appearances

shortly i began to feel insupportable disquiet at the thoughts of
postponing this discovery wiles and stratagems were practicable but
they were tedious and of dubious success why should i proceed like a
plotter do i intend the injury of this person a generous purpose will
surely excuse me from descending to artifices there are two modes of
drawing forth the secrets of another by open and direct means and by
circuitous and indirect why scruple to adopt the former mode why not
demand a conference and state my doubts and demand a solution of them
in a manner worthy of a beneficent purpose why not hasten to the spot
he may be at this moment mysteriously occupied under this shade i may
note his behaviour i may ascertain his person if not by the features
that belong to him yet by tracing his footsteps when he departs and
pursuing him to his retreats

i embraced this scheme which was thus suggested with eagerness i
threw myself with headlong speed down the hill and pursued my way to the
elm as i approached the tree my palpitations increased though my pace
slackened i looked forward with an anxious glance the trunk of the
tree was hidden in the deepest shade i advanced close up to it no one
was visible but i was not discouraged the hour of his coming was
perhaps not arrived i took my station at a small distance beside a
fence on the right hand

an hour elapsed before my eyes lighted on the object of which they were
in search my previous observation had been roving from one quarter to
another at last it dwelt upon the tree the person whom i before
described was seated on the ground i had not perceived him before and
the means by which he placed himself in this situation had escaped my
notice he seemed like one whom an effort of will without the exercise
of locomotion had transported hither or made visible his state of
disarray and the darkness that shrouded him prevented me as before
from distinguishing any peculiarities in his figure or countenance

i continued watchful and mute the appearances already described took
place on this occasion except the circumstance of digging in the earth
he sat musing for a while then burst into sighs and lamentations

these being exhausted he rose to depart he stalked away with a solemn
and deliberate pace i resolved to tread as closely as possible in his
footsteps and not to lose sight of him till the termination of his
career

contrary to my expectation he went in a direction opposite to that
which led to inglefield's presently he stopped at bars which he
cautiously removed and when he had passed through them as
deliberately replaced he then proceeded along an obscure path which
led across stubble-fields to a wood the path continued through the
wood but he quickly struck out of it and made his way seemingly at
random through a most perplexing undergrowth of bushes and briers

i was at first fearful that the noise which i made behind him in
trampling down the thicket would alarm him but he regarded it not the
way that he had selected was always difficult sometimes considerable
force was requisite to beat down obstacles sometimes it led into a deep
glen the sides of which were so steep as scarcely to afford a footing
sometimes into fens from which some exertions were necessary to
extricate the feet and sometimes through rivulets of which the water
rose to the middle

for some time i felt no abatement of my speed or my resolution i
thought i might proceed without fear through brakes and dells which my
guide was able to penetrate he was perpetually changing his direction
i could form no just opinion as to my situation or distance from the
place at which we had set out

i began at length to be weary a suspicion likewise suggested itself
to my mind whether my guide did not perceive that he was followed and
thus prolonged his journey in order to fatigue or elude his pursuer i
was determined however to baffle his design though the air was
frosty my limbs were bedewed with sweat and my joints were relaxed with
toil but i was obstinately bent upon proceeding

at length a new idea occurred to me on finding me indefatigable in
pursuit this person might resort to more atrocious methods of
concealment but what had i to fear it was sufficient to be upon my
guard man to man i needed not to dread his encounter

we at last arrived at the verge of a considerable precipice he kept
along the edge from this height a dreary vale was discoverable
embarrassed with the leafless stocks of bushes and encumbered with
rugged and pointed rocks this scene reminded me of my situation the
desert tract called norwalk which i have often mentioned to you my
curiosity had formerly induced me to traverse in various directions it
was in the highest degree rugged picturesque and wild this vale
though i had never before viewed it by the glimpses of the moon
suggested the belief that i had visited it before such a one i knew
belonged to this uncultivated region if this opinion were true we were
at no inconsiderable distance from inglefield's habitation where
said i is this singular career to terminate

though occupied with these reflections i did not slacken my pursuit
the stranger kept along the verge of the cliff which gradually declined
till it terminated in the valley he then plunged into its deepest
thickets in a quarter of an hour he stopped under a projecture of the
rock which formed the opposite side of the vale he then proceeded to
remove the stalks which as i immediately perceived concealed the
mouth of a cavern he plunged into the darkness and in a few moments
his steps were heard no more

hitherto my courage had supported me but here it failed was this
person an assassin who was acquainted with the windings of the grotto
and who would take advantage of the dark to execute his vengeance upon
me who had dared to pursue him to these forlorn retreats or was he
maniac or walker in his sleep whichever supposition were true it
would be rash in me to follow him besides he could not long remain in
these darksome recesses unless some fatal accident should overtake him

i seated myself at the mouth of the cave determined patiently to wait
till he should think proper to emerge this opportunity of rest was
exceedingly acceptable after so toilsome a pilgrimage my pulse began to
beat more slowly and the moisture that incommoded me ceased to flow
the coolness which for a little time was delicious presently increased
to shivering and i found it necessary to change my posture in order to
preserve my blood from congealing

after i had formed a path before the cavern's mouth by the removal of
obstructions i employed myself in walking to and fro in this situation
i saw the moon gradually decline to the horizon and at length
disappear i marked the deepenings of the shade and the mutations which
every object successively underwent the vale was narrow and hemmed in
on all sides by lofty and precipitous cliffs the gloom deepened as the
moon declined and the faintness of starlight was all that preserved my
senses from being useless to my own guidance

i drew nearer the cleft at which this mysterious personage had entered
i stretched my hands before it determined that he should not emerge
from his den without my notice his steps would necessarily
communicate the tidings of his approach he could not move without a
noise which would be echoed to on all sides by the abruptness by which
this valley was surrounded here then i continued till the day began
to dawn in momentary expectation of the stranger's reappearance

my attention was at length excited by a sound that seemed to issue from
the cave i imagined that the sleeper was returning and prepared
therefore to seize him i blamed myself for neglecting the opportunities
that had already been afforded and was determined that another should
not escape my eyes were fixed upon the entrance the rustling
increased and presently an animal leaped forth of what kind i was
unable to discover heart-struck by this disappointment but not
discouraged i continued to watch but in vain the day was advancing
apace at length the sun arose and its beams glistened on the edges of
the cliffs above whose sapless stalks and rugged masses were covered
with hoarfrost i began to despair of success but was unwilling to
depart until it was no longer possible to hope for the return of this
extraordinary personage whether he had been swallowed up by some of the
abysses of this grotto or lurked near the entrance waiting my
departure or had made his exit at another and distant aperture was
unknown to me

exhausted and discouraged i prepared at length to return it was easy
to find my way out of this wilderness by going forward in one direction
regardless of impediments and cross-paths my absence i believed to have
occasioned no alarm to my family since they knew not of my intention to
spend the night abroad thus unsatisfactorily terminated this night's
adventures




chapter iii


the ensuing day was spent partly in sleep and partly in languor and
disquietude i incessantly ruminated on the incidents of the last night
the scheme that i had formed was defeated was it likely that this
unknown person would repeat his midnight visits to the elm if he did
and could again be discovered should i resolve to undertake a new
pursuit which might terminate abortively or in some signal disaster
but what proof had i that the same route would be taken and that he
would again inter himself alive in the same spot or if he did since
his reappearance would sufficiently prove that the cavern was not
dangerous and that he who should adventure in might hope to come out
again in safety why not enter it after him what could be the
inducements of this person to betake himself to subterranean retreats
the basis of all this region is limestone a substance that
eminently abounds in rifts and cavities these by the gradual decay of
their cementing parts frequently make their appearance in spots where
they might have been least expected my attention has often been excited
by the hollow sound which was produced by my casual footsteps and which
showed me that i trod upon the roof of caverns a mountain-cave and the
rumbling of an unseen torrent are appendages of this scene dear to my
youthful imagination many of romantic structure were found within the
precincts of norwalk

these i had industriously sought out but this had hitherto escaped my
observation and i formed the resolution of some time exploring it at
present i determined to revisit the elm and dig in the spot where this
person had been employed in a similar way it might be that something
was here deposited which might exhibit this transaction in a new light
at the suitable hour on the ensuing night i took my former stand the
person again appeared my intention to dig was to be carried into effect
on condition of his absence and was consequently frustrated

instead of rushing on him and breaking at once the spell by which his
senses were bound i concluded contrary to my first design to wait his
departure and allow myself to be conducted whithersoever he pleased
the track into which he now led me was different from the former one it
was a maze oblique circuitous upward and downward in a degree which
only could take place in a region so remarkably irregular in surface so
abounding with hillocks and steeps and pits and brooks as
solesbury it seemed to be the sole end of his labours to
bewilder or fatigue his pursuer to pierce into the deepest thickets to
plunge into the darkest cavities to ascend the most difficult heights
and approach the slippery and tremulous verge of the dizziest
precipices

i disdained to be outstripped in this career all dangers were
overlooked and all difficulties defied i plunged into obscurities and
clambered over obstacles from which in a different state of mind and
with a different object of pursuit i should have recoiled with
invincible timidity when the scene had passed i could not review the
perils i had undergone without shuddering

at length my conductor struck into a path which compared with the
ruggedness of that which we had lately trodden was easy and smooth
this track led us to the skirt of the wilderness and at no long time we
reached an open field when a dwelling appeared at a small distance
which i speedily recognised to be that belonging to inglefield i now
anticipated the fulfilment of my predictions my conductor directed his
steps towards the barn into which he entered by a small door

how were my doubts removed this was no other than clithero edny there
was nothing in his appearance incompatible with this conclusion he and
his fellow-servant occupied an apartment in the barn as a lodging-room
this arduous purpose was accomplished and i retired to the shelter of a
neighbouring shed not so much to repose myself after the fatigues of my
extraordinary journey as to devise further expedients

nothing now remained but to take clithero to task to repeat to him the
observations of the two last nights to unfold to him my conjectures and
suspicions to convince him of the rectitude of my intentions and to
extort from him a disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the
death of waldegrave which it was in his power to communicate

in order to obtain a conference i resolved to invite him to my uncle's
to perform a certain piece of work for me under my own eyes he would
of course spend the night with us and in the evening i would take an
opportunity of entering into conversation with him

a period of the deepest deliberation was necessary to qualify myself for
performing suitably my part in this projected interview i attended to
the feelings that were suggested in this new state of my knowledge i
found reason to confide in my newly-acquired equanimity remorse said
i is an ample and proper expiation for all offences what does
vengeance desire but to inflict misery if misery come its desires are
accomplished it is only the obdurate and exulting criminal that is
worthy of our indignation it is common for pity to succeed the
bitterest suggestions of resentment if the vengeful mind be delighted
with the spectacle of woes of its own contriving at least its canine
hunger is appeased and thenceforth its hands are inactive

on the evening of the next day i paid a visit to inglefield i wished
to impart to him the discoveries that i had made and to listen to his
reflections on the subject i likewise desired to obtain all possible
information from the family respecting the conduct of clithero

my friend received me with his usual kindness thou art no stranger to
his character thou knowest with what paternal affection i have ever
been regarded by this old man with what solicitude the wanderings of my
reason and my freaks of passion have been noted and corrected by him
thou knowest his activity to save the life of thy brother and the hours
that have been spent by him in aiding my conjectures as to the cause of
his death and inculcating the lessons of penitence and duty

the topics which could not but occur at such a meeting were quickly
discussed and i hastily proceeded to that subject which was nearest my
heart i related the adventures of the two preceding nights and
mentioned the inference to which they irresistibly led

he said that this inference coincided with suspicions he had formed
since our last interview in consequence of certain communications from
his housekeeper it seems the character of clithero had from the first
exercised the inquisitiveness of this old lady she had carefully marked
his musing and melancholy deportment she had tried innumerable
expedients for obtaining a knowledge of his past life and particularly
of his motives for coming to america these expedients however profound
and addressful had failed he took no pains to elude them he contented
himself with turning a deaf ear to all indirect allusions and hints
and when more explicitly questioned with simply declaring that he had
nothing to communicate worthy of her notice

during the day he was a sober and diligent workman his evenings he
spent in incommunicative silence on sundays he always rambled away no
one knew whither and without a companion i have already observed that
he and his fellow-servant occupied the same apartment in the barn this
circumstance was not unattended to by miss inglefield the name of
clithero's companion was ambrose this man was copiously interrogated by
his mistress and she found him by no means so refractory as the other

ambrose in his tedious and confused way related that soon after
clithero and he had become bedfellows the former was considerably
disturbed by restlessness and talking in his sleep his discourse was
incoherent it was generally in the tone of expostulation and appeared
to be entreating to be saved from some great injury such phrases as
these have pity have mercy were frequently intermingled with
groans and accompanied with weeping sometimes he seemed to be holding
conferences with some one who was making him considerable offers on
condition of his performing some dangerous service what he said in his
own person and in answer to his imaginary tempter testified the utmost
reluctance

ambrose had no curiosity on the subject as this interruption prevented
him at first from sleeping it was his custom to put an end to the
dialogue by awakening his companion who betrayed tokens of great alarm
and dejection on discovering how he had been employed he would
solicitously inquire what were the words that he had uttered but
ambrose's report was seldom satisfactory because he had attended to
them but little and because he grudged every moment in which he was
deprived of his accustomed repose

whether clithero had ceased from this practice or habit had reconciled
his companion to the sounds they no longer occasioned any interruption
to his slumber

no one appeared more shocked than he at the death of waldegrave after
this event his dejection suddenly increased this symptom was observed
by the family but none but the housekeeper took the trouble to notice
it to him or build conjectures on the incident during nights however
ambrose experienced a renewal of his ancient disturbances he remarked
that clithero one night had disappeared from his side ambrose's range
of reflection was extremely narrow quickly falling asleep and finding
his companion beside him when he awoke he dismissed it from his mind

on several ensuing nights he awakened in like manner and always found
his companion's place empty the repetition of so strange an incident at
length incited him to mention it to clithero the latter was confounded
at this intelligence he questioned ambrose with great anxiety as to the
particulars of this event but he could gain no satisfaction from the
stupid inattention of the other from this time there was a visible
augmentation of his sadness his fits of taciturnity became more
obstinate and a deeper gloom sat upon his brow

there was one other circumstance of particular importance mentioned by
the housekeeper one evening some one on horseback stopped at this gate
he rattled at the gate with an air of authority in token of his desire
that some one would come from the house miss inglefield was employed in
the kitchen from a window of which she perceived who it was that made
the signal clithero happened at the same moment to be employed near
her she therefore desired him to go and see whom the stranger wanted
he laid aside his work and went the conference lasted above five
minutes the length of it excited in her a faint degree of surprise
inducing her to leave her employment and pay an unintermitted attention
to the scene there was nothing however but its duration that rendered
it remarkable

clithero at length entered and the traveller proceeded the countenance
of the former betrayed a degree of perturbation which she had never
witnessed before the muscles of his face were distorted and tremulous
he immediately sat down to his work but he seemed for some time to
have lost all power over his limbs he struggled to avoid the sight of
the lady and his gestures irresolute or misdirected betokened the
deepest dismay after some time he recovered in some degree his
self-possession but while the object was viewed through a new medium
and the change existed only in the imagination of the observer a change
was certainly discovered

these circumstances were related to me by inglefield and corroborated by
his housekeeper one consequence inevitably flowed from them the
sleep-walker he who had led me through so devious a tract was no other
than clithero there was likewise a strong relation between this person
and him who stopped at the gate what was the subject of discourse between
them in answer to miss inglefield's interrogatories he merely said
that the traveller inquired whither the road led which at a small
distance forward struck out of the principal one considering the
length of the interview it was not likely that this was the only topic

my determination to confer with him in private acquired new force from
these reflections inglefield assented to my proposal his own affairs
would permit the absence of his servant for one day i saw no necessity
for delay and immediately made my request to clithero i was fashioning
an implement i told him with respect to which i could not wholly
depend upon my own skill i was acquainted with the dexterity of his
contrivances and the neatness of his workmanship he readily consented
to assist me on this occasion next day he came contrary to my
expectation he prepared to return home in the evening i urged him to
spend the night with us but no it was equally convenient and more
agreeable to him to return

i was not aware of this resolution i might indeed have foreseen that
being conscious of his infirmity he would desire to avoid the scrutiny
of strangers i was painfully disconcerted but it occurred to me that
the best that could be done was to bear him company and seize some
opportunity during this interval of effecting my purpose i told him
that since he would not remain i cared not if for the sake of
recreation and of a much more momentous purpose i went along with him
he tacitly and without apparent reluctance consented to my scheme
and accordingly we set off together this was an awful crisis the
time had now come that was to dissipate my uncertainty by what means
should i introduce a topic so momentous and singular i had been
qualified by no experience for rightly conducting myself on so critical
an emergency my companion preserved a mournful and inviolable silence
he afforded me no opening by which i might reach the point in view his
demeanour was sedate while i was almost disabled by the confusion of
my thoughts to utter a word

it was a dreadful charge that i was about to insinuate i was to accuse
my companion of nothing less than murder i was to call upon him for an
avowal of his guilt i was to state the ground of my suspicions and
desire him to confute or confirm them in doing this i was principally
stimulated by an ungovernable curiosity yet if i intended not the
conferring of a benefit i did not at least purpose the infliction of
evil i persuaded myself that i was able to exclude from my bosom all
sanguinary or vengeful impulses and that whatever should be the issue
of this conversation my equanimity would be unsubdued

i revolved various modes of introducing the topic by which my mind was
engaged i passed rapidly from one to another none of them were
sufficiently free from objection to allow me to adopt it my perplexity
became every moment more painful and my ability to extricate myself
less

in this state of uncertainty so much time elapsed that the elm at
length appeared in sight this object had somewhat of a mechanical
influence upon me i stopped short and seized the arm of my companion
till this moment he appeared to have been engrossed by his own
reflections and not to have heeded those emotions which must have been
sufficiently conspicuous in my looks

this action recalled him from his reverie the first idea that occurred
to him when he had noticed my behaviour was that i was assailed by
some sudden indisposition

what is the matter said he in a tone of anxiety are you not well

yes replied i perfectly well but stop a moment i have something
to say to you

to me answered he with surprise

yes said i let us turn down this path pointing at the same
time to that along which i had followed him the preceding night

he now partook in some degree of my embarrassment

is there any thing particular said he in a doubting accent there he
stopped

something i answered of the highest moment go with me down this
path we shall be in less danger of interruption

he was irresolute and silent but seeing me remove the bars and pass
through them he followed me nothing more was said till we entered the
wood i trusted to the suggestions of the moment i had now gone too far
to recede and the necessity that pressed upon me supplied me with
words i continued 

this is a remarkable spot you may wonder why i have led you to it i
ought not to keep you in suspense there is a tale connected with it
which i am desirous of telling you for this purpose i have brought you
hither listen to me

i then recapitulated the adventures of the two preceding nights i added
nothing nor retrenched any thing he listened in the deepest silence
from every incident he gathered new cause of alarm repeatedly he wiped
his face with his handkerchief and sighed deeply i took no verbal
notice of these symptoms i deemed it incumbent on me to repress
nothing when i came to the concluding circumstance by which his person
was identified he heard me without any new surprise to this narrative
i subjoined the inquiries that i had made at inglefield's and the
result of those inquiries i then continued in these words 

you may ask why i subjected myself to all this trouble the
mysteriousness of these transactions would have naturally suggested
curiosity in any one a transient passenger would probably have acted as
i have done but i had motives peculiar to myself need i remind you of
a late disaster that it happened beneath the shade of this tree am i
not justified in drawing certain inferences from your behaviour what
they are i leave you to judge be it your task to confute or confirm
them for this end i have conducted you hither

my suspicions are vehement how can they be otherwise i call upon you
to say whether they be just

the spot where we stood was illuminated by the moon that had now risen
though all around was dark hence his features and person were easily
distinguished his hands hung at his side his eyes were downcast and
he was motionless as a statue my last words seemed scarcely to have
made any impression on his sense i had no need to provide against the
possible suggestions of revenge i felt nothing but the tenderness of
compassion i continued for some time to observe him in silence and
could discover no tokens of a change of mood i could not forbear at
last to express my uneasiness at the fixedness of his features and
attitude

recollect yourself i mean not to urge you too closely this topic is
solemn but it need not divest you of the fortitude becoming a man

the sound of my voice startled him he broke from me looked up and
fixed his eyes upon me with an expression of affright he shuddered and
recoiled as from a spectre i began to repent of my experiment i could
say nothing suitable to this occasion i was obliged to stand a silent
and powerless spectator and to suffer this paroxysm to subside of
itself when its violence appeared to be somewhat abated i resumed 

i can feel for you i act not thus in compliance with a temper that
delights in the misery of others the explanation that i have solicited
is no less necessary for your sake than for mine you are no stranger to
the light in which i viewed this man you have witnessed the grief which
his fate occasioned and the efforts that i made to discover and drag to
punishment his murderer you heard the execrations that i heaped upon
him and my vows of eternal revenge you expect that having detected
the offender i will hunt him to infamy and death you are mistaken i
consider the deed as sufficiently expiated

i am no stranger to your gnawing cares to the deep and incurable
despair that haunts you to which your waking thoughts are a prey and
from which sleep cannot secure you i know the enormity of your crime
but i know not your inducements whatever they were i see the
consequences with regard to yourself i see proofs of that remorse which
must ever be attendant on guilt

this is enough why should the effects of our misdeeds be
inexhaustible why should we be debarred from a comforter an
opportunity of repairing our errors may at least be demanded from the
rulers of our destiny

i once imagined that he who killed waldegrave inflicted the greatest
possible injury on me that was an error which reflection has cured
were futurity laid open to my view and events with their consequences
unfolded i might see reason to embrace the assassin as my best friend
be comforted

he was still incapable of speaking but tears came to his relief
without attending to my remonstrances he betrayed a disposition to
return i had hitherto hoped for some disclosure but now feared that
it was designed to be withheld he stopped not till we reached
inglefield's piazza he then spoke for the first time but in a hollow
and tremulous voice 

you demand of me a confession of crimes you shall have it some time
you shall have it when it will be i cannot tell something must be
done and shortly

he hurried from me into the house and after a pause i turned my
steps home wards my reflections as i proceeded perpetually revolved
round a single point these were scarcely more than a repetition with
slight variations of a single idea

when i awoke in the morning i hied in fancy to the wilderness i saw
nothing but the figure of the wanderer before me i traced his footsteps
anew retold my narrative and pondered on his gestures and words my
condition was not destitute of enjoyment my stormy passions had
subsided into a calm portentous and awful my soul was big with
expectation i seemed as if i were on the eve of being ushered into a
world whose scenes were tremendous but sublime the suggestions of
sorrow and malice had for a time taken their flight and yielded place
to a generous sympathy which filled my eyes with tears but had more in
it of pleasure than of pain that clithero was instrumental to the death
of waldegrave that he could furnish the clue explanatory of every
bloody and mysterious event that had hitherto occurred there was no
longer the possibility of doubting he indeed said i is the
murderer of excellence and yet it shall be my province to emulate a
father's clemency and restore this unhappy man to purity and to peace

day after day passed without hearing any thing of clithero i began to
grow uneasy and impatient i had gained so much and by means so
unexpected that i could more easily endure uncertainty with respect to
what remained to be known but my patience had its limits i should
doubtless have made use of new means to accelerate this discovery had
not his timely appearance made them superfluous

sunday being at length arrived i resolved to go to inglefield's seek
an interview with his servant and urge him by new importunities to
confide to me the secret on my way thither clithero appeared in sight
his visage was pale and wan and his form emaciated and shrunk i was
astonished at the alteration which the lapse of a week had made in his
appearance at a small distance i mistook him for a stranger as soon as
i perceived who it was i greeted him with the utmost friendliness my
civilities made little impression on him and he hastened to inform me
that he was coming to my uncle's for the purpose of meeting and talking
with me if i thought proper we would go into the wood together and
find some spot where we might discourse at our leisure and be exempt
from interruption

you will easily conceive with what alacrity i accepted his invitation
we returned from the road into the first path and proceeded in silence
till the wildness of the surrounding scenery informed us that we were in
the heart of norwalk we lighted on a recess to which my companion
appeared to be familiar and which had all the advantages of solitude
and was suitable to rest here we stopped hitherto my companion had
displayed a certain degree of composure now his countenance betokened a
violent internal struggle it was a considerable time before he could
command his speech when he had so far effected the conquest of his
feelings he began




chapter iv


you call upon me for a confession of my offences what a strange fortune
is mine that a human being in the present circumstances should make
this demand and that i should be driven by an irresistible necessity
to comply with it that here should terminate my calamitous series that
my destiny should call upon me to lie down and die in a region so
remote from the scene of my crime at a distance so great from all that
witnessed and endured their consequences

you believe me to be an assassin you require me to explain the motives
that induced me to murder the innocent while this is your belief and
this the scope of your expectations you may be sure of my compliance i
could resist every demand but this

for what purpose have i come hither is it to relate my story shall i
calmly sit here and rehearse the incidents of my life will my strength
be adequate to this rehearsal let me recollect the motives that
governed me when i formed this design perhaps a strenuousness may be
imparted by them which otherwise i cannot hope to obtain for the sake
of those i consent to conjure up the ghost of the past and to begin a
tale that with a fortitude like mine i am not sure that i shall live
to finish

you are unacquainted with the man before you the inferences which you
have drawn with regard to my designs and my conduct are a tissue of
destructive errors you like others are blind to the most momentous
consequences of your own actions you talk of imparting consolation you
boast the beneficence of your intentions you set yourself to do me a
benefit what are the effects of your misguided zeal and random efforts
they have brought my life to a miserable close they have shrouded the
last scene of it in blood they have put the seal to my perdition

my misery has been greater than has fallen to the lot of mortals yet it
is but beginning my present path full as it is of asperities is
better than that into which i must enter when this is abandoned
perhaps if my pilgrimage had been longer i might at some future day
have lighted upon hope in consequence of your interference i am
forever debarred from it my existence is henceforward to be invariable
the woes that are reserved for me are incapable alike of alleviation or
intermission

but i came not hither to recriminate i came not hither to accuse
others but myself i know the retribution that is appointed for guilt
like mine it is just i may shudder at the foresight of my punishment
and shrink in the endurance of it but i shall be indebted for part of
my torment to the vigour of my understanding which teaches me that my
punishment is just why should i procrastinate my doom and strive to
render my burden more light it is but just that it should crush me its
procrastination is impossible the stroke is already felt even now i
drink of the cup of retribution a change of being cannot aggravate my
woe till consciousness itself be extinct the worm that gnaws me will
never perish

fain would i be relieved from this task gladly would i bury in oblivion
the transactions of my life but no my fate is uniform the demon that
controlled me at first is still in the fruition of power i am entangled
in his fold and every effort that i make to escape only involves me in
deeper ruin i need not conceal for all the consequences of disclosure
are already experienced i cannot endure a groundless imputation though
to free me from it i must create and justify imputations still more
atrocious my story may at least be brief if the agonies of remembrance
must be awakened afresh let me do all that in me lies to shorten them

i was born in the county of armagh my parents were of the better sort
of peasants and were able to provide me with the rudiments of
knowledge i should doubtless have trodden in their footsteps and have
spent my life in the cultivation of their scanty fields if an event had
not happened which for a long time i regarded as the most fortunate
of my life but which i now regard as the scheme of some infernal agent
and as the primary source of all my calamities

my father's farm was a portion of the demesne of one who resided wholly
in the metropolis and consigned the management of his estates to his
stewards and retainers this person married a lady who brought him great
accession of fortune her wealth was her only recommendation in the eyes
of her husband whose understanding was depraved by the prejudices of
luxury and rank but was the least of her attractions in the estimate
of reasonable beings

they passed some years together if their union were not a source of
misery to the lady she was indebted for her tranquillity to the force
of her mind she was indeed governed in every action of her life by
the precepts of duty while her husband listened to no calls but those
of pernicious dissipation he was immersed in all the vices that grow
out of opulence and a mistaken education

happily for his wife his career was short he was enraged at the
infidelity of his mistress to purchase whose attachment he had lavished
two-thirds of his fortune he called the paramour by whom he had been
supplanted to the field the contest was obstinate and terminated in
the death of the challenger

this event freed the lady from many distressful and humiliating
obligations she determined to profit by her newly-acquired
independence to live thenceforward conformably to her notions of right
to preserve and improve by schemes of economy the remains of her
fortune and to employ it in the diffusion of good her plans made it
necessary to visit her estates in the distant provinces

during her abode in the manor of which my father was a vassal she
visited his cottage i was at that time a child she was pleased with my
vivacity and promptitude and determined to take me under her own
protection my parents joyfully acceded to her proposal and i returned
with her to the capital

she had an only son of my own age her design in relation to me was
that i should be educated with her child and that an affection in this
way might be excited in me towards my young master which might render
me when we should attain to manhood one of his most faithful and
intelligent dependants i enjoyed equally with him all the essential
benefits of education there were certain accomplishments from which i
was excluded from the belief that they were unsuitable to my rank and
station i was permitted to acquire others which had she been actuated
by true discernment she would perhaps have discovered to be far more
incompatible with a servile station in proportion as my views were
refined and enlarged by history and science i was likely to contract a
thirst of independence and an impatience of subjection and poverty

when the period of childhood and youth was past it was thought proper
to send her son to improve his knowledge and manners by a residence on
the continent this young man was endowed with splendid abilities his
errors were the growth of his condition all the expedients that
maternal solicitude and wisdom could suggest were employed to render him
a useful citizen perhaps this wisdom was attested by the large share of
excellence which he really possessed and that his character was not
unblemished proved only that no exertions could preserve him from the
vices that are inherent in wealth and rank and which flow from the
spectacle of universal depravity

as to me it would be folly to deny that i had benefited by my
opportunities of improvement i fulfilled the expectation of my
mistress in one respect i was deeply imbued with affection for her
son and reverence for herself perhaps the force of education was
evinced in those particulars without reflecting any credit on the
directors of it those might merit the name of defects which were
regarded by them as accomplishments my unfavourable qualities like
those of my master were imputed to my condition though perhaps the
difference was advantageous to me since the vices of servitude are less
hateful than those of tyranny

it was resolved that i should accompany my master in his travels in
quality of favourite domestic my principles whatever might be their
rectitude were harmonious and flexible i had devoted my life to the
service of my patron i had formed conceptions of what was really
conducive to his interest and was not to be misled by specious
appearances if my affection had not stimulated my diligence i should
have found sufficient motives in the behaviour of his mother she
condescended to express her reliance on my integrity and judgment she
was not ashamed to manifest at parting the tenderness of a mother and
to acknowledge that all her tears were not shed on her son's account i
had my part in the regrets that called them forth

during our absence i was my master's constant attendant i corresponded
with his mother and made the conduct of her son the principal theme of
my letters i deemed it my privilege as well as duty to sit in
judgment on his actions to form my opinions without regard to selfish
considerations and to avow them whenever the avowal tended to benefit
every letter which i wrote particularly those in which his behaviour
was freely criticized i allowed him to peruse i would on no account
connive at or participate in the slightest irregularity i knew the duty
of my station and assumed no other control than that which resulted
from the avoiding of deceit and the open expression of my sentiments
the youth was of a noble spirit but his firmness was wavering he
yielded to temptations which a censor less rigorous than i would have
regarded as venial or perhaps laudable my duty required me to set
before him the consequences of his actions and to give impartial and
timely information to his mother

he could not brook a monitor the more he needed reproof the less
supportable it became my company became every day less agreeable till
at length there appeared a necessity of parting a separation took
place but not as enemies i never lost his respect in his
representations to his mother he was just to my character and services
my dismission was not allowed to injure my fortune and his mother
considered this event merely as a new proof of the inflexible
consistency of my principles

on this change in my situation she proposed to me to become a member of
her own family no proposal could be more acceptable i was fully
acquainted with the character of this lady and had nothing to fear from
injustice and caprice i did not regard her with filial familiarity but
my attachment and reverence would have done honour to that relation i
performed for her the functions of a steward her estates in the city
were put under my direction she placed boundless confidence in my
discretion and integrity and consigned to me the payment and in some
degree the selection and government of her servants my station was a
servile one yet most of the evils of servitude were unknown to me my
personal ease and independence were less infringed than that of those
who are accounted the freest members of society i derived a sort of
authority and dignity from the receipt and disbursement of money the
tenants and debtors of the lady were in some respects mine it was
for the most part on my justice and lenity that they depended for their
treatment my lady's household-establishment was large and opulent her
servants were my inferiors and menials my leisure was considerable and
my emoluments large enough to supply me with every valuable instrument
of improvement or pleasure

these were reasons why i should be contented with my lot these
circumstances alone would have rendered it more eligible than any other
but it had additional and far more powerful recommendations arising
from the character of mrs lorimer and from the relation in which she
allowed me to stand to her

how shall i enter upon this theme how shall i expatiate upon
excellencies which it was my fate to view in their genuine colours to
adore with an immeasurable and inextinguishable ardour and which
nevertheless it was my hateful task to blast and destroy yet i will
not be spared i shall find in the rehearsal new incitements to
sorrow i deserve to be supreme in misery and will not be denied the
full measure of a bitter retribution

no one was better qualified to judge of her excellencies a casual
spectator might admire her beauty and the dignity of her demeanour
from the contemplation of those he might gather motives for loving or
revering her age was far from having withered her complexion or
destroyed the evenness of her skin but no time could rob her of the
sweetness and intelligence which animated her features her habitual
beneficence was bespoken in every look always in search of occasions
for doing good always meditating scenes of happiness of which she was
the author or of distress for which she was preparing relief the most
torpid insensibility was for a time subdued and the most depraved
smitten by charms of which in another person they would not perhaps
have been sensible

a casual visitant might enjoy her conversation might applaud the
rectitude of her sentiments the richness of her elocution and her
skill in all the offices of politeness but it was only for him who
dwelt constantly under the same roof to mark the inviolable consistency
of her actions and opinions the ceaseless flow of her candour her
cheerfulness and her benevolence it was only for one who witnessed her
behaviour at all hours in sickness and in health her management of
that great instrument of evil and good money her treatment of her son
her menials and her kindred rightly to estimate her merits

the intercourse between us was frequent but of a peculiar kind my
office in her family required me often to see her to submit schemes to
her consideration and receive her directions at these times she
treated me in a manner in some degree adapted to the difference of rank
and the inferiority of my station and yet widely dissimilar from that
which a different person would have adopted in the same circumstances
the treatment was not that of an equal and a friend but still more
remote was it from that of a mistress it was merely characterized by
affability and condescension but as such it had no limits

she made no scruple to ask my counsel in every pecuniary affair to
listen to my arguments and decide conformably to what after sufficient
canvassings and discussions should appear to be right when the direct
occasions of our interview were dismissed i did not of course withdraw
to detain or dismiss me was indeed at her option but if no engagement
interfered she would enter into general conversation there was none
who could with more safety to herself have made the world her confessor
but the state of society in which she lived imposed certain limitations
on her candour in her intercourse with me there were fewer restraints
than on any other occasion my situation had made me more intimately
acquainted with domestic transactions with her views respecting her
son and with the terms on which she thought proper to stand with those
whom old acquaintance or kindred gave some title to her good offices in
addition to all those motives to a candid treatment of me there were
others which owed their efficacy to her maternal regard for me and to
the artless and unsuspecting generosity of her character

her hours were distributed with the utmost regularity and appropriated
to the best purposes she selected her society without regard to any
qualities but probity and talents her associates were numerous and her
evening conversations embellished with all that could charm the senses
or instruct the understanding this was a chosen field for the display
of her magnificence but her grandeur was unostentatious and her
gravity unmingled with haughtiness from these my station excluded me
but i was compensated by the freedom of her communications in the
intervals she found pleasure in detailing to me the incidents that
passed on those occasions in rehearsing conversations and depicting
characters there was an uncommon portion of dramatic merit in her
recitals besides valuable and curious information one uniform effect
was produced in me by this behaviour each day i thought it impossible
for my attachment to receive any new accessions yet the morrow was sure
to produce some new emotion of respect or of gratitude and to set the
unrivalled accomplishments of this lady in a new and more favourable
point of view i contemplated no change in my condition the necessity
of change whatever were the alternative would have been a subject of
piercing regret i deemed my life a cheap sacrifice in her cause no
time would suffice to discharge the debt of gratitude that was due to
her yet it was continually accumulating if an anxious thought ever
invaded my bosom it arose from this source

it was no difficult task faithfully to execute the functions assigned to
me no merit could accrue to me from this source i was exposed to no
temptation i had passed the feverish period of youth no contagious
example had contaminated my principles i had resisted the allurements
of sensuality and dissipation incident to my age my dwelling was in
pomp and splendour i had amassed sufficient to secure me in case of
unforeseen accidents in the enjoyment of competence my mental
resources were not despicable and the external means of intellectual
gratification were boundless i enjoyed an unsullied reputation my
character was well known in that sphere which my lady occupied not only
by means of her favourable report but in numberless ways in which it
was my fortune to perform personal services to others




chapter v


mrs lorimer had a twin-brother nature had impressed the same image
upon them and had modelled them after the same pattern the resemblance
between them was exact to a degree almost incredible in infancy and
childhood they were perpetually liable to be mistaken for each other as
they grew up nothing to a superficial examination appeared to
distinguish them but the sexual characteristics a sagacious observer
would doubtless have noted the most essential differences in all
those modifications of the features which are produced by habits and
sentiments no two persons were less alike nature seemed to have
intended them as examples of the futility of those theories which
ascribe every thing to conformation and instinct and nothing to external
circumstances in what different modes the same materials may be
fashioned and to what different purposes the same materials may be
applied perhaps the rudiments of their intellectual character as well
as of their form were the same but the powers that in one case were
exerted in the cause of virtue were in the other misapplied to sordid
and flagitious purposes

arthur wiatte that was his name had ever been the object of his
sister's affection as long as he existed she never ceased to labour in
the promotion of his happiness all her kindness was repaid by a stern
and inexorable hatred this man was an exception to all the rules which
govern us in our judgments of human nature he exceeded in depravity all
that has been imputed to the arch-foe of mankind his wickedness was
without any of those remorseful intermissions from which it has been
supposed that the deepest guilt is not entirely exempt he seemed to
relish no food but pure unadulterated evil he rejoiced in proportion to
the depth of that distress of which he was the author

his sister by being placed most within the reach of his enmity
experienced its worst effects she was the subject on which by being
acquainted with the means of influencing her happiness he could try his
malignant experiments with most hope of success her parents being high
in rank and wealth the marriage of their daughter was of course an
object of anxious attention there is no event on which our felicity and
usefulness more materially depends and with regard to which therefore
the freedom of choice and the exercise of our own understanding ought to
be less infringed but this maxim is commonly disregarded in proportion
to the elevation of our rank and extent of our property

the lady made her own election but she wras one of those who acted on a
comprehensive plan and would not admit her private inclination to
dictate her decision the happiness of others though founded on
mistaken views she did not consider as unworthy of her regard the
choice was such as was not likely to obtain the parental sanction to
whom the moral qualities of their son-in-law though not absolutely
weightless in the balance were greatly inferior to the considerations
of wealth and dignity

the brother set no value on any thing but the means of luxury and power
he was astonished at that perverseness which entertained a different
conception of happiness from himself love and friendship he considered
as groundless and chimerical and believed that those delusions would
in people of sense be rectified by experience but he knew the
obstinacy of his sister's attachment to these phantoms and that to
bereave her of the good they promised was the most effectual means of
rendering her miserable for this end he set himself to thwart her
wishes in the imbecility and false indulgence of his parents he found
the most powerful auxiliaries he prevailed upon them to forbid that
union which wanted nothing but their concurrence and their consent to
endow her with a small portion of their patrimony to render completely
eligible the cause was that of her happiness and the happiness of him
on whom she had bestowed her heart it behooved her therefore to call
forth all her energies in defence of it to weaken her brother's
influence on the minds of her parents or to win him to be her advocate
when i reflect upon her mental powers and the advantages which should
seem to flow from the circumstance of pleading in the character of
daughter arid sister i can scarcely believe that her attempts
miscarried i should have imagined that all obstacles would yield before
her and particularly in a case like this in which she must have
summoned all her forces and never have believed that she had struggled
sufficiently

certain it is that her lot was fixed she was not only denied the
husband of her choice but another was imposed upon her whose
recommendations were irresistible in every one's apprehension but her
own the discarded lover was treated with every sort of contumely
deceit and violence were employed by her brother to bring his honour
his liberty and even his life into hazard all these iniquities
produced no inconsiderable effect on the mind of the lady the
machinations to which her love was exposed would have exasperated him
into madness had not her most strenuous exertions been directed to
appease him

she prevailed on him at length to abandon his country though she
thereby merely turned her brother's depravity into a new channel her
parents died without consciousness of the evils they inflicted but they
experienced a bitter retribution in the conduct of their son he was the
darling and stay of an ancient and illustrious house but his actions
reflected nothing but disgrace upon his ancestry and threatened to
bring the honours of their line to a period in his person at their
death the bulk of their patrimony devolved upon him this he speedily
consumed in gaming and riot from splendid he descended to meaner vices
the efforts of his sister to recall him to virtue were unintermitted and
fruitless her affection for him he converted into a means of prolonging
his selfish gratifications she decided for the best it was no argument
of weakness that she was so frequently deceived if she had judged truly
of her brother she would have judged not only without example but in
opposition to the general experience of mankind but she was not to be
forever deceived her tenderness was subservient to justice and when
his vices had led him from the gaming-table to the highway when seized
at length by the ministers of law when convicted and sentenced to
transportation her intercession was solicited when all the world knew
that pardon would readily be granted to a suppliant of her rank
fortune and character when the criminal himself his kindred his
friends and even indifferent persons implored her interference her
justice was inflexible she knew full well the incurableness of his
depravity that banishment was the mildest destiny that would befall
him that estrangement from ancient haunts and associates was the
condition from which his true friends had least to fear finding
entreaties unavailing the wretch delivered himself to the suggestions
of his malice and he vowed to be bloodily revenged on her
inflexibility the sentence was executed that character must indeed be
monstrous from which the execution of such threats was to be dreaded
the event sufficiently showed that our fears on this head were well
grounded this event however was at a great distance it was reported
that the felons of whom he was one mutinied on board the ship in which
they had been embarked in the affray that succeeded it was said that
he was killed

among the nefarious deeds which he perpetrated was to be numbered the
seduction of a young lady whose heart was broken by the detection of
his perfidy the fruit of this unhappy union was a daughter her mother
died shortly after her birth her father was careless of her destiny
she was consigned to the care of a hireling who happily for the
innocent victim performed the maternal offices for her own sake and
did not allow the want of a stipulated recompense to render hor cruel or
neglectful

this orphan was sought out by the benevolence of mrs lorimer and placed
under her own protection she received from her the treatment of a
mother the ties of kindred corroborated by habit was not the only
thing that united them that resemblance to herself which had been so
deplorably defective in her brother was completely realized in his
offspring nature seemed to have precluded every difference between them
but that of age this darling object excited in her bosom more than
maternal sympathies her soul clung to the happiness of her
clarice with more ardour than to that of her own son the latter
was not only less worthy of affection but their separation necessarily
diminished their mutual confidence

it was natural for her to look forward to the future destiny of
clarice on these occasions she could not help contemplating the
possibility of a union between her son and niece considerable
advantages belonged to this scheme yet it was the subject of hope
rather than the scope of a project the contingencies were numerous and
delicate on which the ultimate desirableness of this union depended she
was far from certain that her son would be worthy of this benefit or
that if he were worthy his propensities would not select for
themselves a different object it was equally dubious whether the young
lady would not think proper otherwise to dispose of her affections
these uncertainties could be dissipated only by time meanwhile she was
chiefly solicitous to render them virtuous and wise

as they advanced in years the hopes that she had formed were
annihilated the youth was not exempt from egregious errors in addition
to this it was manifest that the young people were disposed to regard
each other in no other light than that of brother and sister i was not
unapprized of her views i saw that their union was impossible i was
near enough to judge of the character of clarice my youth and
intellectual constitution made me peculiarly susceptible to female
charms i was her playfellow in childhood and her associate in studies
and amusements at a maturer age this situation might have been
suspected of a dangerous tendency this tendency however was obviated
by motives of which i was for a long time scarcely conscious

i was habituated to consider the distinctions of rank as indelible the
obstructions that existed to any wish that i might form were like
those of time and space and in their own nature as insuperable

such was the state of things previous to our setting out upon our
travels clarice was indirectly included in our correspondence my
letters were open to her inspection and i was sometimes honoured with a
few complimentary lines under her own hand on returning to my ancient
abode i was once more exposed to those sinister influences which
absence had at least suspended various suitors had meanwhile been
rejected their character for the most part had been such as to
account for her refusal without resorting to the supposition of a
lurking or unavowed attachment

on our meeting she greeted me in a respectful but dignified manner
observers could discover in it nothing not corresponding to that
difference of fortune which subsisted between us if her joy on that
occasion had in it some portion of tenderness the softness of her
temper and the peculiar circumstances in which we had been placed
being considered the most rigid censor could find no occasion for blame
or suspicion

a year passed away but not without my attention being solicited by
something new and inexplicable in my own sensations at first i was not
aware of their true cause but the gradual progress of my feelings left
me not long in doubt as to their origin i was alarmed at the discovery
but my courage did not suddenly desert me my hopes seemed to be
extinguished the moment that i distinctly perceived the point to which
they led my mind had undergone a change the ideas with which it was
fraught wrere varied the sight or recollection of clarice was sure to
occasion my mind to advert to the recent discovery and to revolve the
considerations naturally connected with it some latent glows and secret
trepidations were likewise experienced when by some accident our
meetings were abrupt or our interviews unwitnessed yet my usual
tranquillity was not as yet sensibly diminished i could bear to think
of her marriage with another without painful emotions and was anxious
only that her choice should be judicious and fortunate

my thoughts could not long continue in this state they gradually became
more ardent and museful the image of clarice occurred with unseasonable
frequency its charms were enhanced by some nameless and indefinable
additions when it met me in the way i was irresistibly disposed to stop
and survey it with particular attention the pathetic cast of her
features the deep glow of her cheek and some catch of melting music
she had lately breathed stole incessantly upon my fancy on recovering
from my thoughtful moods i sometimes found my cheeks wet with tears
that had fallen unperceived and my bosom heaved with involuntary sighs
these images did not content themselves with invading my wakeful hours
but likewise encroached upon my sleep i could no longer resign myself
to slumber with the same ease as before when i slept my visions were
of the same impassioned tenor

there was no difficulty in judging rightly of my situation i knew what
it was that duty exacted from me to remain in my present situation was
a chimerical project that time and reflection would suffice to restore
me to myself was a notion equally fallacious yet i felt an
insupportable reluctance to change it this reluctance was owing not
wholly or chiefly to my growing passion but to the attachment which
bound me to the service of my lady all my contemplations had hitherto
been modelled on the belief of my remaining in my present situation
during my life my mildest anticipations had never fashioned an event
like this any misfortune was light in comparison with that which tore
me from her presence and service but should i ultimately resolve to
separate how should i communicate my purpose the pain of parting would
scarcely be less on her side than on mine could i consent to be the
author of disquietude to her i had consecrated all my faculties to her
service this was the recompense which it was in my power to make for
the benefits that i had received would not this procedure bear the
appearance of the basest ingratitude the shadow of an imputation like
this was more excruciating than the rack

what motive could i assign for my conduct the truth must not be told
this would be equivalent to supplicating for a new benefit it would
more become me to lessen than increase my obligations among all my
imaginations on this subject the possibility of a mutual passion never
occurred to me i could not be blind to the essential distinctions that
subsist among men i could expatiate like others on the futility of
ribbons and titles and on the dignity that was annexed to skill and
virtue but these for the most part were the incoherences of
speculation and in no degree influenced the stream of my actions and
practical sentiments the barrier that existed in the present case i
deemed insurmountable this was not even the subject of doubt in
disclosing the truth i should be conceived to be soliciting my lady's
mercy and intercession but this would be the madness of presumption
let me impress her with any other opinion than that i go in search of
the happiness that i have lost under her roof let me save her generous
heart from the pangs which this persuasion would infallibly produce

i could form no stable resolutions i seemed unalterably convinced of
the necessity of separation and yet could not execute my design when i
had wrought up my mind to the intention of explaining myself on the next
interview when the next interview took place my tongue was powerless i
admitted any excuse for postponing my design and gladly admitted any
topic however foreign to my purpose

it must not be imagined that my health sustained no injury from this
conflict of my passions my patroness perceived this alteration she
inquired with the most affectionate solicitude into the cause it could
not be explained i could safely make light of it and represented it as
something which would probably disappear of itself as it originated
without any adequate cause she was obliged to acquiesce in my imperfect
account

day after day passed in this state of fluctuation i was conscious of
the dangers of delay and that procrastination without rendering the
task less necessary augmented its difficulties at length summoning my
resolution i demanded an audience she received me with her usual
affability common topics were started but she saw the confusion and
trepidation of my thoughts and quickly relinquished them she then
noticed to me what she had observed and mentioned the anxiety which
these appearances had given her she reminded me of the maternal regard
which she had always manifested towards me and appealed to my own heart
whether any thing could be said in vindication of that reserve with
which i had lately treated her and urged me as i valued her good
opinion to explain the cause of a dejection that was too
visible

to all this i could make but one answer think me not madam perverse
or ungrateful i came just now to apprize you of a resolution that i had
formed i cannot explain the motives that induce me in this case to
lie to you would be unpardonable and since i cannot assign my true
motives i will not mislead you by false representations i came to
inform you of my intention to leave your service and to retire with
the fruits of your bounty to my native village where i shall spend my
life i hope in peace

her surprise at this declaration was beyond measure she could not
believe her ears she had not heard me rightly she compelled me to
repeat it still i was jesting i could not possibly mean what my words
imported

i assured her in terms still more explicit that my resolution was
taken and was unalterable and again entreated her to spare me the task
of assigning my motives

this was a strange determination what could be the grounds of this new
scheme what could be the necessity of hiding them from her this
mystery was not to be endured she could by no means away with it she
thought it hard that i should abandon her at this time when she stood
in particular need of my assistance and advice she would refuse nothing
to make my situation eligible i had only to point out where she was
deficient in her treatment of me and she would endeavour to supply it
she was willing to augment my emoluments in any degree that i desired
she could not think of parting with me but at any rate she must be
informed of my motives

it is a hard task answered i that i have imposed upon myself i
foresaw its difficulties and this foresight has hitherto prevented me
from undertaking it but the necessity by which i am impelled will no
longer be withstood i am determined to go but to say why is
impossible i hope i shall not bring upon myself the imputation of
ingratitude but this imputation more intolerable than any other must
be borne if it cannot be avoided but by this disclosure

keep your motives to yourself said she i have too good an opinion
of you to suppose that you would practise concealment without good
reason i merely desire you to remain where you are since you will not
tell me why you take up this new scheme i can only say that it is
impossible there should be any advantage in this scheme i will not hear
of it i tell you therefore submit to my decree with a good grace

notwithstanding this prohibition i persisted in declaring that my
determination was fixed and that the motives that governed me would
allow of no alternative

so you will go will you whether i will or no i have no power to
detain you you will regard nothing that i can say

believe me madam no resolution ever was formed after a more vehement
struggle if my motives were known you would not only cease to oppose
but would hasten my departure honour me so far with your good opinion
as to believe that in saying this i say nothing but the truth and
render my duty less burdensome by cheerfully acquiescing in its
dictates

i would replied the lady i could find somebody that has more power
over you than i have whom shall i call in to aid me in this arduous
task

nay dear madam if i can resist your entreaties surely no other can
hope to succeed

i am not sure of that said my friend archly there is one person in
the world whose supplications i greatly suspect you would not
withstand

whom do you mean said i in some trepidation

you will know presently unless i can prevail upon you i shall be
obliged to call for assistance

spare me the pain of repeating that no power on earth can change my
resolution

that's a fib she rejoined with increased archness you know it is
if a certain person entreat you to stay you will easily comply i see i
cannot hope to prevail by my own strength that is a mortifying
consideration but we must not part that is a point settled if nothing
else will do i must go and fetch my advocate stay here a moment

i had scarcely time to breathe before she returned leading in clarice
i did not yet comprehend the meaning of this ceremony the lady was
overwhelmed with sweet confusion averted eyes and reluctant steps might
have explained to me the purpose of this meeting if i had believed that
purpose to be possible i felt the necessity of new fortitude and
struggled to recollect the motives that had hitherto sustained me

there said my patroness i have been endeavouring to persuade this
young man to live with us a little longer he is determined it seems
to change his abode he will not tell why and i do not care to know
unless i could show his reasons to be groundless i have merely
remonstrated with him on the folly of his scheme but he has proved
refractory to all i can say perhaps your efforts may meet with better
success

clarice said not a word my own embarrassment equally disabled me from
speaking regarding us both for some time with a benign aspect mrs
lorimer resumed taking a hand of each and joining them together 

i very well know what it was that suggested this scheme it is strange
that you should suppose me so careless an observer as not to note or
not to understand your situation i am as well acquainted with what is
passing in your heart as you yourself are but why are you so anxious to
conceal it you know less of the adventurousness of love than i should
have suspected but i will not trifle with your feelings

you clithero know the wishes that i once cherished i had hoped that
my son would have found in this darling child an object worthy of his
choice and that my girl would have preferred him to all others but i
have long since discovered that this could not be they are nowise
suited to each other there is one thing in the next place desirable
and now my wishes are accomplished i see that you love each other and
never in my opinion was a passion more rational and just i should
think myself the worst of beings if i did not contribute all in my power
to your happiness there is not the shadow of objection to your union i
know your scruples clithero and am sorry to see that you harbour them
for a moment nothing is more unworthy of your good sense

i found out this girl long ago take my word for it young man she
does not fall short of you in the purity and tenderness of her
attachment what need is there of tedious preliminaries i will leave
you together and hope you will not be long in coming to a mutual
understanding your union cannot be completed too soon for my wishes
clarice is my only and darling daughter as to you clithero expect
henceforth that treatment from me not only to which your own merit
entitles you but which is due to the husband of my daughter with
these words she retired and left us together

great god deliver me from the torments of this remembrance that a
being by whom i was snatched from penury and brutal ignorance exalted
to some rank in the intelligent creation reared to affluence and
honour and thus at last spontaneously endowed with all that remained
to complete the sum of my felicity that a being like this-but such
thoughts must not yet be i must shut them out or i shall never arrive
at the end of my tale my efforts have been thus far successful i have
hitherto been able to deliver a coherent narrative let the last words
that i shall speak afford some glimmering of my better days let me
execute without faltering the only task that remains for me




chapter vi


how propitious how incredible was this event i could scarcely confide
in the testimony of my senses was it true that clarice was before me
that she was prepared to countenance my presumption that she had
slighted obstacles which i had deemed insurmountable that i was fondly
beloved by her and should shortly be admitted to the possession of so
inestimable a good i will not repeat the terms in which i poured forth
at her feet the raptures of my gratitude my impetuosity soon extorted
from clarice a confirmation of her mother's declaration an unrestrained
intercourse was thenceforth established between us dejection and
languor gave place in my bosom to the irradiations of joy and hope my
flowing fortunes seemed to have attained their utmost and immutable
height

alas they were destined to ebb with unspeakably-greater rapidity and
to leave me in a moment stranded and wrecked

our nuptials would have been solemnized without delay had not a
melancholy duty interfered clarice had a friend in a distant part of
the kingdom her health had long been the prey of a consumption she was
now evidently tending to dissolution in this extremity she entreated
her friend to afford her the consolation of her presence the only wish
that remained was to die in her arms

this request could not but be willingly complied with it became me
patiently to endure the delay that would thence arise to the completion
of my wishes considering the urgency and mournfulness of the occasion
it was impossible for me to murmur and the affectionate clarice would
suffer nothing to interfere with the duty which she owed to her dying
friend i accompanied her on this journey remained with her a few days
and then parted from her to return to the metropolis it was not
imagined that it would be necessary to prolong her absence beyond a
month when i bade her farewell and informed her on what day i proposed
to return for her i felt no decay of my satisfaction my thoughts were
bright and full of exultation why was not some intimation afforded me
of the snares that lay in my path in the train laid for my destruction
the agent had so skilfully contrived that my security was not molested
by the faintest omen

i hasten to the crisis of my tale i am almost dubious of my strength
the nearer i approach to it the stronger is my aversion my courage
instead of gathering force as i proceed decays i am willing to dwell
still longer on preliminary circumstances there are other incidents
without which my story would be lame i retail them because they afford
me a kind of respite from horrors at the thought of which every joint in
my frame trembles they must be endured but that infirmity may be
forgiven which makes me inclined to procrastinate my suffering

i mentioned the lover whom my patroness was compelled by the
machinations of her brother to discard more than twenty years had
passed since their separation his birth was mean and he was without
fortune his profession was that of a surgeon my lady not only
prevailed upon him to abandon his country but enabled him to do this by
supplying his necessities from her own purse his excellent
understanding was for a time obscured by passion but it was not
difficult for my lady ultimately to obtain his concurrence to all her
schemes he saw and adored the rectitude of her motives did not disdain
to accept her gifts and projected means for maintaining an epistolary
intercourse during their separation

her interest procured him a post in the service of the east india
company she was from time to time informed of his motions a war
broke out between the company and some of the native powers he was
present at a great battle in which the english were defeated she could
trace him by his letters and by other circumstances thus far but here
the thread was discontinued and no means which she employed could
procure any tidings of him whether he was captive or dead continued
for several years to be merely matter of conjecture

on my return to dublin i found my patroness engaged in conversation
with a stranger she introduced us to each other in a manner that
indicated the respect which she entertained for us both i surveyed and
listened to him with considerable attention his aspect was noble and
ingenuous but his sunburnt and rugged features bespoke a various and
boisterous pilgrimage the furrows of his brow were the products of
vicissitude and hardship rather than of age his accents were fiery and
energetic and the impassioned boldness of his address as well as the
tenor of his discourse full of allusions to the past and regrets that
the course of events had not been different made me suspect something
extraordinary in his character

as soon as he left us my lady explained who he was he was no other
than the object of her youthful attachment who had a few days before
dropped among us as from the skies he had a long and various story to
tell he had accounted for his silence by enumerating the incidents of
his life he had escaped from the prisons of hyder had wandered on
foot and under various disguises through the northern district of
hindostan he was sometimes a scholar of benares and sometimes a
disciple of the mosque according to the exigencies of the times he was
a pilgrim to mecca or to juggernaut by a long circuitous and perilous
route he at length arrived at the turkish capital here he resided for
several years deriving a precarious subsistence from the profession of
a surgeon he was obliged to desert this post in consequence of a duel
between two scotsmen one of them had embraced the greek religion and
was betrothed to the daughter of a wealthy trader of that nation he
perished in the conflict and the family of the lady not only procured
the execution of his antagonist but threatened to involve all those who
were known to be connected with him in the same ruin

his life being thus endangered it became necessary for him to seek a
new residence he fled from constantinople with such precipitation as
reduced him to the lowest poverty he had traversed the indian conquests
of alexander as a mendicant in the same character he now wandered
over the native country of philip and philopoemen he passed safely
through multiplied perils and finally embarking at salonica he
reached venice he descended through the passes of the apennines into
tuscany in this journey he suffered a long detention from banditti by
whom he was waylaid in consequence of his harmless deportment and a
seasonable display of his chirurgical skill they granted him his life
though they for a time restrained him of his liberty and compelled
him to endure their society the time was not misemployed which he spent
immured in caverns and carousing with robbers his details were
eminently singular and curious and evinced the acuteness of his
penetration as well as the steadfastness of his courage

after emerging from these wilds he found his way along the banks of the
arno to leghorn thence he procured a passage to america whence he had
just returned with many additions to his experience but none to his
fortune

this was a remarkable event it did not at first appear how far its
consequences would extend the lady was at present disengaged and
independent though the passion which clouded her early prosperity was
extinct time had not diminished the worth of her friend and they were
far from having reached that age when love becomes chimerical and
marriage folly a confidential intercourse was immediately established
between them the bounty of mrs lorimer soon divested her friend of all
fear of poverty at any rate said she he shall wander no farther
but shall be comfortably situated for the rest of his life all his
scruples were vanquished by the reasonableness of her remonstrances and
the vehemence of her solicitations

a cordial intimacy grew between me and the newly-arrived our interviews
were frequent and our communications without reserve he detailed to me
the result of his experience and expatiated without end on the history
of his actions and opinions he related the adventures of his youth and
dwelt upon all the circumstances of his attachment to my patroness on
this subject i had heard only general details i continually found
cause in the course of his narrative to revere the illustrious
qualities of my lady and to weep at the calamities to which the
infernal malice of her brother had subjected her

the tale of that man's misdeeds amplified and dramatized by the
indignant eloquence of this historian oppressed me with astonishment
if a poet had drawn such a portrait i should have been prone to suspect
the soundness of his judgment till now i had imagined that no character
was uniform and unmixed and my theory of the passions did not enable me
to account for a propensity gratified merely by evil and delighting in
shrieks and agony for their own sake

it was natural to suggest to my friend when expatiating on this theme
an inquiry as to how far subsequent events had obliterated the
impressions that were then made and as to the plausibility of reviving
at this more auspicious period his claims on the heart of his friend
when he thought proper to notice these hints he gave me to understand
that time had made no essential alteration in his sentiments in this
respect that he still fostered a hope to which every day added new
vigour that whatever was the ultimate event he trusted in his
fortitude to sustain it if adverse and in his wisdom to extract from
it the most valuable consequences if it should prove prosperous

the progress of things was not unfavourable to his hopes she treated
his insinuations and professions with levity but her arguments seemed
to be urged with no other view than to afford an opportunity of
confutation and since there was no abatement of familiarity and
kindness there was room to hope that the affair would terminate
agreeably to his wishes




chapter vii


clarice meanwhile was absent her friend seemed at the end of a
month to be little less distant from the grave than at first my
impatience would not allow me to wait till her death i visited her but
was once more obliged to return alone i arrived late in the city and
being greatly fatigued i retired almost immediately to my chamber

on hearing of my arrival sarsefield hastened to see me he came to my
bedside and such in his opinion was the importance of the tidings
which he had to communicate that he did not scruple to rouse me from a
deep sleep  


at this period of his narrative clithero stopped his complexion varied
from one degree of paleness to another his brain appeared to suffer
some severe constriction he desired to be excused for a few minutes
from proceeding in a short time he was relieved from this paroxysm and
resumed his tale with an accent tremulous at first but acquiring
stability and force as he went on 


on waking as i have said i found my friend seated at my bedside his
countenance exhibited various tokens of alarm as soon as i perceived
who it was i started exclaiming what is the matter

he sighed pardon said he this unseasonable intrusion a light
matter would not have occasioned it i have waited for two days past
in an agony of impatience for your return happily you are at last
come i stand in the utmost need of your counsel and aid

heaven defend cried i this is a terrible prelude you may of
course rely upon my assistance and advice what is it that you have to
propose

tuesday evening he answered i spent here it was late before i
returned to my lodgings i was in the act of lifting my hand to the
bell when my eye was caught by a person standing close to the wall at
the distance of ten paces his attitude was that of one employed in
watching my motions his face was turned towards me and happened at
that moment to be fully illuminated by the rays of a globe-lamp that
hung over the door i instantly recognised his features i was
petrified i had no power to execute my design or even to move but
stood for some seconds gazing upon him he was in no degree
disconcerted by the eagerness of my scrutiny he seemed perfectly
indifferent to the consequences of being known at length he slowly
turned his eyes to another quarter but without changing his posture or
the sternness of his looks i cannot describe to you the shock which
this encounter produced in me at last i went into the house and have
ever since been excessively uneasy

i do not see any ground for uneasiness

you do not then suspect who this person is

no

it is arthur wiatte

good heaven it is impossible what my lady's brother

the same

it cannot be were we not assured of his death that he perished in a
mutiny on board the vessel in which he was embarked for transportation

such was rumour which is easily mistaken my eyes cannot be deceived
in this case i should as easily fail to recognise his sister when i
first met her as him this is the man whether once dead or not he is
at present alive and in this city

but has any thing since happened to confirm you in this opinion

yes there has as soon as i had recovered from my first surprise i
began to reflect upon the measures proper to be taken this was the
identical arthur wiatte you know his character no time was likely to
change the principles of such a man but his appearance sufficiently
betrayed the incurableness of his habits the same sullen and atrocious
passions were written in his visage you recollect the vengeance which
wiatte denounced against his sister there is every thing to dread from
his malignity how to obviate the danger i know not i thought
however of one expedient it might serve a present purpose and
something better might suggest itself on your return

i came hither early the next day old gowan the porter is well
acquainted with wiatte's story i mentioned to him that i had reason to
think that he had returned i charged him to have a watchful eye upon
every one that knocked at the gate and that if this person should
come by no means to admit him the old man promised faithfully to abide
by my directions his terrors indeed were greater than mine and he
knew the importance of excluding wiatte from these walls

did you not inform my lady of this

no in what way could i tell it to her what end could it answer why
should i make her miserable but i have not done yesterday morning
gowan took me aside and informed me that wiatte had made his
appearance the day before at the gate he knew him he said in a
moment he demanded to see the lady but the old man told him she was
engaged and could not be seen he assumed peremptory and haughty airs
and asserted that his business was of such importance as not to endure a
moment's delay gowan persisted in his first refusal he retired with
great reluctance but said he should return to-morrow when he should
insist upon admission to the presence of the lady i have inquired and
find that he has not repeated his visit what is to be done

i was equally at a loss with my friend this incident was so
unlooked-for what might not be dreaded from the monstrous depravity of
wiatte his menaces of vengeance against his sister still rung in my ears
some means of eluding them were indispensable could law be resorted to
against an evil like this no legal provision had been made nine years
had elapsed since his transportation seven years was the period of his
exile in returning therefore he had committed no crime his person
could not be lawfully molested we were justified merely in repelling an
attack but suppose we should appeal to law could this be done without
the knowledge and concurrence of the lady she would never permit it
her heart was incapable of fear from this quarter she would spurn at
the mention of precautions against the hatred of her brother her
inquietude would merely be awakened on his own account

i was overwhelmed with perplexity perhaps if he were sought out and
some judgment formed of the kind of danger to be dreaded from him by a
knowledge of his situation and views some expedient might be thence
suggested

but how should his haunts be discovered this was easy he had intimated
the design of applying again for admission to his sister let a person
be stationed near at hand who being furnished with an adequate
description of his person and dress shall mark him when he comes and
follow him when he retires and shall forthwith impart to us the
information on that head which he shall be able to collect

my friend concurred in this scheme no better could for the present be
suggested here ended our conference

i was thus supplied with a new subject of reflection it was calculated
to fill my mind with dreary forebodings the future was no longer a
scene of security and pleasure it would be hard for those to partake of
our fears who did not partake of our experience the existence of wiatte
was the canker that had blasted the felicity of my patroness in his
reappearance on the stage there was something portentous it seemed to
include in it consequences of the utmost moment without my being able
to discover what these consequences were

that sarsefield should be so quickly followed by his arch-foe that they
started anew into existence without any previous intimation in a
manner wholly unexpected and at the same period it seemed as if there
lurked under those appearances a tremendous significance which human
sagacity could not uncover my heart sunk within me when i reflected
that this was the father of my clarice he by whose cruelty her mother
was torn from the enjoyment of untarnished honour and consigned to
infamy and an untimely grave he by whom herself was abandoned in the
helplessness of infancy and left to be the prey of obdurate avarice
and the victim of wretches who traffic in virgin innocence who had done
all that in him lay to devote her youth to guilt and misery what were
the limits of his power how may he exert the parental prerogatives

to sleep while these images were haunting me was impossible i passed
the night in continual motion i strode without ceasing across the
floor of my apartment my mind was wrought to a higher pitch than i had
ever before experienced the occasion accurately considered was far
from justifying the ominous inquietudes which i then felt how then
should i account for them

sarsefield probably enjoyed his usual slumber his repose might not be
perfectly serene but when he ruminated on impending or possible
calamities his tongue did not cleave to his mouth his throat was not
parched with unquenchable thirst he was not incessantly stimulated to
employ his superfluous fertility of thought in motion if i trembled for
the safety of her whom i loved and whose safety was endangered by being
the daughter of this miscreant had he not equal reason to fear for her
whom he also loved and who as the sister of this ruffian was
encompassed by the most alarming perils yet he probably was calm while
i was harassed by anxieties

alas the difference was easily explained such was the beginning of a
series ordained to hurry me to swift destruction such were the primary
tokens of the presence of that power by whose accursed machinations i
was destined to fall you are startled at this declaration it is one to
which you have been little accustomed perhaps you regard it merely as
an effusion of frenzy i know what i am saying i do not build upon
conjectures and surmises i care not indeed for your doubts your
conclusion may be fashioned at your pleasure would to heaven that my
belief were groundless and that i had no reason to believe my
intellects to have been perverted by diabolical instigations

i could procure no sleep that night after sarsefield's departure i did
not even lie down it seemed to me that i could not obtain the benefits
of repose otherwise than by placing my lady beyond the possibility of
danger

i met sarsefield the next day in pursuance of the scheme which had been
adopted by us on the preceding evening a person was selected and
commissioned to watch the appearance of wiatte the day passed as usual
with respect to the lady in the evening she was surrounded by a few
friends into this number i was now admitted sarsefield and myself made
a part of this company various topics were discussed with ease and
sprightliness her societies were composed of both sexes and seemed to
have monopolized all the ingenuity and wit that existed in the
metropolis

after a slight repast the company dispersed this separation took place
earlier than usual on account of a slight indisposition in mrs
lorimer sarsefield and i went out together we took that
opportunity of examining our agent and receiving no satisfaction from
him we dismissed him for that night enjoining him to hold himself in
readiness for repeating the experiment to-morrow my friend directed his
steps homeward and i proceeded to execute a commission with which i had
charged myself

a few days before a large sum had been deposited in the hands of a
banker for the use of my lady it was the amount of a debt which had
lately been recovered it was lodged here for the purpose of being paid
on demand of her or her agents it was my present business to receive
this money i had deferred the performance of this engagement to this
late hour on account of certain preliminaries which were necessary to
be adjusted

having received this money i prepared to return home the inquietude
which had been occasioned by sarsefield's intelligence had not
incapacitated me from performing my usual daily occupations it was a
theme to which at every interval of leisure from business or discourse
i did not fail to return at those times i employed myself in examining
the subject on all sides in supposing particular emergencies and
delineating the conduct that was proper to be observed on each my daily
thoughts were by no means so fear-inspiring as the meditations of the
night had been

as soon as i left the banker's door my meditations fell into this
channel i again reviewed the recent occurrences and imagined the
consequences likely to flow from them my deductions were not on this
occasion peculiarly distressful the return of darkness had added
nothing to my apprehensions i regarded wiatte merely as one against
whose malice it was wise to employ the most vigilant precautions in
revolving these precautions nothing occurred that was new the danger
appeared without unusual aggravations and the expedients that offered
themselves to my choice were viewed with a temper not more sanguine or
despondent than before

in this state of mind i began and continued my walk the distance was
considerable between my own habitation and that which i had left my way
lay chiefly through populous and well-frequented streets in one part of
the way however it was at the option of the passenger either to keep
along the large streets or considerably to shorten the journey by
turning into a dark crooked and narrow lane being familiar with every
part of this metropolis and deeming it advisable to take the shortest
and obscurest road i turned into the alley i proceeded without
interruption to the next turning one night-officer distinguished by
his usual ensigns was the only person who passed me i had gone three
steps beyond when i perceived a man by my side i had scarcely time to
notice this circumstance when a hoarse voice exclaimed damn ye
villain ye're a dead man

at the same moment a pistol flashed at my ear and a report followed
this however produced no other effect than for a short space to
overpower my senses i staggered back but did not fall

the ball as i afterwards discovered had grazed my forehead but
without making any dangerous impression the assassin perceiving that
his pistol had been ineffectual muttered in an enraged tone this
shall do your business at the same time he drew a knife forth from
his bosom

i was able to distinguish this action by the rays of a distant lamp
which glistened on the blade all this passed in an instant the attack
was so abrupt that my thoughts could not be suddenly recalled from the
confusion into which they were thrown my exertions were mechanical my
will might be said to be passive and it was only by retrospect and a
contemplation of consequences that i became fully informed of the nature
of the scene

if my assailant had disappeared as soon as he had discharged the pistol
my state of extreme surprise might have slowly given place to resolution
and activity as it was my sense was no sooner struck by the reflection
from the blade than my hand as if by spontaneous energy was thrust
into my pocket i drew forth a pistol

he lifted up his weapon to strike but it dropped from his powerless
fingers he fell and his groans informed me that i had managed my arms
with more skill than my adversary the noise of this encounter soon
attracted spectators lights were brought and my antagonist discovered
bleeding at my feet i explained as briefly as i was able the scene
which they witnessed the prostrate person was raised by two men and
carried into a public house nigh at hand

i had not lost my presence of mind i at once perceived the propriety of
administering assistance to the wounded man i despatched therefore
one of the bystanders for a surgeon of considerable eminence who lived
at a small distance and to whom i was well known the man was carried
into an inner apartment and laid upon the floor it was not till now
that i had a suitable opportunity of ascertaining who it was with whom i
had been engaged i now looked upon his face the paleness of death
could not conceal his well-known features it was wiatte himself who was
breathing his last groans at my feet

the surgeon whom i had summoned attended but immediately perceived
the condition of his patient to be hopeless in a quarter of an hour he
expired during this interval he was insensible to all around him i
was known to the surgeon the landlord and some of the witnesses the
case needed little explanation the accident reflected no guilt upon me
the landlord was charged with the care of the corpse till the morning
and i was allowed to return home without further impediment




chapter viii


till now my mind had been swayed by the urgencies of this occasion
these reflections were excluded which rushed tumultuously upon me the
moment i was at leisure to receive them without foresight of a previous
moment an entire change had been wrought in my condition

i had been oppressed with a sense of the danger that flowed from the
existence of this man by what means the peril could be annihilated and
we be placed in security from his attempts no efforts of mind could
suggest to devise these means and employ them with success demanded
as i conceived the most powerful sagacity and the firmest courage now
the danger was no more the intelligence in which plans of mischief
might be generated was extinguished or flown lifeless were the hands
ready to execute the dictates of that intelligence the contriver of
enormous evil was in one moment bereft of the power and the will to
injure our past tranquillity had been owing to the belief of his death
fear and dismay had resumed their dominion when the mistake was
discovered but now we might regain possession of our wonted confidence
i had beheld with my own eyes the lifeless corpse of our implacable
adversary thus in a moment had terminated his long and flagitious
career his restless indignation his malignant projects that had so
long occupied the stage and been so fertile of calamity were now at an
end

in the course of my meditations the idea of the death of this man had
occurred and it bore the appearance of a desirable event yet it was
little qualified to tranquillize my fears in the long catalogue of
contingencies this indeed was to be found but it was as little
likely to happen as any other it could not happen without a series of
anterior events paving the way for it if his death came from us it
must be the theme of design it must spring from laborious circumvention
and deep-laid stratagems

no he was dead i had killed him what had i done i had meditated
nothing i was impelled by an unconscious necessity had the assailant
been my father the consequence would have been the same my
understanding had been neutral could it be in a space so short was it
possible that so tremendous a deed had been executed was i not deceived
by some portentous vision i had witnessed the convulsions and last
agonies of wiatte he was no more and i was his destroyer

such was the state of my mind for some time after this dreadful event
previously to it i was calm considerate and self-collected i marked
the way that i was going passing objects were observed if i adverted
to the series of my own reflections my attention was not seized and
fastened by them i could disengage myself at pleasure and could pass
without difficulty from attention to the world within to the
contemplation of that without

now my liberty in this respect was at an end i was fettered
confounded smitten with excess of thought and laid prostrate with
wonder i no longer attended to my steps when i emerged from my stupor
i found that i had trodden back the way which i had lately come and had
arrived within sight of the banker's door i checked myself and once
more turned my steps homeward

this seemed to be a hint for entering into new reflections the deed
said i is irretrievable i have killed the brother of my patroness
the father of my love

this suggestion was new it instantly involved me in terror and
perplexity how shall i communicate the tidings what effect will they
produce my lady's sagacity is obscured by the benevolence of her
temper her brother was sordidly wicked a hoary ruffian to whom the
language of pity was as unintelligible as the gabble of monkeys his
heart was fortified against compunction by the atrocious habits of
forty years he lived only to interrupt her peace to confute the
promises of virtue and convert to rancour and reproach the fair dame of
fidelity

he was her brother still as a human being his depravity was never
beyond the health-restoring power of repentance his heart so long as
it beat was accessible to remorse the singularity of his birth had
made her regard this being as more intimately her brother than would
have happened in different circumstances it was her obstinate
persuasion that their fates were blended the rumour of his death she
had never credited it was a topic of congratulation to her friends but
of mourning and distress to her that he would one day reappear upon the
stage and assume the dignity of virtue was a source of consolation
with which she would never consent to part

her character was now known when the doom of exile was pronounced upon
him she deemed it incumbent on her to vindicate herself from aspersions
founded on misconceptions of her motives in refusing her interference
the manuscript though unpublished was widely circulated none could
resist her simple and touching eloquence nor rise from the perusal
without resigning his heart to the most impetuous impulses of
admiration and enlisting himself among the eulogists of her justice and
her fortitude this was the only monument in a written form of her
genius as such it was engraven on my memory the picture that it
described was the perpetual companion of my thoughts

alas it had perhaps been well for me if it had been buried in eternal
oblivion i read in it the condemnation of my deed the agonies she was
preparing to suffer and the indignation that would overflow upon the
author of so signal a calamity

i had rescued my life by the sacrifice of his whereas i should have
died wretched and precipitate coward what had become of my boasted
gratitude such was the zeal that i had vowed to her such the services
which it was the business of my life to perform i had snatched her
brother from existence i had torn from her the hope which she so
ardently and indefatigably cherished from a contemptible and dastardly
regard to my own safety i had failed in the moment of trial and when
called upon by heaven to evince the sincerity of my professions

she had treated my professions lightly my vows of eternal devotion she
had rejected with lofty disinterestedness she had arraigned my
impatience of obligation as criminal and condemned every scheme i had
projected for freeing myself from the burden which her beneficence had
laid upon me the impassioned and vehement anxiety with which in former
days she had deprecated the vengeance of her lover against wiatte rung
in my ears my senses were shocked anew by the dreadful sounds touch
not my brother wherever you meet with him of whatever outrage he be
guilty suffer him to pass in safety despise me abandon me kill me
all this i can bear even from you but spare i implore you my unhappy
brother the stroke that deprives him of life will not only have the
same effect upon me but will set my portion in everlasting misery

to these supplications i had been deaf it is true i had not rushed upon
him unarmed intending no injury nor expecting any of that degree of
wickedness i was perhaps incapable alas i have immersed myself
sufficiently deep in crimes i have trampled under foot every motive
dear to the heart of honour i have shown myself unworthy the society of
men

such were the turbulent suggestions of that moment my pace slackened i
stopped and was obliged to support myself against a wall the sickness
that had seized my heart penetrated every part of my frame there was
but one thing wanting to complete my distraction my lady said i
believed her fate to be blended with that of wiatte who shall affirm
that the persuasion is a groundless one she had lived and prospered
notwithstanding the general belief that her brother was dead she would
not hearken to the rumour why because nothing less than indubitable
evidence would suffice to convince her because the counter-intimation
flowed from an infallible source how can the latter supposition be
confuted has she not predicted the event

the period of terrible fulfilment has arrived the same blow that
bereaved him of life has likewise ratified her doom

she has been deceived it is nothing more perhaps than a fond
imagination it matters not who knows not the cogency of faith that
the pulses of life are at the command of the will the bearer of these
tidings will be the messenger of death a fatal sympathy will seize her
she will shrink and swoon and perish at the news

fond and short-sighted wretch this is the price thou hast given for
security in the rashness of thy thought thou saidst nothing is
wanting but his death to restore us to confidence and safety lo the
purchase is made havoc and despair that were restrained during his
life were let loose by his last sigh now only is destruction made
sure thy lady thy clarice thy friend and thyself are by this act
involved in irretrievable and common ruin

i started from my attitude i was scarcely conscious of any transition
the interval was fraught with stupor and amazement it seemed as if my
senses had been hushed in sleep while the powers of locomotion were
unconsciously exerted to bear me to my chamber by whatever means the
change was effected there i was

i have been able to proceed thus far i can scarcely believe the
testimony of my memory that assures me of this my task is almost
executed but whence shall i obtain strength enough to finish it what i
have told is light as gossamer compared with the insupportable and
crushing horrors of that which is to come heaven in token of its
vengeance will enable me to proceed it is fitting that my scene should
thus close

my fancy began to be infected with the errors of my understanding the
mood into which my mind was plunged was incapable of any propitious
intermission all within me was tempestuous and dark my ears were
accessible to no sounds but those of shrieks and lamentations it was
deepest midnight and all the noises of a great metropolis were hushed
yet i listened as if to catch some strain of the dirge that was begun
sable robes sobs and a dreary solemnity encompassed me on all sides i
was haunted to despair by images of death imaginary clamours and the
train of funeral pageantry i seemed to have passed forward to a distant
era of my life the effects which were come were already realized the
foresight of misery created it and set me in the midst of that hell
which i feared

from a paroxysm like this the worst might reasonably be dreaded yet the
next step to destruction was not suddenly taken i paused on the brink
of the precipice as if to survey the depth of that frenzy that invaded
me was able to ponder on the scene and deliberate in a state that
partook of calm on the circumstances of my situation my mind was
harassed by the repetition of one idea conjecture deepened into
certainty i could place the object in no light which did not
corroborate the persuasion that in the act committed i had insured the
destruction of my lady at length my mind somewhat relieved from the
tempest of my fears began to trace and analyze the consequences which i
dreaded

the fate of wiatte would inevitably draw along with it that of his
sister in what way would this effect be produced were they linked
together by a sympathy whose influence was independent of sensible
communication could she arrive at a knowledge of his miserable and by
other than verbal means i had heard of such extraordinary
copartnerships in being and modes of instantaneous intercourse among
beings locally distant was this a new instance of the subtlety of mind
had she already endured his agonies and like him already ceased to
breathe

every hair bristled at this horrible suggestion but the force of
sympathy might be chimerical buried in sleep or engaged in careless
meditation the instrument by which her destiny might be accomplished
was the steel of an assassin a series of events equally beyond the
reach of foresight with those which had just happened might introduce
with equal abruptness a similar disaster what at that moment was her
condition reposing in safety in her chamber as her family imagined
but were they not deceived was she not a mangled corpse whatever were
her situation it could not be ascertained except by extraordinary
means till the morning was it wise to defer the scrutiny till then
why not instantly investigate the truth

these ideas passed rapidly through my mind a considerable portion of
time and amplification of phrase are necessary to exhibit verbally
ideas contemplated in a space of incalculable brevity with the same
rapidity i conceived the resolution of determining the truth of my
suspicions all the family but myself were at rest winding passages
would conduct me without danger of disturbing them to the hall from
which double staircases ascended one of these led to a saloon above on
the east side of which was a door that communicated with a suite of
rooms occupied by the lady of the mansion the first was an antechamber
in which a female servant usually lay the second was the lady's own
bedchamber this was a sacred recess with whose situation relative to
the other apartments of the building i was well acquainted but of
which i knew nothing from my own examination having never been admitted
into it

thither i was now resolved to repair i was not deterred by the sanctity
of the place and hour i was insensible to all consequences but the
removal of my doubts not that my hopes were balanced by my fears that
the same tragedy had been performed in her chamber and in the street
nothing hindered me from believing with as much cogency as if my own
eyes had witnessed it but the reluctance with which we admit a
detestable truth

to terminate a state of intolerable suspense i resolved to proceed
forthwith to her chamber i took the light and paced with no
interruption along the galleries i used no precaution if i had met a
servant or robber i am not sure that i should have noticed him my
attention was too perfectly engrossed to allow me to spare any to a
casual object i cannot affirm that no one observed me this however
was probable from the distribution of the dwelling it consisted of a
central edifice and two wings one of which was appropriated to
domestics and the other at the extremity of which my apartment was
placed comprehended a library and rooms for formal and social and
literary conferences these therefore were deserted at night and my
way lay along these hence it was not likely that my steps would be
observed

i proceeded to the hall the principal parlour was beneath her chamber
in the confusion of my thoughts i mistook one for the other i
rectified as soon as i detected my mistake i ascended with a beating
heart the staircase the door of the antechamber was unfastened i
entered totally regardless of disturbing the girl who slept within the
bed which she occupied was concealed by curtains whether she were
there i did not stop to examine i cannot recollect that any tokens
were given of wakefulness or alarm it was not till i reached the door
of her own apartment that my heart began to falter

it was now that the momentousness of the question i was about to decide
rushed with its genuine force upon my apprehension appalled and aghast
i had scarcely power to move the bolt if the imagination of her death
was not to be supported how should i bear the spectacle of wounds and
blood yet this was reserved for me a few paces would set me in the
midst of a scene of which i was the abhorred contriver was it right to
proceed there were still the remnants of doubt my forebodings might
possibly be groundless all within might be safety and serenity a
respite might be gained from the execution of an irrevocable sentence
what could i do was not any thing easy to endure in comparison with the
agonies of suspense if i could not obviate the evil i must bear it but
the torments of suspense were susceptible of remedy

i drew back the bolt and entered with the reluctance of fear rather
than the cautiousness of guilt i could not lift my eyes from the
ground i advanced to the middle of the room not a sound like that of
the dying saluted my-ear at length shaking off the fetters of
hopelessness i looked up

i saw nothing calculated to confirm my fears everywhere there reigned
quiet and order my heart leaped with exultation can it be said i
that i have been betrayed with shadows but this is not sufficient

within an alcove was the bed that belonged to her if her safety were
inviolate it was here that she reposed what remained to convert
tormenting doubt into ravishing certainty i was insensible to the
perils of my present situation if she indeed were there would not my
intrusion awaken her she would start and perceive me at this hour
standing at her bedside how should i account for an intrusion so
unexampled and audacious i could not communicate my fears i could not
tell her that the blood with which my hands were stained had flowed from
the wounds of her brother

my mind was inaccessible to such considerations they did not even
modify my predominant idea obstacles like these had they existed
would have been trampled under foot

leaving the lamp that i bore on the table i approached the bed i
slowly drew aside the curtain and beheld her tranquilly slumbering i
listened but so profound was her sleep that not even her breathings
could be overheard i dropped the curtain and retired

how blissful and mild were the illuminations of my bosom at this
discovery a joy that surpassed all utterance succeeded the fierceness
of desperation i stood for some moments wrapped in delightful
contemplation alas it was a luminous but transient interval the
madness to whose black suggestions it bore so strong a contrast began
now to make sensible approaches on my understanding

true said i she lives her slumber is serene and happy she is
blind to her approaching destiny some hours will at least be rescued
from anguish and death when she wakes the phantom that soothed her
will vanish the tidings cannot be withheld from her the murderer of
thy brother cannot hope to enjoy thy smiles those ravishing accents
with which thou hast used to greet me will be changed scowling and
reproaches the invectives of thy anger and the maledictions of thy
justice will rest upon my head

what is the blessing which i made the theme of my boastful arrogance
this interval of being and repose is momentary she will awake but only
to perish at the spectacle of my ingratitude she will awake only to the
consciousness of instantly-impending death when she again sleeps she
will wake no more i her son i whom the law of my birth doomed to
poverty and hardship but whom her unsolicited beneficence snatched from
those evils and endowed with the highest good known to intelligent
beings the consolations of science and the blandishments of
affluence to whom the darling of her life the offspring in whom are
faithfully preserved the lineaments of its angelic mother she has not
denied what is the recompense that i have made how have i discharged
the measureless debt of gratitude to which she is entitled thus 

cannot my guilt be extenuated is there not a good that i can do thee
must i perpetrate unmingled evil is the province assigned me that of an
infernal emissary whose efforts are concentred in a single purpose and
that purpose a malignant one i am the author of thy calamities
whatever misery is reserved for thee i am the source whence it flows
can i not set bounds to the stream cannot i prevent thee from returning
to a consciousness which till it ceases to exist will not cease to be
rent and mangled

yes it is in my power to screen thee from the coming storm to
accelerate thy journey to rest i will do it

the impulse was not to be resisted i moved with the suddenness of
lightning armed with a pointed implement that lay  it was a dagger
as i set down the lamp i struck the edge yet i saw it not or noticed
it not till i needed its assistance by what accident it came hither to
what deed of darkness it had already been subservient i had no power to
inquire i stepped to the table and seized it

the time which this action required was insufficient to save me my doom
was ratified by powers which no human energies can counterwork need i
go further did you entertain any imagination of so frightful a
catastrophe i am overwhelmed by turns with dismay and with wonder i am
prompted by turns to tear my heart from my breast and deny faith to the
verdict of my senses

was it i that hurried to the deed no it was the demon that possessed
me my limbs were guided to the bloody office by a power foreign and
superior to mine i had been defrauded for a moment of the empire of
my muscles a little moment for that sufficed if my destruction had
not been decreed why was the image of clarice so long excluded yet why
do i say long the fatal resolution was conceived and i hastened to the
execution in a period too brief for more than itself to be viewed by
the intellect

what then were my hands imbrued in this precious blood was it to this
extremity of horror that my evil genius was determined to urge me too
surely this was his purpose too surely i was qualified to be its
minister

i lifted the weapon its point was aimed at the bosom of the sleeper
the impulse was given

at the instant a piercing shriek was uttered behind me and a
stretched-out hand grasping the blade made it swerve widely from its
aim it descended but without inflicting a wound its force was spent
upon the bed

oh for words to paint that stormy transition i loosed my hold of the
dagger i started back and fixed eyes of frantic curiosity on the
author of my rescue he that interposed to arrest my deed that started
into being and activity at a moment so pregnant with fate without
tokens of his purpose or his coming being previously imparted could
not methought be less than divinity

the first glance that i darted on this being corroborated my conjecture
it was the figure and lineaments of mrs lorimer negligently habited in
flowing and brilliant white with features bursting with terror and
wonder the likeness of that being who was stretched upon the bed now
stood before me

all that i am able to conceive of angel was comprised in the moral
constitution of this woman that her genius had overleaped all bounds
and interposed to save her was no audacious imagination in the state
in which my mind then was no other belief than this could occupy the
first place

my tongue was tied i gazed by turns upon her who stood before me and
her who lay upon the bed and who awakened by the shriek that had been
uttered now opened her eyes she started from her pillow and by
assuming a new and more distinct attitude permitted me to recognise
clarice herself

three days before i had left her beside the bed of a dying friend at
a solitary mansion in the mountains of donegal here it had been her
resolution to remain till her friend should breathe her last fraught
with this persuasion knowing this to be the place and hour of repose of
my lady hurried forward by the impetuosity of my own conceptions
deceived by the faint gleam which penetrated through the curtain and
imperfectly-irradiated features which bore at all times a powerful
resemblance to those of mrs lorimer i had rushed to the brink of this
terrible precipice

why did i linger on the verge why thus perilously situated did i not
throw myself headlong the steel was yet in my hand a single blow would
have pierced my heart and shut out from my remembrance and foresight
the past and the future

the moment of insanity had gone by and i was once more myself instead
of regarding the act which i had meditated as the dictate of compassion
or of justice it only added to the sum of my ingratitude and gave
wings to the whirlwind that was sent to bear me to perdition

perhaps i was influenced by a sentiment which i had not leisure to
distribute into parts my understanding was no doubt bewildered in the
maze of consequences which would spring from my act how should i
explain my coming hither in this murderous guise my arm lifted to
destroy the idol of my soul and the darling child of my patroness in
what words should i unfold the tale of wiatte and enumerate the motives
that terminated in the present scene what penalty had not my
infatuation and cruelty deserved what could i less than turn the
dagger's point against my own bosom

a second time the blow was thwarted and diverted once more this
beneficent interposer held my arm from the perpetration of a new
iniquity once more frustrated the instigations of that demon of whose
malice a mysterious destiny had consigned me to be the sport and the
prey

every new moment added to the sum of my inexpiable guilt murder was
succeeded in an instant by the more detestable enormity of suicide
she to whom my ingratitude was flagrant in proportion to the benefits of
which she was the author had now added to her former acts that of
rescuing me from the last of mischiefs

i threw the weapon on the floor the zeal which prompted her to seize my
arm this action occasioned to subside and to yield place to those
emotions which this spectacle was calculated to excite she watched me
in silence and with an air of ineffable solicitude clarice governed
by the instinct of modesty wrapped her bosom and face in the
bedclothes and testified her horror by vehement but scarcely-articulate
exclamations

i moved forward but my steps were random and tottering my thoughts
were fettered by reverie and my gesticulations destitute of meaning my
tongue faltered without speaking and i felt as if life and death were
struggling within me for the mastery

my will indeed was far from being neutral in this contest to such as
i annihilation is the supreme good to shake off the ills that fasten
on us by shaking off existence is a lot which the system of nature has
denied to man by escaping from life i should be delivered from this
scene but should only rush into a world of retribution and be immersed
in new agonies

i was yet to live no instrument of my deliverance was within reach i
was powerless to rush from the presence of these women to hide me
forever from their scrutiny and their upbraiding to snatch from their
minds all traces of the existence of clithero was the scope of
unutterable longings

urged to flight by every motive of which my nature was susceptible i
was yet rooted to the spot had the pause been only to be interrupted by
me it would have lasted forever

at length the lady clasping her hands and lifting them exclaimed in
a tone melting into pity and grief 

clithero what is this how came you hither and why

i struggled for utterance i came to murder you your brother has
perished by my hands fresh from the commission of this deed i have
hastened hither to perpetrate the same crime upon you

my brother replied the lady with new vehemence oh say not so i
have just heard of his return from sarsefield and that he lives

he is dead repeated i with fierceness i know it it was i that
killed him

dead she faintly articulated and by thee clithero oh cursed
chance that hindered thee from killing me also dead then is the omen
fulfilled then am i undone lost forever

her eyes now wandered from me and her countenance sunk into a wild and
rueful expression hope was utterly extinguished in her heart and life
forsook her at the same moment she sunk upon the floor pallid and
breathless

how she came into possession of this knowledge i know not it is
possible that sarsefield had repented of concealment and in the
interval that passed between our separation and my encounter with
wiatte had returned and informed her of the reappearance of this
miscreant

thus then was my fate consummated i was rescued from destroying her
by a dagger only to behold her perish by the tidings which i brought
thus was every omen of mischief and misery fulfilled thus was the
enmity of wiatte rendered efficacious and the instrument of his
destruction changed into the executioner of his revenge

such is the tale of my crimes it is not for me to hope that the curtain
of oblivion will ever shut out the dismal spectacle it will haunt me
forever the torments that grow out of it can terminate only with the
thread of my existence but that i know full well will never end
death is but a shifting of the scene and the endless progress of
eternity which to the good is merely the perfection of felicity is to
the wicked an accumulation of woe the self-destroyer is his own enemy
this has ever been my opinion hitherto it has influenced my actions
now though the belief continues its influence on my conduct is
annihilated i am no stranger to the depth of that abyss into which i
shall plunge no matter change is precious for its own sake

well i was still to live my abode must be somewhere fixed my conduct
was henceforth the result of a perverse and rebellious principle i
banished myself forever from my native soil i vowed never more to
behold the face of my clarice to abandon my friends my books all my
wonted labours and accustomed recreations

i was neither ashamed nor afraid i considered not in what way the
justice of the country would affect me it merely made no part of my
contemplations i was not embarrassed by the choice of expedients for
trammelling up the visible consequences and for eluding suspicion the
idea of abjuring my country and flying forever from the hateful scene
partook to my apprehension of the vast the boundless and strange of
plunging from the height of fortune to obscurity and indigence
corresponded with my present state of mind it was of a piece with the
tremendous and wonderful events that had just happened

these were the images that haunted me while i stood speechlessly gazing
at the ruin before me i heard a noise from without or imagined that i
heard it my reverie was broken and my muscular power restored i
descended into the street through doors of which i possessed one set of
keys and hurried by the shortest way beyond the precincts of the city
i had laid no plan my conceptions with regard to the future were
shapeless and confused successive incidents supplied me with a clue
and suggested as they rose the next step to be taken i threw off the
garb of affluence and assumed a beggar's attire that i had money about
me for the accomplishment of my purposes was wholly accidental i
travelled along the coast and when i arrived at one town knew not why
i should go farther but my restlessness was unabated and change was
some relief i it length arrived at belfast a vessel was preparing for
america i embraced eagerly the opportunity of passing into a new world
i arrived at philadelphia as soon as i landed i wandered hither and
was content to wear out my few remaining days in the service of
inglefield

i have no friends why should i trust my story to mother i have no
solicitude about concealment but who is there who will derive pleasure
or benefit from my rehearsal and why should i expatiate on so hateful a
scheme yet now have i consented to this i have confided in you the
history of my disasters i am not fearful of the use that you may be
disposed to make of it i shall quickly set myself beyond the reach of
human tribunals i shall relieve the ministers of law from the trouble
of punishing the recent events which induced you to summon me to this
conference have likewise determined me to make this disclosure

i was not aware for some time of my perturbed sleep no wonder that
sleep cannot soothe miseries like mine that i am alike infested by
memory in wakefulness and slumber yet i was anew distressed by the
discovery that my thoughts found their way to my lips without my being
conscious of it and that my steps wandered forth unknowingly and
without the guidance of my will

the story you have told is not incredible the disaster to which you
allude did not fail to excite my regret i can still weep over the
untimely fall of youth and worth i can no otherwise account for my
frequenting his shade than by the distant resemblance which the death of
this man bore to that of which i was the perpetrator this resemblance
occurred to me at first if he were able to weaken the impression which
was produced by my crime this similitude was adapted to revive and
enforce them

the wilderness and the cave to which you followed me were familiar to
my sunday rambles often have i indulged in audible griefs on the cliffs
of that valley often have i brooded over my sorrows in the recesses of
that cavern this scene is adapted to my temper its mountainous
asperities supply me with images of desolation and seclusion and its
headlong streams lull me into temporary forgetfulness of mankind

i comprehend you you suspect me of concern in the death of waldegrave
you could not do otherwise the conduct that you have witnessed was that
of a murderer i will not upbraid you for your suspicions though i have
bought exemption from them at a high price




chapter ix


there ended his narrative he started from the spot where he stood and
without affording me any opportunity of replying or commenting
disappeared amidst the thickest of the wood i had no time to exert
myself for his detention i could have used no arguments for this end
to which it is probable he would have listened the story i had heard
was too extraordinary too completely the reverse of all my
expectations to allow me to attend to the intimations of self-murder
which he dropped

the secret which i imagined was about to be disclosed was as inscrutable
as ever not a circumstance from the moment when clithero's character
became the subject of my meditations till the conclusion of his talk
but served to confirm my suspicion was this error to be imputed to
credulity would not any one from similar appearances have drawn
similar conclusions or is there a criterion by which truth can always
be distinguished was it owing to my imperfect education that the
inquietudes of this man were not traced to a deed performed at the
distance of a thousand leagues to the murder of his patroness and
friend

i had heard a tale which apparently related to scenes and persons far
distant but though my suspicions have appeared to have been misplaced
what should hinder but that the death of my friend was in like manner
an act of momentary insanity and originated in a like spirit of mistaken
benevolence

but i did not consider this tale merely in relation to myself my life
had been limited and uniform i had communed with romancers and
historians but the impression made upon me by this incident was
unexampled in my experience my reading had furnished me with no
instance in any degree parallel to this and i found that to be a
distant and second-hand spectator of events was widely different from
witnessing them myself and partaking in their consequences my judgment
was for a time sunk into imbecility and confusion my mind was full of
the images unavoidably suggested by this tale but they existed in a
kind of chaos and not otherwise than gradually was i able to reduce
them to distinct particulars and subject them to a deliberate and
methodical inspection

how was i to consider this act of clithero what a deplorable
infatuation yet it was the necessary result of a series of ideas
mutually linked and connected his conduct was dictated by a motive
allied to virtue it was the fruit of an ardent and grateful spirit

the death of wiatte could not be censured the life of clithero was
unspeakably more valuable than that of his antagonist it was the
instinct of self-preservation that swayed him he knew not his adversary
in time enough to govern himself by that knowledge had the assailant
been an unknown ruffian his death would have been followed by no
remorse the spectacle of his dying agonies would have dwelt upon the
memory of his assassin like any other mournful sight in the production
of which he bore no part

it must at least be said that his will was not concerned in this
transaction he acted in obedience to an impulse which he could not
control nor resist shall we impute guilt where there is no design
shall a man extract food for self-reproach from an action to which it is
not enough to say that he was actuated by no culpable intention but
that he was swayed by no intention whatever if consequences arise that
cannot be foreseen shall we find no refuge in the persuasion of our
rectitude and of human frailty shall we deem ourselves criminal because
we do not enjoy the attributes of deity because our power and our
knowledge are confined by impassable boundaries

but whence arose the subsequent intention it was the fruit of a
dreadful mistake his intents were noble and compassionate but this is
of no avail to free him from the imputation of guilt no remembrance of
past beneficence can compensate for this crime the scale loaded with
the recriminations of his conscience is immovable by any
counter-weight

but what are the conclusions to be drawn by dispassionate observers is
it possible to regard this person with disdain or with enmity the crime
originated in those limitations which nature has imposed upon human
faculties proofs of a just intention are all that are requisite to
exempt us from blame he is thus in consequence of a double mistake
the light in which he views this event is erroneous he judges wrong
and is therefore miserable

how imperfect are the grounds of all our decisions was it of no use to
superintend his childhood to select his instructors and examples to
mark the operations of his principles to see him emerging into youth
to follow him through various scenes and trying vicissitudes and mark
the uniformity of his integrity who would have predicted his future
conduct who would not have affirmed the impossibility of an action like
this

how mysterious was the connection between the fate of wiatte and his
sister by such circuitous and yet infallible means were the prediction
of the lady and the vengeance of the brother accomplished in how many
cases may it be said as in this that the prediction was the cause of
its own fulfilment that the very act which considerate observers and
even himself for a time imagined to have utterly precluded the
execution of wiatte's menaces should be that inevitably leading to it
that the execution should be assigned to him who abounding in
abhorrence and in the act of self-defence was the slayer of the
menacer

as the obstructer of his designs wiatte waylaid and assaulted clithero
he perished in the attempt were his designs frustrated no it was thus
that he secured the gratification of his vengeance his sister was cut
off in the bloom of life and prosperity by a refinement of good
fortune the voluntary minister of his malice had entailed upon himself
exile without reprieve and misery without end

but what chiefly excited my wonder was the connection of this tale with
the destiny of sarsefield this was he whom i have frequently mentioned
to you as my preceptor about four years previous to this era he
appeared in this district without fortune or friend he desired one
evening to be accommodated at my uncle's house the conversation
turning on the objects of his journey and his present situation he
professed himself in search of lucrative employment my uncle proposed
to him to become a teacher there being a sufficient number of young
people in this neighbourhood to afford him occupation and subsistence
he found it his interest to embrace this proposal

i of course became his pupil and demeaned myself in such a manner as
speedily to grow into a favourite he communicated to us no part of his
early history but informed us sufficiently of his adventures in asia
and italy to make it plain that this was the same person alluded to by
clithero during his abode among us his conduct was irreproachable when
he left us he manifested the most poignant regret but this originated
chiefly in his regard to me he promised to maintain with me an
epistolary intercourse since his departure however i had heard
nothing respecting him it was with unspeakable regret that i now heard
of the disappointment of his hopes and was inquisitive respecting the
measures which he would adopt in his new situation perhaps he would
once more return to america and i should again be admitted to the
enjoyment of his society this event i anticipated with the highest
satisfaction

at present the fate of the unhappy clithero was the subject of abundant
anxiety on his suddenly leaving me at the conclusion of his tale i
supposed that he had gone upon one of his usual rambles and that it
would terminate only with the day next morning a message was received
from inglefield inquiring if any one knew what had become of his
servant i could not listen to this message with tranquillity i
recollected the hints that he had given of some design upon his life
and admitted the most dreary forebodings i speeded to inglefield's
clithero had not returned they told me the preceding evening he had
not apprized them of any intention to change his abode his boxes and
all that composed his slender property were found in their ordinary
state he had expressed no dissatisfaction with his present condition

several days passed and no tidings could be procured of him his
absence was a topic of general speculation but was a source of
particular anxiety to no one but myself my apprehensions were surely
built upon sufficient grounds from the moment that we parted no one
had seen or heard of him what mode of suicide he had selected he had
disabled us from discovering by the impenetrable secrecy in which he
had involved it

in the midst of my reflections upon this subject the idea of the
wilderness occurred could he have executed his design in the deepest of
its recesses these were unvisited by human footsteps and his bones
might lie for ages in this solitude without attracting observation to
seek them where they lay to gather them together and provide for them a
grave was a duty which appeared incumbent on me and of which the
performance was connected with a thousand habitual sentiments and mixed
pleasures

thou knowest my devotion to the spirit that breathes its inspiration in
the gloom of forests and on the verge of streams i love to immerse
myself in shades and dells and hold converse with the solemnities and
secrecies of nature in the rude retreats of norwalk the disappearance
of clithero had furnished new incitements to ascend its cliffs and
pervade its thickets as i cherished the hope of meeting in my rambles
with some traces of this man but might he not still live his words had
imparted the belief that he intended to destroy himself this
catastrophe however was far from certain was it not in my power to
avert it could i not restore a mind thus vigorous to tranquil and
wholesome existence could i not subdue his perverse disdain and
immeasurable abhorrence of himself his upbraiding and his scorn were
unmerited and misplaced perhaps they argued frenzy rather than
prejudice but frenzy like prejudice was curable reason was no less
an antidote to the illusions of insanity like his than to the illusions
of error

i did not immediately recollect that to subsist in this desert was
impossible nuts were the only fruits it produced and these were
inadequate to sustain human life if it were haunted by clithero he
must occasionally pass its limits and beg or purloin victuals this
deportment was too humiliating and flagitious to be imputed to him
there was reason to suppose him smitten with the charms of solitude of
a lonely abode in the midst of mountainous and rugged nature but this
could not be uninterruptedly enjoyed life could be supported only by
occasionally visiting the haunts of men in the guise of a thief or a
mendicant hence since clithero was not known to have reappeared at any
farm-house in the neighbourhood i was compelled to conclude either that
he had retired far from this district or that he was dead

though i designed that my leisure should chiefly be consumed in the
bosom of norwalk i almost dismissed the hope of meeting with the
fugitive there were indeed two sources of my hopelessness on this
occasion not only it was probable that clithero had fled far away but
should he have concealed himself in some nook or cavern within these
precincts his concealment was not to be traced this arose from the
nature of that sterile region

it would not be easy to describe the face of this district in a few
words half of solesbury thou knowest admits neither of plough nor
spade the cultivable space lies along the river and the desert lying
on the north has gained by some means the appellation of norwalk
canst thou imagine a space somewhat circular about six miles in
diameter and exhibiting a perpetual and intricate variety of craggy
eminences and deep dells

the hollows are single and walled around by cliffs ever varying in
shape and height and have seldom any perceptible communication with
each other these hollows are of all dimensions from the narrowness and
depth of a well to the amplitude of one hundred yards winter's snow is
frequently found in these cavities at midsummer the streams that burst
forth from every crevice are thrown by the irregularities of the
surface into numberless cascades often disappear in mists or in
chasms and emerge from subterranean channels and finally either
subside into lakes or quietly meander through the lower and more level
grounds

wherever nature left a flat it is made rugged and scarcely passable by
enormous and fallen trunks accumulated by the storms of ages and
forming by their slow decay a moss-covered soil the haunt of rabbits
and lizards these spots are obscured by the melancholy umbrage of
pines whose eternal murmurs are in unison with vacancy and solitude
with the reverberations of the torrents and the whistling of the blasts
hickory and poplar which abound in the lowlands find here no fostering
elements

a sort of continued vale winding and abrupt leads into the midst of
this region and through it this vale serves the purpose of a road it
is a tedious maze and perpetual declivity and requires from the
passenger a cautious and sure foot openings and ascents occasionally
present themselves on each side which seem to promise you access to the
interior region but always terminate sooner or later in insuperable
difficulties at the verge of a precipice or the bottom of a steep

perhaps no one was more acquainted with this wilderness than i but my
knowledge was extremely imperfect i had traversed parts of it at an
early age in pursuit of berries and nuts or led by a roaming
disposition afterwards the sphere of my rambles was enlarged and their
purpose changed when sarsefield came among us i became his favourite
scholar and the companion of all his pedestrian excursions he was fond
of penetrating into these recesses partly from the love of picturesque
scenes partly to investigate its botanical and mineral productions and
partly to carry on more effectually that species of instruction which he
had adopted with regard to me and which chiefly consisted in moralizing
narratives or synthetical reasonings these excursions had familiarized
me with its outlines and most accessible parts but there was much
which perhaps could never be reached without wings and much the only
paths to which i might forever overlook

every new excursion indeed added somewhat to my knowledge new tracks
were pursued new prospects detected and new summits were gained my
rambles were productive of incessant novelty though they always
terminated in the prospect of limits that could not be overleaped but
none of these had led me wider from my customary paths than that which
had taken place when in pursuit of clithero i had a faint remembrance
of the valley into which i had descended after him but till then i had
viewed it at a distance and supposed it impossible to reach the bottom
but by leaping from a precipice some hundred feet in height the
opposite steep seemed no less inaccessible and the cavern at the bottom
was impervious to any views which my former positions had enabled me to
take of it

my intention to re-examine this cave and ascertain whither it led had
for a time been suspended by different considerations it was now
revived with more energy than ever i reflected that this had formerly
been haunted by clithero and might possibly have been the scene of the
desperate act which he had meditated it might at least conceal some
token of his past existence it might lead into spaces hitherto
unvisited and to summits from which wider landscapes might be seen

one morning i set out to explore this scene the road which clithero had
taken was laboriously circuitous on my return from the first pursuit of
him i ascended the cliff in my former footsteps but soon lighted on
the beaten track which i have already described this enabled me to shun
a thousand obstacles which had lately risen before me and opened an
easy passage to the cavern

i once more traversed this way the brow of the hill was gained the
ledges of which it consisted afforded sufficient footing when the
attempt was made though viewed at a distance they seemed to be too
narrow for that purpose as i descended the rugged stair i could not
but wonder at the temerity and precipitation with which this descent had
formerly been made it seemed as if the noonday light and the tardiest
circumspection would scarcely enable me to accomplish it yet then it
had been done with headlong speed and with no guidance but the moon's
uncertain rays

i reached the mouth of the cave till now i had forgotten that a lamp or
a torch might be necessary to direct my subterranean footsteps i was
unwilling to defer the attempt light might possibly be requisite if
the cave had no other outlet somewhat might present itself within to
the eyes which might forever elude the hands but i was more inclined
to consider it merely as an avenue terminating in an opening on the
summit of the steep or on the opposite side of the ridge caution might
supply the place of light or having explored the cave as far as
possible at present i might hereafter return better furnished for the
scrutiny




chapter x


with these determinations i proceeded the entrance was low and
compelled me to resort to hands as well as feet at a few yards from the
mouth the light disappeared and i found myself immersed in the dunnest
obscurity had i not been persuaded that another had gone before me i
should have relinquished the attempt i proceeded with the utmost
caution always ascertaining by outstretched arms the height and
breadth of the cavity before me in a short time the dimensions expanded
on all sides and permitted me to resume my feet

i walked upon a smooth and gentle declivity presently the wall on one
side and the ceiling receded beyond my reach i began to fear that i
should be involved in a maze and should be disabled from returning to
obviate this danger it was requisite to adhere to the nearest wall and
conform to the direction which it should take without straying through
the palpable obscurity whether the ceiling was lofty or low whether
the opposite wall of the passage was distant or near this i deemed no
proper opportunity to investigate

in a short time my progress was stopped by an abrupt descent i set
down the advancing foot with caution being aware that i might at the
next step encounter a bottomless pit to the brink of such a one i
seemed now to have arrived i stooped and stretched my hand forward and
downward but all was vacuity

here it was needful to pause i had reached the brink of a cavity whose
depth it avas impossible to ascertain it might be a few inches beyond
my reach or hundreds of feet by leaping down i might incur no injury
or might plunge into a lake or dash myself to pieces on the points of
rocks

i now saw with new force the propriety of being furnished with a light
the first suggestion was to return upon my footsteps and resume my
undertaking on the morrow yet having advanced thus far i felt
reluctance to recede without accomplishing my purposes i reflected
likewise that clithero had boldly entered this recess and had certainly
come forth at a different avenue from that at which he entered

at length it occurred to me that though i could not go forward yet i
might proceed along the edge of this cavity this edge would be as safe
a guidance and would serve as well for a clue by which i might return
as the wall which it was now necessary to forsake

intense dark is always the parent of fears impending injuries cannot in
this state be descried nor shunned nor repelled i began to feel some
faltering of my courage and seated myself for a few minutes on a
stony mass which arose before me my situation was new the caverns i
had hitherto met with in this desert were chiefly formed of low-browed
rocks they were chambers more or less spacious into which twilight
was at least admitted but here it seemed as if i were surrounded by
barriers that would forever cut off my return to air and to light

presently i resumed my courage and proceeded my road appeared now to
ascend on one side i seemed still upon the verge of a precipice and on
the other all was empty and waste i had gone no inconsiderable
distance and persuaded myself that my career would speedily terminate
in a short time the space on the left hand was again occupied and i
cautiously proceeded between the edge of the gulf and a rugged wall as
the space between them widened i adhered to the wall

i was not insensible that my path became more intricate and more
difficult to retread in proportion as i advanced i endeavoured to
preserve a vivid conception of the way which i had already passed and
to keep the images of the left and right-hand wall and the gulf in due
succession in my memory

the path which had hitherto been considerably smooth now became rugged
and steep chilling damps the secret trepidation which attended me the
length and difficulties of my way enhanced by the ceaseless caution and
the numerous expedients which the utter darkness obliged me to employ
began to overpower my strength i was frequently compelled to stop and
recruit myself by rest these respites from toil were of use but they
could not enable me to prosecute an endless journey and to return was
scarcely a less arduous task than to proceed

i looked anxiously forward in the hope of being comforted by some dim
ray which might assure me that my labours were approaching an end at
last this propitious token appeared and i issued forth into a kind of
chamber one side of which was open to the air and allowed me to catch a
portion of the checkered sky this spectacle never before excited such
exquisite sensations in my bosom the air likewise breathed into the
cavern was unspeakably delicious

i now found myself on the projecture of a rock above and below the
hill-side was nearly perpendicular opposite and at the distance of
fifteen or twenty yards was a similar ascent at the bottom was a glen
cold narrow and obscure this projecture which served as a kind of
vestibule to the cave was connected with a ledge by which though not
without peril and toil i was conducted to the summit

this summit was higher than any of those which were interposed between
itself and the river a large part of this chaos of rocks and precipices
was subjected at one view to the eye the fertile lawns and vales
which lay beyond this the winding course of the river and the slopes
which rose on its farther side were parts of this extensive scene
these objects were at any time fitted to inspire rapture now my delight
was enhanced by the contrast which this lightsome and serene element
bore to the glooms from which i had lately emerged my station also
was higher and the limits of my view consequently more ample than any
which i had hitherto enjoyed

i advanced to the outer verge of the hill which i found to overlook a
steep no less inaccessible and a glen equally profound i changed
frequently my station in order to diversify the scenery at length it
became necessary to inquire by what means i should return i traversed
the edge of the hill but on every side it was equally steep and always
too lofty to permit me to leap from it as i kept along the verge i
perceived that it tended in a circular direction and brought me back
at last to the spot from which i had set out from this inspection it
seemed as if return was impossible by any other way than that through
the cavern

i now turned my attention to the interior space if you imagine a
cylindrical mass with a cavity dug in the centre whose edge conforms
to the exterior edge and if you place in this cavity another cylinder
higher than that which surrounds it but so small as to leave between
its sides and those of the cavity a hollow space you will gain as
distinct an image of this hill as words can convey the summit of the
inner rock was rugged and covered with trees of unequal growth to reach
this summit would not render my return easier but its greater elevation
would extend my view and perhaps furnish a spot from which the whole
horizon was conspicuous

as i had traversed the outer i now explored the inner edge of this
hill at length i reached a spot where the chasm separating the two
rocks was narrower than at any other part at first view it seemed as
if it were possible to leap over it but a nearer examination showed me
that the passage was impracticable so far as my eye could estimate it
the breadth was thirty or forty feet i could scarcely venture to look
beneath the height was dizzy and the walls which approached each
other at top receded at the bottom so as to form the resemblance of an
immense hall lighted from a rift which some convulsion of nature had
made in the roof where i stood there ascended a perpetual mist
occasioned by a torrent that dashed along the rugged pavement below

from these objects i willingly turned my eye upon those before and above
me on the opposite ascent a stream rushing from above fell into a
cavity which its own force seemed gradually to have made the noise and
the motion equally attracted my attention there was a desolate and
solitary grandeur in the scene enhanced by the circumstances in which
it was beheld and by the perils through which i had recently passed
that had never before been witnessed by me

a sort of sanctity and awe environed it owing to the consciousness of
absolute and utter loneliness it was probable that human feet had never
before gained this recess that human eyes had never been fixed upon
these gushing waters the aboriginal inhabitants had no motives to lead
them into caves like this and ponder on the verge of such a precipice
their successors were still less likely to have wandered hither since
the birth of this continent i was probably the first who had deviated
thus remotely from the customary paths of men

while musing upon these ideas my eye was fixed upon the foaming
current at length i looked upon the rocks which confined and
embarrassed its course i admired their fantastic shapes and endless
irregularities passing from one to the other of these my attention
lighted at length as if by some magical transition on a human
countenance

my surprise was so abrupt and my sensations so tumultuous that i
forgot for a moment the perilous nature of my situation i loosened my
hold of a pine-branch which had been hitherto one of my supports and
almost started from my seat had my station been in a slight degree
nearer the brink than it was i should have fallen headlong into the
abyss

to meet a human creature even on that side of the chasm which i
occupied would have been wholly adverse to my expectation my station
was accessible by no other road than that through which i had passed
and no motives were imaginable by which others could be prompted to
explore this road but he whom i now beheld was seated where it seemed
impossible for human efforts to have placed him

but this affected me but little in comparison with other incidents not
only the countenance was human but in spite of shaggy and tangled
locks and an air of melancholy wildness i speedily recognised the
features of the fugitive clithero

one glance was not sufficient to make me acquainted with this scene i
had come hither partly in pursuit of this man but some casual appendage
of his person something which should indicate his past rather than his
present existence was all that i hoped to find that he should be found
alive in this desert that he should have gained this summit access to
which was apparently impossible were scarcely within the boundaries of
belief

his scanty and coarse garb had been nearly rent away by brambles and
thorns his arms bosom and cheeks were overgrown and half concealed by
hair there was somewhat in his attitude and looks denoting more than
anarchy of thoughts and passions his rueful ghastly and immovable
eyes testified not only that his mind was ravaged by despair but that
he was pinched with famine

these proofs of his misery thrilled to my inmost heart horror and
shuddering invaded me as i stood gazing upon him and for a time i was
without the power of deliberating on the measures which it was my duty
to adopt for his relief the first suggestion was by calling to inform
him of my presence i knew not what counsel or comfort to offer by what
words to bespeak his attention or by what topics to mollify his direful
passions i knew not though so near the gulf by which we were
separated was impassable all that i could do was to speak

my surprise and my horror were still strong enough to give a shrill and
piercing tone to my voice the chasm and the rocks loudened and
reverberated my accents while i exclaimed man clithero

my summons was effectual he shook off his trance in a moment he had
been stretched upon his back with his eyes fixed upon a craggy
projecture above as if he were in momentary expectation of its fall and
crushing him to atoms now he started on his feet he was conscious of
the voice but not of the quarter whence it came he was looking
anxiously around when i again spoke look hither it is i who called

he looked astonishment was now mingled with every other dreadful
meaning in his visage he clasped his hands together and bent forward
as if to satisfy himself that his summoner was real at the next moment
he drew back placed his hands upon his breast and fixed his eyes on
the ground

this pause was not likely to be broken but by me i was preparing again
to speak to be more distinctly heard i advanced closer to the brink
during this action my eye was necessarily withdrawn from him having
gained a somewhat nearer station i looked again but he was gone

the seat which he so lately occupied was empty i was not forewarned of
his disappearance or directed to the course of his flight by any
rustling among leaves these indeed would have been overpowered by the
noise of the cataract the place where he sat was the bottom of a
cavity one side of which terminated in the verge of the abyss but the
other sides were perpendicular or overhanging surely he had not leaped
into this gulf and yet that he had so speedily scaled the steep was
impossible

i looked into the gulf but the depth and the gloom allowed me to see
nothing with distinctness his cries or groans could not be overheard
amidst the uproar of the waters his fall must have instantly destroyed
him and that he had fallen was the only conclusion i could draw

my sensations on this incident cannot be easily described the image of
this man's despair and of the sudden catastrophe to which my
inauspicious interference had led filled me with compunction and
terror some of my fears were relieved by the new conjecture that
behind the rock on which he had lain there might be some aperture or
pit into which he had descended or in which he might be concealed

i derived consolation from this conjecture not only the evil which i
dreaded might not have happened but some alleviation of his misery was
possible could i arrest his footsteps and win his attention i might be
able to insinuate the lessons of fortitude but if words were impotent
and arguments were nugatory yet to sit by him in silence to moisten
his hand with tears to sigh in unison to offer him the spectacle of
sympathy the solace of believing that his demerits were not estimated
by so rigid a standard by others as by himself that one at least among
his fellow-men regarded him with love and pity could not fail to be of
benign influence

these thoughts inspired me with new zeal to effect my purpose it was
requisite to reach the opposite steep i was now convinced that this was
not an impracticable undertaking since clithero had already performed
it i once more made the circuit of the hill every side was steep and
of enormous height and the gulf was nowhere so narrow as at this spot
i therefore returned hither and once more pondered on the means of
passing this tremendous chasm in safety

casting my eyes upward i noted the tree at the root of which i was
standing i compared the breadth of the gulf with the length of the
trunk of this tree and it appeared very suitable for a bridge happily
it grew obliquely and if felled by an axe would probably fall of
itself in such a manner as to be suspended across the chasm the stock
was thick enough to afford me footing and would enable me to reach the
opposite declivity without danger or delay

a more careful examination of the spot the site of the tree its
dimensions and the direction of its growth convinced me fully of the
practicability of this expedient and i determined to carry it into
immediate execution for this end i must hasten home procure an axe
and return with all expedition hither i took my former way once more
entered the subterranean avenue and slowly re-emerged into day before
i reached home the evening was at hand and my tired limbs and jaded
spirits obliged me to defer my undertaking till the morrow

though my limbs were at rest my thoughts were active through the night
i carefully reviewed the situation of this hill and was unable to
conjecture by what means clithero could place himself upon it unless he
occasionally returned to the habitable grounds it was impossible for
him to escape perishing by famine he might intend to destroy himself by
this means and my first efforts were to be employed to overcome this
fatal resolution to persuade him to leave his desolate haunts might be
a laborious and tedious task meanwhile all my benevolent intentions
would be frustrated by his want of sustenance it was proper therefore
to carry bread with me and to place it before him the sight of food
the urgencies of hunger and my vehement entreaties might prevail on
him to eat though no expostulations might suffice to make him seek food
at a distance




chapter xi


next morning i stored a small bag with meat and bread and throwing an
axe on my shoulder set out without informing any one of my intentions
for the hill my passage was rendered more difficult by these
encumbrances but my perseverance surmounted every impediment and i
gained in a few hours the foot of the tree whose trunk was to serve me
for a bridge in this journey i saw no traces of the fugitive

a new survey of the tree confirmed my former conclusions and i began my
work with diligence my strokes were repeated by a thousand echoes and
i paused at first somewhat startled by reverberations which made it
appear as if not one but a score of axes were employed at the same time
on both sides of the gulf

quickly the tree fell and exactly in the manner which i expected arid
desired the wide-spread limbs occupied and choked up the channel of the
torrent and compelled it to seek a new outlet and multiplied its
murmurs i dared not trust myself to cross it in an upright posture but
clung with hands and feet to its rugged bark having reached the
opposite cliff i proceeded to examine the spot where clithero had
disappeared my fondest hopes were realized for a considerable cavity
appeared which on a former day had been concealed from my distant
view by the rock

it was obvious to conclude that this was his present habitation or that
an avenue conducting hither and terminating in the unexplored sides of
this pit was that by which he had come hither and by which he had
retired i could not hesitate long to slide into the pit i found an
entrance through which i fearlessly penetrated i was prepared to
encounter obstacles and perils similar to those which i have already
described but was rescued from them by ascending in a few minutes
into a kind of passage open above but walled by a continued rock on
both sides the sides of this passage conformed with the utmost
exactness to each other nature at some former period had occasioned
the solid mass to dispart at this place and had thus afforded access to
the summit of the hill loose stones and ragged points formed the
flooring of this passage which rapidly and circuitously ascended

i was now within a few yards of the surface of the rock the passage
opened into a kind of chamber or pit the sides of which were not
difficult to climb i rejoiced at the prospect of this termination of my
journey here i paused and throwing my weary limbs on the ground
began to examine the objects around me and to meditate on the steps
that were next to be taken

my first glance lighted on the very being of whom i was in search
stretched upon a bed of moss at the distance of a few feet from my
station i beheld clithero he had not been roused by my approach
though my footsteps were perpetually stumbling and sliding this
reflection gave birth to the fear that he was dead a nearer inspection
dispelled my apprehensions and showed me that he was merely buried in
profound slumber those vigils must indeed have been long which were at
last succeeded by a sleep so oblivious

this meeting was in the highest degree propitious it not only assured
me of his existence but proved that his miseries were capable of being
suspended his slumber enabled me to pause to ruminate on the manner by
which his understanding might be most successfully addressed to collect
and arrange the topics fitted to rectify his gloomy and disastrous
perceptions

thou knowest that i am qualified for such tasks neither by my education
nor my genius the headlong and ferocious energies of this man could not
be repelled or diverted into better paths by efforts so undisciplined as
mine a despair so stormy and impetuous would drown my feeble accents
how should i attempt to reason with him how should i outroot
prepossessions so inveterate the fruits of his earliest education
fostered and matured by the observation and experience of his whole
life how should i convince him that since the death of wiatte was not
intended the deed was without crime that if it had been deliberately
concerted it was still a virtue since his own life could by no other
means be preserved that when he pointed a dagger at the bosom of his
mistress he was actuated not by avarice or ambition or revenge or
malice he desired to confer on her the highest and the only benefit of
which he believed her capable he sought to rescue her from tormenting
regrets and lingering agonies

these positions were sufficiently just to my own view but i was not
called upon to reduce them to practice i had not to struggle with the
consciousness of having been rescued by some miraculous contingency
from imbruing my hands in the blood of her whom i adored of having
drawn upon myself suspicions of ingratitude and murder too deep to be
ever effaced of having bereft myself of love and honour and friends
and spotless reputation of having doomed myself to infamy and
detestation to hopeless exile penury and servile toil these were the
evils which his malignant destiny had made the unalterable portion of
clithero and how should my imperfect eloquence annihilate these evils
every man not himself the victim of irretrievable disasters perceives
the folly of ruminating on the past and of fostering a grief which
cannot reverse or recall the decrees of an immutable necessity but
every man who suffers is unavoidably shackled by the errors which he
censures in his neighbour and his efforts to relieve himself are as
fruitless as those with which he attempted the relief of others

no topic therefore could be properly employed by me on the present
occasion all that i could do was to offer him food and by pathetic
supplications to prevail on him to eat famine however obstinate
would scarcely refrain when bread was placed within sight and reach
when made to swerve from his resolution in one instance it would be
less difficult to conquer it a second time the magic of sympathy the
perseverance of benevolence though silent might work a gradual and
secret revolution and better thoughts might insensibly displace those
desperate suggestions which now governed him

having revolved these ideas i placed the food which i had brought at
his right hand and seating myself at his feet attentively surveyed
his countenance the emotions which were visible during wakefulness had
vanished during this cessation of remembrance and remorse or were
faintly discernible they served to dignify and solemnize his features
and to embellish those immutable lines which betokened the spirit of his
better days lineaments were now observed which could never coexist with
folly or associate with obdurate guilt

i had no inclination to awaken him this respite was too sweet to be
needlessly abridged i determined to await the operation of nature and
to prolong by silence and by keeping interruption at a distance this
salutary period of forgetfulness this interval permitted new ideas to
succeed in my mind

clithero believed his solitude to be unapproachable what new expedients
to escape inquiry and intrusion might not my presence suggest might he
not vanish as he had done on the former day and afford me no time to
assail his constancy and tempt his hunger if however i withdrew
during his sleep he would awake without disturbance and be
unconscious for a time that his secrecy had been violated he would
quickly perceive the victuals and would need no foreign inducements to
eat a provision so unexpected and extraordinary might suggest new
thoughts and be construed into a kind of heavenly condemnation of his
purpose he would not readily suspect the motives or person of his
visitant would take no precaution against the repetition of my visit
and at the same time our interview would not be attended with so much
surprise the more i revolved these reflections the greater force they
acquired at length i determined to withdraw and leaving the food
where it could scarcely fail of attracting his notice i returned by the
way that i had come i had scarcely reached home when a messenger from
inglefield arrived requesting me to spend the succeeding night at his
house as some engagement had occurred to draw him to the city

i readily complied with this request it was not necessary however to
be early in my visit i deferred going till the evening was far
advanced my way led under the branches of the elm which recent events
had rendered so memorable hence my reflections reverted to the
circumstances which had lately occurred in connection with this tree

i paused for some time under its shade i marked the spot where
clithero had been discovered digging it showed marks of being
unsettled but the sod which had formerly covered it and which had
lately been removed was now carefully replaced this had not been done
by him on that occasion in which i was a witness of his behaviour the
earth was then hastily removed and as hastily thrown again into the
hole from which it had been taken

some curiosity was naturally excited by this appearance either some
other person or clithero on a subsequent occasion had been here i
was now likewise led to reflect on the possible motives that prompted
the maniac to turn up this earth there is always some significance in
the actions of a sleeper somewhat was perhaps buried in this spot
connected with the history of mrs lorimer or of clarice was it not
possible to ascertain the truth in this respect

there was but one method by carefully uncovering this hole and digging
as deep as clithero had already dug it would quickly appear whether any
thing was hidden to do this publicly by daylight was evidently
indiscreet besides a moment's delay was superfluous the night had now
fallen and before it was past this new undertaking might be finished
an interview was if possible to be gained with clithero on the morrow
and for this interview the discoveries made on this spot might eminently
qualify me influenced by these considerations i resolved to dig i was
first however to converse an hour with the housekeeper and then to
withdraw to my chamber when the family were all retired and there was
no fear of observation or interruption i proposed to rise and hasten
with a proper implement hither

one chamber in inglefield's house was usually reserved for visitants in
this chamber thy unfortunate brother died and here it was that i was to
sleep the image of its last inhabitant could not fail of being called
up and of banishing repose but the scheme which i had meditated was an
additional incitement to watchfulness hither i repaired at the due
season having previously furnished myself with candles since i knew
not what might occur to make a light necessary

i did not go to bed but either sat musing by a table or walked across
the room the bed before me was that on which my friend breathed his
last to rest my head upon the same pillow to lie on that pallet which
sustained his cold and motionless limbs were provocations to
remembrance and grief that i desired to shun i endeavoured to fill my
mind with more recent incidents with the disasters of clithero my
subterranean adventures and the probable issue of the schemes which i
now contemplated

i recalled the conversation which had just ended with the housekeeper
clithero had been our theme but she had dealt chiefly in repetitions of
what had formerly been related by her or by inglefield i inquired what
this man had left behind and found that it consisted of a square box
put together by himself with uncommon strength but of rugged
workmanship she proceeded to mention that she had advised her brother
mr inglefield to break open this box and ascertain its contents but
this he did not think himself justified in doing clithero was guilty of
no known crime was responsible to no one for his actions and might
some time return to claim his property this box contained nothing with
which others had a right to meddle somewhat might be found in it
throwing light upon his past or present situation but curiosity was not
to be gratified by these means what clithero thought proper to conceal
it was criminal for us to extort from him

the housekeeper was by no means convinced by these arguments and at
length obtained her brother's permission to try whether any of her own
keys would unlock this chest the keys were produced but no lock nor
keyhole were discoverable the lid was fast but by what means it was
fastened the most accurate inspection could not detect hence she was
compelled to lay aside her project this chest had always stood in the
chamber which i now occupied

these incidents were now remembered and i felt disposed to profit by
this opportunity of examining this box it stood in a corner and was
easily distinguished by its form i lifted it and found its weight by no
means extraordinary its structure was remarkable it consisted of six
sides square and of similar dimensions these were joined not by
mortise and tennon not by nails not by hinges but the junction was
accurate the means by which they were made to cohere were invisible

appearances on every side were uniform nor were there any marks by
which the lid was distinguishable from its other surfaces

during his residence with inglefield many specimens of mechanical
ingenuity were given by his servant this was the workmanship of his own
hands i looked at it for some time till the desire insensibly arose of
opening it and examining its contents

i had no more right to do this than the inglefields perhaps indeed
this curiosity was more absurd and the gratification more culpable in
me than in them i was acquainted with the history of clithero's past
life and with his present condition respecting these i had no new
intelligence to gain and no doubts to solve what excuse could i make
to the proprietor should he ever reappear to claim his own or to
inglefield for breaking open a receptacle which all the maxims of
society combine to render sacred

but could not my end be gained without violence the means of opening
might present themselves on a patient scrutiny the lid might be raised
and shut down again without any tokens of my act its contents might be
examined and all things restored to their former condition in a few
minutes

i intended not a theft i intended to benefit myself without inflicting
injury on others nay might not the discoveries i should make throw
light upon the conduct of this extraordinary man which his own narrative
had withheld was there reason to confide implicitly on the tale which i
had heard

in spite of the testimony of my own feelings the miseries of clithero
appeared in some degree fantastic and groundless a thousand conceivable
motives might induce him to pervert or conceal the truth if he were
thoroughly known his character might assume a new appearance and what
is now so difficult to reconcile to common maxims might prove perfectly
consistent with them i desire to restore him to peace but a thorough
knowledge of his actions is necessary both to show that he is worthy of
compassion and to suggest the best means of extirpating his errors it
was possible that this box contained the means of this knowledge

there were likewise other motives which as they possessed some
influence however small deserve to be mentioned thou knowest that i
also am a mechanist i had constructed a writing-desk and cabinet in
which i had endeavoured to combine the properties of secrecy security
and strength in the highest possible degree i looked upon this
therefore with the eye of an artist and was solicitous to know the
principles on which it was formed i determined to examine and if
possible to open it




chapter xii


i surveyed it with the utmost attention all its parts appeared equally
solid and smooth it could not be doubted that one of its sides served
the purpose of a lid and was possible to be raised mere strength could
not be applied to raise it because there was no projecture which might
be firmly held by the hand and by which force could be exerted some
spring therefore secretly existed which might forever elude the
senses but on which the hand by being moved over it in all directions
might accidentally light

this process was effectual a touch casually applied at an angle drove
back a bolt and a spring at the same time was set in action by which
the lid was raised above half an inch no event could be supposed more
fortuitous than this a hundred hands might have sought in vain for this
spring the spot in which a certain degree of pressure was sufficient to
produce this effect was of all the least likely to attract notice or
awaken suspicion

i opened the trunk with eagerness the space within was divided into
numerous compartments none of which contained any thing of moment
tools of different and curious constructions and remnants of minute
machinery were all that offered themselves to my notice

my expectations being thus frustrated i proceeded to restore things to
their former state i attempted to close the lid but the spring which
had raised it refused to bend no measure that i could adopt enabled me
to place the lid in the same situation in which i had found it in my
efforts to press down the lid which were augmented in proportion to the
resistance that i met with the spring was broken this obstacle being
removed the lid resumed its proper place but no means within the
reach of my ingenuity to discover enabled me to push forward the bolt
and thus to restore the fastening

i now perceived that clithero had provided not only against the opening
of his cabinet but likewise against the possibility of concealing that
it had been opened this discovery threw me into some confusion i had
been tempted thus far by the belief that my action was without
witnesses and might be forever concealed this opinion was now
confuted if clithero should ever reclaim his property he would not
fail to detect the violence of which i had been guilty inglefield would
disapprove in another what he had not permitted to himself and the
unauthorized and clandestine manner in which i had behaved would
aggravate in his eyes the heinousness of my offence

but now there was no remedy all that remained was to hinder suspicion
from lighting on the innocent and to confess to my friend the offence
which i had committed meanwhile my first project was resumed and the
family being now wrapped in profound sleep i left my chamber and
proceeded to the elm the moon was extremely brilliant but i hoped that
this unfrequented road and unseasonable hour would hinder me from being
observed my chamber was above the kitchen with which it communicated
by a small staircase and the building to which it belonged was
connected with the dwelling by a gallery i extinguished the light and
left it in the kitchen intending to relight it by the embers that
still glowed on the hearth on my return

i began to remove the sod and cast out the earth with little confidence
in the success of my project the issue of my examination of the box
humbled and disheartened me for some time i found nothing that tended
to invigorate my hopes i determined however to descend as long as
the unsettled condition of the earth showed me that some one had
preceded me small masses of stone were occasionally met with which
served only to perplex me with groundless expectations at length my
spade struck upon something which emitted a very different sound i
quickly drew it forth and found it to be wood its regular form and
the crevices which were faintly discernible persuaded me that it was
human workmanship and that there was a cavity within the place in
which it was found easily suggested some connection between this and the
destiny of clithero covering up the hole with speed i hastened with my
prize to the house the door by which the kitchen was entered was not to
be seen from the road it opened on a field the farther limit of which
was a ledge of rocks which formed on this side the boundary of
inglefield's estate and the westernmost barrier of norwalk

as i turned the angle of the house and came in view of this door
methought i saw a figure issue from it i was startled at this incident
and stopping crouched close to the wall that i might not be
discovered as soon as the figure passed beyond the verge of the shade
it was easily distinguished to be that of clithero he crossed the field
with a rapid pace and quickly passed beyond the reach of my eye

this appearance was mysterious for what end he should visit this
habitation could not be guessed was the contingency to be lamented in
consequence of which an interview had been avoided would it have
compelled me to explain the broken condition of his trunk i knew not
whether to rejoice at having avoided this interview or to deplore it

these thoughts did not divert me from examining the nature of the prize
which i had gained i relighted my candle and hied once more to the
chamber the first object which on entering it attracted my attention
was the cabinet broken into twenty fragments on the hearth i had left
it on a low table at a distant corner of the room

no conclusion could be formed but that clithero had been here had
discovered the violence which had been committed on his property and
in the first transport of his indignation had shattered it to pieces i
shuddered on reflecting how near i had been to being detected by him in
the very act and by how small an interval i had escaped that resentment
which in that case would have probably been wreaked upon me

my attention was withdrawn at length from this object and fixed upon
the contents of the box which i had dug up this was equally
inaccessible with the other i had not the same motives for caution and
forbearance i was somewhat desperate as the consequences of my
indiscretion could not be aggravated and my curiosity was more
impetuous with regard to the smaller than to the larger cabinet i
placed it on the ground and crushed it to pieces with my heel

something was within i brought it to the light and after loosing
numerous folds at length drew forth a volume no object in the circle
of nature was more adapted than this to rouse up all my faculties my
feelings were anew excited on observing that it was a manuscript i
bolted the door and drawing near the light opened and began to read

a few pages were sufficient to explain the nature of the work clithero
had mentioned that his lady had composed a vindication of her conduct
towards her brother when her intercession in his favour was solicited
and refused this performance had never been published but had been
read by many and was preserved by her friends as a precious monument of
her genius and her virtue this manuscript was now before me

that clithero should preserve this manuscript amidst the wreck of his
hopes and fortunes was apparently conformable to his temper that
having formed the resolution to die he should seek to hide this volume
from the profane curiosity of survivors was a natural proceeding to
bury it rather than to burn or disperse it into fragments would be
suggested by the wish to conceal without committing what his heated
fancy would regard as sacrilege to bury it beneath the elm was dictated
by no fortuitous or inexplicable caprice this event could scarcely fail
of exercising some influence on the perturbations of his sleep and
thus in addition to other causes might his hovering near this trunk
and throwing up this earth in the intervals of slumber be accounted
for clithero indeed had not mentioned this proceeding in the course
of his narrative but that would have contravened the end for which he
had provided a grave for this book

i read this copious tale with unspeakable eagerness it essentially
agreed with that which had been told by clithero by drawing forth
events into all their circumstances more distinct impressions were
produced on the mind and proofs of fortitude and equanimity were here
given to which i had hitherto known no parallel no wonder that a soul
like clithero's pervaded by these proofs of inimitable excellence and
thrillingly alive to the passion of virtuous fame and the value of that
existence which he had destroyed should be overborne by horror at the
view of the past

the instability of life and happiness was forcibly illustrated as well
as the perniciousness of error exempt as this lady was from almost
every defect she was indebted for her ruin to absurd opinions of the
sacredness of consanguinity to her anxiety for the preservation of a
ruffian because that ruffian was her brother the spirit of clithero was
enlightened and erect but he weakly suffered the dictates of eternal
justice to be swallowed up by gratitude the dread of unjust upbraiding
hurried him to murder and to suicide and the imputation of imaginary
guilt impelled him to the perpetration of genuine and enormous crimes

the perusal of this volume ended not but with the night contrary to my
hopes the next day was stormy and wet this did not deter me from
visiting the mountain slippery paths and muddy torrents were no
obstacles to the purposes which i had adopted i wrapped myself and a
bag of provisions in a cloak of painted canvas and speeded to the
dwelling of clithero

i passed through the cave and reached the bridge which my own ingenuity
had formed at that moment torrents of rain poured from above and
stronger blasts thundered amidst these desolate recesses and profound
chasms instead of lamenting the prevalence of this tempest i now began
to regard it with pleasure it conferred new forms of sublimity and
grandeur on this scene

as i crept with hands and feet along my imperfect bridge a sudden gust
had nearly whirled me into the frightful abyss below to preserve
myself i was obliged to loose my hold of my burden and it fell into
the gulf this incident disconcerted and distressed me as soon as i had
effected my dangerous passage i screened myself behind a cliff and gave
myself up to reflection

the purpose of this arduous journey was defeated by the loss of the
provisions i had brought i despaired of winning the attention of the
fugitive to supplications or arguments tending to smother remorse or
revive his fortitude the scope of my efforts was to consist in
vanquishing his aversion to food but these efforts would now be
useless since i had no power to supply his cravings

this deficiency however was easily supplied i had only to return home
and supply myself anew no time was to be lost in doing this but i was
willing to remain under this shelter till the fury of the tempest had
subsided besides i was not certain that clithero had again retreated
hither it was requisite to explore the summit of this hill and
ascertain whether it had any inhabitant i might likewise discover what
had been the success of my former experiment and whether the food
which had been left here on the former day was consumed or neglected

while occupied with these reflections my eyes were fixed upon the
opposite steeps the tops of the trees waving to and fro in the wildest
commotion and their trunks occasionally bending to the blast which
in these lofty regions blew with a violence unknown in the tracts
below exhibited an awful spectacle at length my attention was
attracted by the trunk which lay across the gulf and which i had
converted into a bridge i perceived that it had already somewhat
swerved from its original position that every blast broke or loosened
some of the fibres by which its roots were connected with the opposite
bank and that if the storm did not speedily abate there was imminent
danger of its being torn from the rock and precipitated into the chasm
thus my retreat would be cut off and the evils from which i was
endeavouring to rescue another would be experienced by myself

i did not just then reflect that clithero had found access to this hill
by other means and that the avenue by which he came would be equally
commodious to me i believed my destiny to hang upon the expedition with
which i should recross this gulf the moments that were spent in these
deliberations were critical and i shuddered to observe that the trunk
was held in its place by one or two fibres which were already stretched
almost to breaking

to pass along the trunk rendered slippery by the wet and unsteadfast by
the wind was imminently dangerous to maintain my hold in passing in
defiance of the whirlwind required the most vigorous exertions for
this end it was necessary to discommode myself of my cloak and of the
volume which i carried in the pocket of my cloak i believed there was
no reason to dread their being destroyed or purloined if left for a
few hours or a day in this recess if laid beside a stone under
shelter of this cliff they would no doubt remain unmolested till the
disappearance of the storm should permit me to revisit this spot in the
afternoon or on the morrow

just as i had disposed of these encumbrances and had risen from my seat
my attention was again called to the opposite steep by the most
unwelcome object that at this time could possibly occur something was
perceived moving among the bushes and rocks which for a time i hoped
was no more than a raccoon or opossum but which presently appeared to
be a panther his gray coat extended claws fiery eyes and a cry which
he at that moment uttered and which by its resemblance to the human
voice is peculiarly terrific denoted him to be the most ferocious and
untamable of that detested race

footnote the gray cougar this animal has all the essential
characteristics of a tiger though somewhat inferior in size and
strength these are such as to make him equally formidable to man

the industry of our hunters has nearly banished animals of prey from
these precincts the fastnesses of norwalk however could not but
afford refuge to some of them of late i had met them so rarely that my
fears were seldom alive and i trod without caution the ruggedest and
most solitary haunts still however i had seldom been unfurnished in
my rambles with the means of defence

my temper never delighted in carnage and blood i found no pleasure in
plunging into bogs wading through rivulets and penetrating thickets
for the sake of dispatching woodcocks and squirrels to watch their
gambols and flittings and invite them to my hand was my darling
amusement when loitering among the woods and the rocks it was much
otherwise however with regard to rattlesnakes and panthers these i
thought it no breach of duty to exterminate wherever they could be
found these judicious and sanguinary spoilers were equally the enemies
of man and of the harmless race that sported in the trees and many of
their skins are still preserved by me as trophies of my juvenile
prowess

as hunting was never my trade or my sport i never loaded myself with
fowling-piece or rifle assiduous exercise had made me master of a
weapon of much easier carriage and within a moderate distance more
destructive and unerring this was the tomahawk with this i have often
severed an oak-branch and cut the sinews of a catamount at the
distance of sixty feet

the unfrequency with which i had lately encountered this foe and the
encumbrance of provision made me neglect on this occasion to bring
with me my usual arms the beast that was now before me when stimulated
by hunger was accustomed to assail whatever could provide him with a
banquet of blood he would set upon the man and the deer with equal and
irresistible ferocity his sagacity was equal to his strength and he
seemed able to discover when his antagonist was armed and prepared for
defence

my past experience enabled me to estimate the full extent of my danger
he sat on the brow of the steep eyeing the bridge and apparently
deliberating whether he should cross it it was probable that he had
scented my footsteps thus far and should he pass over his vigilance
could scarcely fail of detecting my asylum the pit into which clithero
had sunk from my view was at some distance to reach it was the first
impulse of my fear but this could not be done without exciting the
observation and pursuit of this enemy i deeply regretted the untoward
chance that had led me when i first came over to a different shelter

should he retain his present station my danger was scarcely lessened
to pass over in the face of a famished tiger was only to rush upon my
fate the falling of the trunk which had lately been so anxiously
deprecated was now with no less solicitude desired every new gust i
hoped would tear asunder its remaining bands and by cutting off all
communication between the opposite steeps place me in security

my hopes however were destined to be frustrated the fibres of the
prostrate tree were obstinately tenacious of their hold and presently
the animal scrambled down the rock and proceeded to cross it

of all kinds of death that which now menaced me was the most abhorred
to die by disease or by the hand of a fellow-creature was propitious
and lenient in comparison with being rent to pieces by the fangs of this
savage to perish in this obscure retreat by means so impervious to the
anxious curiosity of my friends to lose my portion of existence by so
untoward and ignoble a destiny was insupportable i bitterly deplored
my rashness in coming hither unprovided for an encounter like this

the evil of my present circumstances consisted chiefly in suspense my
death was unavoidable but my imagination had leisure to torment itself
by anticipations one foot of the savage was slowly and cautiously moved
after the other he struck his claws so deeply into the bark that they
were with difficulty withdrawn at length he leaped upon the ground we
were now separated by an interval of scarcely eight feet to leave the
spot where i crouched was impossible behind and beside me the cliff
rose perpendicularly and before me was this grim and terrific visage i
shrunk still closer to the ground and closed my eyes

from this pause of horror i was aroused by the noise occasioned by a
second spring of the animal he leaped into the pit in which i had so
deeply regretted that i had not taken refuge and disappeared my rescue
was so sudden and so much beyond my belief or my hope that i doubted
for a moment whether my senses did not deceive me this opportunity of
escape was not to be neglected i left my place and scrambled over the
trunk with a precipitation which had liked to have proved fatal the
tree groaned and shook under me the wind blew with unexampled violence
and i had scarcely reached the opposite steep when the roots were
severed from the rock and the whole fell thundering to the bottom of the
chasm

my trepidations were not speedily quieted i looked back with wonder on
my hairbreadth escape and on that singular concurrence of events which
had placed me in so short a period in absolute security had the trunk
fallen a moment earlier i should have been imprisoned on the hill or
thrown headlong had its fall been delayed another moment i should have
been pursued for the beast now issued from his den and testified his
surprise and disappointment by tokens the sight of which made my blood
run cold

he saw me and hastened to the verge of the chasm he squatted on his
hind-legs and assumed the attitude of one preparing to leap my
consternation was excited afresh by these appearances it seemed at
first as if the rift was too wide for any power of muscles to carry him
in safety over but i knew the unparalleled agility of this animal and
that his experience had made him a better judge of the practicability of
this exploit than i was still there was hope that he would relinquish
this design as desperate this hope was quickly at an end he sprung
and his fore-legs touched the verge of the rock on which i stood in
spite of vehement exertions however the surface was too smooth and too
hard to allow him to make good his hold he fell and a piercing cry
uttered below showed that nothing had obstructed his descent to the
bottom

thus was i again rescued from death nothing but the pressure of famine
could have prompted this savage to so audacious and hazardous an effort
but by yielding to this impulse he had made my future visits to this
spot exempt from peril clithero was likewise relieved from a danger
that was imminent and unforeseen prowling over these grounds the
panther could scarcely have failed to meet with this solitary fugitive

had the animal lived my first duty would have been to have sought him
out and assailed him with my tomahawk but no undertaking would have
been more hazardous lurking in the grass or in the branches of a tree
his eye might have descried my approach he might leap upon me
unperceived and my weapon would be useless

with a heart beating with unwonted rapidity i once more descended the
cliff entered the cavern and arrived at huntly farm drenched with
rain and exhausted by fatigue

by night the storm was dispelled but my exhausted strength would not
allow me to return to the mountain at the customary hour i retired to
my chamber i incessantly ruminated on the adventures of the last day
and inquired into the conduct which i was next to pursue

the bridge being destroyed my customary access was cut off there was
no possibility of restoring this bridge my strength would not suffice
to drag a fallen tree from a distance and there was none whose position
would abridge or supersede that labour some other expedient must
therefore be discovered to pass this chasm

i reviewed the circumstances of my subterranean journey the cavern was
imperfectly explored its branches might be numerous that which i had
hitherto pursued terminated in an opening at a considerable distance
from the bottom other branches might exist some of which might lead to
the foot of the precipice and thence a communication might be found
with the summit of the interior hill

the danger of wandering into dark and untried paths and the
commodiousness of that road which had at first been taken were
sufficient reasons for having hitherto suspended my examination of the
different branches of this labyrinth now my customary road was no
longer practicable and another was to be carefully explored for this
end on my next journey to the mountain i determined to take with me a
lamp and unravel this darksome maze this project i resolved to execute
the next day

i now recollected what if it had more seasonably occurred would have
taught me caution some months before this a farmer living in the
skirts of norwalk discovered two marauders in his field whom he
imagined to be a male and female panther they had destroyed some sheep
and had been hunted by the farmer with long and fruitless diligence
sheep had likewise been destroyed in different quarters but the owners
had fixed the imputation of the crime upon dogs many of whom had atoned
for their supposed offences by their death he who had mentioned his
discovery of panthers received little credit from his neighbours
because a long time had elapsed since these animals were supposed to
have been exiled from this district and because no other person had
seen them the truth of this seemed now to be confirmed by the testimony
of my own senses but if the rumour were true there still existed
another of these animals who might harbour in the obscurities of this
desert and against whom it was necessary to employ some precaution
henceforth i resolved never to traverse the wilderness unfurnished with
my tomahawk

these images mingled with those which the contemplation of futurity
suggested floated for a time in my brain but at length gave place to
sleep




chapter xiii


since my return home my mind had been fully occupied by schemes and
reflections relative to clithero the project suggested by thee and to
which i had determined to devote my leisure was forgotten or
remembered for a moment and at wide intervals what however was nearly
banished from my waking thoughts occurred in an incongruous and
half-seen form to my dreams during my sleep the image of waldegrave
flitted before me methought the sentiment that impelled him to visit me
was not affection or complacency but inquietude and anger some service
or duty remained to be performed by me which i had culpably neglected
to inspirit my zeal to awaken my remembrance and incite me to the
performance of this duty did this glimmering messenger this
half-indignant apparition come

i commonly awake soon enough to mark the youngest dawn of the morning
now in consequence perhaps of my perturbed sleep i opened my eyes
before the stars had lost any of their lustre this circumstance
produced some surprise until the images that lately hovered in my fancy
were recalled and furnished somewhat like a solution of the problem
connected with the image of my dead friend was that of his sister the
discourse that took place at our last interview the scheme of
transcribing for thy use all the letters which during his short but
busy life i received from him the nature of this correspondence and
the opportunity which this employment would afford me of contemplating
these ample and precious monuments of the intellectual existence and
moral pre-eminence of my friend occurred to my thoughts

the resolution to prosecute the task was revived the obligation of
benevolence with regard to clithero was not discharged this neither
duty nor curiosity would permit to be overlooked or delayed but why
should my whole attention and activity be devoted to this man the hours
which were spent at home and in my chamber could not be more usefully
employed than in making my intended copy

in a few hours after sunrise i purposed to resume my way to the
mountain could this interval be appropriated to a better purpose than
in counting over my friend's letters setting them apart from my own
and preparing them for that transcription from which i expected so high
and yet so mournful a gratification

this purpose by no violent union was blended with the recollection of
my dream this recollection infused some degree of wavering and
dejection into my mind in transcribing these letters i should violate
pathetic and solemn injunctions frequently repeated by the writer was
there some connection between this purpose and the incidents of my
vision was the latter sent to enforce the interdictions which had been
formerly imposed

thou art not fully acquainted with the intellectual history of thy
brother some information on that head will be necessary to explain the
nature of that reluctance which i now feel to comply with thy request
and which had formerly so much excited thy surprise

waldegrave like other men early devoted to meditation and books had
adopted at different periods different systems of opinion on topics
connected with religion and morals his earliest creeds tended to efface
the impressions of his education to deify necessity and universalize
matter to destroy the popular distinctions between soul and body and
to dissolve the supposed connection between the moral condition of man
anterior and subsequent to death

this creed he adopted with all the fulness of conviction and propagated
with the utmost zeal soon after our friendship commenced fortune
placed us at a distance from each other and no intercourse was allowed
but by the pen our letters however were punctual and copious those
of waldegrave were too frequently devoted to the defence of his
favourite tenets

thou art acquainted with the revolution that afterwards took place in
his mind placed within the sphere of religious influence and listening
daily to the reasonings and exhortations of mr s   whose benign
temper and blameless deportment was a visible and constant lesson he
insensibly resumed the faith which he had relinquished and became the
vehement opponent of all that he had formerly defended the chief object
of his labours in this new state of his mind was to counteract the
effect of his former reasonings on my opinions

at this time other changes took place in his situation in consequence
of which we were once more permitted to reside under the same roof the
intercourse now ceased to be by letter and the subtle and laborious
argumentations which he had formerly produced against religion and
which were contained in a permanent form were combated in transient
conversation he was not only eager to subvert those opinions which he
had contributed to instil into me but was anxious that the letters and
manuscripts which had been employed in their support should be
destroyed he did not fear wholly or chiefly on my own account he
believed that the influence of former reasonings on my faith would be
sufficiently eradicated by the new but he dreaded lest these
manuscripts might fall into other hands and thus produce mischiefs
which it would not be in his power to repair with regard to me the
poison had been followed by its antidote but with respect to others
these letters would communicate the poison when the antidote could not
be administered

i would not consent to this sacrifice i did not entirely abjure the
creed which had with great copiousness and eloquence been defended in
these letters besides mixed up with abstract reasonings were
numberless passages which elucidated the character and history of my
friend these were too precious to be consigned to oblivion and to take
them out of their present connection and arrangement would be to
mutilate and deform them

his entreaties and remonstrances were earnest and frequent but always
ineffectual he had too much purity of motives to be angry at my
stubbornness but his sense of the mischievous tendency of these letters
was so great that my intractability cost him many a pang

he was now gone and i had not only determined to preserve these
monuments but had consented to copy them for the use of another for
the use of one whose present and eternal welfare had been the chief
object of his cares and efforts thou like others of thy sex art
unaccustomed to metaphysical refinements thy religion is the growth of
sensibility and not of argument thou art not fortified and prepossessed
against the subtleties with which the being and attributes of the deity
have been assailed would it be just to expose thee to pollution and
depravity from this source to make thy brother the instrument of thy
apostasy the author of thy fall that brother whose latter days were so
ardently devoted to cherishing the spirit of devotion in thy heart

these ideas now occurred with more force than formerly i had promised
not without reluctance to give thee the entire copy of his letters but
i now receded from this promise i resolved merely to select for thy
perusal such as were narrative or descriptive this could not be done
with too much expedition it was still dark but my sleep was at an end
and by a common apparatus that lay beside my bed i could instantly
produce a light

the light was produced and i proceeded to the cabinet where all my
papers and books are deposited this was my own contrivance and
workmanship undertaken by the advice of sarsefield who took infinite
pains to foster that mechanical genius which displayed itself so early
and so forcibly in thy friend the key belonging to this was like the
cabinet itself of singular structure for greater safety it was
constantly placed in a closet which was likewise locked

the key was found as usual and the cabinet opened the letters were
bound together in a compact form lodged in a parchment case and placed
in a secret drawer this drawer would not have been detected by common
eyes and it opened by the motion of a spring of whose existence none
but the maker was conscious this drawer i had opened before i went to
sleep and the letters were then safe

thou canst not imagine my confusion and astonishment when on opening
the drawer i perceived that the packet was gone i looked with more
attention and put my hand within it but the space was empty whither
had it gone and by whom was it purloined i was not conscious of having
taken it away yet no hands but mine could have done it on the last
evening i had doubtless removed it to some other corner but had
forgotten it i tasked my understanding and my memory i could not
conceive the possibility of any motives inducing me to alter my
arrangements in this respect and was unable to recollect that i had
made this change

what remained this invaluable relic had disappeared every thought and
every effort must be devoted to the single purpose of regaining it as
yet i did not despair until i had opened and ransacked every part of
the cabinet in vain i did not admit the belief that i had lost it even
then this persuasion was tumultuous and fluctuating it had vanished to
my senses but these senses were abused and depraved to have passed of
its own accord through the pores of this wood was impossible but if
it were gone thus did it escape

i was lost in horror and amazement i explored every nook a second and a
third time but still it eluded my eye and my touch i opened my closets
and cases i pried everywhere unfolded every article of clothing
turned and scrutinized every instrument and tool but nothing availed

my thoughts were not speedily collected or calmed i threw myself on the
bed and resigned myself to musing that my loss was irretrievable was a
supposition not to be endured yet ominous terrors haunted me a
whispering intimation that a relic which i valued more than life was
torn forever away by some malignant and inscrutable destiny the same
power that had taken it from this receptacle was able to waft it over
the ocean or the mountains and condemn me to a fruitless and eternal
search

but what was he that committed the theft thou only of the beings who
live wast acquainted with the existence of these manuscripts thou art
many miles distant and art utterly a stranger to the mode or place of
their concealment not only access to the cabinet but access to the
room without my knowledge and permission was impossible both were
locked during this night not five hours had elapsed since the cabinet
and drawer had been opened and since the letters had been seen and
touched being in their ordinary position during this interval the
thief had entered and despoiled me of my treasure

this event so inexplicable and so dreadful threw my soul into a kind
of stupor or distraction from which i was suddenly roused by a footstep
softly moving in the entry near my door i started from my bed as if i
had gained a glimpse of the robber before i could run to the door some
one knocked i did not think upon the propriety of answering the signal
but hastened with tremulous fingers and throbbing heart to open the
door my uncle in his night-dress and apparently just risen from his
bed stood before me

he marked the eagerness and perturbation of my looks and inquired into
the cause i did not answer his inquiries his appearance in my chamber
and in this guise added to my surprise my mind was full of the late
discovery and instantly conceived some connection between this
unseasonable visit and my lost manuscript i interrogated him in my turn
as to the cause of his coming

why said he i came to ascertain whether it was you or not who
amused himself so strangely at this time of night what is the matter
with you why are you up so early

i told him that i had been roused by my dreams and finding no
inclination to court my slumber back again i had risen though earlier
by some hours than the usual period of my rising

but why did you go up-stairs you might easily imagine that the sound
of your steps would alarm those below who would be puzzled to guess who
it was that had thought proper to amuse himself in this manner

up-stairs i have not left my room this night it is not ten minutes
since i awoke and my door has not since been opened

indeed that is strange nay it is impossible it was your feet surely
that i heard pacing so solemnly and indefatigably across the long
room for near an hour i could not for my life conjecture for a
time who it was but finally concluded that it was you there was
still however some doubt and i came hither to satisfy myself

these tidings were adapted to raise all my emotions to a still higher
pitch i questioned him with eagerness as to the circumstances he had
noticed he said he had been roused by a sound whose power of
disturbing him arose not from its loudness but from its uncommonness
he distinctly heard some one pacing to and fro with bare feet in the
long room this sound continued with little intermission for an hour
he then noticed a cessation of the walking and a sound as if some one
were lifting the lid of the large cedar chest that stood in the corner
of this room the walking was not resumed and all was silent he
listened for a quarter of an hour and busied himself in conjecturing
the cause of this disturbance the most probable conclusion was that
the walker was his nephew and his curiosity had led him to my chamber
to ascertain the truth

this dwelling has three stories the two lower stories are divided into
numerous apartments the upper story constitutes a single room whose
sides are the four walls of the house and whose ceiling is the roof
this room is unoccupied except by lumber and imperfectly lighted by a
small casement at one end in this room were footsteps heard by my
uncle

the staircase leading to it terminated in a passage near my door i
snatched the candle and desiring him to follow me added that i would
ascertain the truth in a moment he followed but observed that the
walking had ceased long enough for the person to escape

i ascended to the room and looked behind and among the tables and
chairs and casks which were confusedly scattered through it but found
nothing in the shape of man the cedar chest spoken of by mr huntly
contained old books and remnants of maps and charts whose
worthlessness unfitted them for accomodation elsewhere the lid was
without hinges or lock i examined this repository but there was
nothing which attracted my attention

the way between the kitchen-door and the door of the long room had no
impediments both were usually unfastened but the motives by which any
stranger to the dwelling or indeed any one within it could be prompted
to choose this place and hour for an employment of this kind were
wholly incomprehensible

when the family rose inquiries were made but no satisfaction was
obtained the family consisted only of four persons my uncle my two
sisters and myself i mentioned to them the loss i had sustained but
their conjectures were no less unsatisfactory on this than on the former
incident

there was no end to my restless meditations waldegrave was the only
being besides myself acquainted with the secrets of my cabinet during
his life these manuscripts had been the objects of perpetual solicitude
to gain possession to destroy or secrete them was the strongest of his
wishes had he retained his sensibility on the approach of death no
doubt he would have renewed with irresistible solemnity his
injunctions to destroy them

now however they had vanished there were no materials of conjecture
no probabilities to be weighed or suspicions to revolve human artifice
or power was unequal to this exploit means less than preternatural
would not furnish a conveyance for this treasure

it was otherwise with regard to this unseasonable walker his
inducements indeed were beyond my power to conceive but to enter these
doors and ascend these stairs demanded not the faculties of any being
more than human

this intrusion and the pillage of my cabinet were contemporary events
was there no more connection between them than that which results from
time was not the purloiner of my treasure and the wanderer the same
person i could not reconcile the former incident with the attributes of
man and yet a secret faith not to be outrooted or suspended swayed
me and compelled me to imagine that the detection of this visitant
would unveil the thief

these thoughts were pregnant with dejection and reverie clithero
during the day was forgotten on the succeeding night my intentions
with regard to this man returned i derived some slender consolation
from reflecting that time in its long lapse and ceaseless revolutions
might dissipate the gloom that environed me meanwhile i struggled to
dismiss the images connected with my loss and to think only of clithero

my impatience was as strong as ever to obtain another interview with
this man i longed with vehemence for the return of day i believed that
every moment added to his sufferings intellectual and physical and
confided in the efficacy of my presence to alleviate or suspend them
the provisions i had left would be speedily consumed and the abstinence
of three days was sufficient to undermine the vital energies i
sometimes hesitated whether i ought not instantly to depart it was
night indeed but the late storm had purified the air and the radiance
of a full moon was universal and dazzling

from this attempt i was deterred by reflecting that my own frame needed
the repairs of sleep toil and watchfulness if prolonged another day
would deeply injure a constitution by no means distinguished for its
force i must therefore compel if it were possible some hours of
repose i prepared to retire to bed when a new incident occurred to
divert my attention for a time from these designs




chapter xiv


while sitting alone by the parlour-fire marking the effects of
moonlight i noted one on horseback coming towards the gate at first
sight methought his shape and guise were not wholly new to me but all
that i could discern was merely a resemblance to some one whom i had
before seen presently he stopped and looking towards the house made
inquiries of a passenger who chanced to be near being apparently
satisfied with the answers he received he rode with a quick pace into
the court and alighted at the door i started from my seat and going
forth waited with some impatience to hear his purpose explained

he accosted me with the formality of a stranger and asked if a young
man by name edgar huntly resided here being answered in the
affirmative and being requested to come in he entered and seated
himself without hesitation by the fire some doubt and anxiety were
visible in his looks he seemed desirous of information upon some topic
and yet betrayed terror lest the answers he might receive should subvert
some hope or confirm some foreboding

meanwhile i scrutinized his features with much solicitude a nearer and
more deliberate view convinced me that the first impression was just
but still i was unable to call up his name or the circumstances of our
former meeting the pause was at length ended by his saying in a
faltering voice 

my name is weymouth i came hither to obtain information on a subject
in which my happiness is deeply concerned

at the mention of his name i started it was a name too closely
connected with the image of thy brother not to call up affecting and
vivid recollections weymouth thou knowest was thy brother's friend
it is three years since this man left america during which time no
tidings had been heard of him at least by thy brother he had now
returned and was probably unacquainted with the fate of his friend

after an anxious pause he continued since my arrival i have heard of
an event which has on many accounts given me the deepest sorrow i
loved waldegrave and know not any person in the world whose life was
dearer to me than his there were considerations however which made it
more precious to me than the life of one whose merits might be greater
with his life my own existence and property were i have reason to
think inseparably united

on my return to my country after a long absence i made immediate
inquiries after him i was informed of his untimely death i had
questions of infinite moment to my happiness to decide with regard to
the state and disposition of his property i sought out those of his
friends who had maintained with him the most frequent and confidential
intercourse but they could not afford me any satisfaction at length i
was informed that a young man of your name and living in this district
had enjoyed more of his affection and society than any other had
regulated the property which he left behind and was best qualified to
afford the intelligence which i sought you it seems are this person
and of you i must make inquiries to which i conjure you to return
sincere and explicit answers

that said i i shall find no difficulty in doing whatever questions
you shall think proper to ask i will answer with readiness and truth

what kind of property and to what amount was your friend possessed of
at his death

it was money and consisted of deposits at the bank of north america
the amount was little short of eight thousand dollars

on whom has this property devolved

his sister was his only kindred and she is now in possession of it

did he leave any will by which he directed the disposition of his
property while thus speaking weymouth fixed his eyes upon my
countenance and seemed anxious to pierce into my inmost soul i was
somewhat surprised at his questions but much more at the manner in
which they were put i answered him however without delay he left
no will nor was any paper discovered by which we could guess at his
intentions no doubt indeed had he made a will his sister would have
been placed precisely in the same condition in which she now is he was
not only bound to her by the strongest ties of kindred but by affection
and gratitude

weymouth now withdrew his eyes from my face and sunk into a mournful
reverie he sighed often and deeply this deportment and the strain of
his inquiries excited much surprise his interest in the fate of
waldegrave ought to have made the information he had received a source
of satisfaction rather than of regret the property which waldegrave
left was much greater than his mode of life and his own professions had
given us reason to expect but it was no more than sufficient to insure
to thee an adequate subsistence it ascertained the happiness of those
who were dearest to waldegrave and placed them forever beyond the reach
of that poverty which had hitherto beset them i made no attempt to
interrupt the silence but prepared to answer any new interrogatory at
length weymouth resumed 

waldegrave was a fortunate man to amass so considerable a sum in so
short a time i remember when we parted he was poor he used to lament
that his scrupulous integrity precluded him from all the common roads to
wealth he did not contemn riches but he set the highest value upon
competence and imagined that he was doomed forever to poverty his
religious duty compelled him to seek his livelihood by teaching a school
of blacks the labour was disproportioned to his feeble constitution
and the profit was greatly disproportioned to the labour it scarcely
supplied the necessities of nature and was reduced sometimes even below
that standard by his frequent indisposition i rejoice to find that his
scruples had somewhat relaxed their force and that he had betaken
himself to some more profitable occupation pray what was his new way
of business

nay said i his scruples continued as rigid in this respect as
ever he was teacher of the negro freeschool when he died

indeed how then came he to amass so much money could he blend any
more lucrative pursuit with his duty as a schoolmaster

so it seems

what was his pursuit

that question i believe none of his friends are qualified to answer
i thought myself acquainted with the most secret transactions of his
life but this had been carefully concealed from me i was not only
unapprized of any other employment of his time but had not the
slightest suspicion of his possessing any property besides his clothes
and books ransacking his papers with a different view i lighted on
his bank-book in which was a regular receipt for seven thousand five
hundred dollars by what means he acquired this money and even the
acquisition of it till his death put us in possession of his papers
was wholly unknown to us

possibly he might have held it in trust for another in this case some
memorandums or letters would be found explaining this affair

true this supposition could not fail to occur in consequence of which
the most diligent search was made among his papers but no shred or
scrap was to be found which countenanced our conjecture

you may reasonably be surprised and perhaps offended said weymouth
at these inquiries but it is time to explain my motives for making
them three years ago i was like waldegrave indigent and earned my
bread by daily labour during seven years service in a public office i
saved from the expenses of subsistence a few hundred dollars i
determined to strike into a new path and with this sum to lay the
foundation of better fortune i turned it into a bulky commodity
freighted and loaded a small vessel and went with it to barcelona in
spain i was not unsuccessful in my projects and changing my abode to
england france and germany according as my interest required i
became finally possessed of sufficient for the supply of all my wants i
then resolved to return to my native country and laying out my money
in land to spend the rest of my days in the luxury and quiet of an
opulent farmer for this end i invested the greatest part of my property
in a cargo of wine from madeira the remainder i turned into a bill of
exchange for seven thousand five hundred dollars i had maintained a
friendly correspondence with waldegrave during my absence there was no
one with whom i had lived on terms of so much intimacy and had
boundless confidence in his integrity to him therefore i determined to
transmit this bill requesting him to take the money into safe-keeping
until my return in this manner i endeavoured to provide against the
accidents that might befall my person or my cargo in crossing the ocean

it was my fate to encounter the worst of these disasters we were
overtaken by a storm my vessel was driven ashore on the coast of
portugal my cargo was utterly lost and the greater part of the crew
and passengers were drowned i was rescued from the same fate by some
fishermen in consequence of the hardships to which i had been exposed
having laboured for several days at the pumps and spent the greater
part of a winter night hanging from the rigging of the ship and
perpetually beaten by the waves i contracted a severe disease which
bereaved me of the use of my limbs the fishermen who rescued me carried
me to their huts and there i remained three weeks helpless and
miserable

that part of the coast on which i was thrown was in the highest
degree sterile and rude its few inhabitants subsisted precariously on
the produce of the ocean their dwellings were of mud low filthy
dark and comfortless their fuel was the stalks of shrubs sparingly
scattered over a sandy desert their poverty scarcely allowed them salt
and black bread with their fish which was obtained in unequal and
sometimes insufficient quantities and which they ate with all its
impurities and half cooked

my former habits as well as my present indisposition required very
different treatment from what the ignorance and penury of these people
obliged them to bestow i lay upon the moist earth imperfectly
sheltered from the sky and with neither raiment nor fire to keep me
warm my hosts had little attention or compassion to spare to the wants
of others they could not remove me to a more hospitable district and
here without doubt i should have perished had not a monk chanced to
visit their hovels he belonged to a convent of st jago some leagues
farther from the shore which used to send one of its members annually
to inspect the religious concerns of those outcasts happily this was
the period of their visitations

my abode in spain had made me somewhat conversant with its language
the dialect of this monk did not so much differ from castilian but that
with the assistance of latin we were able to converse the jargon of
the fishermen was unintelligible and they had vainly endeavoured to
keep up my spirits by informing me of this expected visit

this monk was touched with compassion at my calamity and speedily
provided the means of my removal to his convent here i was charitably
entertained and the aid of a physician was procured for me he was but
poorly skilled in his profession and rather confirmed than alleviated
my disease the portuguese of his trade especially in remoter
districts are little more than dealers in talismans and nostrums for a
long time i was unable to leave my pallet and had no prospect before me
but that of consuming my days in the gloom of this cloister

all the members of this convent but he who had been my first
benefactor and whose name was chaledro were bigoted and sordid their
chief motive for treating me with kindness was the hope of obtaining a
convert from heresy they spared no pains to subdue my errors and were
willing to prolong my imprisonment in the hope of finally gaining their
end had my fate been governed by those i should have been immured in
this convent and compelled either to adopt their fanatical creed or to
put an end to my own life in order to escape their well-meant
persecutions chaledro however though no less sincere in his faith and
urgent in his entreaties yet finding me invincible exerted his
influence to obtain my liberty

after many delays and strenuous exertions of my friend they consented
to remove me to oporto the journey was to be performed in an open cart
over a mountainous country in the heats of summer the monks
endeavoured to dissuade me from the enterprise for my own sake it
being scarcely possible that one in my feeble state should survive a
journey like this but i despaired of improving my condition by other
means i preferred death to the imprisonment of a portuguese monastery
and knew that i could hope for no alleviation of my disease but from the
skill of scottish or french physicians whom i expected to meet with in
that city i adhered to my purpose with so much vehemence and obstinacy
that they finally yielded to my wishes

my road lay through the wildest and most rugged districts it did not
exceed ninety miles but seven days were consumed on the way the motion
of the vehicle racked me with the keenest pangs and my attendants
concluded that every stage would be my last they had been selected
without due regard to their characters they were knavish and inhuman
and omitted nothing but actual violence to hasten my death they
purposely retarded the journey and protracted to seven what might have
been readily performed in four days they neglected to execute the
orders which they had received respecting my lodging and provisions and
from them as well as from the peasants who were sure to be informed
that i was a heretic i suffered every species of insult and injury my
constitution as well as my frame possessed a fund of strength of which
i had no previous conception in spite of hardship and exposure and
abstinence i at last arrived at oporto

instead of being carried agreeably to chaledro's direction to a
convent of st jago i was left late in the evening in the porch of a
common hospital my attendants having laid me on the pavement and
loaded me with imprecations left me to obtain admission by my own
efforts i passed the livelong night in this spot and in the morning
was received into the house in a state which left it uncertain whether i
was alive or dead

after recovering my sensibility i made various efforts to procure a
visit from some english merchant this was no easy undertaking for one
in my deplorable condition i was too weak to articulate my words
distinctly and these words were rendered by my foreign accent
scarcely intelligible the likelihood of my speedy death made the people
about me more indifferent to my wants and petitions

i will not dwell upon my repeated disappointments but content myself
with mentioning that i gained the attention of a french gentleman whose
curiosity brought him to view the hospital through him i obtained a
visit from an english merchant and finally gained the notice of a
person who formerly resided in america and of whom i had imperfect
knowledge by their kindness i was removed from the hospital to a
private house a scottish surgeon was summoned to my assistance and in
seven months i was restored to my present state of health

at oporto i embarked in an american ship for new york i was
destitute of all property and relied for the payment of the debts
which i was obliged to contract as well as for my future subsistence
on my remittance to waldegrave i hastened to philadelphia and was soon
informed that my friend was dead his death had taken place a long time
since my remittance to him hence this disaster was a subject of regret
chiefly on his own account i entertained no doubt but that my property
had been secured and that either some testamentary directions or some
papers had been left behind respecting this affair

i sought out those who were formerly our mutual acquaintance i found
that they were wholly strangers to his affairs they could merely relate
some particulars of his singular death and point out the lodgings which
he formerly occupied hither i forthwith repaired and discovered that
he lived in this house with his sister disconnected with its other
inhabitants they described his mode of life in terms that showed them
to be very imperfectly acquainted with it it was easy indeed to infer
from their aspect and manners that little sympathy or union could have
subsisted between them and their co-tenants and this inference was
confirmed by their insinuations the growth of prejudice and envy they
told me that waldegrave's sister had gone to live in the country but
whither or for how long she had not condescended to inform them and
they did not care to ask she was a topping dame whose notions were
much too high for her station who was more nice than wise and yet was
one who could stoop when it most became her to stand upright it was no
business of theirs but they could not but mention their suspicions that
she had good reasons for leaving the city and for concealing the place
of her retreat some things were hard to be disguised they spoke for
themselves and the only way to hinder disagreeable discoveries was to
keep out of sight

i was wholly a stranger to waldegrave's sister i knew merely that he
had such a relation there was nothing therefore to outbalance this
unfavourable report but the apparent malignity and grossness of those
who gave it it was not however her character about which i was
solicitous but merely the place where she might be found and the
suitable inquiries respecting her deceased brother be answered on this
head these people professed utter ignorance and were either unable or
unwilling to direct me to any person in the city who knew more than
themselves after much discourse they at length let fall an
intimation that if any one knew her place of retreat it was probably a
country-lad by name huntly who lived near the forks of
delaware after waldegrave's death this lad had paid his sister a visit
and seemed to be admitted on a very confidential footing she left the
house for the last time in his company and he therefore was most
likely to know what had become of her

the name of huntly was not totally unknown to me i myself was born and
brought up in the neighbouring township of chetasco i had some
knowledge of your family and your name used often to be mentioned by
waldegrave as that of one who at a maturer age would prove himself
useful to his country i determined therefore to apply to you for what
information you could give i designed to visit my father who lives in
chetasco and relieve him from that disquiet which his ignorance of my
fate could not fail to have inspired and both these ends could be thus
at the same time accomplished

before i left the city i thought it proper to apply to the merchant on
whom my bill had been drawn if this bill had been presented and paid
he had doubtless preserved some record of it and hence a clue might be
afforded though every other expedient should fail my usual ill fortune
pursued me upon this occasion for the merchant had lately become
insolvent and to avoid the rage of his creditors had fled without
leaving any vestige of this or similar transactions behind him he had
some years since been an adventurer from holland and was suspected to
have returned thither




chapter xv


i came hither with a heart desponding of success adversity had
weakened my faith in the promises of the future and i was prepared to
receive just such tidings as you have communicated unacquainted with
the secret motives of waldegrave and his sister it is impossible for me
to weigh the probabilities of their rectitude i have only my own
assertion to produce in support of my claim all other evidence all
vouchers and papers which might attest my veracity or sanction my claim
in a court of law are buried in the ocean the bill was transmitted
just before my departure from madeira and the letters by which it was
accompanied informed waldegrave of my design to follow it immediately
hence he did not it is probable acknowledge the receipt of my letters
the vessels in which they were sent arrived in due season i was assured
that all letters were duly deposited in the post-office where at
present mine are not to be found

you assure me that nothing has been found among his papers hinting at
any pecuniary transaction between him and me some correspondence passed
between us previous to that event have no letters with my signature
been found are you qualified by your knowledge of his papers to
answer me explicitly is it not possible for some letters to have been
mislaid

i am qualified said i to answer your inquiries beyond any other
person in the world waldegrave maintained only general intercourse with
the rest of mankind with me his correspondence was copious and his
confidence as i imagined without bounds his books and papers were
contained in a single chest at his lodgings the keys of which he had
about him when he died these keys i carried to his sister and was
authorized by her to open and examine the contents of this chest this
was done with the utmost care these papers are now in my possession
among them no paper of the tenor you mention was found and no letter
with your signature neither mary waldegrave nor i are capable of
disguising the truth or committing an injustice the moment she receives
conviction of your right she will restore this money to you the moment
i imbibe this conviction i will exert all my influence and it is not
small to induce her to restore it permit me however to question you
in your turn who was the merchant on whom your bill was drawn what was
the date of it and when did the bill and its counterparts arrive

i do not exactly remember the date of the bills they were made out
however six days before i myself embarked which happened on the th
of august they were sent by three vessels one of which was bound
to charleston and the others to new york the last arrived within two
days of each other and about the middle of november in the same year
the name of the payer was monteith

after a pause of recollection i answered i will not hesitate to
apprize you of every thing which may throw light upon this transaction
and whether favourable or otherwise to your claim i have told you
among my friend's papers your name is not to be found i must likewise
repeat that the possession of this money by waldegrave was wholly
unknown to us till his death we are likewise unacquainted with any
means by which he could get possession of so large a sum in his own
right he spent no more than his scanty stipend as a teacher though
this stipend was insufficient to supply his wants this bank-receipt is
dated in december a fortnight perhaps after the date that you
have mentioned you will perceive how much this coincidence which could
scarcely have taken place by chance is favourable to your claim

mary waldegrave resides at present at abingdon she will rejoice as
i do to see one who as her brother's friend is entitled to her
affection doubt not but that she will listen with impartiality and
candour to all that you can urge in defence of your title to this money
her decision will not be precipitate but it will be generous and just
and founded on such reasons that even if it be adverse to your wishes
you will be compelled to approve it

i can entertain no doubt he answered as to the equity of my claim
the coincidences you mention are sufficient to convince me that this sum
was received upon my bill but this conviction must necessarily be
confined to myself no one but i can be conscious to the truth of my own
story the evidence on which i build my faith in this case is that of
my own memory and senses but this evidence cannot make itself
conspicuous to you you have nothing but my bare assertion in addition
to some probabilities flowing from the conduct of waldegrave what facts
may exist to corroborate my claim which you have forgotten or which
you may think proper to conceal i cannot judge i know not what is
passing in the secret of your hearts i am unacquainted with the
character of this lady and with yours i have nothing on which to build
surmises and suspicions of your integrity and nothing to generate
unusual confidence the frailty of your virtue and the strength of your
temptations i know not however she decides in this case and whatever
opinion i shall form as to the reasonableness of her decision it will
not become me either to upbraid her or to nourish discontentment and
repinings

i know that my claim has no legal support that if this money be
resigned to me it will be the impulse of spontaneous justice and not
the coercion of law to which i am indebted for it since therefore
the justice of my claim is to be measured not by law but by simple
equity i will candidly acknowledge that as yet it is uncertain
whether i ought to receive even should miss waldegrave be willing to
give it i know my own necessities and schemes and in what degree this
money would be subservient to these but i know not the views and wants
of others and cannot estimate the usefulness of this money to them
however i decide upon your conduct in withholding or retaining it i
shall make suitable allowance for my imperfect knowledge of your motives
and wants as well as for your unavoidable ignorance of mine

i have related my sufferings from shipwreck and poverty not to bias
your judgment or engage your pity but merely because the impulse to
relate them chanced to awake because my heart is softened by the
remembrance of waldegrave who has been my only friend and by the sight
of one whom he loved

i told you that my father lived in chetasco he is now aged and i am
his only child i should have rejoiced in being able to relieve his gray
hairs from labour to which his failing strength cannot be equal this
was one of my inducements in coming to america another was to prepare
the way for a woman whom i married in europe and who is now awaiting
intelligence from me in london her poverty is not less than my own and
by marrying against the wishes of her kindred she has bereaved herself
of all support but that of her husband whether i shall be able to
rescue her from indigence whether i shall alleviate the poverty of my
father or increase it by burdening his scanty friends by my own
maintenance as well as his the future alone can determine

i confess that my stock of patience and hope has never been large and
that my misfortunes have nearly exhausted it the flower of my years has
been consumed in struggling with adversity and my constitution has
received a shock from sickness and mistreatment in portugal which i
cannot expect long to survive but i make you sad he continued i
have said all that i meant to say in this interview i am impatient to
see my father and night has already come i have some miles yet to ride
to his cottage and over a rough road i will shortly visit you again
and talk to you at greater leisure on these and other topics at present
i leave you

i was unwilling to part so abruptly with this guest and entreated him
to prolong his visit but he would not be prevailed upon repeating his
promise of shortly seeing me again he mounted his horse and
disappeared i looked after him with affecting and complex emotions i
reviewed the incidents of this unexpected and extraordinary interview
as if it had existed in a dream an hour had passed and this stranger
had alighted among us as from the clouds to draw the veil from those
obscurities which had bewildered us so long to make visible a new train
of disastrous consequences flowing from the untimely death of thy
brother and to blast that scheme of happiness on which thou and i had
so fondly meditated

but what wilt thou think of this new-born claim the story hadst thou
observed the features and guise of the relater would have won thy
implicit credit his countenance exhibited deep traces of the
afflictions he had endured and the fortitude which he had exercised he
was sallow and emaciated but his countenance was full of seriousness
and dignity a sort of ruggedness of brow the token of great mental
exertion and varied experience argued a premature old age

what a mournful tale is such the lot of those who wander from their
rustic homes in search of fortune our countrymen are prone to
enterprise and are scattered over every sea and every land in pursuit
of that wealth which will not screen them from disease and infirmity
which is missed much oftener than found and which when gained by no
means compensates them for the hardships and vicissitudes endured in the
pursuit

but what if the truth of these pretensions be admitted the money must
be restored to its right owner i know that whatever inconveniences may
follow the deed thou wilt not hesitate to act justly affluence and
dignity however valuable may be purchased too dear honesty will not
take away its keenness from the winter blast its ignominy and
unwholesomeness from servile labour or strip of its charms the life of
elegance and leisure but these unaccompanied with self-reproach are
less deplorable than wealth and honour the possession of which is marred
by our own disapprobation

i know the bitterness of this sacrifice i know the impatience with
which your poverty has formerly been borne how much your early
education is at war with that degradation and obscurity to which your
youth has been condemned how earnestly your wishes panted after a state
which might exempt you from dependence upon daily labour and on the
caprices of others and might secure to you leisure to cultivate and
indulge your love of knowledge and your social and beneficent
affections

your motive for desiring a change of fortune has been greatly enforced
since we have become known to each other thou hast honoured me with thy
affection but that union on which we rely for happiness could not
take place while both of us were poor my habits indeed have made
labour and rustic obscurity less painful than they would prove to my
friend but my present condition is wholly inconsistent with marriage
as long as my exertions are insufficient to maintain us both it would
be unjustifiable to burden you with new cares and duties of this you
are more thoroughly convinced than i am the love of independence and
ease and impatience of drudgery are woven into your constitution
perhaps they are carried to an erroneous extreme and derogate from that
uncommon excellence by which your character is in other respects
distinguished but they cannot be removed

this obstacle was unexpectedly removed by the death of your brother
however justly to be deplored was this catastrophe yet like every
other event some of its consequences were good by giving you
possession of the means of independence and leisure by enabling us to
complete a contract which poverty alone had thus long delayed this
event has been at the same time the most disastrous and propitious
which could have happened

why thy brother should have concealed from us the possession of this
money why with such copious means of indulgence and leisure he
should still pursue his irksome trade and live in so penurious a
manner has been a topic of endless and unsatisfactory conjecture
between us it was not difficult to suppose that this money was held in
trust for another but in that case it was unavoidable that some
document or memorandum or at least some claimant would appear much
time has since elapsed and you have thought yourself at length
justified in appropriating this money to your own use

our flattering prospects are now shut in you must return to your
original poverty and once more depend for precarious subsistence on
your needle you cannot restore the whole for unavoidable expenses and
the change of your mode of living have consumed some part of it for so
much you must consider yourself as weymouth's debtor

repine not my friend at this unlooked-for reverse think upon the
merits and misfortunes of your brother's friend think upon his aged
father whom we shall enable him to rescue from poverty think upon his
desolate wife whose merits are probably at least equal to your own
and whose helplessness is likely to be greater i am not insensible to
the evils which have returned upon us with augmented force after
having for a moment taken their flight i know the precariousness of
my condition and that of my sisters that our subsistence hangs upon the
life of an old man my uncle's death will transfer this property to his
son who is a stranger and an enemy to us and the first act of whose
authority will unquestionably be to turn us forth from these doors
marriage with thee was anticipated with joyous emotions not merely on
my own account or on thine but likewise for the sake of those beloved
girls to whom that event would enable me to furnish an asylum

but wedlock is now more distant than ever mv heart bleeds to think of
the sufferings which my beloved mary is again fated to endure but
regrets are only aggravations of calamity they are pernicious and it
is our duty to shake them off

i can entertain no doubts as to the equity of weymouth's claim so many
coincidences could not have happened by chance the non-appearance of
any letters or papers connected with it is indeed a mysterious
circumstance but why should waldegrave be studious of preserving these
they were useless paper and might without impropriety be cast away or
made to serve any temporary purpose perhaps indeed they still lurk in
some unsuspected corner to wish that time may explain this mystery in a
different manner and so as to permit our retention of this money is
perhaps the dictate of selfishness the transfer to weymouth will not
be productive of less benefit to him and to his family than we should
derive from the use of it

these considerations however will be weighed when we meet meanwhile i
will return to my narrative




chapter xvi


here my friend thou must permit me to pause the following incidents
are of a kind to which the most ardent invention has never conceived a
parallel fortune in her most wayward mood could scarcely be suspected
of an influence like this the scene was pregnant with astonishment and
horror i cannot even now recall it without reviving the dismay and
confusion which i then experienced

possibly the period will arrive when i shall look back without agony on
the perils i have undergone that period is still distant solitude and
sleep are now no more than the signals to summon up a tribe of ugly
phantoms famine and blindness and death and savage enemies never
fail to be conjured up by the silence and darkness of the night i
cannot dissipate them by any efforts of reason sly cowardice requires
the perpetual consolation of light my heart droops when i mark the
decline of the sun and i never sleep but with a candle burning at my
pillow if by any chance i should awake and find myself immersed in
darkness i know not what act of desperation i might be suddenly
impelled to commit

i have delayed this narrative longer than my duty to my friend enjoined
now that i am able to hold a pen i will hasten to terminate that
uncertainty with regard to my fate in which my silence has involved
thee i will recall that series of unheard-of and disastrous
vicissitudes which has constituted the latest portion of my life

i am not certain however that i shall relate them in an intelligible
manner one image runs into another sensations succeed in so rapid a
train that i fear i shall be unable to distribute and express them with
sufficient perspicuity as i look back my heart is sore and aches
within my bosom i am conscious to a kind of complex sentiment of
distress and forlornness that cannot be perfectly portrayed by words
but i must do as well as i can in the utmost vigour of my faculties no
eloquence that i possess would do justice to the tale now in my
languishing and feeble state i shall furnish thee with little more than
a glimpse of the truth with these glimpses transient and faint as they
are thou must be satisfied

i have said that i slept my memory assures me of this it informs me of
the previous circumstances of my laying aside my clothes of placing the
light upon a chair within reach of my pillow of throwing myself upon
the bed and of gazing on the rays of the moon reflected on the wall and
almost obscured by those of the candle i remember my occasional
relapses into fits of incoherent fancies the harbingers of sleep i
remember as it were the instant when my thoughts ceased to flow and my
senses were arrested by the leaden wand of forgetfulness

my return to sensation and to consciousness took place in no such
tranquil scene i emerged from oblivion by degrees so slow and so faint
that their succession cannot be marked when enabled at length to attend
to the information which my senses afforded i was conscious for a time
of nothing but existence it was unaccompanied with lassitude or pain
but i felt disinclined to stretch my limbs or raise my eyelids my
thoughts were wildering and mazy and though consciousness was present
it was disconnected with the locomotive or voluntary power

from this state a transition was speedily effected i perceived that my
posture was supine and that i lay upon my back i attempted to open my
eyes the weight that oppressed them was too great for a slight exertion
to remove the exertion which i made cost me a pang more acute than any
which i ever experienced my eyes however were opened but the
darkness that environed me was as intense as before

i attempted to rise but my limbs were cold and my joints had almost
lost their flexibility my efforts were repeated and at length i
attained a sitting posture i was now sensible of pain in my shoulders
and back i was universally in that state to which the frame is reduced
by blows of a club mercilessly and endlessly repeated my temples
throbbed and my face was covered with clammy and cold drops but that
which threw me into deepest consternation was my inability to see i
turned my head to different quarters i stretched my eyelids and
exerted every visual energy but in vain i was wrapped in the murkiest
and most impenetrable gloom

the first effort of reflection was to suggest the belief that i was
blind that disease is known to assail us in a moment and without
previous warning this surely was the misfortune that had now befallen
me some ray however fleeting and uncertain could not fail to be
discerned if the power of vision were not utterly extinguished in what
circumstances could i possibly be placed from which every particle of
light should by other means be excluded

this led my thoughts into a new train i endeavoured to recall the past
but the past was too much in contradiction to the present and my
intellect was too much shattered by external violence to allow me
accurately to review it

since my sight availed nothing to the knowledge of my condition i
betook myself to other instruments the element which i breathed was
stagnant and cold the spot where i lay was rugged and hard i was
neither naked nor clothed a shirt and trousers composed my dress and
the shoes and stockings which always accompanied these were now
wanting what could i infer from this scanty garb this chilling
atmosphere this stony bed

i had awakened as from sleep what was my condition when i fell asleep
surely it was different from the present then i inhabited a lightsome
chamber and was stretched upon a down bed now i was supine upon a
rugged surface and immersed in palpable obscurity then i was in perfect
health now my frame was covered with bruises and every joint was racked
with pain what dungeon or den had received me and by whose command was
i transported hither

after various efforts i stood upon my feet at first i tottered and
staggered i stretched out my hands on all sides but met only with
vacuity i advanced forward at the third step my foot moved something
which lay upon the ground i stooped and took it up and found on
examination that it was an indian tomahawk this incident afforded me
no hint from which i might conjecture my state

proceeding irresolutely and slowly forward my hands at length touched a
wall this like the flooring was of stone and was rugged and
impenetrable i followed this wall an advancing angle occurred at a
short distance which was followed by similar angles i continued to
explore this clue till the suspicion occurred that i was merely going
round the walls of a vast and irregular apartment

the utter darkness disabled me from comparing directions and distances
this discovery therefore was not made on a sudden and was still
entangled with some doubt my blood recovered some warmth and my
muscles some elasticity but in proportion as my sensibility returned
my pains augmented overpowered by my fears and my agonies i desisted
from my fruitless search and sat down supporting my back against the
wall

my excruciating sensations for a time occupied my attention these in
combination with other causes gradually produced a species of delirium
i existed as it were in a wakeful dream with nothing to correct my
erroneous perceptions the images of the past occurred in capricious
combinations and vivid hues methought i was the victim of some tyrant
who had thrust me into a dungeon of his fortress and left me no power
to determine whether he intended i should perish with famine or linger
out a long life in hopeless imprisonment whether the day was shut out
by insuperable walls or the darkness that surrounded me was owing to
the night and to the smallness of those crannies through which daylight
was to be admitted i conjectured in vain

sometimes i imagined myself buried alive methought i had fallen into
seeming death and my friends had consigned me to the tomb from which a
resurrection was impossible that in such a case my limbs would have
been confined to a coffin and my coffin to a grave and that i should
instantly have been suffocated did not occur to destroy my supposition
neither did this supposition overwhelm me with terror or prompt my
efforts at deliverance my state was full of tumult and confusion and
my attention was incessantly divided between my painful sensations and
my feverish dreams

there is no standard by which time can be measured but the succession of
our thoughts and the changes that take place in the external world from
the latter i was totally excluded the former made the lapse of some
hours appear like the tediousness of weeks and months at length a new
sensation recalled my rambling meditations and gave substance to my
fears i now felt the cravings of hunger and perceived that unless my
deliverance were speedily effected i must suffer a tedious and
lingering death

i once more tasked my understanding and my senses to discover the nature
of my present situation and the means of escape i listened to catch
some sound i heard an unequal and varying echo sometimes near and
sometimes distant sometimes dying away and sometimes swelling into
loudness it was unlike any thing i had before heard but it was evident
that it arose from wind sweeping through spacious halls and winding
passages these tokens were incompatible with the result of the
examination i had made if my hands were true i was immured between
walls through which there was no avenue

i now exerted my voice and cried as loud as my wasted strength would
admit its echoes were sent back to me in broken and confused sounds and
from above this effort was casual but some part of that uncertainty in
which i was involved was instantly dispelled by it in passing through
the cavern on the former day i have mentioned the verge of the pit at
which i arrived to acquaint me as far as was possible with the
dimensions of the place i had hallooed with all my force knowing that
sound is reflected according to the distance and relative positions of
the substances from which it is repelled

the effect produced by my voice on this occasion resembled with
remarkable exactness the effect which was then produced was i then
shut up in the same cavern had i reached the brink of the same
precipice and been thrown headlong into that vacuity whence else could
arise the bruises which i had received but from my fall yet all
remembrance of my journey hither was lost i had determined to explore
this cave on the ensuing day but my memory informed me not that this
intention had been carried into effect still it was only possible to
conclude that i had come hither on my intended expedition and had been
thrown by another or had by some ill chance fallen into the pit

this opinion was conformable to what i had already observed the
pavement and walls were rugged like those of the footing and sides of
the cave through which i had formerly passed

but if this were true what was the abhorred catastrophe to which i was
now reserved the sides of this pit were inaccessible human footsteps
would never wander into these recesses my friends were unapprized of my
forlorn state here i should continue till wasted by famine in this
grave should i linger out a few days in unspeakable agonies and then
perish forever

the inroads of hunger were already experienced and this knowledge of
the desperateness of my calamity urged me to frenzy i had none but
capricious and unseen fate to condemn the author of my distress and
the means he had taken to decoy me hither were incomprehensible surely
my senses were fettered or depraved by some spell i was still asleep
and this was merely a tormenting vision or madness had seized me and
the darkness that environed and the hunger that afflicted me existed
only in my own distempered imagination

the consolation of these doubts could not last long every hour added to
the proof that my perceptions were real my hunger speedily became
ferocious i tore the linen of my shirt between my teeth and swallowed
the fragments i felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh from my arm
my heart overflowed with cruelty and i pondered on the delight i should
experience in rending some living animal to pieces and drinking its
blood and grinding its quivering fibres between my teeth

this agony had already passed beyond the limits of endurance i saw that
time instead of bringing respite or relief would only aggravate my
wants and that my only remaining hope was to die before i should be
assaulted by the last extremes of famine i now recollected that a
tomahawk was at hand and rejoiced in the possession of an instrument by
which i could so effectually terminate my sufferings

i took it in my hand moved its edge over my fingers and reflected on
the force that was required to make it reach my heart i investigated
the spot where it should enter and strove to fortify myself with
resolution to repeat the stroke a second or third time if the first
should prove insufficient i was sensible that i might fail to inflict a
mortal wound but delighted to consider that the blood which would be
made to flow would finally release me and that meanwhile my pains would
be alleviated by swallowing this blood

you will not wonder that i felt some reluctance to employ so fatal
though indispensable a remedy i once more ruminated on the possibility
of rescuing myself by other means i now reflected that the upper
termination of the wall could not be at an immeasurable distance from
the pavement i had fallen from a height but if that height had been
considerable instead of being merely bruised should i not have been
dashed into pieces

gleams of hope burst anew upon my soul was it not possible i asked to
reach the top of this pit the sides were rugged and uneven would not
their projectures and abruptnesses serve me as steps by which i might
ascend in safety this expedient was to be tried without delay shortly
my strength would fail and my doom would be irrevocably sealed

i will not enumerate my laborious efforts my alternations of
despondency and confidence the eager and unwearied scrutiny with which
i examined the surface the attempts which i made and the failures
which for a time succeeded each other a hundred times when i had
ascended some feet from the bottom i was compelled to relinquish my
undertaking by the untenable smoothness of the spaces which
remained to be gone over a hundred times i threw myself exhausted by
fatigue and my pains on the ground the consciousness was gradually
restored that till i had attempted every part of the wall it was
absurd to despair and i again drew my tottering limbs and aching joints
to that part of the wall which had not been surveyed

at length as i stretched my hand upward i found somewhat that seemed
like a recession in the wall it was possible that this was the top of
the cavity and this might be the avenue to liberty my heart leaped
with joy and i proceeded to climb the wall no undertaking could be
conceived more arduous than this the space between this verge and the
floor was nearly smooth the verge was higher from the bottom than my
head the only means of ascending that were offered me were by my hands
with which i could draw myself upward so as at length to maintain my
hold with my feet

my efforts were indefatigable and at length i placed myself on the
verge when this was accomplished my strength was nearly gone had i
not found space enough beyond this brink to stretch myself at length i
should unavoidably have fallen backward into the pit and all my pains
had served no other end than to deepen my despair and hasten my
destruction

what impediments and perils remained to be encountered i could not
judge i was now inclined to forebode the worst the interval of repose
which was necessary to be taken in order to recruit my strength would
accelerate the ravages of famine and leave me without the power to
proceed

in this state i once more consoled myself that an instrument of death
was at hand i had drawn up with me the tomahawk being sensible that
should this impediment be overcome others might remain that would prove
insuperable before i employed it however i cast my eyes wildly and
languidly around the darkness was no less intense than in the pit
below and yet two objects were distinctly seen

they resembled a fixed and obscure flame they were motionless though
lustrous themselves they created no illumination around them this
circumstance added to others which reminded me of similar objects
noted on former occasions immediately explained the nature of what i
beheld these were the eyes of a panther

thus had i struggled to obtain a post where a savage was lurking and
waited only till my efforts should place me within reach of his fangs
the first impulse was to arm myself against this enemy the
desperateness of my condition was for a moment forgotten the weapon
which was so lately lifted against my own bosom was now raised to defend
my life against the assault of another

there was no time for deliberation and delay in a moment he might
spring from his station and tear me to pieces my utmost speed might not
enable me to reach him where he sat but merely to encounter his
assault i did not reflect how far my strength was adequate to save me
all the force that remained was mustered up and exerted in a throw

no one knows the powers that are latent in his constitution called
forth by imminent dangers our efforts frequently exceed our most
sanguine belief though tottering on the verge of dissolution and
apparently unable to crawl from this spot a force was exerted in this
throw probably greater than i had ever before exerted it was
resistless and unerring i aimed at the middle space between those
glowing orbs it penetrated the skull and the animal fell struggling
and shrieking on the ground

my ears quickly informed me when his pangs were at an end his cries and
his convulsions lasted for a moment and then ceased the effect of his
voice in these subterranean abodes was unspeakably rueful

the abruptness of this incident and the preternatural exertion of my
strength left me in a state of languor and sinking from which slowly
and with difficulty i recovered the first suggestion that occurred was
to feed upon the carcass of this animal my hunger had arrived at that
pitch where all fastidiousness and scruples are at an end i crept to
the spot i will not shock you by relating the extremes to which dire
necessity had driven me i review this scene with loathing and horror
now that it is past i look back upon it as on some hideous dream the
whole appears to be some freak of insanity no alternative was offered
and hunger was capable of being appeased even by a banquet so
detestable

if this appetite has sometimes subdued the sentiments of nature and
compelled the mother to feed upon the flesh of her offspring it will
not excite amazement that i did not turn from the yet warm blood and
reeking fibres of a brute

one evil was now removed only to give place to another the first
sensations of fullness had scarcely been felt when my stomach was seized
by pangs whose acuteness exceeded all that i ever before experienced i
bitterly lamented my inordinate avidity the excruciations of famine
were better than the agonies which this abhorred meal had produced

death was now impending with no less proximity and certainty though in
a different form death was a sweet relief for my present miseries and
i vehemently longed for its arrival i stretched myself on the ground i
threw myself into every posture that promised some alleviation of this
evil i rolled along the pavement of the cavern wholly inattentive to
the dangers that environed me that i did not fall into the pit whence i
had just emerged must be ascribed to some miraculous chance

how long my miseries endured it is not possible to tell i cannot even
form a plausible conjecture judging by the lingering train of my
sensations i should conjecture that some days elapsed in this
deplorable condition but nature could riot have so long sustained a
conflict like this

gradually my pains subsided and i fell into a deep sleep i was visited
by dreams of a thousand hues they led me to flowing streams and
plenteous banquets which though placed within my view some power
forbade me to approach from this sleep i recovered to the fruition of
solitude and darkness but my frame was in a state less feeble than
before that which i had eaten had produced temporary distress but on
the whole had been of use if this food had not been provided for me i
should scarcely have avoided death i had reason therefore to
congratulate myself on the danger that had lately occurred

i had acted without foresight and yet no wisdom could have prescribed
more salutary measures the panther was slain not from a view to the
relief of my hunger but from the self-preserving and involuntary
impulse had i foreknown the pangs to which my ravenous and bloody meal
would give birth i should have carefully abstained and yet these pangs
were a useful effort of nature to subdue and convert to nourishment the
matter i had swallowed

i was now assailed by the torments of thirst my invention and my
courage were anew bent to obviate this pressing evil i reflected that
there was some recess from this cavern even from the spot where i now
stood before i was doubtful whether in this direction from this pit
any avenue could be found but since the panther had come hither there
was reason to suppose the existence of some such avenue

i now likewise attended to a sound which from its invariable tenor
denoted somewhat different from the whistling of a gale it seemed like
the murmur of a running stream i now prepared to go forward and
endeavour to move along in that direction in which this sound apparently
came

on either side and above my head there was nothing but vacuity my
steps were to be guided by the pavement which though unequal and
rugged appeared on the whole to ascend my safety required that i
should employ both hands and feet in exploring my way

i went on thus for a considerable period the murmur instead of
becoming more distinct gradually died away my progress was arrested by
fatigue and i began once more to despond my exertions produced a
perspiration which while it augmented my thirst happily supplied me
with imperfect means of appeasing it

this expedient would perhaps have been accidentally suggested but my
ingenuity was assisted by remembering the history of certain english
prisoners in bengal whom their merciless enemy imprisoned in a small
room and some of whom preserved themselves alive merely by swallowing
the moisture that flowed from their bodies this experiment i now
performed with no less success

this was slender arid transitory consolation i knew that wandering at
random i might never reach the outlet of this cavern or might be
disabled by hunger and fatigue from going farther than the outlet the
cravings which had lately been satiated would speedily return and my
negligence had cut me off from the resource which had recently been
furnished i thought not till now that a second meal might be
indispensable

to return upon my footsteps to the spot where the dead animal lay was a
heartless project i might thus be placing myself at a hopeless distance
from liberty besides my track could not be retraced i had frequently
deviated from a straight direction for the sake of avoiding impediments
all of which i was sensible was that i was travelling up an irregular
acclivity i hoped some time to reach the summit but had no reason for
adhering to one line of ascent in preference to another

to remain where i was was manifestly absurd whether i mounted or
descended a change of place was most likely to benefit me i resolved
to vary my direction and instead of ascending keep along the side of
what i accounted a hill i had gone some hundred feet when the murmur
before described once more saluted my ear

this sound being imagined to proceed from a running stream could not
but light up joy in the heart of one nearly perishing with thirst i
proceeded with new courage the sound approached no nearer nor became
more distinct but as long as it died not away i was satisfied to
listen and to hope

i was eagerly observant if any the least glimmering of light should
visit this recess at length on the right hand a gleam infinitely
faint caught my attention it was wavering and unequal i directed my
steps towards it it became more vivid and permanent it was of that
kind however which proceeded from a fire kindled with dry sticks and
not from the sun i now heard the crackling of flames

this sound made me pause or at least to proceed with circumspection
at length the scene opened and i found myself at the entrance of a
cave i quickly reached a station when i saw a fire burning at first
no other object was noted but it was easy to infer that the fire was
kindled by men and that they who kindled it could be at no great
distance




chapter xvii


thus was i delivered from my prison and restored to the enjoyment of
the air and the light perhaps the chance was almost miraculous that led
me to this opening in any other direction i might have involved myself
in an inextricable maze and rendered my destruction sure but what now
remained to place me in absolute security beyond the fire i could see
nothing but since the smoke rolled rapidly away it was plain that on
the opposite side the cavern was open to the air

i went forward but my eyes were fixed upon the fire presently in
consequence of changing my station i perceived several feet and the
skirts of blankets i was somewhat startled at these appearances the
legs were naked and scored into uncouth figures the moccasins
which lay beside them and which were adorned in a grotesque manner in
addition to other incidents immediately suggested the suspicion that
they were indians no spectacle was more adapted than this to excite
wonder and alarm had some mysterious power snatched me from the earth
and cast me in a moment into the heart of the wilderness was i still
in the vicinity of my parental habitation or was i thousands of miles
distant

were these the permanent inhabitants of this region or were they
wanderers and robbers while in the heart of the mountain i had
entertained a vague belief that i was still within the precincts of
norwalk this opinion was shaken for a moment by the objects which i now
beheld but it insensibly returned yet how was this opinion to be
reconciled to appearances so strange and uncouth and what measure did a
due regard to my safety enjoin me to take

i now gained a view of four brawny and terrific figures stretched upon
the ground they lay parallel to each other on their left sides in
consequence of which their faces were turned from me between each was
an interval where lay a musket their right hands seemed placed upon the
stocks of their guns as if to seize them on the first moment of alarm

the aperture through which these objects were seen was at the back of
the cave and some feet from the ground it was merely large enough to
suffer a human body to pass it was involved in profound darkness and
there was no danger of being suspected or discovered as long as i
maintained silence and kept out of view

it was easily imagined that these guests would make but a short sojourn
in this spot there was reason to suppose that it was now night and
that after a short repose they would start up and resume their
journey it was my first design to remain shrouded in this covert till
their departure and i prepared to endure imprisonment and thirst
somewhat longer

meanwhile my thoughts were busy in accounting for this spectacle i need
not tell thee that norwalk is the termination of a sterile and narrow
tract which begins in the indian country it forms a sort of rugged and
rocky vein and continues upwards of fifty miles it is crossed in a few
places by narrow and intricate paths by which a communication is
maintained between the farms and settlements on the opposite sides of
the ridge

during former indian wars this rude surface was sometimes traversed by
the red men and they made by means of it frequent and destructive
inroads into the heart of the english settlements during the last war
notwithstanding the progress of population and the multiplied perils of
such an expedition a band of them had once penetrated into norwalk and
lingered long enough to pillage and murder some of the neighbouring
inhabitants

i have reason to remember that event my father's house was placed on
the verge of this solitude eight of these assassins assailed it at the
dead of night my parents and an infant child were murdered in their
beds the house was pillaged and then burnt to the ground happily
myself and my two sisters were abroad upon a visit the preceding day
had been fixed for our return to our father's house but a storm
occurred which made it dangerous to cross the river and by obliging
us to defer our journey rescued us from captivity or death

most men are haunted by some species of terror or antipathy which they
are for the most part able to trace to some incident which befell them
in their early years you will not be surprised that the fate of my
parents and the sight of the body of one of this savage band who in
the pursuit that was made after them was overtaken and killed should
produce lasting and terrific images in my fancy i never looked upon or
called up the image of a savage without shuddering

i knew that at this time some hostilities had been committed on the
frontier that a long course of injuries and encroachments had lately
exasperated the indian tribes that an implacable and exterminating war
was generally expected we imagined ourselves at an inaccessible
distance from the danger but i could not but remember that this
persuasion was formerly as strong as at present and that an expedition
which had once succeeded might possibly be attempted again here was
every token of enmity and bloodshed each prostrate figure was furnished
with a rifled musket and a leathern bag tied round his waist which
was probably stored with powder and ball

from these reflections the sense of my own danger was revived and
enforced but i likewise ruminated on the evils which might impend over
others i should no doubt be safe by remaining in this nook but might
not some means be pursued to warn others of their danger should they
leave this spot without notice of their approach being given to the
fearless and pacific tenants of the neighbouring district they might
commit in a few hours the most horrid and irreparable devastation

the alarm could only be diffused in one way could i not escape
unperceived and without alarming the sleepers from this cavern the
slumber of an indian is broken by the slightest noise but if all noise
be precluded it is commonly profound it was possible i conceived to
leave my present post to descend into the cave and issue forth without
the smallest signal their supine posture assured me that they were
asleep sleep usually comes at their bidding and if perchance they
should be wakeful at an unseasonable moment they always sit upon their
haunches and leaning their elbows on their knees consume the tedious
hours in smoking my peril would be great accidents which i could not
foresee and over which i had no command might occur to awaken some one
at the moment i was passing the fire should i pass in safety i might
issue forth into a wilderness of which i had no knowledge where i
might wander till i perished with famine or where my footsteps might be
noted and pursued and overtaken by these implacable foes these perils
were enormous and imminent but i likewise considered that i might be at
no great distance from the habitations of men and that my escape might
rescue them from the most dreadful calamities i determined to make this
dangerous experiment without delay

i came nearer to the aperture and had consequently a larger view of
this recess to my unspeakable dismay i now caught a glimpse of one
seated at the fire his back was turned towards me so that i could
distinctly survey his gigantic form and fantastic ornaments

my project was frustrated this one was probably commissioned to watch
and to awaken his companions when a due portion of sleep had been taken
that he would not be unfaithful or remiss in the performance of the part
assigned to him was easily predicted to pass him without exciting his
notice and the entrance could not otherwise be reached was impossible
once more i shrunk back and revolved with hopelessness and anguish the
necessity to which i was reduced

this interval of dreary foreboding did not last long some motion in him
that was seated by the fire attracted my notice i looked and beheld
him rise from his place and go forth from the cavern this unexpected
incident led my thoughts into a new channel could not some advantage be
taken of his absence could not this opportunity be seized for making my
escape he had left his gun and hatchet on the ground it was likely
therefore that he had not gone far and would speedily return might
not these weapons be seized and some provision be thus made against the
danger of meeting him without or of being pursued

before a resolution could be formed a new sound saluted my ear it was
a deep groan succeeded by sobs that seemed struggling for utterance but
were vehemently counteracted by the sufferer this low and bitter
lamentation apparently proceeded from some one within the cave it could
not be from one of this swarthy band it must then proceed from a
captive whom they had reserved for torment or servitude and who had
seized the opportunity afforded by the absence of him that watched to
give vent to his despair

i again thrust my head forward and beheld lying on the ground apart
from the rest and bound hand and foot a young girl her dress was the
coarse russet garb of the country and bespoke her to be some farmer's
daughter her features denoted the last degree of fear and anguish and
she moved her limbs in such a manner as showed that the ligatures by
which she was confined produced by their tightness the utmost degree
of pain

my wishes were now bent not only to preserve myself and to frustrate the
future attempts of these savages but likewise to relieve this miserable
victim this could only be done by escaping from the cavern and
returning with seasonable aid the sobs of the girl were likely to rouse
the sleepers my appearance before her would prompt her to testify her
surprise by some exclamation or shriek what could hence be predicted
but that the band would start on their feet and level their unerring
pieces at my head

i know not why i was insensible to these dangers my thirst was rendered
by these delays intolerable it took from me in some degree the power
of deliberation the murmurs which had drawn me hither continued still
to be heard some torrent or cascade could not be far distant from the
entrance of the cavern and it seemed as if one draught of clear water
was a luxury cheaply purchased by death itself this in addition to
considerations more disinterested and which i have already mentioned
impelled me forward

the girl's cheek rested on the hard rock and her eyes were dim with
tears as they were turned towards me however i hoped that my
movements would be noticed by her gradually and without abruptness this
expectation was fulfilled i had not advanced many steps before she
discovered me this moment was critical beyond all others in the course
of my existence my life was suspended as it were by a spider's
thread all rested on the effect which this discovery should make upon
this feeble victim

i was watchful of the first movement of her eye which should indicate a
consciousness of my presence i laboured by gestures and looks to
deter her from betraying her emotion my attention was at the same
time fixed upon the sleepers and an anxious glance was cast towards
the quarter whence the watchful savage might appear

i stooped and seized the musket and hatchet the space beyond the fire
was as i expected open to the air i issued forth with trembling
steps the sensations inspired by the dangers which environed me added
to my recent horrors and the influence of the moon which had now
gained the zenith and whose lustre dazzled my long-benighted senses
cannot be adequately described

for a minute i was unable to distinguish objects this confusion was
speedily corrected and i found myself on the verge of a steep craggy
eminences arose on all sides on the left hand was a space that offered
some footing and hither i turned a torrent was below me and this path
appeared to lead to it it quickly appeared in sight and all foreign
cares were for a time suspended

this water fell from the upper regions of the hill upon a flat
projecture which was continued on either side and on part of which i
was now standing the path was bounded on the left by an inaccessible
wall and on the right terminated at the distance of two or three feet
from the wall in a precipice the water was eight or ten paces distant
and no impediment seemed likely to rise between us i rushed forward
with speed

my progress was quickly checked close to the falling water seated on
the edge his back supported by the rock and his legs hanging over the
precipice i now beheld the savage who left the cave before me the
noise of the cascade and the improbability of interruption at least
from this quarter had made him inattentive to my motions

i paused along this verge lay the only road by which i could reach the
water and by which i could escape the passage was completely occupied
by this antagonist to advance towards him or to remain where i was
would produce the same effect i should in either case be detected he
was unarmed but his outcries would instantly summon his companions to
his aid i could not hope to overpower him and pass him in defiance of
his opposition but if this were effected pursuit would be instantly
commenced i was unacquainted with the way the way was unquestionably
difficult my strength was nearly annihilated i should be overtaken in
a moment or their deficiency in speed would be supplied by the accuracy
of their aim their bullets at least would reach me

there was one method of removing this impediment the piece which i held
in my hand was cocked there could be no doubt that it was loaded a
precaution of this kind would never be omitted by a warrior of this hue
at a greater distance than this i should not fear to reach the mark
should i not discharge it and at the same moment rush forward to
secure the road which my adversary's death would open to me

perhaps you will conceive a purpose like this to have argued a
sanguinary and murderous disposition let it be remembered however
that i entertained no doubts about the hostile designs of these men
this was sufficiently indicated by their arms their guise and the
captive who attended them let the fate of my parents be likewise
remembered i was not certain but that these very men were the assassins
of my family and were those who had reduced me and my sisters to the
condition of orphans and dependants no words can describe the torments
of my thirst relief to these torments and safety to my life were
within view how could i hesitate

yet i did hesitate my aversion to bloodshed was not to be subdued but
by the direst necessity i knew indeed that the discharge of a musket
would only alarm the enemies who remained behind but i had another and
a better weapon in my grasp i could rive the head of my adversary and
cast him headlong without any noise which should be heard into the
cavern

still i was willing to withdraw to re-enter the cave and take shelter
in the darksome recesses from which i had emerged here i might remain
unsuspected till these detested guests should depart the hazards
attending my re-entrance were to be boldly encountered and the torments
of unsatisfied thirst were to be patiently endured rather than imbrue
my hands in the blood of my fellowmen but this expedient would be
ineffectual if my retreat should be observed by this savage of that i
was bound to be incontestably assured i retreated therefore but kept
my eye fixed at the same time upon the enemy

some ill fate decreed that i should not retreat unobserved scarcely had
i withdrawn three paces when he started from his seat and turning
towards me walked with a quick pace the shadow of the rock and the
improbability of meeting an enemy here concealed me for a moment from
his observation i stood still the slightest motion would have
attracted his notice at present the narrow space engaged all his
vigilance cautious footsteps and attention to the path were
indispensable to his safety the respite was momentary and i employed
it in my own defence

how otherwise could i act the danger that impended aimed at nothing
less than my life to take the life of another was the only method of
averting it the means were in my hand and they were used in an
extremity like this my muscles would have acted almost in defiance of
my will

the stroke was quick as lightning and the wound mortal and deep he had
not time to descry the author of his fate but sinking on the path
expired without a groan the hatchet buried itself in his breast and
rolled with him to the bottom of the precipice

never before had i taken the life of a human creature on this head i
had indeed entertained somewhat of religious scruples these scruples
did not forbid me to defend myself but they made me cautious and
reluctant to decide though they could not withhold my hand when urged
by a necessity like this they were sufficient to make me look back upon
the deed with remorse and dismay

i did not escape all compunction in the present instance but the tumult
of my feelings was quickly allayed to quench my thirst was a
consideration by which all others were supplanted i approached the
torrent and not only drank copiously but laved my head neck and
arms in this delicious element




chapter xviii


never was any delight worthy of comparison with the raptures which i
then experienced life that was rapidly ebbing appeared to return upon
me with redoubled violence my languors my excruciating heat vanished
in a moment and i felt prepared to undergo the labours of hercules
having fully supplied the demands of nature in this respect i returned
to reflection on the circumstances of my situation the path winding
round the hill was now free from all impediments what remained but to
precipitate my flight i might speedily place myself beyond all danger
i might gain some hospitable shelter where my fatigues might be
repaired by repose and my wounds be cured i might likewise impart to
my protectors seasonable information of the enemies who meditated their
destruction

i thought upon the condition of the hapless girl whom i had left in the
power of the savages was it impossible to rescue her might i not
relieve her from her bonds and make her the companion of my flight the
exploit was perilous but not impracticable there was something
dastardly and ignominious in withdrawing from the danger and leaving a
helpless being exposed to it a single minute might suffice to snatch
her from death or captivity the parents might deserve that i should
hazard or even sacrifice my life in the cause of their child

after some fluctuation i determined to return to the cavern and attempt
the rescue of the girl the success of this project depended on the
continuance of their sleep it was proper to approach with wariness and
to heed the smallest token which might bespeak their condition i crept
along the path bending my ear forward to catch any sound that might
arise i heard nothing but the half-stifled sobs of the girl

i entered with the slowest and most anxious circumspection every thing
was found in its pristine state the girl noticed my entrance with a
mixture of terror and joy my gestures and looks enjoined upon her
silence i stooped down and taking another hatchet cut asunder the
deer-skin thongs by which her wrists and ankles were tied i then made
signs for her to rise and follow me she willingly complied with my
directions but her benumbed joints and lacerated sinews refused to
support her there was no time to be lost i therefore lifted her in my
arms and feeble and tottering as i was proceeded with this burden
along the perilous steep and over a most rugged-path

i hoped that some exertion would enable her to retrieve the use of her
limbs i set her therefore on her feet exhorting her to walk as well
as she was able and promising her my occasional assistance the poor
girl was not deficient in zeal and presently moved along with light and
quick steps we speedily reached the bottom of the hill

no fancy can conceive a scene more wild and desolate than that which now
presented itself the soil was nearly covered with sharp fragments of
stone between these sprung brambles and creeping vines whose twigs
crossing and intertwining with each other added to the roughness below
made the passage infinitely toilsome scattered over this space were
single cedars with their ragged spines and wreaths of moss and copses
of dwarf oaks which were only new emblems of sterility

i was wholly unacquainted with the scene before me no marks of
habitation or culture no traces of the footsteps of men were
discernible i scarcely knew in what region of the globe i was placed i
had come hither by means so inexplicable as to leave it equally in doubt
whether i was separated from my paternal abode by a river or an ocean

i made inquiries of my companion but she was unable to talk coherently
she answered my questions with weeping and sobs and entreaties to fly
from the scene of her distress i collected from her at length that
her father's house had been attacked on the preceding evening and all
the family but herself destroyed since this disaster she had walked
very fast and a great way but knew not how far or in what direction

in a wilderness like this my only hope was to light upon obscure paths
made by cattle meanwhile i endeavoured to adhere to one line and to
burst through the vexatious obstacles which encumbered our way the
ground was concealed by the bushes and we were perplexed and fatigued
by a continual succession of hollows and prominences at one moment we
were nearly thrown headlong into a pit at another we struck our feet
against the angles of stones the branches of the oak rebounded in our
faces or entangled our legs and the unseen thorns inflicted on us a
thousand wounds

i was obliged in these arduous circumstances to support not only
myself but my companion her strength was overpowered by her evening
journey and the terror of being overtaken incessantly harassed her

sometimes we lighted upon tracks which afforded us an easier footing and
inspired us with courage to proceed these for a time terminated at a
brook or in a bog and we were once more compelled to go forward at
random one of these tracks insensibly became more beaten and at
length exhibited the traces of wheels to this i adhered confident
that it would finally conduct us to a dwelling

on either side the undergrowth of shrubs and brambles continued as
before sometimes small spaces were observed which had lately been
cleared by fire at length a vacant space of larger dimensions than had
hitherto occurred presented itself to my view it was a field of some
acres that had apparently been upturned by the hoe at the corner of
this field was a small house

my heart leaped with joy at this sight i hastened towards it in the
hope that my uncertainties and toils and dangers were now drawing to
a close this dwelling was suited to the poverty and desolation which
surrounded it it consisted of a few unhewn logs laid upon each other
to the height of eight or ten feet including a quadrangular space of
similar dimensions and covered by a thatch there was no window light
being sufficiently admitted into the crevices between the logs these
had formerly been loosely plastered with clay but air and rain had
crumbled and washed the greater part of this rude cement away somewhat
like a chimney built of half-burnt bricks was perceived at one corner
the door was fastened by a leathern thong tied to a peg

all within was silence and darkness i knocked at the door and called
but no one moved or answered the tenant whoever he was was absent
his leave could not be obtained and i therefore entered without it
the autumn had made some progress and the air was frosty and sharp my
mind and muscles had been of late so strenuously occupied that the cold
had not been felt the cessation of exercise however quickly restored
my sensibility in this respect but the unhappy girl complained of being
half frozen

fire therefore was the first object of my search happily some embers
were found upon the hearth together with potato-stalks and dry chips
of these with much difficulty i kindled a fire by which some warmth
was imparted to our shivering limbs the light enabled me as i sat upon
the ground to survey the interior of this mansion three saplings
stripped of their branches and bound together at their ends by twigs
formed a kind of bedstead which was raised from the ground by four
stones ropes stretched across these and covered by a blanket
constituted the bed a board of which one end rested on the bedstead
and the other was thrust between the logs that composed the wall
sustained the stale fragments of a rye-loaf and a cedar bucket kept
entire by withes instead of hoops in the bucket was a little water
full of droppings from the roof drowned insects and sand a basket or
two neatly made and a hoe with a stake thrust into it by way of
handle made up all the furniture that was visible

next to cold hunger was the most urgent necessity by which we were now
pressed this was no time to give ear to scruples we therefore
unceremoniously divided the bread and water between us i had now
leisure to bestow some regards upon the future

these remnants of fire and food convinced me that this dwelling was
usually inhabited and that it had lately been deserted some engagement
had probably carried the tenant abroad his absence might be terminated
in a few minutes or might endure through the night on his return i
questioned not my power to appease any indignation he might feel at the
liberties which i had taken i was willing to suppose him one who would
readily afford us all the information and succour that we needed

if he should not return till sunrise i meant to resume my journey by
the comfortable meal we had made and the repose of a few hours we
should be considerably invigorated and refreshed and the road would
lead us to some more hospitable tenement

my thoughts were too tumultuous and my situation too precarious to
allow me to sleep the girl on the contrary soon sank into a sweet
oblivion of all her cares she laid herself by my advice upon the bed
and left me to ruminate without interruption

i was not wholly free from the apprehension of danger what influence
this boisterous and solitary life might have upon the temper of the
being who inhabited this hut i could not predict how soon the indians
might awake and what path they would pursue i was equally unable to
guess it was by no means impossible that they might tread upon my
footsteps and knock in a few minutes at the door of this cottage it
behooved me to make all the preparations in my power against untoward
incidents

i had not parted with the gun which i had first seized in the cavern
nor with the hatchet which i had afterwards used to cut the bands of the
girl these were at once my trophies and my means of defence which it
had been rash and absurd to have relinquished my present reliance was
placed upon these

i now for the first time examined the prize that i had made other
considerations had prevented me till now from examining the structure
of the piece but i could not but observe that it had two barrels and
was lighter and smaller than an ordinary musket the light of the fire
now enabled me to inspect it with more accuracy

scarcely had i fixed my eyes upon the stock when i perceived marks that
were familiar to my apprehension shape ornaments and ciphers were
evidently the same with those of a piece which i had frequently handled
the marks were of a kind which could not be mistaken this piece was
mine and when i left my uncle's house it was deposited as i
believed in the closet of my chamber

thou wilt easily conceive the inference which this circumstance
suggested my hairs rose and my teeth chattered with horror my whole
frame was petrified and i paced to and fro hurried from the chimney to
the door and from the door to the chimney with the misguided fury of a
maniac

i needed no proof of my calamity more incontestable than this my uncle
and my sisters had been murdered the dwelling had been pillaged and
this had been a part of the plunder defenceless and asleep they were
assailed by these inexorable enemies and i who ought to have been
their protector and champion was removed to an immeasurable distance
and was disabled by some accursed chance from affording them the
succour which they needed

for a time i doubted whether i had not witnessed and shared this
catastrophe i had no memory of the circumstances that preceded my
awaking in the pit had not the cause of my being cast into this abyss
some connection with the ruin of my family had i not been dragged
hither by these savages and reduced by their malice to that breathless
and insensible condition was i born to a malignant destiny never tired
of persecuting thus had my parents and their infant offspring perished
and thus completed was the fate of all those to whom my affections
cleaved and whom the first disaster had spared

hitherto the death of the savage whom i had dispatched with my hatchet
had not been remembered without some remorse now my emotions were
totally changed i was somewhat comforted in thinking that thus much of
necessary vengeance had been executed new and more vehement regrets
were excited by reflecting on the forbearance i had practised when so
much was in my power all the miscreants had been at my mercy and a
bloody retribution might with safety and ease have been inflicted on
their prostrate bodies

it was now too late what of consolation or of hope remained to me to
return to my ancient dwelling now polluted with blood or perhaps
nothing but a smoking ruin was abhorred life connected with the
remembrance of my misfortunes was detestable i was no longer anxious
for flight no change of the scene but that which terminated all
consciousness could i endure to think of

amidst these gloomy meditations the idea was suddenly suggested of
returning with the utmost expedition to the cavern it was possible
that the assassins were still asleep he who was appointed to watch and
to make in due season the signal for resuming their march was forever
silent without this signal it was not unlikely that they would sleep
till dawn of day but if they should be roused they might be overtaken
or met and by choosing a proper station two victims might at least
fall the ultimate event to myself would surely be fatal but my own
death was an object of desire rather than of dread to die thus
speedily and after some atonement was made for those who had already
been slain was sweet

the way to the mountain was difficult and tedious but the ridge was
distinctly seen from the door of the cottage and i trusted that
auspicious chance would lead me to that part of it where my prey was to
be found i snatched up the gun and tomahawk in a transport of
eagerness on examining the former i found that both barrels were
deeply loaded

this piece was of extraordinary workmanship it was the legacy of an
english officer who died in bengal to sarsefield it was constructed
for the purposes not of sport but of war the artist had made it a
congeries of tubes and springs by which every purpose of protection and
offence was effectually served a dagger's blade was attached to it
capable of being fixed at the end and of answering the destructive
purpose of a bayonet on his departure from solesbury my friend left
it as a pledge of his affection in my possession hitherto i had
chiefly employed it in shooting at a mark in order to improve my sight
now was i to profit by the gift in a different way

thus armed i prepared to sally forth on my adventurous expedition
sober views might have speedily succeeded to the present tempest of my
passions i might have gradually discovered the romantic and criminal
temerity of my project the folly of revenge and the duty of preserving
my life for the benefit of mankind i might have suspected the propriety
of my conclusion and have admitted some doubts as to the catastrophe
which i imagined to have befallen my uncle and sisters i might at
least have consented to ascertain their condition with my own eyes and
for this end have returned to the cottage and have patiently waited
till the morning light should permit me to resume my journey

this conduct was precluded by a new incident before i opened the door i
looked through a crevice of the wall and perceived three human figures
at the farther end of the field they approached the house though
indistinctly seen something in their port persuaded me that these were
the indians from whom i had lately parted i was startled but not
dismayed my thirst of vengeance was still powerful and i believed that
the moment of its gratification was hastening in a short time they
would arrive and enter the house in what manner should they be
received

i studied not my own security it was the scope of my wishes to kill the
whole number of my foes but that being done i was indifferent to the
consequences i desired not to live to relate or to exult in the deed

to go forth was perilous and useless all that remained was to sit upon
the ground opposite the door and fire at each as he entered in the
hasty survey i had taken of this apartment one object had been
overlooked or imperfectly noticed close to the chimney was an
aperture formed by a cavity partly in the wall and in the ground it
was the entrance of an oven which resembled on the outside a mound of
earth and which was filled with dry stalks of potatoes and other
rubbish

into this it was possible to thrust my body a sort of screen might be
formed of the brushwood and more deliberate and effectual execution be
done upon the enemy i weighed not the disadvantages of this scheme but
precipitately threw myself into this cavity i discovered in an
instant that it was totally unfit for my purpose but it was too late
to repair my miscarriage

this wall of the hovel was placed near the verge of a sand-bank the
oven was erected on the very brink this bank being of a loose and
mutable soil could not sustain my weight it sunk and i sunk along
with it the height of the bank was three or four feet so that though
disconcerted and embarrassed i received no injury i still grasped my
gun and resumed my feet in a moment

what was now to be done the bank screened me from the view of the
savages the thicket was hard by and if i were eager to escape the
way was obvious and sure but though single though enfeebled by toil
by abstinence and by disease and though so much exceeded in number and
strength by my foes i was determined to await and provoke the contest

in addition to the desperate impulse of passion i was swayed by
thoughts of the danger which beset the sleeping girl and from which my
flight would leave her without protection how strange is the destiny
that governs mankind the consequence of shrouding myself in this cavity
had not been foreseen it was an expedient which courage and not
cowardice suggested and yet it was the only expedient by which flight
had been rendered practicable to have issued from the door would only
have been to confront and not to elude the danger

the first impulse prompted me to re-enter the cottage by this avenue
but this could not be done with certainty and expedition what then
remained while i deliberated the men approached and after a moment's
hesitation entered the house the door being partly open

the fire on the hearth enabled them to survey the room one of them
uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise this was easily interpreted
they had noticed the girl who had lately been their captive lying asleep
on the blanket their astonishment at finding her here and in this
condition may be easily conceived

i now reflected that i might place myself without being observed near
the entrance at an angle of the building and shoot at each as he
successively came forth i perceived that the bank conformed to two
sides of the house and that i might gain a view of the front and of the
entrance without exposing myself to observation

i lost no time in gaining this station the bank was as high as my
breast it was easy therefore to crouch beneath it to bring my eye
close to the verge and laying my gun upon the top of it among the
grass with its muzzles pointed to the door patiently to wait their
forthcoming

my eye and my ear were equally attentive to what was passing a low and
muttering conversation was maintained in the house presently i heard a
heavy stroke descend i shuddered and my blood ran cold at the sound i
entertained no doubt but that it was the stroke of a hatchet on the head
or breast of the helpless sleeper

it was followed by a loud shriek the continuance of these shrieks
proved that the stroke had not been instantly fatal i waited to hear it
repeated but the sounds that now arose were like those produced by
dragging somewhat along the ground the shrieks meanwhile were
incessant and piteous my heart faltered and i saw that mighty efforts
must be made to preserve my joints and my nerves steadfast all depended
on the strenuous exertions and the fortunate dexterity of a moment

one now approached the door and came forth dragging the girl whom he
held by the hair after him what hindered me from shooting at his first
appearance i know not this had been my previous resolution my hand
touched the trigger and as he moved the piece was levelled at his
right ear perhaps the momentous consequences of my failure made me wait
till his ceasing to move might render my aim more sure

having dragged the girl still piteously shrieking to the distance of
ten feet from the house he threw her from him with violence she fell
upon the ground and observing him level his piece at her breast
renewed her supplications in a still more piercing tone little did the
forlorn wretch think that her deliverance was certain and near i
rebuked myself for having thus long delayed i fired and my enemy sunk
upon the ground without a struggle

thus far had success attended me in this unequal contest the next shot
would leave me nearly powerless if that however proved as unerring as
the first the chances of defeat were lessened the savages within
knowing the intentions of their associate with regard to the captive
girl would probably mistake the report which they heard for that of his
piece their mistake however would speedily give place to doubts and
they would rush forth to ascertain the truth it behooved me to provide
a similar reception for him that next appeared

it was as i expected scarcely was my eye again fixed upon the entrance
when a tawny and terrific visage was stretched fearfully forth it was
the signal of his fate his glances cast wildly and swiftly round
lighted upon me and on the fatal instrument which was pointed at his
forehead his muscles were at once exerted to withdraw his head and to
vociferate a warning to his fellow but his movement was too slow the
ball entered above his ear he tumbled headlong to the ground bereaved
of sensation though not of life and had power only to struggle and
mutter




chapter xix


think not that i relate these things with exultation or tranquillity
all my education and the habits of my life tended to unfit me for a
contest and a scene like this but i was not governed by the soul which
usually regulates my conduct i had imbibed from the unparalleled
events which had lately happened a spirit vengeful unrelenting and
ferocious

there was now an interval for flight throwing my weapons away i might
gain the thicket in a moment i had no ammunition nor would time be
afforded me to reload my piece my antagonist would render my poniard
and my speed of no use to me should he miss me as i fled the girl
would remain to expiate by her agonies and death the fate of his
companions

these thoughts passed through my mind in a shorter time than is demanded
to express them they yielded to an expedient suggested by the sight of
the gun that had been raised to destroy the girl and which now lay upon
the ground i am not large of bone but am not deficient in agility and
strength all that remained to me of these qualities was now exerted
and dropping my own piece i leaped upon the bank and flew to seize my
prize

it was not till i snatched it from the ground that the propriety of
regaining my former post rushed upon my apprehension he that was still
posted in the hovel would mark me through the seams of the wall and
render my destruction sure i once more ran towards the bank with the
intention to throw myself below it all this was performed in an
instant but my vigilant foe was aware of his advantage and fired
through an opening between the logs the bullet grazed my cheek and
produced a benumbing sensation that made me instantly fall to the earth
though bereaved of strength and fraught with the belief that i had
received a mortal wound my caution was not remitted i loosened not my
grasp of the gun and the posture into which i accidentally fell enabled
me to keep an eye upon the house and a hand upon the trigger perceiving
my condition the savage rushed from his covert in order to complete his
work but at three steps from the threshold he received my bullet in his
breast the uplifted tomahawk fell from his hand and uttering a loud
shriek he fell upon the body of his companion his cries struck upon my
heart and i wished that his better fortune had cast this evil from him
upon me

thus i have told thee a bloody and disastrous tale when thou reflectest
on the mildness of my habits my antipathy to scenes of violence and
bloodshed my unacquaintance with the use of fire-arms and the motives
of a soldier thou wilt scarcely allow credit to my story that one
rushing into these dangers unfurnished with stratagems or weapons
disheartened and enfeebled by hardships and pain should subdue four
antagonists trained from their infancy to the artifices and exertions of
indian warfare will seem the vision of fancy rather than the lesson of
truth

i lifted my head from the ground and pondered upon this scene the
magnitude of this exploit made me question its reality by attending to
my own sensations i discovered that i had received no wound or at
least none of which there was reason to complain the blood flowed
plentifully from my cheek but the injury was superficial it was
otherwise with my antagonists the last that had fallen now ceased to
groan their huge limbs inured to combat and war-worn were useless
to their own defence and to the injury of others

the destruction that i witnessed was vast three beings full of energy
and heroism endowed with minds strenuous and lofty poured out their
lives before me i was the instrument of their destruction this scene
of carnage and blood was laid by me to this havoc and horror was i led
by such rapid footsteps

my anguish was mingled with astonishment in spite of the force and
uniformity with which my senses were impressed by external objects the
transition i had undergone was so wild and inexplicable all that i had
performed all that i had witnessed since my egress from the pit were
so contradictory to precedent events that i still clung to the belief
that my thoughts were confused by delirium from these reveries i was at
length recalled by the groans of the girl who lay near me on the
ground

i went to her and endeavoured to console her i found that while lying
in the bed she had received a blow upon the side which was still
productive of acute pain she was unable to rise or to walk and it was
plain that one or more of her ribs had been fractured by the blow

i knew not what means to devise for our mutual relief it was possible
that the nearest dwelling was many leagues distant i knew not in what
direction to go in order to find it and my strength would not suffice
to carry my wounded companion thither in my arms there was no expedient
but to remain in this field of blood till the morning

i had scarcely formed this resolution before the report of a musket was
heard at a small distance at the same moment i distinctly heard the
whistling of a bullet near me i now remembered that of the five
indians whom i saw in the cavern i was acquainted with the destiny only
of four the fifth might be still alive and fortune might reserve for
him the task of avenging his companions his steps might now be tending
hither in search of them

the musket belonging to him who was shot upon the threshold was still
charged it was discreet to make all the provision in my power against
danger i possessed myself of this gun and seating myself on the
ground looked carefully on all sides to descry the approach of the
enemy i listened with breathless eagerness

presently voices were heard they ascended from that part of the thicket
from which my view was intercepted by the cottage these voices had
something in them that bespoke them to belong to friends and countrymen
as yet i was unable to distinguish words

presently my eye was attracted to one quarter by a sound as of feet
trampling down bushes several heads were seen moving in succession and
at length the whole person was conspicuous one after another leaped
over a kind of mound which bordered the field and made towards the spot
where i sat this band was composed of ten or twelve persons with each
a gun upon his shoulder their guise the moment it was perceived
dissipated all my apprehensions

they came within the distance of a few paces before they discovered me
one stopped and bespeaking the attention of his followers called to
know who was there i answered that i was a friend who entreated their
assistance i shall not paint their astonishment when on coming nearer
they beheld me surrounded by the arms and dead bodies of my enemies

i sat upon the ground supporting my head with my left hand and resting
on my knee the stock of a heavy musket my countenance was wan and
haggard my neck and bosom were dyed in blood and my limbs almost
stripped by the brambles of their slender covering were lacerated by a
thousand wounds three savages two of whom were steeped in gore lay at
a small distance with the traces of recent life on their visages hard
by was the girl venting her anguish in the deepest groans and
entreating relief from the new-comers

one of the company on approaching the girl betrayed the utmost
perturbation good god he cried is this a dream can it be you
speak

ah my father my father answered she it is i indeed

the company attracted by this dialogue crowded round the girl whom
her father clasping in his arms lifted from the ground and pressed
in a transport of joy to his breast this delight was succeeded by
solicitude respecting her condition she could only answer his inquiries
by complaining that her side was bruised to pieces how came you
here who hurt you where did the indians carry you were
questions to which she could make no reply but by sobs and plaints

my own calamities were forgotten in contemplating the fondness and
compassion of the man for his child i derived new joy from reflecting
that i had not abandoned her and that she owed her preservation to my
efforts the inquiries which the girl was unable to answer were now put
to me every one interrogated me who i was whence i had come and what
had given rise to this bloody contest

i was not willing to expatiate on my story the spirit which had
hitherto sustained me began now to subside my strength ebbed away with
my blood tremors lassitude and deadly cold invaded me and i fainted
on the ground

such is the capricious constitution of the human mind while dangers
were at hand while my life was to be preserved only by zeal and
vigilance and courage i was not wanting to myself had my perils
continued or even multiplied no doubt my energies would have kept
equal pace with them but the moment that i was encompassed by
protectors and placed in security i grew powerless and faint my
weakness was proportioned to the duration and intensity of my previous
efforts and the swoon into which i now sunk was no doubt mistaken by
the spectators for death

on recovering from this swoon my sensations were not unlike those which
i had experienced on awaking in the pit for a moment a mistiness
involved every object and i was able to distinguish nothing my sight
by rapid degrees was restored my painful dizziness was banished and i
surveyed the scene before me with anxiety and wonder

i found myself stretched upon the ground i perceived the cottage and
the neighbouring thicket illuminated by a declining moon my head
rested upon something which on turning to examine i found to be one
of the slain indians the other two remained upon the earth at a small
distance and in the attitudes in which they had fallen their arms the
wounded girl and the troop who were near me when i fainted were gone

my head had reposed upon the breast of him whom i had shot in this part
of his body the blood had ceased to ooze from the wound but my
dishevelled locks were matted and steeped in that gore which had
overflowed and choked up the orifice i started from this detestable
pillow and regained my feet

i did not suddenly recall what had lately passed or comprehend the
nature of my situation at length however late events were
recollected

that i should be abandoned in this forlorn state by these men seemed to
argue a degree of cowardice or cruelty of which i should have thought
them incapable presently however i reflected that appearances might
have easily misled them into a belief of my death on this supposition
to have carried me away or to have stayed beside me would be useless
other enemies might be abroad or their families now that their fears
were somewhat tranquillized might require their presence and
protection

i went into the cottage the fire still burned and afforded me a genial
warmth i sat before it and began to ruminate on the state to which i
was reduced and on the measures i should next pursue daylight could
not be very distant should i remain in this hovel till the morning or
immediately resume my journey i was feeble indeed but by remaining
here should i not increase my feebleness the sooner i should gain some
human habitation the better whereas watchfulness and hunger would
render me at each minute less able to proceed than on the former

this spot might be visited on the next day but this was involved in
uncertainty the visitants should any come would come merely to
examine and bury the dead and bring with them neither the clothing nor
the food which my necessities demanded the road was sufficiently
discernible and would unavoidably conduct me to some dwelling i
determined therefore to set out without delay even in this state i
was not unmindful that my safety might require the precaution of being
armed besides the fusil which had been given me by sarsefield and
which i had so unexpectedly recovered had lost none of its value in my
eyes i hoped that it had escaped the search of the troop who had been
here and still lay below the bank in the spot where i had dropped it

in this hope i was not deceived it was found i possessed myself of the
powder and shot belonging to one of the savages and loaded it thus
equipped for defence i regained the road and proceeded with alacrity
on my way for the wound in my cheek nature had provided a styptic but
the soreness was extreme and i thought of no remedy but water with
which i might wash away the blood my thirst likewise incommoded me and
i looked with eagerness for the traces of a spring in a soil like that
of the wilderness around me nothing was less to be expected than to
light upon water in this respect however my destiny was propitious i
quickly perceived water in the ruts it trickled hither from the thicket
on one side and pursuing it among the bushes i reached the bubbling
source though scanty and brackish it afforded me unspeakable
refreshment

thou wilt think perhaps that my perils were now at an end that the
blood i had already shed was sufficient for my safety i fervently hoped
that no new exigence would occur compelling me to use the arms that i
bore in my own defence i formed a sort of resolution to shun the
contest with a new enemy almost at the expense of my own life i was
satiated and gorged with slaughter and thought upon a new act of
destruction with abhorrence and loathing

but though i dreaded to encounter a new enemy i was sensible that an
enemy might possibly be at hand i had moved forward with caution and
my sight and hearing were attentive to the slightest tokens other
troops besides that which i encountered might be hovering near and of
that troop i remembered that one at least had survived

the gratification which the spring had afforded me was so great that i
was in no haste to depart i lay upon a rock which chanced to be shaded
by a tree behind me from this post i could overlook the road to some
distance and at the same time be shaded from the observation of
others

my eye was now caught by movements which appeared like those of a beast
in different circumstances i should have instantly supposed it to be a
wolf or panther or bear now my suspicions were alive on a different
account and my startled fancy figured to itself nothing but a human
adversary

a thicket was on either side of the road that opposite to my station
was discontinued at a small distance by the cultivated field the road
continued along this field bounded by the thicket on the one side and
the open space on the other to this space the being who was now
described was cautiously approaching

he moved upon all fours and presently came near enough to be
distinguished his disfigured limbs pendants from his ears and nose
and his shorn locks were indubitable indications of a savage
occasionally he reared himself above the bushes and scanned with
suspicious vigilance the cottage and the space surrounding it then he
stooped and crept along as before

i was at no loss to interpret these appearances this was my surviving
enemy he was unacquainted with the fate of his associates and was now
approaching the theatre of carnage to ascertain their fate

once more was the advantage afforded me from this spot might unerring
aim be taken and the last of this hostile troop be made to share the
fate of the rest should i fire or suffer him to pass in safety

my abhorrence of bloodshed was not abated but i had not foreseen this
occurrence my success hitherto had seemed to depend upon a combination
of fortunate incidents which could not be expected again to take place
but now was i invested with the same power the mark was near nothing
obstructed or delayed i incurred no danger and the event was certain

why should he be suffered to live he came hither to murder and despoil
my friends this work he has no doubt performed nay has he not borne
his part in the destruction of my uncle and my sisters he will live
only to pursue the same sanguinary trade to drink the blood and exult
in the laments of his unhappy foes and of my own brethren fate has
reserved him for a bloody and violent death for how long a time soever
it may be deferred it is thus that his career will inevitably
terminate

should he be spared he will still roam in the wilderness and i may
again be fated to encounter him then our mutual situation may be widely
different and the advantage i now possess may be his

while hastily revolving these thoughts i was thoroughly aware that one
event might take place which would render all deliberation useless
should he spy me where i lay my fluctuations must end my safety would
indispensably require me to shoot this persuasion made me keep a
steadfast eye upon his motions and be prepared to anticipate his
assault

it now most seasonably occurred to me that one essential duty remained
to be performed one operation without which fire-arms are useless had
been unaccountably omitted my piece was uncocked i did not reflect
that in moving the spring a sound would necessarily be produced
sufficient to alarm him but i knew that the chances of escaping his
notice should i be perfectly mute and still were extremely slender
and that in such a case his movements would be quicker than the light
it behooved me therefore to repair my omission

the sound struck him with alarm he turned and darted at me an inquiring
glance i saw that forbearance was no longer in my power but my heart
sunk while i complied with what may surely be deemed an indispensable
necessity this faltering perhaps it was that made me swerve somewhat
from the fatal line he was disabled by the wound but not killed

he lost all power of resistance and was therefore no longer to be
dreaded he rolled upon the ground uttering doleful shrieks and
throwing his limbs into those contortions which bespeak the keenest
agonies to which ill-fated man is subject horror and compassion and
remorse were mingled into one sentiment and took possession of my
heart to shut out this spectacle i withdrew from the spot but i
stopped before i had moved beyond hearing of his cries

the impulse that drove me from the scene was pusillanimous and cowardly
the past however deplorable could not be recalled but could not i
afford some relief to this wretch could not i at least bring his pangs
to a speedy close thus he might continue writhing and calling upon
death for hours why should his miseries be uselessly prolonged

there was but one way to end them to kill him outright was the dictate
of compassion and of duty i hastily returned and once more levelled my
piece at his head it was a loathsome obligation and was performed with
unconquerable reluctance thus to assault and to mangle the body of an
enemy already prostrate and powerless was an act worthy of abhorrence
yet it was in this case prescribed by pity

my faltering hand rendered this second bullet ineffectual one
expedient still more detestable remained having gone thus far it
would have been inhuman to stop short his heart might easily be pierced
by the bayonet and his struggles would cease

this task of cruel lenity was at length finished i dropped the weapon
and threw myself on the ground overpowered by the horrors of this
scene such are the deeds which perverse nature compels thousands of
rational beings to perform and to witness such is the spectacle
endlessly prolonged and diversified which is exhibited in every field
of battle of which habit and example the temptations of gain and the
illusions of honour will make us not reluctant or indifferent but
zealous and delighted actors and beholders

thus by a series of events impossible to be computed or foreseen was
the destruction of a band selected from their fellows for an arduous
enterprise distinguished by prowess and skill and equally armed
against surprise and force completed by the hand of a boy uninured to
hostility unprovided with arms precipitate and timorous i have noted
men who seemed born for no end but by their achievements to belie
experience and baffle foresight and outstrip belief would to god that
i had not deserved to be numbered among these but what power was it
that called me from the sleep of death just in time to escape the
merciless knife of this enemy had my swoon continued till he had
reached the spot he would have effectuated my death by new wounds and
torn away the skin from my brows such are the subtle threads on which
hang the fate of man and of the universe

while engaged in these reflections i perceived that the moonlight had
begun to fade before that of the sun a dusky and reddish hue spread
itself over the east cheered by this appearance i once more resumed my
feet and the road i left the savage where he lay but made prize of
his tomahawk i had left my own in the cavern and this weapon added
little to my burden prompted by some freak of fancy i stuck his musket
in the ground and left it standing upright in the middle of the road




chapter xx


i moved forward with as quick a pace as my feeble limbs would permit i
did not allow myself to meditate the great object of my wishes was a
dwelling where food and repose might be procured i looked earnestly
forward and on each side in search of some token of human residence
but the spots of cultivation the well-pole the worm fence
and the hayrick were nowhere to be seen i did not even meet with a
wild hog or a bewildered cow the path was narrow and on either side
was a trackless wilderness on the right and left were the waving
lines of mountainous ridges which had no peculiarity enabling me to
ascertain whether i had ever before seen them

at length i noticed that the tracks of wheels had disappeared from the
path that i was treading that it became more narrow and exhibited
fewer marks of being frequented these appearances were discouraging i
now suspected that i had taken a wrong direction and instead of
approaching was receding from the habitation of men

it was wisest however to proceed the road could not but have some
origin as well as end some hours passed away in this uncertainty the
sun rose and by noonday i seemed to be farther than ever from the end
of my toils the path was more obscure and the wilderness more rugged
thirst more incommoded me than hunger but relief was seasonably
afforded by the brooks that flowed across the path

coming to one of these and having slaked my thirst i sat down upon the
bank to reflect on my situation the circuity of the path had
frequently been noticed and i began to suspect that though i had
travelled long i had not moved far from the spot where i had commenced
my pilgrimage

turning my eyes on all sides i noticed a sort of pool formed by the
rivulet at a few paces distant from the road in approaching and
inspecting it i observed the footsteps of cattle who had retired by a
path that seemed much beaten i likewise noticed a cedar bucket broken
and old lying on the margin these tokens revived my drooping spirits
arid i betook myself to this new track it was intricate but at
length led up a steep the summit of which was of better soil than that
of which the flats consisted a clover-field and several
apple-trees sure attendants of man were now discovered from this
space i entered a corn-field and at length to my inexpressible joy
caught a glimpse of a house

this dwelling was far different from that i had lately left it was as
small and as low but its walls consisted of boards a window of four
panes admitted the light and a chimney of brick well burnt and neatly
arranged peeped over the roof as i approached i heard the voice of
children and the hum of a spinning-wheel

i cannot make thee conceive the delight which was afforded me by all
these tokens i now found myself indeed among beings like myself and
from whom hospitable entertainment might be confidently expected i
compassed the house and made my appearance at the door

a good woman busy at her wheel with two children playing on the ground
before her were the objects that now presented themselves the
uncouthness of my garb my wild and weatherworn appearance my fusil and
tomahawk could not but startle them the woman stopped her wheel and
gazed as if a spectre had started into view

i was somewhat aware of these consequences and endeavoured to elude
them by assuming an air of supplication and humility i told her that i
was a traveller who had unfortunately lost his way and had rambled in
this wild till nearly famished for want i entreated her to give me some
food any thing however scanty or coarse would be acceptable

after some pause she desired me though not without some marks of fear
to walk in she placed before me some brown bread and milk she eyed me
while i eagerly devoured this morsel it was indeed more delicious
than any i had ever tasted at length she broke silence and expressed
her astonishment and commiseration at my seemingly-forlorn state adding
that perhaps i was the man whom the men were looking after who had been
there some hours before

my curiosity was roused by this intimation in answer to my
interrogations she said that three persons had lately stopped to
inquire if her husband had not met within the last three days a person
of whom their description seemed pretty much to suit my person and
dress he was tall slender wore nothing but shirt and trousers and
was wounded on the cheek

what i asked did they state the rank or condition of the person to
be

he lived in solesbury he was supposed to have rambled in the mountains
and to have lost his way or to have met with some mischance it was
three days since he had disappeared but had been seen by some one the
last night at deb's hut

what and where was deb's hut

it was a hut in the wilderness occupied by an old indian woman known
among her neighbours by the name of old deb some people called her
queen mab her dwelling was eight long miles from this house

a thousand questions were precluded and a thousand doubts solved by this
information queen mab were sounds familiar to my ears for they
originated with myself

this woman originally belonged to the tribe of delawares or
lenni-lennapee all these districts were once comprised within the
dominions of that nation about thirty years ago in consequence of
perpetual encroachments of the english colonists they abandoned their
ancient seats and retired to the banks of the wabash and muskingum

this emigration was concerted in a general council of the tribe and
obtained the concurrence of all but one female her birth talents and
age gave her much consideration and authority among her countrymen and
all her zeal and eloquence were exerted to induce them to lay aside
their scheme in this however she could not succeed finding them
refractory she declared her resolution to remain behind and maintain
possession of the land which her countrymen should impiously abandon

the village inhabited by this clan was built upon ground which now
constitutes my uncle's barnyard and orchard on the departure of her
countrymen this female burnt the empty wigwams and retired into the
fastnesses of norwalk she selected a spot suitable for an indian
dwelling and a small plantation of maize and in which she was seldom
liable to interruption and intrusion

her only companions were three dogs of the indian or wolf species
these animals differed in nothing from their kinsmen of the forest but
in their attachment and obedience to their mistress she governed them
with absolute sway they were her servants and protectors and attended
her person or guarded her threshold agreeably to her directions she
fed them with corn and they supplied her and themselves with meat by
hunting squirrels raccoons and rabbits

to the rest of mankind they were aliens or enemies they never left the
desert but in company with their mistress and when she entered a
farm-house waited her return at a distance they would suffer none to
approach them but attacked no one who did not imprudently crave their
acquaintance or who kept at a respectful distance from their wigwam
that sacred asylum they would not suffer to be violated and no stranger
could enter it but at the imminent hazard of his life unless
accompanied and protected by their dame

the chief employment of this woman when at home besides plucking the
weeds from among her corn bruising the grain between two stones and
setting her snares for rabbits and opossums was to talk though in
solitude her tongue was never at rest but when she was asleep but her
conversation was merely addressed to her dogs her voice was sharp and
shrill and her gesticulations were vehement and grotesque a hearer
would naturally imagine that she was scolding but in truth she was
merely giving them directions having no other object of contemplation
or subject of discourse she always found in their postures and looks
occasion for praise or blame or command the readiness with which they
understood and the docility with which they obeyed her movements and
words were truly wonderful

if a stranger chanced to wander near her hut and overhear her jargon
incessant as it was and shrill he might speculate in vain on the
reason of these sounds if he waited in expectation of hearing some
reply he waited in vain the strain always voluble and sharp was
never intermitted for a moment and would continue for hours at a time

she seldom left the hut but to visit the neighbouring inhabitants and
demand from them food and clothing or whatever her necessities
required these were exacted as her due to have her wants supplied was
her prerogative and to withhold what she claimed was rebellion she
conceived that by remaining behind her countrymen she succeeded to the
government and retained the possession of all this region the english
were aliens and sojourners who occupied the land merely by her
connivance and permission and whom she allowed to remain on no terms
but those of supplying her wants

being a woman aged and harmless her demands being limited to that of
which she really stood in need and which her own industry could not
procure her pretensions were a subject of mirth and good-humour and
her injunctions obeyed with seeming deference and gravity to me she
early became an object of curiosity and speculation i delighted to
observe her habits and humour her prejudices she frequently came to my
uncle's house and i sometimes visited her insensibly she seemed to
contract an affection for me and regarded me with more complacency and
condescension than any other received

she always disdained to speak english and custom had rendered her
intelligible to most in her native language with regard to a few simple
questions i had taken some pains to study her jargon and could make
out to discourse with her on the few ideas which she possessed this
circumstance likewise wonderfully prepossessed her in my favour

the name by which she was formerly known was deb but her pretensions to
royalty the wildness of her aspect and garb her shrivelled and
diminutive form a constitution that seemed to defy the ravages of time
and the influence of the elements her age which some did not scruple
to affirm exceeded a hundred years her romantic solitude and
mountainous haunts suggested to my fancy the appellation of queen
mab there appeared to me some rude analogy between this personage
and her whom the poets of old time have delighted to celebrate thou
perhaps wilt discover nothing but incongruities between them but be
that as it may old deb and queen mab soon came into indiscriminate and
general use

she dwelt in norwalk upwards of twenty years she was not forgotten by
her countrymen and generally received from her brothers and sons an
autumnal visit but no solicitations or entreaties could prevail on her
to return with them two years ago some suspicion or disgust induced
her to forsake her ancient habitation and to seek a hew one happily she
found a more convenient habitation twenty miles to the westward and in
a spot abundantly sterile and rude

this dwelling was of logs and had been erected by a scottish emigrant
who not being rich enough to purchase land and entertaining a passion
for solitude and independence cleared a field in the unappropriated
wilderness and subsisted on its produce after some time he disappeared
various conjectures were formed as to the cause of his absence none of
them were satisfactory but that which obtained most credit was that
he had been murdered by the indians who about the same period paid
their annual visit to the queen this conjecture acquired some
force by observing that the old woman shortly after took possession of
his hut his implements of tillage and his corn-field

she was not molested in her new abode and her life passed in the same
quiet tenor as before her periodical rambles her regal claims her
guardian wolves and her uncouth volubility were equally remarkable
but her circuits were new her distance made her visits to solebury more
rare and had prevented me from ever extending my pedestrian excursions
to her present abode

these recollections were now suddenly called up by the information of my
hostess the hut where i had sought shelter and relief was it seems
the residence of queen mab some fortunate occurrence had called her
away during my visit had she and her dogs been at home i should have
been set upon by these ferocious sentinels and before their dame could
have interfered have been together with my helpless companion mangled
or killed these animals never barked i should have entered unaware of
my danger and my fate could scarcely have been averted by my fusil

her absence at this unseasonable hour was mysterious it was now the
time of year when her countrymen were accustomed to renew their visit
was there a league between her and the plunderers whom i had
encountered

but who were they by whom my footsteps were so industriously traced
those whom i had seen at deb's hut were strangers to me but the wound
upon my face was known only to them to this circumstance was now added
my place of residence and name i supposed them impressed with the
belief that i was dead but this mistake must have speedily been
rectified revisiting the spot finding me gone and obtaining some
intelligence of my former condition they had instituted a search after
me

but what tidings were these i was supposed to have been bewildered in
the mountains and three days were said to have passed since my
disappearance twelve hours had scarcely elapsed since i emerged from
the cavern had two days and a half been consumed in my subterranean
prison

these reflections were quickly supplanted by others i now gained a
sufficient acquaintance with the region that was spread around me i was
in the midst of a vale included between ridges that gradually approached
each other and when joined were broken up into hollows and steeps
and spreading themselves over a circular space assumed the appellation
of norwalk this vale gradually widened as it tended to the westward
and was in this place ten or twelve miles in breadth my devious
footsteps had brought me to the foot of the southern barrier the outer
basis of this was laved by the river but as it tended eastward the
mountain and river receded from each other and one of the cultivable
districts lying between them was solesbury my natal township
hither it was now my duty to return with the utmost expedition

there were two ways before me one lay along the interior base of the
hill over a sterile and trackless space and exposed to the encounter
of savages some of whom might possibly be lurking here the other was
the well-frequented road on the outside and along the river and which
was to be gained by passing over this hill the practicability of the
passage was to be ascertained by inquiries made to my hostess she
pointed out a path that led to the rocky summit and down to the river's
brink the path was not easy to be kept in view or to be trodden but it
was undoubtedly to be preferred to any other

a route somewhat circuitous would terminate in the river-road
thenceforward the way to solesbury was level and direct but the whole
space which i had to traverse was not less than thirty miles in six
hours it would be night and to perform the journey in that time would
demand the agile boundings of a leopard and the indefatigable sinews of
an elk

my frame was in a miserable plight my strength had been assailed by
anguish and fear and watchfulness by toil and abstinence and
wounds still however some remnant was left would it not enable me to
reach my home by nightfall i had delighted from my childhood in feats
of agility and perseverance in roving through the maze of thickets and
precipices i had put my energies both moral and physical frequently
to the test greater achievements than this had been performed and i
disdained to be outdone in perspicacity by the lynx in his sure-footed
instinct by the roe or in patience under hardship and contention with
fatigue by the mohawk i have ever aspired to transcend the rest of
animals in all that is common to the rational and brute as well as in
all by which they are distinguished from each other




chapter xxi


i likewise burned with impatience to know the condition of my family to
dissipate at once their tormenting doubts and my own with regard to our
mutual safety the evil that i feared had befallen them was too enormous
to allow me to repose in suspense and my restlessness and ominous
forebodings would be more intolerable than any hardship or toils to
which i could possibly be subjected during this journey

i was much refreshed and invigorated by the food that i had taken and
by the rest of an hour with this stock of recruited force i determined
to scale the hill after receiving minute directions and returning
many thanks for my hospitable entertainment i set out

the path was indeed intricate and deliberate attention was obliged to
be exerted in order to preserve it hence my progress was slower than i
wished the first impulse was to fix my eye upon the summit and to leap
from crag to crag till i reached it but this my experience had taught
me was impracticable it was only by winding through gullies and
coasting precipices and bestriding chasms that i could hope finally to
gain the top and i was assured that by one way only was it possible to
accomplish even this

an hour was spent in struggling with impediments and i seemed to have
gained no way hence a doubt was suggested whether i had not missed the
true road in this doubt i was confirmed by the difficulties which now
grew up before me the brooks the angles and the hollows which my
hostess had described were not to be seen instead of these deeper
dells more headlong torrents and wider-gaping rifts were incessantly
encountered

to return was as hopeless as to proceed i consoled myself with thinking
that the survey which my informant had made of the hill-side might prove
inaccurate and that in spite of her predictions the heights might be
reached by other means than by those pointed out by her i will not
enumerate my toilsome expedients my frequent disappointments and my
desperate exertions suffice it to say that i gained the upper space not
till the sun had dipped beneath the horizon

my satisfaction at accomplishing thus much was not small and i hied
with renovated spirits to the opposite brow this proved to be a steep
that could not be descended the river flowed at its foot the opposite
bank was five hundred yards distant and was equally towering and steep
as that on which i stood appearances were adapted to persuade you that
these rocks had formerly joined but by some mighty effort of nature had
been severed that the stream might find way through the chasm the
channel however was encumbered with asperities over which the river
fretted and foamed with thundering impetuosity

i pondered for a while on these stupendous scenes they ravished my
attention from considerations that related to myself but this interval
was snort and i began to measure the descent in order to ascertain the
practicability of treading it my survey terminated in bitter
disappointment i turned my eye successively eastward and westward
solesbury lay in the former direction and thither i desired to go i
kept along the verge in this direction till i reached an impassable
rift beyond this i saw that the steep grew lower but it was impossible
to proceed farther higher up the descent might be practicable and
though more distant from solesbury it was better to reach the road even
at that distance than never to reach it

changing my course therefore i explored the spaces above the night
was rapidly advancing the gray clouds gathered in the southeast and a
chilling blast the usual attendant of a night in october began to
whistle among the pigmy cedars that scantily grew upon these heights my
progress would quickly be arrested by darkness and it behooved me to
provide some place of shelter and repose no recess better than a hollow
in the rock presented itself to my anxious scrutiny

meanwhile i would not dismiss the hope of reaching the road which i
saw some hundred feet below winding along the edge of the river before
daylight should utterly fail speedily these hopes derived new vigour
from meeting a ledge that irregularly declined from the brow of the
hill it was wide enough to allow of cautious footing on a similar
stratum or ledge projecting still farther from the body of the hill
and close to the surface of the river was the road this stratum
ascended from the level of the stream while that on which i trod
rapidly descended i hoped that they would speedily be blended or at
least approach so near as to allow me to leap from one to the other
without enormous hazard

this fond expectation was frustrated presently i perceived that the
ledge below began to descend while that above began to tend upward and
was quickly terminated by the uppermost surface of the cliff here it
was needful to pause i looked over the brink and considered whether i
might not leap from my present station without endangering my limbs the
road into which i should fall was a rocky pavement far from being
smooth the descent could not be less than forty or fifty feet such an
attempt was to the last degree hazardous but was it not better to
risk my life by leaping from this eminence than to remain and perish on
the top of this inhospitable mountain the toils which i had endured in
reaching this height appeared to my panic-struck fancy less easy to be
borne again than death

i know not but that i should have finally resolved to leap had not
different views been suggested by observing that the outer edge of the
road was in like manner the brow of a steep which terminated in the
river the surface of the road was twelve or fifteen feet above the
level of the stream which in this spot was still and smooth hence i
inferred that the water was not of inconsiderable depth to fall upon
rocky points was indeed dangerous but to plunge into water of
sufficient depth even from a height greater than that at which i now
stood especially to one to whom habit had rendered water almost as
congenial an element as air was scarcely attended with inconvenience
this expedient was easy and safe twenty yards from this spot the
channel was shallow and to gain the road from the stream was no
difficult exploit

some disadvantages however attended this scheme the water was smooth
but this might arise from some other cause than its depth my gun
likewise must be left behind me and that was a loss to which i felt
invincible repugnance to let it fall upon the road would put it in my
power to retrieve the possession but it was likely to be irreparably
injured by the fall

while musing upon this expedient and weighing injuries with benefits
the night closed upon me i now considered that should i emerge in
safety from the stream i should have many miles to travel before i
could reach a house my clothes meanwhile would be loaded with wet i
should be heart-pierced by the icy blast that now blew and my wounds
and bruises would be chafed into insupportable pain

i reasoned likewise on the folly of impatience and the necessity of
repose by thus long continuance in one posture my sinews began to
stiffen and my reluctance to make new exertions to increase my brows
were heavy and i felt an irresistible propensity to sleep i concluded
to seek some shelter and resign myself my painful recollections and
my mournful presages to sweet forgetfulness for this end i once more
ascended to the surface of the cliff i dragged my weary feet forward
till i found somewhat that promised me the shelter that i sought

a cluster of cedars appeared whose branches overarched a space that
might be called a bower it was a slight cavity whose flooring was
composed of loose stones and a few faded leaves blown from a distance
and finding a temporary lodgment here on one side was a rock forming a
wall rugged and projecting above at the bottom of the rock was a rift
somewhat resembling a coffin in shape and not much larger in
dimensions this rift terminated on the opposite side of the rock in
an opening that was too small for the body of a man to pass the
distance between each entrance was twice the length of a man

this bower was open to the southeast whence the gale now blew it
therefore imperfectly afforded the shelter of which i stood in need
but it was the best that the place and the time afforded to stop the
smaller entrance of the cavity with a stone and to heap before the
other branches lopped from the trees with my hatchet might somewhat
contribute to my comfort

this was done and thrusting myself into this recess as far as i was
able i prepared for repose it might have been reasonably suspected to
be the den of rattlesnakes or panthers but my late contention with
superior dangers and more formidable enemies made me reckless of these
but another inconvenience remained in spite of my precautions my
motionless posture and slender covering exposed me so much to the cold
that i could not sleep

the air appeared to have suddenly assumed the temperature of midwinter
in a short time my extremities were benumbed and my limbs shivered and
ached as if i had been seized by an ague my bed likewise was dank and
uneven and the posture i was obliged to assume unnatural and painful
it was evident that my purpose could not be answered by remaining here

i therefore crept forth and began to reflect upon the possibility of
continuing my journey motion was the only thing that could keep me from
freezing and my frame was in that state which allowed me to take no
repose in the absence of warmth since warmth was indispensable it now
occurred to me to ask whether it were not possible to kindle a fire

sticks and leaves were at hand my hatchet and a pebble would enable me
to extract a spark from this by suitable care and perseverance i
might finally procure sufficient fire to give me comfort and ease and
even enable me to sleep this boon was delicious and i felt as if i
were unable to support a longer deprivation of it

i proceeded to execute this scheme i took the driest leaves and
endeavoured to use them as tinder but the driest leaves were moistened
by the dews they were only to be found in the hollows in some of which
were pools of water and others were dank i was not speedily
discouraged but my repeated attempts failed and i was finally
compelled to relinquish this expedient

all that now remained was to wander forth and keep myself in motion till
the morning the night was likely to prove tempestuous and long the
gale seemed freighted with ice and acted upon my body like the points
of a thousand needles there was no remedy and i mustered my patience
to endure it

i returned again to the brow of the hill i ranged along it till i
reached a place where the descent was perpendicular and in consequence
of affording no sustenance to trees or bushes was nearly smooth and
bare there was no road to be seen and this circumstance added to the
sounds which the rippling current produced afforded me some knowledge
of my situation

the ledge along which the road was conducted disappeared near this spot
the opposite sides of the chasm through which flowed the river
approached nearer to each other in the form of jutting promontories i
now stood upon the verge of that on the northern side the water
flowed at the foot but for the space of ten or twelve feet from the
rock was so shallow as to permit the traveller and his horse to wade
through it and thus to regain the road which the receding precipice had
allowed to be continued on the farther side

i knew the nature and dimensions of this ford i knew that at a few
yards from the rock the channel was of great depth to leap into it in
this place was a less dangerous exploit than at the spot where i had
formerly been tempted to leap there i was unacquainted with the depth
but here i knew it to be considerable still there was some ground of
hesitation and fear my present station was loftier and how deeply i
might sink into this gulf how far the fall and the concussion would
bereave me of my presence of mind i could not determine this
hesitation vanished and placing my tomahawk and fusil upon the ground
i prepared to leap

this purpose was suspended in the moment of its execution by a faint
sound heard from the quarter whence i had come it was the warning of
men but had nothing in common with those which i had been accustomed to
hear it was not the howling of a wolf or the yelling of a panther
these had often been overheard by night during my last year's excursion
to the lakes my fears whispered that this was the vociferation of a
savage

i was unacquainted with the number of the enemies who had adventured
into this district whether those whom i had encountered at deb's
hut were of that band whom i had met with in the cavern was merely
a topic of conjecture there might be a half-score of troops equally
numerous spread over the wilderness and the signal i had just heard
might betoken the approach of one of these yet by what means they
should gain this nook and what prey they expected to discover were not
easily conceived

the sounds somewhat diversified nearer and rising from different
quarters were again heard my doubts and apprehensions were increased
what expedient to adopt for my own safety was a subject of rapid
meditation whether to remain stretched upon the ground or to rise and
go forward was it likely the enemy would coast along the edge of the
steep would they ramble hither to look upon the ample scene which
spread on all sides around the base of this rocky pinnacle in that
case how should i conduct myself my arms were ready for use could i
not elude the necessity of shedding more blood could i not anticipate
their assault by casting myself without delay into the stream

the sense of danger demanded more attention to be paid to external
objects than to the motives by which my future conduct should be
influenced my post was on a circular prefecture in some degree
detached from the body of the hill the brow of which continued in a
straight line uninterrupted by this projecture which was somewhat
higher than the continued summit of the ridge this line ran at the
distance of a few paces from my post objects moving along this line
could merely be perceived to move in the present obscurity

my scrutiny was entirely directed to this quarter presently the
treading of many feet was heard and several figures were discovered
following each other in that straight and regular succession which is
peculiar to the indians they kept along the brow of the hill joining
the promontory i distinctly marked seven figures in succession

my resolution was formed should any one cast his eye hither suspect or
discover an enemy and rush towards me i determined to start upon my
feet fire on my foe as he advanced throw my piece on the ground and
then leap into the river

happily they passed unobservant and in silence i remained in the same
posture for several minutes at length just as my alarms began to
subside the halloos before heard arose and from the same quarter as
before this convinced me that my perils were not at an end this now
appeared to be merely the vanguard and would speedily be followed by
others against whom the same caution was necessary to be taken

my eye anxiously bent the only way by which any one could approach now
discerned a figure which was indubitably that of a man armed none
other appeared in company but doubtless others were near he
approached stood still and appeared to gaze steadfastly at the spot
where i lay

the optics of a lenni-lennapee i knew to be far keener than my
own a log or a couched fawn would never be mistaken for a man nor a
man for a couched fawn or a log not only a human being would be
instantly detected but a decision be unerringly made whether it wrere
friend or foe that my prostrate body was the object on which the
attention of this vigilant and steadfast gazer was fixed could not be
doubted yet since he continued an inactive gazer there was ground for
a possibility to stand upon that i was not recognised my fate therefore
was still in suspense

this interval was momentary i marked a movement which my fears
instantly interpreted to be that of levelling a gun at my head this
action was sufficiently conformable to my prognostics supposing me to
be detected there was no need for him to change his post aim might be
too fatally taken and his prey be secured from the distance at which
he now stood

these images glanced upon my thought and put an end to my suspense a
single effort placed me on my feet i fired with a precipitation that
precluded the certainty of hitting my mark dropped my piece upon the
ground and leaped from this tremendous height into the river i reached
the surface and sunk in a moment to the bottom

plunging endlong into the water the impetus created by my fall from
such a height would be slowly resisted by this denser element had the
depth been less its resistance would not perhaps have hindered me from
being mortally injured against the rocky bottom had the depth been
greater time enough would not have been allowed me to regain the
surface had i fallen on my side i should have been bereft of life or
sensibility by the shock which my frame would have received as it was
my fate was suspended on a thread to have lost my presence of mind to
have forborne to counteract my sinking for an instant after i had
reached the water would have made all exertions to regain the air
fruitless to so fortunate a concurrence of events was thy friend
indebted for his safety

yet i only emerged from the gulf to encounter new perils scarcely had i
raised my head above the surface and inhaled the vital breath when
twenty shots were aimed at me from the precipice above a shower of
bullets fell upon the water some of them did not fall farther than two
inches from my head i had not been aware of this new danger and now
that it assailed me continued gasping the air and floundering at
random the means of eluding it did not readily occur my case seemed
desperate and all caution was dismissed

this state of discomfiting surprise quickly disappeared i made myself
acquainted at a glance with the position of surrounding objects i
conceived that the opposite bank of the river would afford me most
security and thither i tended with all the expedition in my power

meanwhile my safety depended on eluding the bullets that continued
incessantly to strike the water at an arm's-length from my body for
this end i plunged beneath the surface and only rose to inhale fresh
air presently the firing ceased the flashes that lately illuminated
the bank disappeared and a certain bustle and murmur of confused voices
gave place to solitude and silence




chapter xxii


i reached without difficulty the opposite bank but the steep was
inaccessible i swam along the edge in hopes of meeting with some
projection or recess where i might at least rest my weary limbs and
if it were necessary to recross the river to lay in a stock of
recruited spirits and strength for that purpose i trusted that the
water would speedily become shoal or that the steep would afford rest
to my feet in both these hopes i was disappointed

there is no one to whom i would yield the superiority in swimming but
my strength like that of other human beings had its limits my
previous fatigues had been enormous and my clothes heavy with
moisture greatly encumbered and retarded my movements i had proposed
to free myself from this imprisonment but i foresaw the inconveniences
of wandering over this scene in absolute nakedness and was willing
therefore at whatever hazard to retain them i continued to struggle
with the current and to search for the means of scaling the steeps my
search was fruitless and i began to meditate the recrossing of the
river

surely my fate has never been paralleled where was this series of
hardships and perils to end no sooner was one calamity eluded than i
was beset by another i had emerged from abhorred darkness in the heart
of the earth only to endure the extremities of famine and encounter the
fangs of a wild beast from these i was delivered only to be thrown into
the midst of savages to wage an endless and hopeless war with adepts in
killing with appetites that longed to feast upon my bowels and to quaff
my heart's blood from these likewise was i rescued but merely to
perish in the gulfs of the river to welter on unvisited shores or to
be washed far away from curiosity or pity

formerly water was not only my field of sport but my sofa and my bed i
could float for hours on its surface enjoying its delicious cool
almost without the expense of the slightest motion it was an element as
fitted for repose as for exercise but now the buoyant spirit seemed to
have flown my muscles were shrunk the air and water were equally
congealed and my most vehement exertions were requisite to sustain me
on the surface

at first i had moved along with my wonted celerity and ease but quickly
my forces were exhausted my pantings and efforts were augmented and i
saw that to cross the river again was impracticable i must continue
therefore to search out some accessible spot in the bank along which i
was swimming

each moment diminished my stock of strength and it behooved me to make
good my footing before another minute should escape i continued to
swim to survey the bank and to make ineffectual attempts to grasp the
rock the shrubs which grew upon it would not uphold me and the
fragments which for a moment inspired me with hope crumbled away as
soon as they were touched

at length i noticed a pine which was rooted in a crevice near the water
the trunk or any part of the root was beyond my reach but i trusted
that i could catch hold of the branch which hung lowest and that when
caught it would assist me in gaining the trunk and thus deliver me
from the death which could not be otherwise averted

the attempt was arduous had it been made when i first reached the bank
no difficulty had attended it but now to throw myself some feet above
the surface could scarcely be expected from one whose utmost efforts
seemed to be demanded to keep him from sinking yet this exploit
arduous as it was was attempted and accomplished happily the twigs
were strong enough to sustain my weight till i caught at other branches
and finally placed myself upon the trunk

this danger was now past but i admitted the conviction that others no
less formidable remained to be encountered and that my ultimate
destiny was death i looked upward new efforts might enable me to gain
the summit of this steep but perhaps i should thus be placed merely in
the situation from which i had just been delivered it was of little
moment whether the scene of my imprisonment was a dungeon not to be
broken or a summit from which descent was impossible

the river indeed severed me from a road which was level and safe but
my recent dangers were remembered only to make me shudder at the thought
of incurring them a second time by attempting to cross it i blush at
the recollection of this cowardice it was little akin to the spirit
which i had recently displayed it was indeed an alien to my bosom
and was quickly supplanted by intrepidity and perseverance

i proceeded to mount the hill from root to root and from branch to
branch lay my journey it was finished and i sat down upon the highest
brow to meditate on future trials no road lay along this side of the
river it was rugged and sterile and farms were sparingly dispersed
over it to reach one of these was now the object of my wishes i had
not lost the desire of reaching solesbury before morning but my wet
clothes and the coldness of the night seemed to have bereaved me of the
power

i traversed this summit keeping the river on my right hand happily
its declinations and ascents were by no means difficult and i was
cheered in the midst of my vexations by observing that every mile
brought me nearer to my uncle's dwelling meanwhile i anxiously looked
for some tokens of a habitation these at length presented themselves a
wild heath whistled over by october blasts meagrely adorned with the
dry stalks of scented shrubs and the bald heads of the sapless mullein
was succeeded by a fenced field and a corn-stack the dwelling to which
these belonged was eagerly sought

i was not surprised that all voices were still and all lights
extinguished for this was the hour of repose having reached a piazza
before the house i paused whether at this drowsy time to knock for
admission to alarm the peaceful tenants and take from them the rest
which their daily toils and their rural innocence had made so sweet or
to retire to what shelter a haystack or barn could afford was the theme
of my deliberations

meanwhile i looked up at the house it was the model of cleanliness and
comfort it was built of wood but the materials had undergone the
plane as well as the axe and the saw it was painted white and the
windows not only had sashes but these sashes were supplied contrary to
custom with glass in most cases the aperture where glass should be is
stuffed with an old hat or a petticoat the door had not only all its
parts entire but was embellished with mouldings and a pediment i
gathered from these tokens that this was the abode not only of rural
competence and innocence but of some beings raised by education and
fortune above the intellectual mediocrity of clowns

methought i could claim consanguity with such beings not to share their
charity and kindness would be inflicting as well as receiving injury
the trouble of affording shelter and warmth and wholesome diet to a
wretch destitute as i was would be eagerly sought by them

still i was unwilling to disturb them i bethought myself that their
kitchen might be entered and all that my necessities required be
obtained without interrupting their slumber i needed nothing but the
warmth which their kitchen-hearth would afford stretched upon the
bricks i might dry my clothes and perhaps enjoy some unmolested sleep
in spite of presages of ill and the horrid remembrances of what i had
performed and endured i believed that nature would afford a short
respite to my cares

i went to the door of what appeared to be a kitchen the door was wide
open this circumstance portended evil though it be not customary to
lock or to bolt it is still less usual to have entrances unclosed i
entered with suspicious steps and saw enough to confirm my
apprehensions several pieces of wood half burned lay in the midst of
the floor they appeared to have been removed hither from the chimney
doubtless with a view to set fire to the whole building

the fire had made some progress on the floor but had been seasonably
extinguished by pailfuls of water thrown upon it the floor was still
deluged with wet the pail not emptied of all its contents stood upon
the hearth the earthen vessels and plates whose proper place was the
dresser were scattered in fragments in all parts of the room i looked
around me for some one to explain this scene but no one appeared

the last spark of fire was put out so that had my curiosity been idle
my purpose could not be accomplished to retire from this scene neither
curiosity nor benevolence would permit that some mortal injury had been
intended was apparent what greater mischief had befallen or whether
greater might not by my interposition be averted could only be
ascertained by penetrating farther into the house i opened a door on
one side which led to the main body of the building and entered to a
bed-chamber i stood at the entrance and knocked but no one answered my
signals

the sky was not totally clouded so that some light pervaded the room i
saw that a bed stood in the corner but whether occupied or not its
curtains hindered me from judging i stood in suspense a few minutes
when a motion in the bed showed me that some one was there i knocked
again but withdrew to the outside of the door this roused the sleeper
who half groaning and puffing the air through his nostrils grumbled
out in the hoarsest voice that i ever heard and in a tone of surly
impatience who is there

i hesitated for an answer but the voice instantly continued in the
manner of one half asleep and enraged at being disturbed is't you
peg damn ye stay away now i tell ye stay away or by god i will
cut your throat i will he continued to mutter and swear but without
coherence or distinctness

these were the accents of drunkenness and denoted a wild and ruffian
life they were little in unison with the external appearances of the
mansion and blasted all the hopes i had formed of meeting under this
roof with gentleness and hospitality to talk with this being to
attempt to reason him into humanity and soberness was useless i was at
a loss in what manner to address him or whether it was proper to
maintain any parley meanwhile my silence was supplied by the
suggestions of his own distempered fancy ay said he ye will will
ye well come on let's see who's the better at the oak stick if i
part with ye before i have bared your bones i'll teach ye to be always
dipping in my dish ye devil's dam ye

so saying he tumbled out of bed at the first step he struck his head
against the bedpost but setting himself upright he staggered towards
the spot where i stood some new obstacle occurred he stumbled and fell
at his length upon the floor

to encounter or expostulate with a man in this state was plainly absurd
i turned and issued forth with an aching heart into the court before
the house the miseries which a debauched husband or father inflicted
upon all whom their evil destiny allies to him were pictured by my
fancy and wrung from me tears of anguish these images however
quickly yielded to reflections on my own state no expedient now
remained but to seek the barn and find a covering and a bed of straw

i had scarcely set foot within the barnyard when i heard a sound as of
the crying of an infant it appeared to issue from the barn i
approached softly and listened at the door the cries of the babe
continued but were accompanied by the entreaties of a nurse or a mother
to be quiet these entreaties were mingled with heart-breaking sobs and
exclamations of ah me my babe canst thou not sleep and afford thy
unhappy mother some peace thou art cold and i have not sufficient
warmth to cherish thee what will become of us thy deluded father cares
not if we both perish

a glimpse of the true nature of the scene seemed to be imparted by these
words i now likewise recollected incidents that afforded additional
light somewhere on this bank of the river there formerly resided one by
name selby he was an aged person who united science and taste to the
simple and laborious habits of a husbandman he had a son who resided
several years in europe but on the death of his father returned home
accompanied by a wife he had succeeded to the occupation of the farm
but rumour had whispered many tales to the disadvantage of his morals
his wife was affirmed to be of delicate and polished manners and much
unlike her companion

it now occurred to me that this was the dwelling of the selbys and i
seemed to have gained some insight into the discord and domestic
miseries by which the unhappy lady suffered this was no time to waste
my sympathy on others i could benefit her nothing selby had probably
returned from a carousal with all his malignant passions raised into
frenzy by intoxication he had driven his desolate wife from her bed and
house and to shun outrage and violence she had fled with her
helpless infant to the barn to appease his fury to console her to
suggest a remedy for this distress was not in my power to have sought
an interview would be merely to excite her terrors and alarm her
delicacy without contributing to alleviate her calamity here then
was no asylum for me a place of rest must be sought at some
neighbouring habitation it was probable that one would be found at no
great distance the path that led from the spot where i stood through a
gate into a meadow might conduct me to the nearest dwelling and this
path i immediately resolved to explore

i was anxious to open the gate without noise but i could not succeed
some creaking of its hinges was unavoidably produced which i feared
would be overheard by the lady and multiply her apprehensions and
perplexities this inconvenience was irremediable i therefore closed
the gate and pursued the footway before me with the utmost expedition i
had not gained the farther end of the meadow when i lighted on something
which lay across the path and which on being closely inspected
appeared to be a human body it was the corpse of a girl mangled by a
hatchet her head gory and deprived of its locks easily explained the
kind of enemies by whom she had been assailed here was proof that this
quiet and remote habitation had been visited in their destructive
progress by the indians the girl had been slain by them and her
scalp according to their savage custom had been torn away to be
preserved as a trophy

the fire which had been kindled on the kitchen-floor tvas now
remembered and corroborated the inferences which were drawn from this
spectacle and yet that the mischief had been thus limited that the
besotted wretch who lay helpless on his bed and careless of impending
danger and that the mother and her infant should escape excited some
degree of surprise could the savages have been interrupted in their
work and obliged to leave their vengeance unfinished

their visit had been recent many hours had not elapsed since they
prowled about these grounds had they wholly disappeared and meant they
not to return to what new danger might i be exposed in remaining thus
guideless and destitute of all defence

in consequence of these reflections i proceeded with more caution i
looked with suspicious glances before and on either side of me i now
approached the fence which on this side bounded the meadow something
was discerned or imagined stretched close to the fence on the ground
and filling up the pathway my apprehensions of a lurking enemy had been
previously awakened and my fancy instantly figured to itself an armed
man lying on the ground and waiting to assail the unsuspecting
passenger

at first i was prompted to fly but a second thought showed me that i
had already approached near enough to be endangered notwithstanding my
pause the form was motionless the possibility of being misled in my
conjectures was easily supposed what i saw might be a log or it might
be another victim to savage ferocity this track was that which my
safety required me to pursue to turn aside or go back would be merely
to bewilder myself anew

urged by these motives i went nearer and at last was close enough to
perceive that the figure was human he lay upon his face near his right
hand was a musket unclenched this circumstance his deathlike
attitude and the garb and ornaments of an indian made me readily
suspect the nature and cause of this catastrophe here the invaders had
been encountered and repulsed and one at least of their number had been
left upon the field

i was weary of contemplating these rueful objects custom likewise
even in so short a period had inured me to spectacles of horror i was
grown callous and immovable i stayed not to ponder on the scene but
snatching the musket which was now without an owner and which might be
indispensable to my defence i hastened into the wood on this side the
meadow was skirted by a forest but a beaten road led into it and might
therefore be attempted without danger




chapter xxiii


the road was intricate and long it seemed designed to pervade the
forest in every possible direction i frequently noticed cut wood piled
in heaps upon either side and rejoiced in these tokens that the
residence of man was near at length i reached a second fence which
proved to be the boundary of a road still more frequented i pursued
this and presently beheld before me the river and its opposite
barriers

this object afforded me some knowledge of my situation there was a ford
over which travellers used to pass and in which the road that i was now
pursuing terminated the stream was rapid and tumultuous but in this
place did not rise higher than the shoulders on the opposite side was a
highway passable by horses and men though not by carriages and which
led into the midst of solesbury should i not rush into the stream and
still aim at reaching my uncle's house before morning why should i
delay

thirty hours of incessant watchfulness and toil of enormous efforts and
perils preceded and accompanied by abstinence and wounds were enough
to annihilate the strength and courage of ordinary men in the course of
them i had frequently believed myself to have reached the verge beyond
which my force would not carry me but experience as frequently
demonstrated my error though many miles were yet to be traversed
though my clothes were once more to be drenched and loaded with
moisture though every hour seemed to add somewhat to the keenness of
the blast yet how should i know but by trial whether my stock of
energy was not sufficient for this last exploit

my resolution to proceed was nearly formed when the figure of a man
moving slowly across the road at some distance before me was observed
hard by this ford lived a man by name bisset of whom i had slight
knowledge he tended his two hundred acres with a plodding and
money-doting spirit while his son overlooked a grist-mill on the river
he was a creature of gain coarse and harmless the man whom i saw before
me might be he or some one belonging to his family being armed for
defence i less scrupled at meeting with any thing in the shape of man
i therefore called the figure stopped and answered me without surliness
or anger the voice was unlike that of bisset but this person's
information i believed would be of some service

coming up to him he proved to be a clown belonging to bisset's
habitation his panic and surprise on seeing me made him aghast in my
present garb i should not have easily been recognised by my nearest
kinsman and much less easily by one who had seldom met me

it may be easily conceived that my thoughts when allowed to wander from
the objects before me were tormented with forebodings and inquietudes
on account of the ills which i had so much reason to believe had
befallen my family i had no doubt that some evil had happened but the
full extent of it was still uncertain i desired and dreaded to discover
the truth and was unable to interrogate this person in a direct manner
i could deal only in circuities and hints i shuddered while i waited
for an answer to my inquiries

had not indians i asked been lately seen in this neighbourhood were
they not suspected of hostile designs had they not already committed
some mischief some passenger perhaps had been attacked or fire had
been set to some house on which side of the river had their steps been
observed or any devastation been committed above the ford or below it
at what distance from the river

when his attention could be withdrawn from my person and bestowed upon
my questions he answered that some alarm had indeed been spread about
indians and that parties from solesbury and chetasco were out in
pursuit of them that many persons had been killed by them and that one
house in solesbury had been rifled and burnt on the night before the
last

these tidings were a dreadful confirmation of my fears there scarcely
remained a doubt but still my expiring hope prompted me to inquire to
whom did the house belong

he answered that he had not heard the name of the owner he was a
stranger to the people on the other side of the river

were any of the inhabitants murdered

yes all that were at home except a girl whom they carried off some
said that the girl had been retaken

what was the name was it huntly

huntly yes no he did not know he had forgotten

i fixed my eyes upon the ground an interval of gloomy meditation
succeeded all was lost all for whose sake i had desired to live had
perished by the hands of these assassins that dear home the scene of
my sportive childhood of my studies labours and recreations was
ravaged by fire and the sword was reduced to a frightful ruin

not only all that embellished and endeared existence was destroyed but
the means of subsistence itself thou knowest that my sisters and i were
dependants on the bounty of our uncle his death would make way for the
succession of his son a man fraught with envy and malignity who always
testified a mortal hatred to us merely because we enjoyed the
protection of his father the ground which furnished me with bread was
now become the property of one who if he could have done it with
security would gladly have mingled poison with my food

all that my imagination or my heart regarded as of value had likewise
perished whatever my chamber my closets my cabinets contained my
furniture my books the records of my own skill the monuments of their
existence whom i loved my very clothing were involved in
indiscriminate and irretrievable destruction why should i survive this
calamity

but did not he say that one had escaped the only females in the family
were my sisters one of these had been reserved for a fate worse than
death to gratify the innate and insatiable cruelty of savages by
suffering all the torments their invention can suggest or to linger out
years of weary bondage and unintermitted hardship in the bosom of the
wilderness to restore her to liberty to cherish this last survivor of
my unfortunate race was a sufficient motive to life and to activity

but soft had not rumour whispered that the captive was retaken oh who
was her angel of deliverance where did she now abide weeping over the
untimely fall of her protector and her friend lamenting and upbraiding
the absence of her brother why should i not haste to find her to
mingle my tears with hers to assure her of my safety and expatiate the
involuntary crime of my desertion by devoting all futurity to the task
of her consolation and improvement

the path was open and direct my new motives would have trampled upon
every impediment and made me reckless of all dangers and all toils i
broke from my reverie and without taking leave or expressing gratitude
to my informant i ran with frantic expedition towards the river and
plunging into it gained the opposite side in a moment

i was sufficiently acquainted with the road some twelve or fifteen
miles remained to be traversed i did not fear that my strength would
fail in the performance of my journey it was not my uncle's habitation
to which i directed my steps inglefield was my friend if my sister had
existence or was snatched from captivity it was here that an asylum
had been afforded to her and here was i to seek the knowledge of my
destiny for this reason having reached a spot where the road divided
into two branches one of which led to inglefield's and the other to
huntly's i struck into the former

scarcely had i passed the angle when i noticed a building on the right
hand at some distance from the road in the present state of my
thoughts it would not have attracted my attention had not a light
gleamed from an upper window and told me that all within were not at
rest

i was acquainted with the owner of this mansion he merited esteem and
confidence and could not fail to be acquainted with recent events from
him i should obtain all the information that i needed and i should be
delivered from some part of the agonies of my suspense i should reach
his door in a few minutes and the window-light was a proof that my
entrance at this hour would not disturb the family some of whom were
stirring

through a gate i entered an avenue of tall oaks that led to the house
i could not but reflect on the effect which my appearance would produce
upon the family the sleek locks neat apparel pacific guise sobriety
and gentleness of aspect by which i was customarily distinguished would
in vain be sought in the apparition which would now present itself
before them my legs neck and bosom were bare and their native hue
was exchanged for the livid marks of bruises and scarifications a
horrid scar upon my cheek and my uncombed locks hollow eyes made
ghastly by abstinence and cold and the ruthless passions of which my
mind had been the theatre added to the musket which i carried in my
hand would prepossess them with the notion of a maniac or ruffian

some inconveniences might hence arise which however could not be
avoided i must trust to the speed with which my voice and my words
should disclose my true character and rectify their mistake

i now reached the principal door of the house it was open and i
unceremoniously entered in the midst of the room stood a german stove
well heated to thaw my half-frozen limbs was my first care meanwhile i
gazed around me and marked the appearances of things

two lighted candles stood upon the table beside them were cider-bottles
and pipes of tobacco the furniture and room was in that state which
denoted it to have been lately filled with drinkers and smokers yet
neither voice nor visage nor motion were anywhere observable i
listened but neither above nor below within nor without could any
tokens of a human being be perceived

this vacancy and silence must have been lately preceded by noise and
concourse and bustle the contrast was mysterious and ambiguous no
adequate cause of so quick and absolute a transition occurred to me
having gained some warmth and lingered some ten or twenty minutes in
this uncertainty i determined to explore the other apartments of the
building i knew not what might betide in my absence or what i might
encounter in my search to justify precaution and therefore kept the
gun in my hand i snatched a candle from the table and proceeded into
two other apartments on the first floor and the kitchen neither was
inhabited though chairs and tables were arranged in their usual order
and no traces of violence or hurry were apparent

having gained the foot of the staircase i knocked but my knocking was
wholly disregarded a light had appeared in an upper chamber it was
not indeed in one of those apartments which the family permanently
occupied but in that which according to rural custom was reserved for
guests but it indubitably betokened the presence of some being by whom
my doubts might be solved these doubts were too tormenting to allow of
scruples and delay i mounted the stairs

at each chamber-door i knocked but i knocked in vain i tried to open
but found them to be locked i at length reached the entrance of that in
which a light had been discovered here it was certain that some one
would be found but here as well as elsewhere my knocking was
unnoticed

to enter this chamber was audacious but no other expedient was afforded
me to determine whether the house had any inhabitants i therefore
entered though with caution and reluctance no one was within but
there were sufficient traces of some person who had lately been here on
the table stood a travelling-escritoire open with pens and inkstand a
chair was placed before it and a candle on the right hand this
apparatus was rarely seen in this country some traveller it seemed
occupied this room though the rest of the mansion was deserted the
pilgrim as these appearances testified was of no vulgar order and
belonged not to the class of periodical and every-day guests

it now occurred to me that the occupant of this apartment could not be
far off and that some danger and embarrassment could not fail to accrue
from being found thus accoutred and garbed in a place sacred to the
study and repose of another it was proper therefore to withdraw and
either to resume my journey or wait for the stranger's return whom
perhaps some temporary engagement had called away in the lower and
public room the former now appeared to be the best expedient as the
return of this unknown person was uncertain as well as his power to
communicate the information which i wanted

had paper as well as the implements of writing lain upon the desk
perhaps my lawless curiosity would not have scrupled to have pried into
it on the first glance nothing of that kind appeared but now as i
turned towards the door somewhat lying beside the desk on the side
opposite the candle caught my attention the impulse was instantaneous
and mechanical that made me leap to the spot and lay my hand upon it
till i felt it between my fingers till i brought it near my eyes and
read frequently the inscriptions that appeared upon it i was doubtful
whether my senses had deceived me

few perhaps among mankind have undergone vicissitudes of peril and
wonder equal to mine the miracles of poetry the transitions of
enchantment are beggarly and mean compared with those which i had
experienced passage into new forms overleaping the bars of time and
space reversal of the laws of inanimate and intelligent existence had
been mine to perform and to witness

no event had been more fertile of sorrow and perplexity than the loss of
thy brother's letters they went by means invisible and disappeared at
a moment when foresight would have least predicted their disappearance
they now placed themselves before me in a manner equally abrupt in a
place and by means no less contrary to expectation the papers which i
now seized were those letters the parchment cover the string that tied
and the wax that sealed them appeared not to have been opened or
violated

the power that removed them from my cabinet and dropped them in this
house a house which i rarely visited which i had not entered during
the last year with whose inhabitants i maintained no cordial
intercourse and to whom my occupations and amusements my joys and my
sorrows were unknown was no object even of conjecture but they were
not possessed by any of the family some stranger was here by whom they
had been stolen or into whose possession they had by some
incomprehensible chance fallen

that stranger was near he had left this apartment for a moment he
would speedily return to go hence might possibly occasion me to miss
him here then i would wait till he should grant me an interview the
papers were mine and were recovered i would never part with them but
to know by whose force or by whose stratagems i had been bereaved of
them thus long was now the supreme passion of my soul i seated myself
near a table and anxiously waited for an interview on which i was
irresistibly persuaded to believe that much of my happiness depended

meanwhile i could not but connect this incident with the destruction of
my family the loss of these papers had excited transports of grief and
yet to have lost them thus was perhaps the sole expedient by which their
final preservation could be rendered possible had they remained in my
cabinet they could not have escaped the destiny which overtook the
house and its furniture savages are not accustomed to leave their
exterminating work unfinished the house which they have plundered they
are careful to level with the ground this not only their revenge but
their caution prescribes fire may originate by accident as well as by
design and the traces of pillage and murder are totally obliterated by
the flames

these thoughts were interrupted by the shutting of a door below and by
footsteps ascending the stairs my heart throbbed at the sound my seat
became uneasy and i started on my feet i even advanced half-way to the
entrance of the room my eyes were intensely fixed upon the door my
impatience would have made me guess at the person of this visitant by
measuring his shadow if his shadow were first seen but this was
precluded by the position of the light it was only when the figure
entered and the whole person was seen that my curiosity was gratified
he who stood before me was the parent and fosterer of my mind the
companion and instructor of my youth from whom i had been parted for
years from whom i believed myself to be forever separated sarsefield
himself




chapter xxiv


my deportment at an interview so much desired and so wholly unforeseen
was that of a maniac the petrifying influence of surprise yielded to
the impetuosities of passion i held him in my arms i wept upon his
bosom i sobbed with emotion which had it not found passage at my eyes
would have burst my heart-strings thus i who had escaped the deaths
that had previously assailed me in so many forms should have been
reserved to solemnize a scene like this by dying for joy

the sterner passions and habitual austerities of my companion exempted
him from pouring out this testimony of his feelings his feelings were
indeed more allied to astonishment and incredulity than mine had been
my person was not instantly recognised he shrunk from my embrace as if
i were an apparition or impostor he quickly disengaged himself from my
arms and withdrawing a few paces gazed upon me as on one whom he had
never before seen

these repulses were ascribed to the loss of his affection i was not
mindful of the hideous guise in which i stood before him and by which
he might justly be misled to imagine me a ruffian or a lunatic my tears
flowed now on a new account and i articulated in a broken and faint
voice my master my friend have you forgotten have you ceased to
love me

the sound of my voice made him start and exclaim am i alive am i
awake speak again i beseech you and convince me that i am not
dreaming or delirious

can you need any proof i answered that it is edgar huntly your
pupil your child that speaks to you

he now withdrew his eyes from me and fixed them on the floor after a
pause he resumed in emphatic accents well i have lived to this age
in unbelief to credit or trust in miraculous agency was foreign to my
nature but now i am no longer skeptical call me to any bar and exact
from me an oath that you have twice been dead and twice recalled to
life that you move about invisibly and change your place by the force
not of muscles but of thought and i will give it

how came you hither did you penetrate the wall did you rise through
the floor

yet surely tis an error you could not be he whom twenty witnesses
affirmed to have beheld a lifeless and mangled corpse upon the ground
whom my own eyes saw in that condition

in seeking the spot once more to provide you a grave you had vanished
again i met you you plunged into a rapid stream from a height from
which it was impossible to fall and to live yet as if to set the
limits of nature at defiance to sport with human penetration you rose
upon the surface you floated you swam thirty bullets were aimed at
your head by marksmen celebrated for the exactness of their sight i
myself was of the number and i never missed what i desired to hit

my predictions were confirmed by the event you ceased to struggle you
sunk to rise no more and yet after these accumulated deaths you light
upon this floor so far distant from the scene of your catastrophe over
spaces only to be passed in so short a time as has since elapsed by
those who have wings

my eyes my ears bear testimony to your existence now as they
formerly convinced me of your death what am i to think what proofs am
i to credit there he stopped

every accent of this speech added to the confusion of my thoughts the
allusions that my friend had made were not unintelligible i gained a
glimpse of the complicated errors by which we had been mutually
deceived i had fainted on the area before deb's hut i was found by
sarsefield in this condition and imagined to be dead

the man whom i had seen upon the promontory was not an indian he
belonged to a numerous band of pursuers whom my hostile and precipitate
deportment caused to suspect me for an enemy they that fired from the
steep were friends the interposition that screened me from so many
bullets was indeed miraculous no wonder that my voluntary sinking in
order to elude their shots was mistaken for death and that having
accomplished the destruction of this foe they resumed their pursuit of
others but how was sarsefield apprized that it was i who plunged into
the river no subsequent event was possible to impart to him the
incredible truth

a pause of mutual silence ensued at length sarsefield renewed his
expressions of amazement at this interview and besought me to explain
why i had disappeared by night from my uncle's house and by what series
of unheard-of events this interview was brought about was it indeed
huntly whom he examined and mourned over at the threshold of deb's hut
whom he had sought in every thicket and cave in the ample circuit of
norwalk and chetasco whom he had seen perish in the current of the
delaware

instead of noticing his questions my soul was harrowed with anxiety
respecting the fate of my uncle and sisters sarsefield could
communicate the tidings which would decide on my future lot and set my
portion in happiness or misery yet i had not breath to speak my
inquiries hope tottered and i felt as if a single word would be
sufficient for its utter subversion at length i articulated the name of
my uncle

the single word sufficiently imparted my fears and these fears needed
no verbal confirmation at that dear name my companion's features were
overspread by sorrow

your uncle said he is dead

dead merciful heaven and my sisters too both

your sisters are alive and well

nay resumed i in faltering accents jest not with my feelings be
not cruel in your pity tell me the truth

i have said the truth they are well at mr inglefield's

my wishes were eager to assent to the truth of these tidings the better
part of me was then safe but how did they escape the fate that
overtook my uncle how did they evade the destroying hatchet and the
midnight conflagration these doubts were imparted in a tumultuous and
obscure manner to my friend he no sooner fully comprehended them than
he looked at me with some inquietude and surprise

huntly said he are you mad what has filled you with these hideous
prepossessions much havoc has indeed been committed in chetasco and the
wilderness and a log hut has been burnt by design or by accident in
solesbury but that is all your house has not been assailed by either
firebrand or tomahawk every thing is safe and in its ancient order the
master indeed is gone but the old man fell a victim to his own temerity
and hardihood it is thirty years since he retired with three wounds
from the field of braddock but time in no degree abated his adventurous
and military spirit on the first alarm he summoned his neighbours and
led them in pursuit of the invaders alas he was the first to attack
them and the only one who fell in the contest

these words were uttered in a manner that left me no room to doubt of
their truth my uncle had already been lamented and the discovery of
the nature of his death so contrary to my forebodings and of the
safety of my girls made the state of my mind partake more of exultation
and joy than of grief or regret

but how was i deceived had not my fusil been found in the hands of an
enemy whence could he have plundered it but from my own chamber it
hung against the wall of a closet from which no stranger could have
taken it except by violence my perplexities and doubts were not at an
end but those which constituted my chief torment were removed i
listened to my friend's entreaties to tell him the cause of my
elopement and the incidents that terminated in the present interview

i began with relating my return to consciousness in the bottom of the
pit my efforts to free myself from this abhorred prison the acts of
horror to which i was impelled by famine and their excruciating
consequences my gaining the outlet of the cavern the desperate
expedient by which i removed the impediment to my escape and the
deliverance of the captive girl the contest i maintained before deb's
hut my subsequent wanderings the banquet which hospitality afforded
me my journey to the river-bank my meditations on the means of
reaching the road my motives for hazarding my life by plunging into the
stream and my subsequent perils and fears till i reached the threshold
of this habitation

thus continued i i have complied with your request i have told all
that i myself know what were the incidents between my sinking to rest
at my uncle's and my awaking in the chambers of the hill by what means
and by whose contrivance preternatural or human this transition was
effected i am unable to explain i cannot even guess

what has eluded my sagacity may not be beyond the reach of another
your own reflections on my tale or some facts that have fallen under
your notice may enable you to furnish a solution but meanwhile how
am i to account for your appearance on this spot this meeting was
unexpected and abrupt to you but it has not been less so to me of all
mankind sarsefield was the furthest from my thoughts when i saw these
tokens of a traveller and a stranger

you were imperfectly acquainted with my wanderings you saw me on the
ground before deb's hut you saw me plunge into the river you
endeavoured to destroy me while swimming and you knew before my
narrative was heard that huntly was the object of your enmity what was
the motive of your search in the desert and how were you apprized of my
condition these things are not less wonderful that any of those which i
have already related

during my tale the features of sarsefield betokened the deepest
attention his eye strayed not a moment from my face all my perils and
forebodings were fresh in my remembrance they had scarcely gone by
their skirts so to speak were still visible no wonder that my
eloquence was vivid and pathetic that i portrayed the past as if it
were the present scene and that not my tongue only but every muscle
and limb spoke

when i had finished my relation sarsefield sank into thoughtfulness
from this after a time he recovered and said your tale huntly is
true yet did i not see you before me were i not acquainted with the
artlessness and rectitude of your character and above all had not my
own experience during the last three days confirmed every incident i
should question its truth you have amply gratified my curiosity and
deserve that your own should be gratified as fully listen to me

much has happened since we parted which shall not be now mentioned i
promised to inform you of my welfare by letter and did not fail to
write but whether my letters were received or any were written by you
in return or if written were ever transmitted i cannot tell none were
ever received

some days since i arrived in company with a lady who is my wife in
america you have never been forgotten by me i knew your situation to
be little in agreement with your wishes and one of the benefits which
fortune has lately conferred upon me is the power of snatching you from
a life of labour and obscurity whose goods scanty as they are were
transient and precarious and affording you the suitable leisure and
means of intellectual gratification and improvement

your silence made me entertain some doubts concerning your welfare and
even your existence to solve these doubts i hastened to solesbury
some delays upon the road hindered me from accomplishing my journey by
daylight it was night before i entered the norwalk path but my ancient
rambles with you made me familiar with it and i was not afraid of being
obstructed or bewildered

just as i gained the southern outlet i spied a passenger on foot
coming towards me with a quick pace the incident was of no moment and
yet the time of night the seeming expedition of the walker
recollection of the mazes and obstacles which he was going to encounter
and a vague conjecture that perhaps he was unacquainted with the
difficulties that awaited him made me eye him with attention as he
passed

he came near and i thought i recognised a friend in this traveller
the form the gesture the stature bore a powerful resemblance to those
of edgar huntly this resemblance was so strong that i stopped and
after he had gone by called him by your name that no notice was taken
of my call proved that the person was mistaken but even though it were
another that he should not even hesitate or turn at a summons which he
could not but perceive to be addressed though erroneously to him was
the source of some surprise i did not repeat my call but proceeded on
my way

all had retired to repose in your uncle's dwelling i did not scruple
to rouse them and was received with affectionate and joyous greetings
that you allowed your uncle to rise before you was a new topic of
reflection to my inquiries concerning you answers were made that
accorded with my wishes i was told that you were in good health and
were then in bed that you had not heard and risen at my knocking was
mentioned with surprise but your uncle accounted for your indolence by
saying that during the last week you had fatigued yourself by rambling
night and day in search of some maniac or visionary who was supposed to
have retreated into norwalk

i insisted upon awakening you myself i anticipated the effect of this
sudden and unlooked-for meeting with some emotions of pride as well as
of pleasure to find in opening your eyes your old preceptor standing
by your bedside and gazing in your face would place you i conceived
in an affecting situation

your chamber-door was open but your bed was empty your uncle and
sisters were made acquainted with this circumstance their surprise gave
way to conjectures that your restless and romantic spirit had tempted
you from your repose that you had rambled abroad on some fantastic
errand and would probably return before the dawn i willingly
acquiesced in this opinion and my feelings being too thoroughly
aroused to allow me to sleep i took possession of your chamber and
patiently awaited your return

the morning returned but huntly made not his appearance your uncle
became somewhat uneasy at this unseasonable absence much speculation
and inquiry as to the possible reasons of your flight was made in my
survey of your chamber i noted that only part of your clothing remained
beside your bed coat hat stockings and shoes lay upon the spot where
they had probably been thrown when you had disrobed yourself but the
pantaloons which according to mr huntly's report completed your
dress were nowhere to be found that you should go forth on so cold a
night so slenderly apparelled was almost incredible your reason or
your senses had deserted you before so rash an action could be
meditated

i now remembered the person i had met in norwalk his resemblance to
your figure his garb which wanted hat coat stockings and shoes and
your absence from your bed at that hour were remarkable coincidences
but why did you disregard my call your name uttered by a voice that
could not be unknown was surely sufficient to arrest your steps

each hour added to the impatience of your friends to their
recollections and conjectures i listened with a view to extract from
them some solution of this mystery at length a story was alluded to of
some one who on the preceding night had been heard walking in the long
room to this was added the tale of your anxieties and wonders
occasioned by the loss of certain manuscripts

while ruminating upon these incidents and endeavouring to extract from
this intelligence a clue explanatory of your present situation a single
word casually dropped by your uncle instantly illuminated my darkness
and dispelled my doubts after all said the old man ten to one but
edgar himself was the man whom we heard walking but the lad was asleep
and knew not what he was about

surely said i this inference is just his manuscripts could not be
removed by any hands but his own since the rest of mankind were
unacquainted not only with the place of their concealment but with
their existence none but a man insane or asleep would wander forth so
slightly dressed and none but a sleeper would have disregarded my
calls this conclusion was generally adopted but it gave birth in my
mind to infinite inquietudes you had roved into norwalk a scene of
inequalities of prominences and pits among which thus destitute of
the guidance of your senses you could scarcely fail to be destroyed
or at least irretrievably bewildered i painted to myself the dangers
to which you were subjected your careless feet would bear you into some
whirlpool or to the edge of some precipice some internal revolution or
outward shock would recall you to consciousness at some perilous moment
surprise and fear would disable you from taking seasonable or suitable
precautions and your destruction be made sure

the lapse of every new hour without bringing tidings of your state
enhanced these fears at length the propriety of searching for you
occurred mr huntly and i determined to set out upon this pursuit as
well as to commission others a plan was laid by which every accessible
part of norwalk the wilderness beyond the flats of solesbury and the
valley of chetasco should be traversed and explored

scarcely had we equipped ourselves for this expedition when a
messenger arrived who brought the disastrous news of indians being seen
within these precincts and on the last night a farmer was shot in his
fields a dwelling in chetasco was burnt to the ground and its
inhabitants murdered or made captives rumour and inquiry had been busy
and a plausible conjecture had been formed as to the course and number
of the enemies they were said to be divided into bands and to amount
in the whole to thirty or forty warriors this messenger had come to
warn us of danger which might impend and to summon us to join in the
pursuit and extirpation of these detestable foes

your uncle whose alacrity and vigour age had not abated eagerly
engaged in this scheme i was not averse to contribute my efforts to an
end like this the road which we had previously designed to take in
search of my fugitive pupil was the same by which we must trace or
intercept the retreat of the savages thus two purposes equally
momentous would be answered by the same means

mr huntly armed himself with your fusil inglefield supplied me with a
gun during our absence the dwelling was closed and locked and your
sisters placed under the protection of inglefield whose age and pacific
sentiments unfitted him for arduous and sanguinary enterprises a troop
of rustics was collected half of whom remained to traverse solesbury
and the other whom mr huntly and i accompanied hastened to chetasco




chapter xxv


it was noonday before we reached the theatre of action fear and
revenge combined to make the people of chetasco diligent and zealous in
their own defence the havoc already committed had been mournful to
prevent a repetition of the same calamities they resolved to hunt out
the hostile footsteps and exact a merciless retribution

it was likely that the enemy on the approach of day had withdrawn
from the valley and concealed themselves in the thickets between the
parallel ridges of the mountain this space which according to the
object with which it is compared is either a vale or the top of a hill
was obscure and desolate it was undoubtedly the avenue by which the
robbers had issued forth and by which they would escape to the ohio
here they might still remain intending to emerge from their concealment
on the next night and perpetrate new horrors

a certain distribution was made of our number so as to move in all
directions at the same time i will not dwell upon particulars it will
suffice to say that keen eyes and indefatigable feet brought us at last
to the presence of the largest number of these marauders seven of them
were slain by the edge of a brook where they sat wholly unconscious of
the danger which hung over them five escaped and one of these secured
his retreat by wresting your fusil from your uncle and shooting him
dead before our companion could be rescued or revenged the assassin
with the remnant of the troop disappeared and bore away with him the
fusil as a trophy of his victory

this disaster was deplored not only on account of that life which had
thus been sacrificed but because a sagacious guide and intrepid leader
was lost his acquaintance with the habits of the indians and his
experience in their wars made him trace their footsteps with more
certainty than any of his associates

the pursuit was still continued and parties were so stationed that the
escape of the enemy was difficult if not impossible our search was
unremitted but during twelve or fourteen hours unsuccessful queen
mab did not elude all suspicion her hut was visited by different
parties but the old woman and her dogs had disappeared

meanwhile your situation was not forgotten every one was charged to
explore your footsteps as well as those of the savages but this search
was no less unsuccessful than the former none had heard of you or seen
you

this continued till midnight three of us made a pause at a brook and
intended to repair our fatigues by a respite of a few hours but
scarcely had we stretched ourselves on the ground when we were alarmed
by a shot which seemed to have been fired at a short distance we
started on our feet and consulted with each other on the measures to be
taken a second a third and a fourth shot from the same quarter
excited our attention anew mab's hut was known to stand at the distance
and in the direction of this sound and thither we resolved to repair

this was done with speed but with the utmost circumspection we
shortly gained the road that leads near this hut and at length gained a
view of the building many persons were discovered in a sort of
bustling inactivity before the hut they were easily distinguished to
be friends and were therefore approached without scruple

the objects that presented themselves to a nearer view were five bodies
stretched upon the ground three of them were savages the fourth was a
girl who though alive seemed to have received a mortal wound the
fifth breathless and mangled and his features almost concealed by the
blood that overspread his face was edgar the fugitive for whom i had
made such anxious search

about the same hour on the last night i had met you hastening into
norwalk now were you lying in the midst of savages at the distance of
thirty miles from your home and in a spot which it was impossible for
you to have reached unless by an immense circuit over rocks and
thickets that you had found a rift at the basis of a hill and thus
penetrated its solidities and thus precluded so tedious and circuitous
a journey as must otherwise have been made was not to be imagined

but whence arose this scene it was obvious to conclude that my
associates had surprised their enemies in this house and exacted from
them the forfeit of their crimes but how you should have been
confounded with their foes or whence came the wounded girl was a
subject of astonishment

you will judge how much this surprise was augmented when i was informed
that the party whom we found had been attracted hither by the same
signals by which we had been alarmed that on reaching this spot you had
been discovered alive seated on the ground and still sustaining the
gun with which you had apparently completed the destruction of so many
adversaries in a moment after their arrival you sunk down and expired

this scene was attended with inexplicable circumstances the musket
which lay beside you appeared to have belonged to one of the savages
the wound by which each had died was single of the four shots we had
distinguished at a distance three of them were therefore fatal to the
indians and the fourth was doubtless that by which you had fallen yet
three muskets only were discoverable

the arms were collected and the girl carried to the nearest house in
the arms of her father her situation was deemed capable of remedy and
the sorrow and wonder which i felt at your untimely and extraordinary
fate did not hinder me from endeavouring to restore the health of this
unfortunate victim i reflected likewise that some light might be
thrown upon transactions so mysterious by the information which might be
collected from her story numberless questions and hints were necessary
to extract from her a consistent or intelligible tale she had been
dragged it seems for miles at the heels of her conquerors who at
length stopped in a cavern for the sake of some repose all slept but
one who sat and watched something called him away and at the same
moment you appeared at the bottom of the cave half naked and without
arms you instantly supplied the last deficiency by seizing the gun and
tomahawk of him who had gone forth and who had negligently left his
weapons behind then stepping over the bodies of the sleepers you
rushed out of the cavern

she then mentioned your unexpected return her deliverance and flight
and arrival at deb's hut you watched upon the hearth and she fell
asleep upon the blanket from this sleep she was aroused by violent and
cruel blows she looked up you were gone and the bed on which she lay
was surrounded by the men from whom she had so lately escaped one
dragged her out of the hut and levelled his gun at her breast at the
moment when he touched the trigger a shot came from an unknown quarter
and he fell at her feet of subsequent events she had an incoherent
recollection the indians were successively slain and you came to her
and interrogated and consoled her

in your journey to the hut you were armed this in some degree
accounted for appearances but where were your arms three muskets only
were discovered and these undoubtedly belonged to your enemies

i now had leisure to reflect upon your destiny i had arrived soon
enough on this shore merely to witness the catastrophe of two beings
whom i most loved both were overtaken by the same fate nearly at the
same hour the same hand had possibly accomplished the destruction of
uncle and nephew

now however i began to entertain a hope that your state might not be
irretrievable you had walked and spoken after the firing had ceased and
your enemies had ceased to contend with you a wound had no doubt been
previously received i had hastily inferred that the wound was mortal
and that life could not be recalled occupied with attention to the
wailings of the girl and full of sorrow and perplexity i had admitted
an opinion which would have never been adopted in different
circumstances my acquaintance with wounds would have taught me to
regard sunken muscles lividness and cessation of the pulse as mere
indications of a swoon and not as tokens of death

perhaps my error was not irreparable by hastening to the hut i might
ascertain your condition and at least transport your remains to some
dwelling and finally secure to you the decencies of burial

of twelve savages discovered on the preceding day ten were now killed
two at least remained after whom the pursuit was still zealously
maintained attention to the wounded girl had withdrawn me from the
party and i had now leisure to return to the scene of these disasters
the sun had risen and accompanied by two others i repaired thither

a sharp turn in the road at the entrance of a field set before us a
startling spectacle an indian mangled by repeated wounds of bayonet
and bullet was discovered his musket was stuck in the ground by way
of beacon attracting our attention to the spot over this space i had
gone a few hours before and nothing like this was then seen the
parties abroad had hied away to a distant quarter some invisible power
seemed to be enlisted in our defence and to preclude the necessity of
our arms

we proceeded to the hut the savages were there but edgar had risen
and flown nothing now seemed to be incredible you had slain three
foes and the weapon with which the victory had been achieved had
vanished you had risen from the dead had assailed one of the surviving
enemies had employed bullet and dagger in his destruction with both of
which you could only be supplied by supernatural means and had
disappeared if any inhabitant of chetasco had done this we should have
heard of it

but what remained you were still alive your strength was sufficient
to bear you from this spot why were you still invisible and to what
dangers might you not be exposed before you could disinvolve yourself
from the mazes of this wilderness

once more i procured indefatigable search to be made after you it was
continued till the approach of evening and was fruitless inquiries
were twice made at the house where you were supplied with food and
intelligence on the second call i was astonished and delighted by the
tidings received from the good woman your person and demeanour and
arms were described and mention made of your resolution to cross the
southern ridge and traverse the solesbury road with the utmost
expedition

the greater part of my inquietudes were now removed you were able to
eat and to travel and there was little doubt that a meeting would take
place between us on the next morning meanwhile i determined to concur
with those who pursued the remainder of the enemy i followed you in
the path that you were said to have taken and quickly joined a numerous
party who were searching for those who on the last night had attacked
a plantation that lies near this and destroyed the inhabitants

i need not dwell upon our doublings and circuities the enemy was
traced to the house of selby they had entered they had put fire on the
floor but were compelled to relinquish their prey of what number they
consisted could not be ascertained but one lingering behind his
fellows was shot at the entrance of the wood and on the spot where
you chanced to light upon him

selby's house was empty and before the fire had made any progress we
extinguished it the drunken wretch whom you encountered had probably
returned from his nocturnal debauch after we had left the spot

the flying enemy was pursued with fresh diligence they were found by
various tokens to have crossed the river and to have ascended the
mountain we trod closely on their heels when we arrived at the
promontory described by you the fatigues of the night and day rendered
me unqualified to proceed i determined that this should be the bound of
my excursions i was anxious to obtain an interview with you and
unless i paused here should not be able to gain inglefield's as early
in the morning as i wished two others concurred with me in this
resolution and prepared to return to this house which had been
deserted by its tenants till the danger was past and which had been
selected as the place of rendezvous

at this moment dejected and weary i approached the ledge which
severed the headland from the mountain i marked the appearance of some
one stretched upon the ground where you lay no domestic animal would
wander hither and place himself upon this spot there was something
likewise in the appearance of the object that bespoke it to be man but
if it were man it was incontrovertibly a savage and a foe i
determined therefore to rouse you by a bullet

my decision was perhaps absurd i ought to have gained more certainty
before i hazarded your destruction be that as it will a moment's
lingering on your part would have probably been fatal you started on
your feet and fired see the hole which your random shot made through
my sleeve this surely was a day destined to be signalized by
hairbreadth escapes

your action seemed incontestably to confirm my prognostics every one
hurried to the spot and was eager to destroy an enemy no one hesitated
to believe that some of the shots aimed at you had reached their mark
and that you had sunk to rise no more

the gun which was fired and thrown down was taken and examined it had
been my companion in many a toilsome expedition it had rescued me and
my friends from a thousand deaths in order to recognise it i needed
only to touch and handle it i instantly discovered that i held in my
hand the fusil which i had left with you on parting with which your
uncle had equipped himself and which had been ravished from him by a
savage what was i hence to infer respecting the person of the last
possessor

my inquiries respecting you of the woman whose milk and bread you had
eaten were minute you entered she said with a hatchet and gun in
your hand while you ate the gun was laid upon the table she sat near
and the piece became the object of inquisitive attention the stock and
barrels were described by her in such terms as left no doubt that this
was the fusil

a comparison of incidents enabled me to trace the manner in which you
came into possession of this instrument one of those whom you found in
the cavern was the assassin of your uncle according to the girl's
report on issuing from your hiding-place you seized a gun that was
unoccupied and this gun chanced to be your own

its two barrels were probably the cause of your success in that unequal
contest at mab's hut on recovering from deliquium you found it where
it had been dropped by you out of sight and unsuspected by the party
that had afterwards arrived in your passage to the river had it once
more fallen into hostile hands or had you missed the way wandered to
this promontory and mistaken a troop of friends for a band of indian
marauders

either supposition was dreadful the latter was the most plausible no
motives were conceivable by which one of the fugitives could be induced
to post himself here in this conspicuous station whereas the road
which led you to the summit of the hill to that spot where descent to
the river-road was practicable could not be found but by those who were
accustomed to traverse it the directions which you had exacted from
your hostess proved your previous unacquaintance with these tracts

i acquiesced in this opinion with a heavy and desponding heart fate
had led us into a maze which could only terminate in the destruction of
one or of the other by the breadth of a hair had i escaped death from
your hand the same fortune had not befriended you after my tedious
search i had lighted on you forlorn bewildered perishing with cold
and hunger instead of recognising and affording you relief i compelled
you to leap into the river from a perilous height and had desisted
from my persecution only when i had bereaved you of life and plunged you
to the bottom of the gulf

my motives in coming to america were numerous and mixed among these
was the parental affection with which you had inspired me i came with
fortune and a better gift than fortune in my hand i intended to
bestow both upon you not only to give you competence but one who would
endear to you that competence who would enhance by participating
every gratification

my schemes were now at an end you were gone beyond the reach of my
benevolence and justice i had robbed your two sisters of a friend and
guardian it was some consolation to think that it was in my power to
stand with regard to them in your place that i could snatch them from
the poverty dependence and humiliation to which your death and that
of your uncle had reduced them

i was now doubly weary of the enterprise in which i was engaged and
returned with speed to this rendezvous my companions have gone to know
the state of the family who resided under this roof and left me to
beguile the tedious moments in whatever manner i pleased

i have omitted mentioning one incident that happened between the
detection of your flight and our expedition to chetasco having formed a
plausible conjecture as to him who walked in the long room it was
obvious to conclude that he who purloined your manuscript and the
walker was the same personage it was likewise easily inferred that the
letters were secreted in the cedar chest or in some other part of the
room instances similar to this have heretofore occurred men have
employed anxious months in search of that which in a freak of
noctambulation was hidden by their own hands

a search was immediately commenced and your letters were found
carefully concealed between the rafters and shingles of the roof in a
spot where if suspicion had not been previously excited they would
have remained till the vernal rains and the summer heats had insensibly
destroyed them this packet i carried with me knowing the value which
you set upon it and there being no receptacle equally safe but your own
cabinet which was locked

having as i said reached this house and being left alone i
bethought me of the treasure i possessed i was unacquainted with the
reasons for which these papers were so precious they probably had some
momentous and intimate connection with your own history as such they
could not be of little value to me and this moment of inoccupation and
regrets was as suitable as any other to the task of perusing them i
drew them forth therefore and laid them on the table in this chamber

the rest is known to you during a momentary absence you entered
surely no interview of ancient friends ever took place in so unexpected
and abrupt a manner you were dead i mourned for you as one whom i
loved and whom fate had snatched forever from my sight now in a
blissful hour you had risen and my happiness in thus embracing you is
tenfold greater than would have been experienced if no uncertainties and
perils had protracted our meeting




chapter xxvi


here ended the tale of sarsefield humiliation and joy were mingled in
my heart the events that preceded my awakening in the cave were now
luminous and plain what explication was more obvious what but this
solution ought to have been suggested by the conduct i had witnessed in
clithero

clithero was not this the man whom clithero had robbed of his friend
was not this the lover of mrs lorimer the object of the persecutions
of wiatte was it not now given me to investigate the truth of that
stupendous tale to dissipate the doubts which obstinately clung to my
imagination respecting it

but soft had not sarsefield said that he was married was mrs lorimer
so speedily forgotten by him or was the narrative of clithero the web
of imposture or the raving of insanity

these new ideas banished all personal considerations from my mind i
looked eagerly into the face of my friend and exclaimed in a dubious
accent how say you married when to whom

yes huntly i am wedded to the most excellent of women to her am i
indebted for happiness and wealth and dignity and honour to her do i
owe the power of being the benefactor and protector of you and your
sisters she longs to embrace you as a son to become truly her son will
depend upon your own choice and that of one who was the companion of
our voyage

heavens cried i in a transport of exultation and astonishment of
whom do you speak of the mother of clarice the sister of wiatte the
sister of the ruffian who laid snares for her life who pursued you and
the unhappy clithero with the bitterest animosity

my friend started at these sounds as if the earth had yawned at his
feet his countenance was equally significant of terror and rage as
soon as he regained the power of utterance he spoke clithero curses
light upon thy lips for having uttered that detested name thousands of
miles have i flown to shun the hearing of it is the madman here have
you set eyes upon him does he yet crawl upon the face of the earth
unhappy unparalleled unheard-of thankless miscreant has he told his
execrable falsehoods here has he dared to utter names so sacred as
those of euphemia lorimer and clarice

he has he has told a tale that had all the appearances of truth  

out upon the villain the truth truth would prove him to be unnatural
devilish a thing for which no language has yet provided a name he has
called himself unhappy no doubt a victim to injustice overtaken by
unmerited calamity say has he fooled thee with such tales

no his tale was a catalogue of crimes and miseries of which he was the
author and sufferer you know not his motives his horrors   

his deeds were monstrous and infernal his motives were sordid and
flagitious to display all their ugliness and infamy was not his
province no he did not tell you that he stole at midnight to the
chamber of his mistress a woman who astonished the world by her
loftiness and magnanimity by indefatigable beneficence and unswerving
equity who had lavished on this wretch whom she snatched from the
dirt all the goods of fortune all the benefits of education all the
treasures of love every provocation to gratitude every stimulant to
justice

he did not tell you that in recompense for every benefit he stole
upon her sleep and aimed a dagger at her breast there was no room for
flight or ambiguity or prevarication she whom he meant to murder
stood near saw the lifted weapon and heard him confess and glory in
his purposes

no wonder that the shock bereft her for a time of life the interval
was seized by the ruffian to effect his escape the rebukes of justice
were shunned by a wretch conscious of his inexpiable guilt these things
he has hidden from you and has supplied their place by a tale specious
as false

no among the number of his crimes hypocrisy is not to be numbered
these things are already known to me he spared himself too little in
the narrative the excellencies of his lady her claims to gratitude and
veneration were urged beyond their true bounds his attempts upon her
life were related it is true that he desired and endeavoured to destroy
her

how has he told you this

he has told me all alas the criminal intention has been amply
expiated

what mean you whence and how came he hither where is he now i will
not occupy the same land the same world with him have this woman and
her daughter lighted on the shore haunted by this infernal and
implacable enemy

alas it is doubtful whether he exists if he lives he is no longer to
be feared but he lives not famine and remorse have utterly consumed
him

famine remorse you talk in riddles

he has immured himself in the desert he has abjured the intercourse of
mankind he has shut himself in caverns where famine must inevitably
expedite that death for which he longs as the only solace of his woes
to no imagination are his offences blacker and more odious than to his
own i had hopes of rescuing him from this fate but my own infirmities
and errors have afforded me sufficient occupation

sarsefield renewed his imprecations on the memory of that unfortunate
man and his inquiries as to the circumstances that led him into this
remote district his inquiries were not to be answered by one in my
present condition my languors and fatigues had now gained a pitch that
was insupportable the wound in my face had been chafed and inflamed by
the cold water and the bleak air and the pain attending it would no
longer suffer my attention to stray i sunk upon the floor and
entreated him to afford me the respite of a few hours repose

he was sensible of the deplorableness of my condition and chid himself
for the negligence of which he had already been guilty he lifted me to
the bed and deliberated on the mode he should pursue for my relief
some mollifying application to my wound was immediately necessary but
in our present lonely condition it was not at hand it could only be
procured from a distance it was proper therefore to hasten to the
nearest inhabited dwelling which belonged to one by name walton and
supply himself with such medicines as could be found

meanwhile there was no danger of molestation and intrusion there was
reason to expect the speedy return of those who had gone in pursuit of
the savages this was their place of rendezvous and hither they
appointed to reassemble before the morrow's dawn the distance of the
neighbouring farm was small and sarsefield promised to be expeditious
he left me to myself and my own ruminations

harassed by fatigue and pain i had yet power to ruminate on that series
of unparalleled events that had lately happened i wept but my tears
flowed from a double source from sorrow on account of the untimely
fate of my uncle and from joy that my sisters were preserved that
sarsefield had returned and was not unhappy

i reflected on the untoward destiny of clithero part of his calamity
consisted in the consciousness of having killed his patroness but it
now appeared though by some infatuation i had not previously suspected
that the first impulse of sorrow in the lady had been weakened by
reflection and by time that the prejudice persuading her that her life
and that of her brother were to endure and to terminate together was
conquered by experience or by argument she had come in company with
sarsefield and clarice to america what influence might these events
have upon the gloomy meditations of clithero was it possible to bring
them together to win the maniac from his solitude wrest from him his
fatal purposes and restore him to communion with the beings whose
imagined indignation is the torment of his life

these musings were interrupted by a sound from below which was easily
interpreted into tokens of the return of those with whom sarsefield had
parted at the promontory voices were confused and busy but not
turbulent they entered the lower room and the motion of chairs and
tables showed that they were preparing to rest themselves after their
toils

few of them were unacquainted with me since they probably were
residents in this district no inconvenience therefore would follow
from an interview though on their part wholly unexpected besides
sarsefield would speedily return and none of the present visitants
would be likely to withdraw to this apartment

meanwhile i lay upon the bed with my face turned towards the door and
languidly gazing at the ceiling and walls just then a musket was
discharged in the room below the shock affected me mechanically and
the first impulse of surprise made me almost start upon my feet

the sound was followed by confusion and bustle some rushed forth and
called on each other to run different ways and the words that is
he stop him were spoken in a tone of eagerness and rage my
weakness and pain were for a moment forgotten and my whole attention
was bent to discover the meaning of this hubbub the musket which i had
brought with me to this chamber lay across the bed unknowing of the
consequences of this affray with regard to myself i was prompted by a
kind of self-preserving instinct to lay hold of the gun and prepare to
repel any attack that might be made upon me

a few moments elapsed when i thought i heard light footsteps in the
entry leading to this room i had no time to construe these signals
but watching fearfully the entrance i grasped my weapon with new
force and raised it so as to be ready at the moment of my danger i did
not watch long a figure cautiously thrust itself forward the first
glance was sufficient to inform me that this intruder was an indian
and of consequence an enemy he was unarmed looking eagerly on all
sides he at last spied me as i lay my appearance threw him into
consternation and after the fluctuation of an instant he darted to
the window threw up the sash and leaped out upon the ground

his flight might have been easily arrested by my shot but surprise
added to my habitual antipathy to bloodshed unless in cases of absolute
necessity made me hesitate he was gone and i was left to mark the
progress of the drama the silence was presently broken by firing at a
distance three shots in quick succession were followed by the deepest
pause

that the party recently arrived had brought with them one or more
captives and that by some sudden effort the prisoners had attempted to
escape was the only supposition that i could form by wrhat motives
either of them could be induced to seek concealment in my chamber could
not be imagined

i now heard a single step on the threshold below some one entered the
common room he traversed the floor during a few minutes and then
ascending the staircase he entered my chamber it was sarsefield
trouble and dismay were strongly written on his countenance he seemed
totally unconscious of my presence his eyes were fixed upon the floor
and as he continued to move across the room he heaved forth deep
sighs

this deportment was mournful and mysterious it was little in unison
with those appearances which he wore at our parting and must have been
suggested by some event that had since happened my curiosity impelled
me to recall him from his reverie i rose and seizing him by the arm
looked at him with an air of inquisitive anxiety it was needless to
speak

he noticed my movement and turning towards me spoke in a tone of some
resentment why did you deceive me did you not say clithero was
dead

i said so because it was my belief know you any thing to the contrary
heaven grant that he is still alive and that our mutual efforts may
restore him to peace

heaven grant replied my friend with a vehemence that bordered upon
fury heaven grant that he may live thousands of years and know not
in their long course a moment's respite from remorse and from anguish
but this prayer is fruitless he is not dead but death hovers over him
should he live he will live only to defy justice and perpetrate new
horrors my skill might perhaps save him but a finger shall not be
moved to avert his fate

little did i think that the wretch whom my friends rescued from the
power of the savages and brought wounded and expiring hither was
clithero they sent for me in haste to afford him surgical assistance i
found him stretched upon the floor below deserted helpless and
bleeding the moment i beheld him he was recognised the last of evils
was to look upon the face of this assassin but that evil is past and
shall never be endured again

rise and come with me accommodation is prepared for you at walcot's
let us leave this house and the moment you are able to perform a
journey abandon forever this district

i could not readily consent to this proposal clithero had been
delivered from captivity but was dying for want of that aid which
sarsefield was able to afford was it not inhuman to desert him in this
extremity what offence had he committed that deserved such implacable
vengeance nothing i had heard from sarsefield was in contradiction to
his own story his deed imperfectly observed would appear to be
atrocious and detestable but the view of all its antecedent and
accompanying events and motives would surely place it in the list not
of crimes but of misfortunes

but wrhat is that guilt which no penitence can expiate had not
clithero's remorse been more than adequate to crimes far more deadly and
enormous than this this however was no time to argue with the
passions of sarsefield nothing but a repetition of clithero's tale
could vanquish his prepossessions and mollify his rage but this
repetition was impossible to be given by me till a moment of safety and
composure

these thoughts made me linger but hindered me from attempting to change
the determination of my friend he renewed his importunities for me to
fly with him he dragged me by the arm and wavering and reluctant i
followed where he chose to lead he crossed the common room with
hurried steps and eyes averted from a figure which instantly fastened
my attention

it was indeed clithero whom i now beheld supine polluted with blood
his eyes closed and apparently insensible this object was gazed at
with emotions that rooted me to the spot sarsefield perceiving me
determined to remain where i was rushed out of the house and
disappeared




chapter xxvii


i hung over the unhappy wretch whose emaciated form and rueful features
sufficiently bespoke that savage hands had only completed that
destruction which his miseries had begun he was mangled by the tomahawk
in a shocking manner and there was little hope that human skill could
save his life

i was sensible of nothing but compassion i acted without design when
seating myself on the floor i raised his head and placed it on my
knees this movement awakened his attention and opening his eyes he
fixed them on my countenance they testified neither insensibility nor
horror nor distraction a faint emotion of surprise gave way to an
appearance of tranquillity having perceived these tokens of a state
less hopeless than i at first imagined i spoke to him my friend how
do you feel can any thing be done for you

he answered me in a tone more firm and with more coherence of ideas
than previous appearances had taught me to expect no said he thy
kindness good youth can avail me nothing the end of my existence here
is at hand may my guilt be expiated by the miseries that i have
suffered and my good deeds only attend me to the presence of my divine
judge

i am waiting not with trembling or dismay for this close of my
sorrows i breathed but one prayer and that prayer has been answered i
asked for an interview with thee young man but feeling as i now feel
this interview so much desired was beyond my hope now thou art come
in due season to hear the last words that i shall need to utter

i wanted to assure thee that thy efforts for my benefit were not
useless they have saved me from murdering myself a guilt more
inexpiable than any which it was in my power to commit

i retired to the innermost recess of norwalk and gained the summit of
a hill by subterranean paths this hill i knew to be on all sides
inaccessible to human footsteps and the subterranean passages were
closed up by stones here i believed my solitude exempt from
interruption and my death in consequence of famine sure

this persuasion was not taken away by your appearance on the opposite
steep the chasm which severed us i knew to be impassable i withdrew
from your sight

some time after awakening from a long sleep i found victuals beside
me he that brought it was invisible for a time i doubted whether some
messenger of heaven had not interposed for my salvation how other than
by supernatural means my retreat should be explored i was unable to
conceive the summit was encompassed by dizzy and profound gulfs and
the subterranean passages were still closed

this opinion though corrected by subsequent reflection tended to
change the course of my desperate thoughts my hunger thus
importunately urged would not abstain and i ate of the food that was
provided henceforth i determined to live to resume the path of
obscurity and labour which i had relinquished and wait till my god
should summon me to retribution to anticipate his call is only to
redouble our guilt

i designed not to return to inglefield's service but to choose some
other and remoter district meanwhile i had left in his possession a
treasure which my determination to die had rendered of no value but
which my change of resolution restored enclosed in a box at
inglefield's were the memoirs of euphemia lorimer by which in all my
vicissitudes i had been hitherto accompanied and from which i
consented to part only because i had refused to live my existence was
now to be prolonged and this manuscript was once more to constitute the
torment and the solace of my being

i hastened to inglefield's by night there was no need to warn him of
my purpose i desired that my fate should be an eternal secret to my
ancient master and his neighbours the apartment containing my box was
well known and easily accessible

the box was found but broken and rifled of its treasure my transports
of astonishment and indignation and grief yielded to the resumption
of my fatal purpose i hastened back to the hill and determined anew to
perish

this mood continued to the evening of the ensuing day wandering over
rocks and pits i discovered the manuscript lying under a jutting
precipice the chance that brought it hither was not less propitious and
miraculous than that by which i had been supplied with food it produced
a similar effect upon my feelings and while in possession of this
manuscript i was reconciled to the means of life i left the mountain
and traversing the wilderness stopped in chetasco that kind of
employment which i sought was instantly procured but my new vocation
was scarcely assumed when a band of savages invaded our security

rambling in the desert by moonlight i encountered these foes they
rushed upon me and after numerous wounds which for the present
neither killed nor disabled me they compelled me to keep pace with them
in their retreat some hours have passed since the troop was overtaken
and my liberty redeemed hardships and repeated wounds inflicted at
the moment when the invaders were surprised and slain have brought me
to my present condition i rejoice that my course is about to
terminate

here the speaker was interrupted by the tumultuous entrance of the party
by whom he had been brought hither their astonishment at seeing me
sustaining the head of the dying man may be easily conceived their
surprise was more strongly excited by the disappearance of the captive
whom they had left in this apartment bound hand and foot it now
appeared that of the savage troop who had adventured thus far in search
of pillage and blood all had been destroyed but two who had been led
hither as prisoners on their entrance into this house one of the party
had been sent to walcot's to summon sarsefield to the aid of the wounded
man while others had gone in search of cords to secure the arms and
legs of the captives who had hitherto been manacled imperfectly

the cords were brought and one of them was bound but the other before
the same operation was begun upon him broke by a sudden effort the
feeble ligatures by which he was at present constrained and seizing a
musket that lay near him fired on his enemies and then rushed out of
doors all eagerly engaged in the pursuit the savage was fleet as a
deer and finally eluded his pursuers

while their attention was thus engaged abroad he that remained found
means to extricate his wrists and ankles from his bonds and betaking
himself to the stairs escaped as i before described through the
window of the room which i had occupied they pestered me with their
curiosity and wonder for i was known to all of them but waiving the
discussion of my own concerns i entreated their assistance to carry
clithero to the chamber and the bed which i had just deserted

i now in spite of pain fatigue and watchfulness set out to go to
walton's sarsefield was ready to receive me at the door and the
kindness and compassion of the family were active in my behalf i was
conducted to a chamber and provided with suitable attendance and
remedies

i was not unmindful of the more deplorable condition of clithero i
incessantly meditated on the means for his relief his case stood in
need of all the vigilance and skill of a physician and sarsefield was
the only one of that profession whose aid could be seasonably
administered sarsefield therefore must be persuaded to bestow this
aid

there was but one mode of conquering his abhorrence of this man to
prepossess my friend with the belief of the innocence of clithero or to
soothe him into pity by a picture of remorse and suffering this could
be done and in the manner most conformable to truth by a simple
recital of the incidents that had befallen and by repeating the
confession which had been extorted from clithero

i requested all but my friend to leave my chamber and then soliciting
a patient hearing began the narrative of waldegrave's death of the
detection of clithero beneath the shade of the elm of the suspicions
which were thence produced and of the forest interview to which these
suspicions gave birth i then repeated without variation or addition
the tale which was then told i likewise mentioned my subsequent
transactions in norwalk so far as they illustrated the destiny of
clithero

during this recital i fixed my eyes upon the countenance of sarsefield
and watched every emotion as it arose or declined with the progress of
my tale his indignation and his fury grew less and at length gave
place to horror and compassion

his seat became uneasy his pulse throbbed with new vehemence when i
came to the motives which prompted the unhappy man to visit the chamber
of his mistress he started from his seat and sometimes strode across
the floor in a troubled mood and sometimes stood before me with his
breath almost suspended in the eagerness of his attention when i
mentioned the lifted dagger the shriek from behind and the apparition
that interposed he shuddered and drew back as if a dagger had been
aimed at his breast

when the tale was done some time elapsed in mutual and profound
silence my friend's thoughts were involved in a mournful and
indefinable reverie from this he at length recovered and spoke 

it is true a tale like this could never be the fruit of invention or
be invented to deceive he has done himself injustice his character was
spotless and fair all his moral properties seemed to have resolved
themselves into gratitude fidelity and honour

we parted at the door late in the evening as he mentioned and he
guessed truly that subsequent reflection had induced me to return and to
disclose the truth to mrs lorimer clarice relieved by the sudden
death of her friend and unexpectedly by all arrived at the same hour

these tidings astonished afflicted and delighted the lady her
brother's death had been long believed by all but herself to find her
doubts verified and his existence ascertained was the dearest
consolation that he ever could bestow she was afflicted at the proofs
that had been noted of the continuance of his depravity but she dreaded
no danger to herself from his malignity or vengeance

the ignorance and prepossessions of this woman were remarkable on this
subject only she was perverse headstrong obstinate her anxiety to
benefit this archruffian occupied her whole thoughts and allowed her no
time to reflect upon the reasonings or remonstrances of others she
could not be prevailed on to deny herself to his visits and i parted
from her in the utmost perplexity

a messenger came to me at midnight entreating my immediate presence
some disaster had happened but of what kind the messenger was unable to
tell my fears easily conjured up the image of wiatte terror scarcely
allowed me to breathe when i entered the house of mrs lorimer i was
conducted to her chamber she lay upon the bed in a state of
stupefaction that arose from some mental cause clarice sat by her
wringing her hands and pouring forth her tears without intermission
neither could explain to me the nature of the scene i made inquiries of
the servants and attendants they merely said that the family as usual
had retired to rest but their lady's bell rung with great violence and
called them in haste to her chamber where they found her in a swoon
upon the floor and the young lady in the utmost affright and
perturbation

suitable means being used mrs lorimer had at length recovered but
was still nearly insensible i went to clithero's apartments but he was
not to be found and the domestics informed me that since he had gone
with me he had not returned the doors between this chamber and the
court were open hence that some dreadful interview had taken place
perhaps with wiatte was an unavoidable conjecture he had withdrawn
however without committing any personal injury

i need not mention my reflections upon this scene all was tormenting
doubt and suspense till the morning arrived and tidings were received
that wiatte had been killed in the streets this event was antecedent to
that which had occasioned mrs lorimer's distress and alarm i now
remembered that fatal prepossession by which the lady was governed and
her frantic belief that her death and that of her brother were to fall
out at the same time could some witness of his death have brought her
tidings of it had he penetrated unexpected and unlicensed to her
chamber and were these the effects produced by the intelligence

presently i knew that not only wiatte was dead but that clithero had
killed him clithero had not been known to return and was nowhere to be
found he then was the bearer of these tidings for none but he could
have found access or egress without disturbing the servants

these doubts were at length at an end in a broken and confused manner
and after the lapse of some days the monstrous and portentous truth was
disclosed after our interview the lady and her daughter had retired to
the same chamber the former had withdrawn to her closet and the latter
to bed some one's entrance alarmed the lady and coming forth after a
moment's pause the spectacle which clithero has too faithfully
described presented itself

what could i think a life of uniform hypocrisy or a sudden loss of
reason were the only suppositions to be formed clithero was the parent
of fury and abhorrence in my heart in either case i started at the
name i shuddered at the image of the apostate or the maniac

what kill the brother whose existence was interwoven with that of his
benefactress and his friend then hasten to her chamber and attempt her
life lift a dagger to destroy her who had been the author of his being
and his happiness

he that could meditate a deed like this was no longer man an agent
from hell had mastered his faculties he was become the engine of
infernal malice against whom it was the duty of all mankind to rise up
in arms and never to desist till by shattering it to atoms its power
to injure was taken away

all inquiries to discover the place of his retreat were vain no
wonder methought that he wrapped himself in the folds of impenetrable
secrecy curbed checked baffled in the midst of his career no wonder
that he shrunk into obscurity that he fled from justice and revenge
that he dared not meet the rebukes of that eye which dissolving in
tenderness or flashing with disdain had ever been irresistible

but how shall i describe the lady's condition clithero she had
cherished from his infancy he was the stay the consolation the pride
of her life his projected alliance with her daughter made him still
more dear her eloquence was never tired of expatiating on his purity
and rectitude no wonder that she delighted in this theme for he was
her own work his virtues were the creatures of her bounty

how hard to be endured was this sad reverse she can be tranquil but
never more will she be happy to promote her forgetfulness of him i
persuaded her to leave her country which contained a thousand memorials
of past calamity and which was lapsing fast into civil broils clarice
has accompanied us and time may effect the happiness of others by her
means though she can never remove the melancholy of her mother

i have listened to your tale not without compassion what would you
have me to do to prolong his life would be merely to protract his
misery

he can never be regarded with complacency by my wife he can never be
thought of without shuddering by clarice common ills are not without a
cure less than death but here all remedies are vain consciousness
itself is the malady the pest of which he only is cured who ceases to
think

i could not but assent to this mournful conclusion yet though death
was better to clithero than life could not some of his mistakes be
rectified euphemia lorimer contrary to his belief was still alive he
dreamed that she was dead and a thousand evils were imagined to flow
from that death this death and its progeny of ills haunted his fancy
and added keenness to his remorse was it not our duty to rectify this
error

sarsefield reluctantly assented to the truth of my arguments on this
head he consented to return and afford the dying man the consolation
of knowing that the being whom he adored as a benefactor and parent had
not been deprived of existence though bereft of peace by his act

during sarsefield's absence my mind was busy in revolving the incidents
that had just occurred i ruminated on the last words of clithero there
was somewhat in his narrative that was obscure and contradictory he had
left the manuscript which he so much and so justly prized in his
cabinet he entered the chamber in my absence and found the cabinet
unfastened and the manuscript gone it was i by whom the cabinet was
opened but the manuscript supposed to be contained in it was buried in
the earth beneath the elm how should clithero be unacquainted with its
situation since none but clithero could have dug for it this grave

this mystery vanished when i reflected on the history of my own
manuscript clithero had buried his treasure with his own hands as mine
had been secreted by myself but both acts had been performed during
sleep the deed was neither prompted by the will nor noticed by the
senses of him by whom it was done disastrous and humiliating is the
state of man by his own hands is constructed the mass of misery and
error in which his steps are forever involved

thus it was with thy friend hurried on by phantoms too indistinct to be
now recalled i wandered from my chamber to the desert i plunged into
some unvisited cavern and easily proceeded till i reached the edge of a
pit there my step was deceived and i tumbled headlong from the
precipice the fall bereaved me of sense and i continued breathless and
motionless during the remainder of the night and the ensuing day

how little cognizance have men over the actions and motives of each
other how total is our blindness with regard to our own performances
who would have sought me in the bowels of this mountain ages might have
passed away before my bones would be discovered in this tomb by some
traveller whom curiosity had prompted to explore it

i was roused from these reflections by sarsefield's return inquiring
into clithero's condition he answered that the unhappy man was
insensible but that notwithstanding numerous and dreadful gashes in
different parts of his body it was possible that by submitting to the
necessary treatment he might recover

encouraged by this information i endeavoured to awaken the zeal and
compassion of my friend in clithero's behalf he recoiled with
involuntary shuddering from any task which would confine him to the
presence of this man time and reflection he said might introduce
different sentiments and feelings but at present he could not but
regard this person as a maniac whose disease was irremediable and
whose existence could not be protracted but to his own misery and the
misery of others

finding him irreconcilably averse to any scheme connected with the
welfare of clithero i began to think that his assistance as a surgeon
was by no means necessary he had declared that the sufferer needed
nothing more than common treatment and to this the skill of a score of
aged women in this district furnished with simples culled from the
forest and pointed out of old time by indian leeches was no
less adequate than that of sarsefield these women were ready and
officious in their charity and none of them were prepossessed against
the sufferer by a knowledge of his genuine story

sarsefield meanwhile was impatient for my removal to inglefield's
habitation and that venerable friend was no less impatient to receive
me my hurts were superficial and my strength sufficiently repaired by
a night's repose next day i went thither leaving clithero to the care
of his immediate neighbours

sarsefield's engagements compelled him to prosecute his journey into
virginia from which he had somewhat deviated in order to visit
solesbury he proposed to return in less than a month and then to take
me in his company to new york he has treated me with paternal
tenderness and insists upon the privilege of consulting for my interest
as if he were my real father meanwhile these views have been disclosed
to inglefield and it is with him that i am to remain with my sisters
until his return

my reflections have been various and tumultuous they have been busy in
relation to you to weymouth and especially to clithero the latter
polluted with gore and weakened by abstinence fatigue and the loss of
blood appeared in my eyes to be in a much more dangerous condition than
the event proved him to be i was punctually informed of the progress of
his cure and proposed in a few days to visit him the duty of
explaining the truth respecting the present condition of mrs lorimer
had devolved upon me by imparting this intelligence i hoped to work
the most auspicious revolutions in his feelings and prepared
therefore with alacrity for an interview

in this hope i was destined to be disappointed on the morning on which
i intended to visit him a messenger arrived from the house in which he
was entertained and informed us that the family on entering the sick
man's apartment had found it deserted it appeared that clithero had
during the night risen from his bed and gone secretly forth no traces
of his flight have since been discovered

but oh my friend the death of waldegrave thy brother is at length
divested of uncertainty and mystery hitherto i had been able to form
no conjecture respecting it but the solution was found shortly after
this time

queen mab three days after my adventure was seized in her hut on
suspicion of having aided and counselled her countrymen in their late
depredations she was not to be awed or intimidated by the treatment she
received but readily confessed and gloried in the mischief she had
done and accounted for it by enumerating the injuries which she had
received from her neighbours

these injuries consisted in contemptuous or neglectful treatment and in
the rejection of groundless and absurd claims the people of chetasco
were less obsequious to her humours than those of solesbury her ancient
neighbourhood and her imagination brooded for a long time over nothing
but schemes of revenge she became sullen irascible and spent more of
her time in solitude than ever

a troop of her countrymen at length visited her hut their intentions
being hostile they concealed from the inhabitants their presence in
this quarter of the country some motives induced them to withdraw and
postpone for the present the violence which they meditated one of
them however more sanguinary and audacious than the rest would not
depart without some gratification of his vengeance he left his
associates and penetrated by night into solesbury resolving to attack
the first human being whom he should meet it was the fate of thy
unhappy brother to encounter this ruffian whose sagacity made him
forbear to tear away the usual trophy from the dead lest he should
afford grounds for suspicion as to the authors of the evil

satisfied with this exploit he rejoined his companions and after an
interval of three weeks returned with a more numerous party to execute
a more extensive project of destruction they were counselled and
guided in all their movements by queen mab who now explained these
particulars and boldly defied her oppressors her usual obstinacy and
infatuation induced her to remain in her ancient dwelling and prepare to
meet the consequences

this disclosure awakened anew all the regrets and anguish which flowed
from that disaster it has been productive however of some benefit
suspicions and doubts by which my soul was harassed and which were
injurious to the innocent are now at an end it is likewise some
imperfect consolation to reflect that the assassin has himself been
killed and probably by my own hand the shedder of blood no longer
lives to pursue his vocation and justice is satisfied

thus have i fulfilled my promise to compose a minute relation of my
sufferings i remembered my duty to thee and as soon as i was able to
hold a pen employed it to inform thee of my welfare i could not at
that time enter into particulars but reserved a more copious narrative
till a period of more health and leisure

on looking back i am surprised at the length to which my story has run
i thought that a few days would suffice to complete it but one page has
insensibly been added to another till i have consumed weeks and filled
volumes here i will draw to a close i will send you what i have
written and discuss with you in conversation my other immediate
concerns and my schemes for the future as soon as i have seen
sarsefield i will visit you farewell e h

letter i

to mr sarsefield



philadelphia

i came hither but ten minutes ago and write this letter in the bar of
the stage-house i wish not to lose a moment in informing you of what
has happened i cannot do justice to my own feelings when i reflect upon
the rashness of which i have been guilty

i will give you the particulars to-morrow at present i shall only say
that clithero is alive is apprized of your wife's arrival and abode in
new york and has set out with mysterious intentions to visit her

may heaven avert the consequences of such a design may you be enabled
by some means to prevent their meeting if you cannot prevent it but i
must not reason on such an event nor lengthen out this letter

e h




letter ii

to the same



i will now relate the particulars which i yesterday promised to send
you you heard through your niece of my arrival at inglefield's in
solesbury my inquiries you may readily suppose would turn upon the
fate of my friend's servant clithero whose last disappearance was so
strange and abrupt and of whom since that time i had heard nothing
you are indifferent to his fate and are anxious only that his existence
and misfortunes may be speedily forgotten i confess that it is somewhat
otherwise with me i pity him i wish to relieve him and cannot admit
the belief that his misery is without a cure i want to find him out i
want to know his condition and if possible to afford him comfort and
inspire him with courage and hope

inglefield replied to my questions oh yes he has appeared the
strange being is again upon the stage shortly after he left his
sick-bed i heard from philip beddington of chetasco that deb's hut had
found a new tenant at first i imagined that the scotsman who built it
had returned but making closer inquiries i found that the new tenant
was my servant i had no inclination to visit him myself but frequently
inquired respecting him of those who lived or passed that way and find
that he still lives there

but how said i what is his mode of subsistence the winter has been
no time for cultivation and he found i presume nothing in the
ground

deb's hut replied my friend is his lodging and his place of
retirement but food and clothing he procures by labouring on a
neighbouring farm this farm is next to that of beddington who
consequently knows something of his present situation i find little or
no difference in his present deportment and those appearances which he
assumed while living with me except that he retires every night to his
hut and holds as little intercourse as possible with the rest of
mankind he dines at his employer's table but his supper which is
nothing but rye-bread he carries home with him and at all those times
when disengaged from employment he secludes himself in his hut or
wanders nobody knows whither

this was the substance of inglefield's intelligence i gleaned from it
some satisfaction it proved the condition of clithero to be less
deplorable and desperate than i had previously imagined his fatal and
gloomy thoughts seemed to have somewhat yielded to tranquillity

in the course of my reflections however i could not but perceive that
his condition though eligible when compared with what it once was was
likewise disastrous and humiliating compared with his youthful hopes
and his actual merits for such a one to mope away his life in this
unsocial and savage state was deeply to be deplored it was my duty if
possible to prevail on him to relinquish his scheme and what would be
requisite for that end but to inform him of the truth

the source of his dejection was the groundless belief that he had
occasioned the death of his benefactress it was this alone that could
justly produce remorse or grief it was a distempered imagination both
in him and in me that had given birth to this opinion since the terms
of his narrative impartially considered were far from implying that
catastrophe to him however the evidence which he possessed was
incontestable no deductions from probability could overthrow his
belief this could only be effected by similar and counter evidence to
apprize him that she was now alive in possession of some degree of
happiness the wife of sarsefield and an actual resident on this shore
would dissipate the sanguinary apparition that haunted him cure his
diseased intellects and restore him to those vocations for which his
talents and that rank in society for which his education had qualified
him influenced by these thoughts i determined to visit his retreat
being obliged to leave solesbury the next day i resolved to set out the
same afternoon and stopping in chetasco for the night seek his
habitation at the hour when he had probably retired to it

this was done i arrived at beddington's at nightfall my inquiries
respecting clithero obtained for me the same intelligence from him which
i had received from inglefield deb's hut was three miles from this
habitation and thither when the evening had somewhat advanced i
repaired this was the spot which had witnessed so many perils during
the last year and my emotions on approaching it were awful with
palpitating heart and quick steps i traversed the road skirted on each
side by thickets and the area before the house the dwelling was by no
means in so ruinous a state as when i last visited it the crannies
between the logs had been filled up and the light within was
perceivable only at a crevice in the door

looking through this crevice i perceived a fire in the chimney but the
object of my visit was nowhere to be seen i knocked and requested
admission but no answer was made at length i lifted the latch and
entered nobody was there

it was obvious to suppose that clithero had gone abroad for a short
time and would speedily return or perhaps some engagement had detained
him at his labour later than usual i therefore seated myself on some
straw near the fire which with a woollen rug appeared to constitute
his only bed the rude bedstead which i formerly met was gone the
slender furniture likewise which had then engaged my attention had
disappeared there was nothing capable of human use but a heap of fagots
in the corner which seemed intended for fuel how slender is the
accommodation which nature has provided for man and how scanty is the
portion which our physical necessities require

while ruminating upon this scene and comparing past events with the
objects before me the dull whistling of the gale without gave place to
the sound of footsteps presently the door opened and clithero entered
the apartment his aspect and guise were not essentially different from
those which he wore when an inhabitant of solesbury

to find his hearth occupied by another appeared to create the deepest
surprise he looked at me without any tokens of remembrance his
features assumed a more austere expression and after scowling on my
person for a moment he withdrew his eyes and placing in a corner a
bundle which he bore in his hand he turned and seemed preparing to
withdraw

i was anxiously attentive to his demeanour and as soon as i perceived
his purpose to depart leaped on my feet to prevent it i took his hand
and affectionately pressing it said do you not know me have you so
soon forgotten me who is truly your friend

he looked at me with some attention but again withdrew his eyes and
placed himself in silence on the seat which i had left i seated myself
near him and a pause of mutual silence ensued

my mind was full of the purpose that brought me hither but i knew not
in what manner to communicate my purpose several times i opened my lips
to speak but my perplexity continued and suitable words refused to
suggest themselves at length i said in a confused tone 

i came hither with a view to benefit a man with whose misfortunes his
own lips have made me acquainted and who has awakened in my breast the
deepest sympathy i know the cause and extent of his dejection i know
the event which has given birth to horror and remorse in his heart he
believes that by his means his patroness and benefactress has found an
untimely death

these words produced a visible shock in my companion which evinced that
i had at least engaged his attention i proceeded 

this unhappy lady was cursed with a wicked and unnatural brother she
conceived a disproportionate affection for this brother and erroneously
imagined that her fate was blended with his that their lives would
necessarily terminate at the same period and that therefore whoever
was the contriver of his death was likewise by a fatal and invincible
necessity the author of her own

clithero was her servant but was raised by her bounty to the station
of her son and the rank of her friend clithero in self-defence took
away the life of that unnatural brother and in that deed falsely but
cogently believed that he had perpetrated the destruction of his
benefactress

to ascertain the truth he sought her presence she was found the
tidings of her brother's death were communicated and she sank
breathless at his feet

at these words clithero started from the ground and cast upon me looks
of furious indignation and come you hither he muttered for this
end to recount my offences and drive me again to despair

no answered i with quickness i come to outroot a fatal but
powerful illusion i come to assure you that the woman with whose
destruction you charge yourself is not dead

these words uttered with the most emphatical solemnity merely produced
looks in which contempt was mingled with anger he continued silent

i perceive resumed i that my words are disregarded would to heaven
i were able to conquer your incredulity could show you not only the
truth but the probability of my tale can you not confide in me that
euphemia lorimer is now alive is happy is the wife of sarsefield that
her brother is forgotten and his murderer regarded without enmity or
vengeance

he looked at me with a strange expression of contempt come said he
at length make out thy assertion to be true fall on thy knees and
invoke the thunder of heaven to light on thy head if thy words be false
swear that euphemia lorimer is alive happy forgetful of wiatte and
compassionate of me swear that thou hast seen her talked with her
received from her own lips the confession of her pity for him who aimed
a dagger at her bosom swear that she is sarsefield's wife

i put my hands together and lifting my eyes to heaven exclaimed i
comply with your conditions i call the omniscient god to witness that
euphemia lorimer is alive that i have seen her with these eyes have
talked with her have inhabited the same house for months

these asseverations were listened to with shuddering he laid not aside
however an air of incredulity and contempt perhaps said he thou
canst point out the place of her abode canst guide me to the city the
street the very door of her habitation

i can she resides at this moment in the city of new york in broadway
in a house contiguous to the 

tis well exclaimed my companion in a tone loud abrupt and in the
utmost degree vehement tis well rash and infatuated youth thou hast
ratified beyond appeal or forgiveness thy own doom thou hast once
more let loose my steps and sent me on a fearful journey thou hast
furnished the means of detecting thy imposture i will fly to the spot
which thou describest i will ascertain thy falsehood with my own eyes
if she be alive then am i reserved for the performance of a new crime
my evil destiny will have it so if she be dead i shall make thee
expiate

so saying he darted through the door and was gone in a moment beyond
my sight and my reach i ran to the road looked on every side and
called but my calls were repeated in vain he had fled with the
swiftness of a deer

my own embarrassment confusion and terror were inexpressible his last
words were incoherent they denoted the tumult and vehemence of frenzy
they intimated his resolution to seek the presence of your wife i had
furnished a clue which could not fail to conduct him to her presence
what might not be dreaded from the interview clithero is a maniac this
truth cannot be concealed your wife can with difficulty preserve her
tranquillity when his image occurs to her remembrance what must it be
when he starts up before her in his neglected and ferocious guise and
armed with purposes perhaps as terrible as those which had formerly led
him to her secret chamber and her bedside

his meaning was obscurely conveyed he talked of a deed for the
performance of which his malignant fate had reserved him which was to
ensue their meeting and which was to afford disastrous testimony of the
infatuation which had led me hither

heaven grant that some means may suggest themselves to you of
intercepting his approach yet i know not what means can be conceived
some miraculous chance may befriend you yet this is scarcely to be
hoped it is a visionary and fantastic base on which to rest our
security

i cannot forget that my unfortunate temerity has created this evil yet
who could foresee this consequence of my intelligence i imagined that
clithero was merely a victim of erroneous gratitude a slave of the
errors of his education and the prejudices of his rank that his
understanding was deluded by phantoms in the mask of virtue and duty
and not as you have strenuously maintained utterly subverted

i shall not escape your censure but i shall likewise gain your
compassion i have erred not through sinister or malignant intentions
but from the impulse of misguided indeed but powerful benevolence




letter iii

to edgar huntly



new york

edgar 

after the fatigues of the day i returned home as i entered my wife
was breaking the seal of a letter but on seeing me she forbore and
presented the letter to me

i saw said she by the superscription of this letter who the writer
was so agreeably to your wishes i proceeded to open it but you have
come just time enough to save me the trouble

this letter was from you it contained information relative to clithero
see how imminent a chance it was that saved my wife from a knowledge of
its contents it required all my efforts to hide my perturbation from
her and excuse myself from showing her the letter

i know better than you the character of clithero and the consequences
of a meeting between him and my wife you may be sure that i would exert
myself to prevent a meeting

the method for me to pursue was extremely obvious clithero is a madman
whose liberty is dangerous and who requires to be fettered and
imprisoned as the most atrocious criminal

i hastened to the chief-magistrate who is my friend and by proper
representations obtained from him authority to seize clithero wherever
i should meet with him and effectually debar him from the perpetration
of new mischiefs

new york does not afford a place of confinement for lunatics as suitable
to his case as pennsylvania i was desirous of placing him as far as
possible from the place of my wife's residence fortunately there was a
packet for philadelphia on the point of setting out on her voyage this
vessel i engaged to wait a day or two for the purpose of conveying him
to pennsylvania hospital meanwhile proper persons were stationed at
powles hook and at the quays where the various stage-boats from jersey
arrive

these precautions were effectual not many hours after the receipt of
your intelligence this unfortunate man applied for a passage at
elizabethtown was seized the moment he set his foot on shore and was
forthwith conveyed to the packet which immediately set sail

i designed that all these proceedings should be concealed from the
women but unfortunately neglected to take suitable measures for
hindering the letter which you gave me reason to expect on the ensuing
day from coming into their hands it was delivered to my wife in my
absence and opened immediately by her

you know what is at present her personal condition you know what
strong reasons i had to prevent any danger or alarm from approaching
her terror could not assume a shape more ghastly than this the effects
have been what might have been easily predicted her own life has been
imminently endangered and an untimely birth has blasted my fondest
hope her infant with whose future existence so many pleasures were
entwined is dead

i assure you edgar my philosophy has not found itself lightsome and
active under this burden i find it hard to forbear commenting on your
rashness in no very mild terms you acted in direct opposition to my
counsel and to the plainest dictates of propriety be more circumspect
and more obsequious for the future

you knew the liberty that would be taken of opening my letters you knew
of my absence from home during the greatest part of the day and the
likelihood therefore that your letters would fall into my wife's hands
before they came into mine these considerations should have prompted
you to send them under cover to whitworth or harvey with directions to
give them immediately to me

some of these events happened in my absence for i determined to
accompany the packet myself and see the madman safely delivered to the
care of the hospital

i will not torture your sensibility by recounting the incidents of his
arrest and detention you will imagine that his strong but perverted
reason exclaimed loudly against the injustice of his treatment it was
easy for him to out-reason his antagonist and nothing but force could
subdue his opposition on me devolved the province of his jailer and his
tyrant a province which required a heart more steeled by spectacles of
suffering and the exercise of cruelty than mine had been

scarcely had we passed the narrows when the lunatic being suffered to
walk the deck as no apprehensions were entertained of his escape in
such circumstances threw himself overboard with a seeming intention
to gain the shore the boat was immediately manned the fugitive was
pursued but at the moment when his flight was overtaken he forced
himself beneath the surface and was seen no more

with the life of this wretch let our regrets and our forebodings
terminate he has saved himself from evils for which no time would have
provided a remedy from lingering for years in the noisome dungeon of a
hospital having no reason to continue my voyage i put myself on board
a coasting-sloop and regained this city in a few hours i persuade
myself that my wife's indisposition will be temporary it was impossible
to hide from her the death of clithero and its circumstances may this
be the last arrow in the quiver of adversity farewell



chapter i


i feel little reluctance in complying with your request you know not
fully the cause of my sorrows you are a stranger to the depth of my
distresses hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail yet
the tale that i am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your
sympathy in the midst of my despair i do not disdain to contribute
what little i can to the benefit of mankind i acknowledge your right to
be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family make
what use of the tale you shall think proper if it be communicated
to the world it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit it will
exemplify the force of early impressions and show the immeasurable
evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline

my state is not destitute of tranquillity the sentiment that dictates
my feelings is not hope futurity has no power over my thoughts to all
that is to come i am perfectly indifferent with regard to myself i
have nothing more to fear fate has done its worst henceforth i am
callous to misfortune

i address no supplication to the deity the power that governs the
course of human affairs has chosen his path the decree that ascertained
the condition of my life admits of no recal no doubt it squares with
the maxims of eternal equity that is neither to be questioned nor
denied by me it suffices that the past is exempt from mutation the
storm that tore up our happiness and changed into dreariness and desert
the blooming scene of our existence is lulled into grim repose but
not until the victim was transfixed and mangled till every obstacle was
dissipated by its rage till every remnant of good was wrested from our
grasp and exterminated

how will your wonder and that of your companions be excited by my
story every sentiment will yield to your amazement if my testimony
were without corroborations you would reject it as incredible the
experience of no human being can furnish a parallel that i beyond the
rest of mankind should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation
and without example listen to my narrative and then say what it is
that has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence if
indeed every faculty be not suspended in wonder that i am still alive
and am able to relate it my father's ancestry was noble on the paternal
side but his mother was the daughter of a merchant my grand-father was
a younger brother and a native of saxony he was placed when he had
reached the suitable age at a german college during the vacations
he employed himself in traversing the neighbouring territory on one
occasion it was his fortune to visit hamburg he formed an acquaintance
with leonard weise a merchant of that city and was a frequent guest
at his house the merchant had an only daughter for whom his guest
speedily contracted an affection and in spite of parental menaces and
prohibitions he in due season became her husband

by this act he mortally offended his relations thenceforward he was
entirely disowned and rejected by them they refused to contribute any
thing to his support all intercourse ceased and he received from them
merely that treatment to which an absolute stranger or detested enemy
would be entitled

he found an asylum in the house of his new father whose temper was
kind and whose pride was flattered by this alliance the nobility of
his birth was put in the balance against his poverty weise conceived
himself on the whole to have acted with the highest discretion in
thus disposing of his child my grand-father found it incumbent on him
to search out some mode of independent subsistence his youth had
been eagerly devoted to literature and music these had hitherto been
cultivated merely as sources of amusement they were now converted into
the means of gain at this period there were few works of taste in
the saxon dialect my ancestor may be considered as the founder of the
german theatre the modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same
family and perhaps surpasses but little in the fruitfulness of his
invention or the soundness of his taste the elder wieland his life
was spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces they were
not unpopular but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence he died
in the bloom of his life and was quickly followed to the grave by his
wife their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant
at an early age he was apprenticed to a london trader and passed seven
years of mercantile servitude

my father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care
he was now placed he was treated with rigor and full employment was
provided for every hour of his time his duties were laborious and
mechanical he had been educated with a view to this profession and
therefore was not tormented with unsatisfied desires he did not hold
his present occupations in abhorrence because they withheld him from
paths more flowery and more smooth but he found in unintermitted
labour and in the sternness of his master sufficient occasions for
discontent no opportunities of recreation were allowed him he spent
all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment or traversing narrow and
crowded streets his food was coarse and his lodging humble his heart
gradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection he could
not accurately define what was wanting to his happiness he was not
tortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that
of others his state was such as suited his age and his views as to
fortune he did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or
unjustifiable rigor in this respect he supposed the condition of
others bound like himself to mercantile service to resemble his own
yet every engagement was irksome and every hour tedious in its lapse

in this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of
the teachers of the albigenses or french protestants he entertained no
relish for books and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed
to delight or instruct this volume had lain for years in a corner of
his garret half buried in dust and rubbish he had marked it as it lay
had thrown it as his occasions required from one spot to another but
had felt no inclination to examine its contents or even to inquire what
was the subject of which it treated

one sunday afternoon being induced to retire for a few minutes to his
garret his eye was attracted by a page of this book which by some
accident had been opened and placed full in his view he was seated on
the edge of his bed and was employed in repairing a rent in some part
of his clothes his eyes were not confined to his work but occasionally
wandering lighted at length upon the page the words seek and ye
shall find were those that first offered themselves to his notice
his curiosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed
as soon as he finished his work he took up the book and turned to
the first page the further he read the more inducement he found to
continue and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him
for the present to close it

the book contained an exposition of the doctrine of the sect of
camissards and an historical account of its origin his mind was in a
state peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments the
craving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object his mind
was at no loss for a theme of meditation on days of business he rose
at the dawn and retired to his chamber not till late at night he now
supplied himself with candles and employed his nocturnal and sunday
hours in studying this book it of course abounded with allusions to
the bible all its conclusions were deduced from the sacred text this
was the fountain beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of
religious truth but it was his duty to trace it thus far

a bible was easily procured and he ardently entered on the study of it
his understanding had received a particular direction all his reveries
were fashioned in the same mould his progress towards the formation of
his creed was rapid every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed
through a medium which the writings of the camissard apostle had
suggested his constructions of the text were hasty and formed on a
narrow scale every thing was viewed in a disconnected position one
action and one precept were not employed to illustrate and restrict
the meaning of another hence arose a thousand scruples to which he had
hitherto been a stranger he was alternately agitated by fear and by
ecstacy he imagined himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe and
that his security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer

his morals which had never been loose were now modelled by a stricter
standard the empire of religious duty extended itself to his looks
gestures and phrases all levities of speech and negligences of
behaviour were proscribed his air was mournful and contemplative
he laboured to keep alive a sentiment of fear and a belief of
the awe-creating presence of the deity ideas foreign to this were
sedulously excluded to suffer their intrusion was a crime against the
divine majesty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keenest agonies

no material variation had occurred in the lapse of two years every day
confirmed him in his present modes of thinking and acting it was to
be expected that the tide of his emotions would sometimes recede that
intervals of despondency and doubt would occur but these gradually were
more rare and of shorter duration and he at last arrived at a state
considerably uniform in this respect

his apprenticeship was now almost expired on his arrival of age he
became entitled by the will of my grand-father to a small sum this
sum would hardly suffice to set him afloat as a trader in his present
situation and he had nothing to expect from the generosity of his
master residence in england had besides become almost impossible
on account of his religious tenets in addition to these motives for
seeking a new habitation there was another of the most imperious and
irresistable necessity he had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty
to disseminate the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations
he was terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which the life
of a missionary is exposed this cowardice made him diligent in the
invention of objections and excuses but he found it impossible wholly
to shake off the belief that such was the injunction of his duty
the belief after every new conflict with his passions acquired new
strength and at length he formed a resolution of complying with what
he deemed the will of heaven

the north-american indians naturally presented themselves as the first
objects for this species of benevolence as soon as his servitude
expired he converted his little fortune into money and embarked for
philadelphia here his fears were revived and a nearer survey of savage
manners once more shook his resolution for a while he relinquished his
purpose and purchasing a farm on schuylkill within a few miles of the
city set himself down to the cultivation of it the cheapness of land
and the service of african slaves which were then in general use
gave him who was poor in europe all the advantages of wealth he passed
fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner in this time new
objects new employments and new associates appeared to have nearly
obliterated the devout impressions of his youth he now became
acquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet disposition and of slender
acquirements like himself he proffered his hand and was accepted

his previous industry had now enabled him to dispense with personal
labour and direct attention to his own concerns he enjoyed leisure
and was visited afresh by devotional contemplation the reading of the
scriptures and other religious books became once more his favorite
employment his ancient belief relative to the conversion of the savage
tribes was revived with uncommon energy to the former obstacles were
now added the pleadings of parental and conjugal love the struggle
was long and vehement but his sense of duty would not be stifled or
enfeebled and finally triumphed over every impediment

his efforts were attended with no permanent success his exhortations
had sometimes a temporary power but more frequently were repelled with
insult and derision in pursuit of this object he encountered the most
imminent perils and underwent incredible fatigues hunger sickness
and solitude the licence of savage passion and the artifices of his
depraved countrymen all opposed themselves to his progress his courage
did not forsake him till there appeared no reasonable ground to hope for
success he desisted not till his heart was relieved from the supposed
obligation to persevere with his constitution somewhat decayed he at
length returned to his family an interval of tranquillity succeeded he
was frugal regular and strict in the performance of domestic duties
he allied himself with no sect because he perfectly agreed with none
social worship is that by which they are all distinguished but this
article found no place in his creed he rigidly interpreted that precept
which enjoins us when we worship to retire into solitude and shut
out every species of society according to him devotion was not only a
silent office but must be performed alone an hour at noon and an hour
at midnight were thus appropriated

at the distance of three hundred yards from his house on the top of a
rock whose sides were steep rugged and encumbered with dwarf cedars
and stony asperities he built what to a common eye would have seemed a
summer-house the eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above
the river which flowed at its foot the view before it consisted of a
transparent current fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel and
bounded by a rising scene of cornfields and orchards the edifice was
slight and airy it was no more than a circular area twelve feet in
diameter whose flooring was the rock cleared of moss and shrubs and
exactly levelled edged by twelve tuscan columns and covered by an
undulating dome my father furnished the dimensions and outlines but
allowed the artist whom he employed to complete the structure on his own
plan it was without seat table or ornament of any kind

this was the temple of his deity twice in twenty-four hours he repaired
hither unaccompanied by any human being nothing but physical inability
to move was allowed to obstruct or postpone this visit he did not exact
from his family compliance with his example few men equally sincere
in their faith were as sparing in their censures and restrictions
with respect to the conduct of others as my father the character of
my mother was no less devout but her education had habituated her to
a different mode of worship the loneliness of their dwelling prevented
her from joining any established congregation but she was punctual in
the offices of prayer and in the performance of hymns to her saviour
after the manner of the disciples of zinzendorf my father refused
to interfere in her arrangements his own system was embraced not
accurately speaking because it was the best but because it had been
expressly prescribed to him other modes if practised by other persons
might be equally acceptable

his deportment to others was full of charity and mildness a sadness
perpetually overspread his features but was unmingled with sternness or
discontent the tones of his voice his gestures his steps were all in
tranquil unison his conduct was characterised by a certain forbearance
and humility which secured the esteem of those to whom his tenets were
most obnoxious they might call him a fanatic and a dreamer but they
could not deny their veneration to his invincible candour and invariable
integrity his own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his
happiness this however was destined to find an end

suddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was deepened sighs
and even tears sometimes escaped him to the expostulations of his wife
he seldom answered any thing when he designed to be communicative he
hinted that his peace of mind was flown in consequence of deviation
from his duty a command had been laid upon him which he had delayed to
perform he felt as if a certain period of hesitation and reluctance
had been allowed him but that this period was passed he was no
longer permitted to obey the duty assigned to him was transferred in
consequence of his disobedience to another and all that remained was
to endure the penalty

he did not describe this penalty it appeared to be nothing more for
some time than a sense of wrong this was sufficiently acute and was
aggravated by the belief that his offence was incapable of expiation no
one could contemplate the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the
deepest compassion time instead of lightening the burthen appeared to
add to it at length he hinted to his wife that his end was near his
imagination did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decease but
was fraught with an incurable persuasion that his death was at hand he
was likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that awaited
him was strange and terrible his anticipations were thus far vague and
indefinite but they sufficed to poison every moment of his being and
devote him to ceaseless anguish



chapter ii


early in the morning of a sultry day in august he left mettingen to go
to the city he had seldom passed a day from home since his return from
the shores of the ohio some urgent engagements at this time existed
which would not admit of further delay he returned in the evening but
appeared to be greatly oppressed with fatigue his silence and dejection
were likewise in a more than ordinary degree conspicuous my mother's
brother whose profession was that of a surgeon chanced to spend this
night at our house it was from him that i have frequently received an
exact account of the mournful catastrophe that followed

as the evening advanced my father's inquietudes increased he sat with
his family as usual but took no part in their conversation he appeared
fully engrossed by his own reflections occasionally his countenance
exhibited tokens of alarm he gazed stedfastly and wildly at the
ceiling and the exertions of his companions were scarcely sufficient
to interrupt his reverie on recovering from these fits he expressed no
surprize but pressing his hand to his head complained in a tremulous
and terrified tone that his brain was scorched to cinders he would
then betray marks of insupportable anxiety

my uncle perceived by his pulse that he was indisposed but in no
alarming degree and ascribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his
mind he exhorted him to recollection and composure but in vain at the
hour of repose he readily retired to his chamber at the persuasion of
my mother he even undressed and went to bed nothing could abate his
restlessness he checked her tender expostulations with some sternness
be silent said he for that which i feel there is but one cure
and that will shortly come you can help me nothing look to your own
condition and pray to god to strengthen you under the calamities that
await you what am i to fear she answered what terrible disaster
is it that you think of peace as yet i know it not myself but come
it will and shortly she repeated her inquiries and doubts but he
suddenly put an end to the discourse by a stern command to be silent

she had never before known him in this mood hitherto all was benign in
his deportment her heart was pierced with sorrow at the contemplation
of this change she was utterly unable to account for it or to figure
to herself the species of disaster that was menaced

contrary to custom the lamp instead of being placed on the hearth was
left upon the table over it against the wall there hung a small clock
so contrived as to strike a very hard stroke at the end of every sixth
hour that which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to the
fane at which he addressed his devotions long habit had occasioned him
to be always awake at this hour and the toll was instantly obeyed

now frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock not a single
movement of the index appeared to escape his notice as the hour verged
towards twelve his anxiety visibly augmented the trepidations of my
mother kept pace with those of her husband but she was intimidated
into silence all that was left to her was to watch every change of his
features and give vent to her sympathy in tears

at length the hour was spent and the clock tolled the sound appeared
to communicate a shock to every part of my father's frame he rose
immediately and threw over himself a loose gown even this office
was performed with difficulty for his joints trembled and his teeth
chattered with dismay at this hour his duty called him to the rock and
my mother naturally concluded that it was thither he intended to repair
yet these incidents were so uncommon as to fill her with astonishment
and foreboding she saw him leave the room and heard his steps as they
hastily descended the stairs she half resolved to rise and pursue him
but the wildness of the scheme quickly suggested itself he was going
to a place whither no power on earth could induce him to suffer an
attendant

the window of her chamber looked toward the rock the atmosphere was
clear and calm but the edifice could not be discovered at that distance
through the dusk my mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain
where she was she rose and seated herself at the window she strained
her sight to get a view of the dome and of the path that led to it the
first painted itself with sufficient distinctness on her fancy but
was undistinguishable by the eye from the rocky mass on which it was
erected the second could be imperfectly seen but her husband had
already passed or had taken a different direction

what was it that she feared some disaster impended over her husband or
herself he had predicted evils but professed himself ignorant of what
nature they were when were they to come was this night or this hour
to witness the accomplishment she was tortured with impatience and
uncertainty all her fears were at present linked to his person and she
gazed at the clock with nearly as much eagerness as my father had done
in expectation of the next hour

an half hour passed away in this state of suspence her eyes were fixed
upon the rock suddenly it was illuminated a light proceeding from the
edifice made every part of the scene visible a gleam diffused itself
over the intermediate space and instantly a loud report like the
explosion of a mine followed she uttered an involuntary shriek but
the new sounds that greeted her ear quickly conquered her surprise
they were piercing shrieks and uttered without intermission the gleams
which had diffused themselves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn
but the interior of the edifice was filled with rays

the first suggestion was that a pistol was discharged and that the
structure was on fire she did not allow herself time to meditate a
second thought but rushed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door
of her brother's chamber my uncle had been previously roused by the
noise and instantly flew to the window he also imagined what he saw
to be fire the loud and vehement shrieks which succeeded the first
explosion seemed to be an invocation of succour the incident was
inexplicable but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of
hastening to the spot he was unbolting the door when his sister's
voice was heard on the outside conjuring him to come forth

he obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power he stopped not
to question her but hurried down stairs and across the meadow which lay
between the house and the rock the shrieks were no longer to be heard
but a blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of the
temple irregular steps hewn in the stone led him to the summit on
three sides this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff on the
fourth side which might be regarded as the front there was an area
of small extent to which the rude staircase conducted you my uncle
speedily gained this spot his strength was for a moment exhausted
by his haste he paused to rest himself meanwhile he bent the most
vigilant attention towards the object before him

within the columns he beheld what he could no better describe than
by saying that it resembled a cloud impregnated with light it had
the brightness of flame but was without its upward motion it did not
occupy the whole area and rose but a few feet above the floor no
part of the building was on fire this appearance was astonishing he
approached the temple as he went forward the light retired and when
he put his feet within the apartment utterly vanished the suddenness
of this transition increased the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold
degree fear and wonder rendered him powerless an occurrence like this
in a place assigned to devotion was adapted to intimidate the stoutest
heart

his wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him
his sight gradually recovered its power and he was able to discern my
father stretched on the floor at that moment my mother and servants
arrived with a lanthorn and enabled my uncle to examine more closely
this scene my father when he left the house besides a loose upper
vest and slippers wore a shirt and drawers now he was naked his skin
throughout the greater part of his body was scorched and bruised his
right arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by some heavy body
his clothes had been removed and it was not immediately perceived that
they were reduced to ashes his slippers and his hair were untouched

he was removed to his chamber and the requisite attention paid to his
wounds which gradually became more painful a mortification speedily
shewed itself in the arm which had been most hurt soon after the
other wounded parts exhibited the like appearance

immediately subsequent to this disaster my father seemed nearly in
a state of insensibility he was passive under every operation he
scarcely opened his eyes and was with difficulty prevailed upon to
answer the questions that were put to him by his imperfect account it
appeared that while engaged in silent orisons with thoughts full
of confusion and anxiety a faint gleam suddenly shot athwart the
apartment his fancy immediately pictured to itself a person bearing
a lamp it seemed to come from behind he was in the act of turning to
examine the visitant when his right arm received a blow from a heavy
club at the same instant a very bright spark was seen to light upon
his clothes in a moment the whole was reduced to ashes this was the
sum of the information which he chose to give there was somewhat in
his manner that indicated an imperfect tale my uncle was inclined to
believe that half the truth had been suppressed

meanwhile the disease thus wonderfully generated betrayed more
terrible symptoms fever and delirium terminated in lethargic slumber
which in the course of two hours gave place to death yet not till
insupportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his
chamber and the house every one whom their duty did not detain

such was the end of my father none surely was ever more mysterious
when we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety
the security from human malice which his character the place and the
condition of the times might be supposed to confer the purity and
cloudlessness of the atmosphere which rendered it impossible that
lightning was the cause what are the conclusions that we must form

the prelusive gleam the blow upon his arm the fatal spark the
explosion heard so far the fiery cloud that environed him without
detriment to the structure though composed of combustible materials
the sudden vanishing of this cloud at my uncle's approach what is the
inference to be drawn from these facts their truth cannot be doubted
my uncle's testimony is peculiarly worthy of credit because no man's
temper is more sceptical and his belief is unalterably attached to
natural causes

i was at this time a child of six years of age the impressions that
were then made upon me can never be effaced i was ill qualified to
judge respecting what was then passing but as i advanced in age and
became more fully acquainted with these facts they oftener became the
subject of my thoughts their resemblance to recent events revived them
with new force in my memory and made me more anxious to explain them
was this the penalty of disobedience this the stroke of a vindictive
and invisible hand is it a fresh proof that the divine ruler interferes
in human affairs meditates an end selects and commissions his agents
and enforces by unequivocal sanctions submission to his will or was
it merely the irregular expansion of the fluid that imparts warmth to
our heart and our blood caused by the fatigue of the preceding day or
flowing by established laws from the condition of his thoughts 


 a case in its symptoms exactly parallel to this is
 published in one of the journals of florence see likewise
 similar cases reported by messrs merille and muraire in
 the journal de medicine for february and may the
 researches of maffei and fontana have thrown some light upon
 this subject



chapter iii


the shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned to my mother was
the foundation of a disease which carried her in a few months to the
grave my brother and myself were children at this time and were now
reduced to the condition of orphans the property which our parents left
was by no means inconsiderable it was entrusted to faithful hands
till we should arrive at a suitable age meanwhile our education was
assigned to a maiden aunt who resided in the city and whose tenderness
made us in a short time cease to regret that we had lost a mother

the years that succeeded were tranquil and happy our lives were
molested by few of those cares that are incident to childhood by
accident more than design the indulgence and yielding temper of our
aunt was mingled with resolution and stedfastness she seldom deviated
into either extreme of rigour or lenity our social pleasures were
subject to no unreasonable restraints we were instructed in most
branches of useful knowledge and were saved from the corruption and
tyranny of colleges and boarding-schools

our companions were chiefly selected from the children of our
neighbours between one of these and my brother there quickly grew the
most affectionate intimacy her name was catharine pleyel she was rich
beautiful and contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with
the most exuberant vivacity the tie by which my brother and she were
united seemed to add force to the love which i bore her and which
was amply returned between her and myself there was every circumstance
tending to produce and foster friendship our sex and age were the same
we lived within sight of each other's abode our tempers were remarkably
congenial and the superintendants of our education not only prescribed
to us the same pursuits but allowed us to cultivate them together

every day added strength to the triple bonds that united us we
gradually withdrew ourselves from the society of others and found every
moment irksome that was not devoted to each other my brother's advance
in age made no change in our situation it was determined that his
profession should be agriculture his fortune exempted him from the
necessity of personal labour the task to be performed by him was
nothing more than superintendance the skill that was demanded by this
was merely theoretical and was furnished by casual inspection or
by closet study the attention that was paid to this subject did not
seclude him for any long time from us on whom time had no other effect
than to augment our impatience in the absence of each other and of
him our tasks our walks our music were seldom performed but in each
other's company

it was easy to see that catharine and my brother were born for each
other the passion which they mutually entertained quickly broke those
bounds which extreme youth had set to it confessions were made or
extorted and their union was postponed only till my brother had
passed his minority the previous lapse of two years was constantly and
usefully employed

o my brother but the task i have set myself let me perform with
steadiness the felicity of that period was marred by no gloomy
anticipations the future like the present was serene time was
supposed to have only new delights in store i mean not to dwell on
previous incidents longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain
the great events that have since happened the nuptial day at length
arrived my brother took possession of the house in which he was born
and here the long protracted marriage was solemnized

my father's property was equally divided between us a neat dwelling
situated on the bank of the river three quarters of a mile from my
brother's was now occupied by me these domains were called from the
name of the first possessor mettingen i can scarcely account for my
refusing to take up my abode with him unless it were from a disposition
to be an economist of pleasure self-denial seasonably exercised is
one means of enhancing our gratifications i was beside desirous of
administering a fund and regulating an household of my own the short
distance allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased the
walk from one mansion to the other was no undelightful prelude to our
interviews i was sometimes their visitant and they as frequently
were my guests

our education had been modelled by no religious standard we were left
to the guidance of our own understanding and the casual impressions
which society might make upon us my friend's temper as well as my own
exempted us from much anxiety on this account it must not be supposed
that we were without religion but with us it was the product of
lively feelings excited by reflection on our own happiness and by the
grandeur of external nature we sought not a basis for our faith in
the weighing of proofs and the dissection of creeds our devotion was
a mixed and casual sentiment seldom verbally expressed or solicitously
sought or carefully retained in the midst of present enjoyment
no thought was bestowed on the future as a consolation in calamity
religion is dear but calamity was yet at a distance and its only
tendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to
satisfy every craving

my brother's situation was somewhat different his deportment was grave
considerate and thoughtful i will not say whether he was indebted to
sublimer views for this disposition human life in his opinion was
made up of changeable elements and the principles of duty were not
easily unfolded the future either as anterior or subsequent to death
was a scene that required some preparation and provision to be made for
it these positions we could not deny but what distinguished him was a
propensity to ruminate on these truths the images that visited us were
blithsome and gay but those with which he was most familiar were of
an opposite hue they did not generate affliction and fear but they
diffused over his behaviour a certain air of forethought and sobriety
the principal effect of this temper was visible in his features and
tones these in general bespoke a sort of thrilling melancholy i
scarcely ever knew him to laugh he never accompanied the lawless mirth
of his companions with more than a smile but his conduct was the same
as ours

he partook of our occupations and amusements with a zeal not less than
ours but of a different kind the diversity in our temper was never
the parent of discord and was scarcely a topic of regret the scene
was variegated but not tarnished or disordered by it it hindered the
element in which we moved from stagnating some agitation and concussion
is requisite to the due exercise of human understanding in his studies
he pursued an austerer and more arduous path he was much conversant
with the history of religious opinions and took pains to ascertain
their validity he deemed it indispensable to examine the ground of
his belief to settle the relation between motives and actions the
criterion of merit and the kinds and properties of evidence

there was an obvious resemblance between him and my father in their
conceptions of the importance of certain topics and in the light in
which the vicissitudes of human life were accustomed to be viewed
their characters were similar but the mind of the son was enriched by
science and embellished with literature

the temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use from an italian
adventurer who erroneously imagined that he could find employment
for his skill and sale for his sculptures in america my brother had
purchased a bust of cicero he professed to have copied this piece from
an antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of modena of the
truth of his assertions we were not qualified to judge but the marble
was pure and polished and we were contented to admire the performance
without waiting for the sanction of connoisseurs we hired the same
artist to hew a suitable pedestal from a neighbouring quarry this was
placed in the temple and the bust rested upon it opposite to this was
a harpsichord sheltered by a temporary roof from the weather this was
the place of resort in the evenings of summer here we sung and talked
and read and occasionally banqueted every joyous and tender scene most
dear to my memory is connected with this edifice here the performances
of our musical and poetical ancestor were rehearsed here my brother's
children received the rudiments of their education here a thousand
conversations pregnant with delight and improvement took place and
here the social affections were accustomed to expand and the tear of
delicious sympathy to be shed

my brother was an indefatigable student the authors whom he read were
numerous but the chief object of his veneration was cicero he was
never tired of conning and rehearsing his productions to understand
them was not sufficient he was anxious to discover the gestures and
cadences with which they ought to be delivered he was very scrupulous
in selecting a true scheme of pronunciation for the latin tongue and in
adapting it to the words of his darling writer his favorite occupation
consisted in embellishing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of
gesticulation and utterance

not contented with this he was diligent in settling and restoring the
purity of the text for this end he collected all the editions and
commentaries that could be procured and employed months of severe study
in exploring and comparing them he never betrayed more satisfaction
than when he made a discovery of this kind

it was not till the addition of henry pleyel my friend's only brother
to our society that his passion for roman eloquence was countenanced
and fostered by a sympathy of tastes this young man had been some years
in europe we had separated at a very early age and he was now returned
to spend the remainder of his days among us

our circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a new member his
conversation abounded with novelty his gaiety was almost boisterous
but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment when the occasion
required it his discernment was acute but he was prone to view every
object merely as supplying materials for mirth his conceptions
were ardent but ludicrous and his memory aided as he honestly
acknowledged by his invention was an inexhaustible fund of
entertainment

his residence was at the same distance below the city as ours was above
but there seldom passed a day without our being favoured with a visit
my brother and he were endowed with the same attachment to the latin
writers and pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of the
history and metaphysics of religion their creeds however were in many
respects opposite where one discovered only confirmations of his faith
the other could find nothing but reasons for doubt moral necessity
and calvinistic inspiration were the props on which my brother thought
proper to repose pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty and
rejected all guidance but that of his reason their discussions were
frequent but being managed with candour as well as with skill they
were always listened to by us with avidity and benefit

pleyel like his new friends was fond of music and poetry henceforth
our concerts consisted of two violins an harpsichord and three voices
we were frequently reminded how much happiness depends upon society
this new friend though before his arrival we were sensible of no
vacuity could not now be spared his departure would occasion a void
which nothing could fill and which would produce insupportable regret
even my brother though his opinions were hourly assailed and even the
divinity of cicero contested was captivated with his friend and laid
aside some part of his ancient gravity at pleyel's approach



chapter iv


six years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away since my brother's
marriage the sound of war had been heard but it was at such a distance
as to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of comparison the
indians were repulsed on the one side and canada was conquered on the
other revolutions and battles however calamitous to those who occupied
the scene contributed in some sort to our happiness by agitating our
minds with curiosity and furnishing causes of patriotic exultation
four children three of whom were of an age to compensate by their
personal and mental progress the cares of which they had been at a
more helpless age the objects exercised my brother's tenderness the
fourth was a charming babe that promised to display the image of her
mother and enjoyed perfect health to these were added a sweet girl
fourteen years old who was loved by all of us with an affection more
than parental

her mother's story was a mournful one she had come hither from england
when this child was an infant alone without friends and without
money she appeared to have embarked in a hasty and clandestine
manner she passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunt's
protection and died a martyr to woe the source of which she could by
no importunities be prevailed upon to unfold her education and manners
bespoke her to be of no mean birth her last moments were rendered
serene by the assurances she received from my aunt that her daughter
should experience the same protection that had been extended to herself

on my brother's marriage it was agreed that she should make a part of
his family i cannot do justice to the attractions of this girl perhaps
the tenderness she excited might partly originate in her personal
resemblance to her mother whose character and misfortunes were
still fresh in our remembrance she was habitually pensive and this
circumstance tended to remind the spectator of her friendless condition
and yet that epithet was surely misapplied in this case this being was
cherished by those with whom she now resided with unspeakable fondness
every exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind her safety
was the object of a solicitude that almost exceeded the bounds of
discretion our affection indeed could scarcely transcend her merits
she never met my eye or occurred to my reflections without exciting
a kind of enthusiasm her softness her intelligence her equanimity
never shall i see surpassed i have often shed tears of pleasure at her
approach and pressed her to my bosom in an agony of fondness

while every day was adding to the charms of her person and the stores
of her mind there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us
of her an officer of some rank who had been disabled by a wound
at quebec had employed himself since the ratification of peace in
travelling through the colonies he remained a considerable period at
philadelphia but was at last preparing for his departure no one had
been more frequently honoured with his visits than mrs baynton a
worthy lady with whom our family were intimate he went to her house
with a view to perform a farewell visit and was on the point of taking
his leave when i and my young friend entered the apartment it is
impossible to describe the emotions of the stranger when he fixed his
eyes upon my companion he was motionless with surprise he was unable
to conceal his feelings but sat silently gazing at the spectacle before
him at length he turned to mrs baynton and more by his looks and
gestures than by words besought her for an explanation of the scene
he seized the hand of the girl who in her turn was surprised by his
behaviour and drawing her forward said in an eager and faultering
tone who is she whence does she come what is her name

the answers that were given only increased the confusion of his
thoughts he was successively told that she was the daughter of one
whose name was louisa conway who arrived among us at such a time who
sedulously concealed her parentage and the motives of her flight whose
incurable griefs had finally destroyed her and who had left this child
under the protection of her friends having heard the tale he melted
into tears eagerly clasped the young lady in his arms and called
himself her father when the tumults excited in his breast by this
unlooked-for meeting were somewhat subsided he gratified our curiosity
by relating the following incidents

miss conway was the only daughter of a banker in london who discharged
towards her every duty of an affectionate father he had chanced to fall
into her company had been subdued by her attractions had tendered her
his hand and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child his wife
had given him every proof of the fondest attachment her father who
possessed immense wealth treated him with distinguished respect
liberally supplied his wants and had made one condition of his consent
to their union a resolution to take up their abode with him

they had passed three years of conjugal felicity which had been
augmented by the birth of this child when his professional duty called
him into germany it was not without an arduous struggle that she was
persuaded to relinquish the design of accompanying him through all the
toils and perils of war no parting was ever more distressful they
strove to alleviate by frequent letters the evils of their lot those
of his wife breathed nothing but anxiety for his safety and impatience
of his absence at length a new arrangement was made and he was
obliged to repair from westphalia to canada one advantage attended this
change it afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family his
wife anticipated this interview with no less rapture than himself he
hurried to london and the moment he alighted from the stage-coach ran
with all speed to mr conway's house

it was an house of mourning his father was overwhelmed with grief and
incapable of answering his inquiries the servants sorrowful and mute
were equally refractory he explored the house and called on the names
of his wife and daughter but his summons was fruitless at length
this new disaster was explained two days before his arrival his wife's
chamber was found empty no search however diligent and anxious could
trace her steps no cause could be assigned for her disappearance the
mother and child had fled away together

new exertions were made her chamber and cabinets were ransacked but
no vestige was found serving to inform them as to the motives of her
flight whether it had been voluntary or otherwise and in what corner
of the kingdom or of the world she was concealed who shall describe the
sorrow and amazement of the husband his restlessness his vicissitudes
of hope and fear and his ultimate despair his duty called him to
america he had been in this city and had frequently passed the door of
the house in which his wife at that moment resided her father had not
remitted his exertions to elucidate this painful mystery but they had
failed this disappointment hastened his death in consequence of which
louisa's father became possessor of his immense property

this tale was a copious theme of speculation a thousand questions were
started and discussed in our domestic circle respecting the motives
that influenced mrs stuart to abandon her country it did not appear
that her proceeding was involuntary we recalled and reviewed every
particular that had fallen under our own observation by none of these
were we furnished with a clue her conduct after the most rigorous
scrutiny still remained an impenetrable secret on a nearer view major
stuart proved himself a man of most amiable character his attachment
to louisa appeared hourly to increase she was no stranger to the
sentiments suitable to her new character she could not but readily
embrace the scheme which was proposed to her to return with her father
to england this scheme his regard for her induced him however to
postpone some time was necessary to prepare her for so great a change
and enable her to think without agony of her separation from us

i was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to
relinquish this unwelcome design meanwhile he pursued his travels
through the southern colonies and his daughter continued with us
louisa and my brother frequently received letters from him which
indicated a mind of no common order they were filled with amusing
details and profound reflections while here he often partook of
our evening conversations at the temple and since his departure his
correspondence had frequently supplied us with topics of discourse

one afternoon in may the blandness of the air and brightness of the
verdure induced us to assemble earlier than usual in the temple
we females were busy at the needle while my brother and pleyel were
bandying quotations and syllogisms the point discussed was the merit of
the oration for cluentius as descriptive first of the genius of the
speaker and secondly of the manners of the times pleyel laboured to
extenuate both these species of merit and tasked his ingenuity to shew
that the orator had embraced a bad cause or at least a doubtful one
he urged that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate or to
make the picture of a single family a model from which to sketch the
condition of a nation was absurd the controversy was suddenly diverted
into a new channel by a misquotation pleyel accused his companion of
saying polliciatur when he should have said polliceretur nothing
would decide the contest but an appeal to the volume my brother was
returning to the house for this purpose when a servant met him with
a letter from major stuart he immediately returned to read it in our
company

besides affectionate compliments to us and paternal benedictions
on louisa his letter contained a description of a waterfall on the
monongahela a sudden gust of rain falling we were compelled to remove
to the house the storm passed away and a radiant moon-light succeeded
there was no motion to resume our seats in the temple we therefore
remained where we were and engaged in sprightly conversation the
letter lately received naturally suggested the topic a parallel was
drawn between the cataract there described and one which pleyel had
discovered among the alps of glarus in the state of the former some
particular was mentioned the truth of which was questionable to settle
the dispute which thence arose it was proposed to have recourse to the
letter my brother searched for it in his pocket it was no where to be
found at length he remembered to have left it in the temple and he
determined to go in search of it his wife pleyel louisa and myself
remained where we were

in a few minutes he returned i was somewhat interested in the dispute
and was therefore impatient for his return yet as i heard him
ascending the stairs i could not but remark that he had executed his
intention with remarkable dispatch my eyes were fixed upon him on his
entrance methought he brought with him looks considerably different
from those with which he departed wonder and a slight portion of
anxiety were mingled in them his eyes seemed to be in search of some
object they passed quickly from one person to another till they rested
on his wife she was seated in a careless attitude on the sofa in the
same spot as before she had the same muslin in her hand by which her
attention was chiefly engrossed

the moment he saw her his perplexity visibly increased he quietly
seated himself and fixing his eyes on the floor appeared to be
absorbed in meditation these singularities suspended the inquiry which
i was preparing to make respecting the letter in a short time the
company relinquished the subject which engaged them and directed their
attention to wieland they thought that he only waited for a pause in
the discourse to produce the letter the pause was uninterrupted by
him at length pleyel said well i suppose you have found the letter

no said he without any abatement of his gravity and looking
stedfastly at his wife i did not mount the hill why
not catharine have you not moved from that spot since i left the
room she was affected with the solemnity of his manner and laying
down her work answered in a tone of surprise no why do you ask that
question his eyes were again fixed upon the floor and he did not
immediately answer at length he said looking round upon us is it
true that catharine did not follow me to the hill that she did not just
now enter the room we assured him with one voice that she had not
been absent for a moment and inquired into the motive of his questions

your assurances said he are solemn and unanimous and yet i must
deny credit to your assertions or disbelieve the testimony of my
senses which informed me when i was half way up the hill that
catharine was at the bottom

we were confounded at this declaration pleyel rallied him with great
levity on his behaviour he listened to his friend with calmness but
without any relaxation of features

one thing said he with emphasis is true either i heard my
wife's voice at the bottom of the hill or i do not hear your voice at
present

truly returned pleyel it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced
yourself certain it is if our eyes can give us certainty that your
wife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence
you have heard her voice you say upon the hill in general her voice
like her temper is all softness to be heard across the room she is
obliged to exert herself while you were gone if i mistake not she did
not utter a word clara and i had all the talk to ourselves still it
may be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill but
tell us the particulars

the conference said he was short and far from being carried on in
a whisper you know with what intention i left the house half way to
the rock the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud i never
knew the air to be more bland and more calm in this interval i glanced
at the temple and thought i saw a glimmering between the columns it
was so faint that it would not perhaps have been visible if the moon
had not been shrowded i looked again but saw nothing i never visit
this building alone or at night without being reminded of the fate
of my father there was nothing wonderful in this appearance yet it
suggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same
place would have done

i kept on my way the images that haunted me were solemn and i
entertained an imperfect curiosity but no fear as to the nature of
this object i had ascended the hill little more than half way when a
voice called me from behind the accents were clear distinct powerful
and were uttered as i fully believed by my wife her voice is
not commonly so loud she has seldom occasion to exert it but
nevertheless i have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness
if my ear was not deceived it was her voice which i heard

stop go no further there is danger in your path the suddenness
and unexpectedness of this warning the tone of alarm with which it was
given and above all the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke
were enough to disconcert and make me pause i turned and listened to
assure myself that i was not mistaken the deepest silence succeeded at
length i spoke in my turn who calls is it you catharine i stopped
and presently received an answer yes it is i go not up return
instantly you are wanted at the house still the voice was
catharine's and still it proceeded from the foot of the stairs

what could i do the warning was mysterious to be uttered by catharine
at a place and on an occasion like these enhanced the mystery i could
do nothing but obey accordingly i trod back my steps expecting that
she waited for me at the bottom of the hill when i reached the
bottom no one was visible the moon-light was once more universal and
brilliant and yet as far as i could see no human or moving figure
was discernible if she had returned to the house she must have used
wondrous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye
i exerted my voice but in vain to my repeated exclamations no answer
was returned

ruminating on these incidents i returned hither there was no room
to doubt that i had heard my wife's voice attending incidents were not
easily explained but you now assure me that nothing extraordinary has
happened to urge my return and that my wife has not moved from her
seat

such was my brother's narrative it was heard by us with different
emotions pleyel did not scruple to regard the whole as a deception of
the senses perhaps a voice had been heard but wieland's imagination
had misled him in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife and
giving such a signification to the sounds according to his custom
he spoke what he thought sometimes he made it the theme of grave
discussion but more frequently treated it with ridicule he did not
believe that sober reasoning would convince his friend and gaiety he
thought was useful to take away the solemnities which in a mind like
wieland's an accident of this kind was calculated to produce

pleyel proposed to go in search of the letter he went and speedily
returned bearing it in his hand he had found it open on the pedestal
and neither voice nor visage had risen to impede his design

catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good sense but her
mind was accessible on this quarter to wonder and panic that her
voice should be thus inexplicably and unwarrantably assumed was a
source of no small disquietude she admitted the plausibility of the
arguments by which pleyel endeavoured to prove that this was no more
than an auricular deception but this conviction was sure to be shaken
when she turned her eyes upon her husband and perceived that pleyel's
logic was far from having produced the same effect upon him

as to myself my attention was engaged by this occurrence i could not
fail to perceive a shadowy resemblance between it and my father's death
on the latter event i had frequently reflected my reflections never
conducted me to certainty but the doubts that existed were not of a
tormenting kind i could not deny that the event was miraculous and
yet i was invincibly averse to that method of solution my wonder was
excited by the inscrutableness of the cause but my wonder was unmixed
with sorrow or fear it begat in me a thrilling and not unpleasing
solemnity similar to these were the sensations produced by the recent
adventure

but its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief moment
all that was desirable was that it should be regarded by him with
indifference the worst effect that could flow was not indeed very
formidable yet i could not bear to think that his senses should be the
victims of such delusion it argued a diseased condition of his frame
which might show itself hereafter in more dangerous symptoms the will
is the tool of the understanding which must fashion its conclusions
on the notices of sense if the senses be depraved it is impossible to
calculate the evils that may flow from the consequent deductions of the
understanding

i said this man is of an ardent and melancholy character those ideas
which in others are casual or obscure which are entertained in
moments of abstraction and solitude and easily escape when the scene is
changed have obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind the conclusions
which long habit has rendered familiar and in some sort palpable to
his intellect are drawn from the deepest sources all his actions and
practical sentiments are linked with long and abstruse deductions
from the system of divine government and the laws of our intellectual
constitution he is in some respects an enthusiast but is fortified
in his belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties

his father's death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct
and supernatural decree it visited his meditations oftener than it did
mine the traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent this new
incident had a visible effect in augmenting his gravity he was less
disposed than formerly to converse and reading when we sifted his
thoughts they were generally found to have a relation more or less
direct with this incident it was difficult to ascertain the exact
species of impression which it made upon him he never introduced the
subject into conversation and listened with a silent and half-serious
smile to the satirical effusions of pleyel

one evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple i seized that
opportunity of investigating the state of his thoughts after a pause
which he seemed in no wise inclined to interrupt i spoke to him how
almost palpable is this dark yet a ray from above would dispel it
ay said wieland with fervor not only the physical but moral night
would be dispelled but why said i must the divine will address
its precepts to the eye he smiled significantly true said he the
understanding has other avenues you have never said i approaching
nearer to the point you have never told me in what way you considered
the late extraordinary incident there is no determinate way in which
the subject can be viewed here is an effect but the cause is utterly
inscrutable to suppose a deception will not do such is possible but
there are twenty other suppositions more probable they must all be set
aside before we reach that point what are these twenty suppositions
it is needless to mention them they are only less improbable than
pleyel's time may convert one of them into certainty till then it is
useless to expatiate on them



chapter v


some time had elapsed when there happened another occurrence still more
remarkable pleyel on his return from europe brought information of
considerable importance to my brother my ancestors were noble saxons
and possessed large domains in lusatia the prussian wars had destroyed
those persons whose right to these estates precluded my brother's
pleyel had been exact in his inquiries and had discovered that by the
law of male-primogeniture my brother's claims were superior to those
of any other person now living nothing was wanting but his presence in
that country and a legal application to establish this claim

pleyel strenuously recommended this measure the advantages he thought
attending it were numerous and it would argue the utmost folly to
neglect them contrary to his expectation he found my brother averse
to the scheme slight efforts he at first thought would subdue his
reluctance but he found this aversion by no means slight the interest
that he took in the happiness of his friend and his sister and his own
partiality to the saxon soil from which he had likewise sprung and
where he had spent several years of his youth made him redouble his
exertions to win wieland's consent for this end he employed every
argument that his invention could suggest he painted in attractive
colours the state of manners and government in that country the
security of civil rights and the freedom of religious sentiments he
dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank and drew from the servile
condition of one class an argument in favor of his scheme since the
revenue and power annexed to a german principality afford so large a
field for benevolence the evil flowing from this power in malignant
hands was proportioned to the good that would arise from the virtuous
use of it hence wieland in forbearing to claim his own withheld all
the positive felicity that would accrue to his vassals from his success
and hazarded all the misery that would redound from a less enlightened
proprietor

it was easy for my brother to repel these arguments and to shew that no
spot on the globe enjoyed equal security and liberty to that which he
at present inhabited that if the saxons had nothing to fear from
mis-government the external causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and
manifest the recent devastations committed by the prussians furnished
a specimen of these the horrors of war would always impend over them
till germany were seized and divided by austrian and prussian tyrants
an event which he strongly suspected was at no great distance but
setting these considerations aside was it laudable to grasp at wealth
and power even when they were within our reach were not these the two
great sources of depravity what security had he that in this change
of place and condition he should not degenerate into a tyrant and
voluptuary power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of
their tendency to deprave the possessor he held them in abhorrence not
only as instruments of misery to others but to him on whom they
were conferred besides riches were comparative and was he not rich
already he lived at present in the bosom of security and luxury all
the instruments of pleasure on which his reason or imagination set any
value were within his reach but these he must forego for the sake of
advantages which whatever were their value were as yet uncertain in
pursuit of an imaginary addition to his wealth he must reduce himself
to poverty he must exchange present certainties for what was distant
and contingent for who knows not that the law is a system of expence
delay and uncertainty if he should embrace this scheme it would lay
him under the necessity of making a voyage to europe and remaining for
a certain period separate from his family he must undergo the perils
and discomforts of the ocean he must divest himself of all domestic
pleasures he must deprive his wife of her companion and his children
of a father and instructor and all for what for the ambiguous
advantages which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to bestow
for a precarious possession in a land of turbulence and war advantages
which will not certainly be gained and of which the acquisition if it
were sure is necessarily distant

pleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its intrinsic benefits
but likewise for other reasons his abode at leipsig made that country
appear to him like home he was connected with this place by many social
ties while there he had not escaped the amorous contagion but the
lady though her heart was impressed in his favor was compelled to
bestow her hand upon another death had removed this impediment and
he was now invited by the lady herself to return this he was of course
determined to do but was anxious to obtain the company of wieland
he could not bear to think of an eternal separation from his present
associates their interest he thought would be no less promoted by the
change than his own hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his
arguments and solicitations

he knew that he could not hope for mine or his sister's ready
concurrence in this scheme should the subject be mentioned to us we
should league our efforts against him and strengthen that reluctance
in wieland which already was sufficiently difficult to conquer he
therefore anxiously concealed from us his purpose if wieland were
previously enlisted in his cause he would find it a less difficult task
to overcome our aversion my brother was silent on this subject because
he believed himself in no danger of changing his opinion and he was
willing to save us from any uneasiness the mere mention of such
a scheme and the possibility of his embracing it he knew would
considerably impair our tranquillity

one day about three weeks subsequent to the mysterious call it was
agreed that the family should be my guests seldom had a day been passed
by us of more serene enjoyment pleyel had promised us his company but
we did not see him till the sun had nearly declined he brought with
him a countenance that betokened disappointment and vexation he did not
wait for our inquiries but immediately explained the cause two days
before a packet had arrived from hamburgh by which he had flattered
himself with the expectation of receiving letters but no letters had
arrived i never saw him so much subdued by an untoward event his
thoughts were employed in accounting for the silence of his friends
he was seized with the torments of jealousy and suspected nothing less
than the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his heart the silence
must have been concerted her sickness or absence or death would have
increased the certainty of some one's having written no supposition
could be formed but that his mistress had grown indifferent or that she
had transferred her affections to another the miscarriage of a letter
was hardly within the reach of possibility from leipsig to hamburgh
and from hamburgh hither the conveyance was exposed to no hazard

he had been so long detained in america chiefly in consequence of
wieland's aversion to the scheme which he proposed he now became more
impatient than ever to return to europe when he reflected that by his
delays he had probably forfeited the affections of his mistress his
sensations amounted to agony it only remained by his speedy departure
to repair if possible or prevent so intolerable an evil already he
had half resolved to embark in this very ship which he was informed
would set out in a few weeks on her return

meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to shake the resolution of
wieland the evening was somewhat advanced when he invited the latter
to walk abroad with him the invitation was accepted and they left
catharine louisa and me to amuse ourselves by the best means in our
power during this walk pleyel renewed the subject that was nearest
his heart he re-urged all his former arguments and placed them in more
forcible lights

they promised to return shortly but hour after hour passed and they
made not their appearance engaged in sprightly conversation it was not
till the clock struck twelve that we were reminded of the lapse of time
the absence of our friends excited some uneasy apprehensions we were
expressing our fears and comparing our conjectures as to what might be
the cause when they entered together there were indications in their
countenances that struck me mute these were unnoticed by catharine who
was eager to express her surprize and curiosity at the length of their
walk as they listened to her i remarked that their surprize was not
less than ours they gazed in silence on each other and on her i
watched their looks but could not understand the emotions that were
written in them

these appearances diverted catharine's inquiries into a new channel
what did they mean she asked by their silence and by their thus
gazing wildly at each other and at her pleyel profited by this hint
and assuming an air of indifference framed some trifling excuse at the
same time darting significant glances at wieland as if to caution him
against disclosing the truth my brother said nothing but delivered
himself up to meditation i likewise was silent but burned with
impatience to fathom this mystery presently my brother and his wife
and louisa returned home pleyel proposed of his own accord to be
my guest for the night this circumstance in addition to those which
preceded gave new edge to my wonder

as soon as we were left alone pleyel's countenance assumed an air of
seriousness and even consternation which i had never before beheld in
him the steps with which he measured the floor betokened the trouble of
his thoughts my inquiries were suspended by the hope that he would give
me the information that i wanted without the importunity of questions
i waited some time but the confusion of his thoughts appeared in no
degree to abate at length i mentioned the apprehensions which their
unusual absence had occasioned and which were increased by their
behaviour since their return and solicited an explanation he stopped
when i began to speak and looked stedfastly at me when i had done
he said to me in a tone which faultered through the vehemence of his
emotions how were you employed during our absence in turning over
the della crusca dictionary and talking on different subjects but
just before your entrance we were tormenting ourselves with omens and
prognosticks relative to your absence catherine was with you the
whole time yes but are you sure most sure she was not absent a
moment he stood for a time as if to assure himself of my sincerity
then clinching his hands and wildly lifting them above his head lo
cried he i have news to tell you the baroness de stolberg is dead

this was her whom he loved i was not surprised at the agitations which
he betrayed but how was the information procured how was the truth
of this news connected with the circumstance of catharine's remaining in
our company he was for some time inattentive to my questions when he
spoke it seemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had
been plunged

and yet it might be a mere deception but could both of us in that
case have been deceived a rare and prodigious coincidence barely not
impossible and yet if the accent be oracular theresa is dead no
no continued he covering his face with his hands and in a tone half
broken into sobs i cannot believe it she has not written but if
she were dead the faithful bertrand would have given me the earliest
information and yet if he knew his master he must have easily guessed
at the effect of such tidings in pity to me he was silent

clara forgive me to you this behaviour is mysterious i will explain
as well as i am able but say not a word to catharine her strength of
mind is inferior to your's she will besides have more reason to be
startled she is wieland's angel

pleyel proceeded to inform me for the first time of the scheme which
he had pressed with so much earnestness on my brother he enumerated
the objections which had been made and the industry with which he
had endeavoured to confute them he mentioned the effect upon his
resolutions produced by the failure of a letter during our late walk
continued he i introduced the subject that was nearest my heart
i re-urged all my former arguments and placed them in more forcible
lights wieland was still refractory he expatiated on the perils of
wealth and power on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties and
the happiness of mediocrity

no wonder that the time passed unperceived away our whole souls were
engaged in this cause several times we came to the foot of the rock
as soon as we perceived it we changed our course but never failed to
terminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this spot at length your
brother observed we seem to be led hither by a kind of fatality since
we are so near let us ascend and rest ourselves a while if you are not
weary of this argument we will resume it there

i tacitly consented we mounted the stairs and drawing the sofa in
front of the river we seated ourselves upon it i took up the thread of
our discourse where we had dropped it i ridiculed his dread of the sea
and his attachment to home i kept on in this strain so congenial with
my disposition for some time uninterrupted by him at length he said
to me suppose now that i whom argument has not convinced should
yield to ridicule and should agree that your scheme is eligible what
will you have gained nothing you have other enemies beside myself to
encounter when you have vanquished me your toil has scarcely begun
there are my sister and wife with whom it will remain for you to
maintain the contest and trust me they are adversaries whom all your
force and stratagem will never subdue i insinuated that they would
model themselves by his will that catharine would think obedience her
duty he answered with some quickness you mistake their concurrence
is indispensable it is not my custom to exact sacrifices of this kind
i live to be their protector and friend and not their tyrant and foe
if my wife shall deem her happiness and that of her children most
consulted by remaining where she is here she shall remain but said
i when she knows your pleasure will she not conform to it before
my friend had time to answer this question a negative was clearly and
distinctly uttered from another quarter it did not come from one side
or the other from before us or behind whence then did it come by
whose organs was it fashioned

if any uncertainty had existed with regard to these particulars it
would have been removed by a deliberate and equally distinct repetition
of the same monosyllable no the voice was my sister's it appeared
to come from the roof i started from my seat catharine exclaimed i
where are you no answer was returned i searched the room and the
area before it but in vain your brother was motionless in his seat
i returned to him and placed myself again by his side my astonishment
was not less than his

well said he at length what think you of this this is the
self-same voice which i formerly heard you are now convinced that my
ears were well informed

yes said i this it is plain is no fiction of the fancy we again
sunk into mutual and thoughtful silence a recollection of the hour and
of the length of our absence made me at last propose to return we
rose up for this purpose in doing this my mind reverted to the
contemplation of my own condition yes said i aloud but without
particularly addressing myself to wieland my resolution is taken i
cannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me they may doze
away their days on the banks of schuylkill but as to me i go in the
next vessel i will fly to her presence and demand the reason of this
extraordinary silence

i had scarcely finished the sentence when the same mysterious voice
exclaimed you shall not go the seal of death is on her lips her
silence is the silence of the tomb think of the effects which accents
like these must have had upon me i shuddered as i listened as soon as
i recovered from my first amazement who is it that speaks said i
whence did you procure these dismal tidings i did not wait long for
an answer from a source that cannot fail be satisfied she is dead
you may justly be surprised that in the circumstances in which i heard
the tidings and notwithstanding the mystery which environed him by whom
they were imparted i could give an undivided attention to the facts
which were the subject of our dialogue i eagerly inquired when and
where did she die what was the cause of her death was her death
absolutely certain an answer was returned only to the last of these
questions yes was pronounced by the same voice but it now sounded
from a greater distance and the deepest silence was all the return made
to my subsequent interrogatories

it was my sister's voice but it could not be uttered by her and yet
if not by her by whom was it uttered when we returned hither and
discovered you together the doubt that had previously existed was
removed it was manifest that the intimation came not from her yet if
not from her from whom could it come are the circumstances attending
the imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true god forbid
that they should be true

here pleyel sunk into anxious silence and gave me leisure to ruminate
on this inexplicable event i am at a loss to describe the sensations
that affected me i am not fearful of shadows the tales of apparitions
and enchantments did not possess that power over my belief which could
even render them interesting i saw nothing in them but ignorance and
folly and was a stranger even to that terror which is pleasing but
this incident was different from any that i had ever before known here
were proofs of a sensible and intelligent existence which could not
be denied here was information obtained and imparted by means
unquestionably super-human

that there are conscious beings beside ourselves in existence whose
modes of activity and information surpass our own can scarcely be
denied is there a glimpse afforded us into a world of these superior
beings my heart was scarcely large enough to give admittance to
so swelling a thought an awe the sweetest and most solemn that
imagination can conceive pervaded my whole frame it forsook me not
when i parted from pleyel and retired to my chamber an impulse was
given to my spirits utterly incompatible with sleep i passed the night
wakeful and full of meditation i was impressed with the belief of
mysterious but not of malignant agency hitherto nothing had occurred
to persuade me that this airy minister was busy to evil rather than to
good purposes on the contrary the idea of superior virtue had always
been associated in my mind with that of superior power the warnings
that had thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent
intentions my brother had been hindered by this voice from ascending
the hill he was told that danger lurked in his path and his obedience
to the intimation had perhaps saved him from a destiny similar to that
of my father

pleyel had been rescued from tormenting uncertainty and from the
hazards and fatigues of a fruitless voyage by the same interposition
it had assured him of the death of his theresa

this woman was then dead a confirmation of the tidings if true would
speedily arrive was this confirmation to be deprecated or desired
by her death the tie that attached him to europe was taken away
henceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native
country and we were rescued from the deep regrets that would accompany
his hopeless absence from us propitious was the spirit that imparted
these tidings propitious he would perhaps have been if he had been
instrumental in producing as well as in communicating the tidings of
her death propitious to us the friends of pleyel to whom has thereby
been secured the enjoyment of his society and not unpropitious to
himself for though this object of his love be snatched away is there
not another who is able and willing to console him for her loss

twenty days after this another vessel arrived from the same port in
this interval pleyel for the most part estranged himself from his old
companions he was become the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief
his walks were limited to the bank of the delaware this bank is an
artificial one reeds and the river are on one side and a watery marsh
on the other in that part which bounded his lands and which extended
from the mouth of hollander's creek to that of schuylkill no scene can
be imagined less enticing to a lover of the picturesque than this the
shore is deformed with mud and incumbered with a forest of reeds the
fields in most seasons are mire but when they afford a firm footing
the ditches by which they are bounded and intersected are mantled with
stagnating green and emit the most noxious exhalations health is no
less a stranger to those seats than pleasure spring and autumn are sure
to be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents

the scenes which environed our dwellings at mettingen constituted the
reverse of this schuylkill was here a pure and translucid current
broken into wild and ceaseless music by rocky points murmuring on a
sandy margin and reflecting on its surface banks of all varieties of
height and degrees of declivity these banks were chequered by patches
of dark verdure and shapeless masses of white marble and crowned by
copses of cedar or by the regular magnificence of orchards which at
this season were in blossom and were prodigal of odours the ground
which receded from the river was scooped into valleys and dales its
beauties were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother who
bedecked this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings with every
species of vegetable ornament from the giant arms of the oak to the
clustering tendrils of the honey-suckle

to screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own residence it had
been proposed to pleyel to spend the months of spring with us he had
apparently acquiesced in this proposal but the late event induced him
to change his purpose he was only to be seen by visiting him in his
retirements his gaiety had flown and every passion was absorbed in
eagerness to procure tidings from saxony i have mentioned the arrival
of another vessel from the elbe he descried her early one morning as
he was passing along the skirt of the river she was easily recognized
being the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to germany
he immediately went on board but found no letters directed to him
this omission was in some degree compensated by meeting with an old
acquaintance among the passengers who had till lately been a resident
in leipsig this person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate
of theresa by relating the particulars of her death and funeral

thus was the truth of the former intimation attested no longer devoured
by suspense the grief of pleyel was not long in yielding to the
influence of society he gave himself up once more to our company his
vivacity had indeed been damped but even in this respect he was a more
acceptable companion than formerly since his seriousness was neither
incommunicative nor sullen

these incidents for a time occupied all our thoughts in me they
produced a sentiment not unallied to pleasure and more speedily than in
the case of my friends were intermixed with other topics my brother was
particularly affected by them it was easy to perceive that most of his
meditations were tinctured from this source to this was to be ascribed
a design in which his pen was at this period engaged of collecting
and investigating the facts which relate to that mysterious personage
the daemon of socrates

my brother's skill in greek and roman learning was exceeded by that of
few and no doubt the world would have accepted a treatise upon this
subject from his hand with avidity but alas this and every other
scheme of felicity and honor were doomed to sudden blast and hopeless
extermination



chapter vi


i now come to the mention of a person with whose name the most turbulent
sensations are connected it is with a shuddering reluctance that i
enter on the province of describing him now it is that i begin to
perceive the difficulty of the task which i have undertaken but it
would be weakness to shrink from it my blood is congealed and my
fingers are palsied when i call up his image shame upon my cowardly and
infirm heart hitherto i have proceeded with some degree of composure
but now i must pause i mean not that dire remembrance shall subdue my
courage or baffle my design but this weakness cannot be immediately
conquered i must desist for a little while

i have taken a few turns in my chamber and have gathered strength
enough to proceed yet have i not projected a task beyond my power to
execute if thus on the very threshold of the scene my knees faulter
and i sink how shall i support myself when i rush into the midst of
horrors such as no heart has hitherto conceived nor tongue related i
sicken and recoil at the prospect and yet my irresolution is momentary
i have not formed this design upon slight grounds and though i may at
times pause and hesitate i will not be finally diverted from it

and thou o most fatal and potent of mankind in what terms shall i
describe thee what words are adequate to the just delineation of thy
character how shall i detail the means which rendered the secrecy of
thy purposes unfathomable but i will not anticipate let me recover
if possible a sober strain let me keep down the flood of passion that
would render me precipitate or powerless let me stifle the agonies that
are awakened by thy name let me for a time regard thee as a being
of no terrible attributes let me tear myself from contemplation of
the evils of which it is but too certain that thou wast the author and
limit my view to those harmless appearances which attended thy entrance
on the stage

one sunny afternoon i was standing in the door of my house when i
marked a person passing close to the edge of the bank that was in
front his pace was a careless and lingering one and had none of that
gracefulness and ease which distinguish a person with certain advantages
of education from a clown his gait was rustic and aukward his form was
ungainly and disproportioned shoulders broad and square breast sunken
his head drooping his body of uniform breadth supported by long and
lank legs were the ingredients of his frame his garb was not ill
adapted to such a figure a slouched hat tarnished by the weather a
coat of thick grey cloth cut and wrought as it seemed by a country
tailor blue worsted stockings and shoes fastened by thongs and deeply
discoloured by dust which brush had never disturbed constituted his
dress

there was nothing remarkable in these appearances they were frequently
to be met with on the road and in the harvest field i cannot tell why
i gazed upon them on this occasion with more than ordinary attention
unless it were that such figures were seldom seen by me except on the
road or field this lawn was only traversed by men whose views were
directed to the pleasures of the walk or the grandeur of the scenery

he passed slowly along frequently pausing as if to examine the
prospect more deliberately but never turning his eye towards the house
so as to allow me a view of his countenance presently he entered a
copse at a small distance and disappeared my eye followed him while
he remained in sight if his image remained for any duration in my fancy
after his departure it was because no other object occurred sufficient
to expel it

i continued in the same spot for half an hour vaguely and by fits
contemplating the image of this wanderer and drawing from outward
appearances those inferences with respect to the intellectual history
of this person which experience affords us i reflected on the
alliance which commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice
of agriculture and indulged myself in airy speculations as to the
influence of progressive knowledge in dissolving this alliance and
embodying the dreams of the poets i asked why the plough and the hoe
might not become the trade of every human being and how this
trade might be made conducive to or at least consistent with the
acquisition of wisdom and eloquence

weary with these reflections i returned to the kitchen to perform some
household office i had usually but one servant and she was a girl
about my own age i was busy near the chimney and she was employed near
the door of the apartment when some one knocked the door was opened by
her and she was immediately addressed with pry'thee good girl canst
thou supply a thirsty man with a glass of buttermilk she answered
that there was none in the house aye but there is some in the dairy
yonder thou knowest as well as i though hermes never taught thee that
though every dairy be an house every house is not a dairy to
this speech though she understood only a part of it she replied
by repeating her assurances that she had none to give well then
rejoined the stranger for charity's sweet sake hand me forth a cup
of cold water the girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it
nay give me the cup and suffer me to help myself neither manacled
nor lame i should merit burial in the maw of carrion crows if i laid
this task upon thee she gave him the cup and he turned to go to the
spring

i listened to this dialogue in silence the words uttered by the person
without affected me as somewhat singular but what chiefly rendered
them remarkable was the tone that accompanied them it was wholly new
my brother's voice and pleyel's were musical and energetic i had fondly
imagined that in this respect they were surpassed by none now my
mistake was detected i cannot pretend to communicate the impression
that was made upon me by these accents or to depict the degree in which
force and sweetness were blended in them they were articulated with a
distinctness that was unexampled in my experience but this was not all
the voice was not only mellifluent and clear but the emphasis was so
just and the modulation so impassioned that it seemed as if an heart
of stone could not fail of being moved by it it imparted to me an
emotion altogether involuntary and incontroulable when he uttered the
words for charity's sweet sake i dropped the cloth that i held in
my hand my heart overflowed with sympathy and my eyes with unbidden
tears

this description will appear to you trifling or incredible the
importance of these circumstances will be manifested in the sequel
the manner in which i was affected on this occasion was to my own
apprehension a subject of astonishment the tones were indeed such as
i never heard before but that they should in an instant as it were
dissolve me in tears will not easily be believed by others and can
scarcely be comprehended by myself

it will be readily supposed that i was somewhat inquisitive as to the
person and demeanour of our visitant after a moment's pause i stepped
to the door and looked after him judge my surprize when i beheld the
self-same figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank my
fancy had conjured up a very different image a form and attitude and
garb were instantly created worthy to accompany such elocution but
this person was in all visible respects the reverse of this phantom
strange as it may seem i could not speedily reconcile myself to this
disappointment instead of returning to my employment i threw myself
in a chair that was placed opposite the door and sunk into a fit of
musing

my attention was in a few minutes recalled by the stranger who
returned with the empty cup in his hand i had not thought of the
circumstance or should certainly have chosen a different seat he no
sooner shewed himself than a confused sense of impropriety added to
the suddenness of the interview for which not having foreseen it
i had made no preparation threw me into a state of the most painful
embarrassment he brought with him a placid brow but no sooner had he
cast his eyes upon me than his face was as glowingly suffused as
my own he placed the cup upon the bench stammered out thanks and
retired

it was some time before i could recover my wonted composure i had
snatched a view of the stranger's countenance the impression that it
made was vivid and indelible his cheeks were pallid and lank his eyes
sunken his forehead overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs his teeth
large and irregular though sound and brilliantly white and his chin
discoloured by a tetter his skin was of coarse grain and sallow hue
every feature was wide of beauty and the outline of his face reminded
you of an inverted cone

and yet his forehead so far as shaggy locks would allow it to be seen
his eyes lustrously black and possessing in the midst of haggardness
a radiance inexpressibly serene and potent and something in the rest of
his features which it would be in vain to describe but which served to
betoken a mind of the highest order were essential ingredients in the
portrait this in the effects which immediately flowed from it i count
among the most extraordinary incidents of my life this face seen for
a moment continued for hours to occupy my fancy to the exclusion of
almost every other image i had purposed to spend the evening with my
brother but i could not resist the inclination of forming a sketch
upon paper of this memorable visage whether my hand was aided by any
peculiar inspiration or i was deceived by my own fond conceptions this
portrait though hastily executed appeared unexceptionable to my own
taste

i placed it at all distances and in all lights my eyes were rivetted
upon it half the night passed away in wakefulness and in contemplation
of this picture so flexible and yet so stubborn is the human mind
so obedient to impulses the most transient and brief and yet so
unalterably observant of the direction which is given to it how little
did i then foresee the termination of that chain of which this may be
regarded as the first link

next day arose in darkness and storm torrents of rain fell during
the whole day attended with incessant thunder which reverberated in
stunning echoes from the opposite declivity the inclemency of the air
would not allow me to walk-out i had indeed no inclination to leave
my apartment i betook myself to the contemplation of this portrait
whose attractions time had rather enhanced than diminished i laid aside
my usual occupations and seating myself at a window consumed the day
in alternately looking out upon the storm and gazing at the picture
which lay upon a table before me you will perhaps deem this conduct
somewhat singular and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of temper i
am not aware of any such peculiarities i can account for my devotion to
this image no otherwise than by supposing that its properties were
rare and prodigious perhaps you will suspect that such were the
first inroads of a passion incident to every female heart and
which frequently gains a footing by means even more slight and more
improbable than these i shall not controvert the reasonableness of the
suspicion but leave you at liberty to draw from my narrative what
conclusions you please

night at length returned and the storm ceased the air was once more
clear and calm and bore an affecting contrast to that uproar of the
elements by which it had been preceded i spent the darksome hours as
i spent the day contemplative and seated at the window why was my mind
absorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary why did my bosom heave with
sighs and my eyes overflow with tears was the tempest that had just
past a signal of the ruin which impended over me my soul fondly dwelt
upon the images of my brother and his children yet they only increased
the mournfulness of my contemplations the smiles of the charming babes
were as bland as formerly the same dignity sat on the brow of their
father and yet i thought of them with anguish something whispered
that the happiness we at present enjoyed was set on mutable foundations
death must happen to all whether our felicity was to be subverted by it
to-morrow or whether it was ordained that we should lay down our heads
full of years and of honor was a question that no human being could
solve at other times these ideas seldom intruded i either forbore to
reflect upon the destiny that is reserved for all men or the reflection
was mixed up with images that disrobed it of terror but now the
uncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its usual and
alleviating accompaniments i said to myself we must die sooner or
later we must disappear for ever from the face of the earth whatever
be the links that hold us to life they must be broken this scene
of existence is in all its parts calamitous the greater number is
oppressed with immediate evils and those the tide of whose fortunes is
full how small is their portion of enjoyment since they know that it
will terminate

for some time i indulged myself without reluctance in these gloomy
thoughts but at length the dejection which they produced became
insupportably painful i endeavoured to dissipate it with music i had
all my grand-father's melody as well as poetry by rote i now lighted
by chance on a ballad which commemorated the fate of a german cavalier
who fell at the siege of nice under godfrey of bouillon my choice was
unfortunate for the scenes of violence and carnage which were here
wildly but forcibly pourtrayed only suggested to my thoughts a new
topic in the horrors of war

i sought refuge but ineffectually in sleep my mind was thronged by
vivid but confused images and no effort that i made was sufficient to
drive them away in this situation i heard the clock which hung in
the room give the signal for twelve it was the same instrument which
formerly hung in my father's chamber and which on account of its
being his workmanship was regarded by every one of our family with
veneration it had fallen to me in the division of his property and
was placed in this asylum the sound awakened a series of reflections
respecting his death i was not allowed to pursue them for scarcely
had the vibrations ceased when my attention was attracted by a whisper
which at first appeared to proceed from lips that were laid close to
my ear

no wonder that a circumstance like this startled me in the first
impulse of my terror i uttered a slight scream and shrunk to the
opposite side of the bed in a moment however i recovered from my
trepidation i was habitually indifferent to all the causes of fear
by which the majority are afflicted i entertained no apprehension
of either ghosts or robbers our security had never been molested by
either and i made use of no means to prevent or counterwork their
machinations my tranquillity on this occasion was quickly retrieved
the whisper evidently proceeded from one who was posted at my bed-side
the first idea that suggested itself was that it was uttered by the
girl who lived with me as a servant perhaps somewhat had alarmed her
or she was sick and had come to request my assistance by whispering in
my ear she intended to rouse without alarming me

full of this persuasion i called judith said i is it you what
do you want is there any thing the matter with you no answer was
returned i repeated my inquiry but equally in vain cloudy as was the
atmosphere and curtained as my bed was nothing was visible i withdrew
the curtain and leaning my head on my elbow i listened with the
deepest attention to catch some new sound meanwhile i ran over in my
thoughts every circumstance that could assist my conjectures

my habitation was a wooden edifice consisting of two stories in each
story were two rooms separated by an entry or middle passage with
which they communicated by opposite doors the passage on the lower
story had doors at the two ends and a stair-case windows answered to
the doors on the upper story annexed to this on the eastern side were
wings divided in like manner into an upper and lower room one of
them comprized a kitchen and chamber above it for the servant and
communicated on both stories with the parlour adjoining it below
and the chamber adjoining it above the opposite wing is of smaller
dimensions the rooms not being above eight feet square the lower of
these was used as a depository of household implements the upper was a
closet in which i deposited my books and papers they had but one inlet
which was from the room adjoining there was no window in the lower one
and in the upper a small aperture which communicated light and air but
would scarcely admit the body the door which led into this was close
to my bed-head and was always locked but when i myself was within the
avenues below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights

the maid was my only companion and she could not reach my chamber
without previously passing through the opposite chamber and the middle
passage of which however the doors were usually unfastened if she
had occasioned this noise she would have answered my repeated calls
no other conclusion therefore was left me but that i had mistaken the
sounds and that my imagination had transformed some casual noise into
the voice of a human creature satisfied with this solution i was
preparing to relinquish my listening attitude when my ear was again
saluted with a new and yet louder whispering it appeared as before
to issue from lips that touched my pillow a second effort of attention
however clearly shewed me that the sounds issued from within the
closet the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow

this second interruption occasioned a shock less vehement than the
former i started but gave no audible token of alarm i was so much
mistress of my feelings as to continue listening to what should be
said the whisper was distinct hoarse and uttered so as to shew that
the speaker was desirous of being heard by some one near but at the
same time studious to avoid being overheard by any other

stop stop i say madman as you are there are better means than that
curse upon your rashness there is no need to shoot

such were the words uttered in a tone of eagerness and anger within so
small a distance of my pillow what construction could i put upon
them my heart began to palpitate with dread of some unknown danger
presently another voice but equally near me was heard whispering in
answer why not i will draw a trigger in this business but perdition
be my lot if i do more to this the first voice returned in a tone
which rage had heightened in a small degree above a whisper coward
stand aside and see me do it i will grasp her throat i will do her
business in an instant she shall not have time so much as to groan
what wonder that i was petrified by sounds so dreadful murderers
lurked in my closet they were planning the means of my destruction one
resolved to shoot and the other menaced suffocation their means being
chosen they would forthwith break the door flight instantly suggested
itself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous i deliberated not
a moment but fear adding wings to my speed i leaped out of bed and
scantily robed as i was rushed out of the chamber down stairs and
into the open air i can hardly recollect the process of turning
keys and withdrawing bolts my terrors urged me forward with almost a
mechanical impulse i stopped not till i reached my brother's door
i had not gained the threshold when exhausted by the violence of my
emotions and by my speed i sunk down in a fit

how long i remained in this situation i know not when i recovered i
found myself stretched on a bed surrounded by my sister and her
female servants i was astonished at the scene before me but gradually
recovered the recollection of what had happened i answered their
importunate inquiries as well as i was able my brother and pleyel
whom the storm of the preceding day chanced to detain here informing
themselves of every particular proceeded with lights and weapons to my
deserted habitation they entered my chamber and my closet and found
every thing in its proper place and customary order the door of the
closet was locked and appeared not to have been opened in my absence
they went to judith's apartment they found her asleep and in safety
pleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl and finding
her wholly ignorant of what had passed they directed her to return to
her chamber they then fastened the doors and returned

my friends were disposed to regard this transaction as a dream that
persons should be actually immured in this closet to which in the
circumstances of the time access from without or within was apparently
impossible they could not seriously believe that any human beings
had intended murder unless it were to cover a scheme of pillage was
incredible but that no such design had been formed was evident
from the security in which the furniture of the house and the closet
remained

i revolved every incident and expression that had occurred my
senses assured me of the truth of them and yet their abruptness and
improbability made me in my turn somewhat incredulous the adventure
had made a deep impression on my fancy and it was not till after a
week's abode at my brother's that i resolved to resume the possession
of my own dwelling there was another circumstance that enhanced the
mysteriousness of this event after my recovery it was obvious to
inquire by what means the attention of the family had been drawn to my
situation i had fallen before i had reached the threshold or was able
to give any signal my brother related that while this was transacting
in my chamber he himself was awake in consequence of some slight
indisposition and lay according to his custom musing on some favorite
topic suddenly the silence which was remarkably profound was broken
by a voice of most piercing shrillness that seemed to be uttered by one
in the hall below his chamber awake arise it exclaimed hasten to
succour one that is dying at your door

this summons was effectual there was no one in the house who was not
roused by it pleyel was the first to obey and my brother overtook him
before he reached the hall what was the general astonishment when your
friend was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door pale
ghastly and with every mark of death

this was the third instance of a voice exerted for the benefit of this
little community the agent was no less inscrutable in this than in the
former case when i ruminated upon these events my soul was suspended
in wonder and awe was i really deceived in imagining that i heard the
closet conversation i was no longer at liberty to question the reality
of those accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill
which had imparted tidings of the death of the german lady to pleyel
and which had lately summoned them to my assistance

but how was i to regard this midnight conversation hoarse and manlike
voices conferring on the means of death so near my bed and at such
an hour how had my ancient security vanished that dwelling which had
hitherto been an inviolate asylum was now beset with danger to my
life that solitude formerly so dear to me could no longer be endured
pleyel who had consented to reside with us during the months of spring
lodged in the vacant chamber in order to quiet my alarms he treated
my fears with ridicule and in a short time very slight traces of them
remained but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights
were passed at my house or at my brother's this arrangement gave
general satisfaction



chapter vii


i will not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which these
incidents occasioned after all our efforts we came no nearer to
dispelling the mist in which they were involved and time instead of
facilitating a solution only accumulated our doubts in the midst of
thoughts excited by these events i was not unmindful of my interview
with the stranger i related the particulars and shewed the portrait to
my friends pleyel recollected to have met with a figure resembling
my description in the city but neither his face or garb made the same
impression upon him that it made upon me it was a hint to rally me upon
my prepossessions and to amuse us with a thousand ludicrous anecdotes
which he had collected in his travels he made no scruple to charge me
with being in love and threatened to inform the swain when he met him
of his good fortune

pleyel's temper made him susceptible of no durable impressions his
conversation was occasionally visited by gleams of his ancient vivacity
but though his impetuosity was sometimes inconvenient there was
nothing to dread from his malice i had no fear that my character or
dignity would suffer in his hands and was not heartily displeased when
he declared his intention of profiting by his first meeting with the
stranger to introduce him to our acquaintance

some weeks after this i had spent a toilsome day and as the sun
declined found myself disposed to seek relief in a walk the river
bank is at this part of it and for some considerable space upward
so rugged and steep as not to be easily descended in a recess of this
declivity near the southern verge of my little demesne was placed a
slight building with seats and lattices from a crevice of the rock
to which this edifice was attached there burst forth a stream of the
purest water which leaping from ledge to ledge for the space of sixty
feet produced a freshness in the air and a murmur the most delicious
and soothing imaginable these added to the odours of the cedars
which embowered it and of the honey-suckle which clustered among the
lattices rendered this my favorite retreat in summer

on this occasion i repaired hither my spirits drooped through the
fatigue of long attention and i threw myself upon a bench in a state
both mentally and personally of the utmost supineness the lulling
sounds of the waterfall the fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm
my spirits and in a short time to sink me into sleep either the
uneasiness of my posture or some slight indisposition molested my
repose with dreams of no cheerful hue after various incoherences
had taken their turn to occupy my fancy i at length imagined myself
walking in the evening twilight to my brother's habitation a pit
methought had been dug in the path i had taken of which i was not
aware as i carelessly pursued my walk i thought i saw my brother
standing at some distance before me beckoning and calling me to make
haste he stood on the opposite edge of the gulph i mended my pace and
one step more would have plunged me into this abyss had not some
one from behind caught suddenly my arm and exclaimed in a voice of
eagerness and terror hold hold

the sound broke my sleep and i found myself at the next moment
standing on my feet and surrounded by the deepest darkness images
so terrific and forcible disabled me for a time from distinguishing
between sleep and wakefulness and withheld from me the knowledge of my
actual condition my first panics were succeeded by the perturbations of
surprize to find myself alone in the open air and immersed in so deep
a gloom i slowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon and how
i came hither i could not estimate the time but saw the propriety of
returning with speed to the house my faculties were still too confused
and the darkness too intense to allow me immediately to find my way up
the steep i sat down therefore to recover myself and to reflect upon
my situation

this was no sooner done than a low voice was heard from behind the
lattice on the side where i sat between the rock and the lattice was a
chasm not wide enough to admit a human body yet in this chasm he that
spoke appeared to be stationed attend attend but be not terrified

i started and exclaimed good heavens what is that who are you

a friend one come not to injure but to save you fear nothing

this voice was immediately recognized to be the same with one of
those which i had heard in the closet it was the voice of him who had
proposed to shoot rather than to strangle his victim my terror made
me at once mute and motionless he continued i leagued to murder
you i repent mark my bidding and be safe avoid this spot the snares
of death encompass it elsewhere danger will be distant but this spot
shun it as you value your life mark me further profit by this warning
but divulge it not if a syllable of what has passed escape you your
doom is sealed remember your father and be faithful

here the accents ceased and left me overwhelmed with dismay i was
fraught with the persuasion that during every moment i remained here
my life was endangered but i could not take a step without hazard of
falling to the bottom of the precipice the path leading to the summit
was short but rugged and intricate even star-light was excluded by the
umbrage and not the faintest gleam was afforded to guide my steps what
should i do to depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous

in this state of uncertainty i perceived a ray flit across the gloom
and disappear another succeeded which was stronger and remained for
a passing moment it glittered on the shrubs that were scattered at the
entrance and gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few seconds till
they finally gave place to unintermitted darkness

the first visitings of this light called up a train of horrors in my
mind destruction impended over this spot the voice which i had lately
heard had warned me to retire and had menaced me with the fate of my
father if i refused i was desirous but unable to obey these gleams
were such as preluded the stroke by which he fell the hour perhaps
was the same i shuddered as if i had beheld suspended over me the
exterminating sword

presently a new and stronger illumination burst through the lattice
on the right hand and a voice from the edge of the precipice above
called out my name it was pleyel joyfully did i recognize his accents
but such was the tumult of my thoughts that i had not power to answer
him till he had frequently repeated his summons i hurried at length
from the fatal spot and directed by the lanthorn which he bore
ascended the hill

pale and breathless it was with difficulty i could support myself he
anxiously inquired into the cause of my affright and the motive of my
unusual absence he had returned from my brother's at a late hour and
was informed by judith that i had walked out before sun-set and had
not yet returned this intelligence was somewhat alarming he waited
some time but my absence continuing he had set out in search of me
he had explored the neighbourhood with the utmost care but receiving
no tidings of me he was preparing to acquaint my brother with this
circumstance when he recollected the summer-house on the bank and
conceived it possible that some accident had detained me there he again
inquired into the cause of this detention and of that confusion and
dismay which my looks testified

i told him that i had strolled hither in the afternoon that sleep had
overtaken me as i sat and that i had awakened a few minutes before
his arrival i could tell him no more in the present impetuosity of my
thoughts i was almost dubious whether the pit into which my brother
had endeavoured to entice me and the voice that talked through the
lattice were not parts of the same dream i remembered likewise the
charge of secrecy and the penalty denounced if i should rashly divulge
what i had heard for these reasons i was silent on that subject and
shutting myself in my chamber delivered myself up to contemplation

what i have related will no doubt appear to you a fable you will
believe that calamity has subverted my reason and that i am amusing
you with the chimeras of my brain instead of facts that have really
happened i shall not be surprized or offended if these be your
suspicions i know not indeed how you can deny them admission for if
to me the immediate witness they were fertile of perplexity and doubt
how must they affect another to whom they are recommended only by
my testimony it was only by subsequent events that i was fully and
incontestibly assured of the veracity of my senses

meanwhile what was i to think i had been assured that a design had been
formed against my life the ruffians had leagued to murder me whom had
i offended who was there with whom i had ever maintained intercourse
who was capable of harbouring such atrocious purposes

my temper was the reverse of cruel and imperious my heart was touched
with sympathy for the children of misfortune but this sympathy was not
a barren sentiment my purse scanty as it was was ever open and my
hands ever active to relieve distress many were the wretches whom
my personal exertions had extricated from want and disease and who
rewarded me with their gratitude there was no face which lowered at my
approach and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing on the
contrary there was none over whose fate i had exerted any influence
or to whom i was known by reputation who did not greet me with smiles
and dismiss me with proofs of veneration yet did not my senses assure
me that a plot was laid against my life

i am not destitute of courage i have shewn myself deliberative and calm
in the midst of peril i have hazarded my own life for the preservation
of another but now was i confused and panic struck i have not lived
so as to fear death yet to perish by an unseen and secret stroke to be
mangled by the knife of an assassin was a thought at which i shuddered
what had i done to deserve to be made the victim of malignant passions

but soft was i not assured that my life was safe in all places but
one and why was the treason limited to take effect in this spot i
was every where equally defenceless my house and chamber were at all
times accessible danger still impended over me the bloody purpose was
still entertained but the hand that was to execute it was powerless in
all places but one

here i had remained for the last four or five hours without the means
of resistance or defence yet i had not been attacked a human being was
at hand who was conscious of my presence and warned me hereafter to
avoid this retreat his voice was not absolutely new but had i never
heard it but once before but why did he prohibit me from relating
this incident to others and what species of death will be awarded if i
disobey

he talked of my father he intimated that disclosure would pull upon my
head the same destruction was then the death of my father portentous
and inexplicable as it was the consequence of human machinations it
should seem that this being is apprised of the true nature of this
event and is conscious of the means that led to it whether it shall
likewise fall upon me depends upon the observance of silence was it
the infraction of a similar command that brought so horrible a penalty
upon my father

such were the reflections that haunted me during the night and which
effectually deprived me of sleep next morning at breakfast pleyel
related an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning
the night before early the preceding morning his occasions called him
to the city he had stepped into a coffee-house to while away an hour
here he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be
the same whose hasty visit i have mentioned and whose extraordinary
visage and tones had so powerfully affected me on an attentive survey
however he proved likewise to be one with whom my friend had had some
intercourse in europe this authorised the liberty of accosting him and
after some conversation mindful as pleyel said of the footing which
this stranger had gained in my heart he had ventured to invite him
to mettingen the invitation had been cheerfully accepted and a visit
promised on the afternoon of the next day

this information excited no sober emotions in my breast i was of
course eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient
intercourse when and where had they met what knew he of the life and
character of this man

in answer to my inquiries he informed me that three years before
he was a traveller in spain he had made an excursion from valencia to
murviedro with a view to inspect the remains of roman magnificence
scattered in the environs of that town while traversing the scite
of the theatre of old saguntum he lighted upon this man seated on a
stone and deeply engaged in perusing the work of the deacon marti a
short conversation ensued which proved the stranger to be english they
returned to valencia together

his garb aspect and deportment were wholly spanish a residence of
three years in the country indefatigable attention to the language
and a studious conformity with the customs of the people had made him
indistinguishable from a native when he chose to assume that character
pleyel found him to be connected on the footing of friendship and
respect with many eminent merchants in that city he had embraced the
catholic religion and adopted a spanish name instead of his own which
was carwin and devoted himself to the literature and religion of his
new country he pursued no profession but subsisted on remittances from
england

while pleyel remained in valencia carwin betrayed no aversion to
intercourse and the former found no small attractions in the society of
this new acquaintance on general topics he was highly intelligent and
communicative he had visited every corner of spain and could furnish
the most accurate details respecting its ancient and present state
on topics of religion and of his own history previous to his
transformation into a spaniard he was invariably silent you could
merely gather from his discourse that he was english and that he was
well acquainted with the neighbouring countries

his character excited considerable curiosity in this observer it was
not easy to reconcile his conversion to the romish faith with those
proofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different
occasions a suspicion was sometimes admitted that his belief was
counterfeited for some political purpose the most careful observation
however produced no discovery his manners were at all times harmless
and inartificial and his habits those of a lover of contemplation and
seclusion he appeared to have contracted an affection for pleyel who
was not slow to return it

my friend after a month's residence in this city returned into france
and since that period had heard nothing concerning carwin till his
appearance at mettingen

on this occasion carwin had received pleyel's greeting with a certain
distance and solemnity to which the latter had not been accustomed he
had waved noticing the inquiries of pleyel respecting his desertion
of spain in which he had formerly declared that it was his purpose to
spend his life he had assiduously diverted the attention of the latter
to indifferent topics but was still on every theme as eloquent and
judicious as formerly why he had assumed the garb of a rustic pleyel
was unable to conjecture perhaps it might be poverty perhaps he was
swayed by motives which it was his interest to conceal but which were
connected with consequences of the utmost moment

such was the sum of my friend's information i was not sorry to be left
alone during the greater part of this day every employment was irksome
which did not leave me at liberty to meditate i had now a new subject
on which to exercise my thoughts before evening i should be ushered
into his presence and listen to those tones whose magical and thrilling
power i had already experienced but with what new images would he then
be accompanied

carwin was an adherent to the romish faith yet was an englishman by
birth and perhaps a protestant by education he had adopted spain for
his country and had intimated a design to spend his days there yet now
was an inhabitant of this district and disguised by the habiliments of
a clown what could have obliterated the impressions of his youth and
made him abjure his religion and his country what subsequent events had
introduced so total a change in his plans in withdrawing from spain
had he reverted to the religion of his ancestors or was it true that
his former conversion was deceitful and that his conduct had been
swayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal

hours were consumed in revolving these ideas my meditations were
intense and when the series was broken i began to reflect with
astonishment on my situation from the death of my parents till the
commencement of this year my life had been serene and blissful beyond
the ordinary portion of humanity but now my bosom was corroded by
anxiety i was visited by dread of unknown dangers and the future was
a scene over which clouds rolled and thunders muttered i compared the
cause with the effect and they seemed disproportioned to each other
all unaware and in a manner which i had no power to explain i was
pushed from my immoveable and lofty station and cast upon a sea of
troubles

i determined to be my brother's visitant on this evening yet my
resolves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance pleyel's
insinuations that i was in love affected in no degree my belief yet
the consciousness that this was the opinion of one who would probably
be present at our introduction to each other would excite all that
confusion which the passion itself is apt to produce this would confirm
him in his error and call forth new railleries his mirth when exerted
upon this topic was the source of the bitterest vexation had he been
aware of its influence upon my happiness his temper would not have
allowed him to persist but this influence it was my chief endeavour
to conceal that the belief of my having bestowed my heart upon another
produced in my friend none but ludicrous sensations was the true cause
of my distress but if this had been discovered by him my distress
would have been unspeakably aggravated



chapter viii


as soon as evening arrived i performed my visit carwin made one of the
company into which i was ushered appearances were the same as when i
before beheld him his garb was equally negligent and rustic i gazed
upon his countenance with new curiosity my situation was such as to
enable me to bestow upon it a deliberate examination viewed at more
leisure it lost none of its wonderful properties i could not deny my
homage to the intelligence expressed in it but was wholly uncertain
whether he were an object to be dreaded or adored and whether his
powers had been exerted to evil or to good

he was sparing in discourse but whatever he said was pregnant with
meaning and uttered with rectitude of articulation and force of
emphasis of which i had entertained no conception previously to my
knowledge of him notwithstanding the uncouthness of his garb his
manners were not unpolished all topics were handled by him with skill
and without pedantry or affectation he uttered no sentiment calculated
to produce a disadvantageous impression on the contrary his
observations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling
they were introduced without parade and accompanied with that degree of
earnestness which indicates sincerity

he parted from us not till late refusing an invitation to spend the
night here but readily consented to repeat his visit his visits
were frequently repeated each day introduced us to a more intimate
acquaintance with his sentiments but left us wholly in the dark
concerning that about which we were most inquisitive he studiously
avoided all mention of his past or present situation even the place of
his abode in the city he concealed from us

our sphere in this respect being somewhat limited and the
intellectual endowments of this man being indisputably great his
deportment was more diligently marked and copiously commented on by
us than you perhaps will think the circumstances warranted not a
gesture or glance or accent that was not in our private assemblies
discussed and inferences deduced from it it may well be thought that
he modelled his behaviour by an uncommon standard when with all our
opportunities and accuracy of observation we were able for a long
time to gather no satisfactory information he afforded us no ground on
which to build even a plausible conjecture

there is a degree of familiarity which takes place between constant
associates that justifies the negligence of many rules of which in
an earlier period of their intercourse politeness requires the exact
observance inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are
prompted by a disinterested concern for our welfare and this solicitude
is not only pardonable but may justly be demanded from those who chuse
us for their companions this state of things was more slow to arrive
on this occasion than on most others on account of the gravity and
loftiness of this man's behaviour

pleyel however began at length to employ regular means for this end
he occasionally alluded to the circumstances in which they had formerly
met and remarked the incongruousness between the religion and habits
of a spaniard with those of a native of britain he expressed
his astonishment at meeting our guest in this corner of the globe
especially as when they parted in spain he was taught to believe that
carwin should never leave that country he insinuated that a change
so great must have been prompted by motives of a singular and momentous
kind

no answer or an answer wide of the purpose was generally made to these
insinuations britons and spaniards he said are votaries of the same
deity and square their faith by the same precepts their ideas are
drawn from the same fountains of literature and they speak dialects of
the same tongue their government and laws have more resemblances than
differences they were formerly provinces of the same civil and till
lately of the same religious empire

as to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode
these must unavoidably be fleeting and mutable if not bound to one spot
by conjugal or parental ties or by the nature of that employment to
which we are indebted for subsistence the inducements to change are far
more numerous and powerful than opposite inducements

he spoke as if desirous of shewing that he was not aware of the tendency
of pleyel's remarks yet certain tokens were apparent that proved him
by no means wanting in penetration these tokens were to be read in his
countenance and not in his words when any thing was said indicating
curiosity in us the gloom of his countenance was deepened his eyes
sunk to the ground and his wonted air was not resumed without visible
struggle hence it was obvious to infer that some incidents of
his life were reflected on by him with regret and that since these
incidents were carefully concealed and even that regret which flowed
from them laboriously stifled they had not been merely disastrous the
secrecy that was observed appeared not designed to provoke or baffle the
inquisitive but was prompted by the shame or by the prudence of guilt

these ideas which were adopted by pleyel and my brother as well as
myself hindered us from employing more direct means for accomplishing
our wishes questions might have been put in such terms that no room
should be left for the pretence of misapprehension and if modesty
merely had been the obstacle such questions would not have been
wanting but we considered that if the disclosure were productive of
pain or disgrace it was inhuman to extort it

amidst the various topics that were discussed in his presence allusions
were of course made to the inexplicable events that had lately
happened at those times the words and looks of this man were objects
of my particular attention the subject was extraordinary and any
one whose experience or reflections could throw any light upon it was
entitled to my gratitude as this man was enlightened by reading and
travel i listened with eagerness to the remarks which he should make

at first i entertained a kind of apprehension that the tale would be
heard by him with incredulity and secret ridicule i had formerly heard
stories that resembled this in some of their mysterious circumstances
but they were commonly heard by me with contempt i was doubtful
whether the same impression would not now be made on the mind of our
guest but i was mistaken in my fears

he heard them with seriousness and without any marks either of
surprize or incredulity he pursued with visible pleasure that kind
of disquisition which was naturally suggested by them his fancy was
eminently vigorous and prolific and if he did not persuade us that
human beings are sometimes admitted to a sensible intercourse with the
author of nature he at least won over our inclination to the cause
he merely deduced from his own reasonings that such intercourse
was probable but confessed that though he was acquainted with many
instances somewhat similar to those which had been related by us none
of them were perfectly exempted from the suspicion of human agency

on being requested to relate these instances he amused us with many
curious details his narratives were constructed with so much skill
and rehearsed with so much energy that all the effects of a dramatic
exhibition were frequently produced by them those that were most
coherent and most minute and of consequence least entitled to credit
were yet rendered probable by the exquisite art of this rhetorician for
every difficulty that was suggested a ready and plausible solution
was furnished mysterious voices had always a share in producing
the catastrophe but they were always to be explained on some known
principles either as reflected into a focus or communicated through
a tube i could not but remark that his narratives however complex or
marvellous contained no instance sufficiently parallel to those that
had befallen ourselves and in which the solution was applicable to our
own case

my brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our guest even
in some of the facts which were related by carwin he maintained the
probability of celestial interference when the latter was disposed to
deny it and had found as he imagined footsteps of an human agent
pleyel was by no means equally credulous he scrupled not to deny faith
to any testimony but that of his senses and allowed the facts which had
lately been supported by this testimony not to mould his belief but
merely to give birth to doubts

it was soon observed that carwin adopted in some degree a similar
distinction a tale of this kind related by others he would believe
provided it was explicable upon known principles but that such notices
were actually communicated by beings of an higher order he would
believe only when his own ears were assailed in a manner which could not
be otherwise accounted for civility forbad him to contradict my brother
or myself but his understanding refused to acquiesce in our testimony
besides he was disposed to question whether the voices heard in the
temple at the foot of the hill and in my closet were not really
uttered by human organs on this supposition he was desired to explain
how the effect was produced

he answered that the power of mimickry was very common catharine's
voice might easily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill who would
find no difficulty in eluding by flight the search of wieland the
tidings of the death of the saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand
who overheard the conversation who conjectured her death and whose
conjecture happened to accord with the truth that the voice appeared to
come from the cieling was to be considered as an illusion of the fancy
the cry for help heard in the hall on the night of my adventure was to
be ascribed to an human creature who actually stood in the hall when he
uttered it it was of no moment he said that we could not explain by
what motives he that made the signal was led hither how imperfectly
acquainted were we with the condition and designs of the beings that
surrounded us the city was near at hand and thousands might there
exist whose powers and purposes might easily explain whatever was
mysterious in this transaction as to the closet dialogue he was
obliged to adopt one of two suppositions and affirm either that it was
fashioned in my own fancy or that it actually took place between two
persons in the closet

such was carwin's mode of explaining these appearances it is such
perhaps as would commend itself as most plausible to the most sagacious
minds but it was insufficient to impart conviction to us as to the
treason that was meditated against me it was doubtless just to conclude
that it was either real or imaginary but that it was real was attested
by the mysterious warning in the summer-house the secret of which i had
hitherto locked up in my own breast

a month passed away in this kind of intercourse as to carwin our
ignorance was in no degree enlightened respecting his genuine character
and views appearances were uniform no man possessed a larger store of
knowledge or a greater degree of skill in the communication of it to
others hence he was regarded as an inestimable addition to our society
considering the distance of my brother's house from the city he was
frequently prevailed upon to pass the night where he spent the evening
two days seldom elapsed without a visit from him hence he was regarded
as a kind of inmate of the house he entered and departed without
ceremony when he arrived he received an unaffected welcome and when he
chose to retire no importunities were used to induce him to remain

the temple was the principal scene of our social enjoyments yet the
felicity that we tasted when assembled in this asylum was but the
gleam of a former sun-shine carwin never parted with his gravity
the inscrutableness of his character and the uncertainty whether his
fellowship tended to good or to evil were seldom absent from our minds
this circumstance powerfully contributed to sadden us

my heart was the seat of growing disquietudes this change in one who
had formerly been characterized by all the exuberances of soul could
not fail to be remarked by my friends my brother was always a pattern
of solemnity my sister was clay moulded by the circumstances in which
she happened to be placed there was but one whose deportment remains
to be described as being of importance to our happiness had pleyel
likewise dismissed his vivacity

he was as whimsical and jestful as ever but he was not happy the
truth in this respect was of too much importance to me not to make me
a vigilant observer his mirth was easily perceived to be the fruit
of exertion when his thoughts wandered from the company an air of
dissatisfaction and impatience stole across his features even the
punctuality and frequency of his visits were somewhat lessened it may
be supposed that my own uneasiness was heightened by these tokens but
strange as it may seem i found in the present state of my mind no
relief but in the persuasion that pleyel was unhappy

that unhappiness indeed depended for its value in my eyes on the
cause that produced it it did not arise from the death of the saxon
lady it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of wieland
or carwin there was but one other source whence it could flow a
nameless ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred
that the ambiguousness of my behaviour was the cause



chapter ix


my brother had received a new book from germany it was a tragedy and
the first attempt of a saxon poet of whom my brother had been taught to
entertain the highest expectations the exploits of zisca the bohemian
hero were woven into a dramatic series and connection according to
german custom it was minute and diffuse and dictated by an adventurous
and lawless fancy it was a chain of audacious acts and unheard-of
disasters the moated fortress and the thicket the ambush and the
battle and the conflict of headlong passions were pourtrayed in
wild numbers and with terrific energy an afternoon was set apart to
rehearse this performance the language was familiar to all of us but
carwin whose company therefore was tacitly dispensed with

the morning previous to this intended rehearsal i spent at home my
mind was occupied with reflections relative to my own situation the
sentiment which lived with chief energy in my heart was connected
with the image of pleyel in the midst of my anguish i had not been
destitute of consolation his late deportment had given spring to my
hopes was not the hour at hand which should render me the happiest
of human creatures he suspected that i looked with favorable eyes upon
carwin hence arose disquietudes which he struggled in vain to conceal
he loved me but was hopeless that his love would be compensated is it
not time said i to rectify this error but by what means is this to be
effected it can only be done by a change of deportment in me but how
must i demean myself for this purpose

i must not speak neither eyes nor lips must impart the information
he must not be assured that my heart is his previous to the tender of
his own but he must be convinced that it has not been given to another
he must be supplied with space whereon to build a doubt as to the true
state of my affections he must be prompted to avow himself the line
of delicate propriety how hard it is not to fall short and not to
overleap it

this afternoon we shall meet at the temple we shall not separate till
late it will be his province to accompany me home the airy expanse is
without a speck this breeze is usually stedfast and its promise of
a bland and cloudless evening may be trusted the moon will rise at
eleven and at that hour we shall wind along this bank possibly that
hour may decide my fate if suitable encouragement be given pleyel will
reveal his soul to me and i ere i reach this threshold will be made
the happiest of beings and is this good to be mine add wings to thy
speed sweet evening and thou moon i charge thee shroud thy beams at
the moment when my pleyel whispers love i would not for the world that
the burning blushes and the mounting raptures of that moment should be
visible

but what encouragement is wanting i must be regardful of insurmountable
limits yet when minds are imbued with a genuine sympathy are not words
and looks superfluous are not motion and touch sufficient to impart
feelings such as mine has he not eyed me at moments when the pressure
of his hand has thrown me into tumults and was it possible that he
mistook the impetuosities of love for the eloquence of indignation

but the hastening evening will decide would it were come and yet i
shudder at its near approach an interview that must thus terminate is
surely to be wished for by me and yet it is not without its terrors
would to heaven it were come and gone

i feel no reluctance my friends to be thus explicit time was when
these emotions would be hidden with immeasurable solicitude from every
human eye alas these airy and fleeting impulses of shame are gone my
scruples were preposterous and criminal they are bred in all hearts by
a perverse and vicious education and they would still have maintained
their place in my heart had not my portion been set in misery my
errors have taught me thus much wisdom that those sentiments which we
ought not to disclose it is criminal to harbour

it was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four o'clock i counted the
minutes as they passed their flight was at once too rapid and too slow
my sensations were of an excruciating kind i could taste no food nor
apply to any task nor enjoy a moment's repose when the hour arrived i
hastened to my brother's

pleyel was not there he had not yet come on ordinary occasions he was
eminent for punctuality he had testified great eagerness to share
in the pleasures of this rehearsal he was to divide the task with my
brother and in tasks like these he always engaged with peculiar
zeal his elocution was less sweet than sonorous and therefore
better adapted than the mellifluences of his friend to the outrageous
vehemence of this drama

what could detain him perhaps he lingered through forgetfulness yet
this was incredible never had his memory been known to fail upon even
more trivial occasions not less impossible was it that the scheme had
lost its attractions and that he staid because his coming would afford
him no gratification but why should we expect him to adhere to the
minute

an half hour elapsed but pleyel was still at a distance perhaps he had
misunderstood the hour which had been proposed perhaps he had conceived
that to-morrow and not to-day had been selected for this purpose
but no a review of preceding circumstances demonstrated that such
misapprehension was impossible for he had himself proposed this day
and this hour this day his attention would not otherwise be occupied
but to-morrow an indispensible engagement was foreseen by which all
his time would be engrossed his detention therefore must be owing
to some unforeseen and extraordinary event our conjectures were vague
tumultuous and sometimes fearful his sickness and his death might
possibly have detained him

tortured with suspense we sat gazing at each other and at the path
which led from the road every horseman that passed was for a moment
imagined to be him hour succeeded hour and the sun gradually
declining at length disappeared every signal of his coming proved
fallacious and our hopes were at length dismissed his absence affected
my friends in no insupportable degree they should be obliged they
said to defer this undertaking till the morrow and perhaps their
impatient curiosity would compel them to dispense entirely with his
presence no doubt some harmless occurrence had diverted him from
his purpose and they trusted that they should receive a satisfactory
account of him in the morning

it may be supposed that this disappointment affected me in a very
different manner i turned aside my head to conceal my tears i fled
into solitude to give vent to my reproaches without interruption
or restraint my heart was ready to burst with indignation and grief
pleyel was not the only object of my keen but unjust upbraiding deeply
did i execrate my own folly thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric
which i had reared thus had my golden vision melted into air

how fondly did i dream that pleyel was a lover if he were would he
have suffered any obstacle to hinder his coming blind and infatuated
man i exclaimed thou sportest with happiness the good that is
offered thee thou hast the insolence and folly to refuse well i will
henceforth intrust my felicity to no one's keeping but my own

the first agonies of this disappointment would not allow me to be
reasonable or just every ground on which i had built the persuasion
that pleyel was not unimpressed in my favor appeared to vanish it
seemed as if i had been misled into this opinion by the most palpable
illusions

i made some trifling excuse and returned much earlier than i expected
to my own house i retired early to my chamber without designing to
sleep i placed myself at a window and gave the reins to reflection

the hateful and degrading impulses which had lately controuled me were
in some degree removed new dejection succeeded but was now produced
by contemplating my late behaviour surely that passion is worthy to
be abhorred which obscures our understanding and urges us to the
commission of injustice what right had i to expect his attendance
had i not demeaned myself like one indifferent to his happiness and as
having bestowed my regards upon another his absence might be prompted
by the love which i considered his absence as a proof that he wanted
he came not because the sight of me the spectacle of my coldness or
aversion contributed to his despair why should i prolong by hypocrisy
or silence his misery as well as my own why not deal with him
explicitly and assure him of the truth

you will hardly believe that in obedience to this suggestion i rose
for the purpose of ordering a light that i might instantly make this
confession in a letter a second thought shewed me the rashness of this
scheme and i wondered by what infirmity of mind i could be betrayed
into a momentary approbation of it i saw with the utmost clearness that
a confession like that would be the most remediless and unpardonable
outrage upon the dignity of my sex and utterly unworthy of that passion
which controuled me

i resumed my seat and my musing to account for the absence of pleyel
became once more the scope of my conjectures how many incidents might
occur to raise an insuperable impediment in his way when i was a child
a scheme of pleasure in which he and his sister were parties had been
in like manner frustrated by his absence but his absence in that
instance had been occasioned by his falling from a boat into the river
in consequence of which he had run the most imminent hazard of being
drowned here was a second disappointment endured by the same persons
and produced by his failure might it not originate in the same cause
had he not designed to cross the river that morning to make some
necessary purchases in jersey he had preconcerted to return to his
own house to dinner but perhaps some disaster had befallen him
experience had taught me the insecurity of a canoe and that was the
only kind of boat which pleyel used i was likewise actuated by
an hereditary dread of water these circumstances combined to bestow
considerable plausibility on this conjecture but the consternation
with which i began to be seized was allayed by reflecting that if
this disaster had happened my brother would have received the speediest
information of it the consolation which this idea imparted was ravished
from me by a new thought this disaster might have happened and his
family not be apprized of it the first intelligence of his fate may
be communicated by the livid corpse which the tide may cast many days
hence upon the shore

thus was i distressed by opposite conjectures thus was i tormented by
phantoms of my own creation it was not always thus i can ascertain the
date when my mind became the victim of this imbecility perhaps it was
coeval with the inroad of a fatal passion a passion that will never
rank me in the number of its eulogists it was alone sufficient to the
extermination of my peace it was itself a plenteous source of
calamity and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the
attractions of existence and dig for me an untimely grave

the state of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon
the dangers and cares which inevitably beset an human being by no
violent transition was i led to ponder on the turbulent life and
mysterious end of my father i cherished with the utmost veneration
the memory of this man and every relique connected with his fate was
preserved with the most scrupulous care among these was to be numbered
a manuscript containing memoirs of his own life the narrative was by
no means recommended by its eloquence but neither did all its value
flow from my relationship to the author its stile had an unaffected and
picturesque simplicity the great variety and circumstantial display of
the incidents together with their intrinsic importance as descriptive
of human manners and passions made it the most useful book in my
collection it was late but being sensible of no inclination to sleep
i resolved to betake myself to the perusal of it

to do this it was requisite to procure a light the girl had long since
retired to her chamber it was therefore proper to wait upon myself
a lamp and the means of lighting it were only to be found in the
kitchen thither i resolved forthwith to repair but the light was of
use merely to enable me to read the book i knew the shelf and the spot
where it stood whether i took down the book or prepared the lamp in
the first place appeared to be a matter of no moment the latter was
preferred and leaving my seat i approached the closet in which as i
mentioned formerly my books and papers were deposited

suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet
occurred whether midnight was approaching or had passed i knew not i
was as then alone and defenceless the wind was in that direction
in which aided by the deathlike repose of nature it brought to me
the murmur of the water-fall this was mingled with that solemn and
enchanting sound which a breeze produces among the leaves of pines the
words of that mysterious dialogue their fearful import and the wild
excess to which i was transported by my terrors filled my imagination
anew my steps faultered and i stood a moment to recover myself

i prevailed on myself at length to move towards the closet i touched
the lock but my fingers were powerless i was visited afresh by
unconquerable apprehensions a sort of belief darted into my mind that
some being was concealed within whose purposes were evil i began to
contend with those fears when it occurred to me that i might without
impropriety go for a lamp previously to opening the closet i receded
a few steps but before i reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new
direction motion seemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me i
was ashamed of my weakness besides what aid could be afforded me by a
lamp

my fears had pictured to themselves no precise object it would be
difficult to depict in words the ingredients and hues of that phantom
which haunted me an hand invisible and of preternatural strength
lifted by human passions and selecting my life for its aim were parts
of this terrific image all places were alike accessible to this foe or
if his empire were restricted by local bounds those bounds were utterly
inscrutable by me but had i not been told by some one in league with
this enemy that every place but the recess in the bank was exempt from
danger i returned to the closet and once more put my hand upon the
lock o may my ears lose their sensibility ere they be again assailed
by a shriek so terrible not merely my understanding was subdued by the
sound it acted on my nerves like an edge of steel it appeared to cut
asunder the fibres of my brain and rack every joint with agony

the cry loud and piercing as it was was nevertheless human no
articulation was ever more distinct the breath which accompanied it did
not fan my hair yet did every circumstance combine to persuade me that
the lips which uttered it touched my very shoulder

hold hold were the words of this tremendous prohibition in whose
tone the whole soul seemed to be wrapped up and every energy converted
into eagerness and terror

shuddering i dashed myself against the wall and by the same
involuntary impulse turned my face backward to examine the mysterious
monitor the moon-light streamed into each window and every corner of
the room was conspicuous and yet i beheld nothing

the interval was too brief to be artificially measured between the
utterance of these words and my scrutiny directed to the quarter whence
they came yet if a human being had been there could he fail to have
been visible which of my senses was the prey of a fatal illusion the
shock which the sound produced was still felt in every part of my frame
the sound therefore could not but be a genuine commotion but that i
had heard it was not more true than that the being who uttered it was
stationed at my right ear yet my attendant was invisible

i cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that moment surprize
had mastered my faculties my frame shook and the vital current was
congealed i was conscious only to the vehemence of my sensations this
condition could not be lasting like a tide which suddenly mounts to
an overwhelming height and then gradually subsides my confusion slowly
gave place to order and my tumults to a calm i was able to deliberate
and move i resumed my feet and advanced into the midst of the room
upward and behind and on each side i threw penetrating glances i was
not satisfied with one examination he that hitherto refused to be
seen might change his purpose and on the next survey be clearly
distinguishable

solitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy dark is less fertile
of images than the feeble lustre of the moon i was alone and the walls
were chequered by shadowy forms as the moon passed behind a cloud and
emerged these shadows seemed to be endowed with life and to move the
apartment was open to the breeze and the curtain was occasionally
blown from its ordinary position this motion was not unaccompanied with
sound i failed not to snatch a look and to listen when this motion
and this sound occurred my belief that my monitor was posted near
was strong and instantly converted these appearances to tokens of his
presence and yet i could discern nothing

when my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the past the
first idea that occurred was the resemblance between the words of the
voice which i had just heard and those which had terminated my dream in
the summer-house there are means by which we are able to distinguish a
substance from a shadow a reality from the phantom of a dream the pit
my brother beckoning me forward the seizure of my arm and the voice
behind were surely imaginary that these incidents were fashioned in my
sleep is supported by the same indubitable evidence that compels me to
believe myself awake at present yet the words and the voice were the
same then by some inexplicable contrivance i was aware of the danger
while my actions and sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted
with it now was it not equally true that my actions and persuasions
were at war had not the belief that evil lurked in the closet gained
admittance and had not my actions betokened an unwarrantable security
to obviate the effects of my infatuation the same means had been used

in my dream he that tempted me to my destruction was my brother death
was ambushed in my path from what evil was i now rescued what minister
or implement of ill was shut up in this recess who was it whose
suffocating grasp i was to feel should i dare to enter it what
monstrous conception is this my brother

no protection and not injury is his province strange and terrible
chimera yet it would not be suddenly dismissed it was surely no vulgar
agency that gave this form to my fears he to whom all parts of time are
equally present whom no contingency approaches was the author of that
spell which now seized upon me life was dear to me no consideration
was present that enjoined me to relinquish it sacred duty combined
with every spontaneous sentiment to endear to me my being should i not
shudder when my being was endangered but what emotion should possess me
when the arm lifted aginst me was wieland's

ideas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no established
laws why did i dream that my brother was my foe why but because an
omen of my fate was ordained to be communicated yet what salutary end
did it serve did it arm me with caution to elude or fortitude to bear
the evils to which i was reserved my present thoughts were no
doubt indebted for their hue to the similitude existing between these
incidents and those of my dream surely it was phrenzy that dictated my
deed that a ruffian was hidden in the closet was an idea the genuine
tendency of which was to urge me to flight such had been the effect
formerly produced had my mind been simply occupied with this thought at
present no doubt the same impulse would have been experienced but
now it was my brother whom i was irresistably persuaded to regard as the
contriver of that ill of which i had been forewarned this persuasion
did not extenuate my fears or my danger why then did i again approach
the closet and withdraw the bolt my resolution was instantly conceived
and executed without faultering

the door was formed of light materials the lock of simple structure
easily forewent its hold it opened into the room and commonly moved
upon its hinges after being unfastened without any effort of mine
this effort however was bestowed upon the present occasion it was
my purpose to open it with quickness but the exertion which i made was
ineffectual it refused to open

at another time this circumstance would not have looked with a face of
mystery i should have supposed some casual obstruction and repeated my
efforts to surmount it but now my mind was accessible to no conjecture
but one the door was hindered from opening by human force surely here
was new cause for affright this was confirmation proper to decide my
conduct now was all ground of hesitation taken away what could be
supposed but that i deserted the chamber and the house that i at least
endeavoured no longer to withdraw the door

have i not said that my actions were dictated by phrenzy my reason had
forborne for a time to suggest or to sway my resolves i reiterated
my endeavours i exerted all my force to overcome the obstacle but in
vain the strength that was exerted to keep it shut was superior to
mine

a casual observer might perhaps applaud the audaciousness of this
conduct whence but from an habitual defiance of danger could my
perseverance arise i have already assigned as distinctly as i am able
the cause of it the frantic conception that my brother was within that
the resistance made to my design was exerted by him had rooted itself
in my mind you will comprehend the height of this infatuation when
i tell you that finding all my exertions vain i betook myself to
exclamations surely i was utterly bereft of understanding

now had i arrived at the crisis of my fate o hinder not the door to
open i exclaimed in a tone that had less of fear than of grief in
it i know you well come forth but harm me not i beseech you come
forth

i had taken my hand from the lock and removed to a small distance from
the door i had scarcely uttered these words when the door swung upon
its hinges and displayed to my view the interior of the closet whoever
was within was shrouded in darkness a few seconds passed without
interruption of the silence i knew not what to expect or to fear my
eyes would not stray from the recess presently a deep sigh was heard
the quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness of my gaze some
one approached from the farther end i quickly perceived the outlines
of a human figure its steps were irresolute and slow i recoiled as it
advanced

by coming at length within the verge of the room his form was clearly
distinguishable i had prefigured to myself a very different personage
the face that presented itself was the last that i should desire to meet
at an hour and in a place like this my wonder was stifled by my fears
assassins had lurked in this recess some divine voice warned me of
danger that at this moment awaited me i had spurned the intimation
and challenged my adversary

i recalled the mysterious countenance and dubious character of carwin
what motive but atrocious ones could guide his steps hither i was
alone my habit suited the hour and the place and the warmth of the
season all succour was remote he had placed himself between me and the
door my frame shook with the vehemence of my apprehensions

yet i was not wholly lost to myself i vigilantly marked his demeanour
his looks were grave but not without perturbation what species of
inquietude it betrayed the light was not strong enough to enable me
to discover he stood still but his eyes wandered from one object to
another when these powerful organs were fixed upon me i shrunk into
myself at length he broke silence earnestness and not embarrassment
was in his tone he advanced close to me while he spoke

what voice was that which lately addressed you

he paused for an answer but observing my trepidation he resumed with
undiminished solemnity be not terrified whoever he was he hast done
you an important service i need not ask you if it were the voice of
a companion that sound was beyond the compass of human organs the
knowledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the closet was
obtained by incomprehensible means

you knew that carwin was there were you not apprized of his intents
the same power could impart the one as well as the other yet knowing
these you persisted audacious girl but perhaps you confided in his
guardianship your confidence was just with succour like this at hand
you may safely defy me

he is my eternal foe the baffler of my best concerted schemes twice
have you been saved by his accursed interposition but for him i should
long ere now have borne away the spoils of your honor

he looked at me with greater stedfastness than before i became every
moment more anxious for my safety it was with difficulty i stammered
out an entreaty that he would instantly depart or suffer me to do so
he paid no regard to my request but proceeded in a more impassioned
manner

what is it you fear have i not told you you are safe has not one
in whom you more reasonably place trust assured you of it even if i
execute my purpose what injury is done your prejudices will call it
by that name but it merits it not i was impelled by a sentiment that
does you honor a sentiment that would sanctify my deed but whatever
it be you are safe be this chimera still worshipped i will do nothing
to pollute it there he stopped

the accents and gestures of this man left me drained of all courage
surely on no other occasion should i have been thus pusillanimous my
state i regarded as a hopeless one i was wholly at the mercy of this
being whichever way i turned my eyes i saw no avenue by which i might
escape the resources of my personal strength my ingenuity and my
eloquence i estimated at nothing the dignity of virtue and the force
of truth i had been accustomed to celebrate and had frequently vaunted
of the conquests which i should make with their assistance

i used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a being in
possession of a sound mind that true virtue supplies us with energy
which vice can never resist that it was always in our power to
obstruct by his own death the designs of an enemy who aimed at less
than our life how was it that a sentiment like despair had now invaded
me and that i trusted to the protection of chance or to the pity of my
persecutor

his words imparted some notion of the injury which he had meditated he
talked of obstacles that had risen in his way he had relinquished his
design these sources supplied me with slender consolation there was no
security but in his absence when i looked at myself when i reflected
on the hour and the place i was overpowered by horror and dejection

he was silent museful and inattentive to my situation yet made no
motion to depart i was silent in my turn what could i say i was
confident that reason in this contest would be impotent i must owe my
safety to his own suggestions whatever purpose brought him hither he
had changed it why then did he remain his resolutions might fluctuate
and the pause of a few minutes restore to him his first resolutions

yet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindness
whose society was endeared to us by his intellectual elevation and
accomplishments who had a thousand times expatiated on the usefulness
and beauty of virtue why should such a one be dreaded if i could have
forgotten the circumstances in which our interview had taken place i
might have treated his words as jests presently he resumed

fear me not the space that severs us is small and all visible succour
is distant you believe yourself completely in my power that you stand
upon the brink of ruin such are your groundless fears i cannot lift
a finger to hurt you easier it would be to stop the moon in her course
than to injure you the power that protects you would crumble my sinews
and reduce me to a heap of ashes in a moment if i were to harbour a
thought hostile to your safety thus are appearances at length solved
little did i expect that they originated hence what a portion is
assigned to you scanned by the eyes of this intelligence your path
will be without pits to swallow or snares to entangle you environed by
the arms of this protection all artifices will be frustrated and all
malice repelled

here succeeded a new pause i was still observant of every gesture and
look the tranquil solemnity that had lately possessed his countenance
gave way to a new expression all now was trepidation and anxiety

i must be gone said he in a faltering accent why do i linger here
i will not ask your forgiveness i see that your terrors are invincible
your pardon will be extorted by fear and not dictated by compassion i
must fly from you forever he that could plot against your honor must
expect from you and your friends persecution and death i must doom
myself to endless exile

saying this he hastily left the room i listened while he descended the
stairs and unbolting the outer door went forth i did not follow him
with my eyes as the moon-light would have enabled me to do relieved by
his absence and exhausted by the conflict of my fears i threw myself
on a chair and resigned myself to those bewildering ideas which
incidents like these could not fail to produce



chapter x


order could not readily be introduced into my thoughts the voice still
rung in my ears every accent that was uttered by carwin was fresh in my
remembrance his unwelcome approach the recognition of his person his
hasty departure produced a complex impression on my mind which no words
can delineate i strove to give a slower motion to my thoughts and to
regulate a confusion which became painful but my efforts were nugatory
i covered my eyes with my hand and sat i know not how long without
power to arrange or utter my conceptions

i had remained for hours as i believed in absolute solitude no
thought of personal danger had molested my tranquillity i had made
no preparation for defence what was it that suggested the design of
perusing my father's manuscript if instead of this i had retired
to bed and to sleep to what fate might i not have been reserved the
ruffian who must almost have suppressed his breathing to screen himself
from discovery would have noticed this signal and i should have
awakened only to perish with affright and to abhor myself could i have
remained unconscious of my danger could i have tranquilly slept in the
midst of so deadly a snare

and who was he that threatened to destroy me by what means could he
hide himself in this closet surely he is gifted with supernatural
power such is the enemy of whose attempts i was forewarned daily i had
seen him and conversed with him nothing could be discerned through the
impenetrable veil of his duplicity when busied in conjectures as to
the author of the evil that was threatened my mind did not light for
a moment upon his image yet has he not avowed himself my enemy why
should he be here if he had not meditated evil

he confesses that this has been his second attempt what was the scene
of his former conspiracy was it not he whose whispers betrayed him am
i deceived or was there not a faint resemblance between the voice of
this man and that which talked of grasping my throat and extinguishing
my life in a moment then he had a colleague in his crime now he
is alone then death was the scope of his thoughts now an injury
unspeakably more dreadful how thankful should i be to the power that
has interposed to save me

that power is invisible it is subject to the cognizance of one of my
senses what are the means that will inform me of what nature it is
he has set himself to counterwork the machinations of this man who had
menaced destruction to all that is dear to me and whose cunning had
surmounted every human impediment there was none to rescue me from
his grasp my rashness even hastened the completion of his scheme and
precluded him from the benefits of deliberation i had robbed him of the
power to repent and forbear had i been apprized of the danger i should
have regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my escape from it
impossible such likewise seem to have been the fears of my invisible
protector else why that startling intreaty to refrain from opening the
closet by what inexplicable infatuation was i compelled to proceed

yet my conduct was wise carwin unable to comprehend my folly ascribed
my behaviour to my knowledge he conceived himself previously detected
and such detection being possible to flow only from my heavenly friend
and his enemy his fears acquired additional strength

he is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being perhaps he
is a human agent yet on that supposition his atchievements are
incredible why should i be selected as the object of his care or if
a mere mortal should i not recognize some one whom benefits imparted
and received had prompted to love me what were the limits and duration
of his guardianship was the genius of my birth entrusted by divine
benignity with this province are human faculties adequate to
receive stronger proofs of the existence of unfettered and beneficent
intelligences than i have received

but who was this man's coadjutor the voice that acknowledged an
alliance in treachery with carwin warned me to avoid the summer-house
he assured me that there only my safety was endangered his assurance
as it now appears was fallacious was there not deceit in his
admonition was his compact really annulled some purpose was perhaps
to be accomplished by preventing my future visits to that spot why was
i enjoined silence to others on the subject of this admonition unless
it were for some unauthorized and guilty purpose

no one but myself was accustomed to visit it backward it was hidden
from distant view by the rock and in front it was screened from all
examination by creeping plants and the branches of cedars what
recess could be more propitious to secrecy the spirit which haunted it
formerly was pure and rapturous it was a fane sacred to the memory
of infantile days and to blissful imaginations of the future what a
gloomy reverse had succeeded since the ominous arrival of this stranger
now perhaps it is the scene of his meditations purposes fraught with
horror that shun the light and contemplate the pollution of innocence
are here engendered and fostered and reared to maturity

such were the ideas that during the night were tumultuously revolved
by me i reviewed every conversation in which carwin had borne a part
i studied to discover the true inferences deducible from his deportment
and words with regard to his former adventures and actual views i
pondered on the comments which he made on the relation which i had given
of the closet dialogue no new ideas suggested themselves in the course
of this review my expectation had from the first been disappointed
on the small degree of surprize which this narrative excited in him he
never explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of those voices
or decided whether they were real or visionary he recommended no
measures of caution or prevention

but what measures were now to be taken was the danger which threatened
me at an end had i nothing more to fear i was lonely and without
means of defence i could not calculate the motives and regulate the
footsteps of this person what certainty was there that he would not
re-assume his purposes and swiftly return to the execution of them

this idea covered me once more with dismay how deeply did i regret the
solitude in which i was placed and how ardently did i desire the return
of day but neither of these inconveniencies were susceptible of remedy
at first it occurred to me to summon my servant and make her spend the
night in my chamber but the inefficacy of this expedient to enhance my
safety was easily seen once i resolved to leave the house and retire
to my brother's but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness
of the hour on the alarm which my arrival and the account which i
should be obliged to give might occasion and on the danger to which i
might expose myself in the way thither i began likewise to consider
carwin's return to molest me as exceedingly improbable he had
relinquished of his own accord his design and departed without
compulsion surely said i there is omnipotence in the cause that
changed the views of a man like carwin the divinity that shielded me
from his attempts will take suitable care of my future safety thus to
yield to my fears is to deserve that they should be real

scarcely had i uttered these words when my attention was startled by
the sound of footsteps they denoted some one stepping into the piazza
in front of my house my new-born confidence was extinguished in a
moment carwin i thought had repented his departure and was hastily
returning the possibility that his return was prompted by intentions
consistent with my safety found no place in my mind images of
violation and murder assailed me anew and the terrors which succeeded
almost incapacitated me from taking any measures for my defence it was
an impulse of which i was scarcely conscious that made me fasten the
lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door having done this i threw
myself on a seat for i trembled to a degree which disabled me from
standing and my soul was so perfectly absorbed in the act of listening
that almost the vital motions were stopped

the door below creaked on its hinges it was not again thrust to but
appeared to remain open footsteps entered traversed the entry and
began to mount the stairs how i detested the folly of not pursuing the
man when he withdrew and bolting after him the outer door might he not
conceive this omission to be a proof that my angel had deserted me and
be thereby fortified in guilt

every step on the stairs which brought him nearer to my chamber added
vigor to my desperation the evil with which i was menaced was to be at
any rate eluded how little did i preconceive the conduct which in an
exigence like this i should be prone to adopt you will suppose that
deliberation and despair would have suggested the same course of action
and that i should have unhesitatingly resorted to the best means of
personal defence within my power a penknife lay open upon my table i
remembered that it was there and seized it for what purpose you will
scarcely inquire it will be immediately supposed that i meant it for my
last refuge and that if all other means should fail i should plunge it
into the heart of my ravisher

i have lost all faith in the stedfastness of human resolves it was thus
that in periods of calm i had determined to act no cowardice had been
held by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted an injured
female to destroy not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated but
herself when it was without remedy yet now this penknife appeared to
me of no other use than to baffle my assailant and prevent the crime
by destroying myself to deliberate at such a time was impossible but
among the tumultuous suggestions of the moment i do not recollect that
it once occurred to me to use it as an instrument of direct defence the
steps had now reached the second floor every footfall accelerated the
completion without augmenting the certainty of evil the consciousness
that the door was fast now that nothing but that was interposed between
me and danger was a source of some consolation i cast my eye towards
the window this likewise was a new suggestion if the door should
give way it was my sudden resolution to throw myself from the window
its height from the ground which was covered beneath by a brick
pavement would insure my destruction but i thought not of that

when opposite to my door the footsteps ceased was he listening whether
my fears were allayed and my caution were asleep did he hope to take
me by surprize yet if so why did he allow so many noisy signals to
betray his approach presently the steps were again heard to approach
the door an hand was laid upon the lock and the latch pulled back did
he imagine it possible that i should fail to secure the door a slight
effort was made to push it open as if all bolts being withdrawn a
slight effort only was required

i no sooner perceived this than i moved swiftly towards the window
carwin's frame might be said to be all muscle his strength and activity
had appeared in various instances to be prodigious a slight exertion
of his force would demolish the door would not that exertion be made
too surely it would but at the same moment that this obstacle should
yield and he should enter the apartment my determination was formed to
leap from the window my senses were still bound to this object i gazed
at the door in momentary expectation that the assault would be made the
pause continued the person without was irresolute and motionless

suddenly it occurred to me that carwin might conceive me to have fled
that i had not betaken myself to flight was indeed the least probable
of all conclusions in this persuasion he must have been confirmed on
finding the lower door unfastened and the chamber door locked was
it not wise to foster this persuasion should i maintain deep silence
this in addition to other circumstances might encourage the belief
and he would once more depart every new reflection added plausibility
to this reasoning it was presently more strongly enforced when i
noticed footsteps withdrawing from the door the blood once more flowed
back to my heart and a dawn of exultation began to rise but my joy was
short lived instead of descending the stairs he passed to the door of
the opposite chamber opened it and having entered shut it after him
with a violence that shook the house

how was i to interpret this circumstance for what end could he have
entered this chamber did the violence with which he closed the door
testify the depth of his vexation this room was usually occupied by
pleyel was carwin aware of his absence on this night could he be
suspected of a design so sordid as pillage if this were his view there
were no means in my power to frustrate it it behoved me to seize the
first opportunity to escape but if my escape were supposed by my
enemy to have been already effected no asylum was more secure than the
present how could my passage from the house be accomplished without
noises that might incite him to pursue me

utterly at a loss to account for his going into pleyel's chamber i
waited in instant expectation of hearing him come forth all however
was profoundly still i listened in vain for a considerable period to
catch the sound of the door when it should again be opened there was
no other avenue by which he could escape but a door which led into the
girl's chamber would any evil from this quarter befall the girl

hence arose a new train of apprehensions they merely added to the
turbulence and agony of my reflections whatever evil impended over her
i had no power to avert it seclusion and silence were the only means of
saving myself from the perils of this fatal night what solemn vows did
i put up that if i should once more behold the light of day i would
never trust myself again within the threshold of this dwelling

minute lingered after minute but no token was given that carwin had
returned to the passage what i again asked could detain him in this
room was it possible that he had returned and glided unperceived
away i was speedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprize
like this and yet as if by that means i were capable of gaining any
information on that head i cast anxious looks from the window

the object that first attracted my attention was an human figure
standing on the edge of the bank perhaps my penetration was assisted
by my hopes be that as it will the figure of carwin was clearly
distinguishable from the obscurity of my station it was impossible
that i should be discerned by him and yet he scarcely suffered me to
catch a glimpse of him he turned and went down the steep which in
this part was not difficult to be scaled

my conjecture then had been right carwin has softly opened the door
descended the stairs and issued forth that i should not have overheard
his steps was only less incredible than that my eyes had deceived me
but what was now to be done the house was at length delivered from this
detested inmate by one avenue might he again re-enter was it not wise
to bar the lower door perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door for
this end he must have passed through judith's chamber these entrances
being closed and bolted as great security was gained as was compatible
with my lonely condition

the propriety of these measures was too manifest not to make me struggle
successfully with my fears yet i opened my own door with the utmost
caution and descended as if i were afraid that carwin had been still
immured in pleyel's chamber the outer door was a-jar i shut with
trembling eagerness and drew every bolt that appended to it i then
passed with light and less cautious steps through the parlour but was
surprized to discover that the kitchen door was secure i was compelled
to acquiesce in the first conjecture that carwin had escaped through the
entry

my heart was now somewhat eased of the load of apprehension i returned
once more to my chamber the door of which i was careful to lock it was
no time to think of repose the moon-light began already to fade before
the light of the day the approach of morning was betokened by the usual
signals i mused upon the events of this night and determined to take
up my abode henceforth at my brother's whether i should inform him
of what had happened was a question which seemed to demand some
consideration my safety unquestionably required that i should abandon
my present habitation

as my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments the image of
pleyel and the dubiousness of his condition again recurred to me i
again ran over the possible causes of his absence on the preceding day
my mind was attuned to melancholy i dwelt with an obstinacy for which
i could not account on the idea of his death i painted to myself his
struggles with the billows and his last appearance i imagined myself
a midnight wanderer on the shore and to have stumbled on his corpse
which the tide had cast up these dreary images affected me even to
tears i endeavoured not to restrain them they imparted a relief which
i had not anticipated the more copiously they flowed the more did
my general sensations appear to subside into calm and a certain
restlessness give way to repose

perhaps relieved by this effusion the slumber so much wanted might
have stolen on my senses had there been no new cause of alarm



chapter xi


i was aroused from this stupor by sounds that evidently arose in the
next chamber was it possible that i had been mistaken in the figure
which i had seen on the bank or had carwin by some inscrutable means
penetrated once more into this chamber the opposite door opened
footsteps came forth and the person advancing to mine knocked

so unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence of mind and
starting up i involuntarily exclaimed who is there an answer was
immediately given the voice to my inexpressible astonishment was
pleyel's

it is i have you risen if you have not make haste i want three
minutes conversation with you in the parlour i will wait for you
there saying this he retired from the door

should i confide in the testimony of my ears if that were true it was
pleyel that had been hitherto immured in the opposite chamber he whom
my rueful fancy had depicted in so many ruinous and ghastly shapes he
whose footsteps had been listened to with such inquietude what is man
that knowledge is so sparingly conferred upon him that his heart should
be wrung with distress and his frame be exanimated with fear though
his safety be encompassed with impregnable walls what are the bounds
of human imbecility he that warned me of the presence of my foe refused
the intimation by which so many racking fears would have been precluded

yet who would have imagined the arrival of pleyel at such an hour his
tone was desponding and anxious why this unseasonable summons and why
this hasty departure some tidings he perhaps bears of mysterious and
unwelcome import

my impatience would not allow me to consume much time in deliberation i
hastened down pleyel i found standing at a window with eyes cast
down as in meditation and arms folded on his breast every line in
his countenance was pregnant with sorrow to this was added a certain
wanness and air of fatigue the last time i had seen him appearances
had been the reverse of these i was startled at the change the first
impulse was to question him as to the cause this impulse was supplanted
by some degree of confusion flowing from a consciousness that love had
too large and as it might prove a perceptible share in creating this
impulse i was silent

presently he raised his eyes and fixed them upon me i read in them an
anguish altogether ineffable never had i witnessed a like demeanour
in pleyel never indeed had i observed an human countenance in which
grief was more legibly inscribed he seemed struggling for utterance
but his struggles being fruitless he shook his head and turned away
from me

my impatience would not allow me to be longer silent what said i
for heaven's sake my friend what is the matter

he started at the sound of my voice his looks for a moment became
convulsed with an emotion very different from grief his accents were
broken with rage

the matter o wretch thus exquisitely fashioned on whom nature
seemed to have exhausted all her graces with charms so awful and
so pure how art thou fallen from what height fallen a ruin so
complete so unheard of

his words were again choaked by emotion grief and pity were again
mingled in his features he resumed in a tone half suffocated by sobs

but why should i upbraid thee could i restore to thee what thou hast
lost efface this cursed stain snatch thee from the jaws of this fiend
i would do it yet what will avail my efforts i have not arms with
which to contend with so consummate so frightful a depravity

evidence less than this would only have excited resentment and scorn
the wretch who should have breathed a suspicion injurious to thy honor
would have been regarded without anger not hatred or envy could have
prompted him it would merely be an argument of madness that my eyes
that my ears should bear witness to thy fall by no other way could
detestible conviction be imparted

why do i summon thee to this conference why expose myself to thy
derision here admonition and entreaty are vain thou knowest him
already for a murderer and thief i had thought to have been the first
to disclose to thee his infamy to have warned thee of the pit to
which thou art hastening but thy eyes are open in vain o foul and
insupportable disgrace

there is but one path i know you will disappear together in thy ruin
how will the felicity and honor of multitudes be involved but it must
come this scene shall not be blotted by his presence no doubt thou
wilt shortly see thy detested paramour this scene will be again
polluted by a midnight assignation inform him of his danger tell him
that his crimes are known let him fly far and instantly from this spot
if he desires to avoid the fate which menaced him in ireland

and wilt thou not stay behind but shame upon my weakness i know
not what i would say i have done what i purposed to stay longer to
expostulate to beseech to enumerate the consequences of thy act what
end can it serve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our woes and
yet o think think ere it be too late on the distresses which thy
flight will entail upon us on the base grovelling and atrocious
character of the wretch to whom thou hast sold thy honor but what
is this is not thy effrontery impenetrable and thy heart thoroughly
cankered o most specious and most profligate of women

saying this he rushed out of the house i saw him in a few moments
hurrying along the path which led to my brother's i had no power to
prevent his going or to recall or to follow him the accents i had
heard were calculated to confound and bewilder i looked around me to
assure myself that the scene was real i moved that i might banish the
doubt that i was awake such enormous imputations from the mouth of
pleyel to be stigmatized with the names of wanton and profligate to
be charged with the sacrifice of honor with midnight meetings with a
wretch known to be a murderer and thief with an intention to fly in his
company

what i had heard was surely the dictate of phrenzy or it was built
upon some fatal some incomprehensible mistake after the horrors of the
night after undergoing perils so imminent from this man to be summoned
to an interview like this to find pleyel fraught with a belief that
instead of having chosen death as a refuge from the violence of this
man i had hugged his baseness to my heart had sacrificed for him my
purity my spotless name my friendships and my fortune that even
madness could engender accusations like these was not to be believed

what evidence could possibly suggest conceptions so wild after the
unlooked-for interview with carwin in my chamber he retired could
pleyel have observed his exit it was not long after that pleyel himself
entered did he build on this incident his odious conclusions could
the long series of my actions and sentiments grant me no exemption from
suspicions so foul was it not more rational to infer that carwin's
designs had been illicit that my life had been endangered by the fury
of one whom by some means he had discovered to be an assassin and
robber that my honor had been assailed not by blandishments but by
violence

he has judged me without hearing he has drawn from dubious appearances
conclusions the most improbable and unjust he has loaded me with all
outrageous epithets he has ranked me with prostitutes and thieves i
cannot pardon thee pleyel for this injustice thy understanding must
be hurt if it be not if thy conduct was sober and deliberate i can
never forgive an outrage so unmanly and so gross

these thoughts gradually gave place to others pleyel was possessed by
some momentary phrenzy appearances had led him into palpable errors
whence could his sagacity have contracted this blindness was it not
love previously assured of my affection for carwin distracted with
grief and jealousy and impelled hither at that late hour by some
unknown instigation his imagination transformed shadows into monsters
and plunged him into these deplorable errors

this idea was not unattended with consolation my soul was divided
between indignation at his injustice and delight on account of the
source from which i conceived it to spring for a long time they would
allow admission to no other thoughts surprize is an emotion that
enfeebles not invigorates all my meditations were accompanied
with wonder i rambled with vagueness or clung to one image with an
obstinacy which sufficiently testified the maddening influence of late
transactions

gradually i proceeded to reflect upon the consequences of pleyel's
mistake and on the measures i should take to guard myself against
future injury from carwin should i suffer this mistake to be detected
by time when his passion should subside would he not perceive the
flagrancy of his injustice and hasten to atone for it did it not
become my character to testify resentment for language and treatment so
opprobrious wrapt up in the consciousness of innocence and confiding
in the influence of time and reflection to confute so groundless a
charge it was my province to be passive and silent

as to the violences meditated by carwin and the means of eluding them
the path to be taken by me was obvious i resolved to tell the tale to
my brother and regulate myself by his advice for this end when the
morning was somewhat advanced i took the way to his house my sister
was engaged in her customary occupations as soon as i appeared she
remarked a change in my looks i was not willing to alarm her by the
information which i had to communicate her health was in that condition
which rendered a disastrous tale particularly unsuitable i forbore a
direct answer to her inquiries and inquired in my turn for wieland

why said she i suspect something mysterious and unpleasant has
happened this morning scarcely had we risen when pleyel dropped among
us what could have prompted him to make us so early and so unseasonable
a visit i cannot tell to judge from the disorder of his dress and
his countenance something of an extraordinary nature has occurred he
permitted me merely to know that he had slept none nor even undressed
during the past night he took your brother to walk with him some
topic must have deeply engaged them for wieland did not return till
the breakfast hour was passed and returned alone his disturbance was
excessive but he would not listen to my importunities or tell me
what had happened i gathered from hints which he let fall that your
situation was in some way the cause yet he assured me that you were
at your own house alive in good health and in perfect safety he
scarcely ate a morsel and immediately after breakfast went out again
he would not inform me whither he was going but mentioned that he
probably might not return before night

i was equally astonished and alarmed by this information pleyel had
told his tale to my brother and had by a plausible and exaggerated
picture instilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me yet would not
the more correct judgment of wieland perceive and expose the fallacy of
his conclusions perhaps his uneasiness might arise from some insight
into the character of carwin and from apprehensions for my safety the
appearances by which pleyel had been misled might induce him likewise
to believe that i entertained an indiscreet though not dishonorable
affection for carwin such were the conjectures rapidly formed i was
inexpressibly anxious to change them into certainty for this end
an interview with my brother was desirable he was gone no one knew
whither and was not expected speedily to return i had no clue by which
to trace his footsteps

my anxieties could not be concealed from my sister they heightened
her solicitude to be acquainted with the cause there were many reasons
persuading me to silence at least till i had seen my brother it would
be an act of inexcusable temerity to unfold what had lately passed no
other expedient for eluding her importunities occurred to me but that
of returning to my own house i recollected my determination to become a
tenant of this roof i mentioned it to her she joyfully acceded to this
proposal and suffered me with less reluctance to depart when i told
her that it was with a view to collect and send to my new dwelling what
articles would be immediately useful to me

once more i returned to the house which had been the scene of so
much turbulence and danger i was at no great distance from it when
i observed my brother coming out on seeing me he stopped and after
ascertaining as it seemed which way i was going he returned into the
house before me i sincerely rejoiced at this event and i hastened to
set things if possible on their right footing

his brow was by no means expressive of those vehement emotions with
which pleyel had been agitated i drew a favorable omen from this
circumstance without delay i began the conversation

i have been to look for you said i but was told by catharine that
pleyel had engaged you on some important and disagreeable affair before
his interview with you he spent a few minutes with me these minutes he
employed in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which i am by
no means chargeable i believe him to have taken up his opinions on
very insufficient grounds his behaviour was in the highest degree
precipitate and unjust and until i receive some atonement i shall
treat him in my turn with that contempt which he justly merits
meanwhile i am fearful that he has prejudiced my brother against me
that is an evil which i most anxiously deprecate and which i shall
indeed exert myself to remove has he made me the subject of this
morning's conversation

my brother's countenance testified no surprize at my address the
benignity of his looks were no wise diminished

it is true said he your conduct was the subject of our discourse i
am your friend as well as your brother there is no human being whom i
love with more tenderness and whose welfare is nearer my heart judge
then with what emotions i listened to pleyel's story i expect and
desire you to vindicate yourself from aspersions so foul if vindication
be possible

the tone with which he uttered the last words affected me deeply if
vindication be possible repeated i from what you know do you deem a
formal vindication necessary can you harbour for a moment the belief of
my guilt

he shook his head with an air of acute anguish i have struggled said
he to dismiss that belief you speak before a judge who will profit by
any pretence to acquit you who is ready to question his own senses when
they plead against you

these words incited a new set of thoughts in my mind i began to suspect
that pleyel had built his accusations on some foundation unknown to me
i may be a stranger to the grounds of your belief pleyel loaded me
with indecent and virulent invectives but he withheld from me the facts
that generated his suspicions events took place last night of which
some of the circumstances were of an ambiguous nature i conceived that
these might possibly have fallen under his cognizance and that viewed
through the mists of prejudice and passion they supplied a pretence
for his conduct but believed that your more unbiassed judgment would
estimate them at their just value perhaps his tale has been different
from what i suspect it to be listen then to my narrative if there be
any thing in his story inconsistent with mine his story is false

i then proceeded to a circumstantial relation of the incidents of the
last night wieland listened with deep attention having finished
this continued i is the truth you see in what circumstances an
interview took place between carwin and me he remained for hours in my
closet and for some minutes in my chamber he departed without haste or
interruption if pleyel marked him as he left the house and it is
not impossible that he did inferences injurious to my character might
suggest themselves to him in admitting them he gave proofs of less
discernment and less candor than i once ascribed to him

his proofs said wieland after a considerable pause are different
that he should be deceived is not possible that he himself is not the
deceiver could not be believed if his testimony were not inconsistent
with yours but the doubts which i entertained are now removed your
tale some parts of it is marvellous the voice which exclaimed against
your rashness in approaching the closet your persisting notwithstanding
that prohibition your belief that i was the ruffian and your
subsequent conduct are believed by me because i have known you from
childhood because a thousand instances have attested your veracity and
because nothing less than my own hearing and vision would convince me
in opposition to her own assertions that my sister had fallen into
wickedness like this

i threw my arms around him and bathed his cheek with my tears that
said i is spoken like my brother but what are the proofs

he replied pleyel informed me that in going to your house his
attention was attracted by two voices the persons speaking sat beneath
the bank out of sight these persons judging by their voices were
carwin and you i will not repeat the dialogue if my sister was the
female pleyel was justified in concluding you to be indeed one of the
most profligate of women hence his accusations of you and his efforts
to obtain my concurrence to a plan by which an eternal separation should
be brought about between my sister and this man

i made wieland repeat this recital here indeed was a tale to fill me
with terrible foreboding i had vainly thought that my safety could be
sufficiently secured by doors and bars but this is a foe from whose
grasp no power of divinity can save me his artifices will ever lay my
fame and happiness at his mercy how shall i counterwork his plots or
detect his coadjutor he has taught some vile and abandoned female to
mimic my voice pleyel's ears were the witnesses of my dishonor this
is the midnight assignation to which he alluded thus is the silence
he maintained when attempting to open the door of my chamber accounted
for he supposed me absent and meant perhaps had my apartment been
accessible to leave in it some accusing memorial

pleyel was no longer equally culpable the sincerity of his anguish the
depth of his despair i remembered with some tendencies to gratitude
yet was he not precipitate was the conjecture that my part was played
by some mimic so utterly untenable instances of this faculty are
common the wickedness of carwin must in his opinion have been
adequate to such contrivances and yet the supposition of my guilt was
adopted in preference to that

but how was this error to be unveiled what but my own assertion had i
to throw in the balance against it would this be permitted to outweigh
the testimony of his senses i had no witnesses to prove my existence
in another place the real events of that night are marvellous few to
whom they should be related would scruple to discredit them pleyel is
sceptical in a transcendant degree i cannot summon carwin to my bar
and make him the attestor of my innocence and the accuser of himself

my brother saw and comprehended my distress he was unacquainted
however with the full extent of it he knew not by how many motives
i was incited to retrieve the good opinion of pleyel he endeavored
to console me some new event he said would occur to disentangle the
maze he did not question the influence of my eloquence if i thought
proper to exert it why not seek an interview with pleyel and exact
from him a minute relation in which something may be met with serving
to destroy the probability of the whole

i caught with eagerness at this hope but my alacrity was damped by
new reflections should i perfect in this respect and unblemished as
i was thrust myself uncalled into his presence and make my felicity
depend upon his arbitrary verdict

if you chuse to seek an interview continued wieland you must make
haste for pleyel informed me of his intention to set out this evening
or to-morrow on a long journey

no intelligence was less expected or less welcome than this i had
thrown myself in a window seat but now starting on my feet i
exclaimed good heavens what is it you say a journey whither when

i cannot say whither it is a sudden resolution i believe i did not
hear of it till this morning he promises to write to me as soon as he
is settled

i needed no further information as to the cause and issue of this
journey the scheme of happiness to which he had devoted his thoughts
was blasted by the discovery of last night my preference of another
and my unworthiness to be any longer the object of his adoration were
evinced by the same act and in the same moment the thought of utter
desertion a desertion originating in such a cause was the prelude to
distraction that pleyel should abandon me forever because i was blind
to his excellence because i coveted pollution and wedded infamy when
on the contrary my heart was the shrine of all purity and beat only
for his sake was a destiny which as long as my life was in my own
hands i would by no means consent to endure

i remembered that this evil was still preventable that this fatal
journey it was still in my power to procrastinate or perhaps to
occasion it to be laid aside there were no impediments to a visit i
only dreaded lest the interview should be too long delayed my brother
befriended my impatience and readily consented to furnish me with a
chaise and servant to attend me my purpose was to go immediately to
pleyel's farm where his engagements usually detained him during the
day



chapter xii


my way lay through the city i had scarcely entered it when i was seized
with a general sensation of sickness every object grew dim and swam
before my sight it was with difficulty i prevented myself from sinking
to the bottom of the carriage i ordered myself to be carried to mrs
baynton's in hope that an interval of repose would invigorate and
refresh me my distracted thoughts would allow me but little rest
growing somewhat better in the afternoon i resumed my journey

my contemplations were limited to a few objects i regarded my success
in the purpose which i had in view as considerably doubtful i
depended in some degree on the suggestions of the moment and on the
materials which pleyel himself should furnish me when i reflected on
the nature of the accusation i burned with disdain would not truth
and the consciousness of innocence render me triumphant should i not
cast from me with irresistible force such atrocious imputations

what an entire and mournful change has been effected in a few hours the
gulf that separates man from insects is not wider than that which severs
the polluted from the chaste among women yesterday and to-day i am the
same there is a degree of depravity to which it is impossible for me
to sink yet in the apprehension of another my ancient and intimate
associate the perpetual witness of my actions and partaker of my
thoughts i had ceased to be the same my integrity was tarnished
and withered in his eyes i was the colleague of a murderer and the
paramour of a thief

his opinion was not destitute of evidence yet what proofs could
reasonably avail to establish an opinion like this if the sentiments
corresponded not with the voice that was heard the evidence was
deficient but this want of correspondence would have been supposed by
me if i had been the auditor and pleyel the criminal but mimicry might
still more plausibly have been employed to explain the scene alas it
is the fate of clara wieland to fall into the hands of a precipitate and
inexorable judge

but what o man of mischief is the tendency of thy thoughts frustrated
in thy first design thou wilt not forego the immolation of thy victim
to exterminate my reputation was all that remained to thee and this my
guardian has permitted to dispossess pleyel of this prejudice may be
impossible but if that be effected it cannot be supposed that thy
wiles are exhausted thy cunning will discover innumerable avenues to
the accomplishment of thy malignant purpose

why should i enter the lists against thee would to heaven i could
disarm thy vengeance by my deprecations when i think of all the
resources with which nature and education have supplied thee that thy
form is a combination of steely fibres and organs of exquisite ductility
and boundless compass actuated by an intelligence gifted with infinite
endowments and comprehending all knowledge i perceive that my doom
is fixed what obstacle will be able to divert thy zeal or repel thy
efforts that being who has hitherto protected me has borne testimony to
the formidableness of thy attempts since nothing less than supernatural
interference could check thy career

musing on these thoughts i arrived towards the close of the day at
pleyel's house a month before i had traversed the same path but how
different were my sensations now i was seeking the presence of one who
regarded me as the most degenerate of human kind i was to plead the
cause of my innocence against witnesses the most explicit and unerring
of those which support the fabric of human knowledge the nearer i
approached the crisis the more did my confidence decay when the chaise
stopped at the door my strength refused to support me and i threw
myself into the arms of an ancient female domestic i had not courage to
inquire whether her master was at home i was tormented with fears that
the projected journey was already undertaken these fears were removed
by her asking me whether she should call her young master who had just
gone into his own room i was somewhat revived by this intelligence and
resolved immediately to seek him there

in my confusion of mind i neglected to knock at the door but entered
his apartment without previous notice this abruptness was altogether
involuntary absorbed in reflections of such unspeakable moment i had
no leisure to heed the niceties of punctilio i discovered him standing
with his back towards the entrance a small trunk with its lid raised
was before him in which it seemed as if he had been busy in packing
his clothes the moment of my entrance he was employed in gazing at
something which he held in his hand

i imagined that i fully comprehended this scene the image which he held
before him and by which his attention was so deeply engaged i doubted
not to be my own these preparations for his journey the cause to which
it was to be imputed the hopelessness of success in the undertaking on
which i had entered rushed at once upon my feelings and dissolved me
into a flood of tears

startled by this sound he dropped the lid of the trunk and turned the
solemn sadness that previously overspread his countenance gave
sudden way to an attitude and look of the most vehement astonishment
perceiving me unable to uphold myself he stepped towards me without
speaking and supported me by his arm the kindness of this action
called forth a new effusion from my eyes weeping was a solace to
which at that time i had not grown familiar and which therefore
was peculiarly delicious indignation was no longer to be read in the
features of my friend they were pregnant with a mixture of wonder and
pity their expression was easily interpreted this visit and these
tears were tokens of my penitence the wretch whom he had stigmatized
as incurably and obdurately wicked now shewed herself susceptible of
remorse and had come to confess her guilt

this persuasion had no tendency to comfort me it only shewed me with
new evidence the difficulty of the task which i had assigned myself we
were mutually silent i had less power and less inclination than ever to
speak i extricated myself from his hold and threw myself on a sofa
he placed himself by my side and appeared to wait with impatience and
anxiety for some beginning of the conversation what could i say if my
mind had suggested any thing suitable to the occasion my utterance was
suffocated by tears

frequently he attempted to speak but seemed deterred by some degree of
uncertainty as to the true nature of the scene at length in faltering
accents he spoke

my friend would to heaven i were still permitted to call you by that
name the image that i once adored existed only in my fancy but though
i cannot hope to see it realized you may not be totally insensible to
the horrors of that gulf into which you are about to plunge what heart
is forever exempt from the goadings of compunction and the influx of
laudable propensities

i thought you accomplished and wise beyond the rest of women not a
sentiment you uttered not a look you assumed that were not in
my apprehension fraught with the sublimities of rectitude and the
illuminations of genius deceit has some bounds your education could
not be without influence a vigorous understanding cannot be utterly
devoid of virtue but you could not counterfeit the powers of invention
and reasoning i was rash in my invectives i will not but with life
relinquish all hopes of you i will shut out every proof that would tell
me that your heart is incurably diseased

you come to restore me once more to happiness to convince me that you
have torn her mask from vice and feel nothing but abhorrence for the
part you have hitherto acted

at these words my equanimity forsook me for a moment i forgot the
evidence from which pleyel's opinions were derived the benevolence of
his remonstrances and the grief which his accents bespoke i was filled
with indignation and horror at charges so black i shrunk back and
darted at him a look of disdain and anger my passion supplied me with
words

what detestable infatuation was it that led me hither why do i
patiently endure these horrible insults my offences exist only in
your own distempered imagination you are leagued with the traitor who
assailed my life you have vowed the destruction of my peace and honor
i deserve infamy for listening to calumnies so base

these words were heard by pleyel without visible resentment his
countenance relapsed into its former gloom but he did not even look at
me the ideas which had given place to my angry emotions returned and
once more melted me into tears o i exclaimed in a voice broken by
sobs what a task is mine compelled to hearken to charges which i feel
to be false but which i know to be believed by him that utters them
believed too not without evidence which though fallacious is not
unplausible

i came hither not to confess but to vindicate i know the source
of your opinions wieland has informed me on what your suspicions are
built these suspicions are fostered by you as certainties the tenor
of my life of all my conversations and letters affords me no security
every sentiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered bear testimony
to the rectitude of my mind but this testimony is rejected i am
condemned as brutally profligate i am classed with the stupidly and
sordidly wicked

and where are the proofs that must justify so foul and so improbable
an accusation you have overheard a midnight conference voices have
saluted your ear in which you imagine yourself to have recognized
mine and that of a detected villain the sentiments expressed were
not allowed to outweigh the casual or concerted resemblance of voice
sentiments the reverse of all those whose influence my former life had
attested denoting a mind polluted by grovelling vices and entering
into compact with that of a thief and a murderer the nature of these
sentiments did not enable you to detect the cheat did not suggest to
you the possibility that my voice had been counterfeited by another

you were precipitate and prone to condemn instead of rushing on the
impostors and comparing the evidence of sight with that of hearing you
stood aloof or you fled my innocence would not now have stood in
need of vindication if this conduct had been pursued that you did not
pursue it your present thoughts incontestibly prove yet this conduct
might surely have been expected from pleyel that he would not hastily
impute the blackest of crimes that he would not couple my name with
infamy and cover me with ruin for inadequate or slight reasons might
reasonably have been expected the sobs which convulsed my bosom would
not suffer me to proceed

pleyel was for a moment affected he looked at me with some expression
of doubt but this quickly gave place to a mournful solemnity he fixed
his eyes on the floor as in reverie and spoke

two hours hence i am gone shall i carry away with me the sorrow that
is now my guest or shall that sorrow be accumulated tenfold what is
she that is now before me shall every hour supply me with new proofs of
a wickedness beyond example already i deem her the most abandoned and
detestable of human creatures her coming and her tears imparted a gleam
of hope but that gleam has vanished

he now fixed his eyes upon me and every muscle in his face trembled
his tone was hollow and terrible thou knowest that i was a witness of
your interview yet thou comest hither to upbraid me for injustice thou
canst look me in the face and say that i am deceived an inscrutable
providence has fashioned thee for some end thou wilt live no doubt to
fulfil the purposes of thy maker if he repent not of his workmanship
and send not his vengeance to exterminate thee ere the measure of thy
days be full surely nothing in the shape of man can vie with thee

but i thought i had stifled this fury i am not constituted thy judge
my office is to pity and amend and not to punish and revile i deemed
myself exempt from all tempestuous passions i had almost persuaded
myself to weep over thy fall but i am frail as dust and mutable as
water i am calm i am compassionate only in thy absence make this
house this room thy abode as long as thou wilt but forgive me if i
prefer solitude for the short time during which i shall stay saying
this he motioned as if to leave the apartment

the stormy passions of this man affected me by sympathy i ceased to
weep i was motionless and speechless with agony i sat with my hands
clasped mutely gazing after him as he withdrew i desired to detain
him but was unable to make any effort for that purpose till he had
passed out of the room i then uttered an involuntary and piercing
cry pleyel art thou gone gone forever

at this summons he hastily returned he beheld me wild pale gasping
for breath and my head already sinking on my bosom a painful dizziness
seized me and i fainted away

when i recovered i found myself stretched on a bed in the outer
apartment and pleyel with two female servants standing beside it all
the fury and scorn which the countenance of the former lately expressed
had now disappeared and was succeeded by the most tender anxiety as
soon as he perceived that my senses were returned to me he clasped his
hands and exclaimed god be thanked you are once more alive i had
almost despaired of your recovery i fear i have been precipitate and
unjust my senses must have been the victims of some inexplicable and
momentary phrenzy forgive me i beseech you forgive my reproaches i
would purchase conviction of your purity at the price of my existence
here and hereafter

he once more in a tone of the most fervent tenderness besought me to
be composed and then left me to the care of the women



chapter xiii


here was wrought a surprizing change in my friend what was it that
had shaken conviction so firm had any thing occurred during my fit
adequate to produce so total an alteration my attendants informed me
that he had not left my apartment that the unusual duration of my fit
and the failure for a time of all the means used for my recovery had
filled him with grief and dismay did he regard the effect which his
reproaches had produced as a proof of my sincerity

in this state of mind i little regarded my languors of body i rose
and requested an interview with him before my departure on which i was
resolved notwithstanding his earnest solicitation to spend the night
at his house he complied with my request the tenderness which he had
lately betrayed had now disappeared and he once more relapsed into a
chilling solemnity

i told him that i was preparing to return to my brother's that i had
come hither to vindicate my innocence from the foul aspersions which he
had cast upon it my pride had not taken refuge in silence or distance
i had not relied upon time or the suggestion of his cooler thoughts to
confute his charges conscious as i was that i was perfectly guiltless
and entertaining some value for his good opinion i could not prevail
upon myself to believe that my efforts to make my innocence manifest
would be fruitless adverse appearances might be numerous and specious
but they were unquestionably false i was willing to believe him
sincere that he made no charges which he himself did not believe but
these charges were destitute of truth the grounds of his opinion were
fallacious and i desired an opportunity of detecting their fallacy
i entreated him to be explicit and to give me a detail of what he had
heard and what he had seen

at these words my companion's countenance grew darker he appeared
to be struggling with his rage he opened his lips to speak but his
accents died away ere they were formed this conflict lasted for some
minutes but his fortitude was finally successful he spoke as follows

i would fain put an end to this hateful scene what i shall say will
be breath idly and unprofitably consumed the clearest narrative will
add nothing to your present knowledge you are acquainted with the
grounds of my opinion and yet you avow yourself innocent why then
should i rehearse these grounds you are apprized of the character of
carwin why then should i enumerate the discoveries which i have made
respecting him yet since it is your request since considering the
limitedness of human faculties some error may possibly lurk in those
appearances which i have witnessed i will briefly relate what i know

need i dwell upon the impressions which your conversation and
deportment originally made upon me we parted in childhood but our
intercourse by letter was copious and uninterrupted how fondly did i
anticipate a meeting with one whom her letters had previously taught
me to consider as the first of women and how fully realized were the
expectations that i had formed

here said i is a being after whom sages may model their transcendent
intelligence and painters their ideal beauty here is exemplified
that union between intellect and form which has hitherto existed only
in the conceptions of the poet i have watched your eyes my attention
has hung upon your lips i have questioned whether the enchantments of
your voice were more conspicuous in the intricacies of melody or the
emphasis of rhetoric i have marked the transitions of your discourse
the felicities of your expression your refined argumentation and
glowing imagery and been forced to acknowledge that all delights were
meagre and contemptible compared with those connected with the
audience and sight of you i have contemplated your principles and been
astonished at the solidity of their foundation and the perfection of
their structure i have traced you to your home i have viewed you in
relation to your servants to your family to your neighbours and to
the world i have seen by what skilful arrangements you facilitate
the performance of the most arduous and complicated duties what daily
accessions of strength your judicious discipline bestowed upon
your memory what correctness and abundance of knowledge was daily
experienced by your unwearied application to books and to writing
if she that possesses so much in the bloom of youth will go on
accumulating her stores what said i is the picture she will display
at a mature age

you know not the accuracy of my observation i was desirous that others
should profit by an example so rare i therefore noted down in writing
every particular of your conduct i was anxious to benefit by an
opportunity so seldom afforded us i laboured not to omit the slightest
shade or the most petty line in your portrait here there was no other
task incumbent on me but to copy there was no need to exaggerate or
overlook in order to produce a more unexceptionable pattern here was
a combination of harmonies and graces incapable of diminution or
accession without injury to its completeness

i found no end and no bounds to my task no display of a scene like
this could be chargeable with redundancy or superfluity even the colour
of a shoe the knot of a ribband or your attitude in plucking a
rose were of moment to be recorded even the arrangements of your
breakfast-table and your toilet have been amply displayed

i know that mankind are more easily enticed to virtue by example than
by precept i know that the absoluteness of a model when supplied by
invention diminishes its salutary influence since it is useless we
think to strive after that which we know to be beyond our reach but
the picture which i drew was not a phantom as a model it was devoid
of imperfection and to aspire to that height which had been really
attained was by no means unreasonable i had another and more
interesting object in view one existed who claimed all my tenderness
here in all its parts was a model worthy of assiduous study and
indefatigable imitation i called upon her as she wished to secure and
enhance my esteem to mould her thoughts her words her countenance
her actions by this pattern

the task was exuberant of pleasure and i was deeply engaged in it
when an imp of mischief was let loose in the form of carwin i admired
his powers and accomplishments i did not wonder that they were admired
by you on the rectitude of your judgement however i relied to keep
this admiration within discreet and scrupulous bounds i assured myself
that the strangeness of his deportment and the obscurity of his life
would teach you caution of all errors my knowledge of your character
informed me that this was least likely to befall you

you were powerfully affected by his first appearance you were
bewitched by his countenance and his tones your description was ardent
and pathetic i listened to you with some emotions of surprize the
portrait you drew in his absence and the intensity with which you mused
upon it were new and unexpected incidents they bespoke a sensibility
somewhat too vivid but from which while subjected to the guidance of
an understanding like yours there was nothing to dread

a more direct intercourse took place between you i need not apologize
for the solicitude which i entertained for your safety he that gifted
me with perception of excellence compelled me to love it in the midst
of danger and pain my contemplations have ever been cheered by your
image every object in competition with you was worthless and trivial
no price was too great by which your safety could be purchased for
that end the sacrifice of ease of health and even of life would
cheerfully have been made by me what wonder then that i scrutinized
the sentiments and deportment of this man with ceaseless vigilance
that i watched your words and your looks when he was present and that i
extracted cause for the deepest inquietudes from every token which you
gave of having put your happiness into this man's keeping

i was cautious in deciding i recalled the various conversations in
which the topics of love and marriage had been discussed as a woman
young beautiful and independent it behoved you to have fortified
your mind with just principles on this subject your principles were
eminently just had not their rectitude and their firmness been attested
by your treatment of that specious seducer dashwood these principles
i was prone to believe exempted you from danger in this new state of
things i was not the last to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity
insinuation and eloquence of this man i have disguised but could
never stifle the conviction that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft
in them which rendered him truly formidable but i reflected on the
ambiguous expression of his countenance an ambiguity which you were the
first to remark on the cloud which obscured his character and on the
suspicious nature of that concealment which he studied and concluded
you to be safe i denied the obvious construction to appearances i
referred your conduct to some principle which had not been hitherto
disclosed but which was reconcileable with those already known

i was not suffered to remain long in this suspence one evening you
may recollect i came to your house where it was my purpose as usual
to lodge somewhat earlier than ordinary i spied a light in your
chamber as i approached from the outside and on inquiring of judith
was informed that you were writing as your kinsman and friend and
fellow-lodger i thought i had a right to be familiar you were in your
chamber but your employment and the time were such as to make it no
infraction of decorum to follow you thither the spirit of mischievous
gaiety possessed me i proceeded on tiptoe you did not perceive
my entrance and i advanced softly till i was able to overlook your
shoulder

i had gone thus far in error and had no power to recede how
cautiously should we guard against the first inroads of temptation i
knew that to pry into your papers was criminal but i reflected that
no sentiment of yours was of a nature which made it your interest to
conceal it you wrote much more than you permitted your friends to
peruse my curiosity was strong and i had only to throw a glance upon
the paper to secure its gratification i should never have deliberately
committed an act like this the slightest obstacle would have repelled
me but my eye glanced almost spontaneously upon the paper i caught
only parts of sentences but my eyes comprehended more at a glance
because the characters were short-hand i lighted on the words
summer-house midnight and made out a passage which spoke of the
propriety and of the effects to be expected from another interview
all this passed in less than a moment i then checked myself and made
myself known to you by a tap upon your shoulder

i could pardon and account for some trifling alarm but your
trepidation and blushes were excessive you hurried the paper out of
sight and seemed too anxious to discover whether i knew the contents to
allow yourself to make any inquiries i wondered at these appearances
of consternation but did not reason on them until i had retired when
alone these incidents suggested themselves to my reflections anew

to what scene or what interview i asked did you allude your
disappearance on a former evening my tracing you to the recess in the
bank your silence on my first and second call your vague answers and
invincible embarrassment when you at length ascended the hill i
recollected with new surprize could this be the summerhouse alluded to
a certain timidity and consciousness had generally attended you when
this incident and this recess had been the subjects of conversation
nay i imagined that the last time that adventure was mentioned which
happened in the presence of carwin the countenance of the latter
betrayed some emotion could the interview have been with him

this was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty to contemplation
an interview at that hour in this darksome retreat with a man of this
mysterious but formidable character a clandestine interview and one
which you afterwards endeavoured with so much solicitude to conceal it
was a fearful and portentous occurrence i could not measure his power
or fathom his designs had he rifled from you the secret of your love
and reconciled you to concealment and noctural meetings i scarcely ever
spent a night of more inquietude

i knew not how to act the ascertainment of this man's character
and views seemed to be in the first place necessary had he openly
preferred his suit to you we should have been impowered to make
direct inquiries but since he had chosen this obscure path it seemed
reasonable to infer that his character was exceptionable it at
least subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other means of
information yet the improbability that you should commit a deed of such
rashness made me reflect anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds
on which my suspicions had been built and almost to condemn myself for
harbouring them

though it was mere conjecture that the interview spoken of had taken
place with carwin yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the most
painful doubts this man's reasonings might be so specious and
his artifices so profound that aided by the passion which you had
conceived for him he had finally succeeded or his situation might be
such as to justify the secrecy which you maintained in neither case did
my wildest reveries suggest to me that your honor had been forfeited

i could not talk with you on this subject if the imputation was false
its atrociousness would have justly drawn upon me your resentment and
i must have explained by what facts it had been suggested if it were
true no benefit would follow from the mention of it you had chosen
to conceal it for some reasons and whether these reasons were true or
false it was proper to discover and remove them in the first place
finally i acquiesced in the least painful supposition trammelled as it
was with perplexities that carwin was upright and that if the reasons
of your silence were known they would be found to be just



chapter xiv


three days have elapsed since this occurrence i have been haunted by
perpetual inquietude to bring myself to regard carwin without terror
and to acquiesce in the belief of your safety was impossible yet to
put an end to my doubts seemed to be impracticable if some light could
be reflected on the actual situation of this man a direct path would
present itself if he were contrary to the tenor of his conversation
cunning and malignant to apprize you of this would be to place you in
security if he were merely unfortunate and innocent most readily would
i espouse his cause and if his intentions were upright with regard to
you most eagerly would i sanctify your choice by my approbation

it would be vain to call upon carwin for an avowal of his deeds it was
better to know nothing than to be deceived by an artful tale what he
was unwilling to communicate and this unwillingness had been repeatedly
manifested could never be extorted from him importunity might be
appeased or imposture effected by fallacious representations to the
rest of the world he was unknown i had often made him the subject of
discourse but a glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of
their knowledge who knew most none had ever seen him before and
received as new the information which my intercourse with him in
valencia and my present intercourse enabled me to give

wieland was your brother if he had really made you the object of his
courtship was not a brother authorized to interfere and demand from him
the confession of his views yet what were the grounds on which i had
reared this supposition would they justify a measure like this surely
not

in the course of my restless meditations it occurred to me at length
that my duty required me to speak to you to confess the indecorum of
which i had been guilty and to state the reflections to which it had
led me i was prompted by no mean or selfish views the heart within my
breast was not more precious than your safety most cheerfully would
i have interposed my life between you and danger would you cherish
resentment at my conduct when acquainted with the motive which
produced it it would not only exempt me from censure but entitle me to
gratitude

yesterday had been selected for the rehearsal of the newly-imported
tragedy i promised to be present the state of my thoughts but little
qualified me for a performer or auditor in such a scene but i reflected
that after it was finished i should return home with you and should
then enjoy an opportunity of discoursing with you fully on this topic
my resolution was not formed without a remnant of doubt as to its
propriety when i left this house to perform the visit i had promised
my mind was full of apprehension and despondency the dubiousness of
the event of our conversation fear that my interference was too late to
secure your peace and the uncertainty to which hope gave birth whether
i had not erred in believing you devoted to this man or at least in
imagining that he had obtained your consent to midnight conferences
distracted me with contradictory opinions and repugnant emotions

i can assign no reason for calling at mrs baynton's i had seen her
in the morning and knew her to be well the concerted hour had nearly
arrived and yet i turned up the street which leads to her house and
dismounted at her door i entered the parlour and threw myself in a
chair i saw and inquired for no one my whole frame was overpowered
by dreary and comfortless sensations one idea possessed me wholly
the inexpressible importance of unveiling the designs and character of
carwin and the utter improbability that this ever would be effected
some instinct induced me to lay my hand upon a newspaper i had perused
all the general intelligence it contained in the morning and at the
same spot the act was rather mechanical than voluntary

i threw a languid glance at the first column that presented itself
the first words which i read began with the offer of a reward of three
hundred guineas for the apprehension of a convict under sentence of
death who had escaped from newgate prison in dublin good heaven how
every fibre of my frame tingled when i proceeded to read that the name
of the criminal was francis carwin

the descriptions of his person and address were minute his stature
hair complexion the extraordinary position and arrangement of his
features his aukward and disproportionate form his gesture and gait
corresponded perfectly with those of our mysterious visitant he had
been found guilty in two indictments one for the murder of the lady
jane conway and the other for a robbery committed on the person of the
honorable mr ludloe

i repeatedly perused this passage the ideas which flowed in upon my
mind affected me like an instant transition from death to life the
purpose dearest to my heart was thus effected at a time and by means
the least of all others within the scope of my foresight but what
purpose carwin was detected acts of the blackest and most sordid
guilt had been committed by him here was evidence which imparted to
my understanding the most luminous certainty the name visage and
deportment were the same between the time of his escape and his
appearance among us there was a sufficient agreement such was the
man with whom i suspected you to maintain a clandestine correspondence
should i not haste to snatch you from the talons of this vulture should
i see you rushing to the verge of a dizzy precipice and not stretch
forth a hand to pull you back i had no need to deliberate i thrust the
paper in my pocket and resolved to obtain an immediate conference with
you for a time no other image made its way to my understanding at
length it occurred to me that though the information i possessed
was in one sense sufficient yet if more could be obtained more was
desirable this passage was copied from a british paper part of it
only perhaps was transcribed the printer was in possession of the
original

towards his house i immediately turned my horse's head he produced the
paper but i found nothing more than had already been seen while busy
in perusing it the printer stood by my side he noticed the object
of which i was in search aye said he that is a strange affair i
should never have met with it had not mr hallet sent to me the paper
with a particular request to republish that advertisement

mr hallet what reasons could he have for making this request had
the paper sent to him been accompanied by any information respecting
the convict had he personal or extraordinary reasons for desiring its
republication this was to be known only in one way i speeded to
his house in answer to my interrogations he told me that ludloe had
formerly been in america and that during his residence in this
city considerable intercourse had taken place between them hence a
confidence arose which has since been kept alive by occasional letters
he had lately received a letter from him enclosing the newspaper from
which this extract had been made he put it into my hands and pointed
out the passages which related to carwin

ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and escape and adds that
he had reason to believe him to have embarked for america he describes
him in general terms as the most incomprehensible and formidable among
men as engaged in schemes reasonably suspected to be in the highest
degree criminal but such as no human intelligence is able to unravel
that his ends are pursued by means which leave it in doubt whether he be
not in league with some infernal spirit that his crimes have hitherto
been perpetrated with the aid of some unknown but desperate accomplices
that he wages a perpetual war against the happiness of mankind and sets
his engines of destruction at work against every object that presents
itself

this is the substance of the letter hallet expressed some surprize
at the curiosity which was manifested by me on this occasion i was too
much absorbed by the ideas suggested by this letter to pay attention to
his remarks i shuddered with the apprehension of the evil to which our
indiscreet familiarity with this man had probably exposed us i burnt
with impatience to see you and to do what in me lay to avert the
calamity which threatened us it was already five o'clock night was
hastening and there was no time to be lost on leaving mr hallet's
house who should meet me in the street but bertrand the servant whom
i left in germany his appearance and accoutrements bespoke him to have
just alighted from a toilsome and long journey i was not wholly without
expectation of seeing him about this time but no one was then more
distant from my thoughts you know what reasons i have for anxiety
respecting scenes with which this man was conversant carwin was for a
moment forgotten in answer to my vehement inquiries bertrand produced
a copious packet i shall not at present mention its contents nor the
measures which they obliged me to adopt i bestowed a brief perusal on
these papers and having given some directions to bertrand resumed
my purpose with regard to you my horse i was obliged to resign to my
servant he being charged with a commission that required speed the
clock had struck ten and mettingen was five miles distant i was
to journey thither on foot these circumstances only added to my
expedition

as i passed swiftly along i reviewed all the incidents accompanying
the appearance and deportment of that man among us late events have
been inexplicable and mysterious beyond any of which i have either read
or heard these events were coeval with carwin's introduction i am
unable to explain their origin and mutual dependance but i do not on
that account believe them to have a supernatural origin is not this
man the agent some of them seem to be propitious but what should
i think of those threats of assassination with which you were lately
alarmed bloodshed is the trade and horror is the element of this man
the process by which the sympathies of nature are extinguished in
our hearts by which evil is made our good and by which we are made
susceptible of no activity but in the infliction and no joy but in the
spectacle of woes is an obvious process as to an alliance with evil
geniuses the power and the malice of daemons have been a thousand times
exemplified in human beings there are no devils but those which are
begotten upon selfishness and reared by cunning

now indeed the scene was changed it was not his secret poniard
that i dreaded it was only the success of his efforts to make you a
confederate in your own destruction to make your will the instrument by
which he might bereave you of liberty and honor

i took as usual the path through your brother's ground i ranged
with celerity and silence along the bank i approached the fence which
divides wieland's estate from yours the recess in the bank being near
this line it being necessary for me to pass near it my mind being
tainted with inveterate suspicions concerning you suspicions which were
indebted for their strength to incidents connected with this spot what
wonder that it seized upon my thoughts i leaped on the fence but
before i descended on the opposite side i paused to survey the scene
leaves dropping with dew and glistening in the moon's rays with no
moving object to molest the deep repose filled me with security
and hope i left the station at length and tended forward you were
probably at rest how should i communicate without alarming you the
intelligence of my arrival an immediate interview was to be procured
i could not bear to think that a minute should be lost by remissness
or hesitation should i knock at the door or should i stand under your
chamber windows which i perceived to be open and awaken you by my
calls

these reflections employed me as i passed opposite to the
summer-house i had scarcely gone by when my ear caught a sound unusual
at this time and place it was almost too faint and too transient to
allow me a distinct perception of it i stopped to listen presently
it was heard again and now it was somewhat in a louder key it was
laughter and unquestionably produced by a female voice that voice was
familiar to my senses it was yours

whence it came i was at first at a loss to conjecture but this
uncertainty vanished when it was heard the third time i threw back my
eyes towards the recess every other organ and limb was useless to me
i did not reason on the subject i did not in a direct manner draw
my conclusions from the hour the place the hilarity which this sound
betokened and the circumstance of having a companion which it no less
incontestably proved in an instant as it were my heart was invaded
with cold and the pulses of life at a stand

why should i go further why should i return should i not hurry to a
distance from a sound which though formerly so sweet and delectable
was now more hideous than the shrieks of owls

i had no time to yield to this impulse the thought of approaching and
listening occurred to me i had no doubt of which i was conscious yet
my certainty was capable of increase i was likewise stimulated by a
sentiment that partook of rage i was governed by an half-formed and
tempestuous resolution to break in upon your interview and strike you
dead with my upbraiding

i approached with the utmost caution when i reached the edge of the
bank immediately above the summer-house i thought i heard voices from
below as busy in conversation the steps in the rock are clear of
bushy impediments they allowed me to descend into a cavity beside
the building without being detected thus to lie in wait could only be
justified by the momentousness of the occasion

here pleyel paused in his narrative and fixed his eyes upon me
situated as i was my horror and astonishment at this tale gave way to
compassion for the anguish which the countenance of my friend betrayed
i reflected on his force of understanding i reflected on the powers of
my enemy i could easily divine the substance of the conversation that
was overheard carwin had constructed his plot in a manner suited to the
characters of those whom he had selected for his victims i saw that the
convictions of pleyel were immutable i forbore to struggle against the
storm because i saw that all struggles would be fruitless i was calm
but my calmness was the torpor of despair and not the tranquillity of
fortitude it was calmness invincible by any thing that his grief and
his fury could suggest to pleyel he resumed 

woman wilt thou hear me further shall i go on to repeat the
conversation is it shame that makes thee tongue-tied shall i go on or
art thou satisfied with what has been already said

i bowed my head go on said i i make not this request in the hope
of undeceiving you i shall no longer contend with my own weakness the
storm is let loose and i shall peaceably submit to be driven by its
fury but go on this conference will end only with affording me a
clearer foresight of my destiny but that will be some satisfaction and
i will not part without it

why on hearing these words did pleyel hesitate did some unlooked-for
doubt insinuate itself into his mind was his belief suddenly shaken
by my looks or my words or by some newly recollected circumstance
whencesoever it arose it could not endure the test of deliberation in
a few minutes the flame of resentment was again lighted up in his bosom
he proceeded with his accustomed vehemence 

i hate myself for this folly i can find no apology for this tale yet
i am irresistibly impelled to relate it she that hears me is apprized
of every particular i have only to repeat to her her own words she
will listen with a tranquil air and the spectacle of her obduracy will
drive me to some desperate act why then should i persist yet persist i
must

again he paused no said he it is impossible to repeat your avowals
of love your appeals to former confessions of your tenderness to
former deeds of dishonor to the circumstances of the first interview
that took place between you it was on that night when i traced you to
this recess thither had he enticed you and there had you ratified an
unhallowed compact by admitting him 

great god thou witnessedst the agonies that tore my bosom at that
moment thou witnessedst my efforts to repel the testimony of my ears
it was in vain that you dwelt upon the confusion which my unlooked-for
summons excited in you the tardiness with which a suitable excuse
occurred to you your resentment that my impertinent intrusion had
put an end to that charming interview a disappointment for which you
endeavoured to compensate yourself by the frequency and duration of
subsequent meetings

in vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only could be conscious
incidents that occurred on occasions on which none beside your own
family were witnesses in vain was your discourse characterized by
peculiarities inimitable of sentiment and language my conviction was
effected only by an accumulation of the same tokens i yielded not but
to evidence which took away the power to withhold my faith

my sight was of no use to me beneath so thick an umbrage the darkness
was intense hearing was the only avenue to information which the
circumstances allowed to be open i was couched within three feet
of you why should i approach nearer i could not contend with your
betrayer what could be the purpose of a contest you stood in no need
of a protector what could i do but retire from the spot overwhelmed
with confusion and dismay i sought my chamber and endeavoured to
regain my composure the door of the house which i found open your
subsequent entrance closing and fastening it and going into your
chamber which had been thus long deserted were only confirmations of
the truth

why should i paint the tempestuous fluctuation of my thoughts between
grief and revenge between rage and despair why should i repeat my vows
of eternal implacability and persecution and the speedy recantation of
these vows

i have said enough you have dismissed me from a place in your esteem
what i think and what i feel is of no importance in your eyes may
the duty which i owe myself enable me to forget your existence in a
few minutes i go hence be the maker of your fortune and may adversity
instruct you in that wisdom which education was unable to impart to
you

those were the last words which pleyel uttered he left the room and
my new emotions enabled me to witness his departure without any apparent
loss of composure as i sat alone i ruminated on these incidents
nothing was more evident than that i had taken an eternal leave of
happiness life was a worthless thing separate from that good which had
now been wrested from me yet the sentiment that now possessed me had no
tendency to palsy my exertions and overbear my strength i noticed that
the light was declining and perceived the propriety of leaving this
house i placed myself again in the chaise and returned slowly towards
the city



chapter xv


before i reached the city it was dusk it was my purpose to spend the
night at mettingen i was not solicitous as long as i was attended by
a faithful servant to be there at an early hour my exhausted strength
required me to take some refreshment with this view and in order to
pay respect to one whose affection for me was truly maternal i stopped
at mrs baynton's she was absent from home but i had scarcely entered
the house when one of her domestics presented me a letter i opened and
read as follows


to clara wieland

what shall i say to extenuate the misconduct of last night it is my
duty to repair it to the utmost of my power but the only way in which
it can be repaired you will not i fear be prevailed on to adopt it
is by granting me an interview at your own house at eleven o'clock
this night i have no means of removing any fears that you may entertain
of my designs but my simple and solemn declarations these after what
has passed between us you may deem unworthy of confidence i cannot
help it my folly and rashness has left me no other resource i will
be at your door by that hour if you chuse to admit me to a conference
provided that conference has no witnesses i will disclose to you
particulars the knowledge of which is of the utmost importance to your
happiness farewell

carwin


what a letter was this a man known to be an assassin and robber one
capable of plotting against my life and my fame detected lurking in
my chamber and avowing designs the most flagitious and dreadful now
solicits me to grant him a midnight interview to admit him alone into
my presence could he make this request with the expectation of my
compliance what had he seen in me that could justify him in admitting
so wild a belief yet this request is preferred with the utmost gravity
it is not accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earnestness had
the misconduct to which he alludes been a slight incivility and the
interview requested to take place in the midst of my friends there
would have been no extravagance in the tenor of this letter but as it
was the writer had surely been bereft of his reason

i perused this epistle frequently the request it contained might be
called audacious or stupid if it had been made by a different person
but from carwin who could not be unaware of the effect which it must
naturally produce and of the manner in which it would unavoidably be
treated it was perfectly inexplicable he must have counted on the
success of some plot in order to extort my assent none of those
motives by which i am usually governed would ever have persuaded me to
meet any one of his sex at the time and place which he had prescribed
much less would i consent to a meeting with a man tainted with the
most detestable crimes and by whose arts my own safety had been so
imminently endangered and my happiness irretrievably destroyed i
shuddered at the idea that such a meeting was possible i felt some
reluctance to approach a spot which he still visited and haunted

such were the ideas which first suggested themselves on the perusal of
the letter meanwhile i resumed my journey my thoughts still dwelt
upon the same topic gradually from ruminating on this epistle i
reverted to my interview with pleyel i recalled the particulars of the
dialogue to which he had been an auditor my heart sunk anew on viewing
the inextricable complexity of this deception and the inauspicious
concurrence of events which tended to confirm him in his error when
he approached my chamber door my terror kept me mute he put his ear
perhaps to the crevice but it caught the sound of nothing human had
i called or made any token that denoted some one to be within words
would have ensued and as omnipresence was impossible this discovery
and the artless narrative of what had just passed would have saved me
from his murderous invectives he went into his chamber and after some
interval i stole across the entry and down the stairs with
inaudible steps having secured the outer doors i returned with less
circumspection he heard me not when i descended but my returning steps
were easily distinguished now he thought was the guilty interview at
an end in what other way was it possible for him to construe these
signals

how fallacious and precipitate was my decision carwin's plot owed its
success to a coincidence of events scarcely credible the balance was
swayed from its equipoise by a hair had i even begun the conversation
with an account of what befel me in my chamber my previous interview
with wieland would have taught him to suspect me of imposture yet if
i were discoursing with this ruffian when pleyel touched the lock of my
chamber door and when he shut his own door with so much violence how
he might ask should i be able to relate these incidents perhaps he
had withheld the knowledge of these circumstances from my brother from
whom therefore i could not obtain it so that my innocence would have
thus been irresistibly demonstrated

the first impulse which flowed from these ideas was to return upon my
steps and demand once more an interview but he was gone his parting
declarations were remembered

pleyel i exclaimed thou art gone for ever are thy mistakes beyond
the reach of detection am i helpless in the midst of this snare
the plotter is at hand he even speaks in the style of penitence he
solicits an interview which he promises shall end in the disclosure of
something momentous to my happiness what can he say which will avail to
turn aside this evil but why should his remorse be feigned i have
done him no injury his wickedness is fertile only of despair and the
billows of remorse will some time overbear him why may not this event
have already taken place why should i refuse to see him

this idea was present as it were for a moment i suddenly recoiled
from it confounded at that frenzy which could give even momentary
harbour to such a scheme yet presently it returned at length i even
conceived it to deserve deliberation i questioned whether it was
not proper to admit at a lonely spot in a sacred hour this man of
tremendous and inscrutable attributes this performer of horrid deeds
and whose presence was predicted to call down unheard-of and unutterable
horrors

what was it that swayed me i felt myself divested of the power to will
contrary to the motives that determined me to seek his presence my mind
seemed to be split into separate parts and these parts to have
entered into furious and implacable contention these tumults gradually
subsided the reasons why i should confide in that interposition which
had hitherto defended me in those tokens of compunction which this
letter contained in the efficacy of this interview to restore its
spotlessness to my character and banish all illusions from the mind of
my friend continually acquired new evidence and new strength

what should i fear in his presence this was unlike an artifice intended
to betray me into his hands if it were an artifice what purpose would
it serve the freedom of my mind was untouched and that freedom would
defy the assaults of blandishments or magic force was i not able to
repel on the former occasion my courage it is true had failed at the
imminent approach of danger but then i had not enjoyed opportunities of
deliberation i had foreseen nothing i was sunk into imbecility by my
previous thoughts i had been the victim of recent disappointments
and anticipated ills witness my infatuation in opening the closet in
opposition to divine injunctions

now perhaps my courage was the offspring of a no less erring
principle pleyel was for ever lost to me i strove in vain to assume
his person and suppress my resentment i strove in vain to believe in
the assuaging influence of time to look forward to the birth-day of new
hopes and the re-exaltation of that luminary of whose effulgencies i
had so long and so liberally partaken

what had i to suffer worse than was already inflicted

was not carwin my foe i owed my untimely fate to his treason instead
of flying from his presence ought i not to devote all my faculties to
the gaining of an interview and compel him to repair the ills of
which he has been the author why should i suppose him impregnable
to argument have i not reason on my side and the power of imparting
conviction cannot he be made to see the justice of unravelling the maze
in which pleyel is bewildered

he may at least be accessible to fear has he nothing to fear from
the rage of an injured woman but suppose him inaccessible to such
inducements suppose him to persist in all his flagitious purposes are
not the means of defence and resistance in my power

in the progress of such thoughts was the resolution at last formed i
hoped that the interview was sought by him for a laudable end but be
that as it would i trusted that by energy of reasoning or of action i
should render it auspicious or at least harmless

such a determination must unavoidably fluctuate the poet's chaos was
no unapt emblem of the state of my mind a torment was awakened in my
bosom which i foresaw would end only when this interview was past and
its consequences fully experienced hence my impatience for the arrival
of the hour which had been prescribed by carwin

meanwhile my meditations were tumultuously active new impediments
to the execution of the scheme were speedily suggested i had apprized
catharine of my intention to spend this and many future nights with her
her husband was informed of this arrangement and had zealously approved
it eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of retiring what excuse should
i form for changing my plan should i shew this letter to wieland and
submit myself to his direction but i knew in what way he would decide
he would fervently dissuade me from going nay would he not do more
he was apprized of the offences of carwin and of the reward offered
for his apprehension would he not seize this opportunity of executing
justice on a criminal

this idea was new i was plunged once more into doubt did not equity
enjoin me thus to facilitate his arrest no i disdained the office of
betrayer carwin was unapprized of his danger and his intentions were
possibly beneficent should i station guards about the house and
make an act intended perhaps for my benefit instrumental to his own
destruction wieland might be justified in thus employing the knowledge
which i should impart but i by imparting it should pollute myself
with more hateful crimes than those undeservedly imputed to me this
scheme therefore i unhesitatingly rejected the views with which
i should return to my own house it would therefore be necessary to
conceal yet some pretext must be invented i had never been initiated
into the trade of lying yet what but falshood was a deliberate
suppression of the truth to deceive by silence or by words is the same

yet what would a lie avail me what pretext would justify this change in
my plan would it not tend to confirm the imputations of pleyel that
i should voluntarily return to an house in which honor and life had so
lately been endangered could be explained in no way favorable to my
integrity

these reflections if they did not change at least suspended my
decision in this state of uncertainty i alighted at the hut we gave
this name to the house tenanted by the farmer and his servants and
which was situated on the verge of my brother's ground and at a
considerable distance from the mansion the path to the mansion was
planted by a double row of walnuts along this path i proceeded alone
i entered the parlour in which was a light just expiring in the socket
there was no one in the room i perceived by the clock that stood
against the wall that it was near eleven the lateness of the hour
startled me what had become of the family they were usually retired
an hour before this but the unextinguished taper and the unbarred
door were indications that they had not retired i again returned to the
hall and passed from one room to another but still encountered not a
human being

i imagined that perhaps the lapse of a few minutes would explain
these appearances meanwhile i reflected that the preconcerted hour had
arrived carwin was perhaps waiting my approach should i immediately
retire to my own house no one would be apprized of my proceeding nay
the interview might pass and i be enabled to return in half an hour
hence no necessity would arise for dissimulation

i was so far influenced by these views that i rose to execute this
design but again the unusual condition of the house occurred to me and
some vague solicitude as to the condition of the family i was nearly
certain that my brother had not retired but by what motives he could
be induced to desert his house thus unseasonably i could by no means
divine louisa conway at least was at home and had probably retired
to her chamber perhaps she was able to impart the information i wanted

i went to her chamber and found her asleep she was delighted and
surprized at my arrival and told me with how much impatience and
anxiety my brother and his wife had waited my coming they were fearful
that some mishap had befallen me and had remained up longer than the
usual period notwithstanding the lateness of the hour catharine would
not resign the hope of seeing me louisa said she had left them both in
the parlour and she knew of no cause for their absence

as yet i was not without solicitude on account of their personal safety
i was far from being perfectly at ease on that head but entertained no
distinct conception of the danger that impended over them perhaps to
beguile the moments of my long protracted stay they had gone to
walk upon the bank the atmosphere though illuminated only by the
star-light was remarkably serene meanwhile the desirableness of an
interview with carwin again returned and i finally resolved to seek it

i passed with doubting and hasty steps along the path my dwelling seen
at a distance was gloomy and desolate it had no inhabitant for my
servant in consequence of my new arrangement had gone to mettingen
the temerity of this attempt began to shew itself in more vivid colours
to my understanding whoever has pointed steel is not without arms yet
what must have been the state of my mind when i could meditate without
shuddering on the use of a murderous weapon and believe myself secure
merely because i was capable of being made so by the death of another
yet this was not my state i felt as if i was rushing into deadly toils
without the power of pausing or receding



chapter xvi


as soon as i arrived in sight of the front of the house my attention
was excited by a light from the window of my own chamber no appearance
could be less explicable a meeting was expected with carwin but that
he pre-occupied my chamber and had supplied himself with light was not
to be believed what motive could influence him to adopt this conduct
could i proceed until this was explained perhaps if i should proceed
to a distance in front some one would be visible a sidelong but feeble
beam from the window fell upon the piny copse which skirted the bank
as i eyed it it suddenly became mutable and after flitting to and fro
for a short time it vanished i turned my eye again toward the window
and perceived that the light was still there but the change which i had
noticed was occasioned by a change in the position of the lamp or candle
within hence that some person was there was an unavoidable inference

i paused to deliberate on the propriety of advancing might i not
advance cautiously and therefore without danger might i not knock at
the door or call and be apprized of the nature of my visitant before i
entered i approached and listened at the door but could hear nothing
i knocked at first timidly but afterwards with loudness my signals
were unnoticed i stepped back and looked but the light was no longer
discernible was it suddenly extinguished by a human agent what purpose
but concealment was intended why was the illumination produced to be
thus suddenly brought to an end and why since some one was there had
silence been observed

these were questions the solution of which may be readily supposed
to be entangled with danger would not this danger when measured by a
woman's fears expand into gigantic dimensions menaces of death the
stunning exertions of a warning voice the known and unknown attributes
of carwin our recent interview in this chamber the pre-appointment of
a meeting at this place and hour all thronged into my memory what was
to be done

courage is no definite or stedfast principle let that man who shall
purpose to assign motives to the actions of another blush at his
folly and forbear not more presumptuous would it be to attempt the
classification of all nature and the scanning of supreme intelligence
i gazed for a minute at the window and fixed my eyes for a second
minute on the ground i drew forth from my pocket and opened a
penknife this said i be my safe-guard and avenger the assailant
shall perish or myself shall fall i had locked up the house in the
morning but had the key of the kitchen door in my pocket i therefore
determined to gain access behind thither i hastened unlocked and
entered all was lonely darksome and waste familiar as i was with
every part of my dwelling i easily found my way to a closet drew forth
a taper a flint tinder and steel and in a moment as it were gave
myself the guidance and protection of light

what purpose did i meditate should i explore my way to my chamber and
confront the being who had dared to intrude into this recess and had
laboured for concealment by putting out the light did he seek to hide
himself or mean only to circumvent my incautious steps yet was it
not more probable that he desired my absence by thus encouraging the
supposition that the house was unoccupied i would see this man in spite
of all impediments ere i died i would see his face and summon him
to penitence and retribution no matter at what cost an interview was
purchased reputation and life might be wrested from me by another but
my rectitude and honor were in my own keeping and were safe

i proceeded to the foot of the stairs at such a crisis my thoughts
may be supposed at no liberty to range yet vague images rushed into my
mind of the mysterious interposition which had been experienced on the
last night my case at present was not dissimilar and if my angel
were not weary of fruitless exertions to save might not a new warning
be expected who could say whether his silence were ascribable to the
absence of danger or to his own absence

in this state of mind no wonder that a shivering cold crept through
my veins that my pause was prolonged and that a fearful glance was
thrown backward

alas my heart droops and my fingers are enervated my ideas are
vivid but my language is faint now know i what it is to entertain
incommunicable sentiments the chain of subsequent incidents is drawn
through my mind and being linked with those which forewent by turns
rouse up agonies and sink me into hopelessness

yet i will persist to the end my narrative may be invaded by inaccuracy
and confusion but if i live no longer i will at least live to
complete it what but ambiguities abruptnesses and dark transitions
can be expected from the historian who is at the same time the
sufferer of these disasters

i have said that i cast a look behind some object was expected to be
seen or why should i have gazed in that direction two senses were at
once assailed the same piercing exclamation of hold hold was uttered
within the same distance of my ear this it was that i heard the airy
undulation and the shock given to my nerves were real whether the
spectacle which i beheld existed in my fancy or without might be
doubted i had not closed the door of the apartment i had just left the
stair-case at the foot of which i stood was eight or ten feet from
the door and attached to the wall through which the door led my view
therefore was sidelong and took in no part of the room

through this aperture was an head thrust and drawn back with so much
swiftness that the immediate conviction was that thus much of a form
ordinarily invisible had been unshrowded the face was turned towards
me every muscle was tense the forehead and brows were drawn into
vehement expression the lips were stretched as in the act of shrieking
and the eyes emitted sparks which no doubt if i had been unattended
by a light would have illuminated like the coruscations of a meteor
the sound and the vision were present and departed together at the
same instant but the cry was blown into my ear while the face was many
paces distant

this face was well suited to a being whose performances exceeded the
standard of humanity and yet its features were akin to those i had
before seen the image of carwin was blended in a thousand ways with the
stream of my thoughts this visage was perhaps pourtrayed by my fancy
if so it will excite no surprize that some of his lineaments were now
discovered yet affinities were few and unconspicuous and were lost
amidst the blaze of opposite qualities

what conclusion could i form be the face human or not the intimation
was imparted from above experience had evinced the benignity of that
being who gave it once he had interposed to shield me from harm and
subsequent events demonstrated the usefulness of that interposition now
was i again warned to forbear i was hurrying to the verge of the same
gulf and the same power was exerted to recall my steps was it possible
for me not to obey was i capable of holding on in the same perilous
career yes even of this i was capable

the intimation was imperfect it gave no form to my danger and
prescribed no limits to my caution i had formerly neglected it and yet
escaped might i not trust to the same issue this idea might possess
though imperceptibly some influence i persisted but it was not merely
on this account i cannot delineate the motives that led me on i now
speak as if no remnant of doubt existed in my mind as to the supernal
origin of these sounds but this is owing to the imperfection of my
language for i only mean that the belief was more permanent and
visited more frequently my sober meditations than its opposite the
immediate effects served only to undermine the foundations of my
judgment and precipitate my resolutions

i must either advance or return i chose the former and began to ascend
the stairs the silence underwent no second interruption my chamber
door was closed but unlocked and aided by vehement efforts of my
courage i opened and looked in

no hideous or uncommon object was discernible the danger indeed might
easily have lurked out of sight have sprung upon me as i entered and
have rent me with his iron talons but i was blind to this fate and
advanced though cautiously into the room

still every thing wore its accustomed aspect neither lamp nor candle
was to be found now for the first time suspicions were suggested as
to the nature of the light which i had seen was it possible to have
been the companion of that supernatural visage a meteorous refulgence
producible at the will of him to whom that visage belonged and
partaking of the nature of that which accompanied my father's death

the closet was near and i remembered the complicated horrors of which
it had been productive here perhaps was inclosed the source of my
peril and the gratification of my curiosity should i adventure once
more to explore its recesses this was a resolution not easily formed i
was suspended in thought when glancing my eye on a table i perceived a
written paper carwin's hand was instantly recognized and snatching up
the paper i read as follows 

there was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation judge
how i was disappointed in finding another in your place i have
waited but to wait any longer would be perilous i shall still seek an
interview but it must be at a different time and place meanwhile
i will write this how will you bear how inexplicable will be this
transaction an event so unexpected a sight so horrible

such was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script the ink was yet moist
the hand was that of carwin hence it was to be inferred that he had
this moment left the apartment or was still in it i looked back on
the sudden expectation of seeing him behind me

what other did he mean what transaction had taken place adverse to my
expectations what sight was about to be exhibited i looked around
me once more but saw nothing which indicated strangeness again i
remembered the closet and was resolved to seek in that the solution
of these mysteries here perhaps was inclosed the scene destined to
awaken my horrors and baffle my foresight

i have already said that the entrance into this closet was beside my
bed which on two sides was closely shrowded by curtains on that side
nearest the closet the curtain was raised as i passed along i cast my
eye thither i started and looked again i bore a light in my hand and
brought it nearer my eyes in order to dispel any illusive mists that
might have hovered before them once more i fixed my eyes upon the bed
in hope that this more stedfast scrutiny would annihilate the object
which before seemed to be there

this then was the sight which carwin had predicted this was the event
which my understanding was to find inexplicable this was the fate
which had been reserved for me but which by some untoward chance had
befallen on another

i had not been terrified by empty menaces violation and death awaited
my entrance into this chamber some inscrutable chance had led her
hither before me and the merciless fangs of which i was designed to
be the prey had mistaken their victim and had fixed themselves in her
heart but where was my safety was the mischief exhausted or flown the
steps of the assassin had just been here they could not be far off in
a moment he would rush into my presence and i should perish under the
same polluting and suffocating grasp

my frame shook and my knees were unable to support me i gazed
alternately at the closet door and at the door of my room at one of
these avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life i
was prepared for defence but now that danger was imminent my means
of defence and my power to use them were gone i was not qualified by
education and experience to encounter perils like these or perhaps
i was powerless because i was again assaulted by surprize and had not
fortified my mind by foresight and previous reflection against a scene
like this

fears for my own safety again yielded place to reflections on the scene
before me i fixed my eyes upon her countenance my sister's well-known
and beloved features could not be concealed by convulsion or lividness
what direful illusion led thee hither bereft of thee what hold on
happiness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse to lose thee by a
common fate would have been sufficiently hard but thus suddenly to
perish to become the prey of this ghastly death how will a spectacle
like this be endured by wieland to die beneath his grasp would not
satisfy thy enemy this was mercy to the evils which he previously made
thee suffer after these evils death was a boon which thou besoughtest
him to grant he entertained no enmity against thee i was the object of
his treason but by some tremendous mistake his fury was misplaced but
how comest thou hither and where was wieland in thy hour of distress

i approached the corpse i lifted the still flexible hand and kissed
the lips which were breathless her flowing drapery was discomposed
i restored it to order and seating myself on the bed again fixed
stedfast eyes upon her countenance i cannot distinctly recollect the
ruminations of that moment i saw confusedly but forcibly that every
hope was extinguished with the life of catharine all happiness and
dignity must henceforth be banished from the house and name of wieland
all that remained was to linger out in agonies a short existence and
leave to the world a monument of blasted hopes and changeable fortune
pleyel was already lost to me yet while catharine lived life was not
a detestable possession but now severed from the companion of my
infancy the partaker of all my thoughts my cares and my wishes i
was like one set afloat upon a stormy sea and hanging his safety upon a
plank night was closing upon him and an unexpected surge had torn him
from his hold and overwhelmed him forever



chapter xvii


i had no inclination nor power to move from this spot for more than an
hour my faculties and limbs seemed to be deprived of all activity
the door below creaked on its hinges and steps ascended the stairs my
wandering and confused thoughts were instantly recalled by these sounds
and dropping the curtain of the bed i moved to a part of the room
where any one who entered should be visible such are the vibrations of
sentiment that notwithstanding the seeming fulfilment of my fears
and increase of my danger i was conscious on this occasion to no
turbulence but that of curiosity

at length he entered the apartment and i recognized my brother it was
the same wieland whom i had ever seen yet his features were pervaded by
a new expression i supposed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife
and his appearance confirmed this persuasion a brow expanding into
exultation i had hitherto never seen in him yet such a brow did he now
wear not only was he unapprized of the disaster that had happened
but some joyous occurrence had betided what a reverse was preparing to
annihilate his transitory bliss no husband ever doated more fondly for
no wife ever claimed so boundless a devotion i was not uncertain as to
the effects to flow from the discovery of her fate i confided not at
all in the efforts of his reason or his piety there were few evils
which his modes of thinking would not disarm of their sting but here
all opiates to grief and all compellers of patience were vain this
spectacle would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of desperation
and a rushing to death

for the present i neglected to ask myself what motive brought him
hither i was only fearful of the effects to flow from the sight of the
dead yet could it be long concealed from him some time and speedily
he would obtain this knowledge no stratagems could considerably or
usefully prolong his ignorance all that could be sought was to take
away the abruptness of the change and shut out the confusion of
despair and the inroads of madness but i knew my brother and knew
that all exertions to console him would be fruitless

what could i say i was mute and poured forth those tears on his
account which my own unhappiness had been unable to extort in the
midst of my tears i was not unobservant of his motions these were of
a nature to rouse some other sentiment than grief or at least to mix
with it a portion of astonishment

his countenance suddenly became troubled his hands were clasped with a
force that left the print of his nails in his flesh his eyes were fixed
on my feet his brain seemed to swell beyond its continent he did not
cease to breathe but his breath was stifled into groans i had never
witnessed the hurricane of human passions my element had till lately
been all sunshine and calm i was unconversant with the altitudes and
energies of sentiment and was transfixed with inexplicable horror by
the symptoms which i now beheld

after a silence and a conflict which i could not interpret he lifted
his eyes to heaven and in broken accents exclaimed this is too much
any victim but this and thy will be done have i not sufficiently
attested my faith and my obedience she that is gone they that have
perished were linked with my soul by ties which only thy command would
have broken but here is sanctity and excellence surpassing human this
workmanship is thine and it cannot be thy will to heap it into ruins

here suddenly unclasping his hands he struck one of them against his
forehead and continued wretch who made thee quicksighted in the
councils of thy maker deliverance from mortal fetters is awarded to
this being and thou art the minister of this decree

so saying wieland advanced towards me his words and his motions were
without meaning except on one supposition the death of catharine was
already known to him and that knowledge as might have been suspected
had destroyed his reason i had feared nothing less but now that i
beheld the extinction of a mind the most luminous and penetrating that
ever dignified the human form my sensations were fraught with new and
insupportable anguish

i had not time to reflect in what way my own safety would be effected by
this revolution or what i had to dread from the wild conceptions of a
madman he advanced towards me some hollow noises were wafted by the
breeze confused clamours were succeeded by many feet traversing the
grass and then crowding into the piazza

these sounds suspended my brother's purpose and he stood to listen the
signals multiplied and grew louder perceiving this he turned from me
and hurried out of my sight all about me was pregnant with motives to
astonishment my sister's corpse wieland's frantic demeanour and at
length this crowd of visitants so little accorded with my foresight
that my mental progress was stopped the impulse had ceased which was
accustomed to give motion and order to my thoughts

footsteps thronged upon the stairs and presently many faces shewed
themselves within the door of my apartment these looks were full of
alarm and watchfulness they pryed into corners as if in search of
some fugitive next their gaze was fixed upon me and betokened all the
vehemence of terror and pity for a time i questioned whether these were
not shapes and faces like that which i had seen at the bottom of the
stairs creatures of my fancy or airy existences my eye wandered from
one to another till at length it fell on a countenance which i well
knew it was that of mr hallet this man was a distant kinsman of my
mother venerable for his age his uprightness and sagacity he had
long discharged the functions of a magistrate and good citizen if any
terrors remained his presence was sufficient to dispel them

he approached took my hand with a compassionate air and said in a low
voice where my dear clara are your brother and sister i made no
answer but pointed to the bed his attendants drew aside the curtain
and while their eyes glared with horror at the spectacle which they
beheld those of mr hallet overflowed with tears

after considerable pause he once more turned to me my dear girl
this sight is not for you can you confide in my care and that of mrs
baynton's we will see performed all that circumstances require

i made strenuous opposition to this request i insisted on remaining
near her till she were interred his remonstrances however and my own
feelings shewed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction louisa
stood in need of a comforter and my brother's children of a nurse my
unhappy brother was himself an object of solicitude and care at length
i consented to relinquish the corpse and go to my brother's whose
house i said would need mistress and his children a parent

during this discourse my venerable friend struggled with his tears but
my last intimation called them forth with fresh violence meanwhile
his attendants stood round in mournful silence gazing on me and at each
other i repeated my resolution and rose to execute it but he took my
hand to detain me his countenance betrayed irresolution and reluctance
i requested him to state the reason of his opposition to this measure
i entreated him to be explicit i told him that my brother had just been
there and that i knew his condition this misfortune had driven him
to madness and his offspring must not want a protector if he chose
i would resign wieland to his care but his innocent and helpless babes
stood in instant need of nurse and mother and these offices i would by
no means allow another to perform while i had life

every word that i uttered seemed to augment his perplexity and distress
at last he said i think clara i have entitled myself to some regard
from you you have professed your willingness to oblige me now i call
upon you to confer upon me the highest obligation in your power permit
mrs baynton to have the management of your brother's house for two or
three days then it shall be yours to act in it as you please no matter
what are my motives in making this request perhaps i think your
age your sex or the distress which this disaster must occasion
incapacitates you for the office surely you have no doubt of mrs
baynton's tenderness or discretion new ideas now rushed into my mind
i fixed my eyes stedfastly on mr hallet are they well said i is
louisa well are benjamin and william and constantine and little
clara are they safe tell me truly i beseech you

they are well he replied they are perfectly safe

fear no effeminate weakness in me i can bear to hear the truth tell
me truly are they well

he again assured me that they were well

what then resumed i do you fear is it possible for any calamity to
disqualify me for performing my duty to these helpless innocents i
am willing to divide the care of them with mrs baynton i shall be
grateful for her sympathy and aid but what should i be to desert them
at an hour like this

i will cut short this distressful dialogue i still persisted in my
purpose and he still persisted in his opposition this excited my
suspicions anew but these were removed by solemn declarations of their
safety i could not explain this conduct in my friend but at length
consented to go to the city provided i should see them for a few
minutes at present and should return on the morrow

even this arrangement was objected to at length he told me they were
removed to the city why were they removed i asked and whither my
importunities would not now be eluded my suspicions were roused and no
evasion or artifice was sufficient to allay them many of the audience
began to give vent to their emotions in tears mr hallet himself seemed
as if the conflict were too hard to be longer sustained something
whispered to my heart that havoc had been wider than i now witnessed
i suspected this concealment to arise from apprehensions of the
effects which a knowledge of the truth would produce in me i once
more entreated him to inform me truly of their state to enforce my
entreaties i put on an air of insensibility i can guess said i
what has happened they are indeed beyond the reach of injury for they
are dead is it not so my voice faltered in spite of my courageous
efforts

yes said he they are dead dead by the same fate and by the same
hand with their mother

dead replied i what all

all replied he he spared not one

allow me my friends to close my eyes upon the after-scene why should
i protract a tale which i already begin to feel is too long over this
scene at least let me pass lightly here indeed my narrative would be
imperfect all was tempestuous commotion in my heart and in my brain i
have no memory for ought but unconscious transitions and rueful sights
i was ingenious and indefatigable in the invention of torments i would
not dispense with any spectacle adapted to exasperate my grief each
pale and mangled form i crushed to my bosom louisa whom i loved with
so ineffable a passion was denied to me at first but my obstinacy
conquered their reluctance

they led the way into a darkened hall a lamp pendant from the ceiling
was uncovered and they pointed to a table the assassin had defrauded
me of my last and miserable consolation i sought not in her visage for
the tinge of the morning and the lustre of heaven these had vanished
with life but i hoped for liberty to print a last kiss upon her lips
this was denied me for such had been the merciless blow that destroyed
her that not a lineament remained

i was carried hence to the city mrs hallet was my companion and my
nurse why should i dwell upon the rage of fever and the effusions
of delirium carwin was the phantom that pursued my dreams the giant
oppressor under whose arm i was for ever on the point of being crushed
strenuous muscles were required to hinder my flight and hearts of steel
to withstand the eloquence of my fears in vain i called upon them to
look upward to mark his sparkling rage and scowling contempt all i
sought was to fly from the stroke that was lifted then i heaped upon my
guards the most vehement reproaches or betook myself to wailings on the
haplessness of my condition

this malady at length declined and my weeping friends began to look
for my restoration slowly and with intermitted beams memory revisited
me the scenes that i had witnessed were revived became the theme
of deliberation and deduction and called forth the effusions of more
rational sorrow



chapter xviii


i had imperfectly recovered my strength when i was informed of the
arrival of my mother's brother thomas cambridge ten years since he
went to europe and was a surgeon in the british forces in germany
during the whole of the late war after its conclusion some connection
that he had formed with an irish officer made him retire into ireland
intercourse had been punctually maintained by letters with his sister's
children and hopes were given that he would shortly return to his
native country and pass his old age in our society he was now in an
evil hour arrived

i desired an interview with him for numerous and urgent reasons with
the first returns of my understanding i had anxiously sought information
of the fate of my brother during the course of my disease i had never
seen him and vague and unsatisfactory answers were returned to all my
inquires i had vehemently interrogated mrs hallet and her husband and
solicited an interview with this unfortunate man but they mysteriously
insinuated that his reason was still unsettled and that his
circumstances rendered an interview impossible their reserve on the
particulars of this destruction and the author of it was equally
invincible

for some time finding all my efforts fruitless i had desisted from
direct inquiries and solicitations determined as soon as my strength
was sufficiently renewed to pursue other means of dispelling my
uncertainty in this state of things my uncle's arrival and intention to
visit me were announced i almost shuddered to behold the face of this
man when i reflected on the disasters that had befallen us i was half
unwilling to witness that dejection and grief which would be disclosed
in his countenance but i believed that all transactions had been
thoroughly disclosed to him and confided in my importunity to extort
from him the knowledge that i sought

i had no doubt as to the person of our enemy but the motives that urged
him to perpetrate these horrors the means that he used and his present
condition were totally unknown it was reasonable to expect some
information on this head from my uncle i therefore waited his coming
with impatience at length in the dusk of the evening and in my
solitary chamber this meeting took place

this man was our nearest relation and had ever treated us with the
affection of a parent our meeting therefore could not be without
overflowing tenderness and gloomy joy he rather encouraged than
restrained the tears that i poured out in his arms and took upon
himself the task of comforter allusions to recent disasters could not
be long omitted one topic facilitated the admission of another at
length i mentioned and deplored the ignorance in which i had been
kept respecting my brother's destiny and the circumstances of our
misfortunes i entreated him to tell me what was wieland's condition
and what progress had been made in detecting or punishing the author of
this unheard-of devastation

the author said he do you know the author

alas i answered i am too well acquainted with him the story of
the grounds of my suspicions would be painful and too long i am not
apprized of the extent of your present knowledge there are none but
wieland pleyel and myself who are able to relate certain facts

spare yourself the pain said he all that wieland and pleyel can
communicate i know already if any thing of moment has fallen within
your own exclusive knowledge and the relation be not too arduous for
your present strength i confess i am desirous of hearing it perhaps
you allude to one by the name of carwin i will anticipate your
curiosity by saying that since these disasters no one has seen or
heard of him his agency is therefore a mystery still unsolved

i readily complied with his request and related as distinctly as
i could though in general terms the events transacted in the
summer-house and my chamber he listened without apparent surprize
to the tale of pleyel's errors and suspicions and with augmented
seriousness to my narrative of the warnings and inexplicable vision
and the letter found upon the table i waited for his comments

you gather from this said he that carwin is the author of all this
misery

is it not answered i an unavoidable inference but what know you
respecting it was it possible to execute this mischief without witness
or coadjutor i beseech you to relate to me when and why mr hallet was
summoned to the scene and by whom this disaster was first suspected
or discovered surely suspicion must have fallen upon some one and
pursuit was made

my uncle rose from his seat and traversed the floor with hasty steps
his eyes were fixed upon the ground and he seemed buried in perplexity
at length he paused and said with an emphatic tone it is true the
instrument is known carwin may have plotted but the execution was
another's that other is found and his deed is ascertained

good heaven i exclaimed what say you was not carwin the assassin
could any hand but his have carried into act this dreadful purpose

have i not said returned he that the performance was another's
carwin perhaps or heaven or insanity prompted the murderer but
carwin is unknown the actual performer has long since been called
to judgment and convicted and is at this moment at the bottom of a
dungeon loaded with chains

i lifted my hands and eyes who then is this assassin by what means
and whither was he traced what is the testimony of his guilt

his own corroborated with that of a servant-maid who spied the murder
of the children from a closet where she was concealed the magistrate
returned from your dwelling to your brother's he was employed in
hearing and recording the testimony of the only witness when the
criminal himself unexpected unsolicited unsought entered the hall
acknowledged his guilt and rendered himself up to justice

he has since been summoned to the bar the audience was composed of
thousands whom rumours of this wonderful event had attracted from the
greatest distance a long and impartial examination was made and the
prisoner was called upon for his defence in compliance with this call
he delivered an ample relation of his motives and actions there he
stopped

i besought him to say who this criminal was and what the instigations
that compelled him my uncle was silent i urged this inquiry with new
force i reverted to my own knowledge and sought in this some basis to
conjecture i ran over the scanty catalogue of the men whom i knew i
lighted on no one who was qualified for ministering to malice like this
again i resorted to importunity had i ever seen the criminal was it
sheer cruelty or diabolical revenge that produced this overthrow

he surveyed me for a considerable time and listened to my
interrogations in silence at length he spoke clara i have known thee
by report and in some degree by observation thou art a being of no
vulgar sort thy friends have hitherto treated thee as a child they
meant well but perhaps they were unacquainted with thy strength i
assure myself that nothing will surpass thy fortitude

thou art anxious to know the destroyer of thy family his actions and
his motives shall i call him to thy presence and permit him to confess
before thee shall i make him the narrator of his own tale

i started on my feet and looked round me with fearful glances as if
the murderer was close at hand what do you mean said i put an end
i beseech you to this suspence

be not alarmed you will never more behold the face of this criminal
unless he be gifted with supernatural strength and sever like threads
the constraint of links and bolts i have said that the assassin was
arraigned at the bar and that the trial ended with a summons from the
judge to confess or to vindicate his actions a reply was immediately
made with significance of gesture and a tranquil majesty which denoted
less of humanity than godhead judges advocates and auditors were
panic-struck and breathless with attention one of the hearers
faithfully recorded the speech there it is continued he putting a
roll of papers in my hand you may read it at your leisure

with these words my uncle left me alone my curiosity refused me a
moment's delay i opened the papers and read as follows



chapter xix


theodore wieland the prisoner at the bar was now called upon for his
defence he looked around him for some time in silence and with a mild
countenance at length he spoke

it is strange i am known to my judges and my auditors who is there
present a stranger to the character of wieland who knows him not as an
husband as a father as a friend yet here am i arraigned as criminal
i am charged with diabolical malice i am accused of the murder of my
wife and my children

it is true they were slain by me they all perished by my hand
the task of vindication is ignoble what is it that i am called to
vindicate and before whom

you know that they are dead and that they were killed by me what more
would you have would you extort from me a statement of my motives have
you failed to discover them already you charge me with malice but your
eyes are not shut your reason is still vigorous your memory has not
forsaken you you know whom it is that you thus charge the habits of
his life are known to you his treatment of his wife and his
offspring is known to you the soundness of his integrity and the
unchangeableness of his principles are familiar to your apprehension
yet you persist in this charge you lead me hither manacled as a felon
you deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting death

who are they whom i have devoted to death my wife the little ones
that drew their being from me that creature who as she surpassed
them in excellence claimed a larger affection than those whom natural
affinities bound to my heart think ye that malice could have urged me
to this deed hide your audacious fronts from the scrutiny of heaven
take refuge in some cavern unvisited by human eyes ye may deplore your
wickedness or folly but ye cannot expiate it

think not that i speak for your sakes hug to your hearts this
detestable infatuation deem me still a murderer and drag me to
untimely death i make not an effort to dispel your illusion i utter
not a word to cure you of your sanguinary folly but there are probably
some in this assembly who have come from far for their sakes whose
distance has disabled them from knowing me i will tell what i have
done and why

it is needless to say that god is the object of my supreme passion
i have cherished in his presence a single and upright heart i have
thirsted for the knowledge of his will i have burnt with ardour to
approve my faith and my obedience

my days have been spent in searching for the revelation of that will
but my days have been mournful because my search failed i solicited
direction i turned on every side where glimmerings of light could be
discovered i have not been wholly uninformed but my knowledge has
always stopped short of certainty dissatisfaction has insinuated
itself into all my thoughts my purposes have been pure my wishes
indefatigable but not till lately were these purposes thoroughly
accomplished and these wishes fully gratified

i thank thee my father for thy bounty that thou didst not ask a less
sacrifice than this that thou placedst me in a condition to testify my
submission to thy will what have i withheld which it was thy pleasure
to exact now may i with dauntless and erect eye claim my reward
since i have given thee the treasure of my soul

i was at my own house it was late in the evening my sister had gone
to the city but proposed to return it was in expectation of her return
that my wife and i delayed going to bed beyond the usual hour the rest
of the family however were retired

my mind was contemplative and calm not wholly devoid of apprehension
on account of my sister's safety recent events not easily explained
had suggested the existence of some danger but this danger was
without a distinct form in our imagination and scarcely ruffled our
tranquillity

time passed and my sister did not arrive her house is at some
distance from mine and though her arrangements had been made with a
view to residing with us it was possible that through forgetfulness
or the occurrence of unforeseen emergencies she had returned to her own
dwelling

hence it was conceived proper that i should ascertain the truth by
going thither i went on my way my mind was full of these ideas
which related to my intellectual condition in the torrent of fervid
conceptions i lost sight of my purpose some times i stood still
some times i wandered from my path and experienced some difficulty on
recovering from my fit of musing to regain it

the series of my thoughts is easily traced at first every vein beat
with raptures known only to the man whose parental and conjugal love
is without limits and the cup of whose desires immense as it is
overflows with gratification i know not why emotions that were
perpetual visitants should now have recurred with unusual energy the
transition was not new from sensations of joy to a consciousness of
gratitude the author of my being was likewise the dispenser of every
gift with which that being was embellished the service to which a
benefactor like this was entitled could not be circumscribed my social
sentiments were indebted to their alliance with devotion for all their
value all passions are base all joys feeble all energies malignant
which are not drawn from this source

for a time my contemplations soared above earth and its inhabitants
i stretched forth my hands i lifted my eyes and exclaimed o that i
might be admitted to thy presence that mine were the supreme delight of
knowing thy will and of performing it the blissful privilege of direct
communication with thee and of listening to the audible enunciation of
thy pleasure

what task would i not undertake what privation would i not cheerfully
endure to testify my love of thee alas thou hidest thyself from my
view glimpses only of thy excellence and beauty are afforded me would
that a momentary emanation from thy glory would visit me that some
unambiguous token of thy presence would salute my senses

in this mood i entered the house of my sister it was vacant scarcely
had i regained recollection of the purpose that brought me hither
thoughts of a different tendency had such absolute possession of my
mind that the relations of time and space were almost obliterated from
my understanding these wanderings however were restrained and i
ascended to her chamber

i had no light and might have known by external observation that
the house was without any inhabitant with this however i was
not satisfied i entered the room and the object of my search not
appearing i prepared to return

the darkness required some caution in descending the stair i stretched
my hand to seize the balustrade by which i might regulate my steps
how shall i describe the lustre which at that moment burst upon my
vision

i was dazzled my organs were bereaved of their activity my eye-lids
were half-closed and my hands withdrawn from the balustrade a nameless
fear chilled my veins and i stood motionless this irradiation did not
retire or lessen it seemed as if some powerful effulgence covered me
like a mantle

i opened my eyes and found all about me luminous and glowing it was
the element of heaven that flowed around nothing but a fiery stream was
at first visible but anon a shrill voice from behind called upon me
to attend

i turned it is forbidden to describe what i saw words indeed would
be wanting to the task the lineaments of that being whose veil was now
lifted and whose visage beamed upon my sight no hues of pencil or of
language can pourtray

as it spoke the accents thrilled to my heart thy prayers are heard
in proof of thy faith render me thy wife this is the victim i chuse
call her hither and here let her fall the sound and visage and
light vanished at once

what demand was this the blood of catharine was to be shed my wife
was to perish by my hand i sought opportunity to attest my virtue
little did i expect that a proof like this would have been demanded

my wife i exclaimed o god substitute some other victim make me
not the butcher of my wife my own blood is cheap this will i pour
out before thee with a willing heart but spare i beseech thee this
precious life or commission some other than her husband to perform the
bloody deed

in vain the conditions were prescribed the decree had gone forth and
nothing remained but to execute it i rushed out of the house and across
the intermediate fields and stopped not till i entered my own parlour
my wife had remained here during my absence in anxious expectation of
my return with some tidings of her sister i had none to communicate
for a time i was breathless with my speed this and the tremors
that shook my frame and the wildness of my looks alarmed her she
immediately suspected some disaster to have happened to her friend and
her own speech was as much overpowered by emotion as mine

she was silent but her looks manifested her impatience to hear what i
had to communicate i spoke but with so much precipitation as scarcely
to be understood catching her at the same time by the arm and
forcibly pulling her from her seat

come along with me fly waste not a moment time will be lost and the
deed will be omitted tarry not question not but fly with me

this deportment added afresh to her alarms her eyes pursued mine and
she said what is the matter for god's sake what is the matter where
would you have me go

my eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke i thought
upon her virtues i viewed her as the mother of my babes as my wife
i recalled the purpose for which i thus urged her attendance my heart
faltered and i saw that i must rouse to this work all my faculties the
danger of the least delay was imminent

i looked away from her and again exerting my force drew her towards
the door you must go with me indeed you must

in her fright she half-resisted my efforts and again exclaimed good
heaven what is it you mean where go what has happened have you found
clara

follow me and you will see i answered still urging her reluctant
steps forward

what phrenzy has seized you something must needs have happened is she
sick have you found her

come and see follow me and know for yourself

still she expostulated and besought me to explain this mysterious
behaviour i could not trust myself to answer her to look at her but
grasping her arm i drew her after me she hesitated rather through
confusion of mind than from unwillingness to accompany me this
confusion gradually abated and she moved forward but with irresolute
footsteps and continual exclamations of wonder and terror her
interrogations of what was the matter and whither was i going were
ceaseless and vehement

it was the scope of my efforts not to think to keep up a conflict and
uproar in my mind in which all order and distinctness should be lost
to escape from the sensations produced by her voice i was therefore
silent i strove to abridge this interval by my haste and to waste all
my attention in furious gesticulations

in this state of mind we reached my sister's door she looked at the
windows and saw that all was desolate why come we here there is no
body here i will not go in

still i was dumb but opening the door i drew her into the entry this
was the allotted scene here she was to fall i let go her hand and
pressing my palms against my forehead made one mighty effort to work up
my soul to the deed

in vain it would not be my courage was appalled my arms nerveless
i muttered prayers that my strength might be aided from above they
availed nothing

horror diffused itself over me this conviction of my cowardice my
rebellion fastened upon me and i stood rigid and cold as marble from
this state i was somewhat relieved by my wife's voice who renewed her
supplications to be told why we came hither and what was the fate of my
sister

what could i answer my words were broken and inarticulate her fears
naturally acquired force from the observation of these symptoms but
these fears were misplaced the only inference she deduced from my
conduct was that some terrible mishap had befallen clara

she wrung her hands and exclaimed in an agony o tell me where is
she what has become of her is she sick dead is she in her chamber o
let me go thither and know the worst

this proposal set my thoughts once more in motion perhaps what my
rebellious heart refused to perform here i might obtain strength enough
to execute elsewhere

come then said i let us go

i will but not in the dark we must first procure a light

fly then and procure it but i charge you linger not i will await for
your return

while she was gone i strode along the entry the fellness of a gloomy
hurricane but faintly resembled the discord that reigned in my mind to
omit this sacrifice must not be yet my sinews had refused to perform
it no alternative was offered to rebel against the mandate was
impossible but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife my
will was strong but my limbs refused their office

she returned with a light i led the way to the chamber she looked
round her she lifted the curtain of the bed she saw nothing

at length she fixed inquiring eyes upon me the light now enabled her
to discover in my visage what darkness had hitherto concealed her
cares were now transferred from my sister to myself and she said in
a tremulous voice wieland you are not well what ails you can i do
nothing for you

that accents and looks so winning should disarm me of my resolution
was to be expected my thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy i spread
my hand before my eyes that i might not see her and answered only by
groans she took my other hand between her's and pressing it to her
heart spoke with that voice which had ever swayed my will and wafted
away sorrow

my friend my soul's friend tell me thy cause of grief do i not merit
to partake with thee in thy cares am i not thy wife

this was too much i broke from her embrace and retired to a corner
of the room in this pause courage was once more infused into me i
resolved to execute my duty she followed me and renewed her passionate
entreaties to know the cause of my distress

i raised my head and regarded her with stedfast looks i muttered
something about death and the injunctions of my duty at these words
she shrunk back and looked at me with a new expression of anguish
after a pause she clasped her hands and exclaimed 

o wieland wieland god grant that i am mistaken but surely something
is wrong i see it it is too plain thou art undone lost to me and
to thyself at the same time she gazed on my features with intensest
anxiety in hope that different symptoms would take place i replied to
her with vehemence 

undone no my duty is known and i thank my god that my cowardice is
now vanquished and i have power to fulfil it catharine i pity the
weakness of thy nature i pity thee but must not spare thy life is
claimed from my hands thou must die

fear was now added to her grief what mean you why talk you of death
bethink yourself wieland bethink yourself and this fit will pass o
why came i hither why did you drag me hither

i brought thee hither to fulfil a divine command i am appointed thy
destroyer and destroy thee i must saying this i seized her wrists
she shrieked aloud and endeavoured to free herself from my grasp but
her efforts were vain

surely surely wieland thou dost not mean it am i not thy wife and
wouldst thou kill me thou wilt not and yet i see thou art wieland
no longer a fury resistless and horrible possesses thee spare
me spare help help 

till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help for mercy when
she could speak no longer her gestures her looks appealed to my
compassion my accursed hand was irresolute and tremulous i meant
thy death to be sudden thy struggles to be brief alas my heart was
infirm my resolves mutable thrice i slackened my grasp and life kept
its hold though in the midst of pangs her eye-balls started from their
sockets grimness and distortion took place of all that used to bewitch
me into transport and subdue me into reverence

i was commissioned to kill thee but not to torment thee with the
foresight of thy death not to multiply thy fears and prolong thy
agonies haggard and pale and lifeless at length thou ceasedst to
contend with thy destiny

this was a moment of triumph thus had i successfully subdued the
stubbornness of human passions the victim which had been demanded was
given the deed was done past recal

i lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed i gazed upon
it with delight such was the elation of my thoughts that i even broke
into laughter i clapped my hands and exclaimed it is done my sacred
duty is fulfilled to that i have sacrificed o my god thy last and
best gift my wife

for a while i thus soared above frailty i imagined i had set myself
forever beyond the reach of selfishness but my imaginations were false
this rapture quickly subsided i looked again at my wife my joyous
ebullitions vanished and i asked myself who it was whom i saw
methought it could not be catharine it could not be the woman who had
lodged for years in my heart who had slept nightly in my bosom who
had borne in her womb who had fostered at her breast the beings who
called me father whom i had watched with delight and cherished with a
fondness ever new and perpetually growing it could not be the same

where was her bloom these deadly and blood-suffused orbs but ill
resemble the azure and exstatic tenderness of her eyes the lucid stream
that meandered over that bosom the glow of love that was wont to sit
upon that cheek are much unlike these livid stains and this hideous
deformity alas these were the traces of agony the gripe of the
assassin had been here

i will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and outrageous sorrow
the breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn and i sunk into
mere man i leaped from the floor i dashed my head against the wall
i uttered screams of horror i panted after torment and pain eternal
fire and the bickerings of hell compared with what i felt were music
and a bed of roses

i thank my god that this degeneracy was transient that he deigned once
more to raise me aloft i thought upon what i had done as a sacrifice to
duty and was calm my wife was dead but i reflected that though this
source of human consolation was closed yet others were still open if
the transports of an husband were no more the feelings of a father had
still scope for exercise when remembrance of their mother should excite
too keen a pang i would look upon them and be comforted

while i revolved these ideas new warmth flowed in upon my heart i was
wrong these feelings were the growth of selfishness of this i was
not aware and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions a new
effulgence and a new mandate were necessary

from these thoughts i was recalled by a ray that was shot into the
room a voice spake like that which i had before heard thou hast done
well but all is not done the sacrifice is incomplete thy children
must be offered they must perish with their mother 



chapter xx


will you wonder that i read no farther will you not rather be
astonished that i read thus far what power supported me through such a
task i know not perhaps the doubt from which i could not disengage
my mind that the scene here depicted was a dream contributed to my
perseverance in vain the solemn introduction of my uncle his appeals
to my fortitude and allusions to something monstrous in the events
he was about to disclose in vain the distressful perplexity the
mysterious silence and ambiguous answers of my attendants especially
when the condition of my brother was the theme of my inquiries were
remembered i recalled the interview with wieland in my chamber his
preternatural tranquillity succeeded by bursts of passion and menacing
actions all these coincided with the tenor of this paper

catharine and her children and louisa were dead the act that destroyed
them was in the highest degree inhuman it was worthy of savages
trained to murder and exulting in agonies

who was the performer of the deed wieland my brother the husband
and the father that man of gentle virtues and invincible benignity
placable and mild an idolator of peace surely said i it is a dream
for many days have i been vexed with frenzy its dominion is still felt
but new forms are called up to diversify and augment my torments

the paper dropped from my hand and my eyes followed it i shrunk back
as if to avoid some petrifying influence that approached me my tongue
was mute all the functions of nature were at a stand and i sunk upon
the floor lifeless the noise of my fall as i afterwards heard alarmed
my uncle who was in a lower apartment and whose apprehensions had
detained him he hastened to my chamber and administered the assistance
which my condition required when i opened my eyes i beheld him before
me his skill as a reasoner as well as a physician was exerted to
obviate the injurious effects of this disclosure but he had wrongly
estimated the strength of my body or of my mind this new shock brought
me once more to the brink of the grave and my malady was much more
difficult to subdue than at first

i will not dwell upon the long train of dreary sensations and the
hideous confusion of my understanding time slowly restored its
customary firmness to my frame and order to my thoughts the images
impressed upon my mind by this fatal paper were somewhat effaced by my
malady they were obscure and disjointed like the parts of a dream i
was desirous of freeing my imagination from this chaos for this end i
questioned my uncle who was my constant companion he was intimidated
by the issue of his first experiment and took pains to elude or
discourage my inquiry my impetuosity some times compelled him to have
resort to misrepresentations and untruths

time effected that end perhaps in a more beneficial manner in the
course of my meditations the recollections of the past gradually became
more distinct i revolved them however in silence and being no longer
accompanied with surprize they did not exercise a death-dealing
power i had discontinued the perusal of the paper in the midst of
the narrative but what i read combined with information elsewhere
obtained threw perhaps a sufficient light upon these detestable
transactions yet my curiosity was not inactive i desired to peruse the
remainder

my eagerness to know the particulars of this tale was mingled and abated
by my antipathy to the scene which would be disclosed hence i employed
no means to effect my purpose i desired knowledge and at the same
time shrunk back from receiving the boon

one morning being left alone i rose from my bed and went to a drawer
where my finer clothing used to be kept i opened it and this fatal
paper saluted my sight i snatched it involuntarily and withdrew to a
chair i debated for a few minutes whether i should open and read now
that my fortitude was put to trial it failed i felt myself incapable
of deliberately surveying a scene of so much horror i was prompted to
return it to its place but this resolution gave way and i determined
to peruse some part of it i turned over the leaves till i came near the
conclusion the narrative of the criminal was finished the verdict of
guilty reluctantly pronounced by the jury and the accused interrogated
why sentence of death should not pass the answer was brief solemn and
emphatical

no i have nothing to say my tale has been told my motives have
been truly stated if my judges are unable to discern the purity of my
intentions or to credit the statement of them which i have just made
if they see not that my deed was enjoined by heaven that obedience was
the test of perfect virtue and the extinction of selfishness and error
they must pronounce me a murderer

they refuse to credit my tale they impute my acts to the influence of
daemons they account me an example of the highest wickedness of which
human nature is capable they doom me to death and infamy have i power
to escape this evil if i have be sure i will exert it i will not
accept evil at their hand when i am entitled to good i will suffer
only when i cannot elude suffering

you say that i am guilty impious and rash thus to usurp the
prerogatives of your maker to set up your bounded views and halting
reason as the measure of truth

thou omnipotent and holy thou knowest that my actions were
conformable to thy will i know not what is crime what actions are
evil in their ultimate and comprehensive tendency or what are good thy
knowledge as thy power is unlimited i have taken thee for my guide
and cannot err to the arms of thy protection i entrust my safety in
the awards of thy justice i confide for my recompense

come death when it will i am safe let calumny and abhorrence pursue
me among men i shall not be defrauded of my dues the peace of virtue
and the glory of obedience will be my portion hereafter

here ended the speaker i withdrew my eyes from the page but before i
had time to reflect on what i had read mr cambridge entered the
room he quickly perceived how i had been employed and betrayed some
solicitude respecting the condition of my mind

his fears however were superfluous what i had read threw me into a
state not easily described anguish and fury however had no part in
it my faculties were chained up in wonder and awe just then i was
unable to speak i looked at my friend with an air of inquisitiveness
and pointed at the roll he comprehended my inquiry and answered me
with looks of gloomy acquiescence after some time my thoughts found
their way to my lips

such then were the acts of my brother such were his words for this
he was condemned to die to die upon the gallows a fate cruel and
unmerited and is it so continued i struggling for utterance which
this new idea made difficult is he dead

no he is alive there could be no doubt as to the cause of these
excesses they originated in sudden madness but that madness continues
and he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment

madness say you are you sure were not these sights and these
sounds really seen and heard

my uncle was surprized at my question he looked at me with apparent
inquietude can you doubt said he that these were illusions does
heaven think you interfere for such ends

o no i think it not heaven cannot stimulate to such unheard-of
outrage the agent was not good but evil

nay my dear girl said my friend lay aside these fancies neither
angel nor devil had any part in this affair

you misunderstand me i answered i believe the agency to be external
and real but not supernatural

indeed said he in an accent of surprize whom do you then suppose
to be the agent

i know not all is wildering conjecture i cannot forget carwin i
cannot banish the suspicion that he was the setter of these snares but
how can we suppose it to be madness did insanity ever before assume
this form

frequently the illusion in this case was more dreadful in its
consequences than any that has come to my knowledge but i repeat that
similar illusions are not rare did you never hear of an instance which
occurred in your mother's family

no i beseech you relate it my grandfather's death i have understood
to have been extraordinary but i know not in what respect a brother
to whom he was much attached died in his youth and this as i have
heard influenced in some remarkable way the fate of my grandfather
but i am unacquainted with particulars

on the death of that brother resumed my friend my father was seized
with dejection which was found to flow from two sources he not only
grieved for the loss of a friend but entertained the belief that his
own death would be inevitably consequent on that of his brother he
waited from day to day in expectation of the stroke which he predicted
was speedily to fall upon him gradually however he recovered his
cheerfulness and confidence he married and performed his part in
the world with spirit and activity at the end of twenty-one years it
happened that he spent the summer with his family at an house which he
possessed on the sea coast in cornwall it was at no great distance
from a cliff which overhung the ocean and rose into the air to a great
height the summit was level and secure and easily ascended on the land
side the company frequently repaired hither in clear weather invited
by its pure airs and extensive prospects one evening in june my father
with his wife and some friends chanced to be on this spot every one
was happy and my father's imagination seemed particularly alive to the
grandeur of the scenery

suddenly however his limbs trembled and his features betrayed alarm
he threw himself into the attitude of one listening he gazed earnestly
in a direction in which nothing was visible to his friends this lasted
for a minute then turning to his companions he told them that his
brother had just delivered to him a summons which must be instantly
obeyed he then took an hasty and solemn leave of each person and
before their surprize would allow them to understand the scene he
rushed to the edge of the cliff threw himself headlong and was seen no
more

in the course of my practice in the german army many cases equally
remarkable have occurred unquestionably the illusions were maniacal
though the vulgar thought otherwise they are all reducible to one
class and are not more difficult of explication and cure than most
affections of our frame

this opinion my uncle endeavoured by various means to impress upon me
i listened to his reasonings and illustrations with silent respect my
astonishment was great on finding proofs of an influence of which i
had supposed there were no examples but i was far from accounting for
appearances in my uncle's manner ideas thronged into my mind which i
was unable to disjoin or to regulate i reflected that this madness
if madness it were had affected pleyel and myself as well as wieland
pleyel had heard a mysterious voice i had seen and heard a form had
showed itself to me as well as to wieland the disclosure had been
made in the same spot the appearance was equally complete and equally
prodigious in both instances whatever supposition i should adopt had
i not equal reason to tremble what was my security against influences
equally terrific and equally irresistable

it would be vain to attempt to describe the state of mind which this
idea produced i wondered at the change which a moment had affected
in my brother's condition now was i stupified with tenfold wonder in
contemplating myself was i not likewise transformed from rational and
human into a creature of nameless and fearful attributes was i not
transported to the brink of the same abyss ere a new day should come
my hands might be embrued in blood and my remaining life be consigned
to a dungeon and chains

with moral sensibility like mine no wonder that this new dread was more
insupportable than the anguish i had lately endured grief carries its
own antidote along with it when thought becomes merely a vehicle of
pain its progress must be stopped death is a cure which nature or
ourselves must administer to this cure i now looked forward with gloomy
satisfaction

my silence could not conceal from my uncle the state of my thoughts
he made unwearied efforts to divert my attention from views so
pregnant with danger his efforts aided by time were in some measure
successful confidence in the strength of my resolution and in the
healthful state of my faculties was once more revived i was able
to devote my thoughts to my brother's state and the causes of this
disasterous proceeding

my opinions were the sport of eternal change some times i conceived the
apparition to be more than human i had no grounds on which to build a
disbelief i could not deny faith to the evidence of my religion
the testimony of men was loud and unanimous both these concurred
to persuade me that evil spirits existed and that their energy was
frequently exerted in the system of the world

these ideas connected themselves with the image of carwin where is the
proof said i that daemons may not be subjected to the controul of men
this truth may be distorted and debased in the minds of the ignorant
the dogmas of the vulgar with regard to this subject are glaringly
absurd but though these may justly be neglected by the wise we are
scarcely justified in totally rejecting the possibility that men may
obtain supernatural aid

the dreams of superstition are worthy of contempt witchcraft its
instruments and miracles the compact ratified by a bloody signature
the apparatus of sulpherous smells and thundering explosions are
monstrous and chimerical these have no part in the scene over which the
genius of carwin presides that conscious beings dissimilar from human
but moral and voluntary agents as we are some where exist can scarcely
be denied that their aid may be employed to benign or malignant
purposes cannot be disproved

darkness rests upon the designs of this man the extent of his power is
unknown but is there not evidence that it has been now exerted

i recurred to my own experience here carwin had actually appeared upon
the stage but this was in a human character a voice and a form were
discovered but one was apparently exerted and the other disclosed not
to befriend but to counteract carwin's designs there were tokens of
hostility and not of alliance between them carwin was the miscreant
whose projects were resisted by a minister of heaven how can this be
reconciled to the stratagem which ruined my brother there the agency
was at once preternatural and malignant

the recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new channel the
malignity of that influence which governed my brother had hitherto been
no subject of doubt his wife and children were destroyed they had
expired in agony and fear yet was it indisputably certain that their
murderer was criminal he was acquitted at the tribunal of his own
conscience his behaviour at his trial and since was faithfully
reported to me appearances were uniform not for a moment did he lay
aside the majesty of virtue he repelled all invectives by appealing to
the deity and to the tenor of his past life surely there was truth in
this appeal none but a command from heaven could have swayed his will
and nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation could sustain his
mind in its present elevation

chapter xxi


such for some time was the course of my meditations my weakness and
my aversion to be pointed at as an object of surprize or compassion
prevented me from going into public i studiously avoided the visits of
those who came to express their sympathy or gratify their curiosity
my uncle was my principal companion nothing more powerfully tended to
console me than his conversation

with regard to pleyel my feelings seemed to have undergone a total
revolution it often happens that one passion supplants another late
disasters had rent my heart and now that the wound was in some degree
closed the love which i had cherished for this man seemed likewise to
have vanished

hitherto indeed i had had no cause for despair i was innocent of that
offence which had estranged him from my presence i might reasonably
expect that my innocence would at some time be irresistably
demonstrated and his affection for me be revived with his esteem now
my aversion to be thought culpable by him continued but was unattended
with the same impatience i desired the removal of his suspicions
not for the sake of regaining his love but because i delighted in the
veneration of so excellent a man and because he himself would derive
pleasure from conviction of my integrity

my uncle had early informed me that pleyel and he had seen each other
since the return of the latter from europe amidst the topics of their
conversation i discovered that pleyel had carefully omitted the mention
of those events which had drawn upon me so much abhorrence i could
not account for his silence on this subject perhaps time or some new
discovery had altered or shaken his opinion perhaps he was unwilling
though i were guilty to injure me in the opinion of my venerable
kinsman i understood that he had frequently visited me during
my disease had watched many successive nights by my bedside and
manifested the utmost anxiety on my account

the journey which he was preparing to take at the termination of our
last interview the catastrophe of the ensuing night induced him to
delay the motives of this journey i had till now totally mistaken
they were explained to me by my uncle whose tale excited my
astonishment without awakening my regret in a different state of mind
it would have added unspeakably to my distress but now it was more
a source of pleasure than pain this perhaps is not the least
extraordinary of the facts contained in this narrative it will excite
less wonder when i add that my indifference was temporary and that the
lapse of a few days shewed me that my feelings were deadened for a time
rather than finally extinguished

theresa de stolberg was alive she had conceived the resolution of
seeking her lover in america to conceal her flight she had caused the
report of her death to be propagated she put herself under the conduct
of bertrand the faithful servant of pleyel the pacquet which the
latter received from the hands of his servant contained the tidings of
her safe arrival at boston and to meet her there was the purpose of his
journey

this discovery had set this man's character in a new light i had
mistaken the heroism of friendship for the phrenzy of love he who
had gained my affections may be supposed to have previously entitled
himself to my reverence but the levity which had formerly characterized
the behaviour of this man tended to obscure the greatness of his
sentiments i did not fail to remark that since this lady was still
alive the voice in the temple which asserted her death must either
have been intended to deceive or have been itself deceived the latter
supposition was inconsistent with the notion of a spiritual and the
former with that of a benevolent being

when my disease abated pleyel had forborne his visits and had lately
set out upon this journey this amounted to a proof that my guilt was
still believed by him i was grieved for his errors but trusted that my
vindication would sooner or later be made

meanwhile tumultuous thoughts were again set afloat by a proposal
made to me by my uncle he imagined that new airs would restore my
languishing constitution and a varied succession of objects tend to
repair the shock which my mind had received for this end he proposed
to me to take up my abode with him in france or italy

at a more prosperous period this scheme would have pleased for its own
sake now my heart sickened at the prospect of nature the world of man
was shrowded in misery and blood and constituted a loathsome spectacle
i willingly closed my eyes in sleep and regretted that the respite it
afforded me was so short i marked with satisfaction the progress of
decay in my frame and consented to live merely in the hope that
the course of nature would speedily relieve me from the burthen
nevertheless as he persisted in his scheme i concurred in it merely
because he was entitled to my gratitude and because my refusal gave him
pain

no sooner was he informed of my consent than he told me i must make
immediate preparation to embark as the ship in which he had engaged
a passage would be ready to depart in three days this expedition was
unexpected there was an impatience in his manner when he urged the
necessity of dispatch that excited my surprize when i questioned him as
to the cause of this haste he generally stated reasons which at
that time i could not deny to be plausible but which on the review
appeared insufficient i suspected that the true motives were concealed
and believed that these motives had some connection with my brother's
destiny

i now recollected that the information respecting wieland which had
from time to time been imparted to me was always accompanied with airs
of reserve and mysteriousness what had appeared sufficiently explicit
at the time it was uttered i now remembered to have been faltering
and ambiguous i was resolved to remove my doubts by visiting the
unfortunate man in his dungeon

heretofore the idea of this visit had occurred to me but the horrors
of his dwelling-place his wild yet placid physiognomy his neglected
locks the fetters which constrained his limbs terrible as they were in
description how could i endure to behold

now however that i was preparing to take an everlasting farewell of my
country now that an ocean was henceforth to separate me from him how
could i part without an interview i would examine his situation with my
own eyes i would know whether the representations which had been made
to me were true perhaps the sight of the sister whom he was wont
to love with a passion more than fraternal might have an auspicious
influence on his malady

having formed this resolution i waited to communicate it to mr
cambridge i was aware that without his concurrence i could not hope
to carry it into execution and could discover no objection to which
it was liable if i had not been deceived as to his condition no
inconvenience could arise from this proceeding his consent therefore
would be the test of his sincerity

i seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head my suspicions
were confirmed by the manner in which my request affected him after
some pause in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity
he said to me why would you pay this visit what useful purpose can it
serve

we are preparing said i to leave the country forever what kind of
being should i be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even
a parting interview indulge me for three minutes in the sight of him
my heart will be much easier after i have looked at him and shed a few
tears in his presence

i believe otherwise the sight of him would only augment your distress
without contributing in any degree to his benefit

i know not that returned i surely the sympathy of his sister
proofs that her tenderness is as lively as ever must be a source
of satisfaction to him at present he must regard all mankind as his
enemies and calumniators his sister he probably conceives to partake
in the general infatuation and to join in the cry of abhorrence that
is raised against him to be undeceived in this respect to be assured
that however i may impute his conduct to delusion i still retain all
my former affection for his person and veneration for the purity of his
motives cannot but afford him pleasure when he hears that i have left
the country without even the ceremonious attention of a visit what
will he think of me his magnanimity may hinder him from repining but
he will surely consider my behaviour as savage and unfeeling indeed
dear sir i must pay this visit to embark with you without paying it
will be impossible it may be of no service to him but will enable me
to acquit myself of what i cannot but esteem a duty besides continued
i if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized him may not my
presence chance to have a salutary influence the mere sight of me it
is not impossible may rectify his perceptions

ay said my uncle with some eagerness it is by no means impossible
that your interview may have that effect and for that reason beyond
all others would i dissuade you from it

i expressed my surprize at this declaration is it not to be desired
that an error so fatal as this should be rectified

i wonder at your question reflect on the consequences of this error
has he not destroyed the wife whom he loved the children whom he
idolized what is it that enables him to bear the remembrance but the
belief that he acted as his duty enjoined would you rashly bereave him
of this belief would you restore him to himself and convince him
that he was instigated to this dreadful outrage by a perversion of his
organs or a delusion from hell

now his visions are joyous and elate he conceives himself to have
reached a loftier degree of virtue than any other human being the
merit of his sacrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of superior beings
by the detestation that pursues him here and the sufferings to which he
is condemned the belief that even his sister has deserted him and
gone over to his enemies adds to his sublimity of feelings and his
confidence in divine approbation and future recompense

let him be undeceived in this respect and what floods of despair and
of horror will overwhelm him instead of glowing approbation and serene
hope will he not hate and torture himself self-violence or a phrenzy
far more savage and destructive than this may be expected to succeed i
beseech you therefore to relinquish this scheme if you calmly reflect
upon it you will discover that your duty lies in carefully shunning
him

mr cambridge's reasonings suggested views to my understanding that had
not hitherto occurred i could not but admit their validity but they
shewed in a new light the depth of that misfortune in which my brother
was plunged i was silent and irresolute

presently i considered that whether wieland was a maniac a faithful
servant of his god the victim of hellish illusions or the dupe of
human imposture was by no means certain in this state of my mind it
became me to be silent during the visit that i projected this visit
should be brief i should be satisfied merely to snatch a look at him
admitting that a change in his opinions were not to be desired there
was no danger from the conduct which i should pursue that this change
should be wrought

but i could not conquer my uncle's aversion to this scheme yet i
persisted and he found that to make me voluntarily relinquish it it
was necessary to be more explicit than he had hitherto been he took
both my hands and anxiously examining my countenance as he spoke
clara said he this visit must not be paid we must hasten with the
utmost expedition from this shore it is folly to conceal the truth
from you and since it is only by disclosing the truth that you can be
prevailed upon to lay aside this project the truth shall be told

o my dear girl continued he with increasing energy in his accent
your brother's phrenzy is indeed stupendous and frightful the soul
that formerly actuated his frame has disappeared the same form remains
but the wise and benevolent wieland is no more a fury that is rapacious
of blood that lifts his strength almost above that of mortals that
bends all his energies to the destruction of whatever was once dear to
him possesses him wholly

you must not enter his dungeon his eyes will no sooner be fixed upon
you than an exertion of his force will be made he will shake off his
fetters in a moment and rush upon you no interposition will then be
strong or quick enough to save you

the phantom that has urged him to the murder of catharine and her
children is not yet appeased your life and that of pleyel are exacted
from him by this imaginary being he is eager to comply with this
demand twice he has escaped from his prison the first time he no
sooner found himself at liberty than he hasted to pleyel's house it
being midnight the latter was in bed wieland penetrated unobserved
to his chamber and opened his curtain happily pleyel awoke at the
critical moment and escaped the fury of his kinsman by leaping from
his chamber-window into the court happily he reached the ground
without injury alarms were given and after diligent search your
brother was found in a chamber of your house whither no doubt he
had sought you his chains and the watchfulness of his guards were
redoubled but again by some miracle he restored himself to liberty
he was now incautiously apprized of the place of your abode and had not
information of his escape been instantly given your death would have
been added to the number of his atrocious acts

you now see the danger of your project you must not only forbear to
visit him but if you would save him from the crime of embruing his
hands in your blood you must leave the country there is no hope that
his malady will end but with his life and no precaution will ensure
your safety but that of placing the ocean between you

i confess i came over with an intention to reside among you but
these disasters have changed my views your own safety and my happiness
require that you should accompany me in my return and i entreat you to
give your cheerful concurrence to this measure

after these representations from my uncle it was impossible to retain
my purpose i readily consented to seclude myself from wieland's
presence i likewise acquiesced in the proposal to go to europe not
that i ever expected to arrive there but because since my principles
forbad me to assail my own life change had some tendency to make
supportable the few days which disease should spare to me

what a tale had thus been unfolded i was hunted to death not by
one whom my misconduct had exasperated who was conscious of illicit
motives and who sought his end by circumvention and surprize but by
one who deemed himself commissioned for this act by heaven who
regarded this career of horror as the last refinement of virtue whose
implacability was proportioned to the reverence and love which he felt
for me and who was inaccessible to the fear of punishment and ignominy

in vain should i endeavour to stay his hand by urging the claims of
a sister or friend these were his only reasons for pursuing my
destruction had i been a stranger to his blood had i been the most
worthless of human kind my safety had not been endangered

surely said i my fate is without example the phrenzy which is charged
upon my brother must belong to myself my foe is manacled and guarded
but i derive no security from these restraints i live not in a
community of savages yet whether i sit or walk go into crouds
or hide myself in solitude my life is marked for a prey to inhuman
violence i am in perpetual danger of perishing of perishing under the
grasp of a brother

i recollected the omens of this destiny i remembered the gulf to which
my brother's invitation had conducted me i remembered that when on the
brink of danger the author of my peril was depicted by my fears in
his form thus realized were the creatures of prophetic sleep and of
wakeful terror

these images were unavoidably connected with that of carwin in
this paroxysm of distress my attention fastened on him as the grand
deceiver the author of this black conspiracy the intelligence that
governed in this storm

some relief is afforded in the midst of suffering when its author is
discovered or imagined and an object found on which we may pour out
our indignation and our vengeance i ran over the events that had taken
place since the origin of our intercourse with him and reflected on the
tenor of that description which was received from ludloe mixed up with
notions of supernatural agency were the vehement suspicions which i
entertained that carwin was the enemy whose machinations had destroyed
us

i thirsted for knowledge and for vengeance i regarded my hasty
departure with reluctance since it would remove me from the means by
which this knowledge might be obtained and this vengeance gratified
this departure was to take place in two days at the end of two days
i was to bid an eternal adieu to my native country should i not pay a
parting visit to the scene of these disasters should i not bedew with
my tears the graves of my sister and her children should i not explore
their desolate habitation and gather from the sight of its walls and
furniture food for my eternal melancholy

this suggestion was succeeded by a secret shuddering some disastrous
influence appeared to overhang the scene how many memorials should i
meet with serving to recall the images of those i had lost

i was tempted to relinquish my design when it occurred to me that i
had left among my papers a journal of transactions in shorthand i
was employed in this manuscript on that night when pleyel's incautious
curiosity tempted him to look over my shoulder i was then recording my
adventure in the recess an imperfect sight of which led him into such
fatal errors

i had regulated the disposition of all my property this manuscript
however which contained the most secret transactions of my life i was
desirous of destroying for this end i must return to my house and this
i immediately determined to do

i was not willing to expose myself to opposition from my friends
by mentioning my design i therefore bespoke the use of mr hallet's
chaise under pretence of enjoying an airing as the day was remarkably
bright

this request was gladly complied with and i directed the servant to
conduct me to mettingen i dismissed him at the gate intending to use
in returning a carriage belonging to my brother



chapter xxii


the inhabitants of the hut received me with a mixture of joy and
surprize their homely welcome and their artless sympathy were
grateful to my feelings in the midst of their inquiries as to my
health they avoided all allusions to the source of my malady they were
honest creatures and i loved them well i participated in the tears
which they shed when i mentioned to them my speedy departure for europe
and promised to acquaint them with my welfare during my long absence

they expressed great surprize when i informed them of my intention to
visit my cottage alarm and foreboding overspread their features and
they attempted to dissuade me from visiting an house which they firmly
believed to be haunted by a thousand ghastly apparitions

these apprehensions however had no power over my conduct i took an
irregular path which led me to my own house all was vacant and forlorn
a small enclosure near which the path led was the burying-ground
belonging to the family this i was obliged to pass once i had intended
to enter it and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions which my uncle
had caused to be made on the tombs of catharine and her children but
now my heart faltered as i approached and i hastened forward that
distance might conceal it from my view

when i approached the recess my heart again sunk i averted my eyes
and left it behind me as quickly as possible silence reigned through
my habitation and a darkness which closed doors and shutters produced
every object was connected with mine or my brother's history i passed
the entry mounted the stair and unlocked the door of my chamber
it was with difficulty that i curbed my fancy and smothered my fears
slight movements and casual sounds were transformed into beckoning
shadows and calling shapes

i proceeded to the closet i opened and looked round it with
fearfulness all things were in their accustomed order i sought and
found the manuscript where i was used to deposit it this being secured
there was nothing to detain me yet i stood and contemplated awhile the
furniture and walls of my chamber i remembered how long this apartment
had been a sweet and tranquil asylum i compared its former state with
its present dreariness and reflected that i now beheld it for the last
time

here it was that the incomprehensible behaviour of carwin was witnessed
this the stage on which that enemy of man shewed himself for a moment
unmasked here the menaces of murder were wafted to my ear and here
these menaces were executed

these thoughts had a tendency to take from me my self-command my feeble
limbs refused to support me and i sunk upon a chair incoherent and
half-articulate exclamations escaped my lips the name of carwin was
uttered and eternal woes woes like that which his malice had entailed
upon us were heaped upon him i invoked all-seeing heaven to drag to
light and to punish this betrayer and accused its providence for having
thus long delayed the retribution that was due to so enormous a guilt

i have said that the window shutters were closed a feeble light
however found entrance through the crevices a small window illuminated
the closet and the door being closed a dim ray streamed through
the key-hole a kind of twilight was thus created sufficient for the
purposes of vision but at the same time involving all minuter objects
in obscurity

this darkness suited the colour of my thoughts i sickened at the
remembrance of the past the prospect of the future excited my loathing
i muttered in a low voice why should i live longer why should i drag a
miserable being all for whom i ought to live have perished am i not
myself hunted to death

at that moment my despair suddenly became vigorous my nerves were no
longer unstrung my powers that had long been deadened were revived
my bosom swelled with a sudden energy and the conviction darted through
my mind that to end my torments was at once practicable and wise

i knew how to find way to the recesses of life i could use a lancet
with some skill and could distinguish between vein and artery by
piercing deep into the latter i should shun the evils which the future
had in store for me and take refuge from my woes in quiet death

i started on my feet for my feebleness was gone and hasted to the
closet a lancet and other small instruments were preserved in a
case which i had deposited here inattentive as i was to foreign
considerations my ears were still open to any sound of mysterious
import that should occur i thought i heard a step in the entry my
purpose was suspended and i cast an eager glance at my chamber door
which was open no one appeared unless the shadow which i discerned
upon the floor was the outline of a man if it were i was authorized
to suspect that some one was posted close to the entrance who possibly
had overheard my exclamations

my teeth chattered and a wild confusion took place of my momentary
calm thus it was when a terrific visage had disclosed itself on a
former night thus it was when the evil destiny of wieland assumed the
lineaments of something human what horrid apparition was preparing to
blast my sight

still i listened and gazed not long for the shadow moved a foot
unshapely and huge was thrust forward a form advanced from its
concealment and stalked into the room it was carwin while i had
breath i shrieked while i had power over my muscles i motioned with
my hand that he should vanish my exertions could not last long i sunk
into a fit

o that this grateful oblivion had lasted for ever too quickly i
recovered my senses the power of distinct vision was no sooner restored
to me than this hateful form again presented itself and i once more
relapsed

a second time untoward nature recalled me from the sleep of death
i found myself stretched upon the bed when i had power to look up i
remembered only that i had cause to fear my distempered fancy fashioned
to itself no distinguishable image i threw a languid glance round me
once more my eyes lighted upon carwin

he was seated on the floor his back rested against the wall his knees
were drawn up and his face was buried in his hands that his station
was at some distance that his attitude was not menacing that his
ominous visage was concealed may account for my now escaping a shock
violent as those which were past i withdrew my eyes but was not again
deserted by my senses

on perceiving that i had recovered my sensibility he lifted his head
this motion attracted my attention his countenance was mild but sorrow
and astonishment sat upon his features i averted my eyes and feebly
exclaimed o fly fly far and for ever i cannot behold you and
live

he did not rise upon his feet but clasped his hands and said in a
tone of deprecation i will fly i am become a fiend the sight of whom
destroys yet tell me my offence you have linked curses with my name
you ascribe to me a malice monstrous and infernal i look around all
is loneliness and desert this house and your brother's are solitary and
dismantled you die away at the sight of me my fear whispers that some
deed of horror has been perpetrated that i am the undesigning cause

what language was this had he not avowed himself a ravisher had not
this chamber witnessed his atrocious purposes i besought him with new
vehemence to go

he lifted his eyes great heaven what have i done i think i know
the extent of my offences i have acted but my actions have possibly
effected more than i designed this fear has brought me back from my
retreat i come to repair the evil of which my rashness was the cause
and to prevent more evil i come to confess my errors

wretch i cried when my suffocating emotions would permit me to speak
the ghosts of my sister and her children do they not rise to accuse
thee who was it that blasted the intellects of wieland who was it
that urged him to fury and guided him to murder who but thou and the
devil with whom thou art confederated

at these words a new spirit pervaded his countenance his eyes once more
appealed to heaven if i have memory if i have being i am innocent i
intended no ill but my folly indirectly and remotely may have caused
it but what words are these your brother lunatic his children dead

what should i infer from this deportment was the ignorance which these
words implied real or pretended yet how could i imagine a mere human
agency in these events but if the influence was preternatural or
maniacal in my brother's case they must be equally so in my own then
i remembered that the voice exerted was to save me from carwin's
attempts these ideas tended to abate my abhorrence of this man and to
detect the absurdity of my accusations

alas said i i have no one to accuse leave me to my fate fly from
a scene stained with cruelty devoted to despair

carwin stood for a time musing and mournful at length he said what
has happened i came to expiate my crimes let me know them in their
full extent i have horrible forebodings what has happened

i was silent but recollecting the intimation given by this man when he
was detected in my closet which implied some knowledge of that power
which interfered in my favor i eagerly inquired what was that voice
which called upon me to hold when i attempted to open the closet what
face was that which i saw at the bottom of the stairs answer me truly

i came to confess the truth your allusions are horrible and strange
perhaps i have but faint conceptions of the evils which my infatuation
has produced but what remains i will perform it was my voice that you
heard it was my face that you saw

for a moment i doubted whether my remembrance of events were not
confused how could he be at once stationed at my shoulder and shut up
in my closet how could he stand near me and yet be invisible but if
carwin's were the thrilling voice and the fiery visage which i had heard
and seen then was he the prompter of my brother and the author of
these dismal outrages

once more i averted my eyes and struggled for speech begone thou man
of mischief remorseless and implacable miscreant begone

i will obey said he in a disconsolate voice yet wretch as i am
am i unworthy to repair the evils that i have committed i came as a
repentant criminal it is you whom i have injured and at your bar am
i willing to appear and confess and expiate my crimes i have deceived
you i have sported with your terrors i have plotted to destroy your
reputation i come now to remove your errors to set you beyond the
reach of similar fears to rebuild your fame as far as i am able

this is the amount of my guilt and this the fruit of my remorse will
you not hear me listen to my confession and then denounce punishment
all i ask is a patient audience

what i replied was not thine the voice that commanded my brother to
imbrue his hands in the blood of his children to strangle that angel of
sweetness his wife has he not vowed my death and the death of pleyel
at thy bidding hast thou not made him the butcher of his family
changed him who was the glory of his species into worse than brute
robbed him of reason and consigned the rest of his days to fetters and
stripes

carwin's eyes glared and his limbs were petrified at this intelligence
no words were requisite to prove him guiltless of these enormities at
the time however i was nearly insensible to these exculpatory tokens
he walked to the farther end of the room and having recovered some
degree of composure he spoke 

i am not this villain i have slain no one i have prompted none to
slay i have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy without malignant
intentions but without caution ample will be the punishment of my
temerity if my conduct has contributed to this evil he paused 

i likewise was silent i struggled to command myself so far as to listen
to the tale which he should tell observing this he continued 

you are not apprized of the existence of a power which i possess i
know not by what name to call it it enables me to mimic exactly the
voice of another and to modify the sound so that it shall appear to
come from what quarter and be uttered at what distance i please

i know not that every one possesses this power perhaps though a
casual position of my organs in my youth shewed me that i possessed
it it is an art which may be taught to all would to god i had died
unknowing of the secret it has produced nothing but degradation and
calamity

for a time the possession of so potent and stupendous an endowment
elated me with pride unfortified by principle subjected to poverty
stimulated by headlong passions i made this powerful engine subservient
to the supply of my wants and the gratification of my vanity i shall
not mention how diligently i cultivated this gift which seemed capable
of unlimited improvement nor detail the various occasions on which
it was successfully exerted to lead superstition conquer avarice or
excite awe

i left america which is my native soil in my youth i have been
engaged in various scenes of life in which my peculiar talent has been
exercised with more or less success i was finally betrayed by one who
called himself my friend into acts which cannot be justified though
they are susceptible of apology

the perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw from europe i
returned to my native country uncertain whether silence and obscurity
would save me from his malice i resided in the purlieus of the city i
put on the garb and assumed the manners of a clown

my chief recreation was walking my principal haunts were the lawns
and gardens of mettingen in this delightful region the luxuriances
of nature had been chastened by judicious art and each successive
contemplation unfolded new enchantments

i was studious of seclusion i was satiated with the intercourse of
mankind and discretion required me to shun their intercourse for
these reasons i long avoided the observation of your family and chiefly
visited these precincts at night

i was never weary of admiring the position and ornaments of the
temple many a night have i passed under its roof revolving no pleasing
meditations when in my frequent rambles i perceived this apartment
was occupied i gave a different direction to my steps one evening
when a shower had just passed judging by the silence that no one
was within i ascended to this building glancing carelessly round i
perceived an open letter on the pedestal to read it was doubtless an
offence against politeness of this offence however i was guilty

scarcely had i gone half through when i was alarmed by the approach
of your brother to scramble down the cliff on the opposite side
was impracticable i was unprepared to meet a stranger besides
the aukwardness attending such an interview in these circumstances
concealment was necessary to my safety a thousand times had i vowed
never again to employ the dangerous talent which i possessed but such
was the force of habit and the influence of present convenience that i
used this method of arresting his progress and leading him back to the
house with his errand whatever it was unperformed i had often caught
parts from my station below of your conversation in this place and
was well acquainted with the voice of your sister

some weeks after this i was again quietly seated in this recess the
lateness of the hour secured me as i thought from all interruption
in this however i was mistaken for wieland and pleyel as i judged by
their voices earnest in dispute ascended the hill

i was not sensible that any inconvenience could possibly have flowed
from my former exertion yet it was followed with compunction because
it was a deviation from a path which i had assigned to myself now
my aversion to this means of escape was enforced by an unauthorized
curiosity and by the knowledge of a bushy hollow on the edge of the
hill where i should be safe from discovery into this hollow i thrust
myself

the propriety of removal to europe was the question eagerly discussed
pleyel intimated that his anxiety to go was augmented by the silence
of theresa de stolberg the temptation to interfere in this dispute was
irresistible in vain i contended with inveterate habits i disguised to
myself the impropriety of my conduct by recollecting the benefits which
it might produce pleyel's proposal was unwise yet it was enforced
with plausible arguments and indefatigable zeal your brother might be
puzzled and wearied but could not be convinced i conceived that
to terminate the controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a
benefit on all parties for this end i profited by an opening in the
conversation and assured them of catharine's irreconcilable aversion to
the scheme and of the death of the saxon baroness the latter event
was merely a conjecture but rendered extremely probable by pleyel's
representations my purpose you need not be told was effected

my passion for mystery and a species of imposture which i deemed
harmless was thus awakened afresh this second lapse into error made my
recovery more difficult i cannot convey to you an adequate idea of
the kind of gratification which i derived from these exploits yet i
meditated nothing my views were bounded to the passing moment and
commonly suggested by the momentary exigence

i must not conceal any thing your principles teach you to abhor a
voluptuous temper but with whatever reluctance i acknowledge this
temper to be mine you imagine your servant judith to be innocent as
well as beautiful but you took her from a family where hypocrisy as
well as licentiousness was wrought into a system my attention was
captivated by her charms and her principles were easily seen to be
flexible

deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduction your servant is not
destitute of feminine and virtuous qualities but she was taught that
the best use of her charms consists in the sale of them my nocturnal
visits to mettingen were now prompted by a double view and my
correspondence with your servant gave me at all times access to your
house

the second night after our interview so brief and so little foreseen
by either of us some daemon of mischief seized me according to my
companion's report your perfections were little less than divine her
uncouth but copious narratives converted you into an object of worship
she chiefly dwelt upon your courage because she herself was deficient
in that quality you held apparitions and goblins in contempt you took
no precautions against robbers you were just as tranquil and secure in
this lonely dwelling as if you were in the midst of a crowd hence a
vague project occurred to me to put this courage to the test a woman
capable of recollection in danger of warding off groundless panics
of discerning the true mode of proceeding and profiting by her best
resources is a prodigy i was desirous of ascertaining whether you were
such an one

my expedient was obvious and simple i was to counterfeit a murderous
dialogue but this was to be so conducted that another and not
yourself should appear to be the object i was not aware of the
possibility that you should appropriate these menaces to yourself had
you been still and listened you would have heard the struggles and
prayers of the victim who would likewise have appeared to be shut up in
the closet and whose voice would have been judith's this scene would
have been an appeal to your compassion and the proof of cowardice
or courage which i expected from you would have been your remaining
inactive in your bed or your entering the closet with a view to assist
the sufferer some instances which judith related of your fearlessness
and promptitude made me adopt the latter supposition with some degree of
confidence

by the girl's direction i found a ladder and mounted to your closet
window this is scarcely large enough to admit the head but it answered
my purpose too well

i cannot express my confusion and surprize at your abrupt and
precipitate flight i hastily removed the ladder and after some pause
curiosity and doubts of your safety induced me to follow you i found
you stretched on the turf before your brother's door without sense or
motion i felt the deepest regret at this unlooked-for consequence of
my scheme i knew not what to do to procure you relief the idea of
awakening the family naturally presented itself this emergency was
critical and there was no time to deliberate it was a sudden thought
that occurred i put my lips to the key-hole and sounded an alarm which
effectually roused the sleepers my organs were naturally forcible and
had been improved by long and assiduous exercise

long and bitterly did i repent of my scheme i was somewhat consoled by
reflecting that my purpose had not been evil and renewed my fruitless
vows never to attempt such dangerous experiments for some time i
adhered with laudable forbearance to this resolution

my life has been a life of hardship and exposure in the summer i
prefer to make my bed of the smooth turf or at most the shelter of a
summer-house suffices in all my rambles i never found a spot in which
so many picturesque beauties and rural delights were assembled as at
mettingen no corner of your little domain unites fragrance and secrecy
in so perfect a degree as the recess in the bank the odour of its
leaves the coolness of its shade and the music of its water-fall
had early attracted my attention here my sadness was converted into
peaceful melancholy here my slumbers were sound and my pleasures
enhanced

as most free from interruption i chose this as the scene of my
midnight interviews with judith one evening as the sun declined i was
seated here when i was alarmed by your approach it was with difficulty
that i effected my escape unnoticed by you

at the customary hour i returned to your habitation and was made
acquainted by judith with your unusual absence i half suspected the
true cause and felt uneasiness at the danger there was that i should be
deprived of my retreat or at least interrupted in the possession
of it the girl likewise informed me that among your other
singularities it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed and walk
forth for the sake of night-airs and starlight contemplations

i desired to prevent this inconvenience i found you easily swayed
by fear i was influenced in my choice of means by the facility and
certainty of that to which i had been accustomed all that i forsaw was
that in future this spot would be cautiously shunned by you

i entered the recess with the utmost caution and discovered by your
breathings in what condition you were the unexpected interpretation
which you placed upon my former proceeding suggested my conduct on
the present occasion the mode in which heaven is said by the poet to
interfere for the prevention of crimes was somewhat analogous to my
province and never failed to occur to me at seasons like this it
was requisite to break your slumbers and for this end i uttered the
powerful monosyllable hold hold my purpose was not prescribed by
duty yet surely it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable to
effect it i uttered what was false but it was well suited to my
purpose nothing less was intended than to injure you nay the evil
resulting from my former act was partly removed by assuring you that in
all places but this you were safe


 biloquium or ventrilocution sound is varied according to
 the variations of direction and distance the art of the
 ventriloquist consists in modifying his voice according to
 all these variations without changing his place see the
 work of the abbe de la chappelle in which are accurately
 recorded the performances of one of these artists and some
 ingenious though unsatisfactory speculations are given on
 the means by which the effects are produced this power is
 perhaps given by nature but is doubtless improvable if
 not acquirable by art it may possibly consist in an
 unusual flexibility or exertion of the bottom of the tongue
 and the uvula that speech is producible by these alone must
 be granted since anatomists mention two instances of
 persons speaking without a tongue in one case the organ
 was originally wanting but its place was supplied by a
 small tubercle and the uvula was perfect in the other the
 tongue was destroyed by disease but probably a small part
 of it remained

 this power is difficult to explain but the fact is
 undeniable experience shews that the human voice can
 imitate the voice of all men and of all inferior animals
 the sound of musical instruments and even noises from the
 contact of inanimate substances have been accurately
 imitated the mimicry of animals is notorious and dr
 burney musical travels mentions one who imitated a flute
 and violin so as to deceive even his ears

chapter xxiii


my morals will appear to you far from rigid yet my conduct will fall
short of your suspicions i am now to confess actions less excusable
and yet surely they will not entitle me to the name of a desperate or
sordid criminal

your house was rendered by your frequent and long absences easily
accessible to my curiosity my meeting with pleyel was the prelude to
direct intercourse with you i had seen much of the world but your
character exhibited a specimen of human powers that was wholly new to
me my intercourse with your servant furnished me with curious details
of your domestic management i was of a different sex i was not your
husband i was not even your friend yet my knowledge of you was of that
kind which conjugal intimacies can give and in some respects more
accurate the observation of your domestic was guided by me

you will not be surprized that i should sometimes profit by your
absence and adventure to examine with my own eyes the interior of your
chamber upright and sincere you used no watchfulness and practised
no precautions i scrutinized every thing and pried every where your
closet was usually locked but it was once my fortune to find the key on
a bureau i opened and found new scope for my curiosity in your books
one of these was manuscript and written in characters which essentially
agreed with a short-hand system which i had learned from a jesuit
missionary

i cannot justify my conduct yet my only crime was curiosity i
perused this volume with eagerness the intellect which it unveiled was
brighter than my limited and feeble organs could bear i was naturally
inquisitive as to your ideas respecting my deportment and the mysteries
that had lately occurred

you know what you have written you know that in this volume the key to
your inmost soul was contained if i had been a profound and malignant
impostor what plenteous materials were thus furnished me of stratagems
and plots

the coincidence of your dream in the summer-house with my exclamation
was truly wonderful the voice which warned you to forbear was
doubtless mine but mixed by a common process of the fancy with the
train of visionary incidents

i saw in a stronger light than ever the dangerousness of that
instrument which i employed and renewed my resolutions to abstain from
the use of it in future but i was destined perpetually to violate my
resolutions by some perverse fate i was led into circumstances in
which the exertion of my powers was the sole or the best means of
escape

on that memorable night on which our last interview took place i
came as usual to mettingen i was apprized of your engagement at your
brother's from which you did not expect to return till late some
incident suggested the design of visiting your chamber among your books
which i had not examined might be something tending to illustrate
your character or the history of your family some intimation had been
dropped by you in discourse respecting a performance of your father in
which some important transaction in his life was recorded

i was desirous of seeing this book and such was my habitual attachment
to mystery that i preferred the clandestine perusal of it such
were the motives that induced me to make this attempt judith had
disappeared and finding the house unoccupied i supplied myself with a
light and proceeded to your chamber

i found it easy on experiment to lock and unlock your closet door
without the aid of a key i shut myself in this recess and was busily
exploring your shelves when i heard some one enter the room below i
was at a loss who it could be whether you or your servant doubtful
however as i was i conceived it prudent to extinguish the light
scarcely was this done when some one entered the chamber the footsteps
were easily distinguished to be yours

my situation was now full of danger and perplexity for some time i
cherished the hope that you would leave the room so long as to afford
me an opportunity of escaping as the hours passed this hope gradually
deserted me it was plain that you had retired for the night

i knew not how soon you might find occasion to enter the closet i was
alive to all the horrors of detection and ruminated without ceasing on
the behaviour which it would be proper in case of detection to adopt
i was unable to discover any consistent method of accounting for my
being thus immured

it occurred to me that i might withdraw you from your chamber for a few
minutes by counterfeiting a voice from without some message from your
brother might be delivered requiring your presence at his house i was
deterred from this scheme by reflecting on the resolution i had formed
and on the possible evils that might result from it besides it was
not improbable that you would speedily retire to bed and then by the
exercise of sufficient caution i might hope to escape unobserved

meanwhile i listened with the deepest anxiety to every motion from
without i discovered nothing which betokened preparation for
sleep instead of this i heard deep-drawn sighs and occasionally an
half-expressed and mournful ejaculation hence i inferred that you were
unhappy the true state of your mind with regard to pleyel your own pen
had disclosed but i supposed you to be framed of such materials that
though a momentary sadness might affect you you were impregnable to any
permanent and heartfelt grief inquietude for my own safety was for a
moment suspended by sympathy with your distress

to the former consideration i was quickly recalled by a motion of yours
which indicated i knew not what i fostered the persuasion that you
would now retire to bed but presently you approached the closet and
detection seemed to be inevitable you put your hand upon the lock i
had formed no plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in which the
opening of the door would involve me i felt an irreconcilable aversion
to detection thus situated i involuntarily seized the door with a
resolution to resist your efforts to open it

suddenly you receded from the door this deportment was inexplicable
but the relief it afforded me was quickly gone you returned and i once
more was thrown into perplexity the expedient that suggested itself was
precipitate and inartificial i exerted my organs and called upon you to
hold

that you should persist in spite of this admonition was a subject of
astonishment i again resisted your efforts for the first expedient
having failed i knew not what other to resort to in this state how
was my astonishment increased when i heard your exclamations

it was now plain that you knew me to be within further resistance was
unavailing and useless the door opened and i shrunk backward seldom
have i felt deeper mortification and more painful perplexity i did
not consider that the truth would be less injurious than any lie which i
could hastily frame conscious as i was of a certain degree of guilt
i conceived that you would form the most odious suspicions the truth
would be imperfect unless i were likewise to explain the mysterious
admonition which had been given but that explanation was of too great
moment and involved too extensive consequences to make me suddenly
resolve to give it i was aware that this discovery would associate
itself in your mind with the dialogue formerly heard in this closet
thence would your suspicions be aggravated and to escape from these
suspicions would be impossible but the mere truth would be sufficiently
opprobrious and deprive me for ever of your good opinion

thus was i rendered desperate and my mind rapidly passed to the
contemplation of the use that might be made of previous events some
good genius would appear to you to have interposed to save you from
injury intended by me why i said since i must sink in her opinion
should i not cherish this belief why not personate an enemy and
pretend that celestial interference has frustrated my schemes i must
fly but let me leave wonder and fear behind me elucidation of the
mystery will always be practicable i shall do no injury but merely
talk of evil that was designed but is now past

thus i extenuated my conduct to myself but i scarcely expect that
this will be to you a sufficient explication of the scene that followed
those habits which i have imbibed the rooted passion which possesses me
for scattering around me amazement and fear you enjoy no opportunities
of knowing that a man should wantonly impute to himself the most
flagitious designs will hardly be credited even though you reflect
that my reputation was already by my own folly irretrievably ruined
and that it was always in my power to communicate the truth and rectify
the mistake

i left you to ponder on this scene my mind was full of rapid
and incongruous ideas compunction self-upbraiding hopelesness
satisfaction at the view of those effects likely to flow from my new
scheme misgivings as to the beneficial result of this scheme took
possession of my mind and seemed to struggle for the mastery

i had gone too far to recede i had painted myself to you as an
assassin and ravisher withheld from guilt only by a voice from heaven
i had thus reverted into the path of error and now having gone thus
far my progress seemed to be irrevocable i said to myself i must
leave these precincts for ever my acts have blasted my fame in the eyes
of the wielands for the sake of creating a mysterious dread i have
made myself a villain i may complete this mysterious plan by some new
imposture but i cannot aggravate my supposed guilt

my resolution was formed and i was swiftly ruminating on the means for
executing it when pleyel appeared in sight this incident decided my
conduct it was plain that pleyel was a devoted lover but he was at
the same time a man of cold resolves and exquisite sagacity to deceive
him would be the sweetest triumph i had ever enjoyed the deception
would be momentary but it would likewise be complete that his delusion
would so soon be rectified was a recommendation to my scheme for i
esteemed him too much to desire to entail upon him lasting agonies

i had no time to reflect further for he proceeded with a quick
step towards the house i was hurried onward involuntarily and by a
mechanical impulse i followed him as he passed the recess in the bank
and shrowding myself in that spot i counterfeited sounds which i knew
would arrest his steps

he stopped turned listened approached and overheard a dialogue
whose purpose was to vanquish his belief in a point where his belief
was most difficult to vanquish i exerted all my powers to imitate your
voice your general sentiments and your language being master
by means of your journal of your personal history and most secret
thoughts my efforts were the more successful when i reviewed the tenor
of this dialogue i cannot believe but that pleyel was deluded when i
think of your character and of the inferences which this dialogue was
intended to suggest it seems incredible that this delusion should be
produced

i spared not myself i called myself murderer thief guilty of
innumerable perjuries and misdeeds that you had debased yourself to the
level of such an one no evidence methought would suffice to convince
him who knew you so thoroughly as pleyel and yet the imposture
amounted to proof which the most jealous scrutiny would find to be
unexceptionable

he left his station precipitately and resumed his way to the house i
saw that the detection of his error would be instantaneous since not
having gone to bed an immediate interview would take place between
you at first this circumstance was considered with regret but as time
opened my eyes to the possible consequences of this scene i regarded it
with pleasure

in a short time the infatuation which had led me thus far began to
subside the remembrance of former reasonings and transactions was
renewed how often i had repented this kind of exertion how many evils
were produced by it which i had not foreseen what occasions for the
bitterest remorse it had administered now passed through my mind the
black catalogue of stratagems was now increased i had inspired you with
the most vehement terrors i had filled your mind with faith in shadows
and confidence in dreams i had depraved the imagination of pleyel
i had exhibited you to his understanding as devoted to brutal
gratifications and consummate in hypocrisy the evidence which
accompanied this delusion would be irresistible to one whose passion
had perverted his judgment whose jealousy with regard to me had already
been excited and who therefore would not fail to overrate the force
of this evidence what fatal act of despair or of vengeance might not
this error produce

with regard to myself i had acted with a phrenzy that surpassed
belief i had warred against my peace and my fame i had banished myself
from the fellowship of vigorous and pure minds i was self-expelled
from a scene which the munificence of nature had adorned with unrivalled
beauties and from haunts in which all the muses and humanities had
taken refuge

i was thus torn by conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets the night
passed away in this state of confusion and next morning in the gazette
left at my obscure lodging i read a description and an offer of reward
for the apprehension of my person i was said to have escaped from
an irish prison in which i was confined as an offender convicted of
enormous and complicated crimes

this was the work of an enemy who by falsehood and stratagem had
procured my condemnation i was indeed a prisoner but escaped by the
exertion of my powers the fate to which i was doomed but which i did
not deserve i had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhausted but
i now perceived that my precautions had been wise for that the
intervention of an ocean was insufficient for my security

let me not dwell on the sensations which this discovery produced i
need not tell by what steps i was induced to seek an interview with
you for the purpose of disclosing the truth and repairing as far as
possible the effects of my misconduct it was unavoidable that this
gazette would fall into your hands and that it would tend to confirm
every erroneous impression

having gained this interview i purposed to seek some retreat in the
wilderness inaccessible to your inquiry and to the malice of my foe
where i might henceforth employ myself in composing a faithful narrative
of my actions i designed it as my vindication from the aspersions that
had rested on my character and as a lesson to mankind on the evils of
credulity on the one hand and of imposture on the other

i wrote you a billet which was left at the house of your friend
and which i knew would by some means speedily come to your hands i
entertained a faint hope that my invitation would be complied with i
knew not what use you would make of the opportunity which this proposal
afforded you of procuring the seizure of my person but this fate i was
determined to avoid and i had no doubt but due circumspection and the
exercise of the faculty which i possessed would enable me to avoid it

i lurked through the day in the neighbourhood of mettingen i
approached your habitation at the appointed hour i entered it in
silence by a trap-door which led into the cellar this had formerly
been bolted on the inside but judith had at an early period in our
intercourse removed this impediment i ascended to the first floor but
met with no one nor any thing that indicated the presence of an human
being

i crept softly up stairs and at length perceived your chamber door
to be opened and a light to be within it was of moment to discover by
whom this light was accompanied i was sensible of the inconveniencies
to which my being discovered at your chamber door by any one within
would subject me i therefore called out in my own voice but so
modified that it should appear to ascend from the court below who is
in the chamber is it miss wieland

no answer was returned to this summons i listened but no motion could
be heard after a pause i repeated my call but no less ineffectually

i now approached nearer the door and adventured to look in a light
stood on the table but nothing human was discernible i entered
cautiously but all was solitude and stillness

i knew not what to conclude if the house were inhabited my call would
have been noticed yet some suspicion insinuated itself that silence was
studiously kept by persons who intended to surprize me my approach had
been wary and the silence that ensued my call had likewise preceded it
a circumstance that tended to dissipate my fears

at length it occurred to me that judith might possibly be in her own
room i turned my steps thither but she was not to be found i passed
into other rooms and was soon convinced that the house was totally
deserted i returned to your chamber agitated by vain surmises and
opposite conjectures the appointed hour had passed and i dismissed the
hope of an interview

in this state of things i determined to leave a few lines on your
toilet and prosecute my journey to the mountains scarcely had i taken
the pen when i laid it aside uncertain in what manner to address you
i rose from the table and walked across the floor a glance thrown upon
the bed acquainted me with a spectacle to which my conceptions of horror
had not yet reached

in the midst of shuddering and trepidation the signal of your presence
in the court below recalled me to myself the deed was newly done
i only was in the house what had lately happened justified any
suspicions however enormous it was plain that this catastrophe was
unknown to you i thought upon the wild commotion which the discovery
would awaken in your breast i found the confusion of my own thoughts
unconquerable and perceived that the end for which i sought an
interview was not now to be accomplished

in this state of things it was likewise expedient to conceal my being
within i put out the light and hurried down stairs to my unspeakable
surprize notwithstanding every motive to fear you lighted a candle and
proceeded to your chamber

i retired to that room below from which a door leads into the cellar
this door concealed me from your view as you passed i thought upon the
spectacle which was about to present itself in an exigence so
abrupt and so little foreseen i was again subjected to the empire
of mechanical and habitual impulses i dreaded the effects which this
shocking exhibition bursting on your unprepared senses might produce

thus actuated i stept swiftly to the door and thrusting my head
forward once more pronounced the mysterious interdiction at that
moment by some untoward fate your eyes were cast back and you saw
me in the very act of utterance i fled through the darksome avenue at
which i entered covered with the shame of this detection

with diligence stimulated by a thousand ineffable emotions i pursued
my intended journey i have a brother whose farm is situated in the
bosom of a fertile desert near the sources of the leheigh and thither
i now repaired



chapter xxiv


deeply did i ruminate on the occurrences that had just passed nothing
excited my wonder so much as the means by which you discovered my being
in the closet this discovery appeared to be made at the moment when you
attempted to open it how could you have otherwise remained so long in
the chamber apparently fearless and tranquil and yet having made
this discovery how could you persist in dragging me forth persist in
defiance of an interdiction so emphatical and solemn

but your sister's death was an event detestable and ominous she had
been the victim of the most dreadful species of assassination how in a
state like yours the murderous intention could be generated was wholly
inconceivable

i did not relinquish my design of confessing to you the part which i
had sustained in your family but i was willing to defer it till the
task which i had set myself was finished that being done i resumed the
resolution the motives to incite me to this continually acquired
force the more i revolved the events happening at mettingen the more
insupportable and ominous my terrors became my waking hours and my
sleep were vexed by dismal presages and frightful intimations

catharine was dead by violence surely my malignant stars had not made
me the cause of her death yet had i not rashly set in motion a machine
over whose progress i had no controul and which experience had shewn me
was infinite in power every day might add to the catalogue of horrors
of which this was the source and a seasonable disclosure of the truth
might prevent numberless ills

fraught with this conception i have turned my steps hither i find
your brother's house desolate the furniture removed and the walls
stained with damps your own is in the same situation your chamber is
dismantled and dark and you exhibit an image of incurable grief and of
rapid decay

i have uttered the truth this is the extent of my offences you tell
me an horrid tale of wieland being led to the destruction of his wife
and children by some mysterious agent you charge me with the guilt
of this agency but i repeat that the amount of my guilt has been truly
stated the perpetrator of catharine's death was unknown to me till now
nay it is still unknown to me

at that moment the closing of a door in the kitchen was distinctly
heard by us carwin started and paused there is some one coming i
must not be found here by my enemies and need not since my purpose is
answered

i had drunk in with the most vehement attention every word that he
had uttered i had no breath to interrupt his tale by interrogations
or comments the power that he spoke of was hitherto unknown to me its
existence was incredible it was susceptible of no direct proof

he owns that his were the voice and face which i heard and saw he
attempts to give an human explanation of these phantasms but it is
enough that he owns himself to be the agent his tale is a lie and his
nature devilish as he deceived me he likewise deceived my brother and
now do i behold the author of all our calamities

such were my thoughts when his pause allowed me to think i should have
bad him begone if the silence had not been interrupted but now i feared
no more for myself and the milkiness of my nature was curdled into
hatred and rancour some one was near and this enemy of god and
man might possibly be brought to justice i reflected not that the
preternatural power which he had hitherto exerted would avail to rescue
him from any toils in which his feet might be entangled meanwhile
looks and not words of menace and abhorrence were all that i could
bestow

he did not depart he seemed dubious whether by passing out of the
house or by remaining somewhat longer where he was he should most
endanger his safety his confusion increased when steps of one barefoot
were heard upon the stairs he threw anxious glances sometimes at the
closet sometimes at the window and sometimes at the chamber door yet
he was detained by some inexplicable fascination he stood as if rooted
to the spot

as to me my soul was bursting with detestation and revenge i had
no room for surmises and fears respecting him that approached it was
doubtless a human being and would befriend me so far as to aid me in
arresting this offender

the stranger quickly entered the room my eyes and the eyes of carwin
were at the same moment darted upon him a second glance was not
needed to inform us who he was his locks were tangled and fell
confusedly over his forehead and ears his shirt was of coarse stuff
and open at the neck and breast his coat was once of bright and fine
texture but now torn and tarnished with dust his feet his legs and
his arms were bare his features were the seat of a wild and tranquil
solemnity but his eyes bespoke inquietude and curiosity

he advanced with firm step and looking as in search of some one he saw
me and stopped he bent his sight on the floor and clenching his hands
appeared suddenly absorbed in meditation such were the figure and
deportment of wieland such in his fallen state were the aspect and
guise of my brother

carwin did not fail to recognize the visitant care for his own safety
was apparently swallowed up in the amazement which this spectacle
produced his station was conspicuous and he could not have escaped the
roving glances of wieland yet the latter seemed totally unconscious of
his presence

grief at this scene of ruin and blast was at first the only sentiment
of which i was conscious a fearful stillness ensued at length wieland
lifting his hands which were locked in each other to his breast
exclaimed father i thank thee this is thy guidance hither thou hast
led me that i might perform thy will yet let me not err let me hear
again thy messenger

he stood for a minute as if listening but recovering from his attitude
he continued it is not needed dastardly wretch thus eternally
questioning the behests of thy maker weak in resolution wayward in
faith

he advanced to me and after another pause resumed poor girl
a dismal fate has set its mark upon thee thy life is demanded as
a sacrifice prepare thee to die make not my office difficult by
fruitless opposition thy prayers might subdue stones but none but he
who enjoined my purpose can shake it

these words were a sufficient explication of the scene the nature of
his phrenzy as described by my uncle was remembered i who had sought
death was now thrilled with horror because it was near death in
this form death from the hand of a brother was thought upon with
undescribable repugnance

in a state thus verging upon madness my eye glanced upon carwin his
astonishment appeared to have struck him motionless and dumb my life
was in danger and my brother's hand was about to be embrued in my
blood i firmly believed that carwin's was the instigation i could
rescue me from this abhorred fate i could dissipate this tremendous
illusion i could save my brother from the perpetration of new horrors
by pointing out the devil who seduced him to hesitate a moment was
to perish these thoughts gave strength to my limbs and energy to my
accents i started on my feet o brother spare me spare thyself
there is thy betrayer he counterfeited the voice and face of an angel
for the purpose of destroying thee and me he has this moment confessed
it he is able to speak where he is not he is leagued with hell but
will not avow it yet he confesses that the agency was his

my brother turned slowly his eyes and fixed them upon carwin every
joint in the frame of the latter trembled his complexion was paler than
a ghost's his eye dared not meet that of wieland but wandered with an
air of distraction from one space to another

man said my brother in a voice totally unlike that which he had
used to me what art thou the charge has been made answer it
the visage the voice at the bottom of these stairs at the hour of
eleven to whom did they belong to thee

twice did carwin attempt to speak but his words died away upon his
lips my brother resumed in a tone of greater vehemence 

thou falterest faltering is ominous say yes or no one word will
suffice but beware of falsehood was it a stratagem of hell to
overthrow my family wast thou the agent

i now saw that the wrath which had been prepared for me was to be
heaped upon another the tale that i heard from him and his present
trepidations were abundant testimonies of his guilt but what if
wieland should be undeceived what if he shall find his acts to have
proceeded not from an heavenly prompter but from human treachery will
not his rage mount into whirlwind will not he tare limb from limb this
devoted wretch

instinctively i recoiled from this image but it gave place to another
carwin may be innocent but the impetuosity of his judge may misconstrue
his answers into a confession of guilt wieland knows not that
mysterious voices and appearances were likewise witnessed by me carwin
may be ignorant of those which misled my brother thus may his answers
unwarily betray himself to ruin

such might be the consequences of my frantic precipitation and these
it was necessary if possible to prevent i attempted to speak but
wieland turning suddenly upon me commanded silence in a tone furious
and terrible my lips closed and my tongue refused its office

what art thou he resumed addressing himself to carwin answer me
whose form whose voice was it thy contrivance answer me

the answer was now given but confusedly and scarcely articulated i
meant nothing i intended no ill if i understand if i do not mistake
you it is too true i did appear in the entry did speak the
contrivance was mine but 

these words were no sooner uttered than my brother ceased to wear the
same aspect his eyes were downcast he was motionless his respiration
became hoarse like that of a man in the agonies of death carwin seemed
unable to say more he might have easily escaped but the thought which
occupied him related to what was horrid and unintelligible in this
scene and not to his own danger

presently the faculties of wieland which for a time were chained
up were seized with restlessness and trembling he broke silence the
stoutest heart would have been appalled by the tone in which he spoke
he addressed himself to carwin

why art thou here who detains thee go and learn better i will meet
thee but it must be at the bar of thy maker there shall i bear witness
against thee

perceiving that carwin did not obey he continued dost thou wish me
to complete the catalogue by thy death thy life is a worthless thing
tempt me no more i am but a man and thy presence may awaken a fury
which may spurn my controul begone

carwin irresolute striving in vain for utterance his complexion
pallid as death his knees beating one against another slowly obeyed
the mandate and withdrew



chapter xxv


a few words more and i lay aside the pen for ever yet why should i not
relinquish it now all that i have said is preparatory to this scene
and my fingers tremulous and cold as my heart refuse any further
exertion this must not be let my last energies support me in the
finishing of this task then will i lay down my head in the lap of
death hushed will be all my murmurs in the sleep of the grave

every sentiment has perished in my bosom even friendship is extinct
your love for me has prompted me to this task but i would not have
complied if it had not been a luxury thus to feast upon my woes i have
justly calculated upon my remnant of strength when i lay down the pen
the taper of life will expire my existence will terminate with my tale

now that i was left alone with wieland the perils of my situation
presented themselves to my mind that this paroxysm should terminate in
havock and rage it was reasonable to predict the first suggestion of my
fears had been disproved by my experience carwin had acknowledged his
offences and yet had escaped the vengeance which i had harboured had
not been admitted by wieland and yet the evils which i had endured
compared with those inflicted on my brother were as nothing i thirsted
for his blood and was tormented with an insatiable appetite for his
destruction yet my brother was unmoved and had dismissed him in
safety surely thou wast more than man while i am sunk below the
beasts

did i place a right construction on the conduct of wieland was the
error that misled him so easily rectified were views so vivid and faith
so strenuous thus liable to fading and to change was there not reason
to doubt the accuracy of my perceptions with images like these was
my mind thronged till the deportment of my brother called away my
attention

i saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven then would he listen
and look back as if in expectation of some one's appearance thrice he
repeated these gesticulations and this inaudible prayer each time the
mist of confusion and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his
understanding i guessed at the meaning of these tokens the words
of carwin had shaken his belief and he was employed in summoning the
messenger who had formerly communed with him to attest the value of
those new doubts in vain the summons was repeated for his eye met
nothing but vacancy and not a sound saluted his ear

he walked to the bed gazed with eagerness at the pillow which had
sustained the head of the breathless catharine and then returned to
the place where i sat i had no power to lift my eyes to his face i was
dubious of his purpose this purpose might aim at my life

alas nothing but subjection to danger and exposure to temptation
can show us what we are by this test was i now tried and found to be
cowardly and rash men can deliberately untie the thread of life and of
this i had deemed myself capable yet now that i stood upon the brink
of fate that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart i
shuddered and betook myself to any means of escape however monstrous

can i bear to think can i endure to relate the outrage which my heart
meditated where were my means of safety resistance was vain not even
the energy of despair could set me on a level with that strength which
his terrific prompter had bestowed upon wieland terror enables us to
perform incredible feats but terror was not then the state of my mind
where then were my hopes of rescue

methinks it is too much i stand aside as it were from myself i
estimate my own deservings a hatred immortal and inexorable is my
due i listen to my own pleas and find them empty and false yes i
acknowledge that my guilt surpasses that of all mankind i confess that
the curses of a world and the frowns of a deity are inadequate to my
demerits is there a thing in the world worthy of infinite abhorrence
it is i what shall i say i was menaced as i thought with death and
to elude this evil my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer
in visiting my house i had made provision against the machinations of
carwin in a fold of my dress an open penknife was concealed this i
now seized and drew forth it lurked out of view but i now see that my
state of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother
had lifted his hand this instrument of my preservation would have been
plunged into his heart

o insupportable remembrance hide thee from my view for a time hide
it from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the stabbing of a
brother a brother thus supreme in misery thus towering in virtue

he was probably unconscious of my design but presently drew back
this interval was sufficient to restore me to myself the madness the
iniquity of that act which i had purposed rushed upon my apprehension
for a moment i was breathless with agony at the next moment i recovered
my strength and threw the knife with violence on the floor

the sound awoke my brother from his reverie he gazed alternately at me
and at the weapon with a movement equally solemn he stooped and took
it up he placed the blade in different positions scrutinizing it
accurately and maintaining at the same time a profound silence

again he looked at me but all that vehemence and loftiness of spirit
which had so lately characterized his features were flown fallen
muscles a forehead contracted into folds eyes dim with unbidden
drops and a ruefulness of aspect which no words can describe were now
visible

his looks touched into energy the same sympathies in me and i poured
forth a flood of tears this passion was quickly checked by fear which
had now no longer my own but his safety for their object i watched
his deportment in silence at length he spoke

sister said he in an accent mournful and mild i have acted poorly
my part in this world what thinkest thou shall i not do better in the
next

i could make no answer the mildness of his tone astonished and
encouraged me i continued to regard him with wistful and anxious looks

i think resumed he i will try my wife and my babes have gone
before happy wretches i have sent you to repose and ought not to
linger behind

these words had a meaning sufficiently intelligible i looked at the
open knife in his hand and shuddered but knew not how to prevent the
deed which i dreaded he quickly noticed my fears and comprehended
them stretching towards me his hand with an air of increasing
mildness take it said he fear not for thy own sake nor for mine
the cup is gone by and its transient inebriation is succeeded by the
soberness of truth

thou angel whom i was wont to worship fearest thou my sister for
thy life once it was the scope of my labours to destroy thee but i was
prompted to the deed by heaven such at least was my belief thinkest
thou that thy death was sought to gratify malevolence no i am pure
from all stain i believed that my god was my mover

neither thee nor myself have i cause to injure i have done my duty
and surely there is merit in having sacrificed to that all that is dear
to the heart of man if a devil has deceived me he came in the habit
of an angel if i erred it was not my judgment that deceived me but
my senses in thy sight being of beings i am still pure still will i
look for my reward in thy justice

did my ears truly report these sounds if i did not err my brother was
restored to just perceptions he knew himself to have been betrayed to
the murder of his wife and children to have been the victim of infernal
artifice yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives he
was not devoid of sorrow for this was written on his countenance but
his soul was tranquil and sublime

perhaps this was merely a transition of his former madness into a new
shape perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors
which he had perpetrated infatuated wretch that i was to set myself up
as a model by which to judge of my heroic brother my reason taught
me that his conclusions were right but conscious of the impotence of
reason over my own conduct conscious of my cowardly rashness and my
criminal despair i doubted whether any one could be stedfast and wise

such was my weakness that even in the midst of these thoughts my
mind glided into abhorrence of carwin and i uttered in a low voice o
carwin carwin what hast thou to answer for

my brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation clara
said he be thyself equity used to be a theme for thy eloquence
reduce its lessons to practice and be just to that unfortunate man the
instrument has done its work and i am satisfied

i thank thee my god for this last illumination my enemy is thine
also i deemed him to be man the man with whom i have often communed
but now thy goodness has unveiled to me his true nature as the
performer of thy behests he is my friend

my heart began now to misgive me his mournful aspect had gradually
yielded place to a serene brow a new soul appeared to actuate his
frame and his eyes to beam with preternatural lustre these symptoms
did not abate and he continued

clara i must not leave thee in doubt i know not what brought about
thy interview with the being whom thou callest carwin for a time i was
guilty of thy error and deduced from his incoherent confessions that i
had been made the victim of human malice he left us at my bidding and
i put up a prayer that my doubts should be removed thy eyes were shut
and thy ears sealed to the vision that answered my prayer

i was indeed deceived the form thou hast seen was the incarnation of
a daemon the visage and voice which urged me to the sacrifice of my
family were his now he personates a human form then he was invironed
with the lustre of heaven 

clara he continued advancing closer to me thy death must come
this minister is evil but he from whom his commission was received is
god submit then with all thy wonted resignation to a decree that cannot
be reversed or resisted mark the clock three minutes are allowed to
thee in which to call up thy fortitude and prepare thee for thy doom
there he stopped

even now when this scene exists only in memory when life and all its
functions have sunk into torpor my pulse throbs and my hairs uprise
my brows are knit as then and i gaze around me in distraction i was
unconquerably averse to death but death imminent and full of agony as
that which was threatened was nothing this was not the only or chief
inspirer of my fears

for him not for myself was my soul tormented i might die and no
crime surpassing the reach of mercy would pursue me to the presence
of my judge but my assassin would survive to contemplate his deed and
that assassin was wieland

wings to bear me beyond his reach i had not i could not vanish with a
thought the door was open but my murderer was interposed between
that and me of self-defence i was incapable the phrenzy that lately
prompted me to blood was gone my state was desperate my rescue was
impossible

the weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be borne my sight
became confused my limbs were seized with convulsion i spoke but my
words were half-formed 

spare me my brother look down righteous judge snatch me from this
fate take away this fury from him or turn it elsewhere

such was the agony of my thoughts that i noticed not steps entering my
apartment supplicating eyes were cast upward but when my prayer was
breathed i once more wildly gazed at the door a form met my sight i
shuddered as if the god whom i invoked were present it was carwin that
again intruded and who stood before me erect in attitude and stedfast
in look the sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts his recent
tale was remembered his magical transitions and mysterious energy of
voice whether he were infernal or miraculous or human there was no
power and no need to decide whether the contriver or not of this spell
he was able to unbind it and to check the fury of my brother he had
ascribed to himself intentions not malignant here now was afforded a
test of his truth let him interpose as from above revoke the
savage decree which the madness of wieland has assigned to heaven and
extinguish for ever this passion for blood

my mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety the recommendations
it possessed thronged as it were together and made but one impression
on my intellect remoter effects and collateral dangers i saw not
perhaps the pause of an instant had sufficed to call them up the
improbability that the influence which governed wieland was external or
human the tendency of this stratagem to sanction so fatal an error or
substitute a more destructive rage in place of this the sufficiency of
carwin's mere muscular forces to counteract the efforts and restrain
the fury of wieland might at a second glance have been discovered
but no second glance was allowed my first thought hurried me to action
and fixing my eyes upon carwin i exclaimed 

o wretch once more hast thou come let it be to abjure thy malice to
counterwork this hellish stratagem to turn from me and from my brother
this desolating rage

testify thy innocence or thy remorse exert the powers which pertain to
thee whatever they be to turn aside this ruin thou art the author
of these horrors what have i done to deserve thus to die how have i
merited this unrelenting persecution i adjure thee by that god whose
voice thou hast dared to counterfeit to save my life

wilt thou then go leave me succourless

carwin listened to my intreaties unmoved and turned from me he seemed
to hesitate a moment then glided through the door rage and despair
stifled my utterance the interval of respite was passed the pangs
reserved for me by wieland were not to be endured my thoughts rushed
again into anarchy having received the knife from his hand i held it
loosely and without regard but now it seized again my attention and i
grasped it with force

he seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of carwin my gesture and
the murderous weapon appeared to have escaped his notice his silence
was unbroken his eye fixed upon the clock for a time was now
withdrawn fury kindled in every feature all that was human in his face
gave way to an expression supernatural and tremendous i felt my left
arm within his grasp 

even now i hesitated to strike i shrunk from his assault but in
vain 

here let me desist why should i rescue this event from oblivion why
should i paint this detestable conflict why not terminate at once this
series of horrors hurry to the verge of the precipice and cast myself
for ever beyond remembrance and beyond hope

still i live with this load upon my breast with this phantom to pursue
my steps with adders lodged in my bosom and stinging me to madness
still i consent to live

yes i will rise above the sphere of mortal passions i will spurn at
the cowardly remorse that bids me seek impunity in silence or comfort
in forgetfulness my nerves shall be new strung to the task have i not
resolved i will die the gulph before me is inevitable and near i will
die but then only when my tale is at an end



chapter xxvi


my right hand grasping the unseen knife was still disengaged it was
lifted to strike all my strength was exhausted but what was sufficient
to the performance of this deed already was the energy awakened
and the impulse given that should bear the fatal steel to his heart
when wieland shrunk back his hand was withdrawn breathless with
affright and desperation i stood freed from his grasp unassailed
untouched

thus long had the power which controuled the scene forborne to
interfere but now his might was irresistible and wieland in a moment
was disarmed of all his purposes a voice louder than human organs
could produce shriller than language can depict burst from the
ceiling and commanded him to hold

trouble and dismay succeeded to the stedfastness that had lately been
displayed in the looks of wieland his eyes roved from one quarter to
another with an expression of doubt he seemed to wait for a further
intimation

carwin's agency was here easily recognized i had besought him to
interpose in my defence he had flown i had imagined him deaf to my
prayer and resolute to see me perish yet he disappeared merely to
devise and execute the means of my relief

why did he not forbear when this end was accomplished why did his
misjudging zeal and accursed precipitation overpass that limit or meant
he thus to crown the scene and conduct his inscrutable plots to this
consummation

such ideas were the fruit of subsequent contemplation this moment
was pregnant with fate i had no power to reason in the career of my
tempestuous thoughts rent into pieces as my mind was by accumulating
horrors carwin was unseen and unsuspected i partook of wieland's
credulity shook with his amazement and panted with his awe

silence took place for a moment so much as allowed the attention to
recover its post then new sounds were uttered from above

man of errors cease to cherish thy delusion not heaven or hell but
thy senses have misled thee to commit these acts shake off thy phrenzy
and ascend into rational and human be lunatic no longer

my brother opened his lips to speak his tone was terrific and faint he
muttered an appeal to heaven it was difficult to comprehend the theme
of his inquiries they implied doubt as to the nature of the impulse
that hitherto had guided him and questioned whether he had acted in
consequence of insane perceptions

to these interrogatories the voice which now seemed to hover at his
shoulder loudly answered in the affirmative then uninterrupted silence
ensued

fallen from his lofty and heroic station now finally restored to the
perception of truth weighed to earth by the recollection of his own
deeds consoled no longer by a consciousness of rectitude for the
loss of offspring and wife a loss for which he was indebted to his own
misguided hand wieland was transformed at once into the man of sorrows

he reflected not that credit should be as reasonably denied to the last
as to any former intimation that one might as justly be ascribed to
erring or diseased senses as the other he saw not that this discovery
in no degree affected the integrity of his conduct that his motives had
lost none of their claims to the homage of mankind that the preference
of supreme good and the boundless energy of duty were undiminished in
his bosom

it is not for me to pursue him through the ghastly changes of his
countenance words he had none now he sat upon the floor motionless in
all his limbs with his eyes glazed and fixed a monument of woe

anon a spirit of tempestuous but undesigning activity seized him
he rose from his place and strode across the floor tottering and at
random his eyes were without moisture and gleamed with the fire
that consumed his vitals the muscles of his face were agitated by
convulsion his lips moved but no sound escaped him

that nature should long sustain this conflict was not to be believed
my state was little different from that of my brother i entered as it
were into his thought my heart was visited and rent by his pangs oh
that thy phrenzy had never been cured that thy madness with its
blissful visions would return or if that must not be that thy scene
would hasten to a close that death would cover thee with his oblivion

what can i wish for thee thou who hast vied with the great preacher
of thy faith in sanctity of motives and in elevation above sensual and
selfish thou whom thy fate has changed into paricide and savage can i
wish for the continuance of thy being no

for a time his movements seemed destitute of purpose if he walked if
he turned if his fingers were entwined with each other if his hands
were pressed against opposite sides of his head with a force
sufficient to crush it into pieces it was to tear his mind from
self-contemplation to waste his thoughts on external objects

speedily this train was broken a beam appeared to be darted into his
mind which gave a purpose to his efforts an avenue to escape presented
itself and now he eagerly gazed about him when my thoughts became
engaged by his demeanour my fingers were stretched as by a mechanical
force and the knife no longer heeded or of use escaped from my grasp
and fell unperceived on the floor his eye now lighted upon it he
seized it with the quickness of thought

i shrieked aloud but it was too late he plunged it to the hilt in his
neck and his life instantly escaped with the stream that gushed from
the wound he was stretched at my feet and my hands were sprinkled with
his blood as he fell

such was thy last deed my brother for a spectacle like this was it
my fate to be reserved thy eyes were closed thy face ghastly with
death thy arms and the spot where thou liedest floated in thy life's
blood these images have not for a moment forsaken me till i am
breathless and cold they must continue to hover in my sight

carwin as i said had left the room but he still lingered in the
house my voice summoned him to my aid but i scarcely noticed his
re-entrance and now faintly recollect his terrified looks his broken
exclamations his vehement avowals of innocence the effusions of his
pity for me and his offers of assistance

i did not listen i answered him not i ceased to upbraid or accuse his
guilt was a point to which i was indifferent ruffian or devil black
as hell or bright as angels thenceforth he was nothing to me i was
incapable of sparing a look or a thought from the ruin that was spread
at my feet

when he left me i was scarcely conscious of any variation in the scene
he informed the inhabitants of the hut of what had passed and they flew
to the spot careless of his own safety he hasted to the city to inform
my friends of my condition

my uncle speedily arrived at the house the body of wieland was removed
from my presence and they supposed that i would follow it but no my
home is ascertained here i have taken up my rest and never will i go
hence till like wieland i am borne to my grave

importunity was tried in vain they threatened to remove me by
violence nay violence was used but my soul prizes too dearly this
little roof to endure to be bereaved of it force should not
prevail when the hoary locks and supplicating tears of my uncle were
ineffectual my repugnance to move gave birth to ferociousness and
phrenzy when force was employed and they were obliged to consent to my
return

they besought me they remonstrated they appealed to every duty that
connected me with him that made me and with my fellow-men in vain
while i live i will not go hence have i not fulfilled my destiny

why will ye torment me with your reasonings and reproofs can ye restore
to me the hope of my better days can ye give me back catharine and her
babes can ye recall to life him who died at my feet

i will eat i will drink i will lie down and rise up at your
bidding all i ask is the choice of my abode what is there unreasonable
in this demand shortly will i be at peace this is the spot which i
have chosen in which to breathe my last sigh deny me not i beseech
you so slight a boon

talk not to me o my revered friend of carwin he has told thee his
tale and thou exculpatest him from all direct concern in the fate of
wieland this scene of havock was produced by an illusion of the senses
be it so i care not from what source these disasters have flowed it
suffices that they have swallowed up our hopes and our existence

what his agency began his agency conducted to a close he intended by
the final effort of his power to rescue me and to banish his illusions
from my brother such is his tale concerning the truth of which i care
not henceforth i foster but one wish i ask only quick deliverance from
life and all the ills that attend it 

go wretch torment me not with thy presence and thy prayers forgive
thee will that avail thee when thy fateful hour shall arrive be thou
acquitted at thy own tribunal and thou needest not fear the verdict
of others if thy guilt be capable of blacker hues if hitherto thy
conscience be without stain thy crime will be made more flagrant by
thus violating my retreat take thyself away from my sight if thou
wouldest not behold my death

thou are gone murmuring and reluctant and now my repose is coming my
work is done



chapter xxvii


written three years after the foregoing and dated at montpellier


i imagined that i had forever laid aside the pen and that i should
take up my abode in this part of the world was of all events the least
probable my destiny i believed to be accomplished and i looked forward
to a speedy termination of my life with the fullest confidence

surely i had reason to be weary of existence to be impatient of every
tie which held me from the grave i experienced this impatience in its
fullest extent i was not only enamoured of death but conceived from
the condition of my frame that to shun it was impossible even though
i had ardently desired it yet here am i a thousand leagues from my
native soil in full possession of life and of health and not destitute
of happiness

such is man time will obliterate the deepest impressions grief the
most vehement and hopeless will gradually decay and wear itself out
arguments may be employed in vain every moral prescription may be
ineffectually tried remonstrances however cogent or pathetic shall
have no power over the attention or shall be repelled with disdain
yet as day follows day the turbulence of our emotions shall subside
and our fluctuations be finally succeeded by a calm

perhaps however the conquest of despair was chiefly owing to an
accident which rendered my continuance in my own house impossible at
the conclusion of my long and as i then supposed my last letter to
you i mentioned my resolution to wait for death in the very spot which
had been the principal scene of my misfortunes from this resolution my
friends exerted themselves with the utmost zeal and perseverance to make
me depart they justly imagined that to be thus surrounded by memorials
of the fate of my family would tend to foster my disease a swift
succession of new objects and the exclusion of every thing calculated
to remind me of my loss was the only method of cure

i refused to listen to their exhortations great as my calamity was to
be torn from this asylum was regarded by me as an aggravation of it by
a perverse constitution of mind he was considered as my greatest enemy
who sought to withdraw me from a scene which supplied eternal food to my
melancholy and kept my despair from languishing

in relating the history of these disasters i derived a similar species
of gratification my uncle earnestly dissuaded me from this task but
his remonstrances were as fruitless on this head as they had been on
others they would have withheld from me the implements of writing but
they quickly perceived that to withstand would be more injurious than
to comply with my wishes having finished my tale it seemed as if the
scene were closing a fever lurked in my veins and my strength was
gone any exertion however slight was attended with difficulty and
at length i refused to rise from my bed

i now see the infatuation and injustice of my conduct in its true
colours i reflect upon the sensations and reasonings of that period
with wonder and humiliation that i should be insensible to the claims
and tears of my friends that i should overlook the suggestions of duty
and fly from that post in which only i could be instrumental to the
benefit of others that the exercise of the social and beneficent
affections the contemplation of nature and the acquisition of wisdom
should not be seen to be means of happiness still within my reach is
at this time scarcely credible

it is true that i am now changed but i have not the consolation to
reflect that my change was owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for
instruction better thoughts grew up in my mind imperceptibly i cannot
but congratulate myself on the change though perhaps it merely argues
a fickleness of temper and a defect of sensibility

after my narrative was ended i betook myself to my bed in the full
belief that my career in this world was on the point of finishing my
uncle took up his abode with me and performed for me every office of
nurse physician and friend one night after some hours of restlessness
and pain i sunk into deep sleep its tranquillity however was of no
long duration my fancy became suddenly distempered and my brain was
turned into a theatre of uproar and confusion it would not be easy to
describe the wild and phantastical incongruities that pestered me
my uncle wieland pleyel and carwin were successively and momently
discerned amidst the storm sometimes i was swallowed up by whirlpools
or caught up in the air by half-seen and gigantic forms and thrown upon
pointed rocks or cast among the billows sometimes gleams of light
were shot into a dark abyss on the verge of which i was standing and
enabled me to discover for a moment its enormous depth and hideous
precipices anon i was transported to some ridge of aetna and made a
terrified spectator of its fiery torrents and its pillars of smoke

however strange it may seem i was conscious even during my dream of
my real situation i knew myself to be asleep and struggled to break
the spell by muscular exertions these did not avail and i continued
to suffer these abortive creations till a loud voice at my bed side
and some one shaking me with violence put an end to my reverie my eyes
were unsealed and i started from my pillow

my chamber was filled with smoke which though in some degree luminous
would permit me to see nothing and by which i was nearly suffocated
the crackling of flames and the deafening clamour of voices without
burst upon my ears stunned as i was by this hubbub scorched with heat
and nearly choaked by the accumulating vapours i was unable to think or
act for my own preservation i was incapable indeed of comprehending
my danger

i was caught up in an instant by a pair of sinewy arms borne to the
window and carried down a ladder which had been placed there my
uncle stood at the bottom and received me i was not fully aware of my
situation till i found myself sheltered in the hut and surrounded by
its inhabitants

by neglect of the servant some unextinguished embers had been placed in
a barrel in the cellar of the building the barrel had caught fire
this was communicated to the beams of the lower floor and thence to the
upper part of the structure it was first discovered by some persons
at a distance who hastened to the spot and alarmed my uncle and the
servants the flames had already made considerable progress and my
condition was overlooked till my escape was rendered nearly impossible

my danger being known and a ladder quickly procured one of the
spectators ascended to my chamber and effected my deliverance in the
manner before related

this incident disastrous as it may at first seem had in reality a
beneficial effect upon my feelings i was in some degree roused from
the stupor which had seized my faculties the monotonous and gloomy
series of my thoughts was broken my habitation was levelled with the
ground and i was obliged to seek a new one a new train of images
disconnected with the fate of my family forced itself on my attention
and a belief insensibly sprung up that tranquillity if not happiness
was still within my reach notwithstanding the shocks which my frame had
endured the anguish of my thoughts no sooner abated than i recovered my
health

i now willingly listened to my uncle's solicitations to be the companion
of his voyage preparations were easily made and after a tedious
passage we set our feet on the shore of the ancient world the memory
of the past did not forsake me but the melancholy which it generated
and the tears with which it filled my eyes were not unprofitable my
curiosity was revived and i contemplated with ardour the spectacle of
living manners and the monuments of past ages

in proportion as my heart was reinstated in the possession of its
ancient tranquillity the sentiment which i had cherished with regard to
pleyel returned in a short time he was united to the saxon woman
and made his residence in the neighbourhood of boston i was glad that
circumstances would not permit an interview to take place between us i
could not desire their misery but i reaped no pleasure from reflecting
on their happiness time and the exertions of my fortitude cured me
in some degree of this folly i continued to love him but my passion
was disguised to myself i considered it merely as a more tender species
of friendship and cherished it without compunction

through my uncle's exertions a meeting was brought about between carwin
and pleyel and explanations took place which restored me at once to
the good opinion of the latter though separated so widely our
correspondence was punctual and frequent and paved the way for that
union which can only end with the death of one of us

in my letters to him i made no secret of my former sentiments this
was a theme on which i could talk without painful though not without
delicate emotions that knowledge which i should never have imparted to
a lover i felt little scruple to communicate to a friend

a year and an half elapsed when theresa was snatched from him by death
in the hour in which she gave him the first pledge of their mutual
affection this event was borne by him with his customary fortitude it
induced him however to make a change in his plans he disposed of his
property in america and joined my uncle and me who had terminated
the wanderings of two years at montpellier which will henceforth i
believe be our permanent abode

if you reflect upon that entire confidence which had subsisted from our
infancy between pleyel and myself on the passion that i had contracted
and which was merely smothered for a time and on the esteem which was
mutual you will not perhaps be surprized that the renovation of our
intercourse should give birth to that union which at present subsists
when the period had elapsed necessary to weaken the remembrance of
theresa to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor than of love
he tendered his affections to me i need not add that the tender was
eagerly accepted

perhaps you are somewhat interested in the fate of carwin he saw
when too late the danger of imposture so much affected was he by the
catastrophe to which he was a witness that he laid aside all regard to
his own safety he sought my uncle and confided to him the tale which
he had just related to me he found a more impartial and indulgent
auditor in mr cambridge who imputed to maniacal illusion the conduct
of wieland though he conceived the previous and unseen agency of
carwin to have indirectly but powerfully predisposed to this deplorable
perversion of mind

it was easy for carwin to elude the persecutions of ludloe it was
merely requisite to hide himself in a remote district of pennsylvania
this when he parted from us he determined to do he is now probably
engaged in the harmless pursuits of agriculture and may come to think
without insupportable remorse on the evils to which his fatal talents
have given birth the innocence and usefulness of his future life may
in some degree atone for the miseries so rashly or so thoughtlessly
inflicted

more urgent considerations hindered me from mentioning in the course of
my former mournful recital any particulars respecting the unfortunate
father of louisa conway that man surely was reserved to be a monument
of capricious fortune his southern journies being finished he returned
to philadelphia before he reached the city he left the highway and
alighted at my brother's door contrary to his expectation no one came
forth to welcome him or hail his approach he attempted to enter the
house but bolted doors barred windows and a silence broken only by
unanswered calls shewed him that the mansion was deserted

he proceeded thence to my habitation which he found in like manner
gloomy and tenantless his surprize may be easily conceived the rustics
who occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incredible tale he
hasted to the city and extorted from mrs baynton a full disclosure of
late disasters

he was inured to adversity and recovered after no long time from
the shocks produced by this disappointment of his darling scheme our
intercourse did not terminate with his departure from america we have
since met with him in france and light has at length been thrown upon
the motives which occasioned the disappearance of his wife in the
manner which i formerly related to you

i have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal attachment and mentioned
that no suspicion had ever glanced upon her purity this though
the belief was long cherished recent discoveries have shewn to be
questionable no doubt her integrity would have survived to the present
moment if an extraordinary fate had not befallen her

major stuart had been engaged while in germany in a contest of
honor with an aid de camp of the marquis of granby his adversary had
propagated a rumour injurious to his character a challenge was sent
a meeting ensued and stuart wounded and disarmed the calumniator the
offence was atoned for and his life secured by suitable concessions

maxwell that was his name shortly after in consequence of succeeding
to a rich inheritance sold his commission and returned to london his
fortune was speedily augmented by an opulent marriage interest was his
sole inducement to this marriage though the lady had been swayed by a
credulous affection the true state of his heart was quickly discovered
and a separation by mutual consent took place the lady withdrew to
an estate in a distant county and maxwell continued to consume his time
and fortune in the dissipation of the capital

maxwell though deceitful and sensual possessed great force of mind and
specious accomplishments he contrived to mislead the generous mind of
stuart and to regain the esteem which his misconduct for a time had
forfeited he was recommended by her husband to the confidence of mrs
stuart maxwell was stimulated by revenge and by a lawless passion to
convert this confidence into a source of guilt

the education and capacity of this woman the worth of her husband the
pledge of their alliance which time had produced her maturity in
age and knowledge of the world all combined to render this attempt
hopeless maxwell however was not easily discouraged the most perfect
being he believed must owe his exemption from vice to the absence of
temptation the impulses of love are so subtile and the influence of
false reasoning when enforced by eloquence and passion so unbounded
that no human virtue is secure from degeneracy all arts being tried
every temptation being summoned to his aid dissimulation being carried
to its utmost bound maxwell at length nearly accomplished his
purpose the lady's affections were withdrawn from her husband and
transferred to him she could not as yet be reconciled to dishonor
all efforts to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual she
permitted herself to love and to avow her love but at this limit she
stopped and was immoveable

hence this revolution in her sentiments was productive only of despair
her rectitude of principle preserved her from actual guilt but could
not restore to her her ancient affection or save her from being the
prey of remorseful and impracticable wishes her husband's absence
produced a state of suspense this however approached to a period
and she received tidings of his intended return maxwell being likewise
apprized of this event and having made a last and unsuccessful effort
to conquer her reluctance to accompany him in a journey to italy
whither he pretended an invincible necessity of going left her to
pursue the measures which despair might suggest at the same time she
received a letter from the wife of maxwell unveiling the true character
of this man and revealing facts which the artifices of her seducer
had hitherto concealed from her mrs maxwell had been prompted to this
disclosure by a knowledge of her husband's practices with which his own
impetuosity had made her acquainted

this discovery joined to the delicacy of her scruples and the anguish
of remorse induced her to abscond this scheme was adopted in haste
but effected with consummate prudence she fled on the eve of her
husband's arrival in the disguise of a boy and embarked at falmouth in
a packet bound for america

the history of her disastrous intercourse with maxwell the motives
inducing her to forsake her country and the measures she had taken
to effect her design were related to mrs maxwell in reply to her
communication between these women an ancient intimacy and considerable
similitude of character subsisted this disclosure was accompanied with
solemn injunctions of secrecy and these injunctions were for a long
time faithfully observed

mrs maxwell's abode was situated on the banks of the wey stuart was
her kinsman their youth had been spent together and maxwell was in
some degree indebted to the man whom he betrayed for his alliance with
this unfortunate lady her esteem for the character of stuart had never
been diminished a meeting between them was occasioned by a tour which
the latter had undertaken in the year after his return from america
to wales and the western counties this interview produced pleasure and
regret in each their own transactions naturally became the topics of
their conversation and the untimely fate of his wife and daughter were
related by the guest

mrs maxwell's regard for her friend as well as for the safety of her
husband persuaded her to concealment but the former being dead
and the latter being out of the kingdom she ventured to produce mrs
stuart's letter and to communicate her own knowledge of the treachery
of maxwell she had previously extorted from her guest a promise not to
pursue any scheme of vengeance but this promise was made while ignorant
of the full extent of maxwell's depravity and his passion refused to
adhere to it

at this time my uncle and i resided at avignon among the english
resident there and with whom we maintained a social intercourse was
maxwell this man's talents and address rendered him a favorite both
with my uncle and myself he had even tendered me his hand in marriage
but this being refused he had sought and obtained permission to
continue with us the intercourse of friendship since a legal marriage
was impossible no doubt his views were flagitious whether he had
relinquished these views i was unable to judge

he was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs to which i had
likewise been invited when stuart abruptly entered the apartment
he was recognized with genuine satisfaction by me and with seeming
pleasure by maxwell in a short time some affair of moment being
pleaded which required an immediate and exclusive interview maxwell
and he withdrew together stuart and my uncle had been known to each
other in the german army and the purpose contemplated by the former in
this long and hasty journey was confided to his old friend

a defiance was given and received and the banks of a rivulet about
a league from the city was selected as the scene of this contest my
uncle having exerted himself in vain to prevent an hostile meeting
consented to attend them as a surgeon next morning at sun-rise was
the time chosen

i returned early in the evening to my lodgings preliminaries being
settled between the combatants stuart had consented to spend the
evening with us and did not retire till late on the way to his hotel
he was exposed to no molestation but just as he stepped within the
portico a swarthy and malignant figure started from behind a column
and plunged a stiletto into his body

the author of this treason could not certainly be discovered but the
details communicated by stuart respecting the history of maxwell
naturally pointed him out as an object of suspicion no one expressed
more concern on account of this disaster than he and he pretended
an ardent zeal to vindicate his character from the aspersions that were
cast upon it thenceforth however i denied myself to his visits and
shortly after he disappeared from this scene

few possessed more estimable qualities and a better title to happiness
and the tranquil honors of long life than the mother and father of
louisa conway yet they were cut off in the bloom of their days and
their destiny was thus accomplished by the same hand maxwell was the
instrument of their destruction though the instrument was applied to
this end in so different a manner

i leave you to moralize on this tale that virtue should become the
victim of treachery is no doubt a mournful consideration but it will
not escape your notice that the evils of which carwin and maxwell were
the authors owed their existence to the errors of the sufferers all
efforts would have been ineffectual to subvert the happiness or shorten
the existence of the stuarts if their own frailty had not seconded
these efforts if the lady had crushed her disastrous passion in the
bud and driven the seducer from her presence when the tendency of
his artifices was seen if stuart had not admitted the spirit of absurd
revenge we should not have had to deplore this catastrophe if wieland
had framed juster notions of moral duty and of the divine attributes
or if i had been gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight the
double-tongued deceiver would have been baffled and repelled

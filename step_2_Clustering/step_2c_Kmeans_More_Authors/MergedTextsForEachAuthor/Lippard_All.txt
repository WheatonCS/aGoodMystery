they
are strangely superstitious these wild

men of the prairie who with rifle in hand

and the deep starlight of the illimitable

heavens above wander in silence over the

trackless yet blooming wilderness left

to their own thoughts they seem to see

spectral forms rising from the shadows

and hear voices from the other world in

every unusual sound among their superstitions

there is one which has often struck

me with its singular interest and beauty





mss of a texan







come brother it is a beautiful viewlook

yonder 
the boy advanced from the shadow of the

oak and gazed upon the prairie bathed in the

light of the setting sun he was but a boy

slender and girlish in form and yet he grasped

a rifle in his hand and carried a knife in

his belt 
his brother did not seem to heed him but

stood leaning against the trunk of the oak his

arms folded over his rifle while his downcast

eyes were fixed upon the sod the sun in

its last glow cast a warm light over his broad

chest and muscular form and invested with a

golden flush his fine aquiline features shaded





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



by a dark beard and flowing black hair it

was altogether a striking face the eyes

somewhat sunken beneath the welldefined

brows were large black and strangely brilliant

he would have been observed and

gazed at in any company and even now as

he stood beside the oak the boundless prairie

around and the great god above there was

something noble in his look and bearing it is

true he wore a plaid grey frock reaching to

the knee and edged with fur yet this unpretending

garment displayed a broad chest supported

by a waist at once slender and pliable

and revealed the iron outline of his sinewy

arms its color pale grey gave a richer

lustre to the sunset glow which bathed his

face 
on the sod before him lay his hat a rude

thing of grey felt with skullcrown and wide

slouching brim it was decorated with a

single black feather 
come brother john look is it not a

beautiful view our men the volunteers of

prairie eden encamped on the prairie near

this knoll their horses grazing on the rich

grass as gathered in a circle their rifles near

them they build the campfire and prepare

for their evening meal look at the sky

johnnot one cloud yes one a little

cloud hovering like a bird in the west just

over the setting sun and turning blue purple

and gold as the light grows brighter ere

it fades the prairie johnthe grass moving

like waves at sea with all kinds of beautiful

flowers starting from the sod come

dont stand muttering there come i say 
and the slender boy laid his hand upon his

brothers arm and playfully sought to raise

his head 
the brother still absorbed in his thoughts

did not heed him 
here we are thirty miles from san antonio

shall we go forwardshall we return

home 
homepshaw did not we leave prairie

eden this morningwe 



we
 echoed the older brother raising

his eyes and surveying the girlish form before

him 
yes
we
the voluntears of prairie eden

composed of mr jacob grywins two sons

forty white laborerssome civilized people

from the states others german emigrants

and ten black slaves not to mention ewen

mcgregor who now comes up the knoll to

speak with
captain
john grywin 
john raised his eyes surveyed for a moment

the smoke of the camp fire in the prairie

not one hundred yards from where he

stood and then his gaze rested upon the new

comer 
you will observe that the knoll on which

the brothers stood was one of those delicious

green islands which dot the rolling surface of

the wild texan prairie and are seen by the

wayfarer sometimes at the distance of thirty

miles it was crowned by a solitary tree a

greak oak whose trunk three men could not

have spanned with their extended arms

broad and wide above the brothers head

stretched out the rugged branches clad in a

glorious drapery of silvery moss which floated

like a shining shroud among the deep

green leaves 
captain john while the boys take their

supper ive come up here to have a little

talk with you 
it was a harsh grating voice the figure

was that of a giant so towering in stature so

massive in the bulllike chest and formidable

long arms whose corded sinews were impressed

upon the folds of the grey sleeves

the face was like the form huge and burly

a red visage with white eyebrows and eyelashes

short stiff red hair and an immense

red beard matted like the mane of some wild

animal it was not the most prepossessing

form in the world nor the prettiest face yet

an air of bluff hearty frankness seemed to

pervade each featureeven the mouth with

thick lips and the large eyes with yellowish

ballsand govern the movement of every





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



limb as ewen mcgregor drew near the

oak 
well ewen or rather lieutenant mcgregor

 said john 
you see when we left prairie eden this

morning bound for san antonio in obedience

to a proclamation of the president of texas

which summoned all good citizens to the

western frontier menaced as it is by a fresh

mexican invasionwhen we left i say there

was some things which we
did
know and

some things which we
ought
to know but

did

not

know by 
well ewen said john calmly surveying

the bluff form hefore him while harry

looked on with a sort of comical wonder dilating

his clear blue eyes 
we are going to san antonio resumed

ewen resting his rifle on the sod for

days there has been a rumor of the approach

of the mexican general who commands at

presidio del rio grande how do we know

that at this very moment this general don

bascus is not in possession of san antonio

 
if we dont know we can easily ascertain

a ride of thirty miles after dark will bring

us to san antonio before midnight 
this cool respone seemed to disconcert the

bluff ewen 
but capt john suppose the town should

be occupied by some thousand mexican

devils 
that would make us equal fifty white

men of texas are equivalent to one thousand

mexicans any day that computation is in

some degree unfair for it gives one texan and

his good rifle for twenty mexicans you see

ewen general bascus and his thousand men

must not stand in the way of fifty volunteers

from prairie eden 
not mentioning the ten niggers laughed

harry as he mischievously pulled red ewen

by the heard well fling the darkies in

and not make any charge for them 
was it a flush of anger that crossed ewens


face he was silent for a moment and then

in a voice and with a manner which indicated

a man of some education he resumed 
let us dismiss all jesting on the subject

john general bascus whose approach is

indicated by a rumor that grows more like

truth every hour has not merely a thousand

men but ten thousand incarnate devils with

him suppose you go on to san antonio to

night and fall into his clutches just think

of it johnyou and your brother and all

your laborors and slaves dragged away to rot

in a mexican prison while your
father
and


isabel
await your return at prairie eden 
this picture touched john with great force

harrys smile died away and tears filled his

blue eyes 
o john ewen speaks the truth what

would become of father and isabel in case

we were taken prisoners 
yes i see it now i was wrong this morning

to leave them so utterly unprotected at

prairie eden to be sure our home is isolated

their is not much danger from the indians

and as for the neighbors the nearest

is ten miles from prairie eden but what

would you propose 
remain encamped here tonight it will

be time enough for us to go on our way tomorrow

morning and in the meantime

but look to the east do you see that knoll

distant some ten miles 
they followed the direction of his brawny

hand and saw the knoll rising dim and

vague among the mists which began to

whiten the eastern prairie 
i know ben davis the scout who has

pitched his cabin there if any one can give

us any news of the mexicans hes the man to

do it by your leave i will take my horse

ride over there and have a talk with him i

can be back long afore midnight 
johns face manifested some thought it

seems about the best course 
oh let him gothink of fatherisabel





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



cried harry sezing his brother by both his

hands 
ewen smiled at harrys earnestness and

smiled until his thick lips parted and his decayed

irregular teeth were visible 
well ewen youd better go and mind

ye let your return be as speedy as possible

 
trust me for
that
 
and red ewen turned away without a

moments delay and descended the knoll

bending his steps towards the encampment

they saw his broad knife glistening in the

sun as he crushed the grass with his long

heavy strides 
do you remember ewen in philadel

harry began as he surveyed the peaceful

group of the encampment of rugged hunters

encircling the fires which sent their volumes

of pale blue smoke into the sky 
hush and johns brow grew dark his

eye flashed with sudden intensity we never

mention that name in the prairie 
there he goes the giant with red head

and thick lips look how he rides 
wishing to drive his brothers thoughts

from a painful topic he stretched forth his

small white hand and pointed towards ewen

who was seen dashing towards the east

mounted on one of those fiery horses peculiar

to the prairie with eyes like coals and

long black matted mane 
john stood buried in thought the twilight

was gathering over the prairie and in the

broad west glowed the last flush of the departed

sun a fresh breeze arose and came

tossing the grass like waves as it gathered

perfume from the innumerable flowers 
henry gazed with some awe in the face of

his older brother and saw his brow grow

darker his eye more wild and absent in its

glance 
its always the way with him when i mention

that name he said and turned away to

the western edge of the knoll 


it
was a very beautiful thing to see the


last flush of the day imparting its soft golden

warmth to that boyish face whose white brow

and clear blue eyes seemed animated with a

deep tranquil delight 
the boy was gazing to the west far far

over the boundless view as the night seemed

hovering above the prairie pausing for a moment

ere it came down to kiss its flowers and

sleep upon its breast 
far in the northwest the level line of the

horizon was broken by an almost imperceptible

elevation which shone like a golden point

from the shadows which sheltered around and

beneath henry gazed upon that elevation

earnestly and long until his breath came in

gasps his blue eye acquired a light wellnigh

as intense as his brothers 
that must be
prairie eden
 he said as

sinking on the sod he crossed his hands upon

his knees and thought while the night came

down of home of father and isabel 
the night came slowly in its starlight drapery

and still the boy harry sat in silence on

the edge of the prairie knoll his slender form

couched artlessly on the tall thick grass while

his eyes were raised to the heavens and an

indefinable emotion stole over his face believe

me it was a face to love so much of

woman in its every outline and yet a firmness

like that of tried manhood manifested

in the sudden flash of the blue eyes the quick

nervous compression of the warm lips 
and the breeze tossed his soft brown hair

and floated it in glossy masses over his forehead

but could not hide the tears that came

imperceptibly into his eyes and made them

shine the brighter in the deep starlight 
i know what they are now doing now at

prairie eden i can see the wide hall lighted

up and father sitting near the table with

the bible on his knee sister is near him

bending over his shoulder as he reads yes

yes i can see her black ringlets touching his

grey hair and floating upon his fore head it

is a happy home and




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






his fancy dared not look upon the picture

of the future for a vision of war and battles

rose up before him and while his young blood

danced with the raptures of a soldiers life he

seemed to hear a voice which said

and

that home you will never reach again

 
long he sat there absorbed in his own

thoughts while from the other side of the

knool the songs and merry voices of the encamped

volunteers of prairie eden broke unheeded

on his ear at last his waking thoughts

melted in a dream and sinking on the sod

with the rifle in his hand he slept the sound

sleep of boyhoodthat sleep worth all the

gold and power in the world for angels watch

over it and fan the sleepers cheek with their

invisible wings 
he unclosed his eyes at last and started up

halfdreaming and but half awake the

morn was rising over the prairie far in the

east a globe of pale gold was seen on the verge

of the horizon gleaming a sad and solemn

light as it was about to launch away into the

great ocean of the sky 
as harry started to his feet a dark object

interposed between his sight and the moon

he passed his hand over his forehead and

with the peculiar nervous fear of one suddenly

aroused from a sound slumber uttered an

ejaculation that broke with startling emphasis

on the dead silence of the prairie 
for all was dead and still the camp fires

had gone out the song of the hunters died

away not a voice nor soundno vision

but the great prairie stretching forth in the

light of the rising morn with that unknown

object towering black and dark before him 
who comes there he stood with the

rifle in his grasp his finger on the trigger 
a voice answered himcould it be his brothers

so changed and hollowharry it is

i it scarcely rose above a whisper

hushnot a word our horses are ready

at the foot of the knollcome 
wondering whether he was awake or

dreaming he suffered that extended arm to


lead him silently down the knoll he saw his

own horse and his brothers standing there

the saddles on the horses the reins flung over

their necks and for the first time recognized

his brother in the dusky figure 
mount and his brothers face was turned

to the moon harry saw with indefinable

fear that the features were changed his eyes

unnaturally vivid and glaring the broad forehead

marked with swollen veins 
brother he faltered out as he placed

his feet in the stirrups 
not a word turn your horse towards

prairie eden and ride as though a thousand

deaths were dogging at his heels do not

spare the spurfollow me 
johns horse plunged beneath the merciless

iron and dashed through the grass as

though possessed by a devil 
henry saw his brothers form rising boldly

in the moonlight and urged his own horse

forward at the top of his speed 
but the volunteers brother he cried as

he gasped for breath 
ride i say that star in the northwest

you see it dont take your eyes from it

on in the name of god that star shines

above prairie eden 
away they dashed without a word their

horses maddened by the sharp steel points

bounding over the sod with an accelerating

speed that seemed rather like the flight of a

bird than the pace of an animal 
not a word passed between the brothers

for harry panting for breath and racked by

the plunging gait of his horse looked on the

form of john wiih an unknown feeling something

between wonder and awe 
once or twice a word trembled on his lips

but still his brother without turning his

head muttered between his teeth 
ridespur it is thirty miles to prairie

edenwe must reach it in two hours or we

are accursed for ever 
there was something terrible in the sight

these black horses with snorting nostrils





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



and starting eyeballs plunging over the prairie

while their riders dug the spurs into their

flanks until the blood spouted forth and mingled

with the white foam 
the moon shone over them as they dashed

away and flung their shadows far and black

upon the waving grass john never once

turned his head but kept his eye fixed on the


star
 harry could not keep his gaze from

his brothers changed and ghastly faceit

held him like a spell 
at lastit was when the moon was high

above the horizon and an hour and a half had

passed awayharrys horse stumbled and

fell the blood pouring in torrents from his

nostrils 
severely bruised and halfstunned harry

struggled from beneath the flanks of his dying

horse and saw john reining his steed back

on his haunches 
your horse is dyingcome give me

your hand spring up before menow then

yonder is the island knoll of prairie eden

only five miles distant 
harry felt his brothers strong arm around

his chest and saw his eyesalmost touching

his cheekflash with the same unnatural fire

he felt that his brother was mad and grew

cold as ice although the breath that fanned

his cheek was like the air of a furnace


 
only four milesdo you see the knoll

harry the house among the trees

ah 
down came the horse upon his kneeshe

made an effort to rise trembling in every

nerveit was in vain with that desperate

effort he rolled upon the sod the brothers

half bruised beneath his quivering flanks it

was scarcely an instant before john had gained

his feet and rescued his brother from his

perilous situation 
harryare you hurt have you strength

left to run those four miles take your rifle

and come 
he clutched his brother in an iron grasp


add hurried him away rather dragging him

along than running by his side 
it may have been a dream he muttered

but no noi saw
him
with my eyes

before me 
saw
him
 harry gasped as all the

blood in his body seemed rushing to his

eyes 
yes i saw
him
no visionreality my

brother horrible reality my god the moon

fades the day is breaking weve at least

four miles to go do not fall harry do not

fainta firm heart my boy and god will

but tonight as i stood beside the oak while

you lay sleeping near me i saw
him
 with

his white beard and spectral eyes andhe

was dressed like an old hunter harryyou

have heard the old prairie hunters tell of him

how he walks the prairie at dead of night

and starts suddenly upon you from the earth

at your horses side or even from the sod

where you lay sleeping he wakes you with

an icecold handso the hunters tell the

story but you know they are superstitious

i believe in nothing of the kindibut tonight

i saw him at my side look harry

the sun is rising and were three miles from

the knoll 
thus gasping these incoherent words as

he dragged his awestricken and fainting brother

along john kept his eyes upon the knoll

and his face grew even yet more pale his

eyes more frenzied as the first ray of the

rising sun shot like a golden thread across

their path 
saw whom speak john your face

frightens mei believe im dying he

sank on one knee 
harry my dear boymy childoh do

not faint now in a little while and we are

there you are strong harry it is but fancy

a home in the wilderness for the wanderers

and outcasts of civilization





texan mss





a lone indian stood on the summit of the

mound 
it was in the centre of one of those prairies

which in their boundless view their vast

horizon remind us of the ocean only for

waves of foam we behold emerald grass

tossing with gentle undulations their summits

crested by the roses of the wild rising into

view like sea foam tinted by the last glow of

a setting sun 
these prairies like the ocean have their

islandsgreen mounds that rise above the

boundless level blossoming on their banks

with flowers and vines crowned on the summit

with aged trees that stand in circular

groups like the solemn mourners over the

dead centuries 
a lone indian leaning on his rifle his muscular

form attired in a panthers hide which

left his sinewy arms and broad chest bare to

the light stood on the summit of a green

island in the centre of that boundless prairie 
his head was drooped his dark eye fixed

by strange emotions glared with an immoveable

gaze over the glorious view 
around the prairie that rolled away far

into the distance until it became lost in the

hazy line of the horizon above the blue sky

of a summers day dimpled only by a group

of snowy clouds that seemed to undulate in


midair the clear azure gleaming distinctly

through their feathery folds even as a virgins

bosom looks more beautiful through a veil of

lace by his side a massive oak the broad

green leaves almost touching the tuft on his

shaven brow alone that indian stood his

body turned to the west while with his face

over his shoulder he gazed long and sadly

upon the eastern land 
it was a sad gaze eloquent as a smile

upon the lips of a dying man whose veins are

racked by superhuman torture 
the trees of the island grove were all

around him giant oaks not more than

twenty in number circled on a space some

three hundred yards square their trunks

were like the huge pillars of some temple

reared in the wilderness to god massive as

blocks of granite and encrusted with the

thick bark that had been hardening for centuries

three hundred years had written

their dusky memories upon that rugged rind

of the ancient oaken trees white moss

clothed their farspreading branches and

graceful vine blossoms trembled among their

leaves of luxuriant green 
a hundred men might have encamped with

ease beneath each grand old oak and found

shelter from the sun and rain in the shadow

the silence the fragrant air of the green island

of the boundless prairie 
the sod smooth as a floor and covered

with dark green moss was sprinkled with

flowers whose unnumbered shapes of graceful

beauty and dyes of rainbow loveliness

neither pencil nor pen can ever paint upon





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



the foliage quivered the drops of last nights

shower 
and in the centre of the island a spring of

clear cold water bubbled into light between

two huge rocks and without a visible outlet

kept murmuring and sparkling forever always

clear cold and pure 
the indian gazed to the west and the silent

eloquence of his deep eye found vent in

his rude indian tongue 
my fathers dwelt here when these giant

trees were saplings not higher than my rifle

where are they now before this knoll itself

was reared as the grave of warriors red

men were upon this soil the kings the prophets

of their people where are they now

the bones of the mighty men rest in the bosom

of this knollbut their children where

are they look for them far away by the

great salt lake in the land of the setting

sun 
once more the indian turned his eye to the

east as though in the dim line of the horizon

he already discerned the banners and bayonets

of white civilization and then turning

sadly away he sat him down by the waters of

the island spring 
water that comes from the caverns where

my fathers sleep i drink from your fountain

once more and drink for the last time ere i

depart forever 
bathing his hands and brow in the pure

element of the island fountain he went on

his way toward the west and came back no

more 
years passed on and that prairie of the

wilderness was left to solitude and god in

the tall grass the deer with branching horns

and mild eyes moved over the flowers the

roses the dahlias and the lilies of the desert

without a fear along the summit of the island

came herds of wild cattle drinking one

by one at the pure springgazing for a moment

at the boundless yiew and then dashing

away through the sea of undulating grass like

a cloud hurled by a thunder storm some


times the wolf gaunt and lean and treacherous

as a hypocrite stole over the sod of the

island grove and the caguar with its flashing

eye and sleek fur dipped his bloodstreaked

jaws in the clear wave of the island fountain


 
but man came nevermore along the prairie

the indiansearch for him toward the

west in the land of the setting sun the

white manyonder in the region of the

rising sun he dwells his footsteps have

never pressed this virgin soil 
ten years passed and a strange sight was

seen one summer morning upon the summit of

the island grove 
a large mansion reared in the space between

those circling trees and built of massive

logs disclosed its lofty hall door its

many windows and its steep roof varied by

numerous chimnies to the beams of the rising

sun 
the huge trees stretched forth their boughs

above its roof and the vines trailed in festoons

about its windows its black timbers looked

out from the graceful drapery of the white

moss hanging like a silvery shroud from

branch to branch and from tree to tree 
altogether this huge mansion looked like

a baronial fabric of the middle ages invested

as it was with the tokens of a barbarous luxury

something between savage grandeur and

refined civilization it was two stories in

height with four spacious rooms on a floor

these rooms were divided on the first floor

by a spacious hall on the second by a corridor


 
instead of paint or plaster the walls of log

were concealed by hangings of various hues

and devices some of dark green cordovan

leather edged with gold some of the richest

silk the chairs the tables the fire places

and the stairway were all on the same scale

of antique grandeur mingling luxury and

rudeness in every detail 
from the centre of their island grove this

spacious mansion rose with the green sod all





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



around it the trees half closing it from the sun

and rain the cool fountain bubbling near it

some few paces to the west 
yonder north of the grove you behold

fields of emerald corn with small huts built

of logs rising from the quivering leaves on

the prairie graze herds of sleek cattle iheir

dappled sides contrasting with the rich grass

around the quivering beds of wild flowers beneath

and at the morning time a column

of blue smoke rises over the tops of the trees

and glows like the white breast of a bird

turned to the rising sun it is incense from

the fireside of the prairie home 
who is it that dwells within the prairie

home 
a father and his three children 
that father a man of slender form grey

hairs and sad aspect he was known by the

name of jacob grywin the nearest neighbort

who lived only ten miles from the island

grovelooked with wonder mingled with

some awe upon the sad stern man who had

so suddenly erected his home in the wilderness


 
he cameno one knew whither in the

year after the young texas had struggled

into independence through the bloody

clouds of soliad the alamo and san jancentho

the emigrant first appeared on the prairie

and with his family of three children his

retainerssome fifty in number and mostly

from the statessome dozen german colonisis

and as many slaves reared the mansion

known by the appropriate name

prairie

eden

 
two years had passed and the unknown

emigrant living in a kind of barbarous splendour

beheld his children rising round him

like fruit and flowers nursed into vigorous

bloom by the air of the wilderness 
his sons presented a strong contrast john

aged twentyone was a man of stalwart yet

graceful propoetions with a dark brown visage

strongly marked with aquiline features

and shadowed by dark hair and beard he


was a magnificent horseman and a fearless

hunter as he mounted his dark bay horse

with his riffe old king death as he quaintly

called it slung over his shoulder his long

hair floating in the wind and his eaglelike

features marked boldly out against the sky

he looked for all the world like a true knight

of the chivalric age 
harry his brother a mere boy of sixteen

with girlish form and beardless face along

whose smooth outline flowed his curling brown

hair compared with john reminded you of

the quivering sapling beside the hardy oak

and yet there was a volume of daring in the

glance of his dark blue eye john loved him

as though he was at once father brother and

friend to girlish harryeven as david loved

jonathan with a love passing the love of women


 
the third child three years younger than

john and of course one year older than

harry i see her now standing upon the

porch of the mansion her dark hair plainly

turned aside from the warm beauty of her

face while her round arms full bust and

passionate eyes attest an impetuous nay a

voluptuous woman 
she was indeed one of the women whom

we call queenly especially in case our

knowledge of queens is limited her stature

was commanding her complexion a clear

deep olive burning with red bloom on each

cheek her lips full and warm and tinted

with dewy vermillion her forehead white

and high with the jetblack hair shadowing

its outlines 
these words may give you some idea of

bel grywin but no words can describe how

suddenly her face changed its expression

now glooming like a thunder storm the eyes

armed with lightning and the brow gathering

blackness and in a moment soft and yielding

and tender as the face of a slumbering

child 
when the eye of the father rested upon the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



faces of his children the cloud passed from

his brow but when he was alone either

striding along the porch of his mansion in

gazing silently over the great prairie or passing

with catlike step from room to room

there was a gloom upon his features which

to say the least was not pleasant to behold 
that sidelong glance toward the window

or the door that involuntary start at the sound

of a footstep what did they mean 
what need jacob grywin fear centered

in the midst of this prairie afar from civilization

and yet surrounded by all its comforts

nay its luxuries his children blooming round

him and his slaves and laborers ready to do

his will what had he to fear 
there came a day in the spring of 

when the proclamation of the texan president

summoned all good citizens to the western

frontier in order to defend the soil of the

young state from a threatened invasion

mexico was of course known to be the invader

and the impulse of the invasion santa

anna 
vague rumors floated over the prairie telling

of outrages on the frontier and it soon

became a settled opinion that santa anna

like the bourbons could neither forget nor

learn it became evident that the horrid

butcheries of past years were again to be enacted

on texan soil that santa anna who

had been dragged from a swamp clad in the

garb of one of his lacqueys after the battle of

san jacintopresenting a rather contemptible

image of despair had not forgiven the

texans for sparing his life in a certain view

of the matter he was right for if even a murderer

forfeited his life by a series of coldblooded

butcheries that murderer was don

antonio lopez de santa anna 


among other rumors it was announced that

don general something from the oresidio

it
was deep night and the stars shone with

their calm sad light over the mansion and the

grove of prairie eden 
in the mansion all was still as death the

old man slumbered in his chamber on the

ground floor his daughter slept in her room

on the second floor all the other chambers

were tenantless and a silence like the tomb

brooded over the corridors of that prairie

home the wind sighed mournfully through

the tops of the trees as their mossy branches

swept the roof the sound of the island fountain

making low music as it bubbled from

its cavern source was heard in every pausa

of the breeze 
yet within the mansiontenanted only by

the old man and his childall was darkness

and silence 
the chamber of isabel 
a large room lighted by a lamp that stands

upon a table near the bed and sheds a feeble

and flickering ray it is shadowy here in

this bower of virgin repose and yet you may

discern the luxurious details of the place

soft matting on the floor whose downlike

texture would not return too rudely the pressure

of an infants naked foot curtains of

pale crimson silk hanging from the ceiling

nd imparting a warm roseate glow io the


face of the sleeper yonder an image of the

divine virgin a marble shape elevated on its

snowy pedestal and over the mantel a picture

of a wildwood scene in fardistant pennsylvania


 
the bed with curtains and coverlet and

pillows all like a snow bank freshly fallen

from the sky so pure so white so spotless

the curtain is slightly parted through the interval

gleams the vision of that face framed

in the darkly flowing hair and pillowed on

right arm that bosom which now is lost to

view and now quivers into light above the

tremulous lace of the night robe a beautiful

woman slumbering with her lips so ripe in

their red bloom gently parted until they disclose

the white teeth the eyes closed with

the long black fringes resting on the cheek

it is a sight for angels to behold and love 
she tosses in her slumberyou see a full

round arm with its small hand all beautiful

as an arm and hand of alabaster tinted by

the daybreak flush extened from the curtains

you hear a whispered word then the sleeper

sinks again into repose like death and a

single black tress curves over her neck and

nestles on her bosom 
at this moment a faint creaking sound is

heard and all is still again the door slowly

opens and a face leering with a hideous

smile appears in the dusky interval a cautious

catlike footstep and a form advances

to the maidens bed and the light of the taper

reveals a strange picture




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






that face with short stiff hair and shaggy

beard alike scarlet red in hue the bleared

eyes and the thick lips laughing the same

brutal scorn upon the sleeping woman that

almost giant form clad in the costume of a

mexican ranchero wide pantaloons ornamented

with glittering buttons green jacket

tawdry with gilt trappings and a stout leather

belt girdling two pistols and a long and quivering

knife 
who is this ruffian that dares intrude upon

the sanctity of a maidens bed chamber 
he sweeps aside the curtains bends his

head his breath pollutes the cheeks of the

slumbering isabel 
you see his thick lips parting in a brutal

grin his huge arms extended his colorless

eyeballsso white and bleared and glossy

fire with a gloating intensity 
the white breast the round neck the warm

countenance of isabel lay open to that gaze

of pollution 
he turns to the doorlistens all is

still the hand of the ruffin plays upon the

hilt of his knife but it is for a moment only

extending his brawny arms he grasps her

form and tears her halfnaked from her virgin

bed 
in a moment the room is vacant the outlines

of that pure womans form is still traced

upon the pillow the lamp yet burns on the

table but the room is silent and tenantless 
but did you see that unconscious form

bound in the ruffians arms did youeven

as he left the roomsee that face turned

over his shoulder the long black hair

showering down his back as the eyes unclosed

with a frightened glance 
there is a gasping halfsuppressed cry in

the corridor withouta hurried footstep and

all is still again 
when isabel thus rudely torn from her

bed unclosed her eyes she beheld the dark

green hangings of the eastern room on the

ground floor 
pinioned in the ruffians arm she gazed


around with the frightened glance of one suddenly

aroused from a dreamless slumber and

beheld that wide room crowded by the forms

of armed men attired in the halfbandit halfsoldier

costume of mexican rancheroes a

solitary ruffian stood alone in the centre of

the group his slender form and bearded face

revealed by the light of the blazing pine knot

which he raised above his head with his right

hand 
that light flashed strongly over the green

jackets and tinsel trappings of the soldiers

and played upon the blade of every long and

quivering knife 
for a moment the maiden trembled with

fright as she beheld that swarty face scowling

all around her but that moment passed

the warm blood coursed over her face and

bosom with a sudden movement she flung

herself from the ruffians arms and confronted

the assassin band 
why this outrage she cried dashing

the clustering hair aside from her face and

fixing the glance of an indignant eye upon

the foremost of the group she looked very

beautiful that halfclad woman whose clasped

arms were dressed upon her tumultuous

bosom with her unbound hair streaming over

her white shoulders 
there was dead stillness and then a deep

groan from the dark recesses of the room 
the bandits parted and in the interval

made by their movement to either side appeared

an old man whose slender form was

clad in plain black while his strongly marked

features were rendered ghastly by a livid

paleness 
my father you here bound too and in

these ruffians arms 
the old man jacob grywin replied by

wringing his pinioned arms and uttering a

low deep moan 
my sons my sons why did i suffer them

to depart for san antonio my men too

all are gone and here i am would to god

i had only faithful ewen here




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






he spoke of the overseer of his plantation

that brave hardy fellow who had left for san

antonio in company with his sons 
a hoarse laugh echoed round the chamber

at once jocob looked up and isabel turned

as though a viper had bit her heel 
your faithful ewen is here said the

voice of the ruffian who had torn isabel from

her bed 
there he stood dressed like the rancheroes

his stiff red hair and matted red beard

imparting new hideousness to his bleared eyes

and grinning lips 
the old man was speechless you see

isabella survey the ruffian from head to foot

while her face changes color now red as daybreak

now white as a shroud 
aye its meewen mcgregor red

ewen or whatever the boys choose to call

me i
am
here this band of trusty spirits

are mine i have come here at dead of night

to secure this traitor to the republic of mexico

we had hard riding to reach the place in

timea great many weary miles since nine

oclock somewhat in a hurry you know

for tomorrow morning your sons will be home

byetheby i left john and harry at sunset

they were quite well 
he drew his knife and playfully felt its

sharp edge 
my god can this be real moaned the

old man 
i tell you it can be and it is 
but you were my friendmy overseer

you followed my fortunes into the wilderness

ewen a traitor no no i will not believe

it 
the ruffian advanced confronted the old man

and glowered upon him with his bloodshot

eyes 
you talk of traitor
you
 the broken

bank director of philadelphia who turned


traitor
to the trust of some thousand widows

and orphans and then fled the city seeking

refuge for his guilty wealth in the prairie of

texas sixty miles from san antonio oh


jacob pshaw man i know you you

forget that i was your clerk 
it was a hard blow the old man felt it to

the heart 
as for isabel she stood like a thing of marble

frightfully pale her clasped hands pressed

nervously against her bared bosom 
you here too my pretty one the ruffian

sneered as he turned upon her in my

power you were once the
aristocratic
lady

of the aristocratic mansion in philadelphia


now
 
a movement was observable among the

soldiers and a form advanced into the glare of

the pine torch 
it was a young man slenderly made with

an olive cheek and long flowing curls of jet

black hair his beard and moustache all

curling and as soft as silk imparted a chivalric

appearance to his delicately cut features

his eyes were very large and bright and

withal intensely black their expression was

peculiar indefinable 
a closefitting uniform of dark green relieved

by a single row of gold buttons displayed

the elegant proportions of his form 
isabel he whispered we did not anticipate

this moment when last we met 
he bowed low before the halfclad maiden

and looked on her with upraised eyes 
don antonio was all that trembled from

the lips of the wondering girl 
it was a strange group the central figures

that handsome soldier with the olive cheek

and smooth silken beard the beautiful girl

whose flowing hair but faintly concealed the

fluttering of her bosom the light held overhead

by the brigand soldier the livid face of

the father and the brutal sneer of ewen distinctly

revealed by its glarethe encircling

rancheroes and the dark background of the

curtained walls 
a strange group now shown in red light

again darkened by the shadows as they went

and came 
don antonio drew near the maiden





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



extending an elegent cloak of rich purple velvet

edged with golden fringe gently he

flung it over her shoulders and as her bosom

was veiled beneath its solds he whispered


 
isabel for the sake of the holy trinity

let me see you
alone
alone for one moment

only 
he spoke in english somewhat fluently

though with a decided spanish accent there

seemed a more eloquent language so thought

isabel in his large lustrous eyes 
come she whispered and led the way

from the room 
you must be in a hurry i tell ye they

heard the coarse tones of red ewen for we

have got a heap of justice to do and little

time to do it in 
up the stairway she led him and scarce

knowing whither she went entered the bedchamber

from which she had been torn only

a moment past 
there by the light of the taper which

stood upon the table near the bed there in

silence and gloom of that virgin retreat they

confronted each other 
isabel very pale with her white arms appearing

from the folds of the purple cloak her

naked feet touching the soft matting on the

floor don antonio with his brow uncovered

his head drooped his upturned eyes resting

on the halfshrouded form before him 
speak she gasped this outrage 
the words died on her tongue 
in a voice tremulous with delicate modulations

don antonio spoke still maintaining

that resyectful bearing 
you are in danger isabel last thursday

at our nearest military post sixty miles

away this ruffian ewen appeared denounced

your father to the colonel of our regiment

stated the unprotected situation of prairie

eden and offered to lead a picked squadron

to the place 
ah i remember he was absent two days


last week but what charge could the traitor

prefer against my father 
you know isabel that our government

have decreed a new invasion of the rebellious

province of texas our armies even now

are encamped on its southern border ewen

stated that your fathers house was often used

as a rendezvous for the rebel texans nay

that his sons his laborers his very slaves

within a few days depart to join the army of

some texan general at san antonio i fear

me it will go very hard with your father

this ewen is as cruel as brutal as traitors

always are 
but you can save us you whom we

knew in our prosperous days 
a meaning smile crossed the face of the

mexican 
i am only a subordinate officer red

ewen met us after sunset at a designated

point and took command of this squadron of

horse 
and my father 
may be put to death within an hour red

ewen seems to have some secret purpose of

revenge 
isabel sank to the floor not prostrate but

kneeling with her white arms upraised her

eyes streaming tears 
my god it seems like a hideous dream 
the mexican raised his hand to his eyes

was it to hide a tear 
but you can save us don antonio and

with a bound she passed the distance between

them and knelt at his feet you
will
save

us i see how it isyou only accompanied

this expedition to do us service o remember

how my fathers home in philadelphia was

once your home remember 
how the peerless isabel scorned the suit

of don antonio marin the attache of the

mexican legation at washington is it so

miss grywin 
was that a sneer upon his darkred lip

what meant that sudden lighting up of his

large eyes




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






isabel trembled shuddered as she beheld

the sudden change of the mexicans face in

an instant that expression was gone he was

composed and respectful again 
o you would not be so ungenerous as to

revive that memory now i was but young

vain frivolous then i refused your suit it is

true my father to that refusal added some

words at once needless and bitter but now

we are in danger you will save us 
rise lady on one condition i will

peril my life to save you 
he raised her gently from the floor she

stood there erect as a queen upon her throne

around her neck waved her glossy black hair

you could see her young bosom pant and

writhe beneath the velvet cloak 
one condition she murmured and waited

for him to speak 
he spoke it with his eyes with his parting

lips with that sudden gaze which devoured

every outline every tint of her voluptuous

form from the head framed in the

black hair to the feet as white as marble 
she shrank back as though a bullet had

pierced her brain 
no no no you cannot be so base

as to think it 
isabel the whisper husky with passion

fell on her ear like a torrent of boiling

lead the case is plain i love youhave

loved you for years be mine and i will

sacrifice my rank my honor to serve you 
be mineshe echoed his words and

looked at him with a dumb wandering stare 
he beckoned her to the window 
look yonder 
she looked but would not believe her eyes

there rolled the prairie silvered by the rising

moon but she saw it not nor dwelt on

the solemn beauty of that boundless sky 
but a pine torch flung its ruddy glow over

the sward in front of the mansion that

light revealed the bandit soldiers the form of

red ewen in their midst there with his


neck bared his brow uncovered his face livid

as death stood her father 
there was a rope about his neck and that

rope swung loosely as it was tied to the oaken

branch above his head 
isabel beheld that hideous picture and sunk

like a crushed flower on the floor all sense

all consciousness were gone her white

arms relieved by the purple cloak dropped

by her side a glimpse of her pulseless bosom

gleamed over the golden edge of the garment

she lay like a dead woman her face like

marble her eyes wide open and glassy 
don antonio bore her to the bed and

stamped his foot thrice upon the floor a burly

ranchero appeared in the shadows of the

doorway it was red ewen in his hunters

garb 
wine slave search the cellars of the

old heretic and bring me a goblet of his rich

old wine 
this it must be confessed did not look

very much like respecting red ewen as the


superior officer
 
a few brief moments passedthe lady

still lay swooningand ewen the newlyfledged

rachero appeared with a massy golden

cup in his hand its glittering flowers contrasting

with the purple gleam of the liquid

trembling against the brim 
begone and mark ye
don
ewen

commander

of the squadron of mexican horse



do as i have commanded you begone 
the ranchero was gone don antonio was

alone with the unconscious woman what

means that scowl glooming over his handsome

face what means that hand lifted

over the gobletthat white powder pouring

from the paper in his fingers down into the

red current of the wine 
he gazed upon her his black eyes dilating

until they assumed a tigerlike glare so

helpless she lay beside him unconscious upon

her virgin bed with her dark hair wound

about her round white throat so like an





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



image of purity carved out of parian marble

with her glassy eyes turned towards heaven 
ah that was a coward act don antonio

to sweep the cloak aside and gaze with

gloating eyes upon the shrine of purityher

white and pulseless bosom ah that was a

traitors kiss that kiss from your burning lips

pressed upon her lips as cold as clay 
awake isabel my love i will save your

father 
his arm is around her waisthe presses

his bearded cheek against her cheek of velvet

softness and his lips pressed with passion

quiver against hers 
dreamily she unclosed her eyes and all

unconscious as she was drank from the goblet

which he held to her lips 
then her countenance glowed a blush like

living flame overspread her face her eyes

seemed no fire with liquid light 
where am i she gasped ah these

forms that glide to and fro in the dance these

fountains that murmur drowsily in mine

ears these gardens where a thousand lights

break from the shadowy trees over groves of

flowers 
her mind wanders and don antonio

smiled until his white teeth shone like ivory

under his black moustache 
the maiden rose spread forth her arms

like one struggling with a fatal sleep the

cloak fell and that form which combined

all that is beautiful in the physical and intellectual

organization of woman glowed in the

light form its trembling veil the drugged

potion was in her veinsyou can see it in the

voluptuous dimness of her eyes in the deeper

red of her lips 
even in this moment her soul shone out

from the clouds which had begun to darken

it 
ah where am i don antonio is it

you my fatheroh save him such were

her incoherent words 
don antonio started to his feet and at once

there gleamed from his eyes a strange light


there broke over his lips a stranger smile 
listen isabelbut two minutes of consciousness

of volition are yours in those

brief minutes i will lay your fate before you

aye and you shall read it two years

ago in the city of washington you scorned

my suit scorned your father heaped insult

upon your scorn my time has come

unless you become minemine at this hour

mine without priest or vow i swear to leave

your father to his fate 
mercy 
that fate death by the rope at the hands

of the ruffian red ewen your brothers will

return by morning light but it will be too late

we will then be far on our way but your

father will swing on that tree before the door

of his home 
you cannot be human not one drop of

pity not one 
reflect i do not force your wishes

you may swoon but unless you say yes to

my proposal your father shall hang and you

will not feel my kiss upon your lips say

yes and i will save him i that love you

with a love that is merciless in its every pulsation

i that adore you so much that i will

wreck every moment of your existence unless

you consent to become mine 
he shook his small white hands above his

head in the impulse of the fiery thought

which corded every muscle of his face and

gleamed like an undying vengeance from his

eyes 
one moment only remains thinki

will not speak to you until that moment and

consciousness are gone 
he turned away into the darker corner of

the room 
standing near the bed her form erect her

black hair tossing on her brow she felt that

the drugged potion was working in her veins

and that the next minute would fire her heart

with the mad dream of voluptuous passion 
her mind was very clearlike a lake en





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



shrined in the hollow of a mountain top its

glassy surface unruffled by a breeze but the

next moment 
slowly she glided to the window again

that sightthe livid face the dangling rope

with a creeping shudder she turned away

and turned her eyes upon the tempter 
in the dim corner he stood his finger pressed

against his lip his dark eyes blazing upon

her even through the gloom 
pity her now all good angels 
she felt the blood rushing to her brain

she heard gentle voices singing songs as in

the air she saw soft masses of light playing

over the uncovered forms of dancing women

like a sleep that dream born of opium

possessed her nerves her brain her soul 
yes 
it is morning and a faint ray of light trembles

through the darkness of the corridor

let us await in this silence and gloom with

our eyes fixed upon the massive panels of

yonder door that door leads into the bedchamber

of isabel 
forth from that door as the rising sun

streams through the window glides a wild

figure with unbound hair and livid blue circles

under each glassy eye the bosom is

bare and maked the feetyou see the air

play with the scanty robebut the feet are

cold the bosom white pulseless like the frozen

breast of a dead woman 
is it a ghost can it be the warm and

blooming isabel who last night said the evening

prayer with her father and went singing to

her wirgin bed 


along the corridor she glides one word

quivering from her lipsfather 
no replythe mansion is deathly still 
down the stairs and out upon the porch

the rolling prairie with the sun rising over

its waves of grass and flowersthe blue sky

and the grouping clouds who hang above the

path of day catching his freshest kiss upon

their bosoms 
she saw it allfelt on her cold cheek the

fresh breath of morning but the soldiers

where are they ewendon antonio

where they are gone all gone she is left

alone with her father how can she meet his

gaze she thebut pity her good angels

and weep fiends as you behold your darkest

work 
father she cried and listened noreply

she turned from the sunrise and shuddered

as she anticipated the withering gaze of

that parent whose life she had bought with

hersoul 
she turned and saw her father he did

not frown upon his child nor smile there

was a cold calm look upon his face and his

eyes were steadily turned to the rising sun

but those eyes were glassy that face was discolored

for the father dangled in the air as

the rope was about his neck and the treebranch

quivered with his weight 
two forms were seen towards the east

she saw them as they came rapidly on and

greeted them with a shout of horrible laughter

chapter iv

the rancho salado







 
 






				 
				
				
			







			 
				
				 
 

				







there came an order from santa anna

stating that as these texans who had

honorably capitulated at mier were pirates

and robbers every tenth man of them

should

it
was a dreary rancho of dark stone one

story in height with a stunted and withered

tree before its low and narrow door to the

east extended a wall of stone of the same hue

as that which formed the rancho only that a

few miserable shrubs struggled into light between

the solid blocks 
around that rancho all was one monotonous

waste of sand as far as the eye could

see and far in the east and west rose a range

of barren hills their rugged peaks rushing

into the sunset sky 
a view more desolate cannot be imagined

the rancho with its wall encircling a space

some hundred feet square was the only object

that met the eye in all that waste of dreary

sand and barren cliffs 
a single black cloud with rugged edges

spread over the tops of the western hills and

veiled as in a pall the lust beams of the dying

sun 
the air was hot stifling like the atmosphere

of a furnace it was the close of a

long and sultry day a flock of vultures were

perched upon the flat roof of the rancho

folding their sluggish wings as they seemed

to scent the smell of human blood 


before the door waited a halfrobber form

dressed in the tawdry green jacket and wide

trowsers of a mexican ranchero there were

pistols in his belt as leaning on his rusty mus

ket he cast his sleepy eyes to the setting

sun 
this lonely farm house or military post

call it what you will was situated in the

heart of mexico some hundred and fifty miles

south of the city of saltillo 
it was called the
rancho salado
 
within the court yard hidden by the impenetrable

wall a scene of peculiar interest

was in progress 
one hundred and seventy men chained in

couples their faces worn by famine and rendered

more hideous by the uncombed hair

and unshaven beard were grouped in a circle

their shrunken forms wasted by long days

and nights of thirst hunger and cold were

miserably clad in rags that fluttered to every

breeze 
in the centre of that circle was a massive

log and on that log an earthen vessel resembling

an antique funeral urn 
around these gaunt and faminestricken

forms was grouped a solid mass of mexican

steel at least three hundred soldiers attired

in green gazed on the chained men and raised

thelr musquets in the light of the setting

sun 
near yonder post the colonel of the detachment

a man of some thirtyfive years with a

dark olive face rests his arms against the

wall and turns his face away from the group





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



of prisoners this colonel has seen much

bloodshed and washed his blade on many a

texan field but now the tears stream freely

down his battleworn cheeks 
his officers young men and aged clad in

the gay mexican array gaze on the group

with wet eyes and quivering lips 
only one manyou see him slightly advanced

from the othersgazes upon the miserable

men with an aspect cold stony and

unpitying as death he is by no means an

unhandsome man for his beard is dark and

silken his hair glossy as a ravens pinion

his eyes full and lustrous 
he gazes apon the prisoners and the urn

and smiles until his teeth glare out from beneath

his moustache 
have we seen this man before 
the colonel advances as if choking down

his emotions he surveys the group and speaks

the priest by his side with dark brown and

rotund face translates his words into english


 
texans taken prisoners in an attack

made by you last christmas day on the

town of mier situated in the republic of

mexico you were brought some months since

to this rancho on your way to the city of

mexico you rose on the guard shot and

stabbed our sentinels and escaped after

days and nights of starvation and misery

worse than death you were retaken and

again you stand upon the scene of your mad

adventures texans by the order of don

antonio lopez de santa anua president of

the republic you are declared pirates and

robbers out of the pale of all international

law and stripped of all the rights of civilized

communities you are worthy of death

in the most sudden and ignominious form

but
in mercy
there was a convulsive movement

in the brave colonels throat which

wellnigh choked his voicein mercy i

say the president decrees that only one out

of every ten men shall be put to death 
he pausedand as though embarrassed by his


emotions played for a moment with the hilt

of his sword you see his officers stand

weeping near yonder wall and still with his

uncovered brow glowing in the light of the

setting sun stands that solitary and unpitying

cavalier with the dark hair and silken beard 
within that urn are deposited one hundred

and seventy beans seventeen black

ones among one hundred and fiftythree white

ones you will advance two by two and

draw each of you from the urn a single

bean if it is white you liveblack and

you die before sunset 
he turned away and the texans looked

silently in each others faces the unpitying

officerdid we ever see him beforeadvanced

passed through the prisoners and

took his seat on the log the priest handed

him a large blank book with pen and ink

this man was to enter the names of the living

and the deadas one by one they raised

the deathurn 
the air seemed to grow more sultry and

a strange silence descended upon the scene 
while the colonel and his officers were

moved to tearswhile even the rough soldiers

wept as they grasped their muskets

while that solitary unpitying man seated by

the urn looked coolly in the faces of the

texans they advanced two by two and chained

as they were inserted every man his hand

in the urn of death 
the first couplea man with sinewy form

and hair like snow and a man whose robust

figure indicated the wreck of herculean

strength 
at once they inserted their hands there

was a pause sobs were heard from the

group of mexican officers the register of

the deadso let us c ll the handsome officer

who seated on the log holds the book

of life and deathcoolly watched their movements

as though he had wagered a few dollars

on the result 
the old man drew a black bean




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






death cried the register as he entered

his name on the book 
the old man whose features covered with

a snowwhite beard belied not one trace of

emotion whispered to his comrade 
should you ever return to texasi have

a daughteryou will bear to her my blessing

 
the herculean texan could not reply 
the manacles were loosened and the aged

man calmly stepped aside and stood erect on

the spot allotted to the doomed 
the horrible lottery went on in solemn silence

only broken by the sobs of the mexican

officersthe sneering laugh of the gallant

register who cried life or death

as though he was but marking the result of a

game of cards 
you may believe me that it was a sad

scene the sun never shone on a sight more

harrowing two by two they advanced these

heroes of mier who had mothers wives sisters

in the sunny land which they had bought

with their bloodthe beautiful land of texas 
not a groan from their lipsno not even

a sigh half naked unshaven and miserable

to look upon they came two by two to

the urn raised their faces in the sunset glare

and calmly took their places in the ranks of

life and death 
at last when the setting sun trembled on

the hilltop his red disc seen between the

cliff and the black cloud above there stood

sixteen men side by side on the spot assigned

to the condemned 
two texans only remained to fulfill the

conditions of the lottery there was but one

black bean in the urn and one of the twain

must die 
every eye was fixed upon them as they advanced


 
you see the tallest of the two a man of

sinewy form and aquiline face his broad

chest quivers beneath its covering of rags

ah unmanly spectaclethere are tears in

his large dark eyes 


why these tearsfor himself look at

the prisoner chained to his wrist and answer 
a very boy scarce sixteen with a girlish

form and smooth beardless cheek and

strangely lustrous blue eyes his face too

is worn by famine but there is a calm almost

holy light upon his soft features he looks

up into the face of the robust man and a sad

smile wreathes his lips 
fear not for me brotherill not play the

coward he says in a distinct firm tone 
fear not for
you
 and a hoarse groan

swelled the broad chest of the bearded texan

by i swear i do not fear for you you

shall not die nono that would be a little

too hard for the devil himself to think

hark ye harrythis in a hasty whisper

let me draw first the black bean is smaller

than the whitei can tell one from the other

by the touch i will 
the younger brother replied by thrusting

his hand into the urn 
there was one groan thrilling from every

lip in the courtyard the chivalric register

alone regarded the scene with a pleasant

smile and politely asked 
the color of the bean 

black
 cried the heroic boy turning

with a triumphant smile to his brother that

brother wrung his manacled hands and bowed

his head upon his breastit would have made

your blood run cold to see that strong man

weeping like a child 
name added the polite register smoothing

his silken moustache 

harry grywin
 replied the boy in a

firm tone 
the register started his face became pale

almost livid for an instant but recovering his

composure he coolly entered the name murmuring

harry grywin
death
 
this scene did not pass unobserved no

the doomed sixteen men saw it the mexican

officers shuddered as they beheld the black

bean in the hands of the girlish boy and ten





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



texans stepped from the ranks of the living

exclaiming incoherently 
i will take his placeby you cannot

kill that boybehold us we will die

in his stead 
but a voice deeper than all rung through

the court yard 
who talks of dying for harry grywin

when his brother i john grywin am here

look you he is but a childyou cannot put

him to death the foolish boy saw the bean

before he drew ithe denied himself the

shadow of a chance take me 
his tall form swelled in every fibre as he

towered erect the red glow of the setting sun

lighting up his aquiline features framed in

masses of hair and beard as black as jet 
take look you my mexican friends

i do not owe you much love i have cut and

carved you in battle as i would cut and carve

again had i free field and a good knife but

now i will stoop to you kneel to you come

priest tell it to them in spanish only so that

you will let me die in place of harry here

for as theres a god he looks the very image

of his mother 
the tones of that strong man his tears his

gestures had a language which went like a

fiery arrow to every heart 
this must not go on shouted the veteran

colonel rushing forwardthese men shall

not die and the boy holy trinity it would

be sacrilege to kill him 
the register sprang upon the log with his

fine form and handsome face revealed against

the sunset sky 
fall back colonel i command here he

said quietly waving his hand 
but your excellencydon antonio marin

 
at that name john grywin looked up and

surveyed the handsome form of the register

don antonio marin it was horrible to remark

the strange pallor of the texans face

the iron impression of his bearded lips 


don antonio marin he exclaimedoh

sir i am glad to know you 
separate these heretics shouted don antonio

with rapid utterance and violent gestures

quick i say the sun is setting and

it must be over before he is below the horizon

soldiers advance by platoons to your

dutypresentfire 
it was done like a lightning flash harry

was separated from the brothers side hurried

away into the ranks of the doomed there

was a report like separate claps of thunder

mingling in one awful peal and a mass of

blueish smoke rolled over the scene 
groans prayers lowmuttered curses mingling

in chorus do you see the smokeshroud

roll aside for a moment that old man on

his knees lifting his hands in prayer the

red blaze pours into his face and the smokecloud

rolls over them all peal on peal volley

on volley and now the whole courtyard is

veiled in smoke 
an awful silence 
the smoke slowly rolls aside ah those

mangled forms with here and there a limb

quivering with the last impulse of life a hand

raised but to fall stiff and frozen to the

ground a face uplifted with the blood pouring

over the hollow stomach which but a moment

ago were eyes 
there on the log beside the fatal urn

stands don antonio marin gazing coolly on

the bloody heap of dying and dead while his

curling hair and silked beard and smooth

olive cheek glow richly in the sun as he

lights a cigareto and emits volumes of perfumed

smoke from his vermillion lips 
near him john grywin frozen into a dead

stupor his hands clasped and his vacant gaze

rolling from the mangled forms to the soldiers

and last of all resting on that prominent

figure 
don antonio standing on the log and puffing

his cigareto with infinite relish his face

and beard encircled by clouds of fragrant

smokeas the sun dips below the horizon

and night rushes on the scene

texan mss






the
white arm of a woman thrust through

the staples of that massive door with the

iron pressed against the delicate flesh supplied

the place of a bolt and held the panels

firm 
it was a fearful thing to behold that arm

quivering and almost crushed by the sturdy

blows which fell against the opposite side of

the door and yet the arm was firm pressed

by the heavy panels of the door against the

rusted staples into which it was inserted it

trembled like a withered reed the small fingers

straightened with intense agony the

skin was rent by the overwhelming pressure

but still it was therethe only bolt of the

ironbound door 
the scene was a narrow room with a

lofty ceiling and floor of dark grey stone

from the tapestry on either side marked with

the figures the portraits of grave hidalgos

encircled by heavy frames and manifesting

in their steel armor their bearded

faces and helmetted brows distinct traces of

the age of chivalry frowned gloomily on that

brave and lonely woman 
the only light which imparted its faint


glow to the place wrs a small lamp uplifted in

the left arm of the maiden her right arm

was inserted in the place of a bolt for

some two or three feet around her the rays of

the lamp fell warm and glaring beyond that

circle of light in which she stood all was

gloom and the extreme end of the apartment

was enveloped in thick darkness 
for a single moment all is still as death

while this dead silence broods on the place

while the thick darkness hangs over its distant

extreme and the faces of warrior spaniards

frown from the tapestried walls we will gaze

upon this brave yet delicate girl 
her halfnaked form is pressed quiveringly

against the dark mahogany panels that massive

door supplies a black background to the

lithe outlines of her shape and strongly relieves

the alabaster whiteness of her shoulders

her feet her arms and bosom 
a solitary garment hastily gathered around

her waist falls in careless and loosening folds

to the floor her young bosom heaves freely

in the light you may trace the agitation

which swells her heart to bursting in the almost

imperceptible quivering of the nostril

you may read it in that silent compression of

the warm red lips it brightens wildly in

those dark eyes dilating in their sockets and

gleaming a steady lustre from the shadow of

the long black lashes 
a single vein swoollen as though it was

about to burst shoots upward from her brows

and mars the pale beauty of her forehead 
her hairthere is not a breath to stir it into





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



motionfalls in one mass of glossy blackness

over her right shoulder 
her form is neither tall nor masculine

she trembles before us one of that diminutive

shapes which supply in grace and lightness

what they lack in height and majesty a

slender form yet blooming freshly in the full

bosom warm almost voluptuous in the flowing

outline of the broad shoulders and rounded

arms beautiful in the stainless whiteness

of her small feet and hands wild and flashing

with the light of large deep eyes that seem to

burn as they dilate altogether one of those

small yet impetuous daughters of the south

who resemble the tigers in their stealthy tread

and not in each movement only but also in

their love and their revenge 
what means this picture framed by the

darkmahogany panels of the massive door

this solitary room gloomy with tapestry and

moth eaten portraits floored with stone and

with a single doorway at either extreme

the white arm thrust through the iron staples

the enlarging eye and bared bosom throbbing

with deathlike emotion 
wherefore with a picture so mysterious

and yet so beautiful in its very danger and

mystery commence this new in this legend

of the golden and bloody land 
from this dim room faintly illumined by

the lamp that quivers in the uplifted arm of

the maiden we will go forth on our pilgrimage

through the dusky battlegods and sepulceres

of mexico it is in the home that the

bolt of war descends in its most terrible glare

and reaps its most precious harvest of blood

in the home we will raise the curtain and

lay bare the awful theatre of revenge over

whose bloodstained bounds glide the phantoms

of human passion 
hark this silence so deathlike is broken

by the sound of repeated blows hurled against

the opposite side of the door deep voices

are heard in the interval between each

blow 


open sister your brother demands entrance

into this chamber 
open isora it is your betrothed that

calls 
one quick and intense glance toward yonder

door almost hidden in the gloomit is

the door of her bed chamber and the girl silently

withdrew her arm the blood starts

from the white skin and a livid streak deforms

its alabaster loveliness 
the door swings slowly into the room

two figures are disclosed halfadvanced from

the shadows of the doorway a monk and a

soldier the monk with his pale face sunken

on his folded arms the soldier with an unsheathed

sword gleaming in the light 
sister said the monk in a voice at once

sad and reproachful this dishonor is too

great to be borne an americanaye a

heretic a spy is discovered at dead of night

in the streets of vera cruz he is pursued

by mexicans his accursed life is in their

power and lo a mexican girl the orphan

child of don antonio marin gives shelter to

this spya shelter in the home of her dead

father shelter in the secresy of her bedchamber

 
where is he hissed the soldier as his

bearded face and tinselled form were disclosed

in the light this sword shall anticipate

the vengeance of the gibbet 
the halfnaked girl stood like a thing of

marble the light raised in her uplifted arm 
silently she gazed with her large eyes on

her brother and her betrothed 
that brother a man of some thirty years

whose pale and beardless face stood out distinctly

from the long and flowing robe of his

order there was a silent scorn about his

colorless lip an agony of shame in the

glance of his eyes as they dilated in his deathlike

face 
by his side his drawn sword grasped in a

firm hand stood the soldier quivering with

silent rage clad in a green uniform spangled

with ornaments of every shape and device





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



his w de trowsers glittering with gold lace a

pistol in his belt and his small eyes twinkling

from a mass of dark hair and beard he

presented an effective contrast to the pale

face and sombre attire of the monk 
brother replied the girl in a tone that

was firm in its very tremulousness it is

false there is no spy here yonder is my

bedchamber search it 
her red lip curled in quiet scorn and with

her bloodstained arm she silently lifted her

loosened robe upon her bosom blushing like

a beautiful sunset in that action of maidenly

modesty 
but we saw him enter vociferated the

soldier we traced him along the corridor

aye to this very room he is here and

his life is ours 
you should have seen the girl turn the silent

scorn of her large dark eyes upon his

face 
it is don augustin then who enters like

a robber at dead of night the bed chamber of

his betrothed my brother may hold himself

excused he is but a monk and knows but

little of the respect due a woman a maiden

but you the soldier the cavalier the gallant

o chivalric don augustin 
her lip curling her head thrown back she

flashed the light of her dark eyes upon his

lowering visage 
his head drooped the point of his sword

touched the floor the scorn of that halfclad

and lonely maiden cut him to the very

quick 
meanwhile the monk with his arms folded

his head sunkenregarded his sister with a silent

look long searching and full of

agony 
we traced the spy to this apartment he

said in a voice that scarcely rose above a

whisper there is but one door besides

this through which we have entered the

other door is yonder and it leads into your

bed chamber sister we will reach that

room 


what means that head turned hurriedly

over her shoulder that glance toward the

distant door does the maiden fear the

search 
her face was very pale as she turned once

more and with flashing eyes besought her

brother not to profane with his midnight intrusion

the sanctity of her chamber and her

couch 
the monk stood silent and confusedashamed

to advance and unwilling to recede

but the tinselled don augustin sprang forward

sword in hand toward the door of her

bedroom 
with one sudden and impetuous bound

that slender girl darted before him and shield

ed the door with her outspread arms she

shone very beautiful in the action again the

dark robe fell and with the darker hair relieved

the soft loveliness of her virgin

breast 
back it is not for
you
to enter here 
and as the flash of her indignant eyes met

his cowering gaze he started back ashamed

of the meanness of his purpose 
brother advance it is for you to commit

this outrage alone 
slowly ds though every step was clogged

with a leaden weight the brother advanced

and laid his hands upon the dark panels of

the door 
why do you hesitate said the maiden

as her bosom throbbed in long and deep pulsations

are you afraid 
her words were brave but pallor of her

face the unnatural brightness of her eyes

told the story of her intense agony 
it was a picture to live upon the memory

forever 
the room so dark and the dusks faces

frowning from the tapestried wall these three

figures near the doorwaythe maiden with

her bared bosom and uplifted light shining

down upon her pale face the monk with

one foot advanced one hand laid upon the

panels the soldier with his head bowed his





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



sword lowered gazing with upturned eyes

upon the sister and the brother his chest

heaving with suspense 
the strong light upon these figures and the

gloom all aroundit was a most impressive

scene and a silence like the grave added

awe to that moment of anxious hesitatation


 
i will enter said the monk 
he pushed open the door and disappeared

at the same moment the sister sank on her

knees while a groan of intense agony swelled

her bosom yes with her hair falling

over her face she covered her eyes with one

hand and the other grasping the light drooped

by her side 
don augustin like a statue of surprise

stood as if chained to the floor gazing in

mute horror upon the kneeling woman he

was a soldier and had done brave work in

many a battle done hideous butchery in many

a memorable texan field but now the damps

of fear started from his cold forehead he

was afraid 
he listened to the sound of footsteps within

that chamber he heard a deeptoned ejaculation

and then all was dead silence the

sword of don augustin shook as the tremor

of his arm agitated the gilded hilt 
thou art false isora he whispered as

his parting lips disclosed his white teeth firmly

set together 
she did not raise her head cowering on

the floor her robe her hair mingled in wild

disorder she pressed her left hand against her

forehead and laid her head against the panels

of her chamber door 
and thus they kept their fearful watch

the maiden and her plighted husband she

the orphan child of an honored race of old

castile now trembling in fear and shame as

her brother searched her chamber he a

brave and cruel soldier quivering in fear of

that dishonor which seemed glaring in his

face from the sombre panelling of the fatal

door 


within the chamber 
we will follow the footsteps of the monk 
he entered and the sanctity of his sisters

bed room lay open to his gaze it was a cool

and quiet place hung with faint crimson curtains

a single window opening on a garden

to the north a solitary light placed in a niche

before an image of the virgin mary the perfume

of flowers imparted a delicious sweetness

to the sultry air beautiful in their rainbow

hues they were clustered in a vase near

the window in one corner stood the maids

couch yet bearing the outlines of her shape

on its silken pillows 
the monk advancedtrembling he took

the light and searched the room there was

no one there all was silent and deserted

that light fell over the bed revealed the

folds of the silken hangings the flowers by

the window and the virgin smiling from the

recess but it did not disclose the form of a

living thing 
the spy is not here he gasped and approached

the window he cannot have escaped

in this way the leap were certain

death 
he looked down into the garden where

flowers and shrubbery were grouped in a

wilderness of perfume and then through the

interval of the vines which clustered round

the window frame he saw the mild sad light

of the stars 
this is strange he murmured as he approached

the image of the virgin as i live

he entered this room and yet i can discern no

trace of his footsteps 
as he spoke a dim distant murmuring

sound like the tramp of ten thousand men on

a sandy shore came through the thick walls

of that ancient mansion the monk groaned

as he bit his lips in impotent rage 

they
come the heretics the invaders 
but what is the sight that fixes the glance

of his burning eyes the statue of the virgin

has been moved from its place in the recess

the monk remembers the oldtime





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



legends of his paternal mansion and at a glance

discovers the entrance to that secret stairway

leading from the bedchamber to the

roof 
ah he groaned with an oath in pure

castilian i have tracked the wolf to his

lair 
it was the work of second to spring forward

through that holy image open wide the narrow

door and glide into the darkness of the

secret stairway 
ten steps upwardsteps of stone built in

the thickness of the wallsand he stood upon

the flat roof amid the battlemented walls of

the mansion with the light of the stars upon

his brow 
a hand was laid upon his arm the stern

stern gripe of these iron fingers forced an involuntary

murmur of pain 
fiercely the monk turned his lip compressed

his brow scowlingit was his impulse to

hurl the intruder from the roof 
but the scowl passed from his brow ere he

drew another breath his lips parted the indignant

flash of his eye was succeeded by a

vacant stare 


he felt his blood curdle in his veins for

there in the pale light of the stars rose a tall

form swelled to gigantic proportions by the

gloom and a voice low and deep which thrilled

to the inmost heart of the monk whisperee

these words 
remember the
rancho saldo
 and look

yonder 
while that deathlike clasp tightened on his

arm the monk recognized the voice and

trembled like a frightened child before the

spectre of some goblin story 
quivering with a fear more terrible to behold

because its source is unknown to us the

monk beheld the sight which spread before

him 
it was a sight to swell the heart with a

vague yet overwhelming sense of the sublime


 
let us stand beside him on the roof of the

mansion which overlooks the main square of

the town and gaze upon the vision which he

beheld and feel its dusk sublimity rush thro

the eyesight to our souls

texan mss






above
 the sky of night that dome of deep

and tranquil blue shining with the gleam of

the stars beneath the town of vera cruz

its roofs and towers rising indistinctly in the

gloom with the grand plaza right before us

encircled by noble structures and the sandy

shore stretching as far as eye can see to the

norte and south in dreary barrenness 
yonder to the northeast above the waves

glooms the castle of san juan de ulloa a

dark pile rising sullenly into night with the

mexican flag waving from its loftiest tower

toward the east the waves break in low murmurs

against the barren isle of sacrificios barren

to the sight yet bearing in its bosom mysterious

chambers stored with relics of six

hundred years ago 
beyond the castle and the fort spreads the

illimitable waste of the trackless gulf a world

of waves reaching out into the vague night

until it kisses the world of sky 
landward we gaze beyond the waste of

sand and the dark line of forest and hill a

colossal mass white as snow towers serenely

into the western sky 
that white mass rising in its lone magnificence

from the distant horizon its sublime

summit rushing proudly into heaven is the

peak of orizaba the altar of this glorious


temple which has the waste of sand and forest

and the sweep of the vast ocean for its floor

the sky for its dome the stars of god for its

sacrificial lights 
it is one of those scenes which glide into

the soul and fill it with a sublimity that has no

speech no word escapes our lips no sudden

ejaculation give vent to our awe here we

gaze the ocean is before us the gloomy castle

rising from its wavesthere and orizaba

glares like the ghost of past ages from the

western sky 
for a moment we turn our gaze from the

ocean and the mount to the city that sleeps

before us that home of plague nestling on

the low and sandy shore called vera cruz 
the mansion on whose roof we stand lies

east of the plaza yonder to the west with

its front to the eastern sky towers the cathedral

a noble structure whose dome and cross

are lost to view in a vague mass of blackness

what means this blackness that seems to undulate

like a cloud as we gaze upon it that

dome is black with vultureslook upon

the cross rising high in the serene air crouches

the sentinel of the band an omen of death

and blood nestling upon the emblem of jesus

and peace 
he will have a brave feast ere many days

that gory vulture resting tonight on the highest

cross of vera cruz 
there on the south of the square rises another

church or mass of churches swarming

with buzzards black even to the cross with

those birds of death




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






ere a month has passed those churches

will be blasted into ruins the bodies of the

dead will darken their altars the vulture pick

his ghastly meal even in their most holy

places 
before us on the east of the square we behold

the national palace surmounted by the

tricolored flag of mexico 
and from this plaza shadowed in deep

night by those noble forms of architectural

grandeur extend the smoothpebbled streets

of vera cruz overhung with balconied windows

gay with manycolored awnings and

rendered uniform by a wide extent of level

roofs 
it is is indeed a beautiful town far out

on the sealike a gleam from italy or asia

the voyager beholds it with its towers and

cupolas rising from the waste of sand while

far above smiles the serene orizaba in the

calm evening hour when the white peak blushes

in the sun and the smile of the dying day is

upon wave castle and shore these balconies

are crowded with beautiful women whose

white fingers gleam through the intervals of

flowers while their gracefully gathered mantle

cannot altogether hide the glance of their

dark eyes the red warmth of their lips the

the passionate heaving of their veiled bosoms


 
and yet from this town so sublime with

its distant orizaba so beautiful with its warm

southern women its tropical flowers so grand

with tower and dome the plague every year

hurls two thousand people to their graves

one third of its houses are ravaged every

year by that pestilence which wings its deadliest

dart where the verdure is freshest the

sky most serene the flowers most beautiful 
tonight another a deadlier plague threatens

vera cruz 
what mean these batteries erected everywhere

about the city hemming its houses in

a wall of latent flame wherever you gaze

not an inch of ground beyond the walls of

the town but is commanded by some deadly


engine of war to the north you behold

fort conception to the left fort santiago

one mile from the city with a belt of water

between san juan de ulloa all formidable

with cannon all prepared for the hurricane

of hattle 
what foreign enemy will dare assail the

impregnable castle the city of the gulf defended

by a wall of steel by the invisible barrier

of the plague 
hark there is a strange sound to the

souththat waste of sand is black with shadowy

formsthe tread of ten thousand men

fills the air with a sound like the first moaning

of a thunder storm 
gaze upon the channel which glides between

the castle and the isle of sacrificios 
even as the light breeze crisps the waters

into tiny ripples we behold glooming through

the night the dark forms of ships of war

some white with sails some sending the

smoke of their steamengines into the starlit

sky the night is dark we may not trace

distinctly the shapes of these vessels nor

count their cannon nor estimate the awful

power of their death machinery but they are

there gently undulating upon the smooth waters

their decks black with warriors the banner

of the stars waving over all as if to flash

back unto heaven the smile of the cloudless

sky 
what means the banner of the stars floating

over the gulf of mexico 
look there are barges upon the waters

gliding as noiselessly as any gondola of venice

that bears the lover to his mistresss smile

gliding from the ships to the shore and bear

ing armed men to the plaguesmitten shore

of vera cruz 
does not the scene rivet your gazefill

your heart 
you see those boats extended in the form

of a crescent approach the sands while the

water breaks in foam around their prows

the bayonets twinkle like fireffies through the

darkness a vague murmur stealing over the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



waves swells along the shore like the hushed

whispers of ten thousand men 
they come on those deathboats bearing

many a true heart to the hideous grave of the

pestilence they grate upon the pebbly beach

there is a flag waving through the gloom and

the forms of armed men start into view far

along that drear that barren shore 
where is now the thunder of san juan de

ulloa lookthat slight elevation of sand

commands the shore a single cannon planted

there would hurl a thousand men back into

the waves and redden with blood the ripples

as they gurgled over these mangled falls 
is there not one truehearted mexican

only one to place the cannon and fling the

lighted match to his fatal work not one 
for there is a doom upon the land the hardy

children of the north are here the soldiers

of the new crusade throng the waters

and the shore at least twelve thousand strong

and there is not one mexican to meet them

on the beach with the warm welcome of a

warriors steel 
at sunset you should have beheld the scene

for if it is impressive now at sunset it was

most beautiful 
it was a calm afternoon on the ninth of

march the glow of sunset was upon

the waveless waters of the mexican gulf

upon the city of vera cruz with its roofs

and towers centred on the sandy shore upon

the dark castle glowing to the north and

those beams so vivid in their tropical glare

hung in a baptism of life around the faroff

peak of
orizbaa
 
there in that sweet sad calm of the

evening breeze which makes the stranger

in a foreign land dream of home a strange

sight was seen by the light of the setting

sun 
the roofs of vera cruz were black with

people the soldier sprung to the battlement

and held his breath as he gazed from

yonder castle the gay group of mexican

generals looked forth upon the tranquil wa


ters every eye was centred upon the channel

between the castle and sacrificios and

every heart beat quicker at the splendid panorama

warmed by the sunset rays 
for the huge princeton came gliding over

the waves urged swiftly on by her tremendous

machinery with the smoke curling over

her masts and melting into the serene gold

of the upper sky the dark form the white

sails of the other vessels swept black and

glittering in the centre she seemed that

fearful princeton renowned for the bloody

tragedy once enacted on her decks like the

head of a huge serpent trailing its sinuous

way over the calm waters 
as the fleet approached the isle of sacrificios

the armed men crowded on the decks

their weapons flashing in back the glare of

the sun cast their gaze to the west and saw

the desolate shore spreading wide and dreary

as the waves broke over its sands the city

crowded on its every roof with the men the

women the mothers and daughters of vera

cruz are therethe vessels of other nations

anchored in the harbor their masts alive with

silent spectators and in the distance
orizaba

seemed to woo them on
orizaba
 that soon

would see them hurled by hundreds into the

plaguepit or crushed in bloody heaps upon

the battle field 
in the shrouds of the steamer
massachusetts


at this moment of intense expectation

stands a man of some sixty years his form

unbent from its stern majesty by the toil of

battle or the frost of age clad in a costume

magnificent in its severe simplicity blue

relieved by golda broad chest heaves beneath

that uniform a kingly form supports

that warrior head his brow was bared you

could see the gray hairs curling round it the

sunset glow upon those firm features every

line glowing with a warrior soul 
over his head and around him throwing

his expressive form distinctly into view

waves in slow undulations the banner of the

stars




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






his eye brightening as it expands roves

over the scene and he remembers that bloody

field fought years ago within the thunder of

niarara and looks forward with a quickening

pulse to these words which history will soon

write in characters of light

winfield

scott in the footsteps of cortes

 
with twelve thousand men their lives

their honor hanging on his fiat this man of

niagara sees the american army approach

the land of mexico 
harkthe thunder of a signal cannon

breaks the silence a volume of blue cloud

sweeps over the form of scott 
that is the signal gun 
and parting from the vessels sides as they

swing at anchor near the isle a line of barges

crowded with soldiers sweep toward the shore

it is a beautiful thing to see them come

spread forth in the form of a crescent which

flings the glitter of four thousand bayonets

over the waves 
on towards the sandsnearer and nearer

in sight of the city and the fort the object

of the gaze of thousands these veterans of

monterey these men of louisiana and kentucy

approach the hostile shore 
that form standing erect in the foremost

barge with the light playing upon the muscular

chest the uniform of blue glittering with

gold the deep eye gleaming beneath the

waving plumes as white as snow 
over all he towers the american flag

grasped in one hand the unsheathed sword

flashing in the other behind him the fleet

before him the shore far above the white

altar orizaba 
look upon that banner and read in its

bloodstained folds the single word monterey

 gaze upon that waving plume it

gleamed like a beacon through the three days

fight of the mountain city it waves above

the brow of
worth
 whose eye flashes again

as he prepares to spring from the barge and

plant the banner upon the sands of mexico 
silence reign only broken by the sweep of


the oars now hearts are beating impetuously

beneath their warrior covering the setting

sun shines over compressed lips and woven

brows a moment of fearful suspense 
nearer to the shore glides the toremost

barge 
you see worth lift at once his sword and

banner with one hurried glance he surveys

the hostile beachthe city five miles distant

the harbor white with sails and then casting

his face so chivalric in its ripe manhood to

the glow of the setting sun he springs upon

the shore 
in silence he plants the banner staff upon

the sands and uncovers his brow 
ten thousand eyes behold the picture 
that solitary soldier standing alone upon

the beach the waves curling at his feet the

banner of the continent waving over his head

the golden sands relieve his form the evening

breeze lifts the banner into light 
then and not till then the ominous silence

is broken by a thunder shout it is the heartwarm

cheer of our thousand brave men look

upon them as they come with one impulse

they plunge into the waves and dash onward

lifting their glittering arms into the light

they cannot wait until the barges grate the

sand but springing into the water midbreast

deep they hurry forward and encircle with

a guard of hearts and steel the noble form of

worth 
the last gleam of the setting sun disclosed

that barren shore clouded by the firm array

of six thousand men with the gloomy outlines

of cannon and mortar seen disitnctly

even amid the flash of these long belts of dazzling

steel 
darkness gathers on the ocean and the

shore one by one the prominent points of

the picture went out in the gloom first the

shore faded and the soldiers in their beautiful

array became a vague mass of moving

blackness their presence known by their

thunder tread alone the domes of the city





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



glittered for a moment and then were dark

the huge castle sank into the bosom of night

the ocean reached forth its waves and melted

through the dusky air into the distant horizon


 
and when the shadow was upon the ocean

and the shore like a mantle of tangible darkness

still in the west orizaba lifted its white

altar into heaven and while all was black below

the last rays of the departing day hung

round its glossy pinnacle like a smile from

god 
now it is dark night illumined only by the

stars while the american legions are hurrying

from the battle ships to the shore and

extending in silent and terrible arry around

the slumbering city our souls are hurried by

the stern emotions of the hour back into the

bosom of the dead ages 
three hundred years ago and the same

lone orizaba that towers serenely now

flashing its calm scorn upon the petty broils

of man smiling calmly on whether he

marches to battle in glittering array or sinks

disfigured and horrible into the loathsome pit

of the plaguethat same grizaba beheld a

far different scene 
then the great woods sent forth their arms

of foliage and flowers even to the ocean shore

the palm grew near the waters a straight

column towering into upper air with a coronal

of broad leaves and luscious fruit around

its brow the cypress too that stern monarch

of dead centuries rose here with all

manner of rainbow flowers blooming round

its massive trunk and vines of various beauty

hanging about its branches then the desert

sand where san juan de ulloa glooms was a

fair green isle sacrificios yonder was the

temple isle of a strange and mysterious religion

upon its sands among the gay glory

of the tropical vegetation the horrible altars

rose dripping with the warm blood of the human

sacrifice beneath its surface were

chambers reared in the barbarous yet im


pressive architecture of the people whose

name has for thousands of years been lost to

human lips 
wonderful chambers were those hidden

beneath the sand gloomy with images of the

devil god and burrowing far into the caverns

beneath the ocean waves 
then it is of the time three hundred years

ago we speak a wondrous people dwelt in

this land amid gorgeous cities or in the silence

of the beautiful vallies their dusky

faces glowing with the same passions that fill

our bosoms now the fury of war the avaricious

lust of traffic the magnetic tenderness

of love 
yes beside this shore many a great lord

clad in garments that were woven with feathers

of rainbow dyes and dazzling with ornaments

of solid gold strode proudly along

followed by the innumerable column of his

halfnaked and dusky warriors yes beneath

yonder cypress in those days that are now

almost forgotten crouched the darkcheeked

but impetuous daughter of the south looking

with her large deep eyes upon the brown

child that slept upon her bosom yes upon

yonder isle the chaunt of prayer was heard

the altar smoke arose the yell of the victim

forced to the altar his heart torn from his

living bodyshrieked in horrible cadence

upon the still air and died far along upon

the waves 
the ruler of this land dwelt in a valley

some hundred of miles to the west in a tranquil

valley of blossoms whose gardens and

lakes were guarded by volcanic mountains 
at once the high priest of the awful religion

and the emperor of the people he was

called the sad warrior or in the aztec

language
montezuma
 
wherefore called the sad or doomed warrior

it is a strange story and i will speak

it in few words 
the religion of this vast people which

raised its altars in every city and sent its





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



sacrificial flames into the sky from every

mountain comprised the worship of two deities

like all the religions or rather forms of religion in the world it adored two godsa

god of blood a god of peace 
the god of blood in some lands demanded

the offerings of an lnquisition pledged to

do the works of hell on earth on the victims

of persesution slain without mercy on the

battle fields of bigotry 
in mexico this god of blood demanded

merely the palpitating heart of a solitary victim

who was stretched upon the altar stone

amid the gaze of thousands and torn to death

with his livid brow crowned with blossoms

this victim was slain on stated occasions of

solemn ceremonial not in the gloomy hall of

an inquisitions dungeon nor in the molocksacrifice

of a genevan stake 
in all lands of the world the god of peace

received the worship of the purest hearts

the brutal man swayed by the bigots lust

into hellish frenzy loved him not but his

name was written in serene skies in waveless

lakes in all that was tender and beautiful

in the world as much in the bared beauty of

a stainless womans bosom as in the lone majesty

of the mountain top smiling in the last

gleam of an unclouded sun 
after ages of darkness this god was clearly

written in the biblehe shone an image

of time joined to eternity in the serene

jesus
 
in the land of mexico three hundred years

ago this godonly revealed to the aztec


people in the language of external nature or

the voiceless eloquence of the heartwas

seen in the blossoms in the cloudless skies

in all the tenderness and sanctity that whispers

in the syllable
home
 
it their traditions which called him
quetzalcoatt


it was taught that he had lived in

the mexican land some thousand years before

that he had been banished in his

golden reign of peace and driven from this

very shore by the god of blood 
but a glorious hope lived in their traditions

that he would return and bless the land again

nnd reign the messiah of the heart 
in this hope lived montezuma but priest

and king as he was of a despotic government

and a barbarous religion the hope soon became

to him a nightmare fear he looked for

the return of the good god with trembling

and saw the coming of the blessed age with

the terror of selfconvicted guilt 
he was doomed to destruction from his

birth by prophecy and the coming of the

blessed quetzalcoatt was to ripen his doom

into judgement therefore from his birth

he was called montezuma or the doomed

man 
did the messiah come 
yes but not the god peace nor the apostle

of the god of peace but a stern messiah

whose crucifix was the hilt of his sword

whose black banner bore a red csoss with

the words
in this sign we conquer
 
a single picture from the life of this messiah

of blood

texan mss






upon
the sandy shore a white tent arose

shadowed by the deepgreen leaves of a cypress

tree 
around that tent were grouped a band of

warriors attired in linked steel their bearded

faces surmounted by iron helmets an iron

sword in each sinewy hand a deep murmur

thrilled through the group and the last gleam

of the fading light revealed the various passions

anger despair hopecontending for

the mastery in every warriors face 
while they surrounded the tent flinging

their mailed hands in fierce gesticulations in

the air the light of sunset mellowed the waveless

ocean and the waters melted without a

sound upon the pebbled shore 
around was the glowing panorama of fruit

and flowers from the thickly clustered foliage

the purple grape the fragrant fig the

golden orange were seen while over all

arose the melancholy palm so lone in its majesty

the strong cypress so big in every

inch of its rugged bark with the history of

ast years 


and over all far away to the west the

cloudless blue of the evening sky was broken

by a colossal mass white as sunless

snow 
it was a wild and yet a beautiful scene

that group of warriors beared from the

mouth to the throat and clad in mail of iron

clustered about the white tent their warhorses

also ironclad standing near the

golded sand stretching far to the north and

south to the east the ocean vast calm and

trackless in the west the serene peak of

orizaba 
attracted by the sound of those earnest

voices speaking deeply in pure castilian

we enter the group and start back wondering

and dumb as we behold the two figures that

form the centre of the circle 
a man of thirtythree years clad in glittering

steel armor his form at once agile

and athletic is seated there upon a rock his

helmet laid aside his hands clasping that

sword whose hilt pierces the sand 
a face high and bold in the forehead

thoughtful almost sad with the light of those

eyes so unnaturally large and dark firm in

the silent compression of the bearded lip

altogether the face of an enthusiast and a

warrior were it not for the air of practical

energy which invests the face we should say

at the first glance that we beheld in that

mailclad man a dreamer cased in armor instead

of a cowl 
while all are moved by the tempest of





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



passion he alone is calm yes while the monk

at the right surveys the group and clasps his

crucifix in prayer while the splendid warrior

on the left whose battlesteel shines with

drops of gold seizes his sword and with a

scornful lip confronts the group this man

with the uncovered brow is firm and colds a

marble 
the ships which bore us to this accursed

land
you
have destroyed shouted an athletic

man whose dogged features halfhidden

in his hair and beard announce a reckless

nature by the holy trinity we are here

in a heathen land at the mercy of the savages

our bones will bleach upon their altars before

many days 
and a chorus of fierce ejaculations disturbs

the silence of the evening hour 
pity us mother of god we shall never

see castile again 
never our ships torn to pieces rot

beneath yonder wave the madness of this

man hath undone us all 
conquer a nation like this a nation of

millions ruled by a great king it is madness

to think it 
the man with the uncovered brow heard

it all with his large eyes fixed upon the sand

not a word passed his lips 
back shouted the splendid knight who

with drawd sword stood by him dare you

menace the captain 
for the love of god my children be calm

besought the priest lifting into light the holy

cross 
by this time you have doubtless discovered

that the name of the priest was
olmedo


the splendid knight
alvarado
these

mailed forms the adventurous spaniards who

landed a few days since on this unknown

shore the central figure so calm while all

around is storm
hernan cortes
 
he has destroyed their ships they cannot

go backthe ocean is between them and

home before them the wonderous land of

montezuma swarming with its millions of


people and glorious with its unmeasured

stores of gold this man cortes not long

ago an obscure planter of cuba has sworn

with this little band to conquer the empire of

montezuma 
it is indeed madness 
at last he lifts his eyes and surveys the angry

group you see the madness of his

dream in the deep flush which reddens his

cheek in the unnatural glare of his eye

that flush that glare says more to the warriors

than a thousand words for they tell us

that the soul of this man is up within him

that alone he will accomplish this deed if

not a single arm moves with him 
he rises lays his left hand upon the banner

staffabove him the gonfalon of black velvet

with its red cross and with his right he

raises the blade or his sword slowly over his

head 
be it so his deep indignant voice is

heard exclaim you all desert me i will

go alone 
silence the genius flashing from this

mans eyes begins its work upon every heart

silence hesitation suspense 
there is a land to conquerit is yonder

he pointed to the setting sunthere is

gold to winit is there there are millions

of heathen whom we can convert to the true

cross they too are there you are afraid

to conquer convert or winafraidyou

desert me it is a crime that i have destroyed

your ships i am guilty i confess it

take your way where you will as for me

with this sword in my hand this banner over

my head i will cry to god and his saints and

go forth to conquer alone 
the silence deepens heads are drooped

upraised arms sink with their swords with

wondering eyes they gaze upon the form of

cortes 
alvardo so splendid in his knightly array

advances silently to his side 
not
alone
for i am with you




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






and i exclaims the priest olmed advancing

from the other side 
and i exclaims a soft low musical

voice in castilian broken by a strange accent

it echoes from the tent and pierces

every heart 
two white arms are wound around the

neck of cortes and pillowed on his right

shoulder is seen a warm face framed in flowing

hair and lighted by large eyes that burn

with the religion the love of a true woman 
who is this beautiful woman from whose

brown cheeks glows the ripeness of fiery

blood so queenly is her form so voluptuous

in every out lineher young limbs trembling

beneath a robe of spotless whiteso

like a passionate woman in her ripe lips so

like a spirit in her large eloquent eyes 
every spaniard knows her at a glance the

child of the heathen people he has forsaken

home and altar for the christian she has

linked her fate with cortes saying to him in

the beautiful language of the hebrew maiden

to naomiwherever thou goest i will go


thy people shall be my peoplethy god my

god 
now spreading forth her arms she looks

upon the stern soldiers with that glance so

sublime with womans faith and utters the

broken words 
i too will go 
had you turned your eyes for a moment

from this group and then looked again you

would have seen the sand crowded qy kneeling

men their eyes gleaming with the frenzy

of enthnsiasm their swords lifted towards the

holy banner their voices joining in the shout

mexico and montezumal lead us on

we will conquer with you cortes or with you

cortes we will die 
orizaba glowed in the setting sun and the

indian maiden mariana held over the dark

hair of cortes a crown of orange blossoms

with a single bloodred flower in the centre

as the night sank over the scene she fluttered

it gently in the air and it sank like a good

omen on his brow













the avenger of a threefold wrong







 
 






				 
				
				
			







			 
				
				 
 

				







whenever he tried to pray one word written

in letters of fire glared between him

and god
remorse






texam mss





remember
the
rancho salado
and look

yonder 
that voice we say curdled the blood of

the monk 
there beside him on the rooftop of the

old mansion of vera cruz rose a sombre

figure which in the dim light of the stars

resembled a phantom rather than a man 
it was some moments ere the monk could

gather nerve to raise his eyes and look upon

the shadowy form at first he saw only a

tall figure attired in grey with a rifle in his

hand a pale face encircled by masses of

dark hair with a long black beard clothing

the lower part of the visage and descending

to the broad chest 
then as he saw more clearly he beheld

that white forehead the dark eyebrows the

aquiline nose firm mouthcurving with a

smile that was almost satanticand a rounded

chin appearing from masses of black

beard a frock coat of grey hues edged on

the skirts with dark fur and girded by a belt

of black leather displayed the sinewy proportions

of the stranger over his white brow

arose a cap of dark fur with a single

long and slender feather quivering in its

front 


you tremble
father pedro
the voice

sounded like a deathknell to the monk

and yet there is no reason to fear come

while the stars gleam above us while san

juan frowns yonder and the tramp of ten

thousand heretics resound from the sandy

beach come i say sit by me on the battlements

and let me tell you a storyan amusing

story as there is a god do not wonder

that i speak spanish with such a glib tongue

i learned the language in an excellent

grammar schoolrather rough it may be

but still excellentthe castleprison of perote

 
father pedro sank backward on the battlement

his hands hanging motionless by his

side he trembled as with an ague chill

but then the air was so cold 
taking his seat beside the monk and resting

one arm on his rifle the stranger began

his story 
did you ever father pedro in your

priestly wanderings behold a picture like

this a lonely rancho centered in a valley

of barren hills and illumined on every stone

with the dusky glow of a clouded sunset in

the courtyard of that rancho a handsome soldier

standing on a log shrieks to his bloodhounds

and bids them put to death seventeen

men rebel texans who await their fate near

the walla boy mark ye a smoothfaced

girlish boy standing in their midst there

is a crash father pedro a smoke and horrible

groans rise from that heap of palpitating

forms which writhe struggle and die even





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



on the spot where a moment since stood

seventeen living men not a mexican eye

but is wet with tears not a soldier but pities

the miserable men who are butchered thus

in cold blood yes there is one cold

relentless unpitying while all are weeping

round him stands that handsome officer don

antonio marin 
the monk shuddered 
but near the gallant officer is seen the

brother of the smoothcheeked boy waiting

until the smoke clears away so that he may

recognize the mangled form of harry grywin

that brother is a strong man father

pedro yet he bites his lip until the blood

comesweeps o every one of his tears is

worth a mexicans life and all the while the

handsome officer stands smiling at his agony

come man you are dullwhy dont you

laugh when the smoke clears away john

the elder brother advances searches for his

girlish brothers body there are sixteen

carcasses on the sod but harrys is not

there 
you may see the head of the monk fall

slowly on his breast 
the scene changes to saltillo a beautiful

city some hundred miles and more from the

rancho salado two months have clapsed

since the handsome officer halloed his bloodhounds

to the slaughter it is a festival day in

saltillo the church lines the street with her

banners her crosses her glittering robes extending

in gorgeous procession above all

above the points of encircling bayonets shines

the host the body and blood of jesus

shrined in a golden cup but who comes

here along the streetsthis ghastly figure

clad in rags the face thinned by famine the

blue eyes hollow and ghastly it is a texan

aye the very boy who two months since was

doomed shot in the rancho salado he escaped

wandered among the mountains for

two months and now rushes into the ranks

of the procession screaming for bread for

water for you see he is maddened by


thirst and hunger like a hunted deer that

can drag its bloody trail no longer he turns to

his hunters and beseeches mercy bread

water behold the mercy which is given to

him a file of soldiers separate from the

procession at the command of their leader

a ghastly figure is kneeling in the centre of

the plaza the cathedral before him the host

gleaming above his head presentfire

there is a quivering mass of flesh and blood

on the stones of the street and the officer advances

contemplates the form of his victim

or to put it in plainer words don antonio

marin looks quietly and with his most winning

smile upon the mangled corse of that

boy of sixteen girlish harry grywin 
the monk lifted his eyes and muttered the

name of the holy trinity 
the voice of the stranger echoes clear and

deep through the silence of the nightit

pierces the soul of father pedro yet he dare

not gaze upon the eyes nor look upon the face

of the unknown man unknown 
look yonder monk 
so careless so conversational was the tone

of the strangers voice that the monk raised

his eyes 
yonder father pedro not upon the

starlit sky nor upon the dreary shore of sand

not yet the wooded hills but yonder to

the north west what is this that we behold

a texan home reared on an island knoll

some sixty miles from san antonio amid a

grove of oaks venerable with their waving

festoons of silver moss is it not beautiful

the fountain bubbling in the centre of the

grove the rich masses of sua and shade chasing

each other over the sod the world of

prairie and sky spreading around and above

that home of prairie eden a father and his

three children dwell there in the wilderness

the free canopy of god above them and the

breath of god hlowing freshly over the prairie

into their dear home of the blossoming

desert but mark ye father pedro the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



brothers are called away to san antonio called

with the laborers and slaves of the plantation

to defend the frontiers of texas from mexican

outrage they are gone only a few brief

hours warned by a supernatural messenger

they leave their men encamped and hasten

home they do return homebehold them

after journeying all night approach the island

grave in the dimness of the daybreak john

is mounted on his black horse harry on his

ambling bay and youll remember john was

a muscular man sure as death with his rifle

and harry a mere boy with such laughing

blue eyes that went right into his rude brothers

heart 
they are coming homealonefor they

have left their soldiers on the prairie thirty

miles away they are in sight of prairie

eden their horses have fallen but still they

hurry on how beautifully the morning sun

shines over the mansion with the oaks grouped

around it and the white moss quivering in

every breath of air coming home they

hear the sound of the fountain see the porch

ascend the knoll with a merry hurrah for

john begins to think that his presentiment

was falsethe words of that awful messenger

a lie but what is the sight that meets their

eyes as they reach the porch where is the

father to welcome the children home where

the sister to press her kiss upon her brothers

lips lookha ha the father hangs to

the tree before his own door his dead face

gilded by the morning sunthe sister crouched

in the porch a mad a
dishonored woman


 
the monk fell on his kneesmercy

for the sake of the holy trinity no more

no more 
but the brother even john bends over his

lost sister his namethe author of this

double wrong the doer of this devils work

hark that voice from the white lips of the

wrecked woman
don antonio marin
 
as he hissed the last words through his

compressed teeththe monk crouching all the


while before himthe stranger dashed his

rifle on the flat roof and beat his forehead

with his clenched hands the groan which

came from his lips was not human it resemled

the howls of a dying tiger 
you will confess father pedro that john

grywin and don antonio marin have a long

account to settle whenever they may chance

to meet you admit that even if john should

discover don antonio under the cowl of a

monk his chivalric name transformed into

father pedro that it would be a very amuing

thing for the said john to stab the good

father at dead of night and pitch his bloody

carcass over the battlements into the streets of

vera cruz this would be amusing i say

but very very far from just let me picture

a little piece of justice for you after the

lapse of long years john grywin finds don

antonio under the cowl of a monk his only

care the charge of a beautiful and orphaned

sister tho monk loves that sister adores

her even as john adored his sister yes the

monk wishes her to marry the chivalric don

augustin bestow her wealth on a convent

and live happily for long years encircled

by blooming children at this crisis of

her destiny john grywin comes to vera

cruz finds entrance into the home of the sister

and night after night setting by her side

with her soft hands within his own tells her

the movingsomewhat melancholystory of

his life and wins her heart forever in this

story mark you he leaves the names a blank

does not tell the voluptuous isora that the

name of the assassin and ravisher is don antonio

marin well after all his plans are

laid john grywin being still in pursuit of

justice brings the threads of destiny together

on the night of the th of march look

yonder father pedro behold the barren

isle of sacrificios there is the sepulchres

of the aztec race my bridal bed is waiting

for me now your sister is pure at this hour

when morning dawns she will repose in my





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



arms in yonder bridal bed sacrificedher

honor purity all offered up to the memory of

my sister come monk unfrock yourself

i want your cowl it will serve me as a disguise

to pass the guard or stayha ha

isora shall wear the monkish gown and i

will assume the handsome uniform of don

augustin 
the monk father pedro otherwise called

don antonio marin lay prostrate on the roof

prostrate and helpless as though a palsy

had possessed his once vigorous limbs his

eyes were rivetted on the face of the stranger

he suffered him to strip the gown from his

form saw him wind it about his form and for

a moment all was silence 
slowly heavily the monk raised himself

into a sitting posture the form of the stranger

was half lost to view in the aperture of

the stairway leading from the roof to the room

of isora 
that face framed in its dark hair and long

beard glared from its large eyes full in the

face of the monk 
one word before we part your turn

will come it is not yet time do you remember

walking some three months since just

before you assumed the cowl in the alameda

of mexico your whilehaired father on your

arm it was a beautiful evening the valley

of mexico glowed with its groves and spires

in living light while far above rose the volcanic

mountains sending their smoke like incenseclouds

into the evening sky and you

with your whitehaired father were walking

amid the blaze of rank and beauty which

floated along the alameda of the gay city

a bullet from an unknown source pierced

your fathers brain he fell at your feet his

white hairs bathed in blood whence came

that bullet you never could guess in remorse

for your crimes you deemed a vengeance

dealt by a supernatural hands and immediately

assumed the cowl ha ha it is

indeed amusingthat bullet came from the


rifle of the escaped prisoner john grywin

 
oh god my poor father 
thus one by one i will sweep your family

down to death first your father falls

tonight isora sinks in the embrace of pollution

last of all your turn will come yours

father pedro otherwise called don antonio

marin hero of the rancho salado hero of

the mass at saltillo hero of prairie eden 
he was gone 
it was some moments before the monk recovered

his consciousness he tottered to his

feet and the mild light of the stars shone over

his shaven face and revealed his broad forehead

and wildlyglaring eyes there was a

damp like death upon his brow he wiped it

away with his chilled hands but the cold

dross started forth again and bathed his clammy

flesh 
then gazing toward the ocean don antonio

contemplated with a shudder the dark

history of his life 
i thought it was but revenge when i dishonored

isabel and slew her brotherrevenge

for the scorn which the proud girl flung in my

teeth long years ago in her philadelphian

home but now my father murdered my

sister on the verge of dishonori learn at

last that the devil who urged me to my revenge

brings home to me the poison which i

distilled for others my sister she is pure

what harm has she done 
but isabel ho ho sir monk thou hast

forgotten the beautiful and sinless girl of the

prairie 
i will save her so aid me god and all

his saints 
with that trembling vow upon his lips he

rushed down the stairway and found himself

in the darkness of isoras chamber 
the door he tried it with the nervous

force of despair but it is fastened and the

echo of voices came through its thick panels







				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






he listenedthe voice of isora don

augustin and the avenger mingling in chorus

again the monk driven to frenzy tried

the door but his attempt was hopeless he

sank back upon the bed of isora and a hand


cold clammy was laid upon his own thrilling

his veins as with the touch of the dead 
fear not don antonie said a soft mild

voice for i isabel of prairie eden am with

you

texan mss






at
the same moment on the opposite side of

the door in the gloomy chamber frowning

with the portaits of castilian hidalgos don

augustin maddened by blind rage stood prepared

to plunge his sword into the heart of

his unknown enemy 
that enemy stood near the door his arms

folded over his rifle while a smile of cold

contempt played over his lips 
kneeling by his side the light held in her

extended armit seemed frozen into marble

lsora wound the dark robe around her breast

and looked with vacant terror into the face of

her betrothed husband her bosom now

stilled like death now heaving suddenly under

the dark robe her rich olive chek chilled

into a dull lifeless hue her eyes gleamng

a light at once vivid and unnaturalall

betokened the violence of the emotions which

threatened her reason with utter annihilation


 
indeed she seemed sinking fast into a stupor

a dull apathy worse than death 
calm and sneering john grywinhis cold


smile rendered sinister aye satanic by the

upward direction of the lightlooked into the

face of don augustin as though he would

read his soul through his small and restless

eyes 
heretic never do you leave this room

alive yon have poisoned the mind of this

pure lady

you have outraged the honor of a

you talk like a hero bravo i really

begin to admire you don augustin 
such was the reply of john grywin de

livered in a quiet tone his arms still folded

about his rifle not a muscle of his face

movednot one sign of agitation was visible

in his tall form or bold white forehead 
dog coward i spit on you 
don augustin grew grotesquely eloquent 
i say you are afraid to measure swords

with me i call you poltroomand scorn

you 
you are ungentlemanly don augustin

quietly remarked the texan now i have

but one word to say and that is to request the

loan of your coat for a few hours i wish to

pass the guard at the mole and to pass in

your uniform you understand will you

strip 
there was a sneering consciousness of superior

power not only physical but intellectual

force in his look and tone and yet don

augustin was not a man at all to be despised







				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






with an impetuous bound he hurled the

point of his sword at the unprotected beast of

the texan 
it was a deadly lunge a moment of quivering

suspense 
then occurred a sudden and sublime sacrifice


 
this woman isora kneeling on the floor

the light extended in her palsied hand was

only clad in the solitary robe which trembled

on her heart yet she did not remember

this nor call to mind that modesty which is the

most sudden instinct of a pure woman 
there was a wilder instinct in her breast

call it fascination magnetism love and it

taught her that the sharp point was hurled

against the texans heart that she must save

him at every hazard 
quick as the tigress maddened by the

slaughter of her young she darted from the

floor raised the light in one hand and with

the other flung the robe from her breast and

hurled it upon the point of don augustins

sword 
then panting and glowingher form brave

as the form of sinless eve she flung back her

head and with the eye flashing the nostril

quivering she entangled the sword and with

a sudden movement hurled it and her robe

together on the floor 
the light was still in her uplifted left arm

and in its beams she stood revealed glowing

from head to foot on bosom cheek and brow

with the fiery impulse of that heroic deed 
don augustin started back and shrieked

her name coupled with a word too foul for

manhood to repeat 
maddened as the texan was by the wrongs

which had goaded him for years until his

very life became one brooding revenge he felt

his blood boil at that unmanly word look

you see his clubbed rifle circle his head you

see don augustin hurled senseless to the

floor 
then the beautiful girl roused once more

into her womans modesty as the impulse of


her action passed away blushed in every

pore tossed her dark hair on her form it fell

it waved it streamed over her bosom and

down her limbs and sinking on her knees

wept aloud 
methinks i see some sensualist of the pulpit

or the press read this passage and as his

foul imagination ineapable of anything but

that which is born of the kennel of his own

heart covers this heroic deed with the atmosphere

of his sensualism and gravely groans

immoral damnable 
i write this scene first of all because it is

true and next as a defiance to those poor

earth worms who crawl over all that is pure

and beautiful in the earth of god leaving

their slime wherever they writhe along 
i paint this woman with the bared form

and look upon her unveiled loveliness blooming

in such roseate hues flowing in such waving

outlines as a type of all that is pure in

the wide earth an incarnation of that love

which hallows a mans soul when he thinks

of a mother or a sister a love stainless as the

snowflake trembling from the parent cloud

and bathed as its floats in the ray of a setting

sun 
but the sensualist whether he whines in the

pulpit or croaks in the press or howls in the

brothel what message has the statue or the

picture or the woodpainting which embodies

a womans unveiled form what message has

this purity enshrined for him nothing but

earth for he is of the earth earthy nothing

but filth for he is born of filthy nothing

but lust for the impulses of his heart are like

the bubble on the dead sea stagnant and

pestilent excretions fomenting on the very

dregs of rottenness and decay 
such a sensualist have i seen talk with

prim utterance in his demure journal about

immoral books quoting garbled passages to

prove his point claiming sympathy from the


moral
public because he had slimed over

some sentence or chapter that was pure before

he touched it and all the while the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



victim of this
chaste
editors perjurya brokenhearted

and wronged woman lay mad and

howling in the cell of an insane hospital

this was a moral editor of a moral newspaper


 
an expression of mingled character passed

over the texans face as he gazed upon the

kneeling girl his large eye dilated and

flashed with unusual light while a smile played

over his lip veiled in her luxuriant hair

the snowy skin gleaming through the interval

of her tresses she still grasped the light as

her tears fell like rain on the halfrevealed

bosom 
come isora said john of prairie eden

and believe me his voice was low and

deep and thrilling with that music of passion

which always steals to the heart and

makes it beat more tumultuouslywe must

away assume this monkish gown and

wind the dark robe over it while i put on the

handsome dress of don augustin or stay

your purpose is changed you will not fly

with me and share the fate of the outcast and

the stranger 
isora raised her eyes john was standing

with his head drooped his hands clasped his

wild and singular face mellowed by a shade

of overwhelming sadness the strong man

seemed melted into very womanhood as he

talked to himselfit was his manner when

wrung to the heart by sudden emotion 
outcast yes i have no home nor father

brother sisternot one friend on the

wide earth of god poor harry i see your

boyish face and clear blue eyesyour voice

o harry how it comes back to my soul

and in cold blood they put you to death i

saw youyes now i see your face dabbled

in blood a smile quivering on your lips and

they are cold forever isabel dishonored

the father hanging before the

porch of his own home his ashy face glowing

in morning sun isora deserts me

too isorathis dear flower which i found

blooming in her mexican home and wound to


my heartisora leaves the outcast to his

fate 
no wonder that voice whispering its wild

soliloquy pierced the maidens soul 
she rose from the floor and winding the

robe once more upon her form laid her right

hand upon his muscular chest while her eyes

shining through the intervals of her hair

burned with emotion too deep for words 
their eyes met the maiden seemed to

grow into his heart even as their glances

mingled in one a rosy red stole over her

cheeks and bloomed in dewy freshness on her

parted lips 
i have no home but with thee 
she did not tell how he had won her heart

how appearing at first in her lonely home

with an atmosphere of mystery and romance

about himhe had besought shelter from his

pursuers this was many days ago she

listened to his story won by the melody of his

voice the strange light of his eyes but more

than all by that absorbing story which spoke

of the dear prairie eden cirled by the trees

of the island grove the gentle brother

harry the dead father and the beautiful

isabel 
from that hour she loved him and many

a time in the gloomy chambers of the mansion

secluded from her brothers eye and

from the gaze of the arguseyed duenna

this young and passionate woman suffered her

unknown lover to kneel at her feet to thread

his fingers in the masses of her silken hair

and looked the magnetism of his soul into her

eyes 
she did not tell him in words this story of

her love but it shone in her eyes it spoke

in the brief sentence uttered with dewy lips

and panting bosom 
i have no home but with thee 
let us pass once more into the shadows of

isoras bed chamber where the monk shrinks

back from the touch of a deathcold hand as

he hears the wellremembered voice














the voice of isabel







 
 






				 
				
				
			







			 
				
				 
 

				







how like a voice from the dead comes up

that voice of the wronged and dishonored

speaking through silence and darkness to

the heart of the wronger





texan mss






fear
not don antonio for i isabel of

prairie eden am with you 
the chamber was dark and that voice

breaking suddenly from the gloom sounds

like hollow accents from the lips of death 
it is her ghost groaned the miserable

man as remorse began to rend every fibre

of his soul from the shadows of the grave

she comes to haunt me 
not isabel the ghost but isabel the living

bloomingfair as when she won your

heart at prairie eden 
the cold hand pressed close within her

own and thrilled its ice to his heart 
nay shrink not from me don antonio

you loved me with an idolatry so wild so

mad loved me even when my father hung

writhing on the tree before his porch his last

groan gurgling up to god as your kiss was

on my lips long years have passed since

then don antonio would you like to look

upon my face once more or do you fear to

behold those eyes which once filled your soul

those lips which once clung to yours when

the heart was maddened by a foul drugthe

soul lost in the dreams of opium 
don antonio started from the couch and


struggled nervously to free himself from the

grasp of the cold hand but it held him as

with the clutch of an iron vice and the cold

fingers seemed like the bony hands of a

skeleton 
wouldst like to look upon my face don

antonio 
not a word from the lips of the trembling

man alone in that dark room with a woman

who had come from her grave to haunt

him he grew icy cold and heard his heart

throb like a deathwatch yet he was a brave

man and had done a butchers work on human

forms in many a battle 
all the while the sound of voices in the

next chamber came indistinctly to his ears

and added to his frenzy for he was frenzied

now cold and hot by turns now burning with

fever and now chilled into ice 
suddenly all was still in the adjoining

chamber and don antonio felt the cold hand

and heard the voice again 
come you shall look upon my face 
the door swung open don antonio had

missed it in his nervous phrenzy and the cold

hand let the shuddering man into the next

chamber 
holy trinity it is the novice brother

paulo 
retreating with a shudder don antonio

beheld in the center of the chamber the form

of a monk whose dark cowl was thrown over

hts head and face suffering only a glimpse of

the features to be visible 
the lamp stood on the floor and flung its





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



upward rays over that dark motionless form

with the marblewhite hands appearing from

the folds of the shapeless robe around were

the pictured walls of that desolate room the

grim portraits and tapestry that flapped again

the stone which it concealed with a slow and

hollow sound 
john of prairie eden isora and the brave

don augustinall were gone from that

gloomy chamber the cowled figure and

don antonio were alone in the silence and

shadow 
yes it is the novice said the wellremembered

voice from the shadow of the cowl

the novice who three months ago entered

the monastery of san francisco as a lay brother

and soon became the secretary of the

reverend monk father pedro you have

never seen this face good fatherat least

never in a cowlnever since
the night
 oh

you remember it

the night of praire

eden

 
don antonio even with his shaven crown

and cheek was by no means an unhandsome

man his dark olive features the boldly

chisselled nose the ponderous brow overarching

large and lustrous eyes the mouth

around whose lips scorn and love and the

power of a dauntless will played by turns

all resembled some antique head moulded in

rich bronze 
he was we say by no means an unhandsome

man his springy step his graceful

form the monkish robe could not altogether

hide but now he was hideous livid in the

face and stricken down as by a pestilence in

every trembling limb a fear a horror worse

than death possessed his veins for before

him in the cowled form of the novice or neophyte

paulo who had glided by his side for

the last three months he beheld not a living

shape but a ghostly image from the regions

of the dead sent to haunt his perjured soul 
falling on his knees he crossed his brow

and cried to god for mercy 
the neophyte raised that marblewhite


hand in a moment the cowl would fall from

the face don antonio dared not turn his

eyes away and yet shuddered as he anticipated

the disclosure of the ghastly features of

the dead 
the cowl fello what a ghastly vision

broke on don antonio then 
that face whiter than alapaster with the

delicate veins traced on the colorless brow

and a single spot deep red burning like a

flame on each cheek those lips pale vermillion

moving without a sound the eyes unnaturally

large spreading with their strange

light from the brow to the cheekbone and

shining with an unfaltering glare upon the

kneeling monk 
around this deathly face like a crown of

ebony was a mass of jet black hair making

the pale features yet more pale and giving

additional fire to the glaring eyes 
there are no words in language to picture

the sad reproach the overwhelming melancholy

of that face around it like a veil

seemed to hang the very atmosphere of despair


 
you think it sadly changed don antonio

that face which once won your
love
yet

we are all changed father pedro five

years ago you were the handsome cavalier

pressing the drugged goblet to the lips of a

weak girl who sank at your feet her soul

wrung in every fibre her brain whirling in

madness now you are the monk and before

you stands the girl whom you dishonored

while her brother bears your sinless sister

away to his bridal chamber bridal chamber

a sweet word fatherbridal chamber

without one priestly rite or marriage vowa

meaning word father pedro 
she raised herself erect in all the pride of

her fallen majesty and stretched forth her

white hand as though she scattered the ashes

of her curse upon his brow 
it was pitiable to see the agony of the

monk whose heart seemed crushed by his

remorse




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






holy trinity my sisterpure and

stainlesswhat hath she done to merit this

wrong 
she is guilty even as isabel of prairie

edenguilty of her innocence and beauty 
it was now the moment when the cup of

don antonios degradation filled even to the

brim before the woman whom he had

wronged five years agobasely wronged

with an outrage that has no forgiveness this

side the grave no revenge save the outpouring

of bloodthis proud man now grovelled

like a slave beneath the lash yes like a

hound beneath his masters scourge 
lady be you a living woman or be you

a spirit from the grave listen for a moment

before you pour the last drop into this bitter

cup i confess my crimes my baseness i

acknowledge this on my knees thus crouching

at your feet i murdered the fatherthe

daughter i dishonoredthe brother i put to

death even as he begged for a crust for a

drop of water no tears no prayers not one

writhing of my victims soul swayed me aside

from my course can i confess more yet

do not suffer wrong to visit her and of

all wrongs that outrage which has no baptism

of redemption but blood for she is

pure she is innocent take my life but do

not olisten to medo not harm this child

whom my dying father bequeathed to my

care 
cold and calm the cowled woman listened

to his prayer not one feature in her marble

face indicated emotion her lip was firm her

eye unfaltering in its withering scorn 
there was no answer from her lips but the


monk read it in that silent vengeance of the

pale beautiful face 
bowing his head on his hands the cowl

dropped over his face and a silence ensued

unbroken by a sound 
at last it was broken by the echo of a footstep

and a halfclad figure rushed wildly into

the room 
it was don augustin his face red with

frenzy stained on the brow with a hideous

wound his form divested of his handsome

coat of green and gold 
you linger hereyoushame has the


monk
robbed you of all that belongs to the


soldier
 to the
man
you linger here and

the accursed heretic has borne your sister

away passed the guard disguised in my

coat and now perchancebut what mummery

have we here 
for the first time he beheld the disguised

woman 
don augustinthe voice of the monk

was husky as he raised his livid facein

that cowled form you behold my fatethe

destiny of my housethe woman whose honor

i crushed without remorse five years

ago in her home of prairie eden 
the small ferret eyes of the mexican

twinkled with rage 
can i believe my eyes is it don antonio

his den in the isle of sacrificios it is a work

of danger i knowyou are afraidafraid

when the honor of the home of your father is

at stake




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






he paced the floor rubbing his hands together

as he cursed some dozen excellent

oaths in pure spanish 
come i will go with you iand don

antonio sprang to his feetbut who will

lead us to the den of the heretic 
a low sad voice unbroken by a tremor


was heard echoing far along the gloomy

chamber 
that will i 
and isabel with her pale face turned to

the light her full eyes fixed upon her betrayer

pointed with her white hand toward the

door














the isle of the sacrifice







 
 






				 
				
				
			







			 
				
				 
 

				







near vera cruz in the isle of sacrificios

where the aztecs offered the sacrifice of

human bloodsubterranean chambers have

been discovered and images of the forgotten

religion with the altar stone on which

the victim was slain





texan mss






the
isle of the sacrifice 
we stand upon its sandy shore with the

dark waves breaking in low murmurs all

around us the deep night gleaming upon us

from the dark dome overspread with stars

san juans castle frowning over the waters

and white orizaba lowering from afar into the

great temple of the midnight universe 
a strange isle with its rocks and sands

and scattered herbage stretches before us

three hundred years ago the altar of sacrifice

smoked with his bloodred incense here

and the groans of the victims echod far over

the waters as the anointed priest of the faith

of murder tore from the mangled breast the

quivering heart 
even now beneath this soil strange chambers

lie hidden stored with the gods and altars

of the aztec faith 
still from yonder shore echoes the tramp

of armed men and through the night the sails

of the american ships gleam like white mists

hovering over the waters 
suddenly a halfnaked form springs from

the waves and stands erect upon the sand


by the dim light of the stars you may discern

the iron outline of that figure with loose

trowsers clothing it below the waist while the

sinewy arms the firm broad chest are bared

to the night breeze 
had you but one gleam of light you would

behold the flesh along the back severed with

many a hideous welt mangled into one clotted

mass of sores and blood 
this unknown man springing from the

waters without one sound or word to warn us

of his approach shakes his huge arms in the

air and with clenched hands and groaning

utterance disturbs the silence with words like

these 
by i am free you shall not scourge

my back again nor dig your lash into my

flesh once more though i am but a common

sailor in the american navy by i

would sell my soul to the devil could i but

have the brave captain of the here on

this barren shore for five minutesonly five

minutes curses upon that flagcurses upon

its stripes and stars the stripes for the

common sailors backthe stars for every

petty tyrant who may buy a commission by

crawling round the avenues of the city of

washington i swear as god sees me to

hate and fight against that flag forever may

the devil catch me this minute if i would not

like to have it here and grind it into the sand

beneath my feet 
the escaped sailor turned from the waves

and steadfastly fixed his eyes upon the barren

isle




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






twenty paces from the shore a small

rock of peculiar shape rises from the sand

near ihat rock your freedom awaits you

what can it mean tonight as i lay in

my irons a paper was pressed into my hand

by a strange man who whispered take this

fileread the paperand swim to sacrificios

i am here but wheres the rock 
even as he spoke there rose at his feet a

small rock triangular in shape with its surface

covered with uncouth figures discernible

by the light of the stars he examined

the rock with a careful and searching scrutiny


 
all was silent around no trace of a human

form was visible 
im prettily fooled growled the escaped

sailor with an oath but its my only chance

here goes 
with a strong effort he raised the rock

from the sand or to speak more correctly

lifted it on one end and a warm light streaming

from a square aperture at his feet bathed

his face with a ruddy glow then it might

be seen that his hair and beard were alike

fiery red in hue his face embrowned by the

sun and rain his eyes bleared and swollen

his teeth revealed by his parting lipsblack

broken and irregularaltogether a hideous

visage 
at his feet as from a well streamed that

hidden light disclosing a rude ladder whose

top rested against the side of the aperture in

an instant his huge form was concealed in

the passage and with his brawny arms he

drew the rock back to its original position

and descended the ladder even steps he

counted and turning his head over his shoulder

saw that he had entered a small room or

cavern with a blazing pineknot attached to

its rocky wall 
in that light like the crude horrors of some

nightmare dream he beheld the details of

the place three obscene idols formed of

porphyritic rock and six feet in height supported

the ceiling of the cavern between


these idols three black spaces appeared evidently

passages leading deeper down into

the subterranean chambers of the isle of sacrifice

on the wall near the eastern idol the

pineknot was hung by its light the sailor

read the crumpled paper which he drew from

his trowsers pocket 
today you were lashed like a dog your

flesh peeled from your bones at the command

of a petty tyrant would you be free tonight

a file will be placed in your grasp and

with it directions which will enable you to

seek the company of a jovial band who acknowledge

no lord nor master save

march th 






it was an interesting thing to observe the

face and form of this escaped sailor while he

stood by the torch engaged in deciphering

the somewhat mysterious epistle which we

have given above 
the light streamed over his red hair and

beard disclosing the sinews of his gigantic

chest and revealing his broad back with the

blood oozing slowly from its welts and

sores 
at first his countenance wore a gloomy

scowl 
i have been fooled he murmured with a

blasphemous oath and tossed the paper to

the ground 
ha what is this he cried as he beheld

a piece of paper some ten inches square affixed

to the wall by a knifebeyond the

eastern idol lies your way pursue it in darkness

for some hundred paces descend a stairway

and await further orders from the




c f r














section







 
 




without a second thought the sailor passed

beyond the eastern idol and measuring his

paces through the darknesswhile a chill air

swept against his cheeksoon came to the

stairway which he descended and discovered

a light shining around the angle of a rock





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



distant from where he stood not more than ten

yards 
he soon reached the rock and started back

with a shout of wonder mingled with delight

the rock a huge and irregular crag with a

similar crag opposite formed the doorway to

a chamber some twenty feet square in the

centre of which stood a table stored with the

most luscious fruit and viands mingled with

flasks of wine 
this much at a glance the escaped sailor

beheld but entering the chamber he examined

its minutest details with something of a cold

shudder thrilling every nerve for around

that table with a chair at either end and

spread as if for a banquet were grouped the

most hideous forms of the ancient aztec theology

sculptured in every variety of ugliness

and looking altogether with their uncouth

shapes stony eyes and distorted features

like the attendant devils of some infernal festival


 
the light in the centre of the table standing

amid fig and oranges grapes and flowers

imparted a ruddy warmth to the prominent

points of the idols while everything beside

was wrapped in misty gloom 
a devilish queer company cried the sailor

as he flung himself in a chair but the

wine bottles look tempting and the cold ham

is not to be sneezed atparticularly by a

common sailor who has not tasted food for

twelve hours ha champaigne as im a

sinnerpop how the sound of that cork

makes them starethese respectable gentlemen

with the stony eyes and peculiarly ugly

faces a slice of ham a biscuit and another

pull at the champaigne bottle i feel quite

comfortable by 
it would require the pencil of some artist

who delights in the grotesque and horrible to

picture this scene 
relieved by the dark background the burly

face of the sailor framed in red hair and

beard stood boldly out in the light in one

hand a champaigne bottle in the other a slice


of ham inserted between two biscuits his

huge form is comfortably disposed in the arm

chair and his broad chest begins to swell

and heave with the fiery impulse of the

wine 
above the rocky ceiling and around the

table those distorted forms and uncouth faces

looking like living things as the light flit

to and fro over the dusky outlines 
one figure towers above the rest a dim

shape of darkred stone with a knife of obsidian

or volcanic glass extended in its deformed

right arm it is the aztec wargod


mexitili
 
and here where the priests of the forgotten

creed administered their bloody rites 

years ago now sits the escaped slave of the

american navy making merry with the wine

bottle in his hand while his roystering catch

is echoed far along the gloomy recesses of the

cavern 
it was a strange song that he sung and

seemed to have some bearing upon a murder

done at sea by a captain of the american

navy




they hung at the yardarm swing so gay

				
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				their feet in the air their faces to heaven

the captain wiped his lips and saidlet

us pray





and then three cheers for god were given




the stars and stripes and the tyrants law

				
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				let us merrily cheerily sing
for god let us now my boys hurah

				
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
				as we merrily cheerily sing




with some dozen more doggrel verses of

blasphemous tenor the escaped sailor plyed

the wine bottle until the aztec gods seemed

dancing round him and leering in his face with

their stony eyes 
then crowning his brow with a wreath of

blossoms snatched from the table he gravely

drank the health of the idols one by one

terming them all good fellows of the right

stripe though dn it they neednt make

such ugly faces




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






the wine which he drank seemed not so

much to cheer as to madden him he felt it

burning like molten fire in every vein and

encircling his brain as with a mass of liquid

light 
whether from his long fast or the peculiar

effect of the wine we cannot decide but

wherever he turned his head he saw the cold

face of a dead man who glared upon him

with eyes like glass as his body hung suspended

to an oaken limb 
that quivering oaken limb that cold white

dead mans face was everywhere now among

the idol forms now moving slowly overhead

now seen in the centre of the table the limb

always trembling the face always white dead

and ghastly 
yet this sight did not strike the drunken

sailor with anything like fear he drank only

the more shouted the louder and trolled as

he danced around the table his doggrel song

until the nooks and corners of the cavernroom

seemed yelling on with the echo of a

hundred voices 
at last whether it was a reality or but part

of his drunken dream we know not but he

suddenly became aware of the presence of a

new guest a tall man dressed in deep black

a veil upon his face shrouding his features

from view 
would you said a voice of full and manly

intonation would you become one of

us 
that depends pretty much on who you

are and what you follow 
and the drunkard staggered to the chair

endeavering to clear his eyes from the fiery

mist which danced before them 
we are a band of brothers who gathering

our taxes from the land sea have turned

this war to our own uses we have gathered

our members from the oppressed in the army

and navy of the united states we have a

threefold objectsecurity plunder and revenge

will you join us 
i will hoss cried the sailor falling into


the slang which he had acquired years ago

in the prairies of the west jist show me a

chance now 
but you are afraid to take our oath you

will shudder at the initiation of the independent

order of free rangers 
the sailor started to his feet leaned over

the table and while his bloodshot eyes rolled

in frenzy grinned until his discolored teeth

were visible as he uttered an oath too horrible

for repetition 
i dont care much what yer oath is im

a royal arch curser myselfi am and as

to yer initiation tell me what kin a man fear

who has been lashed like a dog on board a

free american ship of war show me a

chance i say and let me but stand free to

face with the captain of the only for a

minuteo only for a minute 
wait here and in one hour you will be

summoned by a brother of our order he

will lead you to the altar where your courage

will be tried for as our lives will hang upon

your fidelity it is important that we know

what manner of man you are before we admit

you into our brotherhood rememberin

half an hour prepare 
the figure in black disappeared behind the

image of the war god mexitili 
half an hour passed away the cavern

no lodger rang with shouts of boisterous merriment

the viands were no longer eagerly

devoured nor the bottles emptied with mad

rapidity 
along the table heaped in inextricable

confusion were scattered wreaths of blossoms

slices of ham biscuits bottles oranges

figs and flowers but the drunken sailor who

with the print of the free american lash on

his back reeled here an hour ago singing

blasphemous songs where is he now 
in the arm chair at the head of the table

behold him his shock red hair and beard presenting

a frightful contrast to his face which

is now as pale as a corse




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






he is a very strong man and yet now he

trembles from head to foot his bloodshot eyes

neither turn to the right or left but glare fixedly

before him 
why this paleness this trembling this unknown

fear 
a deep groan is heard 
i believe that my heart is burning to a cinder

within me my temple throbs as though

the pendulum of a clock were enclosed in my

skull i cannot drink any morei tremble

i am hot and cold by turns ah whos

therewhos that repeating my name 

ewen mcgregor
 called a voice from the

recesses of the cavern do you still desire

to enter the brotherhood 
i do faltered the sailor 
then come hither 
he arose tottered along the cavern until

the darkness enclosed him a cold breeze

swept against his cheek there was a hand


pressed upon his ownwhy did he turn cold

as that hand touched his fingers 
advance twenty steps with me take this

knife and obey 
he took the knife and was led forward in

the darkness until the folds of a curtain brushed

his face 
within the chamber shrouded by this curtain

lies your victim bound to the altar of

the aztec faith as they bound their victims

three hundred years ago do not feardo

not tremble but think of the lashes you received

this day and without lifting the veil

which conceals the face strike home enter

and obey 
why did the brain of the stouthearted

sailor suddenly feel as though all the blood

in his herculean frame had rushed into his

skull 
he grasped the knife and dashed the curtain

aside


















the monk beholds the revenge

but he had to drink it

we will return to the chamber of the three

idols 
not ten minutes had elapsed since red

ewen the sailor left its confines when three

figures stood revealed by the light of its pine

torch 
here isabel her pale face framed in the

cowl which increased the strange lustre of

her eyes and made her features both spectral

and ghostly by her side don augustin his

form shrouded in a dainty brown mantle varied

with silver trappings and glittering with

a single jewelled star under the torch his

bronzed visage distinctly disclosed in every

vein and nerve by the downcast rays stood

father pedro otherwise called don antonio

clutching his hands in nervous intensity as

his livid lips trembled with a soundless motion


 
the cowled lady was calm and cold

don augustin redfaced and fiery ubout the

eyes 
don antonio a picture of remorse carved

in black and bronze 
around them the obscene images seemed to

live nnd move as their forms were now darkened

by a sudden shadow and now illumined

by so ruddy a light 
don augustin dashed the sheath of his


sword against the hard floor of the cavern in

a gesture of extreme impatience 
comethe devil and all his imps seize

this night and all its workshe was choice

in his cursing was don augustinwe have

lingered long enough dared danger enough

good lady it is time for you to fulfill your

promise lead us to the haunt of this texan

heretic and pirate as he is and we will

force the lady isora from his grasp 
my sister as my father poured forth his

blood at my feet he consigned thee to my

care murmured the monk 
the brother alone may thread these passages

with me broke in the sad tones of the

cowled isabel father pedro alone may rescue

his sister nay scowl not don augustin

nor curl your lip with scornit must be

so or i will even leave the poor girl to her

fate 
await here don augustin hurriedly exclaimed

father pedro i will track these

solitudes alone if i do not return within an

hour follow and avenge 
why that smile on the pale red lips of isabel

as she surveys their parting embrace

the cheek of the monk laid against the face

of the soldierthe firm clasp of each others

hands and the meaning glance of their

eyes 
i will await youif need be avenge you

isabel led the way into the darkness beyond the

western idol 
saw you that pale face turned to the light

the moment ere it disappeared the eyes and

the lips wearing the same expression cold

relentless ghostly 
now came the moment of don antonios

triumph through these dark passages where

the air was hot and stifling and chilled with

subterranean draughts by turns down these

rude stairways hewn three centuries aye

perchance ten centuries ago in the solid rock

up these rugged ascents where the footstep

became unsteady as it encountered the stony

fragments flung over the dark path on and

on in darkness the monk followed his silent

guide 
the darkness was dense palpable it seemed

to shut him in like the boards of a coffin

the silence was dead and appalling unbroken

save by the echo of their footsteps 
isabel was silent for a quarter of an hour

no word passed her lips but her cold hand

was damp with a clammy moisture that chilled

the hand of don antonio throughout every

nerve 
how the consciousness that he was alone

with the woman whom he had so foully

wronged pressed like a sentence of death on

his soul 
still in all the wilderness of his baseness

and crime there bloomed one beautiful flower

more lonely from the very blackness that

encircled itthe love of a pure and stainless

sister 
at lastoh how gladlywith what an involuntary

cry of delight he beheld ita light

shone from afar over the darkness of their

way 
isabel spoke for the first time 
that light shines on your sisters face 
the word touched don antonios heart

with new life 
on onhe shudderedit may be too

late 
nearer and larger grew that light until it


resembled a sun so round and full and blazing

it broke upon their eyes an unearthly sun

glancing over the darkness of these aztec

vaults 
why linger on each moment of stifling suspense


 
at last they stood near the light it shone

out upon the rock bound passage from a circular

space framed by rocks and lighted up

the roof the floor the walls of this lone corridor

with a red glaring glow 
the passage ends here whispered isabel

that light shines from a chamber from

which we are separated by a solid wall of

rock 
let us enter the chamber my sister is

there gasped the monk 
your sister indeed is there but you cannot

enter the chamber unless you retrace

your steps and from the chamber of the three

idols depart by the eastern passage it may

be well for you to do this but first advance

and through this crevice behold your sister 
don antonio saw her looksaw her face

lighted for a moment by a smileoh how

wild and unearthlyand was afraid to advance

he feared to behold the secret of that

unknown chamber 
she took him by the hand and dragged

him to the sperture in the solid wall of

rocks 
this was the sight which he saw 
a small room circular in form whose wall

was formed by one undulating curtain of faint

crimson which was supported by three slender

white pillars from the celingit was

like a dome and painted to resemble a midnight

sky blue spotted with starshung a

fiery globe which bathed the place in dazzling

light 
this light which seemed to float and wave

in waves of liquid flame was tempered and

softened by clouds of snowy incense smoke

which emerged from the thousand apertures

of the globe and wrapped the room in intoxicating

odors




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






beneath the globe in the centre of the rich

matting which supplied the place of a carpet

was a cushion or couch of rich scarlet velvet

fringed with gold and near it a sofa or divan

of the same rich tevture 
on the sofa half seated and half reclined

was a man of some twentyfive years he did

not seem more his dark hair and beard curled

and perfumed after the manner of the

luxurious sybarites of old his broad chest

heaved beneath a garment of purple velvet

flashing with gold and jewels fine linen

about his bold throat and around his bronzed

hands a broad belt of rich embroidery

across his chest a dagger quivering by his

side 
his face glowed it shone in every feature

with a mad delight it was a face that could

not easily be forgotten 
behold that downcast head those large

eyes whose intense gaze grows soft with

moisture those parted lips which seem unclosed

in the act of murmuring words of

passion 
his right arm was extended it held aloft a

golden goblet curiously carved and brimming

with deep purple wine 
but there was a fair hand laid upon the

wrist of that extended arm 
well might don antonio gasp for breath 
a womans form was couched upon the

velvet cushion her head resting upon the

knee of the man as with an intoxicating langor

stealing over her face she gazed upward

through the intervals of her soft silken hair

and lifted her arm clutching his wrist as if to

seize the goblet 
she was clad in an azure tunic or loose

frock which fell without a girdle from her

shoulders to her knees revealing by the soft

gradations of every fold the gentlest undulations

of her shape below the knees her

limbs were bare their snowy whiteness contrasting

with the scarlet rubiness of the cushion

a delicate sandal of pink satin was bound

to the sole of each foot leaving all beside in


its unveiled loveliness the delicate azure

veins perceptible beneath the softly flushed

carmine skin 
a diamond sparkled on the tunic where it

half and only half concealed her bust it

sparkled with every pulse of her bosom shone

as that bosom rose and glittered softly like a

fading star as it fell 
no more beautiful no more delicate contrast

can be imagined than that which was

presented by the soft whiteness of her half revealed

shoulders and the mazes of her silken

hair as black as a pall 
one tress fell over her rising bosom as i

in shame and veiled it as it heaved like a

creamy billow into light 
the face told the full story of that mad intoxication

which thrilled every nerve of this

beautiful girlthis sultana of the rockbound

bower 
through the lipsthey were slightly parted

glowing with moist vermillion gleamed

the ivory teeth over the cheek soft rounded

downy burned a rosebud flush which

now contracted in one intense heat of passion

and again seemed to spread forth its rosy

leaves over the whole face 
the eyes bright and dewy and shining

languidly from the heavy lids which seemed

weighed down by the intoxicating ordors of

the place were centered upon the face

glowering down upon that beautiful form with

a glance not to be mistaken 
wilt drink isora wilt drink to our

merry life upon the broad ocean where i thy

loverhusband will gather spoil for theefor


thee
from every flag and win diamonds for

thy white brow from every clime and after

the battle is over the good ship with its

royal black flag will tranquilly glide into the

green cove of our island home thou wilt

stand upon the shore waving thy white arms

as thy rover comes up the steep cliffs comes

home to thee covered with laurels and spoil

drink isora to the days when we shall dwell

on our island home




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






she raises her white arms the goblet is in

her hand its golden rim is pressed against her

red lip the purple wine glides slowly in a

rich mellow current through that quivering

portal 
i love none but theethee only juan

wherever thou goest upon sea or shore i

will go with thee in battleher slight nostril

quiveredi will bind on thy sword and

laugh as the red mist waves over thee in

peace when the fight is over this bosom

shall pillow thy head as we sit at the porch

of our island home and gaze upon the young

moon rising over the waveless sea 
she twined her white arms upon his sinewy

hands and dashed her silken hair over his

arms all the while her bosom veiled by

that solitary tress rose like a creamy billow

bearing on its creast a dark and glossy burden


 
the incense smoke agitated by a current

of air descended and swept over them like a

veil 
don antonio could not withdraw his gaze

from the aperture oh what fiend but would

pity him now as the crushing agony of his

soul glares in his glassv eyeballs and quivers

in his parched lips he cannot withdraw his

gaze from the aperture his eye is fixed upon

the undulating veil of the incense smokehe

hears those kisses those words of passionate

transport but cannot withdraw his gaze 
isabelis she still cold and calm does

no relenting throb pulsate in her icecold bosom


 
the light glaring around that passage revealed

that motionless form resembling a marble

image of vengeance veiledall save the

facein a monkish cowl 
once only there was something like a

burning tear upon her colorless cheeka tremor

on her lip it was for an instantshe

was marble again 


don antonio turned he seized her deathcold

hands 
woman he fiercely shrieked have you

no pity look my sister my only sisters

senses drugged by maddening draughtsher

honor torn from her in a moment of delirium

pitymercynot for my sake but for

hers 
isabel was silent one word after a pause

she gasped one only and that with an evident

effort 

prairie eden
 
the monk fell backward as if blasted by

a thunder stroke but those sounds in the

curtained chamber those kisses of mad passion

those raptures of voluptuous transport

he heard them still and was nerved with the

savage strength of despair 
you must save my sister by the holy

trinity i swear your life shall pay the forfeit

of her outraged honor your life i

swear it 
he had grasped her wrists and all the devil

of his soul shone from his features horribly

distorted by passion rage madness 
with but a single phrase she answered

him 

rancho salado
 
the hands of the monk fell he beat his

forehead against the rocks grappled the cold

surface until his nails were splintered at the

finger ends and in the pauses of his phrenzy

he shouted aloud her namehis sisters

name 
isoratis your brother who calls

isora in the name of your dead father

hear me 
the incense smoke waved aside the monk

looked through the aperture 
oh god this is worse than eternal death

she hears me notkisses his arms about

her neckthe goblet isora o shamedespair

villain i defy youproclaim you

face in combatisora




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






and like the chorus to his broken ejaculations

was heard those whispering voices 
mine 
thine only 
but my poor brother harry with his pale

face and blue eyes well drink to his memory

drink to him as he kneels in presence of

his murderer the prayer yet warm upon his

lips as he falls coldcolddead vengeance

to the murderer of poor harry 
give me the goblet thine eyes madden

thy voice whirls my soul as on a billow of

flame i drink juandeath and shame to

the murderer of thy brother 
isora groanednot shoutedthe monk

as he fell back from the fatal aperture in the

rocks his soul stupified by the voluptuous

frenzy which burned his eyes as he beheld

it 
isabel hears this and does not relent ah

the cold remorseless vengeance of the dishonored

woman fail her at once you see a

vivid flash brighten over her face she veils

her eyes beating the hard earth all the while

with her tiny foot 
he murdered my fatheri see his cold

faceoh god how it glares in the rising

sun harry too went forth from home and

came back no more there stands the murdered

my honorthat which is the world

heaven life to a womanhe crushed into the

dust as the poisoned cup whirled its frenzy

through my brain i know it allconfess it

my god but his sister she hath done no

wrong her ravings uttered in the madness of

passion they madcen me i can bear it no

nger 


she turned aside from the glare of the light

and her footsteps echoed along the caverned

passage 
the monk raised his eyesshe was gone

his despair was now complete it was a horrible

sight to see him tear the flesh from his

face with his splintered nails 
suddenly three forms veiled in blue robes

appeared in the light their faces lost to view

in the folds of their garments 
with one movement they seized father pedro

bound him despite his frantic resistance

and held their sharp knives at his bared

throat 
with the bandage across his mouth the

corns on his arms these veiled forms lifted

him to the aperture once more 
he looked 
those who held him were thrilled with the

cold shudder that pervaded his form 
once more 
he lay motionless in their grasp his proud

spirit broken his face changed and fallen as

though the ice of death had been poured

upon it 
you have beheld only the beginning of

justice as administered by the free rangers

now comes the end 
like an inanimate burden they bore the

conscious but palsied monk into a dark passage

which suddenly opened near the bright

aperture in the wall whether it was a secret

door or only a hollow in the rocks which had

evaded his search he knew not but suffered

hem to bear him unresistingly along














red ewen is initiated







 
 






				 
				
				
			







			 
				
				 
 

				







a singular rite was the initiation of the

free rangers a dead man was placed

upon the aztec altar and





texan mss






red
ewen grasped the knife and pushed the

curtain aside it was a wondrous sight that

met his gaze he was a man of giant strength

and superhuman nerve infernal beyond the

fancy of a devil in his remorseless cruelty

but within half an hour a strange coldness

succeeded by a burning senation as sudden

and as strange had robbed his iron sinews of

their vigor 
the knife trembled in his grasp 
he stood in a room or cell or vault as you

may please to term it hollowed out of the

living rock not more than five yards in

diameter the floor was level the ceiling

shaped like a dome but all was solid rock

in the centre of the vault a square form of

stone arose a block six feet long and three

wide with its sides sculptured into every variety

of obscene or hideous hieroglyphic 
at the head of the blockit resembled an

ancient altar of sacrificetowered a shape of

brownish rock veined with bright scarlet and

re resenting in its ferocious eyes embruted

features and upraised war club the aztec god

of war 
around the altar were grouped four living


forms clad in long robes with a mantle falling

over every face 
the mantles were blue the robes bright

scarlet from every robe was extended an

arm grasping a lighted torch their mingling

rays filled the vault with light and scented

the air with grateful perfume 
red ewen stood like a statue dumb with

amazement 
to understand his feelings we must call to

mind the incidents of his life which took place

upon this eventful th of march 
this morning he writhed beneath the hang

mans lash on board a ship of war bearing

the banner of the stars 
only a few hours ago he lay in his chains

when a veiled man appear in the darkness

and taught him the way to freedom 
an hour ago he danced in drunken madness

in the aztec banquetting chamber his

veins fired by something more than champaigne

some deadlier poison than the venom

of alcohol 
now a change had come over him the

madness was gone cold hot fire ice by

turns he stood under the door of this strange

vault knife in hand and shuddered as he beheld

the four veiled forms whose heaving

breasts told that they were living the solitary

shape whose horrible deformity spoke of the

dim ages long since departed when the quivering

victim a strong man full of life was

hewn to pieces in this very cell 
one by one the living figues addressed the

escaped sailor




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






could you become a free ranger admitted

to all the privileges of our brotherhood

 
the right to spoil and slay wherever a

sure foot a true steed a good ship may bear

you 
to gather tribute from all nations on

land and sea alike and select from the loveliest

women of the earth the woman who you

shall call wife so long as it may please you

and no longer 
a short life and a merry one a life with

the outcasts and oppressed of all nations a jovial

band who know no laws save those proclaimed

by their chief who reward the traitors

deed with the sharpest knife and the

strongest cord 
then their voices joined in chorus 
would you ewen mcgregor escaped

slave from the american navy become a

free ranger of the land and sea 
i would faltered ewen as the light played

over his enormous chest and his broad

back seamed with weltering stripes 
with his brutal form and animal face he

stood in that vault likd the appropriate demon

of the scene his burly face with bloodshot

eyes and thick lips disclosing black and

broken teeth encircled in his short stiff red

hair and long matted beard 
his face was pale his lip quivered as he

uttered the response 
then take the vow 
far be it from me to repeat that eloquent

liturgy of blasphemy 
it was loathsome enough horrible enough

in its crowded imprecations to satisfy the demon

of blasphemy himself even ewen

shuddered but that was with the fire and ice

which possessed his veins by turns 
and if i fail in this to obey the commands

of my leader or betray the secrets of the free

rangers may the knife of the suicide sever

my heart may earth deny me a grave when i

am dead and the beasts feed on my senselass

corse 


so ran the mildest part of the loathsome

ritual 
on his knees before the altar he took the

oath to obey the commands of
the leader


whatever they might beand knife in hand

he rose 
advance 
the voice sounded deep and hollow as it

echod back from the dome 
red ewen drew near the altar his animal

visage growing deathly pale 
uncover the form of the dead 
at the word one of the figures robed in

scarlet his face mantled in blue extended

his hand and lifted the altar cloth until a

small space of flesh evidently a glimpse of

a human chest on the left side near the heart

was visible the veins distinctly marked beneath

the clear olive skin 
prepare for the last act of initiation behold

this dead manraise your knife and

strike deep into his chest do thisprove

your defiance of all obligations imposed by

what pious fools denominate moralityprove

that you fear nothing either living or dead

and we hail you as a brother 
yet i swear by he lives faltered

ewen as an indefinable fear palsied his arm

lookhe is not deadthis man upon the

stonehe breathes 
folly your fancy deceives youhe is

deadaye dead he was a traitor and he

died according to our laws advance and

strike 
the blood rushed to red ewens face filling

every vein with the sudden and ferocious

instinct of carnage each starting eyeball

was filled with ejected blood his thick lips became

dark purple he grasped the knife with

all the vigor of his herculean arm and came

nearer to the altar 
still it seemed to move that chest concealed

by the cloth nay the bared spot of brown

flesh seemed to glow as with the sudden impulse

of strong emotion true the face of

the dead man was veiled in the altarcloth





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



yet still the bosom seemed to quiver with

life 
lookewen stands over the dead the

knife raisedit is ten inches longthe point

poised over the bared flesh 
a hissing soundit descendsit is buried

to the hilt in the breast of the dead man 
there was a pause while ewen with his

hand clutching the hilt exerted all his strength

to withdraw the blade

and in the action he

felt the body of the dead man writhe beneath

him

 
at the same moment the altarcloth was

partly raised and the face disclosed 
ewen the giant with an appetite for carnage

like the tigers staggered from the altar

as though the knife had pierced his own bosom

instead of the bosom of the dead 
for that face was a fearful thing to look

upon 
the cloth bound around the jaws of the uncovered

face did not conceal the horrible

working of the features nor hide the slow

rolling motion of the eyeballs terribly bright

with death as they turned from side to

side 
a moan was indistinctly heard 
don antonio marin shouted red ewen

as his veins seemed filled with an intolerable

heat and staggering back he gazed stolidly

upon the writhing features of the dying

man 
a figure dressed in blue and gold stepped

lightly over the entrance of the vault and

approached the altar 
the torch light which shone over the contorted

features of the dyinghark that gurgling

moanplayed upon the broad chest

the firm features of the intruder 
john of prairie eden shouted ewen as

he stood rooted to the floor hey whats

this by the living there is some plot

in this you here who lighted this vault

with those hellish flames and sent the devils

dancing around that dying spaniard 

ah 


he fell writhing in horrible convulsions to

the floor the foam frothing round his lips as

his fingers clutched the hard stone 
by the altarss head his brow uncovered

and his broad chest glowing with purple and

flashing with diamonds stood john of prairis

eden his features wearing a marble calmness

only disturbed by a slight movement of

the nether lip 
there was a satanic beauty about his face

whose broad forehead shaded by dark hair

firm aquiline nose compressed lipsappearing

in the midst of his moustache and beard

and large eyes deep sunken beneath arching

brows now wore an expression not the less

infernal because it struggled with a look of

quiet composure 
he bent over the uncovered face of don

antonio and whisperedeven as his beard

touched the brow of the dying manas his

eyes blazing with rapture shot their glance

into the starting eyesballs of the wretched victim

whispered in a soft voice and with a

pleasant smile these words 
when i withdraw the knife you will die

my friend hold you will injure yourself if

you attempt to speak again for that bandage

on your mouth makes it difficult for you to

dreathe much less speak be perfectly calm

my dear friend for i have much to say to you

ere you die do you know me do you

know me do you recognise these features

whomhis breath swept the cheek of don

antoniowhom do i resemble brother

harryeh or do i look like my father

or holddo you not trace a resemblance in

my smile to the gay laugh of isabel 
the cloth over the mouth was agitated by

a convulsive motion as the dying man made

a horrible effort to speak 
he knew the face look how his starting

eyeballs glare into the eyes of his doomsman


 
this scene seemed even to affect the forms

in robes of scarlet with blue mantles over

their faces by the light of the torches which





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



they grasped you can see their robes heave

as from the impulse of horroragony 
on the floor his giant form distorted into

a shapeless heap of deformityso horrible

was the fire which gnawed his intestines

red ewen lay the foam gathering in white

beads upon his swollen lips the white surface

of his eyeballs suddenly turned to scarlet


 
oh it was horriblehe ravedto force

me to drink that goblet of melted lead hot

hissing hot it burnsit burns o water

water you have covered my brain with

hot coals take your knee from my breast

old man of prairie eden for you are a dead

man your eyes are coldi hung you myself

to the tree 
that is red ewens voice my dear

friend and john smiling pleasantly bent

over the face of don antonio do you know

his voice a pleasant voice you heard it

once in prairie eden i am glad you know

it it was red ewen that stabbed you ungrateful

dog to turn his fangs against his

master my god he cried with an air of

chagrin this man is dyinghe has not more

than one minutes life in him and i have so

much to say to him so many important

things 
look yonder where the curtain hangs over

the narrow entrance and do not breathe lest

you disturb the beautiful vision a lovely

face with glossy black curls waving around

it appears amid those curtain folds the eyes

dancing with wild light gazing with wonder

and fear upon the strange group of this cavern

vault 
it is isora whose brother pinioned and

gagged the knife sunken to the hilt in his

breast lies writhing in death agony upon the

altar 
one movement of johnthe mere change

of his position for a single inch to either side

will reveal the horrible face of the dying brother

to his sisters gaze but john does not


moveall good angels be thankedthere is

a belt of shadow between the dying face and

the lustrous eyes of the sister 
hathat footstep isoro 
without moving one inch john turned his

smiling face over his shoulder and whispered

gently 
my love you have come it is well remain

where you are for a moment only

beautiful isora how i love to linger on the

music of that name
isora
 
the name rung through the vault in mellow

cadence 
she remained there trembling on tiptoe

in the narrow entrance of the vault her azure

tunic relieved by the dark curtain which

touched her shoulder as it fell her snowy

right arm raised upon her panting breast

and half mantled by her unbound hair 
juan i will stand here until you bid me

enter 
how musical the low tones of that voluptuous

womans voice it broke like a whisper

from some blessed spirit upon the stillness

of the vault and right upon it an infernal chorus

after angel music clashed the howl of

ewen writhing on the floor the faint moan

of don antonio gasping from the cloth that

bound his mouth 

he
heard that voice knew that his sister

was there almost within arms length and

yet he could not speak to her she could not

see him 
isora is here my dear friendisora

he whispered in the very ear of don antonio

would you like to speak to her she loves

me the beautiful girl and is minemine

without marriage are you perfectly sensible

don antonio have courage man for

you will need it i am about to place the

cloth over your faceit will never be lifted

while you live never will you look upon a

human face again and you will die with

the voice of your own sister in your ears that

voice which you love to hear invoking vengeance

on the murderer of the father and the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



brother eternal vengeance on the betrayer of

the sister 
it was horrible to see the effort of the dying

man to unpinion his arms and make one intelligible

sound through the thick cloth which

bound his mouth once from side to side

rolled his glassy eyeballs john beheld and

smiled once the nerves of his face twitched

like the nerves of a corpse agitated by galvanism

and then 
john quietly placed the cloth upon his face

and shut him from the light forever 
turning from the altar his face beaming

with a smile he wound his arm around the

lithe waist of the young girl and led her genly

forward 
did the dying man hear that tripping footstep


 
lovemy own isora he gaed his gaze

upon her face glowing so rosy red on the

lip and cheek shooting such voluptuous

languor from the eyes you know my wrongs

have heard me tell of the incarnate fiend

who hung my father in his grey hairs to the

felons tree who had no pity for poor harry

though he knelt to him in the plaza of saltillo

and implored mercy with his blue eyes

the fiend isora who bought my sisters dishonor

wlth the price of a fathers life and

bade her rise from his arms that she might

behold the dead face of that very father

glowing in the rising sun isora you have

heard it all 
juan speak of it no moreno more woman

as i am weak and trembling there is yet

the blood of old castile burning in my veins

i will roam the world with thee juan come

we will find this wretch and will look upon

his agonies while you avenge yes i will

pray god to nerve your arm as you strike

deep exclaiming with every blowfor my

brother for my father for my sister 
eye flashing bosom panting she laid her

white arms upon his shoulder and looked up

into his face 


did the dying man hear that voice look

the cloth on his breast quivers in the light 
you need not roam far my love look

upon the altar lies the incarnate fiend the remorseless

destroyer of my race 
therelet me look upon his face 
she started forward john held her by the

dark eye perusing all the while the passionate

warmth of her face 
no isora you must not gaze upon him

he said but holdwretch now quivering

on the altar i see your chest heaving with its

last pang and know that your moment is near

i ask you now in this moment whose flight

will leave you cold would you like to look on

a womans face and hear her beautiful lips

curse you as you die if your answer is yes

utter but the slightest moan and your face

shall be uncovered 
the wretch moaned 
yes rather than die thus in the dark cut

off from the sight of a human face forever he

would look upon his sister and hear her curse

him as he died little did he imagine that this

beautiful sister was unconscious of his presence

that she did not know him as the incarnate

fiend if there was one thought

darker than another in his dying heart it was

the thought to be cursed by my own sister

the beloved of my heart as i d e 
in that thought he felt horribly felt the

full retribution for his crimes 
no by the fiend whom you have served

you shall not look upon a human face again

die in darkness in the name of the father

the brother and isabel

courage if you willdont writhe there like

a dog 
the voice thrilling in cold tones through

the vault seemed to rouse ewen from his

stupor 
he rose heavily into a sitting posture and

brushed his brawny hand across his bloodshot

eyes the whole scene seemed to undulate

before himthe altar the silent figures the

beautiful isora and the calm smiling john of

prairie edenall seemed to glide slowly to

and fro 
he brushed the white foam from his lips

it was evident that his hour was near for his

finger nails were blue and the ruddy hue of

his face began to deepen into purple the

change of death was on him 
john i know you he gasped as though

every word was wrung from him by infernal

tortures a bad man johnive been



in philadelphiamy boyhave mercy

on him

 
with those incoherent words uttered with

hands clutching each other and bloodshot

eyes rolling in death he sank slowly into a

shapeless heap on the floor 
there was no groannot even a gasp

his purple face became black his swollen

lips the color of blueish clay his broad chest

was frecked with crimson spots not one

quiver disturbed his sinewy form nor did a

single tremor announce that a spark of life

yet lingered in his own muscles he was

deadhorribly distorted and blackened and

swollendead as the rock upon which he

laid 
why does that sudden paleness cross the

face of the avenger does his heart quail

now 
when he taunted the poisoned man and

bade him rise and die like a man he anticipated

a volume of curses from his foamy lips

he believed that ewen would yell forth his

last breath in blasphemies 


but those incoherent words uttered with

his last breath in the voice so very strangely

softened and with a look of horrible entreaty

my boyin philadelphiahave mercy on

him 
john of prairie eden so remorseless in his

satanic revenge felt a sudden shudder pervade

his form a horrible gulf black fathomless

yawned before his eyes he trembled and

sank on his knees his face buried in the bosom

of isora 
her soft hands played upon his forehead

her dark tresses waved over his shoulders

he could feel her heart beating warmly on

his cheek but that voluptuous pulsation

could not still the prayer of the poisoned

wretch which shrieked forever in the avengers

earsin philadelphiamy boyhave

mercy on him 
the figures in blue and scarlet are motionless

the torches still burning in their extended

hands ewen is blackened and dead

upon the floor mexitili glares in horrible

grotesqueness at the head ef the altar john

is kneeling his head pillowed upon isoras

breast and for the last time heaves the altar

cloth as a hollow sound the deathrattle

echoes round the vault 
then over the threshold comes the form of

a woman clad in a monkish gown her bosom

panting her breath trembling in gasps

her pale face flushed in every pore you see

her as she stands over the strange scene her

white hands clutching the robe to her breast

and her eyeseach pupil surrounded by a

white circleglare in silent agony from face

to face 
her dark hair gathered like an ebony

crown around her browswollen in every

vein with intense emotionsburst its cincture

and waves in glossy tresses over her shoulder

glossy and dark and yet amid its

blackness there are streaks of silver grey 
then to the altar advanced the miserable

woman whose life had been an antepart of

hell since the dark day when her honor was

tar and lifted the cloth from the face

and 
but there are emotions of the heart agonies

of the soul which angels fear to behold and

texan mss






it
was in the walnutstreet theatre 
i hear the snarl of the critic and thus he

barks 
heres a pretty transitionfrom the aztec

vault of vera cruz to a philadelphia theatre

horrible here we have a story commencing

on the prairies of texas suddenly

dashing away to a desolate rancho in the heart

of mexico then to vera cruz and the vaults

of sacrificios and last of all to a philadelphia

theatre 
this is truly horrible and the author who

is guilty of the deed should be condemned

to solitary confinement for one day with a

dozen critics selected at random from the

newspapers and magazines of the large cities

such a punishment could make the warmest

blood run cold 
just fancy it in all its details one poor

author among a dozen critics here a critic

from boston brimming full of cant breathing

it talking it living in itcant from head to

foot all cant by his side distinguished by

a jockey eoat and dirtybrown mustache a

cockney critic from new york talking alternately

of progress and pennies wanting very

much to knowin one breathwhen the human

race will take passage in the progressional

steam car for ths millenium and how


much you will give him for a firstrate puff in

his paper 
far in the corner of the cell where our author

is confined behold the magazine critic of

philadelphia a jaunty thing delicate in perfume

with oysterish eyes the scissors in

one hand and the scrapbook in the other

a prim gentleman altogether who pities our

author in yellowish tears forhorrible

being popular with the
many
rather than the


select
 that many the rouge hardy people

of the workshop and plough that select

 some dozen newspaper and magazine

editors of philadelphia who hate each other

most fraternally and yet keep saying all the

year round to one anotheryou are a great

man and i am a great man and we

are all great men so allah bishmallah

there is but one literature it is in philadelphia

and humbug is its prophet 
or yet to go from small things to smaller

a critic south of mason amp dixons linea

baltimore critic the drollest of all kinds of

critics the very friskiest of all kinds of insect

crawling and biting around the skirts of

literature and growing fat as it crawls and

steals look at it a critic whose whitish

hair eyelashes and beard and tallow complexion

all indicate a human thing gone to

seed and sweltering in decay long before it

has enjoyed one moment of healthy ripeness

it publishes a large sheet called soundingly

the universal hemisphere and in the agonising

effort to be witty or die take some

such slang name as major tomkins an





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



writes in bad spelling bad grammar and bad

decency all being very humorous and quite

original 
imagine a poor author condemned to be

crawled over and bitten for one day only by

vulgarity and indecency impersonified in a

major tomkins a baltimore critic 
my kind readers in the country you will

pardon me for this digession about critics

when i assure you that it was undertaken entirely

for your good call this digression a

preface to my story if you please and i will

explain 
you very often see a ferocious attack in

some city perodical which cuts into ribbons

a book which you have been pleased to buy

read and love you wonder at this and perchance

take the attack for an honest expression

of prejudice although you of course

deny its fairness and truth your opinions

would be somewhat modified were you aware

that criticism is in the citiespretty generally

and with some honorable exceptionsa

mere matter of dollars and cents a business

contract between booksellers and criticsso

much praise for so many penniesan honorable

understanding between those who sell

books and who notice them that genius is

a thing made altogether of puffs and that he

who has most dollars can buy most puffs and

is of course the most extensive genius 
you will pardon me if i have the smallest

opinion of these magazine and newspaper

critics for in a circle of twelve i have in my

time seen one crittc who had forged another

mans name one who was a clergyman and

took his brandy and water and was often

led by his sympathies with virtue of course

into place better known than named one

who had issued counterfeit notes in his time

and finding this kind of paper rather unprofitable

took to newspapers one who had been

convicted of swindling and some three or

four who divided among them the shattered

fragments of the decalogue broken into

pieces and trampled under foot 


rather a jovial band of moralists this 
these critics will be the first to attack my

story and pronounce it a combination of improbabilities

when from first to last it is

founded on published facts which i have varied

to avoid the imputation of an unjustifiable

personality 
when they blow their blast and snarl

their snarl you will understand at once what

they mean that i am either too poor to buy

their praise with money or that i have nothing

of the egyptian in me never looking

with favor on that creed which taught you to

worship apes lest they would do you a mischief

and go down on your knees to vipers

lest they should bite you 
it was in the walnutstreet theatre 
look over this thronged house swarming

from the ceiling to the cellar with lifelife

in every shapetapestried in its three tiers

of boxes with human faces a sea of ragged

humanity boiling over in the pitand tell me

is it not a very solemn sight solemn you

laugh 
yes solemn as the air of a grave vault and

more impressive than the black skull of death

look at the scene 
here in the first circle the most elegantly

dressed men the most beautiful women

whose silken garments glow in the dazzling

light as their lovely faces are turned toward

the stage whose eyes outsparkle the jewels

on their heaving breasts and all the while

right before those sparkling eyes in the overflowing

pit you see the hardy sons of toil

mingled with the ragged vagabonds of the

good quaker city 
and all the while in sight of those sparkling

eyes in full view of those grave mothers

and beautiful wives and sinless sisters you behold

the third tier festering with the painted

prostitution of the good quaker city 
delicate contrasts these 
what is the sight that enchains the gaze

of the sinless girl and the painted outcast of

shame that rivets the eye of yonder





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



whitehaired man in the first tier and the ragged

boy in the pit right before him within reach

of his goldenheaded cane on what vision

of moral or intellectual beauty is centered

those thousand eyes flashing and sparkling

in the red gas light 
a halfnaked woman whirling over the

stage her form clothed in fleshcolored hose

that clings to the skin a piece of white gauze

fluttering from her waist her arms and bosom

bare a halfnaked woman whirling over

the stage now standing on one limb while

the other is poised in the air on a line with

her shoulder now trembling along on tiptoe

as in the ecstacy of lascivious frenzy now

crouching near the footlights her head bowed

until her naked breast is revealed to the

universal gazeto the eyes of the sinless girl

the painted outcast the old man and the ragged

boy 
this is the sight which rivets the gaze of

the crowded theatrea woman floating aleng

the stage and trafficing her nakedness for

bread 
for her the poor moth of the footlights

now fluttering in their glare only to be the

more surely withered in ther blaze there is

some excuse it is her livelihoodperchance

the head of an aged mother nay the life of a

sister depends on her dancing limbs every

twirl of her naked limb is one tear less on her

dying sisters cheeks 
but for these beautiful women these greyhaired

men who in the presence of the painted

prostitute and the ragged outcast boy gaze

on this spectacle with trembling delight what

is their excuse 
come i do not place it on the ground of

religion or morality but mereiy as a matter

of common decencydecency so common

that it can only raise one blush and diei

ask you my reader whether the world can

furnish a sight of more disgusting and heartrending

shame than this 
a halfnaked woman showing her limbs for

bread to feed a sick mother or dying sister


perchance while greyhaired men look on

and gloat and beautiful women made by

the same god who made the dancing woman

going down to the same graveworm which

will feed on her formgaze on their sisters

shame and do not blush 
do not charge me with a prejudice against

the drama that miserably prostituted drama

may be made the voice of genius the

music of religion 
but these halfnaked women on the stage

tossing in lascivious transport these painted

ones in the third tier bargaining in pollution

while their pure sisters may look on and up

from the aristocratic circlethese elegantly

decorated bars where drunkards are educated

and poison soldwill you tell me what

all this has to do with a pure and intellectual

drama 
must william shakspeare forever be made

the cloak of loathsome appetites and nameless

pollutions 
it was in the walnutstreet theatre the

curtain had fallen and the dancing woman

was gone the ragged boys were fighting in

the pit the traffic of shame was going on in

the third tier in boxes handsome women

were conversing with fashionably attired men

and here and there a puppy with something

like a human face dressed at all events in

the garments of a man was staring those

modest women out of countenance and fastening

its obscene gaze upon the face of the

pure maiden or the virtuous wife of all

puppies in the world the most impertinent is

the puppy of the theatre with an operaglass

in its hand 
it was in the midst of this confusion between

the acts that two persons entered the

central box and at once rivetted every eye

a tall man attired in plain black with the

slight form of a woman supported by his

right arm 
they quietly took the unoccupied seat and

as if by an instantaneous impulse the





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



thousand eyes of the theatre were turned upon

them 

the man was
 or appeared to be some

thirty five years of age there was nothing

peculiar in his dress black dress coat and

satin vest black neckerchief loosely tied a

faultlessly white shirt bosom sparkling with

a small diamond yet his face enchained

every eye by a kind of irresistible fascination


 
the features were bold his complexion a

pallid sallow olive indicating the traces of

strong physical or mental suffering and the

eyes so unnaturally large and dark seemed

not so much to gleam as to burn in their

sockets there was no moustache upon his

lip nor beard upon his chin but masses of

dark hair fell carelessly over a bold white

forehead 
he leaned his elbow on the edge of the

box and gazed upon the curtain with a vacant

stare 
by his side the slight form of a woman

whose face appeared among the folds of a

spanish mantilla the dark hues of the

graceful robe gave an unnatural paleness to

the colorless cheek and increased the burning

light of her large black eyes which shone

from the shadow of their long and quivering

lashes 
as she raised her hand to adjust the folds

of her mantilla a bracelet was visible dazzling

with the radiance of a solitary diamond


 
altogether the pair would have attracted

the eye in any place and became at once in

the street ballroom or parlor the universal

topic of conversation 
in the theatre the sensation was universal

eyes were turned glasses levelled the house

buzzed with a thousand whispers 
they are the strangers who have attracted

so much notice in chesnutstreet lately 
he is very very richa millionaire 
no a soldier from the mexican war 
i tell you that i have the right story


a mexican general taken prisoner at cerro

gordo 
how odd that mantillabad taste 
i rather like it it gives quite a charm to

her face 
what a splendid bracelet i 
do you observe that diamond upon his

bosom 
whispers like these from fair ladies and

fashionable men created a buzbuz murmur

in the dress circle the third tier was somewhat

eloquent in its remarks rather too much

so the second tier quite boisterous and as

for the pit it seemed to hesitate between a

cry of boots and chuck em over 
a single instance will serve as an illustration

of the public opinion of the pit 
i say hoss screamed a ragged newsboy

raising himself on his toes as he stood within

reach of the strangers arm only separated

by that barrier which confines the whirlpool

of the pit within its limits wot did yer giv

for that ar dimond jimini boys wot a

scorcher 
still the stranger with his cheek resting on

his hand stared vacantly upon the drop curtain

not a movement manifested his consciousness

that the eyes and impertinence of

the theatre were turned upon him and the

lady at his side 
the lady seemed surprised her cheek

flushed her dark eyes dropped their glance 
but the mantilla which halfconcealed her

smooth black hair and floated over the outline

of her small but lovely form could not be

forgiven 
it was an unpardonable sin in a philadelphia

theatre where everybody must dress

like everybody else or be pointed at and put

down 
how odd trembled all over the dress

circle 
at last the lady whispered a word in

spanish 
juan 
he turned and gazed upon her with a look





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



whose mingled meaning it were in vain to

guess and exclaimed with an evident effort


 
you seem melancholy isora in a moment

the curtain will raise and the play begin

it is indeed a very dull place a crowded

theatre 
he leaned back in his seat and the lady

with a single red spot glowing on each cheek

murmured in almost inaudible tones still

speaking in spanish you will remember 
but the
letter
 juan 
a sudden nervous start shook the strangers

frame he turned quickly as though

he had been bitten by an adder a cloud rushed

over his brow 
mastering his agitation he composed his

pale features in a smile 
i cannot show it to you now isora it is

postmarked new orleans your brother is

now in that city he is on his way to philadelphia

he will be here in a few days 
how her face flushed from its sad hue into

a rosy life 
oh i am so happy juan he will be

here in a few days he has forgiven his wayward

sister for her wanderingshe will be

your friend juan is it not so blessed

virgin we will all be so happy 
juan smiled and then his eye flashed his

brow was corrugated the expression of his

sallow face was horribleit passed like a

cloudhe smiled again 
this letter juan is from my brother 
again he started once more that expression

and then the calm smile 
no more now isora when we return

home i will tell you all for the present

your brother don antonio marin will be here

tomorrowperchance tonight 
he said no more but while the curtain

rose and the play went on and the audience

laughed and hissed and stamped he sat with

his cheek upon his hand his large eyes fixed

upon the stage with an absent stare 
it cannot be denied that his face was in


vested with a cold pallid beauty the firm

aquiline features stood out in the glaring

light like the head of an antique statue darkened

by the dust of ages yet never once

during all the play did he turn from side to

side or change his fixed unvarying glance

though forrest was on the stage and the play

was richlieuforrest and richlieu after

the shameless display of a halfnaked womans

limbs 
the play was over and the audience

pouring from the various boxes of the theatre

swarmed through the outer corridor and

swept like a torrent into the street 
amid the crowd descending the stone steps

in front of the theatre the form of juan and

the lady were marked prominent his head

rising above the crowd her mantilla contrasting

with the rainbow dress of the other women


 
the other women yescourtezan and

fine lady mingled together in the crowd that

poured from the doors of the theatre and the

flaming gaslamp on the pavement disclosed

with impartial light the face of the sinless

girl and the painted visage of her sisterwoman

the child of shame 
suddenly even as juan and isora were descending

the steps a cry was heard the

crowd rocked to and froa strange wave of

human facesand universal clamor and confusion

tossed the strongly contrasted mass together


 
it was shouted that the stranger had been

robbed his pocketbook stolen four or five

men with red faces and noses of extraordinary

development were seen rushing toward

him making with their fists an extemporaneous

lane through the centre of the

crowd 
they were known at once as police officers


 
i say mister cried the foremost a rotund

man on whose richcolored visage brandy

had not been showered for nothing i saw

the fellow hook your pocketbookwill know





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



him agin whats the figur damage very

serous 
juan bent his lips to the ear of the redfaced

man as his brow manifested deep vexation

and chagrin 
five thousand dollars were in that pocketbook

if you reclaim it by tomorrow morning


without touching the papers which it contains


one thousand shall be yours 
wont i why ive had my eye on the

feller these three weeks and knowd he was

up to mischief your residence sir the

pocket book ill be in your hands before nine

oclock tomorrow morning 
enough we understand each other

here is my card and supporting isora with

his arm he pushed down the steps and presently

stood on the edge of the pavement

where stood a glittering carriage with a coat

of arms on the panels a liveried footman

holding the open door and a coachman also

in livery snoring on the box 
rather aristocratic murmured voices

from the crowd 
splendid turn out 
just look at them blooded baysand that

darkey with one eye and a blue coat 
isora you will enter and go home alone

urgent business demands my presence elsewhere

for an hour or more nay do not

look so reproachful 
from the folds of the mantilla her pale face

appeared as her lustrous eyes were raised to

meet his glance 
her delicate foot was upon the carriage

stepher hand upon the door 
the letter juan 
it was but a whisper and yet her bosom

heaved as she spoke the words 
within two hours i will return home and

tell you all 
he lifted her gently into the carriage

closed the door and spoke to the lacqueys

in a moment the couch was seen dashing

away through the hacks and cabs that lined

the street 


juan turned up ninthstreet murmuring

as the hurried along 
she fades every houri can see her fade

withering drooping into the grave my

brother her only word from hour to hour

she dreams even now that i have gone to

bring
him
home 
at the corner of ninth and george streets

in the shadow of that immense pile known as

the museum a dark horse stood saddled the

bridle held by a liveried servant juan spoke

to the servant and with a bound sprang into

the saddle and dashed away as though his

own spirit had maddened the veins of his

horse 
up ninth street into the ridge road and

out into the country 
it was a gloomy night in may the air was

damp and misty the sky one mass of leaden

cloud 
along the dark roadthe trees on either

side appearing like a shapeless massbounded

the horse striking fire with his hoofs as he

flew while his master applied the spur and

chafed and maddened him to the utmost

stretch of his speed 
through the misty atmosphere a huge

white mass arose looking somewhat like a

mountain of snow shapen by superhuman

hands into the form of a grecian temple it

was a magnificent sight that college of girard

looming through the misty night but

juan did not see it 
his head upon his breast his dark eyes

glaring straight ahead he kept his mettled

horse at the same arrowlike speed and soon

left the college three miles behind 
down the steep hill into the hollow where

an old tavern standssomewhat retired from

the road its lonely sign creaking on rheumatic

hinges 
a light shone out upon the porch as the

foaming horse bounding aside from the road

attracted by the echo of his hoofs the tavern

keeper lantern in hand came to the door 
i wish you to take care of my horse for





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



an hour or so said juan as he bounded from

the saddle upon the road 
the sleepy host rubbed his eyes and surveyed

the stranger with as much amazement as

though he hid been rained from the clouds 
you dont live here about it may be he

drawled hello hes gone dont much

like himvery pucooliar eyes not a bad

horse though 
while the tavern keeper stood wondering

juan had crossed the road leaped the wicket

fence and was now threading a westward

path that led along a broad and gently undulating

meadow 
in the dayiime when the bees fill the air

with their music this meadow is very beautiful

a broad mantle of trembling green

stretched in sight of the dusty road but now

there was a mist upon it a floating shroud

hung over its gentle undulations and veiled its

moist verdure 


soon the path terminated and before the

wanderer rolled the schuylkill its beautiful

hills and picturesque bridges and island of

glorious foliage all shrouded by that misty

veil 
to the north over those rude cliffs and

down into the wilderness where the herbage

and trees are locked in one woven mass of

leaves and flowers up the steep rock that

rises like a wall stone heaped on stone and

mass piled on mass with vines twining all

about itlike little children around a harsh

old warriorand saplings starting from every

cleft then exuberant foliage clothing the

granite heap with a girdle of summer green 
the wanderer stands upon the summit and

feels the night breeze from the river on his

hot brow and sees the mist gliding among

the trees and over the graves of laurel hill

texan mss






laurel hill
 did you ever see it by daylight

on a sabbath day when the crowd

who come hero to gape about the graves are

locked outon a sabbath day in june when

everything was silent save the bees and all

things motionless as death save the gentle

blossoms trembling above the grass 
it is very beautiful then with its white

monuments and winding walks its high wall

and entrance gate shutting out the hot dusty

road its chapel with stained windows where

prayer is said before the coffin is laid away

in the dismal vault or planted in the fresh

smoking earth altogether a place of perfume

bees and flowers graves burthened with

sculpture and marbles rich in epitaphs 
yet i like it not it looks to me with its

dainty monuments burdened with flowers like

an attempt to be elegant with death and

decorate his fleshless skull with the ribbons

and millinery of the fashionable world 
there is too much mockery too much

mimicry of woe in this elegant cemetry too

much of


here lies my husband
jean


whose affectionate widow still sells ribbons

and laces

at the old stand

no 
rue jacconot







give me an old graveyard where the

graves are hidden among tall grass and wild

flowers where the tombstones peep modestly

above the blossoms and the verdure and a

holy air of repose as if from god imbues

the place where dead people sleep and brings

sweet messages of immortality home to the

soul 
but these fashionable cemetrys mount auburn

greenwood and laurel hill could

you not my dear friends keep fashion in

your ball rooms and leave the grave as it

was in the days of our fathers a holy altar

where none came to look save those who had

friends among the dead 
come boys weve had our dinner and our

wine at the united states hotellobster and

champaigne and all the et ceteraslets take

a cap and go out to laurel hill and have a

jovial chat as we smoke our cigars amongst

the graves 
does that sound very sweet think of a

mother or a sister or a wife sleeping in the

sod while a party of halfdrunken dandies

stroll over their graves venting their obscene

souls in jests that taint the very air i have

even seen one of those wretched manikins

from chestnut street whom the tailor makes

stand on laurel hill plying his opera glass

among the homes of death 
laurel hill is beautiful without all this

garniture of sculpture and millinery of fashion





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



it was beautiful long ago before they made

it a fashionable cemetry 
down by the river where the trees grew

thickest dipping their leaves in the waters

and the bank arises rugged with huge old

forms of rock there is many a solemn walk

among the quiet nooks shrouded in foliage

or over the steeps shaded by the sighing pine

the sunlight comes in stray gleams and

through the trees the river glimpses on the

sight gloomily in the shadows the dark

vaults are seen their iron doors sunken in the

clefts of the rocks while overhead a leafy

canopy waves like a pall 
it was down among these haunts of gloom

that the wanderer bent his steps at dead of

night 
no sunlight now upon the vaults no gleam

of moon or star to light with a solitary ray

those paths leading to the river those windwinding

ways that climb the granite rocks

like the spirits of the dead the mist glides

about the rocks and windsso white and

coldamong the trunks of the centuried

trees 
juan paused before an iron door sunken

beneath a mass of rock with a pine tree shooting

away from the sod in front of it he

took from his breast a key and the harsh

sound of the yielding lock echoed like a shriek

through the silence 
he advanced and in the very air rushing

from the charnel felt that death was there

closing the door he stood in the darkness of

the vault a horrible intense darkness that

seemed to shut him in its stifling folds and

bind him like a cloak 
silence darkness thought 
with a phosphorescent match he produced

a blue and vivid light which glared at once

upon the darkness disclosing the narrow

walls of the vault and shining upon those

coffinsthere are twoplaced side by side on

the floor 
that blueish light burned for a moment


glittered on the silver plate upon each coffins

breast and went out 
the darkness was more horrible from the

glare of that sudden phosphorescent ray 
that ray revealed the features of juan

working with fearful agony and revealed

the names inscribed upon the coffins 
these were the names glaring for a moment

and then gone 

isabel
 

don antonio marin
 
for the first time the wanderer spoke 
i was in the room when john randolph

died and saw him trace upon a card with his

one
night not long ago i stood in a crowded

church and saw three missionaries consecrated

for a great work they were about to

cross the globe and preach the gospel to the

poor of hindostan to aid them in this work

some thousands of dollars were showered upon

the altar nay beautiful women tore the

bracelets from their wrists the pearls from

their bosoms and said 
take these and carry the gospel to the

perishing heathen 
within a stones throw of that magnificent

church at the same hour there occurred a

scene of somewhat different kind behold

it 
leaving the church we will enter this narrow

alley which branches from the main

street in this narrow alley the only light

that shines is from the dingy windows of the

rumshop in this narrow alley at least one

hundred houses or huts are huddled together

some of frame others of brick all with their

windows stuffed with rags 
these houses yield a handsome rent to

their owners you imagine that one family


of three or four persons occupies each

house 
you dont knew philadelphia that is evident


 
let me show you how a single room in

one of these hutsthat one next the tenth

rumshopis occupied 
through the narrow door into this room

with low ceiling black walls and floor some

twelve feet square what have we here by

the light of a penny candle stuck in a porter

bottle you may behold the scene 
close to the wall side by side their knees

drawn up to their chins are crouched at least

twenty human beings from the halfnaked

girl of fifteen to the old man of eighty here

the mother with a baby on her breast there

the negro with his rum bottle and along the

square formed by their huddled forms you

see everything that is miserable in nakedness

disease and rags 
these are the rumshop keepers lodgers

but not all 
all day long they prowl the street picking

rags or begging cold victuals or stealing a

morsel and at night they repose here for one

cent a head 
the porter bottle which illuminates the

room is held by a huge negro who with

rags upon his chest is playing cards with a

white woman who also crouches upon the

floor 
as the greasy pack passes from the white





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



hand to the black hand you see a woman

only a miserable rag upon her formstretched

stiffly out in the centre of the room her

bosom and arms and limbs disclosed by the

light 
that bosom is wasted those arms shrunken

to the bone as for the face you cannot see

it for her black hair streaked with grey falls

over it 
does she sleep 
lift the hair from her face and behold

those stony eyeballs she sleepsand sleeps

all the better that she has had no bread for

three days 
my good missionary friend permit me to

take you by the bow of your white cravat

and lead you from the crowded church into

this roomand dont think me impertinen

when i tell you that the lord jesus will smile

more blessedly upon you if you sell one or

more of your handsomely bound bibles and

buy a little bread a little shelter for these

heathens of philadelphia 
excuse my freedom friend i have an odd

way of saying things but as there is a god

you need not go all the way to hindostan to

find perishing christians 
the breath left her body an hour ago she

is cold now 
the door opens a boy halfnakedfor

his only dress consists of trowsers that reach

to the knee and a check shirt with one sleeve

a boy comes forward to the light you see

his freckled face concealed by a mass of

matted brown hair from beneath whose uneven

ends a pair of bright eyes gleam with

steady lustre 
he may be twelve years old and he may

be fifteen but in sober truth you cannot

guess his age from his face for its lines are

sharpened into premature manhood by a

course of severe study 
poverty and starvation are great thinkers 
mother 


he kneels beside the dead woman and

places his lips to her ears 
mother come i have that which will

buy us bread 
she does not answer himhe shakes her

gently by the armfeels that it is cold 
mother arose the shriek of that poor

wretchs agony you are so coldso hungry

you cant be
dead
comequick i

say he whispered the last words

i have

money mother come

 
the gambling negro turned from his

game 
look yer young gemmen ef you dont

stop yer dam noise ill break yer dam

jaw 
the boy did not disturb the negro any

more he felt his mothers hands and bosom

and knew that she was dead and then went

out into the alley and leaned his face against

the wall and his tears fell without a sound 
she was the only thing that cared for him

in the world she was dead the little boy

looked up to the misty sky and along the alley

and wondered where he should go now

the watchman from the neighboring street

yelledtwo oclock and a cloudy morn

and a dead silence hung over the slumbering

city where could he go that motherless

wretch 
approaching the light which fell from the

rum shop window over the gutter the boy

drew from his rags a pocket book of dark morocco

which he opened and spread forth the

soft silken notes in his dirty hands 
moneyit must be moneyand i cant

readmother could have read em mother

 
his tears fell afresh and he was turning

from the light when a rude hand pinned him

by the shoulder 
come my larkey ill take care of that

money for you o your a precious one

aint you i say charley give us the

barkers well fix this lively youth so that

judge cant ll be pleased to see him a very





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



fine judge is judge cant though he makes

temperance speeches on the bench he can

take quite as big a brandandwater as any

of us 
the boy was surrounded by some half

dozen men with red faces welldeveloped

noses and flashy guardchains 
they were dragging him along the alley

with some force and a few kicks when a

figure advanced from the shadows and confronted

the party 
he had evidently been attracted from the

main street by the cries of the child 
hello its the gentleman that was robbed

well sir you see weve got him we

follered him up watched him and found the

property on his person 
give me the pocket book said juan as

he gazed steadily in the face of the police

officer here is your rewardone thousand

dollars now what will you do with this

poor boy 
o as for him judge cant ill fix him

nothin pleases judge cant so much as to

get hold of a young shaver oh my doesnt

juan or john of prairie eden as you

child and swept back the matted hair from

his forehead 
have you a name my little fellow 
never had a name the boys calls me

young rags an my fathers gone away an

my mothers dead an them men have been

a kickin of me 
blurting his many sorrows in a breath he

rubbed his fists in his eyes and sobbed as

though his heart had broken 
if you want to know anything about him

said the police officer with the reddest nose

i kin tell you for ive had my eye upon his

mother and father for this five years past

his father listed this spring in the navy and

haint been heered on since he was a poor

devil enough but once was rayther respectable

that is afore he first left the city some


years back with the runaway bank director

you see mcgregor was once this bank directors

clark 
mcgregor 
john started as he echoed the word 
yas ewen mcgregor 
ewen mcgregor john whispered as he

took the boy by the hand prove this to me

and ill make your information worth money

to you 
his voice was tremulous he laid his hands

on the police officers arm

about an hour ago when we first set our

watch in the alley to catch this shaver we

come show me where your mother lies

dead 
the ragged boy looked up into those large

dark eyes saw them filled with tears and

took the strangers hand 
come ill show you ye see i was hungry

and mother was cold 
but john of prairie eden did not wait for

the boy to finish his incoherent ejaculations 
the police officers with some wonder and

a few extrajudicial oaths beheld that tall

stranger disappear in the shadows led by

the child to the dark hut where lay his mothers

corse 
into the hut where the negro holds the

light and thumbs the greasy cards 
john bent down lifted the black hair

sprinkled with grey beheld the wasted face

and stony eyes 
years before he had known her so young





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



and beautiful even amid the wreck made

by starvation and disease he knew her and

traced the outlines of what she
had been
in

the withered thing which lay before him stiff

and cold 
you see we hadnt any bread the boy

day
is breaking in the east and the morning

mists glide like phantoms over the broad delaware

the grey light of the dawn steals

through the curtains of the chamber struggling

with the beams of the lamp which

stands near the bed on yonder table 
a sad sight awaits us 
true the chamber is luxuriously furnished

the richly papered walls bloom with the

warm creations of the artists thought the

curtains of the high windows are of satin and

gold the carpet from the looms of smyrna

the bed itself with hangings of white satin and

pillows of down presents an image of voluptuous

repose it is imbued with an atmosphere

of luxury and quiet splendor and yet another

atmosphere is stealing slowly into the place

and covering all things with its vague chilling

mist 
it is the atmosphere of death 
beside the bedthe damps of laurell hill

yet fresh upon his attireis john of prairie

eden his face wearing a dead stupor an apathy

of despair which blunts its well defined


outlines and covers his eyes as with a glossy

film 
the sorrow is too crushing for him to feel

it now he cannot feel it cannot believe

the air seems but a mass of whirling phantoms

it is not reality but a dream 
a dream and yet tomorrow 
isora lies upon the snowy coverlet of that

bed her form but halfclad she rests with

her hands folded her white bosom gleaming

ing the light her eyes closed the fringes reposing

on the colorless cheek her hair descending

over her shoulders and resting in

glossy curls upon her arms 
does she breathe ah the bosom seems

pulseless cold 
a faint trembling of the lower lip alone attests

that the soul is quivering there ere it

departs forever 
so gently she dies that it but seems like

gliding into a pleasant sleep so softly passes

her soul away that it seems a lilly torn from

its stem and cast upon a smooth lake that

bears it tenderly upon its breast and ripples in

low music round it as it floats along




				 
				
				
			






			 
				
				 
 

				






at last her lids unclose how black how

flashing how beauliful those deathdewed

eyes 
juan 
she knew him and reached forth her hand 
he took it pressed it to his lips and bosom

it was wet with moisture from the kiss

of death 
juan i am going ever since the day

when the rite of the church blessed our union

i have felt a burning here 
he laid her little hand upon her naked bosom


 
last night when i came home i laid me

down to sleep and felt that in that sleep my

soul was going fast away yet i could not

until now unclose my eyes or manifest by any

sign i knew you were here i heard your

groans juan your prayers i felt your tears

upon my cheek but could not speak to you

a few moments now are given to me and

let me lay my head upon your breast and

wind my arms about your neck and die my

heart shall beat against yours when it flutters

its last my last breath mingle with your kiss

i am so happy so much peace do not

weep juan there is a bright angel at the

foot of toe bed who lifts his white wings and

says come 
he had taken her to his breast and wound

her arms about his neckah they were so

coldand covered his eyes with her silken

hair but he could not speak 
when you see my brother for he will

come juantell him that i spoke of him to

the last and died so happy because i knew

that he had forgiven me tell himah

juan my arms are cold i cannot move my


fingers is it dark juan or have my eyes

been covered by a veil 
over his shoulder she raised her head

glaring around with her large deep eyes

they were glassya misty film shrouded

their dazzling brightness 
how her slight form rocked as his broad

chest heaved and struggled and fell with the

overwhelming agony of that hour yet he

spoke not but grasping her hair swept its

glossy masses over his eyes and wept aloud 
it is dark juani cannot see you holy

virgin mary mother of god pity and forgive

me a weak weak child closer juan

kiss me ice upon my heart juan ice but

i can feel your lips your breath warms my

cheek my brother juan tell himah

the white angel lifts his wingsi see him now


it is light again
come come 
a trembling flutter of the lips and the

white angel has borne a spirit home 
those icy arms are round his neck that

icy breast against his own the glassy eyes

how cold how dead they glare the lips that

are pressed to his are chilled and colorless

forever 
still he tries to dry the tears with the soft

masses of her silken hair and kisses her cold

lips as if to win back the departed soul 
little did the proud revengeful man imagine

this hour when in her home of vera

cruz he cruelly planned her shame that he

should ever weep hot scalding tears for the

sister of don antonio that he should love

her better than life or what to the proud heart

is worth all revenge and press her dead

breast to his heart and drench her silken hair

with the baptism of her agony 
may be some white angel had changed his





				 
				
				
			




			 
				
				 
 

				



breast and turned the blight of his revenge

into a blessing fresh from god 
she died the victim of a rapid and imperceptible

decay but died without knowing that

her brother was the writhing wretch of the

aztec vanlt of sacrificios the destroyer o

haired old man and blueeyed boy 
for that ignorance which hailed her dying

hour let us bless the white angel who lifted

its wings as she grew cold and whispered

gents shall we elevate the the 
devil along chesnut street or shall we 
subside quietly to our homes let s 
toss up for it which shall have the 
night brandy and oysters or quilts 
and feather-beds and as he spoke 
the little man broke loose from the 
grasp of his friends and retiring to the 
shelter of an awning-post flung his 
cloak over his shoulder with a vast 
deal of drunken dignity while his 
vacant eyes were fixed upon the con 
vivial group scattered along the pave 
ment 

 brandy cried a gentleman 
distinguished by a very pursy figure 
enveloped in a snow-white overcoat

powder-mill in your head and blows 
it up dam im mem byrne- 
wood d ye hear write to thercor- 
porationto-moirow about these curst 
mountainous pavements and hav 
ing thus said the pursy gentleman re 
treated to the shelter of another awning- 
post leaving the two remaining members of the convivial party in full 
possession of the pavement which 
they laid out in any given number of 
garden-plots without delay 

 byrnewood d ye hear ex- 
 



the merchant s daughter 



claimed the tallest gentleman of the 
tivaio gathorrr g his frogged overcoat 
c-ioser around him while his mus 
tachioed lip was wreathed in a drunken 
smile look yonder at fthe state- 
house sing singular phenomenon

duplicate two steeples by jupiter 
remarkable effect of moonlight very 
doesn t it strike you byrnewood 
that yonder watch-box is walking 
across the street to black the lamp 
post s eyes for for making a 
face at him 

the gentleman thus addressed 
instead of replying to the sagacious 
query of his friend occupied a small 
portion of his leisure time in perform 
ing an irregular spanish dance along 
the pavement terminating in a pleasant 
combination of the cachuca with a 
genuine new jersey double-shuffle 
this accomplished he drew his well 
proportioned figure to its full height 
cast back his cloak from his shoulders 
and turned his face to the moonlit sky 
as he gazed upon the heavens clear 
cold and serene as death the moon 
light falling over his features dis 
closed a handsome tho pallid face 
relieved by long curling locks of jet 
black hair for a moment he seemed 
intensely absorbed amid the intricacies 
of a philosophical reverie for he frequently put his thumb to his nose and 
described circles in the air with his 
outspread fingers at last tottering 
to a seat on a fire-plug he delivered 
himself of this remarkable expression 
of opinion 
 miller the prophet s right right 

i say the world d n the plug 

how it shakes the world is coming 
to an end for certain for d ye see 



i boys there s two moons shining up 
yonder this blessed night sure as 
fate 

the scene would have furnished a 
tolerable good subject for an effective 
convivial picture f cm lt - cj c 

there seated on the door-way step 
of a four storied dwelling his arms 
crossed over his muscular chest his 
right hand grasping a massive gold- 
headed cane mr gustavus lorrimer 
commonly styled the handsome gus 
lorrimer in especial reference to his 
well-known favor among the ladies 
presented to the full glare of the 
moonbeams a fine manly countenance 
marked by a brilliant dark eye a nose 
slightly aquiline a firm lip clothed 
with a mustache while his hat tossed 
slightly to one side disclosed a bold 
and prominent forehead relieved by 
thick clusters of rich brown hair 
his dark eye at all times full of fire 
shone with a glance of unmistakeable 
humor as he regarded his friend 
seated on the fire-plug directly opposite 
the doorway steps 

this friend mr byrnewood as 
he had been introduced to lorrimer 
was engaged in performing an extem 
poraneous musical entertainment on 
the top of the fire-plug with his fingers 
while his legs were entwined around 
it as though the gentleman was urging 
a first-rate courser at the top of his 
speed 

his cloak thrown back from his 
shoulders his slight though well-pro 
portioned and muscular form was 
revealed to the eye enveloped in 
a closely fitting black frock-eoat 
his face was very pale and his long 
hair which swept in thick ringlets to 
his shoulders was dark as a ravens 



 the vvager 



lt 



wing yet his forehead was high and 
massive his features regular and his 
jet-black eye bright as a flame-coal 
his lips now wreathing in the very 
silly smile peculiar to all worshippers 
of the bottle-god were it is true 
somewhat slight and thin and when 
in repose inclining to severity in ex 
pression yet the general effect of his 
countenance was highly interesting 
and his figure manly and graceful in 
its outlines although not so tall by 
half-a-head as the magnificent gus 
lorrimer 

while he is beating a tattoo on the 
fire-plug let us not forget our other 
friends col mutchins in his snow- 
white overcoat and shiny hat and mr 
sylvester j petriken in his glazed 
cap and long cloak as leaning against 
opposite awning posts they gaze in 
each others faces and afford a beauti 
ful contrast for the pencil of our friend 
darley 

col mutchins face you will ob 
serve is very much like a picture of a 
dissipated full-moon with a large red 
pear stuck in the centre for a nose 
while two small black beads placed 
in corresponding circles of crimson 
tape supply the place of eyes the 
colonel s figure is short thick-set and 
corpulent he is very broad across the 
shoulders broader across the waist 
and very well developed in the region 
of the hands and boots the gen 
tleman clinging nervously to the op 
posite awning post is remarkable for 
three things smallriess of stature 
shghtness of figure and slimness of 
legs his head is very large his 
face remarkable for its pallor is long 
wad square looking as though it had 



been laid out with a rule and compass 
with a straight formal nose placed 
some distance above a wide mouth 
marked by two parallel lines in the 
way of lips his protuberant brow 
faintly relieved by irregular locks of 
mole-skin colored hair surmounted by 
a high glazed cap overarches two 
large oyster-like eyes that roll about 
in their orbits with the regularity of 
machinery these eyes remind you 
of nothing more than those glassy 
things which in obedience to a wire 
give animation to the expressive face 
of a dresden wax-doll 

and over this scene of quadruple 
convivialism shone the midnight moon 
her full glory beaming from a serene 
winter sky upon the roofs and 
steeples of the quaker city the 
long shadows of the houses on the 
opposite side of the way fell darkly 
along the street while in the distance 
terminating the dim perspective arose 
the state-house buildings with the 
steeple shooting upward into the clear 
blue sky 

 that champagne hiccupcd 
mr petriken clinging to the awning- 
post under a painful impression that it 
was endeavoring to throw him down 

that champagne was very strong 
and the oysters oh my 

 as mortal beings we are subject 
to sud sudden sickness observ 
ed the sententious mutchins gathering 
his awning-post in a fonder embrace 

 i say byrnewood how shall 
we terminate the night did i under 
stand you that the d was to be 

raised if so let s start think how 
many bells are to be pulled how many 
watch-boxes to be attacked how many 



the merchant s daughter 



curse the thing i believe i m 
toddied watchmen to be licked 
come on boys 

 hist gus you ll scare the fire- 
plug he s trying to run off with me 

the scoundrel wait till i put the 
spurs to him i say 

 come on boys let s go round 
to smokey chiffin s oyster cellar and 
have a cozy supper come on i say 
take my arm byrnewood there 
steady here petriken never mind 
the awning-post take this other arm 

now mutchins hook silly s arm 
and let s travel 

but mutchins who by the way 
had been out in a buffaloe hunt the 
year before was now engaged in an 
imaginary though desperate fight 
with a sioux warrior whom he bela 
bored with terrific shrieks and yells 

 d n the fool he ll have us 

all imthe watch house exclaimed 
lorrimer who appeared to be the 
soberest of the party by several bottles 
 fun is fun but this thing of cut 
ting up shines in chesnut street after 
twelve when it keep steady silly 
amounts to yelling like a devil in 
harness is un-un-der-stand me no 
fun come along mutchy my boy 
and arm in arm linked four 
abreast like horses very tastelessly 
matched the boon companions tottered 
along chesnut street toward smokey 
chiffin s oyster cellar where they 
arrived with but a single interruption 

hao-pao-twel-o-glor-a-a-damuley 
-mor 

this mysterious combination of 
sounds emanated from a stout gen 
tleman in a slouching hat and four 
or five overcoats who with a small 
piece of cord -wood in his hand met 



our party breast to breast as they were 
speeding onward in full career 

 i say stranger do that over 
again will yo shrieked petriken 
turning his square face over his 
shoulder and gazing at the retreating 
figure with the cord-stick and the 
overcoats jist do that again if you 
please let me go i tell you gus 
don t you see this is some dis-dis- 
tinguished vocal -ist from london 
what a pathos there is in his voice 
so deep so full why brough is 
nothing to him knock wood and 
seg-seguin and shrival and a 
dozen more into a musical cocked-hat 
and they can t equal our mys-myste- 
rious friend 

 i say you d better tortle on my 
coveys cried he of the great coats 
and cord stick in a subterranean 
voice or p r aps my fellers ye d 
like to tend mayor scott s tea-party 
would ye 

thank you kindly exclaimed 
gus lorrimer in an insinuating tone 
 otherwise engaged but my friend 
if you will allow me to ask what 
do you mean by that infernal noise you 
produced just now let us into the 
lark 

the gentleman of the cord stick and 
overcoats was however beyond hear 
ing by this time and our friends 
moved on their way byrnewood ob 
serving in an under tone somewhat 
roughened by hiccups that on his 
soul he believed that queer old cove 
in the slouched hat meant by his 
mysterious noise to impart the impor 
tant truth that it was half -past ticelve 
o clock and a moonlight morning 

descending into smokey chiffin g 
subterranean retreat our friends were 



the wager 



wailed upon by a very small man 
with a sharp face and a white apron 
and a figure so lank and slender thai 
the idea involuntarily arose to the 
spectators mind of whole days and 
nights of severe training having been 
bestowed upon a human frame in order 
to reduce it to a degree of thinness 
quite visionary 

 come my virginia abstraction 
exclaimed lorrimer show us into 
a private room and tell us what 
yov ve got for supper 

 this way sir this way gents 
cried smokey chiffin as the thin gen 
tlemen was rather familiarly styled 
 what got for supper woodcock 
air excellent sir venison sir ex 
cellent sir oysters sir stewed sir 
fried sir roasted sir or in the shell 
sir excellent sir some right fresh 
fed on corn-meal sir what have sir 
excellent sir this way gents 



fare the host attended by his cus 
tomers disappeared from the refrec- 
tory proper through an obscure door 
into the private room 

there may be some of our readers 
who have never been within the con 
fines of one of those oyster-caverns 
which abound in the quaker city 
for their especial benefit we will en 
deavor to pencil forth a few of the 
most prominent characteristics of the 



 oyster

saloon by mr samuel 



lighted by flaring gas-pipes it was 
divided into two sections by a blazing 
hot coal stove the section beyond 
the stove wrapt in comparative ob 
scurity was occupied by two opposing 
rows of boxes looking very much 
jke conventual stalls ranged side by 



side for the accommodation of the 
brothers of some old-time monastery 
the other section all light and glitter 
and show was ornamented at its ex 
treme end by a tremendous mirror 
in which a toper might look time 
after time in order to note the various 
degrees of drunkenness through which 



an oyster-box embellish 
ed by a glorious display of tin signs 
with gilt letters holding out inviting 
manifestations of oysters stewed fried 
or in the shell occupied one entire 
side of this section gazing directly in 
the face of the liquor bar placed oppo 
site garnished with an imposing array 
of decanters paint gilding and glasses 
and the company gathered herel 
not very select you may be sure 
four or five gentlemen with seedy 
coats and effloresent noses were warm 
ing themselves around the stove and 
discussing the leading questions of the 



and as he thus delivered his bill of day two individuals whose visits to 



the bar had been rather frequent were 
kneeling in one corner swearing at a 
very ragged dog whom they could nt 
persuade to try a glass of imperial 
elevator and seated astride of a 
chair silent and alone a young man 
whose rakish look and ruffled attire 
betrayed the medical student on his 
first spree was endeavouring to hold 
himself steady and look uncommonly 
sober which endeavour always pro 
duces as every body knows the most 
ridiculous phase of drunkenness 

these oyster cellers are queer 
things like the caverns of old story 
in which the giants those ante-dilu- 
vian rowdies used to sit all day long 
and use the most disreputable arts to 
inveigle lonely travellers into then- 
clutches so these modern dens are 



 



the merchant s daughter 



ccupied by a jolly old giant of a de 
canter who too often lures the unsus 
pecting into his embrace a strange 
tale might be told could the stairway 
leading down into the oyster celler 
be gifted with the power of speech 
here youth has gone down laughing 
merrily and here youth has come up 
his ruddy cheek wrinkled and his 
voice quavering with premature age 
here wealth has gone down and kept 
going down until at last he came up 
with his empty pocket turned inside 
out and the gripe of grim starvation 
on his shoulder here hope so 
young so gay so light-hearted has 
gone down and came up transformed 
into a very devil with sunken cheeks 
bleared eyes and a cankered heart 
oh merry cavern of the oyster celler 
nestling under the ground so close to 
independence hall how great the 
wonders how mighty the doings how 
surprising the changes accomplished 
in your pleasant den by your jolly 
old giant of a decanter 

it is here in this oyster celler that 
we open the fearful tragedy which it 
is the painful object of our narrative 
to tell here amid paint and glitter 
and gilding amid the clink of glasses 
and the roar of drinking songs oc 
curred a scene which trifling and 
insipid as it may appear to the casual 
observer was but the initial letter to 
a long and dreary alphabet of crime 
mystery and bloodshed 

in a room small and comfortable 
lighted by gas and warmed by a 
cheerful coal-fire around a table furn 
ished with various luxuries and garn 
ished with an array of long necked 
bottles we find our friends of the con 
vivial party their revel had swelled 



to the highest glass clinked against 
glass bottle after bottle had been ex 
hausted voices began to mingle to 
gether the drinking song and the 
prurient story began to pass from lip 
to lip while our sedate friend smokey 
chiffin sate silently on the sofa re 
garding the drunken bout with a glance 
of quiet satisfaction 

let me see let me see he 
murmured quietly to himself four 
bottles o cham at two dollars a bot 
tle four times two is eight hum 

hum they ll drink six more 
let s call it twelve altogether say 
twenty-four shiners for supper and all 
hum hum gus pays for all

cried byrnewood rising from his seat 
and flinging his hand unsteadily across 
the table damme i like you old 
fellow never never knew until 
to-night met you at mutchin s room 

wish i d known you all my life 
give us your hand my boy 

calm and magnificent gustavus 
extended his hand and exclaimed in 
a voice which champaigne could not 
deprive of its sweetness that it gave 
him pleasure to know such a regular 
bird as mister byrnewood great plea 
sure extraordinary pleasure 



i this genteel term is applied to a well 
dressed edition of the vulgar stool-pigeon 
used by gamblers to decoy the unwary into 
their dens the stool-pigeon is the loafei 
decoy the roper is very aristocratic prevail 
jn the large hotel and is called a -r gentleman

thing queer going on with that gas 
light i say smokey is nt there a 
beetle tryin to mash his brains out

stood erect the bold outline of his 
manly form his handsome face the 
high forehead relieved by thick masses 
of brown hair the aquiline nose the 
rounded chin and the curving lip 
darkened by a mustache all shown to 
advantage in the glowing light 
gentlemen fill your glasses no

three springing unsteadily to their 
feet and raising their glasses on high 
woman three times three 
hip-hip-hurrah

 gentlemen cried petriken 
sinking heavily in his chair did 
any of you see the last number of my 
magazine the ladies western 
hemisphere and continental organ 
offers the following inducements to 
sub subscribers one fashion-plate 
and two steel engravings per number 
 pages octavo sylvester j 
petriken editor and proprietor office 
 drayman s alley up stairs 
damme mutchins what s your idea 
of fleas 

there was not it is true the most 
visible connexion between the ladies 
continental organ and the peculiar 
insect so troublesome to young 
puppies and very small kittens yet 
as mr petriken was not exactly 
sober and col mutchins very far 
from the temperance pledge the idea 
seemed to tickle them both immensely 
and they joined in a hearty laugh 
which terminated in another glaat 
from a fresh bottle of champagne 

 let s have your story gus 
shouted byrnewood let s have 
your story damme life s but 



 



the merchant s daughter 



porcelain cup to-day we have it to 
morrow we hav nt why not fill it 
with sweetness 

as he said this in tones indistinct 
with liquor he flung his long curling 
hair back from his brow and tossed 
his glass unsteadily on high 

life a porcelain cup why not fill it 
with sweetness great god of mercy 
could the terrible future which was 
to break in a few brief hours with all 
its horrors on the head of this young 
man who now sat unconsciously at 
the drinking board have at that mo 
ment assumed a tangible form it 
would have stood like an incarnate 
devil at his shoulder its outstretched 
hand pouring the very gall of despair 
into the cup of his life crowding it to 
the brim with the wormwood of death 

 well boys for my story it s a 
story of a sweet girl my boys a 
sweet girl about sixteen with a large 
blue eye a cheek like a ripe peach and 
a lip like a rose-bud cleft in two 

 honor bright gus damme that s 
a quotation from my last ladies 
western hem damme gus 

byrnewood do hold poor silly 
down there s this material differ 
ence boys between a ripe peach or a 
cleft rose-bud and a dear little 
woman s lips or cheek a ripe peach 
won t throb and grow warm if you lay 
your cheek against it and i never yet 
heard of a rose-bud that kissed back 
again she s as lovely a girl as ever 
trod the streets of the quaker city 
noble bust slender waist small 
feet and delicate hands her hair 
damme byrnewood you d give your 
eyes for the privilege of twining your 
hands through the rich locks of her 
dark brown hair 



 well well go on who is this 
girl uncover the mystery 

 patience my boy patience a 
little of that soda if you please now 
gentlemen i want you to listen atten 
tively for let me tell you you don t 
hear a story like mine every day in 
the year 

half sobered by the combined in 
fluences of the soda water and the in 
terest of lorrimer s story byrnewood 
leaned forward fixing his full dark 
eyes intently upon the face of gus 
who was seated opposite while col 
mutchins straightened himself in his 
chair and even petriken s vacant face 
glowed with a momentary aspect of 
sobriety 

 i see boys that you expect some 
thing nice smokey put some more 
coal on that fire well byrnewood 
you must know i m a devil of a fellow 

among the girls and and d n 

the thing i don t know how to get at 
it well here goes about two weeks 
ago i was strolling along chesnut 
street towards evening with boney 
that s my big wolf dog you know 
at my heels i was just wondering 
where i should spend the evening 
whether i should go to see forrest at 
the walnut or take a turn round 
town when who should see walking 
ahead of me but one of the prettiest 
figures in the world in a black silk 
mantilla with one of these saucy kiss- 
me-if-you-dare bonnets on her head 
the walk of the creature and a little 
glimpse of her ankle excited my 
curiosity and i pushed ahead to get a 
view of her face by jupiter you 
never saw such a face so soft so 
melting and damme so innocent 
she looked positively bewitching in 



the wager 



that saucy bonnet with her hair part 
ed over her forehead and resting each 
cheek in a mass of the richest curls 
that ever hung from the brow of mor 
tal woman 

 well gus we ll imagine all this 
she was beautiful as a houri and 
priceless as the philosopher s stone 

j 

 byrnewood you are too impatient 
a pretty woman in a black silk man 
tilla with a lovely face peeping from 
a provoking bonnet may seem nothing 
to you but the strangest part of the 
adventure is yet to come as i looked 
in the face of this lovely girl she to 
my utter astonishment addressed me 
in the softest voice in the world 
and 

called you by name 

 no not precisely it seems 
she mistook me for some gentleman 
whom she had seen at a country 
boarding-school i took advantage of 
her mistake walked by her side for 
some squares along chesnut street 
and 

 became thoroughly acquainted 
with her i suppose suggested 
byrnewood 

 well you may judge so when i 
mention one trifling fact for your 
consideration this night at three 
o clock this innocent girl the flower 
of one of the first families in the city 
forsaking home and friends and all 
that these sweet girls are wont to hold 
dear will seek repose in my arms 

 she can t be much exclaimed 
byrnewood over whose face a look 
of scornful incredulity had been gather 
ing for some few moments past 
 pass that champagne petriken my 
boy gus i don t mean to oflend 



you but i rather think you ve oeen 
humbugged by some slevver 

a frown darkened over lorrimer s 
brow and even as he sate you might 
see his chest heave and his form 
dilate 

 do you mean to doubt my word 
sir 

 not at all not at all but you 
must confess the thing looks rather 
improbable will you smoke col 
may i ask whether there was any 
one in company with the lady when 
first you met her 

 a miss something or other i 
forget her name a very passable 
beauty of twenty and upwards and i 
may add a very convenient one for 
she carried my letters and otherwise 
favored my cause with the sweet 
girl 

 and this sweet girl is the flower 
of one of the first families in the 
city asked byrnewood with a half 
formed sneer on his upper lip 

 she is answered lorrimer 
lighting a cigar 

 and this girl to-night leaves 
home and friends for you and three 
hours hence will repose in your 
arms 

 she will and lorrimer va 
cantly eyed a column of smoke wind 
ing upward to the ceiling 

 you will not marry her 

 ha-ha-ha you re ahead of me 
now only a pretended marriage 
my boy as for this life interest in 
a womim it don t suite my taste a 
nice little sham marriage my boy is 
better than ten real ones 



x cant term used by profligates for female 
servants of indifferent cnaracter 



 



the merchant s daughter 



 you would be a d d fool to 

marry a woman who flung herself in 
your power in this manner how do 
know she is respectable did you 
ever visit her at her father s house 
what is her name do enlighten us 
a little 

 your cute my boy mighty cute 
as the yankee says but not so cute 
as you think her name d ye 
think i m so particularly verdant as to 
tell it i know her name could tell 
you the figure of her fathers wealth 
but have never been mside of the 
threshold of her home secret meet 
ings secret walks and even an assum 
ed name are oftentimes wonderfully 
convenient 

 gus here is a hundred dollar bill 
on the bank of north america i am 
as you see somewhat interested in 
your story i will stake this hundred 
dollars that the girl who seeks your 
arms to-night is not respectable is 
not connected with one of the first 
families in the city and more than all 
has never been any better than a com 
mon lady of the sidewalk 

book that bet mutchins you 
heard it silly and now byrnewood 
here is another hundred which i will 
deposit with yours in mutchins hands 
until the bet is decided come with 
me and i ll prove to you that you ve 
lost you shall witness the wedding 
ha ha and to your own sense of 
honor will i confide the secret of the 
lady s name and position 

 the bet is booked and the money 
is safe murmured the sententious 
mutchins enclosing the notes in the 
leaves of his pocket-book i ve 
heard of many rum go s but this is 
he rummest go of all 



 if i may be allowed to use the 
expression this question involves a 
mystery a decided mystery for 
instance what s the ladys name 
there is a point from which hypo 
thesis may derive some labor what s 
in a name as shakspeare says 
say gents let s pick out a dozen 
names and toss up which shall have 
it 

this rather profound remark of 
mr petriken s was received with 
unanimous neglect 

it was observable that during this 
conversation both lorrimer and 
byrnewood had been gradually re 
covering from the effects of their de 
bauch lorrimer seemed somewhat 
offended at the distrust manifested by 
byrnewood who in his turn appear 
ed to believe the adventure just related 
with very many doubts and modifica 
tions 

lorrimer leaned over the table and 
whispered in sylvester s ear 

 damme damme my fellow 
murmured sylvester apparently in 
reply to the whispered remark of his 
friend it cannot be done why 
man its a penitentiary offence 

lorrimer again hissed a meaning 
whisper in the ear of the little man 

well well as it is your wish i ll 
do it a cool fifty did you say you 
think a devlish sight of the girl do 
you then i must provide myself 
with a gown and prayer book i flat 
ter myself i ll rather become them 
three o clock did you say 

aye aye answered lorri 
mer turning to the rubicund face of 
col mutchins and whispering hurried 
ly in his ear 

a pleasant smile overspread the 



mary 



face of the benevolent man and his 
pear-shaped nose seemed to grow ex 
pressive for a single moment 

d d good idea i ll be your 

too-confiding uncle eh stern but 
relenting i ll bless the union with 
my benediction fll give the bride 
away 

 come along byrnewood here 
smokey is the money for our supper 
mark you gentlemen mr petriken 
and col mutchins the hour is three 

o clock don t fail me if the d 

himself stands in the way take my 
arm byrnewood and let s travel 

then hey for the wedding 
daylight will tell who wins 

and as they left the room arm in 
arm bound on the adventure so sud 
denly undertaken and so full of in 
terest and romance petriken looked 
vacantly in mutchins face and mutch- 
ins returned the look with a steady 
gaze that seemed to say how 
much did he give you old boy 

whether sylvester translated the 
look in this manner it is difficult to 
tell but certain it is that as he poured 
a bumper from a fresh bottle of cham 
pagne he motioned the colonel to do 
the same and murmured in an absent 
manner or perhaps by way of a senti 
ment the remarkable words 

 fifty dollars egad that ill buy

plates for the next number offthe

chapter second 

mary the merchants daughter 

leaning gently forward her shawl 
falling carelessly from her shoulders 
and her bonnet thrown back from her 
brow the fair girl impressed a kiss on 
the cheek of her father while the 
glossy ringlets of her hair mingled 
their luxuriant brown with the white 
locks of the kind old man 

the father seated on the sofa his 
hands clasping her slight and delicate 
fingers looked up into her beaming 
face with a look of unspeakable affec 
tion while a warm glow of feeling 
flushed over the pale face of the mo 
ther a fine matronly dame of some 
forty-five who stood gazing on her 
daughter with one hand resting on 
the husband s shoulder 

the mild beams of an astral lamp 
diffused a softened and pleasing light 
through the parlor the large mirror 
glittering over the mantle the curtains 
of crimson silk depending along the 
windows the sofa on which the old 
man was seated the carpet of the 
finest texture the costly chairs the 
paintings that hung along the walls 
and in fine all the appointments of the 
parlor designated the abode of luxury 
and affluence 

the father who sate on the sofa 
gazing in the face of his child was a 
man of some sixty years with a fine 
venerable countenance wrinkled by 
care and time with thin locks of 
snow-white hair falling along his high 
pale forehead in his calm blue eys 
looking forth from the shadow of a 
thick grey eyebrow and in the gene 
ral contour of his face you rnigh 
trace as forcible a resemblance to his

the merchant s daughter 



daughter as ever was witnessed 
between an old man just passing 
away from life and a fair young 
girl blooming and blushing on the 
very threshold of womanhood the 
old man was clad in glossy black 
and his entire appearance marked 
the respectable merchant - who re- 
tirinj from active business sought 
in the quietude of his own home all 
the joys that life wealth or affection 
united and linked in blessings have in 
their power to bestow 

the mother who stood resting her 
hand on her husband s shoulder was 
we have said a fine matronly dame 
of forty-five a mild pale face a 
deep black eye and masses of raven 
hair slightly sprinkled with the silver 
threads of age parted over a calm 
forehead and tastefully disposed be 
neath a plain cap of lace gave the 
mother an appearance of sweetness 
and dignity combined that was emi 
nently effective in winning the respect 
and love of all who looked upon her 

 mary my child how lovely 
you have grown exclaimed the 
merchant in a deep quiet tone as he 
pressed her fair hands within his 
own and looked up in her face 

 nonsense you will make the 
child vain whispered the wife 
playfully yet her face flushed with 
affection and her eyes shone an 
answer to her husband s praise 

the girl was indeed beautiful 

as she stood there in that quiet 
parlor gazing in her father s face 
she looked like a breathing picture of 
youth girlhood and innocence painted 
by the finger of god her face was 
very beautiful the small bonnet 
thrown back from her forehead suf 



fered the rich curls of her brown hair 
to escape and they fell twining and 
glossy along each swelling cheek as 
though they loved to rest upon the 
velvet skin the features were re 
gular her lips were full red and ripe 
her round chin varied by a bewitching 
dimple and her eyes were large blue 
and eloquent with long and trembling 
lashes you looked in those eyes 
and felt that all the sunlight of a 
woman s soul was shining on you 
the face was lovely moist lovely the 
skin soft velvety blooming and 
transparent the eyes full of soul the 
lips sweet with the ripeness of maiden 
hood and the brow calm and white 
as alabaster yet was there no re 
markable manifestation of thought or 
mind or intellect visible in the lines 
of that fair countenance it was the 
face of a woman formed to lean to 
cling to love and never to lean on but 
one arm never to cling but to one 
bosom never to love but once and 
that till death and forever 

the fair round neck and well-de 
veloped bust shown to advantage in 
the close fitting dress of black silk 
the slender waist and the ripening 
proportions of her figure terminated 
by slight ancles and delicate feet all 
gave you the idea of a bud breaking 
into bloom a blossom ripening into 
fruit or what is higher and holier a 
pure and happy soul manifesting 
itself to the world through the round 
ed outlines of a woman s form 

 come come father you must not 
detain me any longer exclaimed 
the daughter in a sweet and low-toned 
voice you know aunt emily has 
been teasing me these two weeks ever 
since i returned from boarding-school 



mary 



 



to come and stay with her all night 
you know i was always a favorite 
with the dear old soul she wants to 
contrive some agreeable surprise for 
my birth-day i believe pm sixteen 
next christmas and that is three days 
off do let me go that s a good 
fecher 

had nt you better put on your 
cioak my love interrupted the mo 
ther regarding the daughter with a 
look of fond affection the night is 
very cold and you may suffer from 
exposure to the winter air 

 oh no no no mother replied 
the fair girl laughingly i do so 
hate these cloaks they re so bung 
ling and so heavy i ll just fling my 
shawl across my shoulders and run 
all the way to aunt emily s you 
know it s only two squares distant in 
third street 

 and then old lewey will see you 
safe to the door exclaime the mo 
ther well well go along my dear 
child take good care of yourself and 
give my love to your aunt 

 these old maids are queer things 
said the merchant with a smile 
 take care mary or aunt emily will 
find out all your secrets 

and the old man smiled pleasantly 
to himself for the idea of a girl so 
young so innocent having any secrets 
to be found out was too amusing to 
be entertained without a smile 

a shade fell over the daughters 
face so sudden and melancholy that 
her parents started with surprise 

 why do you look so sad my 
child exclaimed the father looking 
up in his daughter s face what is 
there in the world to sadden ow my 
mary 



nothing father nothing mur 
mured mary flinging her ibrm on her 
fathers bosom and twining her arms 
round his neck as she kissed him 
again and again only i was think 
ing just thinking of christmas 
and 

the fair girl rose suddenly from 
her fathers bosom and flung her arms 
hurriedly around her mother s neck 
imprinting kiss after kiss on her lips 

 good bye mother i ll be back 
i ll be back to-morrow 

and in an instant she glided hastily 
to the door and left the room 

 lewey is nt it very cold to night 
she asked as she observed the white- 
haired negro-servant waiting in the 
hall wrapped up in an enormous over 
coat with a comforter around his neck 
and a close fur cap surmounting his 
grey wool and chubby round face 
i m sorry to take you out in th 
cold lewey 

bress de baby s soul mur 
mured the old negro opening the door 
 habbent i nuss you in dese arms 
when you warnt so high lewey 
take cold debbil a cold dis nigger 
take for no price when a-waitin on 
missa mary 

mary stood upon the threshold of 
her home looking out into the cold 
starlit night her face was for a mo 
ment overshadowed by an expression 
of the deepest melancholy and her 
small foot trembled as it stepped over 
the threshold she looked hitrii dly 
along the gloomy street then cast her 
glance backwards into tne entry and 
then with a wild bound she retraced 
her steps and stood beside her father 
and her mother 

again she kissed them again flung 









 



the merchant s daughter 









her arms round their necks and again 
bounded along the entry crying laugh 
ingly to her parents good night 
good night i ll be back to-mor 
row 

again she stood upon the threshold 
but all traces of laughter had vanished 
from her face she was sad and si 
lent and there were tears in her eyes 
at least the old negro said so after 
wards and also that her tiny foot 
when resting on the door-sill trembled 
like any leaf 

why should her eye grow dim with 
tears and her foot tremble would 
not that tiny foot when next it crossed 
the threshold bound forward with a 
gladsome movement as the bride 
sprung to meet her father and her 
mother once again would not that 
calm blue eye now filled with tears 
grow bright with a joy before un 
known when it glanced over the hus 
bands form as for the first time he 
stood in the fathers presence would 
not christmas eve be a merry night 
for the bride and all her friends as 
they went shouting merrily through 
the luxuriantly furnishod chambers of 
her fathers mansion why should 
she fear to cross the threshold of her 
home when her coming back was to 
be heralded with blessings and crown- 
with love 

how will the future answer these 
trembling questions of that stainless 
heart 

she crossed the threshold and not 
daring to look back hurried along the 
gloomy street it was clear cold 
starlight and the pathways were com 
paratively deserted the keen winter 
wind nipped her cheek and chilled 



seemed smiling her onward and she 
fancied the good angels that ever 
watch over woman s first and world- 
trusting love looking kindly upon her 
from the skies 

after traversing third street for 
some two squares she stood before an 
ancient three-storied dwelling at the 



corner of third and 



streets 



with the name of miss e graham 
on the door plate 

leweyyou need nt wait she 
said kindly yet not without a deeper 
motive than kindness to the aged 
negro who had attended her thus far 

i ll ring the bell myself you 
had better hurry home and warm 
yourself and remember lewey tell 
father and mother that they need not 
expect me home before to-morrow at 
noon good night lewey 

 good night missa mary lor

thus murmuring lewey trudged 
on his way leaving mary standing in 
front of aunt emily s door did she 
pull the bell i trow not for no 
sooner was the negro out of sight than 
the tall figure of a woman dressea in 



for form but above her the stars black with a long veil drooping over 



byrnewood and lorrimer 



ner face glided round the corner and 
stood by her side 

 oh bessie is that you 
cried mary in a trembling voice 
 i m so frightened i don t know what 
to do oh bessie bessie don t you 
think i had better turn back 

he waits for you said the 
strange woman in a husky voice 

mary hurriedly laid her hand on the 
stranger s arm her face was over 
spread with a sudden expression of 
feeling like a gleam of sunshine seen 
through a broken cloud on a stormy 
day and in a moment they were 
speeding down third street toward 
the southern districts of the quaker 
city another moment and the eye 
might look for them in vain 

and as they disappeared the state 
house clock rung out the hour of 
nine this as the reader will per 
ceive was just four hours previous to 
the time when byrnewood and lorri- 
mer closed their wager in the subterra 
nean establishment along chesnut 
street to the wager and its result 
we now turn our attention and the 
readers interest 



chapter third 

byrnewood and lorrimer 

the harsh sound of their footsteps 
resounding along the frozen pavement 
awoke the echoes of the state house 
buildingsas linked arm in arm byrne- 
wood and lorrimer hurried along 
chesnut street their figures thrown in 
lengthened shadow by the beams of 
the setting moon 



the tall manly arid muscular figure 
of lorrimer attired in a close-fitting 
black overcoat presented a fine con 
trast to the slight yet well-proportioned 
form of byrnewood which now and 
then became visible as the wind flung 
his voluminous cloak back from his 
shoulders the firm and measured 
stride of lorrimer the light and agile 
footstep of byrnewood the glowing 
countenance of the magnificent gus 
the pale solemn face of the young 
merchant the rich brown hair which 
hung in clustering masses around the 
brow of the first and the long dark 
hair which fell sweeping to the very 
shoulders of his companion all 
furnished the details of a vivid con 
trast worthy the effective portraiture 
of a master in ourfeister-aro 

 almost as cold as charity byrne 
wood my boy exclaimed lorri 
mer as he gathered byrnewood s arm 
more closely within his own do 
you know my fellow that i believe 
vastly in faces 

how so 

 i can tell a man s character from 
his face the moment i clap my eye 
on him i like or dislike at first sight 
now there s silly petriken s face 
how do you translate it 

the fact is lorrimer i know 
very little about him i was intro 
duced to him for the first time at a 
party where he was enrapturing some 
sentimental old maids with a few 
quires of sonnets on every thing in 
general since that occasion i have 
never met him until to-night when 
he hailed me in chesnut street and 
forced me into mutchins room at the 
united states hotel you know the 
rest 



 



the merchant s daughter 






well well ith regard to petri- 
ken a single word clever fellow 
clever but like mutchins he sells for 
a reasonable price i buy them both 
by jupiter the town swarms with such 
fellows who will sell themselves to 
any master for a trifle petriken 
poor fellow his face indicates his 
character a solemn pimp a senten 
tious parasite mutchins is just the 
other way an agreeable jolly old- 
dog of a pander they hire them 
selves to me for the season i use 
and of course despise them 

 you re remarks are truly flatter 
ing to these worthy gentlemen said 
byrnewood drily 

 and now my fellow you may 
think me insincere but i tell you 
frankly that the moment i first saw 
your face i liked you and resolved 
you should be my friend for your 
sake i am about to do a thing which 
i would do for no living man and 
possibly no dead one 

 and that is interrupted byrne- 
wood 

just listen my fellow did you 
s ever hear any rumors of a queer old 
house down town kept by a reputable 
old lady and supported by the purses 
of goodly citizens whose names you 
never hear without the addition of 
 respectable celebrated or ha 
ha pious mosi l pious a 
queer old house my good fellow 
where during the long hours of the 
winter nights your husband so kind 
and good forgets his wife your mer 
chant his ledger your lawyer his 
quibbles your parson his prayers a 
queer old house my good fellow 
where wine and woman mingle their 
attractions where at once you sip the 



honey from a red-lip and a sparkling 
bubble from the champagne where 
luxuriantly-furnished chambers re 
sound all night long with the rustling 
of cards or the clink of glasses or 
it may be the gentle ripple of 
voices murmuring in a kiss a 
queer old house my dear fellow in 
short where the very devil is played 
under a cloak and sin grows fat with 
in the shelter of quiet rooms and im 
penetrable walls s 

 ha ha lorrimer you are elo 
quent faith i ve heard some rumors 
of such a queer old house but always 
deemed them fabulous 

 the old house is a fact my boy 
a fact i within its walls this night i 
will wed my pretty bride and within 
its walls my fellow despite the pains 
and penalties of our club you shall 
enter 

 i should like it of all things in the 
world how is your club styled 

 all in good time my friend each 
member you see once a week has 
the privilege of introducing a friend 
the same friend must never enter 
the club house twice now i have 
rather overstepped the rules of the 
club in other respects it will require 
all my tact to pass you in to-night 
it shall be done however and mark 
me you will obtain a few fresh ideas 
of the nature ofthe secret life of this 
good quaker city j 

why lorrimer exclaimed 
byrnewood as they approached the 
corner of eighth and chesnut you 
seem to have a pretty good idea ol 
life in general 

life echoed the magnificent 
gus in that tone of enthusiasm pecu 
liar to the convivialist when recover- 



byrnewood and lorrimer 



 



ing from the first excitement of the 
bottle life what is it as 
brilliant and as brief as a champagne 
bubble to day a jolly carouse in an 
oyster cellar to-morrow a nice little 
pic nic party in a grave-yard one 
moment you gather the apple the 
next it is ashes every thing fleeting 
apd nothing stable every thing shift 
ing and changing and nothing substan 
tial j a bundle of hopes and fears 
deceits and confidences joys and 
miseries strapped to a fellow s back 
like pedlar s wares 

 huzza bravo the reverend 
gus lorrimer preaches and what 
moral does your reverence deduce 
from all this 

one word my fellow enjoy 
enjoy till the last nerve loses its deli 
cacy of sense enjoy till the last sinew 
ie unstrung enjoy till the eye flings out 
its last glance till the voice cracks and 
the blood stagnates enjoy always 
enjoy and at last 

 aye aye that terrible at last 

n 

 at last when you can enjoy no 
longer creep into a nice cozy house 
ome eight feet deep by six long and 
two wide wrap yourself up in a com 
fortable quilt of white and tell the 
worms those jolly gleaners of the 
scraps of the feast of life that they 
may fall to and be d d to em 

 ha ha lorrimer who 
would have thought this of you 

 tell me my fellow what busi- 
nes do you follow 

 rather an abrupt question how- 
 cvei i m the junior partner in the 
importing house of livingston har- 
irey co along front street 

 and i replied gustavus slow 



ly and with deliberation nd am 
junior and senior partner m a snug 
little wholesale business of my own 
the firm is lorrimer co the 
place of business is everywhere about 
town and the business itself is en 
joyment nothing but enjoyment 
wine and woman forever and as 
for the capital i ve an unassuming 
sum of one hundred thousand dollars 
am independent of all relations and 
bid fair to live at least a score of years 
longer now my fellow you know 
me come spice us up a few of your 
own secrets have you no interest 
ing little amour for my private ear 

 by heaven i d forgotten all about 
it cried bynewood starting aside 
from his companion as they stood in 
the full glare of the gas-lamp at the 
corner of eighth and chesnut street 
i d forgotten all about the letter 

 the letter what letter 

 why just before petriken hailed 
me in chesnut street this evening 
or rather last evening a letter was 
placed in my hands which i neglected 
to read i know the handwriting on 
the direction however it s from a 
dear little love of a girl who some six 
months ago was afsejvantvin my 
father s house a sweet girl lorri 
mer and you know how these 
things work she was lovely inno- 
ent and too confiding and i was but 
a man j 

and she a slower rather a 
low walk of business for you my bey i 
however let s read the letter by iamp- 
light- 

 here it is lt dear byrnewood 
 would like very much to see you to 
night i am in great distress meet 
me at the corner of fourth and ches- 



the merchant s daughter 



nut streets at nine o clock or you will 
regret it to the day of your death oh 
gtr god s sake do meet me annie 
what a pretty hand she writes eh 
lorrimer that for god s sake is 
rather cramped and egad there s 
the stain of a tear 

 these things are quite customary 
these letters and these tears the 
dear little women can only use these 
arguments when they yield too much 
to our persuasions 

and yet d n the thing 

how unfortunate for the girl my ac 
quaintance has proved she had to 
leave my father s house on account o 

of the circumstance becoming 
too apparent and her parents are very 
poor i should have liked to have 
seen her to-night however it will 
do in the morning and now lorri 
mer which way 

 to the queer old house down 
town by the bye there goes the 
state house one o clock by jupi 
ter we ve two good hours yet to 
decide the wager let s spend hal 
an hour in a visit to a certain friend 
of mine here byrnewood let me 
instruct you in the mysteries of the 
lark 

and leaning aside the magnificent 
gus whispered in the ear of his friend 
with as great an appearance of m 
as the most profound secret might 
supposed to demand 

 do you take my fellow 

capital capital replied byrne- 
wood crushing the letter into his 
pocket we shall crowd this night 
with adventures that s certain 

the dawn of daylight it is true 

closed the accounts of a night 
somewhat crowded with incidents 



did these merry gentlemen who stood 
laughing so cheerily at the corner 
eighth and chesnut streets at the hour 
of one their faces glowing in the light 
of the midnight moon did they guess 
the nature of the incidents which five 
o clock in the morning could disclose 
god of heaven might no angel of 
mercy drop from the skies and warn 
them back in their career 

no warning came no omen scared 
them back passing down eighth 
street they turned up walnut which 
they left at thirteenth turning dowr 
thirteenth they presently stood before 
a small old fashioned two storied 
building with a green door and a bulli 
window that occupied nearly the en 
tire width of the front protruding ill 
the light a tin sign placed betweeft 
the door and window bore the inscrip- 
tion astrologer 

 wonder if the old cove s in bed 
exclaimed lorrimer and as he spoktt 
the green door opened as if in answer 
to his question and the figure of a man 
muffled up in the thick folds of a cloak 
with his hat drawn over his eyes 
glided out of the astrologer s house 
and hurried down thirteenth street 

 ha ha devilish cunning but 
not so cunning as he thinks laughed 
byrnewood i saw his face it s 
old grab-and-snatch the president of 

the bank which every body 

says is on the eve of a grand blow 
up i 

the respectable old gentleman 
has been consulting the stars with re 
gard to the prospects of his bank 
h a ha however my boy the 
door is open let s enter let s 
consult this familiar of the fates this 
intimate acquaintance of the future 



the astrologer 



chapter fourth 

the astrologer 

n a small room remarkable for 
the air of comfort imparted by the 
combined effects of the neatly white 
washed walls the floor plainly carpet 
ed and the snug little wood-stove 
roaring in front of the hearth sat 
a man of some forty-five winters 
bending over the table in the corner 
covered with strange-looking books 
and loose manuscripts 

the light of the iron lamp which 
stood in the centre of the table resting 
on a copy of cornelius agrippa fell 
full and strongly over the face and 
form of the astrologer disclosing 
every line of his countenance and 
illumining the corner where he sat 
while the more distant parts of the 
room were comparatively dim and 
shadowy 

as he sat in the large old-fashioned 
arm-chair bending down earnestly 
oyertji massive manuscript covered 
with strange characters and crossed 
by intricate lines the lampbeams dis 
closed a face which somewhat plain 
and unmeaning in repose was now 
agitated by an expression of the deep 
est interest the brow neither very 
high nor very low shaded by tangled 
locks of thin brown hair was corru 
gated with deep furrows the eye 
brows were firmly set together the 
nostrils dilated and the lips tightly 
compressed while the full grey eyes 
staring vacantly on the manuscript 
indicated by the glassy film spread 
over each pupil that the mind of the 
astrologer instead of being occupied 
with outward objects was buried with 



in itself in tne contemplation of some 
intricate subject of thought 

there was nothing in the dress of 
the man or in the appearance of his 
room that might realize the ideas 
commonly attached to the astrologer 
and his den here were no melo 
dramatic curtains swinging solemnly 
to and fro brilliant and terrible with 
the emblazoned death s-head and cross- 
bones here were no blue lights 
imparting a lurid radiance o a row of 
grinning skeletons here were no 
ghostly forms standing pale and erect 
their glassy eyes freezing the specta 
tor s blood with horror here was 
neither goblin devil or mischievous 
ape which as every romance reader 
knows have been the companions of 
the astrologer from time immemorial 
here was nothing but a plain man 
seated in an old-fashioned arm chair 
within the walls of a comfortable room 
warmed by a roaring little stove 

no cap of sable relieved the astro 
loger s brow no gown of black velvet 
tricked out with mysterious emblems 
in gold and precious stones fell in 
sweeping folds around the outlines of 
his spare figure a plain white over 
coat much worn and out at the elbows 
a striped vest no remarkable for its 
shape or fashion a cross-barred neck 
erchief and a simple linen shirt collar 
completed the attire of the astrologer 
who sat reading at the table 

the walls of the room were hung 
with the horoscopes of illustrious 
men washington byron and napo 
leon delineated on large sheets of 
paper and surrounded by plain frames 
of black wood the table was piled 
with the works of sibly lilly cor 
nelius agrippa and other masters in 



the merchant s daughter 



the mystic art while at the feet of 
the astrologer nestled a fine black cat 
whose large whiskers and glossy fur 
would seem to afford no arguments in 
favor of the supposition entertained by 
the neighbors that she was a devil in 
disguise a sort of familiar spirit on 
leave of absence from the infernal re 
gions 

i m but a poor man said the 
astrologer turning one of the leaves 
of the massive volume in manuscript 
which he held in his hand i m 
but a poor man and the lawyer and 
the doctor and the parson all despise 
me and yet his lip wreathed with 
a sneering smile this little room 
has seen them all within its walls 
begging from the humble man some 
knowledge of the future here they 
come one and all the fools pre 
tending to despise my science and yet 
willing to place themselves in my 
power while they affect to doubt 
ha-ha here are their nativities one 
and all that he continued turn 
ing over a leaf is the horoscope 
of a clergyman -r- holy man of god 
he wanted to know whether he 
could ruin an innocent girl in his con 
gregation without discovery and 
that is the horoscope of a lawyer who 
takes fees from both sides his desire 
is to know whether he can perjure 
himself in a case now in court without 
detection noble counsellor this 
doctor and he turned over another 
leaf told me that he had a delicate 
case m hand a pretty girl has 
been ruined and so on the seducer 
wants to destroy the fruit of his crime 
and desires the doctor to undertake 
the job doctor wants to know what 
moment will be auspicious ha-ha 



and thus turning from page to page 
he disclosed the remarkable fact that- 
the great the good and the wise of 
the quaker city who met the mere 
name of astrology when uttered ill 
public with a most withering sneer 
still under the cover of night were- 
happy to steal to the astrologer s 
room and obtain some glimpses of 
their future destiny through the oracle 
of the stars 

 a black-eyed woman lusty and 
amorous wants to know whether 
she can present her husband with a 
pair of horns on a certain night i 
warned her not to proceed in her 
course of guilt she does proceed 
and will be exposed to her husband s 
hate and public scorn 

and thus murmuring the astrologer 
turned to another leaf 

 the horoscope of a puppy-faced 
editor a spaniel a snake and an 
ape he is a combination of the three 
wants to know when he can run off 
with a lady of the ballet at the theatre 
without being caught by his creditors 
also whether next thursday is an 
auspicious day for a little piece of 
roguery he has in view the peni 
tentiary looms darkly in the distance 

let the editor of the daily black 
mail beware 

another leaf inscribed with a dis 
tinguished name arrested the astrolo 
gers attention 

 ha ha this fellow is a man 
of fashion a buck of chesnut street 
and and a colonel he lives 
know how the fashionables who 
follow in his wake don t dream of his 
means of livelihood he has conv- 
mitted a crime an astounding crime 

wants to know whether his asso- 



the astrologer 



ciate will betray him i told him he 
would the colonel laughed at me 
although he paid for the knowledge 
in a week the fine sweet perfumed 
gentleman will be lodged at public ex 
pense 

the astrologer laid down the 
volume and in a moment seemed to 
have fallen into the same train of 
thought marked by the corrugated 
brow and glassy eye tha occupied 
his mind at the commencement of 
this scene his lips moved tremulous 
ly and his hands ever and anon were 
pressed against his wrinkled brow 
every moment his eye grew more 
glassy and his mouth more fixedly 
compressed and at last leaning his 
elbows on the table with his hands 
nervously clasped his gaze was fixed 
on the blank wall opposite in a wild 
and vacant stare that betrayed the 
painful abstraction of his mind from 
all visible objects 

and as he sat there enwrapt in 
thought a footstep inaudible to his 
ear creaked on the stairway that as 
cended into the astrologer s chamber 
from the room below and in a mo 
ment silent and unperceived gus lor- 
rimer stood behind his chair looking 
over his head his very breath hushed 
and his hands upraised 

in all my history i remember 
nothing half so strange- all is full of 
light except one point of the future 
and that is dark as death thus 
ran the murmured soliloquy of the 
astrologer and yet they will be 
here to-night here here both of 
them or there s no truth in the stars 
lorrimer must beware 

ha -ha ha laughed a bold 



and manly voice an old stage 
trick that you didn t hear my foot 
steps on the stairs did you oh no 
oh no of course you didn t 
come come my old boy that clap- 
trap mention of my name is rather 
too stale even for a three-fipenny- bit 
melo-drama 

the sudden start which the astro 
loger gave the unaffected look of sur 
prise which flashed over his features 
at the sight of the gentleman of plea 
sure convinced lorrimer that he had 
done him rank injustice 

sit down sir i have much to 
say to you said the astrologer in 
a voice strikingly contrasted with his 
usual tone it was so deep so full and 
so calmly deliberate last thurs 
day morning at this hour you gave 
me the day and hour of your birth 
you wished me to cast your horo 
scope you wished to know whether 
you would be successful in an enter- 
prise which you meditated am i cor 
rect in this 

you are my old humbug that 
is my friend replied lorrimer 
flinging himself into a seat 

 humbug cried the other with a 
quiet sneer you may alter your 
opinion after a-while my young friend 
since last thursday morning i have 
given the most careful attention to 
your horoscope it is one of the most 
startling that ever i beheld you were 
born under one of the most favorable 
aspects of the heavens born it would 
seem but to succeed in all your 
wishes and yet your future fate is 
wrapt in some terrible mystery 

 like a kitten in a wet blanket for 
instance said lorrimer in the vain 



the merchant s daughter 



endeavor lo shake off a strange feel 
ing of awe produced by the manner 
of the astrologer 

this night i was occupied with 
your horoscope when a strange cir 
cumstance attracted my attention 
even while i was examining book 
after book in the effort to see more 
clearly into your future i discovered 
that you were making a new acquain 
tance at some festival some wine- 
drinking or other affair of the kind 
this new acquaintance is a man with 
a pale face long dark hair and dark 

eyes so the stars tell me your fate 
and the fate of this young man are 
linked together till death so the 
heavens tell me and the heavens 
never lie 

 yes yes my friend very 
good replied gustavus with a 
smile very good my dear sir 
your conclusions are perfect your 
prophetic gift without reproach but 
you forget one slight circumstance 
i have made no new acquaintance to 
night i have been at no wine-drink 
ing i have seen no interesting young 
man with a pale face and long dark 
hair 

 then my science is a lie ex 
claimed the astrologer with a puzzled 
look the stars declare that this 
very night you first came in contact 
with the man whose fate henceforth is 
linked with your own the future 
has a doom in store for one of ye 
the stars do not tell me which shall 
feel the terror of the doom but that it 
will be inflicted by one of ye upon the 
other is certain 

 well let us suppose for the sake 
of argument that i did meet this 



mysterious young man with long black 
hair what follows 

three days ago a young man 
whose appearance corresponds with 
the indication given by the stars of the 
new acquaintance you were to make 
this very night came to me and de 
sired me to cast his horoscope the 
future of this young man is as like 
yours as night is to-night he too is 
threatened with a doom either to be 
suffered or inflicted this doom will 
lower over his head within three days 
at the hour of sunset on next satur 
day christmas eve a terrible 
calamity will overtake him at the 
same hour and in the same manner 
a terrible calamity will blacken your 
life forever the same doubt prevails 
in both cases whether you will en 
dure this calamity in your own per- 
son or be the means of inflicting its 
horrors on some other man doomed 
and fated by the stars 

 what connection has this young 
man with the new acquaintance 
which you say i have formed to 
night 

 suspect that this young man 
and your new acquaintance are one 
if so i warn you by your soul 
beware of him this stranger to you 

 and why beware of me said a 
calm and quiet voice at the shoulder 
of the astrologer 

as though a shell had burst in the 
centre of that quiet room he started 
he trembled and arose to his feet 
byrnewood the young merchant 
calm and silent stood beside him 

 i warn ye he shrieked in a 
tone of wild excitement with his grey 
eyes dilating and flashing beneath 






the astrologer 



 






the woven eyebrows i warn ye 
both beware of each other let 
this meeting at my house be your last 
on earth and ye are saved meet 
again or pursue any adventure to 
gether and ye are lost and lost for 
ever i tell ye scornful men that ye 
are that ask my science to aid you 
and then mock its lessons i tell ye 
by the living god who writes his 
will in letters of fire on the wide scroll 
of the firmament that in the hand of 
the dim future is a goblet steeped in 
the bitterness of death and that goblet 
one or the other must drink within 
three little days 

and striding wildly along the room 
while byrne wood stood awed and 
even the cheek of lorrimer grew 
pale he gave free impulse to one of 
those wild deliriums of excitement 
peculiar to his long habits of abstrac 
tion and thought the full truth the 
terrible truth seemed crowding on his 
brain arrayed in various images of 
horror and he shrieked forth his in 
terpretation of the future in wild and 
broken sentences 

 young man three days ago you 
sought to know the future you had 
never spoken to the man who sits in 
yonder chair i cast your horoscope 
i found your destiny like the des 
tiny of this man who affects to sneer 
at my science my art availed me no 
fuither i could not identify you with 
the man who first met lorrimer this 
night amid revelry and wine now 
i can supply the broken chain you 
and his new-formed acquaintance are 
one and now the light of the stars 
breaks more plainly on me within 
three days one of you will die by the 
other hand 



lorrimer slowly arose to his feet 
as though the effort gave him pain 
his cheek was pale and beaded drops 
of sweat stood on his brow his 
parted lips his upraised hands and 
flashing eyes attested his interest in 
the astrologer s words meanwhile 
starting suddenly aside byrnewood 
veiled his face in his hands as his 
breast swelled and quivered witn sud 
den emotion 

stern and erect in his plain white 
overcoat untrjcked with gold or gems 
stood the astrologer his tangled brown 
hair flung back from his brow while 
with his outstretched hand and flash 
ing eye he spoke forth the fierce 
images of his brain 

 three days from this as the sun 
goes down on christmas eve one of 
you will die by the other s hand as 
sure as there is a god in heaven his 
stars have spoken and it will be so 

 what will be the manner of the 
death exclaimed lorrimer in a 
low-toned voice as he endeavored to 
subdue the sudden agitation inspired 
by the astrologer s words while 
byrnewood raised his head and awaited 
the answer with evident interest 

 there is the cloud and the mys 
tery exclaimed the astrologer 
fixing his eye on vacancy while his 
outstretched hand trembled like a leaf 
in the wind the death will over 
take the doomed man on a river and 
yet it will not be by water it will kill 
him by means of fire and yet he will 
not perish in the midst of flames 

there was a dead pause for a single 
instant there stood the astrologer 
his features working as with a con 
vulsive spasm the light falling boldly 
over his slight figure and homely attire 






the merchant s daughter 



and there at his side gazing in his 
face stood byrnewood the young 
merchant silent as if a speil had fallen 
on him while on the other side gus 
tavus lorrimer half recoiling his 
brow woven in a frown and his dark 
eyes flashing with a strange glance 
seemed making a fearful effort to com 
mand his emotion and dispel the gloom 
which the wierd prophecy had flung 
over his soul 

pah what fools we are to 
stand here listening to the ravings 
a madman or a knave cried 
byrnewood with a forced laugh as 
he shook off the spell that seemed to 
bind him what does he know o 
the future more than we eh 
lorrimer perhaps sir since you 
are so familiar with fate destiny and 
all that you can tell us the nature o 
the adventure on which lorrimer is 
bound to-night 

the astrologer turned and looked 
upon him there was something so 
calmly scornful in his glance that 
byrnewood averted his eyes 

 the adventure is connected with 
the honor of an innocent woman 
said the astrologer more than this 
i know not save that a foul outrage 
will be done this very night and 
hark ye sir either the heavens are 
false or your future destiny hangs 
upon this adventure give up the ad 
venture at once go back in your 
course part from one another part

chapter fifth 

dora livingstone 

it was a nice cozy place that old 
counting-house room with its smoky 
walls its cheerful coal-fire burning in 
the rusty grate and its stained and 
blackened floor a snug little room 
illuminated by a gas-light subdued to 
a shadowy and sleepy brilliancy with 
the merchant s almanac and four or 
five old pictures scattered along the 
walls an old oaken desk with im 
mense legs all carved and curled into 
a thousand shapes standing in one 
corner and a massive door whose 
glass window opened a mysterious 
view into the regions of the ware 
house where casks of old cogniac lay 
side by side in lengthened rows like 
jolly old fellows a a party as they 
whisper quietly to one another on the 
leading questions of the day 

seated in front of the coal fire 
his legs elevated above his head rest 
ing on the mantel-piece a gentleman 
of some twenty-fivs years with his 



arms crossed and a pipe in his mouth 
seemed engaged in an earnest endea 
vour to wrap himself up in a cloak of 
tobacco smoke in order to prepare for 
a journey into the land of nod while 
the tumbler of punch standing on the 
small table at his elbow showed that 
he was by no means opposed to that 
orthodox principle which recognizes 
the triple marriage of brandy lemon 
and sugar as a highly necessary ad 
dition to the creature comforts of the 
human being in no way to be despised 
or neglected by thinking men 

you would not have called this gen 
tleman well-proportioned and yet his 
figure was long and slender you could 
not have styled his dress eminently 
fashionable and yet his frock coat was 
shaped of the finest black cloth you 
would not have looked upon his face 
as the most handsome in the world 
and yet it was a finely-marked counte- 
nance with a decided if not highly 
intellectual expression if the truth 
must be told his coat though fashion 
ed of the finest tloth was made a lit 
tle too full in one place a little too 
scant in another and buttoned up 
somewhat too high in the throat for a 
gentleman whose ambition it was 
flourish on the southern side of 
nut street amid the animate as 
and silks of a fashionable r nade 
and then the large bla ck en 

circling his neck wit crumpled 
hough snow-white collar gave 

a harsh relief countenance 
while the ca y-disposed wrist 
bands crushes ack over the upturned 
cuffs of his coat designated the man 
who went in for comfort and flung 
p ashion to the haberdashers and dry 
goods clerks 



the merchant s dau-ghter 



full out 



as for his face whenever the cur 
tain of tobacco smoke rolled aside you 
oeheld as i have said a finely-marked 
countenance with rather lank cheeks 
a sharp aquiline nose thin lips biting 
and sarcastic in expression a 
square chin and eyes of the peculiar 
class intensely dark and piercing in 
their glance that remind you of a 
flame without heat cold glittering and 
snake-like his forehead was high 
and bold with long and lanky black 
hair falling back from its outlines and 
resting without love-lock or curl in 
straight masses behind each ear 

 queer world this began our 
comfortable friend falling into one of 
those broken soliloquies generated by 
the pipe and the bowl in which the 
stops are supplied by puffs of smoke 
and the paragraph terminated by a sip 
of the punch don t know much 
about other worlds but it strikes me 
that if a prize were offered somewhere 
by somebody for the queerest world 
a-going this world of ours might be 
rigged up nice and sent in like a bit 
of show beef as the premium queer 
world no man smokes a cigar that 
ever tried a pipe but an ass i was

another sip of the punch and i m off 
ha ha good idea that of the hand 
some colonel great buck man of 
fashion and long-haired apollo called 
here this evening to see me smelt 
like a civet cat must flourish his 
pocket-book before my eyes by way of 
a genteel brag dropped a letter from 



dora livingstone 



a bundle of notes valuable letter tbat 
wouldn t part with it for a cool thou 
sand rather think it will raise thlt 
devil let me see 

and laying down his pipe mr luke 
harvey drew a neatly-folded billet- 
doux from an inside pocket of his 
coat and holding it in the glare of the 
light perused its direction which was 
written in a fair and delicate woman s 
hand 

 col fitz-cowles united states 
hotel he murmured good idea 
colonel to drop such a letter out of 
your pocket-book won t trouble you 
none spose not ha ha ha 
d d good idea 

the idea appeared to tickle him 
immensely for he chuckled in a deep 
self-satisfied tone as he drew on his 
bearskin overcoat and even while he 
extinguished the gas-light and covered 
up the fire his chuckle grew into a 
laugh which deepened into a hearty 
guffaw as striding through the dark 
warehouse he gained the front door 
and looked out into the deserted street 

 ha-ha-ha to drop such a dear 
creature s letter he laughed lock 
ing the door of the warehouse 
 wonder if it won t raise h i 
toved a woman once luke you were 

a d d fool that time jilted yes 

jilted that s the word i believe 
maybe i won t have my revenge 
perhaps not very likely not 

with this momentous letter so 
carelessly dropped by the insinuating 
millionaire colonel fitz-cowles rest 
ing on his mind and stirring his fea 
tures with frequent spasmodic attacks 
of laughter our friend mr hrvey 
pursued his way along front street 
and turning up chesnut street arrived 
 



at the corner of third where he halt 
ed for a few moments in order to 
ascertain the difference in time between 
his gold-repeater and the state house 
clock which had just struck one 

while thus engaged intently peru 
sing the face of his watch by the light 
of the moon a stout middle-aged gen 
tleman wrapped up in a thick over 
coat with a carpet bag in his hand 
came striding rapidly across the street 
and for a moment stood silent and 
unperceived at his shoulder 

 well luke is the repeater right 
and the state house wrong said a 
hearty cheerful voice and the middle- 
aged gentleman laid his hand on mr 
harvey s shoulder 

 ah-ha mr livingstone is that 
you cried luke suddenly wheeling 
round and gazing into the frank and 
manly countenance of the new-comer 

 when did you get back from new 
york 

 just this moment arrived i did 
not expect to return within a week 
from this time and therefore come 
upon you by a little surprise i wrote 
to mrs l yesterday telling her i 
would not be in town until the christ 
mas holidays were over she ll be 
rather surprised to see me i suppose 

 rather echoed luke drily 

 come luke take my arm and 
et s walk up toward my house i 
rave much to say to you in the first 
place have you any thing new 

while mr harvey is imparting his 
budget of news to the senior partner 
f the firm of livingstone harvey 
co as they stroll slowly along ches 
nut street we will make some few 
notes of his present appearance 

stout muscular and large-boned 



the merchant s daughter 



with x figure slightly inclining towards 
corpulence mr livingstone strode 
along the pavement with a firm and 
measured step that attested all the 
matured strength and vigor peculiar 
to robust middle age he was six 
feet high with broad shoulders and 
muscular chest his face was full 
bold and massive rather bronzed in 
hue and bearing some slight traces of 
the ravages of small -pox once or 
twice as he walked along he lifted 
his hat from his face and his fore 
head rendered more conspicuous by 
some slight baldness was exposed to 
view it was high and wide and 
massive bulging outward prominently 
in the region of the reflective organs 
and faintly relieved by his short brown 
hair his eyes bold and large of a 
calm clear blue were rendered strange 
ly expressive by the contrast of the 
jet-black eyebrows his nose was 
firm and roman in contour his mouth 
marked by full and determined lips 
his chin square and prominent while 
the lengthened outline of the lower 
jaw from the chin to the ear gave 
his countenance an expression of in 
flexible resolution in short it was 
the face of a man whose mind great 
in resources had only found room for 
the display of its tamest powers in 
enlarged mercantile operations while 
its dark and desperate elements from 
the want of adversity revenge or hate 
to rouse them into action had lain still 
and dormant for some twenty long 
years of active life he never dream 
ed himself that he carried a hidden 
hell within his soul 
 had this man been born poor it is 
probable that in his attempt to rise 
the grini hand of want would have 



dragged from their lurking-places 
these dark and fearful elements of his 
being but wealth had lapped him at 
his birth smiled on him in his youth 
walked by him through life and the 
moment for the trial of all his powers 
had never happened he was a fine 
man a noble merchant and a good 
citizen we but repeat the stereo 
typed phrases of the town and yet 
quiet and close near the heart of this 
cheerful-faced man lay a sleeping 
devil who had been dozing away 
there all his life and only waiting the 
call of destiny to spring into terrible 
action and rend that manly bosom 
with his fangs 

 have you heard any news of the 
forger asked luke harvey when 
he had delivered his budget of news 
 any intelligence of the respectable 
gentleman in the white cravat and 
hump-back 

 he played the same game in new 
york that he played in our city 
wherever i went i heard nothing but 
mr ellis mortimer of charleston 
bought goods to a large amount here 
on the strength of a letter of credit 
drawn on your house by grayson 
ballenger co or that lt mr mor 
timer bought goods to a large amount 
in such-and-such a-store backed by 
the same letter of credit no less 
than twelve wholesale houses gave 
him credit to an almost unlimited ex 
tent in all cases the goods were 
despatched to the various auctions and 
sold at half-cost while mr ellis mor 
timer pocketed the cash 

 and you have no traces of this 
prince of swindlers 

 none all the police in new york 
have been raising heaven-and-earth to 



dora llvingstonfc 



catch him for this week past but with 
out success at last i have come to 
the conclus on that he is lurking about 
this city with the respectable sum of 
two hundred thousand dollars in his 
possession i am half-inclined to be 
lieve that he is not alone in this busi 
ness there may be a combination 
of scoundrels concerned in the affair 
to-morrow the police shall ransack 
every hiding-hole and cranny in the 
city my friend col fitz-cowles 
gave me some valuable suggestions 
before i left for new york i will 
ask his advice in regard to the matter 
the first thing in the morning 

 very fine man that col fitz- 
cowles observed luke as they 
turned down fourth street splen 
did fellow dresses well gives 
capital terrapin suppers at the united 
states inoculates all the bucks about 
town with his style of hat capital 
fellow son of an english earl 
ain t he mr livingstone 

so i have understood replied 
mr livingstone not exactly liking the 
quiet sneer which lurked under the 
innocent manner of his partner a 
least so it is rumored 

 got lots of money a millionaire 
no end to his wealth by the bye 
where the d did he come from 



tsn t he a southern planter with acres 
of niggers and prairies of cotton 

 luke that s a very strange ques 
tion to ask me you just now asked 
me whether he was the son of an 
english earl did nt you 

 believe i did to tell the truth 
i ve heard both stories about him and 
some dozen more an heir-apparent 
to an english earldom a rich planter 
from the south the son of a boston 



magnifique the only child of a rich 
mexican these things you will see 
don t mix well who the devil is our 
long-haired friend anyhow 

tut-tut luke this is all folly 
you know that col fitz-cowles is re 
ceived in the best society mingles with 
the ton of the quaker city is squired 
about by our judges and lawyers and 
can always find scores of friends to 
help him spend his fortune 



 fine man that col fitz-cowles 
very said the other in his dry and 
biting tone 

 do you know luke that i think 
the married men the happiest in the 
world said livingstone drawing 
the arm of his partner closely within 
his own now look at my case for 
instance a year ago i was a mise 
rable bachelor the loss of one hun 
dred thousand dollars then would have 
driven me frantic now i have a 
sweet young wife to cheer me her 
smile welcomes me home the first 
tone of her voice and my loss is for 
gotten 

the merchant paused his eye 
t glistened with a tear and he felt his 
heart grow warm in his bosom as the 
vision of his sweet young wife nom 
so calmly sleeping on her solitary bed 
rose before him he imagined he 
smile of welcome as she beheld hio 
suddenly appear by her bedside he- 
felt her arms so full and round twjiing 
fondly round his neck and he tried to 

fancy but the attempt was vain - 

the luxury of a kiss from her red ripe 
lips 

you may think me uxorious 
luke he resumed in his deep 
manly voice but i do think that 
god never made a nobler woman than 



 



the merchant s daughter 



my dora look at the sacrifice she 
made for my sake young bloom 
ing and but twenty summers old she 
forgot the disparity of my years and 
consented to share my bachelor s- 
home 

 she is a noble woman ob 
served luke and then he looked at 
the moon and whistled an air from 
the very select operatic spectacle of 
bone squash 

noble in heart and soul ex 
claimed livingstone confess luke 
that we married men live more in an 
hour than you dull bachelors in a 
year 

 oh yes certainly you may 
well talk when you have such a hand 
some wife egad if i was nt afraid 
it would make you jealous i would 
say that mrs livingstone has the 
most splendid form i ever beheld 

there was a slight contortion of mr 
harvey s upper lip as he spoke which 
looked very much like a sneer 

and then her heart luke her 
heart so noble so good so affec 
tionate i wish you could have seen 
her where first i beheld her in a 
small and meanly furnished apart 
ment at the bed-side of a dying 
mother they were in reduced cir 
cumstances for her father had died 
insolvent he had been my father s 
friend and i thought it my duty to 
visit the widowed mother and the 
orphan daughter by-the-bye luke 
i now remember that i saw you at 
their house in wood street once 
did you know the family 

 miss dora s father had been kind 
to me said luke in a quiet tone 
there was a strange light in his dark 



eye as he spoke and a lemarkable 
tremor on his lip 

well well luke here s my 
house exclaimed mr livingstone 
as they arrived in front of a lofly four 
storied mansion situated in the aristo 
cratic square as it is called along 
south fourth street it is lucky 
have my dead-latch key i can enter 
without disturbing the servants come 
up stairs into the front parlor with 
me luke i want to have a few more 
words with you about the forgery 

they entered the door of the man 
sion passed along a wide and roomy 
entry ascended a richly carpeted 
staircase and traversing the entry in 
the second story in a moment stood 
in the centre of the spacious parlor 
fronting the street on the second floor 
in another moment mr livingstone 
by the aid of some lucifer matches 
which he found on the mantle lighted 
a small bed-lamp standing amid the 
glittering volumes that were piled on 
the centre table the dim light of the 
lamp flickering around the room re 
vealed the various characteristics of 
an apartment furnished in a style of 
lavish magnificence above the man 
tle flashed an enormous mirror on 
one side of the parlor was an inviting 
sofa on the other a piano two splen 
did ottomans stood in front of the fire- 
ess hearth and curtains of splendid 
silk hung drooping heavily along the 
hree lofly windows that looked into 
the street in fine the parlor was all 
that the upholsterer and cabinet 
maker combined could make it a de- 
dository of luxurious appointments and 
costly furniture 

 draw your seat near the centre 



dora livingstone 



table luke cried mr livingstone i sented his letter of credit it was cash- 
as he flung himself into a comfortable ted and we wrote to grayson bal- 



rocking chair and gazed around the 
room with an expression of quiet satis 
faction don t speak too loud luke 
for dora is sleeping in the next room 
you know i want to take her by a 
little surprise eh luke she 
doesn t expect me from new york 
for a week yet i am the last person 
in the world she thinks to see to-night 
clearly so ha ha 

and the merchant chuckled gaily 
rubbed his hands together glanced at 
the folding doors that opened into the 
bed-chamber where slept his bloom 
ing wife and then turning round look 
ed in the face of luke harvey with a 
smile that seemed to say i can t 
help it if you bachelors are misera 
ble pity you but can t help it 

 it would be a pity to awaken mrs 
livingstone said luke fixing his 
brilliant dark eye on the face of the 
senior partner with a look so meaning 
and yet mysterious that mr living 
stone involuntarily averted his gaze 
a very great pity by the bye 
with regard to the forgery 

let me recapitulate the facts 
some weeks ago we received a letter 
from the respectable house of grayson 
ballenger co charleston stating 
that they had made a large purchase 
in cotton from a rich planter mr 
ellis mortimer who in a week or so 
would visit philadelphia with a letter 
of credit on our house for one hundred 
thousand dollars they gave us this 



lenger co announcing the fact 
 they returned the agreeable an 
swer that mr ellis mortimer had not 
yet left charleston for philadelphia 
but had altered his intention and wag 
about to sail for london that the 
gentleman in the white cravat and 
hump-back was an impostor and the 
letter of credit a forgery there 
was considerable mystery in the al- 
fair for instance how did the impos 
tor gain all the necessary information 
with regard to mr mortimer s visit 
how did he acquire a knowledge of the 
signature of the charleston house 

 listen and i will tell you last 
week in new york i received a let 
ter from the charleston house an 
nouncing these additional facts it 
appears that in the beginning of fall 
they received a letter from a mr al 
bert hazelton munroe representing 
himself as a rich planter in wain- 
bridge south carolina he had a 
large amount of cotton to sell and 
would like to procure advances on it 
from the charleston house they 
wrote him an answer to his letter ask 
ing the quality of the cotton and so 
forth and soliciting an interview with 
mr munroe when he visited charles 
ton in the beginning of november 
mr munroe a dark-complexioned 
man dressed like a careless country 
squire entered their store for the first 
time and commenced a series of ne 
gotiations about his cotton which 



intimation in order that we might be had resulted in nothing when another 



prepared to cash the letter of credit at 
eight well in a week a gentleman 
of respectable exterior appearedgt stated 
that he was mr ellis mortimer pre- 



planter mr ellis mortimer appeared 
in the scene sold his cotton and re 
quested the letter of credit on our 
house mr munroe was in the store 



the merchant s daughter 



every day was a jolly unpretend 
ing fellow familiar with all the 
clerks and on intimate terms with 
messrs grayson ballenger co 
the letter written to our house inti 
mating the intended visit of mr mor 
timer to this city had been very care 
lessly left open for a few moments on 
the counting house desk and mr 
munroe was observed glancing over 
its contents by one of the clerks the 
day after that letter had been despatch 
ed to philadelphia mr albert h 
munroe suddenly disappeared and 
had not been heard of since the 
charleston house suspect him of the 
whole forgery in all its details 

 very likely he saw the letter 
on the counter forged the letter of 
credit and despatched his accom 
plice to philadelphia without delay 
 now for the consequences of this 
forgery on monday morning next 
we have an engagement of one hun 
dred thousand dollars to meet which 
under present circumstances may 
plunge our house into the vortex of 
bankruptcy unless this impostor is 
 discovered unless his connection with 
this munroe is clearly ascertained be 
fore next monday i must look for 
ward to that day as one of the greatest 
danger to our house you see our po 
sition luke 

yes yes answered luke as 
he arose and advancing gazed fixed 
ly into the face of mr livingstone 
 i see our position and i see your 
position in more respects than one 

 confound the thing man how 
you stare in my face do you see 
anything peculiar about my counte 
nance that you peruse it so attentive 
ly 



 ha - - ha cried luke with a 
hysterical laugh ha ha no 
thing but horns horns sir i 
say horns a fine branching pair 
ha ha way damn it living 
stone you won t tf able to enter the 
church door next sunday without 
stooping those horns are so d d 
large 

livingstone looked at him with a 
face of blank wonder he evidently 
supposed that luke had been seized 
with sudden madness to see a man 
who is your familiar friend and part 
ner abruptly break off a conversation 
on matters of the most importance 
and stare vacantly in your face as he 
compliments you on some fancied re 
semblance which you bear to a full- 
grown stag is it must be confessed 
a spectacle somewhat unfrequent in 
this world of ours and rather adapted 
to excite a feeling of astonishment 
whenever it happens 

mr harvey are you mad 
asked livingstone in a calm deliberate 
tone 

harvey slowly leaned forward and 
brought his face so near livingstone s 
that the latter could feel his breath on 
his cheek he applied his mouth to 
the ear of the senior partner and 
whispered a single word 

when a soldier in battle receives 
a bullet directly in the heart he springs 
in the air with one convulsive spasm 
flings his arms aloft and utters a 
groan that thrills the man who hears 
it with a horroi never to be forgotten 
with that same convulsive movement 
with that same deep groan of horror 
and anguish livingstone the mer 
chant sprang to his feet and confront 
ed the utterer of that single word 



dora livingstone 



 harvey he said in a low tone 
mj with white and trembling lips 
while his calm blue eye flashed with 
that deep glance of excitement most 
terrible when visible in a calm blue 
eye harvey you had better never 
been born than utter that word again 
to trifle with a thing of this kind is 
worse than death harvey i advise 
you to leave me i am losing all 
command of myself there is a voice 
within me tempting me to murder you 
for god s sake quit my sight 

harvey looked in his face fearless 
and undaunted though his snake-like 
eye blazed like a coal of fire and his 
thin lips quivered as with the death 
bpasm 

 cuckold he shrieked in a hiss- 
 ing voice with a wild hysterical laugh 

livingstone started back aghast 
the purple veins stood out like cords 
on his bronzed forehead and his right 
hand trembled like a leaf as it was 
thrust within the breast of his coat 
his blue eye great god how glassy 
it had grown was fixed upon the 
form of luke harvey as if meditating 
where to strike 

to the bedchamber shrieked 
luke if she is there i am a liar 
and a dog and deserve to die cuck 
old i say and will prove it to the 
bedchamber 

and to the bedchamber with an even 
stride though his massive form quiver 
ed like an oak shaken by the hurri 
cane strode the merchant the fold 
ing door slid back he had disap 
peared into the bedchamber 

there was silence for a single in 
stant like the silence m the graveyard 
between the last word of the prayer 



and the first rattling sound of the clods 
upon the coffin 

in a moment livingstone again 
strode into the parlor his face was 
the hue of ashes you could see that 
the struggle at work within his heart 
was like the agony of the strong man 
wrestling with death this struggle 
was tenfold more terrible than death- 
death in its vilest form it forced the 
big beaded drops of sweat out from 
the corded veins on his brow it drove 
the blood from his face leaving a 
black and discolored streak beneath 
each eye 

 she is not there he said 
taking luke by the hand which he 
wrung with an iron grasp and mur 
mured again she is not there 

false to her husband s bed and 
honor exclaimed luke the agita 
tion which had convulsed his face 
subsiding into a look of heart-wrung 
compassion as he looked upon the 
terrible results of his disclosure 
 false as hell and vile as false 

an object on the centre table half 
concealed by the bed-lamp arrested 
the husband s attention he thrust 
aside the lamp and beheld a note ad 
dressed to himself in mrs living 
stone s hand 

with a trembling hand the merchant 
tore the note open and while luke 
stood fixedly regarding him perused 
its contents 

and as he read the blood came 
back to his cheeks the glance to his 
eyes and his brow reddened over with 
one burning flush of indignation 

 liar and dog he shouted in 
tones hoarse with rage as he grasped 
luke harv jr by the throat with 



 



the merchant s daughter 



sudden movement your lie was 
well coined but look here ha ha 
 and he shook luke to and fro like 
a broken reed here is my wife s 
letter here sir look at it and i ll 
fbrce you to eat your own foul words 
here expecting that i might suddenly 
return from new york my wife has 
written down that she would be absent 
from home to-night a sick friend 
a school-day companion now reduced 
to widowhood and penury solicited 
her company by her dying bed and 
my wife could not refuse read sir 
oh read 

 take your hand from my throat 
or i ll do you a mischief mur 
mured luke in a choaking voice as 
he grew black in the face i will 
by god 

read sir oh read shouted 
livingstone as he forced luke into a 
chair and thrust the letter into his 
hands read sir and then crawl 
from this room like a vile dog as you 
are to-morrow i will settle with 
you 

luke sank in the chair took the 
letter and with a pale face varied by 
a crimson spot on each cheek he be 
gan to read while livingstone tower 
ing and erect stood regarding him 
with a look of incarnate scorn 

it was observable that while luke 
perused the letter his head dropped 
slowly down as though in the endea 
vor to see more clearly and his un 
occupied hand was suddenly thrust 
within the breast of his overcoat 

 that is a very good letter well 
written and she minds her stops 
exclaimed luke calmly as he handed 
the letter back to mr livingstone 
quite an effort of composition i 



didn t think dora had so multh 
tact 

the merchant was thunderstruck 
with the composure exhibited by tho 
slanderer and the liar he glanced 
over luke s features with a quick 
nervous glance and then looked at 
the letter which he held in his hand 

 ha this is not the same letter 
he shouted in tones of mingled rage 
and wonder this letter is address 
ed to col fitz-cowles 

it was dropped in the counting 
house by the colonel this evening 
said luke with the air of a man who 
was prepared for any hazard the 
colonel is a very fine man a favorite 
with the fair sex read it oh 
read 

with a look of wonder mr living 
stone opened the letter there was a 
quivering start hi his whole frame 
when he first observed the hand-writ- 
ing 

but as he went on drinking in word 
after word his countenance so full of 
meaning and expression was like a 
mirror in which different faces are 
seen one after another by sudden 
transition at first his face grew crim 
son then it was pale as death in an 
instant then his lips dropped apart 
and his eyes were covered with a 
glassy film then a deep wrinkle 
shot upward between his brows and 
then black and ghastly the circles of 
discolored flesh were visible beneath 
each eye the quivering nostrils 
the trembling hands the heaving 
chest die man ever die with a strug 
gle terrible as this 

he sank heavily into a chair and 
crushing the letter between his fingers 
buried his fice in his hands 



dora livingstone 



oh my god he groaned 
 oh my god and i loved her so 

and then between the very fingers 
convulsively clutching the fatal letter 
there fell large and scalding tears 
drop by drop pouring heavily like 
the first tokens of a coming thunder 
bolt on a summer day 

luke harvey arose and strode hur- 
xiedly along the floor the sight was 
too much for him to bear and yet 
as he turned away he heard the groans 
of the strong man in his agony and 
the heart- wrung words came like 
the voice of the dying to his ear 

 oh my god oh my god and i 
loved her so 

when luke again turned and gazed 
upon the betrayed husband he beheld 
a sight that filled him with unutterable 
horror 

there as he sat his face buried in 
x his hands his head bowed on his 
breast his brow was partly exposed 
to the glare of the lamp-beams and 
all around that brow amid the locks 
of his dark brown hair were streaks 
of hoary white the hair of the mer 
chant had withered at the root the 
blow was so sudden so blighting and 
so terrible that even his strong mind 
reeled his brain tottered and in the 
effort to command his reason his hair 
grew white with agony 

would to god i had not told 
him murmured luke i knew 
rot that he loved her so i knew not 
and yet ha ha loved her 
once 

 luke my friend said liv 
ingstone in a tremulous voice as he 



 this is a fact established by the evidence 
of a medical gentlerrian of the first reputation 



raised his face know you anything 
of the place named in the let 
ter 

 i do and will lead you there 
answered luke his face resuming its 
original expression of agitation 
 come he cried in a husky voice 
as olden-time memories seemed striv 
ing at his heart come 

 can you gain me access to the 
house to the the room 

 did i not track them thither last 
night come 

the merchant slowly rose and took 
a pair of pistols from his carpet bag 
they were small and convenient 
travelling pistols mounted hi silver 
with those noiseless patent triggers 
that emit no clicking sound by way 
of warning he inspected the percus 
sion caps and sounded each pistol 
barrel 

silent and sure muttered 
luke they are each loaded with 
a single ball 

which way do you lead to 
the southern part of the city 

 to southwark answered 
luke leading the way from the par- 
or to the rookery to the den to 
he pest-house 

in a moment they stood upon the 
door step of the merchant s princely 
mansion the vivid light of the decem 
ber moon imparting a ghastly hue to 
livingstone s face with the glassy 
eyes rendered more fearful by the dis 
colored circles of flesh beneath tho 
furrowed brow and the white lips all 
fixed in an expression stern and reso- 
ute as death 

luke flung his hand to the south 
and his dark impenetrable eyes shone 
with meaning the merchant placed 



the merchant s daughter 



his partner s arm within his own and 
they hurried down fourth street with 
a single word from luke 
 to monk-hall 



chapter sixth 

monk-hall 

stbange traditions have come 
down to our time in relation to a 
massive edifice which long before 
the revolution stood in the centre of 
an extensive garden surrounded by a 
brick wall and encircled by a deep 
grove of horse-chesnut and beechen 
trees this edifice was located on the 
out-skirts of the southern part of the 
city and the garden overspread some 
acres occupying a space full as large 
as a modern square 

this mansion but rarely seen by 
intrusive eyes had been originally 
erected by a wealthy foreigner some 
time previous to the revolution who 
this foreigner was his name or his 
history has not been recorded by tra 
dition but his mansion in its general 
construction and details indicated a 
mind rendered whimsical and capri 
cious by excessive wealth 

the front of the mansion cne plain 
mass of black and red brick disposed 
like the alternate colors of n chess 
board looked towards the south a 
massive hall-door defended by heavy 
pillars and surmounted by an intricate 
cornice all carved and sculptured into 
hideous satyr-faces three ranges of 



 no reader who wishes to understand this 
itory in all ts details will fail to peruse this 
tkapte 



deep square windows with cumbrous 
sash frames and small panes of glass 
a deep and sloping roof elaborate 
with ornaments of painted wood along 
the eaves and rising into a gabled 
peak directly over the hall-door while 
jits outlines were varied by rows of 
substantial chimneys fashioned into 
strange and uncouth shapes all 
combined produced a general impres 
sion of ease and grandeur that was 
highly effective in awing the spirits of 
any of the simple citizens who might 
obtain a casual glance of the house 
through the long avenue of trees ex 
tending from the garden gate 

this impression of awe was some 
what deepened by various rumors that 
obtained through the southern part of 
the quaker city it was said that 
the wealthy proprietor not satisfied 
with building a fine house with three 
stories above ground had also con 
structed three stories of spacious 
chambers below the level of the 
earth this was calculated to stir 
the curiosity and perhaps the scandal 
of the town and as a matter of course 
strange rumors began to prevail about 
midnight orgies held by the godless 
proprietor in his subterranean apart 
ments where wine was drunken with 
out stint and beauty ruined without 
remorse veiled figures had beer 
seen passing through the garden gate 
after night and men were not wanting 
to swear that these figures in dark 
robes and sweeping veils were pretty 
damsels with neat ankles and soft 
eyes 

as time passed on the rumors 
grew and the mystery deepened 
the neatly-constructed stable at the 
end of the garden was said to be con 



monk-hall 



 



nee ted with the house some hundred 
yards distant by a subterranean pas 
sage the two wings branching out 
at either extremity of the rear of the 
mansion looked down upon a court 
yard separated by a light wicket 
fence from the garden walks the 
court-yard overarched by an awning 
in summer time was said to be the 
scene of splendid festivals to which 
the grandees of the city were invited 
from the western wing of the man 
sion arose a square lanthern-like 
structure which the gossips called a 
tower and hinted sagely of witchcraft 
and devildom whenever it was named 
they called the proprietor a libertine 
a gourmand an astrologer and a 
wizard he feasted in the day and he 
consulted his friend the devil at 
night he drank wine at all times 
and betrayed innocence on every oc 
casion in short the seclusion of the 
mansion its singular structure its 
wall of brick and its grove of impene 
trable trees gave rise to all sorts of 
stories and the proprietor has come 
down to our time with a decidedly bad 
character although it is more than 
likely that he was nothing but a 
wealthy englishman whimsical and 
eccentric the boon-companion and 
friend of governor evans the rollick 
ing chief magistrate of the province 

although tradition has not preserved 
the name of the mysterious individual 
yet the title of his singular mansion 
is still on record 

it was called monk-hall 

there are conflicting traditions 
which assert that this title owed its 
origin to other sources a catholic 
priest occupied the mansion after the 
original proprietoi went home to his 



native land or slid into his grave it 
was occupied as a nunnery as a 
monastary or as a resort for the sisters 
of charity the mass had been said 
within its walls its subterranean 
chambers converted into cells its 
tower transformed into an oratory cf 
prayer such are the dim legends 
which were rife some forty years ago 
concerning monk-hall long after the 
city in its southern march had cut 
down the trees overturned the wall 
levelled the garden into building lots 
and divided it by streets and alleys 
into a dozen triangles and squares 

some of these legends so vague 
and so conflicting are still preserved 
in the memories of aged men and 
white-haired matrons who will sit by 
the hour and describe the gradual 
change which time and improvement 
those twin desolators of the beautiful 
had accomplished with monk-hall 

soon after the revolution fine brick 
buildings began to spring up along the 
streets which surrounded the garden 
while the alleys traversing its area 
grew lively with long lines of frame 
houses variously fashioned and paint 
ed whose denizens awoke the echoes 
of the place with the sound of the 
hammer and the grating of the saw 
time passed on and the distinctive 
features of the old mansion and garden 
were utterly changed could the old 
proprietor have risen from his grave 
and desired to pay another visit to his 
friend the devil in the subterranean 
chambers of his former home he 
would have had to say the least of it a 
devil of a time in finding the way 
where the old brick wall had stood 
he would have found long rows of 
dwelling houses some four storied 



 



the merchant s daughter 















some three or one some brick 
some frame a few pebble-dashed and 
all alive with inhabitants 

in his attempt to find the hall he 
would have had to wind up a narrow 
alley turn down a court strike up an 
avenue which it would take some 
knowledge of municipal geography to 
navigate at last emerging into a nar 
row street where four alleys crossed 
he would behold his magnificent man 
sion of monk-hall with a printing 
office on one side and a stereotype 
foundry on the other while on the 
opposite side of the way a mass of 
 miserable frame houses seemed about 
to commit suicide and fling themselves 
madly into the gutter and in the dis 
tance a long line of dwellings offices 
and factories looming in broken per 
spective looked as if they wanted to 
shake hands across the narrow street 
the southern front of the house alas 
how changed alone is visible the 
shutters on one side of the hall-door are 
nailed up and hermetically closed 
while on the other shutters within the 
glasses bar out the light of day the 
semi-circular window in the centre 
of the gabled-peak has been built up 
with brick yet our good friend would 
find the tower on the western wing in 
tolerable good preservation the sta 
ble one hundred yards distant from 
monk-hall what has become of it 
perhaps it is pulled down or it may 
be that a splendid dwelling towers in 
its place it is still in existence 
standing amid the edifices of a busy 
street its walls old and tottering its 
ancient stable-floor turned into a bulk 
window surmounted by the golden 
balls of a pawnbroker while within its 
precincts rooms furnished for house- 






hold use supply the place of the stalls 
of the olden-time does the subter 
ranean passage still exist future 
pages of our story may possibly an 
swer the question 

could our ancient and ghostly pro 
prietor glide into the tenements ad 
joining monk-hall and askthe me 
chanic or his wife the printer or the 
factory marj to tell him the story of 
the strange old building he would find 
that the most remarkable ignorance 
prevailed in regard to the structure 
its origin and history one man 
might tell him that it had been a fac 
tory or a convent or the lord knows 
what another might intimate that it 
had been a church a third and he 
belonged to the most numerous class 
would reply in a surly tone that he 
knew nothing about the old brick nui 
sance while in the breasts of one or 
two aged men and matrons yet living 
in southwark would be discovered the 
only chronicles of the ancient struc 
ture now extant the only records of 
its history or name did our spirit- 
friend glide over the threshold and 
enter the chambers of his home his 
eye would perhaps behold scenes that 
rivalled in vice and magnificence 
anything that legend chronicled of the 
olden-time of monk-hall although its 
exterior was so desolate and its out- 
side-door of green blinds varied by a 
big brass plate bore the respectable 
and saintly name of abijah k 
jones in immense letters half in 
distinct with dirt and rust 

who this abijah k jones was no 
one knew although the owner of the 
house a good christian who had a 



pew in 



church where he took 



the sacrament at least once a month 



the monks of monk-hall 



might have been able to tell with very 
little research yet what of that 
abijah k jones might have nightly 
entertained the infernal regions in his 
house and not a word been said about 
it because as the pious landlord 
would observe when cramming abi- 
jahs rent-money into the same pocket- 
book that contained some tract-society 
receipts t good tenant that pays 
his rent with the regularity of clock

chapter seventh 

the monks op monk-hall 

the moon was shining brightly 
over the face of the old mansion while 
the opposite side of the alley lay in 
dim and heavy shadow the light 
brown hue of the closed shutters af 
forded a vivid contrast to the surface 
of the front which had the strikingly 
gloomy effect always produced by the 
intermixture of black and red brick 
disposed like the colors of a chess 
board in the structure of a mansion 
the massive cornice above the hall- 
door the heavy eaves of the roof the 
gabled peak rising in the centre and 
the cumbrous frames of the many 
windows all stood out boldly in 
the moonlight from the dismal relief 
of the building s front 

the numerous chimneys with their 
fantastic shapes rose grimly in the 
moonlight like a strange band of gob 
lin sentinels perched of the roof to 
watch the mansion the general ef 
fect was that of an ancient structure 
falling to decay deserted by all inhab 
itants save the rats that gnawed the 



wainscot along the thick old walla 
the door-plate that glittered on the 
faded door half covered as it was with 
rust and verdigris with its saintly name 
afforded the only signs of the actual 
occupation of monk-hall by human 
beings in all other respects it looked 
so desolate so time-worn so like a 
mausoleum for old furniture and 
crumbling tapestry for high-backed 
mahogany chairs gigantic bedsteads 
and strange looking mirrors veiled in 
the thick folds of the spider s web 

dim and indistinct like the booming 
of a distant cannon the sound of the 
state-house bell thrilled along tho 
intricate maze of streets and alleys 
it struck the hour of two the mur 
mur of the last stroke of the bell so 
dim and indistinct was mingled with 
the echo of approaching footsteps and 
in a moment two figures turned the 
corner of an alley that wound among 
the tangled labyrinth of avenues and 
came hastening on toward the lonely 
mansion lonely even amid tenements 
and houses gathered as thickly to 
gether as the cells in a bee-hive 

 i say gus what a devil of a way 
you ve led me cried one of the 
strangers with a thick cloak wrapped 
round his limbs up one alley and 
down another around one street and 
through another backwards and for 
wards round this way and round that 
damme if i can tell which is north 
or south except by the moon 

 hist my fellow don t mention 
names cardinal doctrine that on an 
affair of this kind answered the 
tall figure whose towering form was 
enveloped in a frogged overcoat 
 remember you pass in as my friend 



the merchant s daughter 



wait a moment we ll see whether 
old devil-bug is awake 

ascending the granite steps of the 
mansion he gave three distinct raps 
with his gold-headed cane on the sur 
face of the brass -plate in a moment 
the rattling of a heavy chain and the 
sound of a bolt slowly withdrawn 
was heard within and the door of the 
mansion beyond the outside door of 
green blinds receded about the width 
of an inch 

 who s there a disturbin honest 
folks this hour o the night said a 
voice that came grumbling through 
the blinds of the green door like the 
sound of a grindstone that hasn t been 
oiled for some years what the devil 
you want go about your business 
or i ll call the watch 

 i say devil -bug what hour o th 
aight is it exclaimed lorrimer in a 
whispered tone 

 dinner time replied the 
grindstone voice slightly oiled 
come in sir did nt know twas 
you how the devil should come 
in 

as the voice grunted this invitation 
lorrimer seized byrnewood by the 
arm and glided through the opened 
door 

byrnewood looked around in wonder 
as he discovered that the front door 
opened into a small closet or room 
some ten feet square the floor bare 
and uncarpeted the ceiling darkened 
by smoke while a large coal fire 
burning in a rusty grate afforded 
both light and heat to the apartment 

the heat was close and stifling 
while the light but dim and flickering 
iislosed the form of the door-keeper 
of monk-hall as he stood directly in 



ront of the grate surrounded by lh 
details of his den 

this is my friend said lot- 
rimer in a meaning tone you un 
derstand devil-bug 

yes grunted the grindstone 
voice i understand o course but 
my name is bijah k jones if you 
slease my pertikler friend i never 
know d sich a individooal as devii- 
bug 

it requires no great stretch of fancy 
o imagine that his satanic majesty 
once on a time in a merry mood 
created a huge insect in order to test 
lis inventive powers certainly that 
nsect which it was quite natural to 
designate by the name of devil-bug 
stood in the full light of the grate 
gazing steadfastly in byrne wood s 
face it was a strange thickset speci 
men of flesh and blood with a short 
body marked by immensely broad 
shoulders long arms and thin destort- 
ed legs the head of the creature 
was ludicrously large in proportion to 
the body long masses of stiff black 
hair fell tangled and matted over a 
forehead protuberent to deformity a 
flat nose with wide nostrils shooting 
out into each cheek like the smaller 
wings of an insect an immense mouth 
whose heavy lips disclosed two long 
rows of bristling teeth a pointed chin 
blackened by a heavy beard and mas 
sive eyebrows meeting over the nose 
all furnished the details of a counte 
nance not exactly calculated to in 
spire the most pleasant feelings in the 
world one eye small black and 
shapen like a bead stared steadily in 
byrnewood s face while the other 
socket was empty shrivelled and orb- 
less the eyelids of the vacant socket 



the monks of monk-hall 



were joined together like the opposing j buried all traces of a chin and discjos- 
edges of a curtain while the other eye jed two rows of teeth protruding like 
gained additional brilliancy and effect the tusks of a wild boar musquito 



from the loss of its fellow member 

the shoulders of the devil-bug 
protruding in unsightly knobs the 
wide chest and the long arms with 
talon-like fingers so vividly contrast 
ed with the thin and distorted legs all 
attested that the remarkable strength 
of the man was located in the upper 
 part of his body 

 well abijah are you satisfied 
asked lorrimer as he perceived 
byrnewood shrink back with disgust 
from the door-keeper s gaze this 
gentleman i say is my friend v 

so i s pose grunted abijah 
 here musquito mark this man 
here glow-worm mark him i say 
this is monk gusty s friend can t 
you move quicker you ugly devils 

from either side of the fire-place 
as he spoke emerged a tall herculean 
negro with a form of strength and 
sinews of iron moving slowly along 
the floor from the darkness which 
had enshrouded their massive outlines 
they stood silent and motionless gaz 
ing with look of stolid indifference 



upon 



the face of the new-comer 



byrnewood had started aside in disgust 
from the devil-bug as he was styled 
in the slang of monk-hall but certainly 
these additional insects nestling in the 
ky den of the other were rather singular 
specimens of the glow-worm and mus- 
quito their attire was plain and 
simple each negro was dressed in 
coarse corduroy trowsers and a flar 
ing red flannel shirt the face of 
 glow-worm was marked by a hideous 
flat nose a receding forehead and a 
wide mouth with immense lips that 



had the same flat nose the same re 
ceding forehead but his thick lips 
tightly compressed were drawn down 
on either side towards his jaw present 
ing an outline something like the two 
sides of a triangle while his sharp 
and pointed chin was in direct contrast 
to the long chinless jaw of the other 
their eyes large rolling and vacant 
stared from bulging eyelids that pro 
truded beyond the outline of the brows 
altogether each negro presented as 
hideous a picture of mere brute 
strength linked with a form scarcely 
human as the imaginatior of man 
might well conceivej 

 this is monk gusty s friend 
muttered abijah or devil -bug as tho 
reader likes mark him musquito 
mark him glow-worm i say 
mind ye now this man don t leave 
the house except with gusty d ye 
hear ye black devils 

each negro growled assent 

 queer specimens of a musquito 
and a glow-worm i say laughed 
byrnewood in the effort to smother his 
disgust eh lorrimer 

 this way my fellow answer 
ed the magnificent gus gently leading 
his friend through a small door which 
led from the doorkeeper s closet 
 this way now for the club and 
then for the wager p 

looking around in wonder byrne- 
wood discovered that they had passed 
into the hall of an old-time mansion 
with the beams of the moon falling 
from a skylight in the roof far above 
down over the windings of a massive 
staircase 



the merchant s daughter 



 this is rather a strange place 
eh gus whispered byrnewood as 
he gazed around the hall and marked 
the ancient look of the place why 
the d don t they have a light 
those insects ha-ha whom we have 
just left 

 secrecy my fellow secrecy 
those are the police of monk-hall 
certain to be at hand in case of a row 
you see the entire arrangements of 
this place may be explained in one 
word it is easy enough for a stranger 



ranean stairway surrounded by the 
darkness of midnight byrnewood 
found it difficult to subdue a feeling of 
awe which began to spread like a 
shadow over his soul this feeling it 
was not easy to analyze it may 
have been a combination of feelings 
the consideration of the darkness and 
loneliness of the place his almost 
entire ignorance of the handsome liber 
tine who was now leading him he 
knew not where or perhaps the 
earnest words of the astrologer fraught 



that s you my boy to find his with doom and death came home to 



way in but it would puzzle him like 
the devil to find his way out that 
is without assistance take my arm 
byrnewood we must descend to the 
club room 

 descend 

 yes my fellow descend for we 
hold our meetings one sory under 
ground its likely all the fellows 
or monks to speak in the slang of the 
club are now most royally drunk 
so i can slide you in among them 
without much notice you can re 
main there while i go and prepare the 
bride ha ha ha the bride for 
your visit 

meanwhile grasping byrnewood by 
the arm he had led the way along the 
hall beyond the staircase into the 
thick darkness which rested upon this 
part of the place unillumined by a ray 
of light 

 hold my arm as tight as you 
can he whispered there is a 
staircase somewhere here softly 
softly now i have it tread with 
care byrnewood in a moment we 
will be in the midst of the monks of 
monk-hall 

and as they descended the subte- 



his soul like a vivid presentiment in 
that moment of uncertainty and gloom 

 don t you hear their shouts my 
boy whispered lorrimer faith 
they must be drunk as judges every 
man of them why byrnewood 
you re as still as death 

 to tell you the truth lorrimer 
this place looks like the den of some 
old wizard it s so d d gloomy 

 here we are at the door now 
mark me byrnewood you must 
walk in the club-room or monk s room 
as they call it directly at my back 
while i salute the monks of monk- 
hall you will slide into a vacant seat 
at the table and mingle in the revelry 
of the place until i return 

stooping through a narrow door 
whose receding panels flung a blaze 
of light along the darkness of the pas 
sage lorrimer with byrnewood at 
his back descended three wooden 
steps that led from the door-sill to the 
floor and in a moment stood amid 
the revellers of monk-hall 

in a long narrow room lighted by 
the blaze of a large chandelier with a 
low ceiling and a wide floor covered 
with a double-range of carpets around 



the monks of monk-hall 



 



a table spread with the relics of their 
feast were grouped the monks of 
monk-halu 

they hailed lorrimer with a shout 
and as they rore to greet him byrne- 
wood glided into a vacant arm-chair 
near the head of the table and in a 
moment his companion had disappear 
ed 

i ll be with you in a moment 
monks of monk-hall he shouted 
as he glided through the narrow door 
a little affair to settle up stairs 
you know me nice little girl ha- 
ha-ha 

 ha-ha-ha echoed the band of 
revellers raising their glasses merrily 
on high 

byrnewood glanced hurriedly 
around the room long and spa 
cious as it was the floor covered with 
the most gorgeous carpeting and the 
low ceiling embellished with a faded 
painting in fresco still wore an anti 
quated not to say dark and gloomy 
appearance the wnll rfi rnnitf - 
ejihugenejsjd-wunaa in 
tricate with uncouth sculpturings of 
fawns and satyrs and other hideous 
creations of classic mythology at 
one end of the room reaching from 
floor to ceiling glared an immense 
mirror framed in massive walnut its 
glittering surface reflecting the long 
festal board with its encircling band 
of revellers inserted in the corres 
ponding panels of the wainscot on 
either side of the small door at the 
opposite end of the room two large 
pictures evidently the work of a 
master hand indicated the mingled 
worship of the devotees of monk-hall 
in the picture on the right of the door 
bacchus the jolly god of mirth and 

 



wine was represented rising from a 
festal -board his brow wreathed in 
clustering grapes while his hand 
swung aloft a goblet filled with the 
purple blood of the grape in the 
other painting along a couch as dark 
as night with a softened radiance 
falling over her uncovered form lay a 
sleeping venus her full arms twining 
above her head while her lips were 
dropped apart as though she murmur 
ed in her slumber straight and erect 
behind the chair of the president or 
abbot of the board arose the effigy of 
a monk whose long black robes fell 
drooping to the floor while his cowl 
hung heavily over his brow and his 
right hand raised on high a goblet of 
gold from beneath the shadow of 
the falling cowl glared a fleshless 
skeleton head with the orbless eye- 
sockets the cavity of the nose and 
the long rows of grinning teeth turned 
to a faint and ghastly crimson by the 
lampbeams the hand that held the 
goblet on high was a grisly skeleton 
hand the long and thin fingers of 
bone twining firmly around the glit 
tering bowl 

and over this scene over the paint 
ings and the mirror over the gloomy 
wainscot along the walls and over the 
faces of the revellers with the skeleton 
monk grinning derision at their scene 
of bestial enjoyment shone the red 
beams of the massive chandelier the 
body and limbs of which were fashioned 
into the form of a grim satyr with a 
light flaring from his skull a flame 
emerging from each eye while his ex- 
tended hands flung streams of fire on 
either side and his knees were huddled 
up against his breast the design wa 
like a nightmare dream so grotesque

strange and ghostly appearance of the 
room 

aound the long and narrow board 
btrown with the relics of the feast 
which had evidently been some hours 
in progress sate the monks of monk- 
hall some thirty hi number flinging 
their glasses on high while the room 
echoed with their oaths and drunken 
shouts some lay with their heads 
thrown helplessly on the table others 
were gazing round in sleepy drunken 
ness others had fallen to the floor in 
a state of unconscious intoxication 
while a few there were who still kept 
up the spirit of the feast although 
their incoherent words and heavy eyes 
proclaimed that they too were fast ad 
vancing to that state of brutal inebriety 
when strange-looking stars shine in 
the place of the lamps when the bot 
tles dance and even tables perform the 
cracovienne while all sorts of bee 
hives create a buzzing murmur in the 
air

grossly insulted muttered the edi 
tor as the poet s blow took effect on 
his wig and sent it spinning to the 
other end of the table is the daily 
black mail come to this t 

here he made a lunge at the author 
of the ten commandments a series 
of oiinets and joined in a fond em 
brace they fell insensible to the floor 

 take that wig out of my plate 
shouted a deep voice from the head of 
the table wigs as a general thing 
are not very nice with oysters but 
that fellow s wig ugh faugh 

attracted by the sound of the voice 
byrnewood glanced towards the head 
of the table there straight and erect 
sate the abbot of the night a gentle 
man elected by the fraternity to pre 
side over their feasts he was a man 
of some thirty odd years dressed in a 
suit of glossy black with a form re 
markable for its combination of 
strength with symmetry his face 
long and dusky lighted by the gleam 
of a dark eye indicating the man whose 
whole life had been one series of plot 
scheme and intrigue was relieved 
by heavy masses of long black hair 
resembling in its texture the mane of 
a horse which fell in curling locks 
to his shoulders it needed not a 
second glance to inform byrnewood 
that he beheld the hero of chesnut 
street the distinguished millionare 
col fitz-cowles the elegant cut 
of his dark vest which gathered over 
his prominent chest and around his 
slender waist with the nicety of a 
glove the plain black scarf fastened 
by a breast-pin of solid gold the 
glossy black of his dress-coat shapen 
of the best french cloth all disclosed 
the idol of the tailors the dream of 



the fashionable belles the envy of the 
dry gpods clerks algernon fitz- 
cowles he seemed by far the most 
sober man in the company every 
now and then byrnewood beheld him 
glance anxiously toward the door as 
though he wished to escape from the 
room and after every glance as he 
beheld one monk after another kissing 
the carpet bottle in hand the interest 
ing colonel would join heartily in the 
drunken bout raising his voice with 
the loudest and emptying his glass with 
the most drunken yet to the eye 
of byrnewood this looked more like 
a mere counterfeit of a drunkard s 
manner than the thing itself it was 
evident that the handsome millionaire 
emptied his glass under the table 

the revel now grew wild and 
furious as bottle after bottle was 
consumed so the actors in the scene 
began to appear more and more in 
their true characters at last all dis 
guise seemed thrown aside and each 
voice joining in the chorus of disjoint 
ed remarks indicated that its owner 
imagined himself amid the scenes of 
his daily life

here the literary gentleman fell 
heavily to the floor mingled in the 
same hean that contained the poet and 
the wigless editor in a moment he 
rose heavily to his feet and staggered 
slowly to mutchin s side

staggered from the room in company 
with the tow-haired gentleman 

 lord look down upon these thy 
children and continued the par 
son who like the others appeared 
unconscious of the retreat of petriken 
and his comrade

remarked a mercantile gentleman 
with a nose decorated by yellowish 
streaks from a mustard bottle

 what is this i see confusion and 
drunkeness is this a scene for the 
house of god he glanced around 
with a look of sober reproof and then 
suddenly exclaimed no heeltaps 
but show your bottoms ha-ha-ha 

there was another person who re 
garded this scene of bestial mirth with 
the same cool glance as byrnewood 
he was a young man with a massive 
face and a deep piercing brown eye 
his figure was somewhat stout his 
attire careless and his entire appear 
ance disclosed the young philadelphia 
lawyer changing his seat to byrne- 
wood s vicinity he entered into con 
versation with the young merchant 
and after making some pointed remarks 
in regard to the various members of 
the company he stated that he had 
been lured thither by mutchins who 
had fancied he might cheat him out of 
a snug sum at the roulette table or ths 
faro-bank in the course of the night

why my friend cried the 
young lawyer who gave his name as 
boyd merivale don t you know 
that this is one of the vilest rookeries 
f in the world if it unites in all its 
details the house-of-ill-fame the club- 
ii house and the gambling hellj egad 
i well remember the first time i set 
my foot within its doors what i 

beheld then i can never forget 

 you have been here before then 
 yes have i as i perceive you 
are unacquainted with the place i will 
tell you my experience of 

a night in monk -hall 

six years ago in on a foggy 
night in spring at the hour of one 
o clock i found myself reposing in 
one of the chambers of this mansion 
on an old-fashioned bed side by side 
with a girl who before her seduction 
had resided in my native village it 
was one o clock when i was aroused 
by a hushed sound like the noise of a 
distant struggle i awoke started up 
in bed and looked round the room 
was entirely without light save from 
the fire-place where a few pieces of 
half-burned wood emitted a dim and 
uncertain flame now it flashed up 
brightly giving a strange lustre to the 
old furniture of the room the high- 
backed mahogany chairs the anti 
quated bureau and the low ceiling 
with heavy cornices around the walls 
again the flame died away and all 
was darkness i listened intently i 



 the reader will remember that merivale 
entered monk-hall for no licentious object 
hit with the distinct purpose of discovering the 
ctreat of western this story told in mer- 
ivale s own words is strictly true 



could hear no sound save the breath 
ing of the girl who slept by my side 
and as i listened a sudden awe cama 
over me true i heard no noise but 
that my sleep had been broken by a 
most appaling sound i could not doubt 
and the stories i had heard of monk- 
hall came over me years before in 
my native village a wild rollicking 
fellow paul western cashier of the 
ounty bank had indulged my fancy 
with strange stories of a brothel situ 
ated in the outskirts of philadelphia 
paul was a wild fellow rather good 
looking and went often to the city on 
business he spoke of monk-hall as 
a place hard to find abounding in 
mysteries and darkened by hideous 
crimes committed within its walls it 
had three stories of chambers beneath 
the earth as well as above each of 
these chambers was supplied with trap- 
doors through the which the unsus 
pecting man might be flung by his 
murderer without a moment s warn 
ing there was but one range of 
rooms above the ground where these 
trap-doors existed from the garret 
to the first story all in the same line 
like the hatchways in a storehouse 
sank this range of trap-doors all care 
fully concealed by the manner in 
which the carpets were fixed a 
secret spring in the wall of any one of 
these chambers communicated with 
the spring hidden beneath the carpet 
the spring in the wall might be so 
arranged that a single footstep pressed 
on the spring under the carpet would 
open the trap-door and plunge the 
victim headlong through the aperture 
in such cases no man could stride 
across the floor without peril of hia 
life beneath the ground another 



the monks of monk-hall 



range of trap-cbors were placed in the 
same manner in the floors of three 
stories of the subterranean chambers 
they plunged the victim god knows 
where with such arrangements for 
murder above and beneath the earth 
might there not exist hideous pits or 
deep wells far below the third story 
under ground where the body of the 
victim would rot in darkness forever 
as i remembered these details the 
connection between paul western the 
cheerful bachelor and emily walra 
ven the woman who was sleeping at 
my side flashed over my mind the 

child of one of the first men of b 

educated without regard to expense by 
the doating fatherwith a mind singu 
larly masculine and a tall queenly formj 
a face distinguished for its beauty and a 
manner remarkable for its ladylike ele 
gance poor emily had been seduced 
some three years before and soon 
after disappeared from the town her 
seducer no one knew though from 
some hints dropped casually by my 
friend paul i judged that he at least 
could tell rumors came to the place 
from time to time in relation to the 
beautiful but fallen girl one rumor 
stated that she was now living as the 
mistress of a wealthy planter who 
made his residence at times in phila 
delphia another declared that she 
had become a common creature of the 
town and this great god how ter 
rible killed her poor father the 
rumor flew round the village to-day 
next sunday old walraven was dead 
and buried they say that in his dying 
hour he charged paul western with 
his daughter s shame and shrieked a 
father s curse upon his head he left 
no oroperty for his troubles had 



preyed on his mind until he neglected 
his affairs and he died insolvent 

well two years passed on and no 
one heard a word more of poor emily 
suddenly in the spring of when 
this town as well as the whole union 
was convulsed with the fever of spec 
ulation paul western after a visit to 
philadelphia with some funds of the 
bank amounting to near thirty thou 
sand dollars in his possession sud 
denly disappeared no one knew 
whither my father was largely in 
terested in the bank he despatched 
me to town in order that i might 
make a desperate effort to track up the 
footsteps of western some items in 
the papers stated that the cashier had 
fled to texas others that he had been 
drowned by accident others that he 
had been spirited away i alone pos 
sessed a clue to the place of his con 
cealment thus ran my thoughts at 
all events and that clue was locked 
in the bosom of emily walraven the 
betrayed and deeply-injured girl 
sometime before his disappearance 
and after the death of old walraven 
paul disclosed to me under a solemn 
pledge of secresy the fact that emily 
was living in philadelphia under his 
protection supported by his money 
he stated that he had furnished rooms 
at the brothel called monk-hall with 
this fact resting on my mind i had 
hurried to philadelphia for days my 
search for emily walraven was in 
vain one night when about giving up 
the chase as hopeless i strolled to the 
chesnut street theatre forrest was 
playing richelieu there was a row 
in the third tier a bully had offered 
violence to one of the ladies of the 
town attracted by the noise i join 



the merchant s daughter 



ed the throng rushing up stairs and 
beheld the girl who had been stricken 
standing pale and erect a small poig- 
nard in her upraised hand while her 
eyes flashed with rage as she dared 
the drunken buffer to strike her again 
i stood thunderstruck as i recognized 
emily walraven in the degraded yet 
beautiful woman who stood before me 
springing forward with one blow i 
felled the bully to the floor and in 
another moment seizing emily by the 
arm i hurried down stairs evaded the 
constables who were about to arrest 
her and gained the street it was yet 
early in the evening there were no 
cabs in the street so i had to walk 
home with her 

all this i remembered well as i sat 
listening in the lonely room 

i remembered the big tears that 
started from her eyes when she re 
cognized me her wild exclamations 
when i spoke of her course of life 
tf don t talk to me she had almost 
shrieked as we hurried along the 
street it s too late for me to 
change now for god s sake let me 
be happy in my degradation 

i remembered the warm flush of in 
dignation that reddened over her face 
as pointing carelessly to a figure 
which i observed through the fog 
some distance ahead i exclaimed 
is not that paul western yonder 
her voice was very deep and not at 
all natural in its tone as she replied 
with assumed unconcern i know 
nothing about the man at last 
after threading a labyrinth of streets 
compared to which the puzzling-gar 
den was a mere frolic we had gained 
monk-hall the place celebrated by the 
wonderful stories of my riend west 



ern egad as we neared the doot 
i could have sworn that beheld 
western himself disappear in the door 
but this doubtless i reasoned had 
been a mere fancy 

silence still prevailed in the room 
still i heard but the scund of emily 
breathing in her sleep and yet my 
mind grew more and more heavy 
with some unknown feeling of awe i 
remembered with painful distinctness 
the hang-dog aspect of the door-keeper 
who had let us in and the cut-throat 
visages of his two attendants seemed 
staring me visibly in the face i grew 
quite nervous dark ideas of murder 
and the devil knows what began to 
chill my very soul i bitterly remem 
bered that i had no arms the only 
thing i carried with me was a slight 
cane which had been lent me by the 

landlord of the hotel it was a 

mere switch of a thing 

as these things came stealing over 
me the strange connexion between the 
fate of western and that of the beau 
tiful woman who lay beside me the 
sudden disappearance of the former 
the mysterious character of monk-hall 
the startling sounds which had aroused 
me the lonely appearance of the room 
fitfully lighted by the glare on the 
hearth all combined deepened the 
impression of awe which had gradu 
ally gained possession of my faculties 
i feared to stir you may have felt 
this feeling this strange and incom 
prehensible feeling but if you have 
not just imagine a man seized with 
tlje night-mare when wide awake 

i was sitting upright in bed chilled 
to the very heart afraid to move an 
inch almost afraid to breathe when 
far far down through the chambers 



the monks of monk hall 



of the old mansion i heard a faint 
hushed sound like a man endeavour 
ing to cry out when attacked by night 
mare and then great god how dis 
tinct i heard the cry of murder 
murder murder far far far below 
me 

the cry aroused emily from her 
sleep she started up in the bed and 
whispered in a voice without tremor 
 what is the matter boyd 

 listen i cried with chattering 
teeth and again up from the depths 
of the mansion welled that awful 
sound murder murder mur 
der growing louder every time 
then far far far down i could hear 
a gurgling sound it grew fainter 
every moment fainter fainter faint 
er all was still as death 

 what does this mean i whisper 
ed almost fiercely turning to emily 
by my side what does this mean 
and a dark suspicion flashed over my 
mind 

the flame shot upward in the fire 
place and revealed every line of her 
intellectual countenance 

her dark eyes looked firmly in my 
face as she answered in god s 
name i know not 

the manner of the answer satisfied 
me as to her firmness if it did not 
convince me of her innocence i sat 
silent and sullen conjuring over the 
incidents of the night 

 come boyd she cried as she 
arose from the bed you must leave 
the house i never entertain visitors 
after this hour it is my custom i 
thank you for your protection at the 
theatre but you must go home 

her manner was calm and self- 



i turned to her in perfect 
amazement 

 i will not leave the house i 
said as a dim vision of being attacked 
by assassins on the stairway arose to 
my mind 

 there is devil -bug and his cut 
throat negroes thought i no 
thing so easy as to give me a cliff 
with a knife from some dark corner 
nothing so secret as my burial-place 
in some dark hole in the cellar 

 i won t go home said i aloud 

emily looked at me in perfect 
wonder it may have been affected 
and it may have been real 

 well then i must go down stairs 
to get something to eat she said 
in the most natural manner in the 
world i usually eat something 
about this hour 

 you may eat old devil-bug and 
bis niggers if you like i replied 
aughing but out of this house my 
father s son don t stir till broad day- 
ight 

with a careless laugh she wound 
her night gow i round her opened the 
door and disappeared in the dark 
down down down i could hear hex 
go her footsteps echoing along the 
stairway of the old mansion down 
down down in a few moments all 
was still 

here i was in a pretty fix in 
a lonely room at midnight ignorant 
of the passages of the wizard s den 
without arms and with the pleasant 
prospect of the young lady coming 
jack with devil-bug and his niggera 
o despatch me i had heard the cry 
of murder so ran my reasoning 



the merchant s daughter 



 they that is the murderers would 
suspect that i was a witness to their 
guilt and of course would send me 
down some d d trap-door on an 
especial message o the devil 

this was decidely a bad case i 
began to look around the room for 
some chance of escape some arms to 
defend myself or perhaps from a 
motive of laudible curiosity to know 
something more about the place where 
my death was to happen 

one moment regular as the ticking 
of a clock the room would be illumi 
nated by a flash of red light from the 
fire-place the next it would be dark as 
a grave seizing the opportunity af 
forded by the flash i observed some 
of the details of the room on the 
right side of the fire-place there was a 
closet the door fastened to the post by 
a very singular button shaped like a 
diamond about as long as your little 
finger and twice as thick on the 
other side of the fire-place near the 
ceiling was a small oblong window 
about as large as two half sheets of 
writing paper pasted together at the 
ends here let me explain the use of 
this window the back part of monk- 
hall is utterly destitute of windows 
light faint and dim you may be sure 
is admitted from tie front by small 
windows placed in the wall of each 
room how many rooms there are 
on a floor i know not but be they five 
or ten or twenty they are all lighted 
in this way 

well as i looked at this window i 
perceived one corner of the curtain on 
fhe other side was turned up this 
gave me very unpleasant ideas i 
almost fancied i beheld a human face 
pressed against the glass looking at 



me then the flash on the hearth 
died away and all was dark i heard 
a faint creaking noise the light from 
the hearth again lighted the place 
could i believe my eyes the button 
on the closet-door turned slowly round 

slowly slowly slowly it turned 
making a slight grating noise this 
circumstance slight as it may appear 
to you filled me with horror what 
could turn the button but a human 
hand slowly slowly it turned and 
the door sprung open with a whizzing 
sound all was dark again the 
cold sweat stood out on my forehead 
was my armed murderer waiting to 
spring at my throat i passed a mo 
ment of intense horror at last 
springing hastily forward i swung 
the door shut and fastened the button 
i can swear that i fastened it as tight 
as ever button was fastened regain 
ing the bed i silently awaited the 
result another flash of light great 
god i could swear there was a 
face pressed against the oblong win 
dow another moment and it is 
darkness creak creak creak is 
that the sound of the button again it 
was light again and there before my 
very eyes the button moved slowly 
round slowly slowly slowly 

the door flew open again i sat 
still as a statue i felt it difficult to 
breathe was my enemy playing 
with me like the cat ere she destroys 
her game 

i absently extended my hand it 
touched the small black stick given 

me by the landlord of the hotel 

in the beginning of the evening i 
drew it to me like a friend grasp 
ing it with both hands i calculated 
the amount of service it might do me 



the monks of monk-hall 



and as i grasped it the top seemed 
parting from the lower portion of the 
cane great god it was a sword 
cane ha-ha i could at least strike 
one blow my murderers should not 
despatch me without an effort of resis 
tance you see my arm is none of 
the puniest in the world i may say 
fhat there are worse men than boyd 
merivale for a fight 

clutching the sword-cane i rushed 
forward and standing on the threshold 
of the opened door i made a lunge 
with all my strength through the dark 
ness of the recess though i extend 
ed my arm to its full length and the 
sword was not less than eighteen 
inches long yet to my utter astonish 
ment i struck but the empty air 
another lunge and the same result 

things began to grow rather queer 
i was decidedly beat out as they say 
i shut the closet door again retreated 
to the bed sword in hand and awaited 
the result i heard a sound but it 
was the footstep of poor emily who 
that moment returned with a bed-lamp 
in one hand and a small waiter sup 
plied with a boiled chicken and a bot 
tle of wine in the other there was 
nothing remarkable in her look her 
face was calm and her boiled chicken 
and bottle of wine decidedly common 
place 

 great god she cried as she 
gazed in my countenance what 
is the matter with you your face is 
quite livid and your eyes are fairly 
starting from their sockets 

 good reason said i as i felt 
lhat my lips were clammy and white 
 that d d button has been going 
omd ever since you left and that 



d d door has been springing open 
every time it was shut 

ha-ha-ha she laughed 
 would it have sprung open if you 
had not shut it 

this was a very clear question and 
easy to answer but 

 mark you my lady said i 
 here am i in a lonely house under 
peculiar circumstances i am waked 
up by the cry of murder a door 
springs open without a hand being 
visible a face peers at me through 
a window as a matter of course i 
suspect there has been foul work done 
here to-night and through every 
room of this house emily you must 
lead the way while i follow this good 
sword in hand if the light goes out 
or if you blow it out you are to be 
pitied for in either case i swear by 
living god i will run you through 
with this sword 

 ha-ha-ha she fairly screamed 
with laughter as she sprung to the 
closet door behold the mystery 

and with her fair fingers she point 
ed to the socket of the button and to 
the centre of the door the door had 
been sprung as it is termed by tho 
weather that is the centre bulged 
inward leaving the edge toward the 
door-post to press the contrary direc 
tion the socket of the button by 
continual wear had been increased to 
twice its original size whenever the 
door was first buttoned the head of 
the screw pressed against one of the 
edges of the socket in a moment tho 
pressure of the edge of the door which 
you will remember was directed out 
ward dislodged the head of the screw 
and it sank vvell-nih half an inch 



the merchant s daughter 



into the worn socket of the button 
then the button removed farther 
from the door than at first would 
slowly turn and the door spring open 
all this was plain enough and i smiled 
at my recent fright 

 very good emily i laughed 
 but the mystery of this sword 
what of that i made a lunge in the 
closet and it touched nothing 

 you are suspicious boyd she 
answered with a laugh but the 
fact is the closet is rather a deep 
one 

 rather said i and so are 
you my dear 

there may have been something 
very meaning in my manner but cer 
tainly although her full black eyes 
looked fixedly on me yet i thought 
her face grew a shade paler as i 
spoke 

 and my dear i continued 
 what do you make of the face peep 
ing through the window 

 all fancy all fancy she re 
plied but as she spoke i saw her eye 
glance hurriedly toward the very win 
dow did she too fear that she might 
behold the face 

 we will search the closet i 
remarked throwing open the door 
 what have we here nothing but 
an old cloak hanging to a hook let s 
try it with my sword 

again i made a lunge with my 
ssvord again i thrust at the empty 
air 

 emily there is a room beyond 
this cloak you will enter first if you 
please remember my warning about 
the light if you please 

 oh now that i remember this 
cioset does open into the next room 



she said gaily althougi her cheek 
so it struck me grew jl little paler 
and her lip trembled slightly i 
had quite forgotten the circum 
stance 

enter emily and don t forget 
the light 

she flung the door aside and passed 
on with the light in her hand i fol 
lowed her we stood in a small room 
lighted like the other by an oblong 
window there was no other window 
no door no outlet of any sort even 
a chimney-place was wanting in one 
corner stood a massive bed the quilf 
was unruffled two or three old 
fashioned chairs were scattered round 
the room and from the spot where i 
stood looking over the foot of the bed 
 could see the top of another chair 
and nothing more between the bed 
and the wall 

a trifling fact in emily s behavioui 
may be remarked the moment the 
ight of the lamp which she held in her 
land flashed round the room she 
urned to me with a smile and leading 
he way round the corner of the foot 
of the bed asked me in a pleasant 
voice did i see any thing remarkable 
there 

she shaded her eyes from the lamp 
as she spoke and toyed me playfully 
under the chin you will bear in 
mind that at this moment i had turn 
ed my face toward the closet by which 
we had entered my back was there 
fore toward the part of the room mos 
remote from the closet it was a tri 
fling fact but i may as well tell you 
that the manner in which emily held 
the light threw that portion of the 
room between the foot of the bed and 
the wall in complete shadow while 



the monks of monk-hall 



the rest of the chamber was bright as 
day 

smilingly emily toyed me under 
the chin and at that moment i thought 
she looked extremely beautiful 

by jove i wish you could have 
seen her eyes shine and her cheek 
lord bless you a full blown rose 
wasn t a circumstance to it she 
looked so beautiful in fact as she 
came sideling up to me that i stepped 
backward in order to have a full view 
of her before i pressed a kiss on her 
pouting lips i did step back and did 
kiss her it wasn t singular perhaps 
but her lips were hot as a coal again 
she advanced to me again chucked 
me under the chin again i stepped 
back to look at her again i wished to 
taste her lips so pouting but rather 
warm when 

to tell you the truth stranger even 
at this late day the remembrance 
makes my blood run cold 

when i heard a sound like 

the sweeping of a tree-limb against 
a closed shutter it was so faint and 
distant and a stream of cold air came 
rushing up my back 

i turned around carelessly to ascer 
tain the cause i took but a single 
glance and then by g d i 
sprung at least ten feet from the place 
there at my very back between the 
bed and the wall opposite its foot i 
beheld a carpeted space some three 
feet square sinking slowly down and 
separating itself from the floor i had 
stepped my foot upon the spring 
made ready for me to be sure and 
the tap-door sank below me 

you may suppose my feelings were 
somewhat excited in truth my 
heart for a moment felt as though it 



was turning to a bal of ice first 
looked at the trap-d jor and then at 
emily her face wls pale as ashes 
and she leaned trembling against the 
bedpost advancing sword in hand 
i gazed down the trap-door great 
god how dark and gloomy the pit 
looked from room to room from 
floor to floor a succession of traps 
had fallen far below it looked like 
a mile although that was but an ex 
aggeration natural to a highly excited 
mind far far below gleamed a light 
and a buzzing murmur came up this 
hatchway of death 

stooping slowly down sword in 
hand my eye on the alert for miss 
emily i disengaged a piece of linen 
from a nail near the edge of the trap 
door where the linen it was a shirt 
wristband had been fastened the car 
pet was slightly torn as though a man 
in falling had grasped it with his finger 
ends 

the wristband was in more correct 
language a ruffle for the wrist it 
came to my mind in this moment that 
i had often ridiculed paul western for 
his queer old bachelor ways among 
other odd notions he had worn ruf 
fles at his wrist as i gathered this 
little piece of linen in my grasp the 
trap-door slowly rose i turned to 
ook for miss emily she had changed 
tier position and stood pressing her 
band against the opposite wall 

 now miss emily my dear i 
cried advancing toward her give 
me a plain answer to a plain question 
and tell me what in the devil do 
you think of yourself 

perfectly white in the face she 
glided across the room and stood at the 
foot of the bed in her fcrmer position 



the merchant s daughter 



leaning against the post for support 
you will observe that her form con 
cealed the chair whose top i had only 
seen across the bed 

 step aside miss emily my dear 
 i said in as quiet a tone as i 
could command or you see my 
lady i ll have to use a little necessary 
force 

instead of stepping aside as a 
peaceable woman would have done 
she sits right down in the chair fixing 
those full black eyes of her s on my 
face with a glance that looked very 
much like madness 

extending my hand i raised her 
from the seat she rested like a dead 
weight in my arms she had fainted 
wrapped in her night-gown i laid her 
on the bed and then examined the 
chair in the corner something about 
this chair attracted my attention a 
coat hung over the round a blue 
coat with metal buttons a buff vest 
hung under this coat and a high 
stock with a shirt collar 

i knew these things at once they 
oelonged to my friend paul western 

 and so my lady i cried for 
getting that she had fainted mr 
western came home from the theatre 
to his rooms arrived just before us 
took off his coat and vest and stock 
and collar maybe was just about to 
take off his boots when he stepped 
on the spring and in a moment was 
in in h 

taking the light in one hand i 
dragged or carried her into the other 
room and laid her on the bed after 
half an hour or so she came to her 
senses 

lt you s e you see were her 
first words uttered with her eyes flash 



ing like live-coals and her lips white 
as marble you see i could not 
help it for my father s curse was upon 
him 

she laughed wildly and lay in my 
arms a maniac 

stranger i ll make a short story of 
the thing now how i watched her 
all night till broad day how i escaped 
from the house for mr devil-bug it 
seems didn t suspect i knew anything 
how i returned home without any news 
of paul western are matters as easy 
to conceive as tell 

why didn t i institute a search 
fiddle-faddle blazon my name to 
the world as a visiter to a bagnio 
sensible thing that and then al 
though i was sure in my own soul 
that the clothes which i had discovered 
belonged to paul western it would 
have been most difficult to establish 
this fact in court one word more 
and i have done 

never since that night has paul 
western been heard of by living man 
never since that night has emily 
walraven been seen in this breathing 
world you start let me whisper 
a word in your ear suppose emily 
joined in western s murder from mo 
tives of revenge what then were 
devil-bug s he of course was the 
real murderer why the money to be 
sure why be troubled with emily as 
a witness of his guilt or a sharer of 
his money this is rather a a 
dark house and it s my opinion 
stranger that he murdered her too 

ha-ha why here s all the room 
to ourselves all the club have either 
dissappeared or lie drunk on the floor 
i saw fitz-cowles i know him 
sneak off a few moments since i 



the monks of monk-hall 



could tell by his eye that he is after 
some devils-trick the parson has 
gone and the judge has gone the 
lawyer has fallen among the slain 
and so wishing you good night 
stranger i ll vanish beware of the 
monks of monk-hall 

byrnewood was alone 

his head was depressed his arms 
were folded and his eye gazing 
vacantly on the table shone and 
glistened with the internal agitation of 
his brain he sate there silent mo 
tionless awed to the very soul the 
story of the stranger had thrilled him 
to the heart had aroused a strange 
train of thought and now rested like 
an oppressive weight upon his brain 

byrnewood gazed around with a 
sudden effort he shook off the spell 
of absence which mingled with an 
incomprehensible feeling of awe had 
enchained his faculties he looked 
around the room he was indeed 
alone above him the hideous satyr 
chandelier still flared its red light 
ever the table over the mirror and 
along the gloomy wainscot of the 
walls around the table grouped in 
various attitudes of unconscious drunk 
enness lay the members of the 
drinking party the merry monks of 
monk-hall there lay the poet with 
his sanguine face shining redly in the 
light while his hand rested on the 
bare scalp of the wigless editor there 
snored some dozen merchants all 
doubled up together like the slain in 
battle and there a solitary doctor 
who had fallen asleep on his knees 
was dozing away with one eye wide 
open while his right hand brushed 
away a solitary fly from his pimpled 
nose 



the scene was not caicu iteo to 
produce the most serious feelings in 
the world there was inebriety 
as the refined phrase it in every 
shape inebriety on its face inebriety 
with its mouth wide open inebriety on 
its knees brushing a fly from its nose 
inebriety groaning grunting or snor 
ing inebriety doubled up mingled in 
a mass of limbs heads and bodies 
woven together or flat inebriety sim 
ly straightened out on its back with 
its nose performing a select overture 
of snores to be brief there scatter 
ed over the floor lay drunkenness 
as the vulgar will style it in every 
shape moddled after various patterns 
and taken by that ingenious artist the 
bottle fresh from real life 

raising his eyes from the prostrate 
members of the club byrnewood start- 
ed with involuntary surprise as he be 
held standing at the tables-head the 
black-robed figure of the skeleton- 
monk with his hand of bone flinging 
aloft the goblet while his fleshless 
brow glared in the light from the 
shadow of the falling cowl as 
the light flickered to and fro it gave 
the grinning teeth of the skeleton the 
appearance of life and animation for a 
single moment byrnewood thought 
he beheld the teeth move in a ghastly 
smile he even fancied that the orbless 
sockets gleaming beneath the white 
brow flashed with the glance of life 
and gazed sneeringly in his face 

he started with involuntary horror 
and then sate silent as before and 
as you can feel cold or heat steal ovei 
you by slow degrees so he felt that 
same strange feeling of awe which he 
had known that night for the first time 
in his life come slowly over him 



the merchant s daughter 



g like a shadow over his soul 
and stealing like a paralysis through 
his every limb he sate like a man 
suddenly frozen 

 my god he murmured and 
the sound of his voice frightened him 
 how strange i feel can this be 
the first attack of some terrible dis 
ease or is it but the effect of the 
horrible story related by the stranger 
i have read in books that a feeling like 
this steals over a man just before 
some terrible calamity breaks over his 
head this is fearful as death itself 

he was silent again and then the 
exclamation broke from his lips 

 lorrimer why does he not re 
turn he has been absent full an 
hour what does it mean can the 
words of that pshaw that fortune 
teller have any truth in them how 
can lorrimer injure me how can i 
injure him three days hence 
christmas ha ha i believe i m 
going mad there s cold sweat on 
my forehead 

as he spoke he raised his left hand 
lo his brow and in the action the 
gleam of a plain ring on his finger 
met his eye he kissed it suddenly 
and kissed it again and again was 
it the gift of his ladye-love 

 god bless her god bless her 
wo to the man who shall do her 
vrong and yet poor annie 

he rose suddenly from his seat and 
strode towards the door 

 i know not why it is but i feel as 
hough an invisible hand was urging 
me onward through the rooms of this 
house and onward i will go until 
 discover lorrimer or solve the mys 
tery of this den golt knows i 



feel pshaw i m only nervous 
as though i was walking to my death 
passing through the narrow door- 
way he cautiously ascended the dark 
staircase and in a moment stood on 
the first floor the moon was stil 
shining through the distant skylight 
down over the windings of the massive 
stairway all was silent as death 
within the mansion not a sound not 
even the murmur of a voice or the 
hushed tread of a footstep could be 
heard winding his cloak tighily 
around his limbs byrnewood rushed 
up the staircase traversing two steps 
at a time and treading softly for fear 
of discovery he reached the second 
floor still the place was silent and 
dismal still the column of moonlight 
pouring through the skylight over the 
windings of the staircase only render 
ed the surrounding darkness more 
gloomy and indistinct up the wind 
ing staircase he again resumed his 
way and in a moment stood upon the 
landing or hall of the third floor this 
was an oblong space with the doors 
of many rooms fashioned in its walls 
another stairway led upward from the 
floor but the attention of byrnewood 
was arrested by a single ray of light 
that for a moment flickered along the 
thick darkness of the southern end of 
the hall stepping forward hastily 
byrnewood found all progress arrested 
by the opposing front of a solid wall 
he gazed toward his left it was so 
dark that he could not see his hand 
before his eyes turning his glance 
to the right as his vision became 
more accustomed to the darkness he 
beheld the dim walls of a long corri 
dor at whose entrance he stood and 



the monks of monk-hall 



whose farther extreme was illumiied by 
a light that to all appearance flashed 
i rom an open door without a mo 
ment s thought he strode along the 
thickly carpeted passage of the corri 
dor he stood in the full glow of the 
light flashing from the open door 

looking through the doorway he 
beheld a large chamber furnished in a 
style of lavish magnificence and 
lighted by a splendid chandelier it 
was silent and deserted from the 
ceiling to the floor along the wall op 
posite the doorway hung a curtain of 
damask silk trailing in heavy folds 
along the gorgeous carpet impelled 
by the strange impulse that had urged 
him thus far byrnewood entered the 
chamber and without pausing to ad 
mire its gorgeous appointments strode 
forward to the damask curtain 

he swung one of its hangings aside 
expecting to behold the extreme wall 
of the chamber to his entire wonder 
another chamber as spacious as the 
one in which he stood lay open to his 
gaze the walls were all one gor 
geous picture evidently painted by a 
master-hand blue skies deep green 
forests dashing waterfalls and a cool 
calm lake in which fair women were 
laving their limbs broke on the eyes 
of the intruder as he turned his gaze 
from wall to wall a curtain of azure 
sprinkled with a border of golden 
leaves hung along the farther extre 
mity of the room in one corner 
stood a massive bed whose snow- 
white counterpane fell smoothly and 
unruffled to the very floor mingling 
with the long curtains which pure 
and stainless as the counterpane hung 
a ound the couch in graceful festoons 
 



like the wings of a bird guarding its 
resting place 

 the bridal-bed murmured 
byrnewood as he flung the curtains 
of gold and azure hurriedly aside 

a murmur of surprise mingled 
with admiration escaped from his 
lips as he beheld the small closet for 
it could scarcely be called a room 
which the undrawn curtaining threw 
open to his gaze 

it was indeed a small and elegant 
room lined along its four sides with 
drooping curtains of faint-hued crim 
son silk the ceiling itself was but a 
continuation of these curtains or 
hangings for they were gathered in 
the centre by a single star of gold 
the carpet on the floor was of the 
same faint-crimson color and the 
large sofa placed along one side of 
he apartment was covered with vel 
vet that harmonized in hue with both 
carpet and hangings on the snow- 
white cloth of a small table placed in 
the centre of the room stood a large 
wax candle burning in a candlestick 
of silver and flinging a subdued and 
mellow light around the plate there 
was a neat little couch standing in the 
corner with a toilette at its foot the 
quilt on the couch was ruffled as 
though some one had lately risen 
from it and the equipage of the toilette 
looked as though it had been recently 
used 

the faint light falling over the 
hangings whose hue resembled the 
first flush of day the luxurious sofa 
the neat though diminutive couch the 
small table in the centre the carpet 
whoee colors were in elegant harmony 
with the hue of the curtains all com 



 



the merchant s daughter 



bined gave the place an air of splen 
did comfort if we may join these 
incongruous words that indicated the 
sleeping chamber of a lovely woman 

 this has been the resting place of 
the bride murmured byrne wood 
gazing in admiration around the room 
 it looks elegant it is true but 
if she is the innocent thing lorrimer 
would have me believe then better for 
her to have slept in the foulest gutter 
of the streets than to have lain for an 
instant in this woman-trap 

there was a woman s dress a 
frock of plain black silk flung over 
one of the rounds of the sofa anxious 
to gather some idea of the form of the 
bride oh foul prostitution of the 
name from the shape of the dress 
byrnewood raised the frock and ex 
amined its details as he did this the 
sound of voices came hushed and 
murmuring to his ear from a room 
opposite the chamber which he had 
but a moment left half occupied in 
listening to these voices byrnewood 
glanced at the dress which he held in 
his hand and as he took in its various 
details of style and shape the pupil of 
his full black eye dilated and his 
cheek became colorless as death 

then the room seemed to swim 
around him and he pressed his hand 
forcibly against his brow as if to 
assure himself that he was not en 
tangled in the mazes of some hideous 
dream 

then letting his own cloak and 
the black silk dress fall on the floor at 
once he walked with a measured step 
toward that side of the room opposite 
the painted chamber 

the voices grew louder in the next 
room byrnewood listened in silence 



his face was even paler than before 
and you could see how desperate waa 
the effort which he made to suppress 
an involuntary cry of horror that 
came rising to his lips extending his 
hand he pushed the curtain slightly 
aside and looked into the next room 

the extended hand fell like a dead 
weight to his side 

over his entire countenance flashed 
a mingled expression of surprise and 
horror and woe that convulsed every 
feature with a spasmodic movement 
and forced his large black eyes from 
their very sockets for a moment he 
looked as if about to fall lifeless on the 
floor and then it was evident that he 
exerted all his energies to control this 
most fearful agitation he pressed 
both hands nervously against his fore 
head as though his brain was tortured 
by internal flame then he reared 
his form proudly erect and stood ap 
parently firm and self possessed al 
though his countenance looked more 
like the face of a corpse than the face 
of a living man 

and as he stood there silent and 
firm although his very reason tottered 
to its ruin there glided to his back 
like an omen of death pursuing the 
footsteps of life the distorted form of 
the door-keeper of monk-hall his huge 
bony arms npraised his hideous face 
convulsed in a loathsome grin while hife 
solitary eye glared out from its sunkera 
socket like a flame lighted in a skull 
grotesque yet terrible 

in vain was the momentary firm 
ness which byrnewood had aroused to 
his aid in vain was the effort that 
suppressed his breath that clenched 
his handsthat forced the clammy sweat 



mother nancy and long-haired bess 



from his brow he felt the awful 
agony that convulsed his soul rising 
to his lips he would have given the 
world to stifle it but in vain in vain 
were all his superhuman efforts 

one terrific howl like the yell of a 
man flung suddenly over a cataract 
broke from his lips he thrust aside 
the curtain and strode madly through 
its folds into the next room 



chapter eighth 

mother nancy and long-haired 
bess 

 so ye have lured the pretty dove 
into the cage at last said the old 
lady with a pleasant smile as she 
poised a nice morsel of buttered toast 
between her fingers this tea is 
most too weak a little more out of 
the caddy bessie dear lord who d 
a-thought you d a-caught the baby-face 
so easy does the kettle boil my

hour so it ought to be hissing hot by 
this time caught her at last hah- 
hah hey bessie you re a reg lar 
keen one i must say 

and with these mild words the old 
lady arranged the tea things on the 
small table covered with a neat white 
cloth and pouring out a cup of gun 
powder chuckled pleasantly to her 
self as though she and the buttered 
toast had a quiet little joke together 

 spankin cold night i tell ye 
mother nancy exclaimed the 
young lady in black as she flung ner- 
self in a chair and tossed her bonnet 



on the old sofa precious time i ve 
had with that little chit of a thing 
up one street and down another i ve 
been racing for this blessed hour 
and the regular white and black uns 
i ve been forced to tell oh crickey

while the tall and queenly bessie 
is engaged in securing a drop of the 
lively we will take a passing glance 
at mother perkins the respectable 
lady abbess of monk-hall 

as she sate in that formal arm-chair 
straight and erect her portly form clad 
in sombre black with a plain white 
collar around her neck and a bunch of 
keys at her girdle mother nancy 
looked for all the world like a quiet 
old body whose only delight was to 
scatter blessings around her give 
large alms to the poor and bestow 
unlimited amounts of tracts among the 
vicious a good dear old body was 
mother nancy although her face was 
not decidedly preposessing a low 
forehead surmounted by a perfect

had showered their sins and cares anc 
crimes without making the dear olc 
lady for a moment pause in her ca 



reer 



and such a career god of hea 
ven did womanhood which in its 
dawn or bloom or full maturity is so 
beautiful which even in its decline is 
lovely which in trembling old age is 
venerable did womanhood ever sink 
so low as this how many of the 
graves in an hundred churchyards 
graves of the fair and beautiful had 
been dug by the gouty hands of the 
vile old hag who sate chuckling in her 
quiet arm-chair how many of the 
betrayed maidens found rotting on the 
rivers waves dangling from the garret 
rafter starving in the streets or resting 
vile and loathsome in the green 
house how many of these will at the 
last day when the accounts of this 
lovely earth will be closed forever 
rise up and curse the old hag with 
their ruin with their shame with their 
unwept death 

the details of the old lady s room 
by no means indicated her disposition 
or the course of her life it was a 
fine old room with walls neatly paper- 



the house for the unknown dead 



warmed by a cheerful wood fire blaz 
ing on the spacious hearth one whole 
side of the room seemed to have been 
attacked with some strange eruptive 
disease and broken out into an ery 
sipelas of cupboards and closets aq 
old desk that might have told a world 
of wonders of noah s ark from its own 
personal experience could it have 
spoken stood in one corner and a 
large side- board on whose top a fat 
fellow of a decanter seemed drilling 
some raw recruits of bottles and 
glasses into military order occupied 
one entire side of the room or cell of 
the lady abbess 

there are few persons in the world 
who have not a favourite of some kind 
either a baby or a parrot or a canary 
or a cat or in desperate cases a pig 
mother nancy had her favourite as 
well as less reputable people a 
huge bull dog with sore eyes and a 
ragged tail that seemed to have been 
purchased at a second-had store during 
the hard times lay nestling at the 
old lady s feet looking very much like 
he candidate whom all the old and 
surly dogs would choose for alder 
man in case the canine race had the 
drivilege of electing an officer of that 
lonorable class among themselves 
phis dog so old bachelor-like and 
aldermanic in appearance the old lady 
was wont to call by the name of 
dolph being the short lor dolphin 
of which remarkable fish the animal 
was supposed to be a decided copy 

here s the lively mother nancy 
 observed miss bessie as she re 
sumed her seat at the supper table 
it s the real hot stuff and no mistake 
the oysters if you please a ittle o f 



mother nancy and long-haired-bess 



that pepper any mustard there now 
then moth i- let s be comfortable 

 but observed the old lady pour 
ing a glass of the lively from a de 
canter labelled brandy but bessie 
my love i m a-waitin to hear all about 
this little dove whom you trapped to 
night 

it may be as well to remark that 
bessie was a tall queenly girl of some 
iwenty five with a form that had once 
been beautiful beyond description and 
even now in its ruinswas lovely to look 
upon while her faded face marked by 
a high brow and raven-black hair 
was still enlivened by the glance of 
two large dark eyes that were suscep- 
table of any expression love or hate 
revenge or jealousy anything but 
fear her complexion was a very 
faint brown with a deep rose-tint on 
each cheek she was still beautiful 
although a long career of dissipation 
had given a faded look to the outlines 
of her face indenting a slight wrinkle 
between her arching brows and slight 
ly discoloring the flesh beneath each 
eye 

this here lively is first rate 
after the tramp i ve had said bes 
sie as her eyes grew brighter with the 
lively effects of the bottle you 
know mother nancy its three weeks 
since gus mentioned the thing to me

jove for himself something above the

track himself 

he did did he ah deary me but 
gus is a regular lark you can t per- 
duce his ekle 

one day strolling up third street 
gus was attracted by the sight of a 
pretty girl sitting at the window of a 
wealthy merchant who has just re 
tired from business you ve heard of 
old arlington try the lively 
mother gus made some enquiries 
found that the young lady had just re 
turned from the moravian boarding 
school at bethlehem she was inno 
cent inexperienced and all that suit 
ed lorrimers taste he swore he d 
have her 

so you undertook to catch her 
did ye butter my dear 

that did i the way i managed 
it was a caution dressing myself in 
solemn black i strolled along third 
street one mild winter evening some 
two weeks since mary that s her 
name was standing at the front door 
gazing carelessly down the street 
i tripped up the steps and asked in my 
most winning tone 

you can act the lady when you 
like bess that s a fact 

whether mr elmwood lived there 
of course she answered no but in 
making an apology for my intrusion i 









the merchant s daughter 



managed to state that mr elmwood 
was my uncle that i had just come to 
the city on a visitand had left my aunt s 
in spruce street but a few moments 
ago thinking to pay a nice little call on 
my dear old relative 

just like you bessie so you scrap 
ed acquaintance with her 

fresh from boarding school as 
ignorant of the world as the babe un 
born the girl was interested in me i 
suppose and swallowed the white uns 
i told her without a single suspicion 
the next day about noon i met her 
is she was hurrying to see an old 
aunt who lived two or three squares 
below her father s house she was all 
in a glow for she had been hurrying 
along rather fast anxious to reach her 
aunt s house as soon as possible i 
spoke to her proposed a walk she 
assented with a smile of pleasure i 
i told her a long story of my sorrows 
how i had been engaged to be married 
how my lover had died of consump 
tion but a month ago that he was 
sich a nice young man with curly hair 
and hazel eyes and that i was in black 
for his death i put peach fur over 
her eyesby whole hand s full i tell you 
the girl was interested and like all 
young girls she was delighted to be 
come the confidante of an amiable 
young lady who had a little love-ro 
mance of real life to disclose oys 
ters mother nancy 

the long and short of it was that 
you wormed yourself into her confi 
dence that it my dear keep 
still dolph or dolph s mommy would 
drop little bit of hot tea on dolph s 
head 

we walked out together for three 
days just toward dark in the evening 



you can fancy mother how wouna 
myself into the heart of this young 
girl closer and closer every day i 
tightened the cords that bound us arid 
on the third evening i believe she would 
have died for me 

well well child when did gusty 
first speak to her a little more of 
the gunpowder my dear 

one evening i persuaded her to take 
a stroll along chesnut street with me 
gus was at our heels you may be sure 
he passed on a little-a-head determin 
ing to speak to her at all hazards she 
saved him the trouble lord love you 
mother nancy she spoke to him 
first 

be still dolph be still dolph-ee 
now bessie that s a leetle too strong 
not the tea but the story she so in- 
nocent and baby-like speak first to - 
strange man ask me to believe in 
tea made out of turnip tops will ye 

she mistook him for a mr bel- 
mont whom she had seen at bethlehem 
he did not undeceive her until she 
was completely in his power he 
walked by her side that evening up 
and down chesnut street for nearly 
an hour i saw at once that her girl 
ish fancy was caught by his smooth 
tongue and handsome form the 
next night he met us again and the 
next and the next lord pity her 
the poor child was now entirely at his 
mercy 

ha ha gusty is sich a devil 
put the kettle on the fire my dear 
let s try a little of the lively and 
how did she this baby-faced doll 
keep these walks secret from the eyes 
of her folks eh bessie 

easy as that replied bessie 
gracefully snapping her fingers 



mother nancy and long-haired-bess 



 every time she went out she told 
father and mother that she went to 
see her old aunt i hinted at first 
that our friendship would be more ro 
mantic if concealed from all intrusive 
eyes the girl took the hint lor- 
rimer with his smooth tongue told her 
a long story about his eccentric uncle 
who had sworn he should not marry 
for years to come and therefore he 
was obliged to keep his attentions to 
her hidden from both of their families 
gusty was dependent on this old un 
cle you know once married the 
old uncle would relent as he be 
held the beauty and innocence of the 
young wife so gusty made her 
believe you can imagine the whole 
trap we had her in our power 
last night she consented to leave her 
home for lor rimer s fami ly mansion 
he was to marry her the approval of 
his uncle that imaginary old gen 
tleman was to be obtained and on 
christmas eve mr and ha ha 
ha - - mistress lorrimer were to rush 
into old middleton s house fall on their 
knees invoke the old man s blessing 
be forgiven and be happy hand us

forts of a home to the smile of a fa 
ther the love of a mother as she 
have i not been robbed of all these 
of all that is most sacred to woman

than i was when the devil in human 
shape first dragged me from my home 
i feel happy aye happy when i 
can drag another woman into the same 
foul pit where i am doomed to lie and 
rot j 

yet this thing was so innocent 
cried the good old lady patting dolph 
on the head i confess i laugh 
at ail qualms all petty scruples but 
you were so different when first i knew 
you you emily you 

emily shrieked the other as 
she sprung suddenly to he feet 
you hag of the devil call me by 
that name again and as god will judge 
at the last day i ll throttle you 
she shook her clenched hand across 
the table and her eyes were bloodshot 
with sudden rage emily 
your mother called you by that namje 
when a little child she cried with 
j a burst of feeling most fearful to be 



hold in one so fallen your fa- 



j ther blessed you by that name the 

j night before you fled from his roof 

emily aye ae the foul betray 



to 



the merchant s daughter 



er whispered that name with a smile 
as he entered the chambei from which 
he never came forth again you re

ther nancy abuse me bessie 
dear but not so loud down dolph 
don t mind the girl she s mad not

fallen girl as with her tall form raised 
to its full height she fixed her flashing 
eye on vacancy he enters the room 

that room with the the trap-door 
you know good night emily he 
said and smiled emily and my 
father had cursed him i laid me 
down and rested by another man s 
side he thought i slept slept ha 
ha when with my entire soul i 
listened to the footsteps in the next 
room ha ha when i heard the 
creaking sound of the falling trap 
when i drank in the cry of agony 
when i heard that name emily oh 
emily come shrieking up the pit of 
death my father had cursed him 
and he died emily oh my god 
and she wrung her hands in very agony 
 roll back the years of my life

me oh god you are all powerful 
and can do it let me be a child 
again a little child and though i 
crawl through life in the rags of a 
beggar i will nevr cease to bless 
oh god to bless your name 

she fell heavily to her seat and 
covering her face with her hands wept 
the scalding tears of guilt and shame 

 gal s been a-takin opium 
said the old lady calmly and the 
fit s cono on her sarven her right 



told her never to mix ler brandy 
with opium 

 did i regret having undertaken 
the ruin of the girl said bess in a 
whisper that made even the old lady 
start with surprise regret i tell 
ye old hell-dame as you are that my 
very heart strings seemed breaking 
within me to-night as i led her from 
her home 

 what the d did you do it for 
then here s a nice dolph eat a 
piece o buttered toast that s a good 
dolph-ee 

when the seducer first assailed 
me continued bess in an absent 
tone he assailed a woman with a 
mind stored with knowledge of the 
world s ways a soul full as crafty as 
his own a wit sharp and keen as ever 
dropped poison or sweetness from a 
woman s tongue but this girl so 
child-like so unsuspecting so inno 
cent my god how it wrung my 
heart when i first discovered that she 
loved lorrimer loved him without one 
shade of gross feeling loved him with 
out a doubt warmly devotedly with 
all the trustfulness of an angel-soul 
fresh from the hands of god never 

bird fell more helplessly into the 
yawning jaws of the snake that had 
charmed it to ruin than poor mary 
ell into the accursed wiles of lorri- 
ner and yet i aided him 

 so you did the more shame for 
you to harm sich a dove go up stairs 
my dear and let her loose we ll 
consent won t we ha-ha why 
ess i thought you had more sense 
han to go on this way what will 
become of you 

 i suppose that i will die in the 
same ditch where the souls of so many 



the bride 



of my vile sisterhood have crept forth 
from their leprous bodies eh mother 
nance die in a ditch emily die 
in a ditch and then in the next 
world ha ha ha i see a big lake 
of fire on which souls are dancing 
like rnoths in a candle ha ha ha 

i reely gal you must leave off 
that opium gus promised you some 
five or six hundred if you caught this 
al and you can t go back now 

 yes yes i know it i know it 
forward s the word if the next step 
plunges me in hell 

and the girl buried her face in her 
hands and was silent again let not 
the reader wonder at the mass of con 
tradictions heaped together in the 
character of this miserable wreck of a 
woman one moment conversing in 
the slang of a brothel like a thing 
lapped from her birth in pollution the 
next whispering forth her ravings in 
language indicative of the educated 
woman of her purer days one instant 
glorying in her shame the next recoil 
ing in horror as she viewed the dark 
path which she had trodden the 
darker path which she was yet to 
read these paradoxes are things of 
every day occurrence only to be ex 
plained when the mass of good and 
evil found in every human heart is 
divided into distinct parts no more to 
mingle in one no more to occasion an 
eternal contest in the self-warring 
heart of manj 

 well well bessie go to bed 
and sleep a little that s a dear 
said the old lady with a pleasing 
smile opium isn t good for you 
and you know it a leetle nap ill do 
you good sleep a bit and then you ll 
he right fresh for the wedding three 



o clock you know corne along 
dolph mommy must go tend to some 
little things about the house come 
along dolph-ee sleep a leetle bes 
sie that s a dear 



chapter ninth 

the bride 

a chapter in which every woman may find 

some leaves of her own heart read with 
the eyes of a high and holy love 

 mary 

oh sweetest name of woman name 
by which some of us may hail a wife 
or a sister in heaven name so soft and 
rippling and musical name of the 
mother of jesus made holy by poetry 
and religion how foully were you 
profaned by the lips that whispered 
your sound of gentleness in the sleep 
er s ear 

 mary 

the fair girl stirred in her sleep 
and her lips dropped gently apart as 
she whispered a single word 

 lorraine 

 the assumed name of lorrimer 
 exclaimed the woman who stood 
by the bedside gus has some taste 
even in his vilest loves but with 
this girl this child good heaven 
how refined he shrunk at the very 
idea of her voice whispering the name 
which had been shouted by his devigt 
mates at a drinking bout so he to -j 
the girl to call him fcot gusty no 
no but something musical lot 
raine 

and stooping over the the couclu 
the queenly woman with her proud

the merchant s daughter 



form arrayed in a dress of snow 
white silk and her raven-black hair 
gathered in thick tresses along her 
neck so full and round applied her 
lips to the ear of the sleeper and 
whispered in a softened tone 

 mary awake it is your wed 
ding night 

the room was still as death not 
a sound save the faint breathing of the 
sleeper all hushed and still the 
light of the wax candle standing on 
the table in the centre of the rose 
chamber as it was called fell 
mild and softened over the hangings 
of faint crimson with the effect of 
evening twilight 

the maiden pure and without 
stain lay sleeping on the small 
couch that occupied one corner of the 
closet her fair limbs were enshroud 
ed in the light folds of a night-robe 
and she lay in an attitude of perfect 
repose one glowing cheek resting 
upon her uncovered arm while over 
the other waved the loosened curls 
of her glossy hair the parting lips 
disclosed her teeth white as ivory 
while her youthful bosom came heav 
ing up from the folds of her night- 
robe like a billow that trembles for a 
moment in the moonlight and then is 
suddenly lost to view she lay there 
in all the ripening beauty of maiden 
hood the light falling gently over her 
young limbs their outlines marked by 
the easy folds of her robe resembling 
in their roundness and richness of pro 
portion the swelling fulness of the 
rose-bud that needs but another beam 
of light to open it into its perfect 
bloom 

the arihing eyebrows the closed 



lids with the long lashes resting on 
the cheek the parted lips and r he 
round chin with its smiling dimple 
all these were beautiful but oh how 
fair and beautiful the maiden s dreams 
rosier than her cheek sweeter thaa 
her breath lovelier than her kiss 
lovely as her own stainless soul on 
whose leaves was written but one 
motto of simple meaning love in 
life in death and for ever 

and in all her dreams she beheld 
but one form heard the whisper of 
but one voice shared the sympathies 
of but one heart he was her dream 
her life her god him had she trust 
ed with her all in earth or heaven 
him did she love withfthe uncalcu- 
lating abandonment of self that marks 
the first passion of an innocent wo 
man j 

 and was there aught of earth in 
this love did the fever of sensual 
passion throb in the pulses of her vir 
gin blood did she love loiimer be 
cause his eye was bright his form 
magnificent his countenance full of 
healthy manliness no no no 
shame on the fools of either sex who 
read the first love of a stainless wo 
man with the eyes of sense she 
loved lorrimer for a something which 
he did not possess which vile world 
lings of his class never will possess 
for the magic with which her fancy 
had enshrouded his face arid form she 
loved him for the wierd fascination 
which her own soul had flung around 
his very existence for a dream of 



 the reader who desires to understand 
thoroughly the pure love of an innocent girl 
for a corrupt libertine will not fail to peruse 
this passage 



the bride 



 



which he was the idol for a waking 
irance in which he walked as her 
good angel for imagination for fancy 
ibr any thing but sense she loved 
aim 

it was her first love 

she knew not that this fluttering 
fascination which bound her to his 
slightest look or tone like the 
charmed bird to the lulling music 
which the snake is said to murmur 
as he ensnares his prey she knew 
not that this fluttering fascination was 
but the blind admiration of the moth 
as it floats in the light of the flame 
which will at last consume it 

she knew not that in her own or 
ganization were hidden the sympa 
thies of an animal as well as of an 
intellectual nature that the blood in 
her veins only waited an opportunity 
to betray her that in the very atmos 
phere of the holiest love of woman 
crouched a sleeping fiend who at the 
first whisperings of her wronger 
would arise with hot breath and blood 
shot eyes to wreak eternal ruin on her 
woman s-honor 

r for this is the doctrine we deem it 
right to hold in regard to woman 
like man she is a combination of an 
animal with an intellectual nature 
unlike man her animal nature is a 
passive thing that must be roused ere 
it will develope itself in action let 
the intellectual nature of woman be 
the only object of man s influence and 
woman will love him most holily 
but let him play with her animal na 
ture as you would toy with the ma 
chinery of a watch let him rouse the 
treacherous blood let him fan the j 
pulse into quick feverish throbbings j 
let him varm the heart with convulsive i 



beatings and the woman becomes 
like himself but a mere animal 
sense rises like a vapor and utterly 
darkens soul 

and shall we heap shame on wo 
man because man neglecting her ho 
liest nature may devote all the ener 
gies which god has given him to rouse 
her gross and earthy powers into ac 
tion on whose head is the shame 
or whose the wrong i oh would man 
but learn the solemn truth that no 
angel around god s throne is purer 
than woman when her intellectual na 
ture alone is stirred into developement 
that no devil crouching in the flames 
of hell is fouler than woman when 
her animal nature alone is roused into 
action would man but learn and re 
vere this fearful truth would woman 
but treasure it in her inmost soul then 
would never a shriek arise to heaven 
heaping curses on the betrayer s head 
then would never a wrong done to 
maiden virtue give the suicide s grave 
its victim then in truth would woman 
walk the earth the spirit of light that 
the holiest lover ever deemed her 

and the maiden lay dreaming of 
her lover while the form of the tall 
and stately woman stood by the bed 
side ike her evil angel as with a 
mingled smile and sneer she bade the 
girl arise for it was her wedding night 
her wedding night f 

mary awake it is your wed 
ding night 

mary murmured in her sleep and 
then opened her large blue eyes and 
arose in the couch 

has he come were the first 
words she murmured in her musical 
tones that came low and softened to 
the listeners ear has he come 



 



the merchant s daughter 



not yet not yet my dear 
said long-haired bess assisting the 
young maiden to rise from the couch 
with all imaginable tenderness of man 
ner you see mary love it s 
half-past two o clock and over and 
of course high time for you to dress 
throw back your night-gown my love 
and let me arrange your hair how 
soft and silky it needs but little aid 
from my hands to render each tress 
a perfect charm 

is it not very strange bessie 
said mary opening her large blue eyes 
with a bewildered glance as she spoke 

what is strange i see nothing 
strange except the remarkable beauty 
of these curls 

that i should first meet him in 
such a singular manner that he should 
love me that for his sake i should fly 
to his uncle s mansion and that you 
bessie my dear good friend should 
consent from mere friendship to leave 
your home and bear me company 
ail this is very strange how like 
the stories we read in a book and 
his stern old uncle you say has re 
lented 

perfectly resigned to the match 
my dear that s the way with all 
these relations is not that curl per 
fect when they ve made all the mis 
chief they can and find it amounts to 
nothing at the last moment they roll 
up their eyes and declare with a 
sigh that they re resigned to the 
match and his dear old grand-ma 
she lives here you know there 
that is right your curls should fall 
in a shower over your snow-white 
nec k the dear old lady is in a per 
fect fever to see you she helped me 



to get every thing read y foi the wed 
ding 

oh bessie is it not most sad 
said mary as her blue eyes shone with 
a glance of deep feeling to think 
that albert and you should love one 
another so fondly and after all that 
he should die leaving you alone in this 
cheerless world how terrible if 
lorraine should die 

a deep shade of feeling passed over 
mary s face and her lip trembled 
bessie held her head down for a mo 
ment as her fair fingers ran twining 
among the tresses of the bride was 
it to conceal a tear or a smile 

alas he is in his grave yet 
it is the memory of his love that makes 
me take such a warm interest in your 
union with lorraine this plain fil 
let of silver with its diamond star - 
how well it becomes your brow 
you never yet found a woman who 
knew what it was to love that would 
not fight for two true-hearted lovers 
against the world do you think 
mary dear that i could have sanc 
tioned your flight to this house if my 
very soul had not been interested in 
your happiness not i not i 
now slip off your night-gown my 
dear have you seen the wedding 
dress 

it seems to me said mary 
whose thoughts dwelt solely on her 
love for lorrimer that there is 
something deeply touching in a wed 
ding that is held at this hour of the 
 night every thing is calm and tran- 
quil the earth lies sleeping while 
heaven itself watches over the union 
i of two hearts that are all in all to 
each other 



the bride 



the words look plain and simple 
out the tone in which she spoke was 
one of the deepest feeling her very 
soul was in her words her blue eyes 
dilated with a sudden enthusiasm and 
the color went and came along her 
glowing cheek until it resembled a 
fair flower one moment resting in the 
shade the next bathing in the sunlight 

let me assist you to put on this 
wedding dress is it not beautiful 
that boddice of white silk was lor- 
rimer s taste to be sure i gave the 
dress-maker a few hints is it not per 
fect how gently the folds of the 
skirt rest on your figure it is a per 
fect fit i do declare why mary 
you are too beautiful well well 
handsome as he is lorrimer ought to 
be half crazy with vanity when such 
a bride is hanging on his arm 

a few moments sufficed to array 
the maiden for the bridal 

mary stood erect on the floor blush 
after blush coursing over her cheek 
as she surveyed the folds of her gor 
geous wedding dress 

itjvas in truth a dress most worthy 
of her face and form from the shoul 
ders to the waist her figure was en 
veloped in a boddice of snow-white 
satin that gathered over her swelling 
bosom with such gracefulness of shape 
that every beauty of her form the 
width of the shoulders and the gra 
dual falling off of the outline of the 
waist was clearly perceptible 

fitting closely around the bust 
it gave to view her fair round neck 
half-concealed by the drooping curls of 
glossy hair and a glimpse of each shoul 
der so delicate and white swelling 
away into the fullness of the virgin 
bosom that rose heaving above the 



border of lace from the waist down- 
ward in many a fold but with per 
feet adaptation to her form the gor 
geous skirt of satin fell sweeping to 
the floor leaving one small and tiny 
foot enclosed in a neat slipper that 
clung to it as though it had grown 
there exposed to the eye 

the softened light falling over the 
rose-hued hangings of the room 
threw the figure of the maiden out 
from the dim back- ground in gentle 
and effective prominence her 
brown tresses showering down over 
each cheek and falling along her 
neck and shoulders waved gently to 
and fro and caught a glossy richness 
from the light her fair shoulders 
her full bosom her long but not too 
slender waist the downward propor 
tions of her figure swelling with the 
full outlines of ripening maidenhood 
all arrayed in the graceful dress of 
snow-white satin stood out in the dim 
light relieved most effectively by the 
rose-hued hangings in the back 
ground 

as yet her arms unhidden by sleeve 
or robe gave their clear transparent 
skin their fullness of outline their 
perfect loveliness of shape all freely 
to the light 

is it not a gorgeous dress said 
long-haired bess as she gazed with 
unfeigned admiration upon the face 
and form of the beautiful maiden 
 as gorgeous dear mary as you are 
beautiful 

 oh it will be such a happy time 
cried mary in a tone that scarcely 
rose above a whisper while her blue 
eyes flashed with a glance of deep 
emotion there will sit my father 
and there my mother in t e cheerful 



 



the merchant s daughter 



parlor on christmas eve my father s 
grey hairs and my mother s kindly 
face will be lighted up by the same 
glow of light and their eyes will be 
heavy with tears with weeping for 
me bessie their lost child as they 
will call me when behold the door 
opens lorraine enters with me his 
wife yes yes his wife by his side 
we fling ourselves at the feet of our 
father and mother for they will be 
oars then we crave their forgive 
ness lorraine calls me his wife 
we beg their forgiveness and their 
blessing in the same breath oh it 
will be such a happy time and my 
brother he will be there too he will 
like lorraine for he has a noble 
heart don t you see the picture 
bessie i see it as plainly as though 
it was this moment before me and 
my father oh how he will weep 
when again he clasps his daughter in 
his arms 

there she stood her fair hands 
clasped trembling together her eyes 
flashing in ecstacy while her heart 
throbbing and throbbing like some 
wild bird endeavoring to burst the bars 
of its cage sent her boscn heaving 
into view 

bessie made no reply true she 
attempted some common-place phrase 
but the words died in her throat she 
turned her head away and thank 
god she was not yet fallen to the 
lowest deep of woman s degradation 
a tear big and scalding came rolling 
down her cheek 

and while mary stood with her 
eyes gazing on the vacant air with 
the manner of one entranced while 
bess pooi and fallen woman 






turned away her face to hide the fain 
ing tear the curtains that concealed 
the entrance to the painted chamber 
were suddenly thrust aside and the 
figure of a man came stealing along 
with a noiseless footstep 

gus lorrimer silent and unper- 
ceived in all the splendor of his 
manly beauty stood gazing upon the 
form of his victim with a glance of 
deep and soul-felt admiration 

his tall form was shown to the ut 
most advantage by a plain suit of 
black cloth a dress coat of the most 
exquisite shape black pantaloons that 
fitted neatly around his well-formea 
limbs a vest of plain white marseilles 
gathering easily across the outlines 
his massive chest a snow-white shirt 
front and a falling collar confined by 
a simple black cravat such were the 
brief details of his neat but effective 
costume his manly face was all in 
a glow with health and excitement 
clustering curls of dark brow hair 
fell carelessly along his open brow 
his clear dark-hazel eye gave forth 
a flashing glance that failed to reveal 
anything but the frank and manly 
qualities of a generous heart you 
did not read the villian in his glance 
the aquiline nose the rounded chin 
the curving lip darkened by a grace 
ful moustache the arching eyebrows 
which gave additional effect to the 
dark eyes all formed the details of a 
countenance that ever struck the be 
holder with its beaming expression of 
health soul and manliness combined 

and as gus lorrimer stood gazing 
in silent admiration upon his victim 
few of his boon companions would 
have recognized in his thoughtful 



the bride 



 



countenance the careless though hand 
some face of the reveller who gave life 
and spirit to their drinking scenes 

the truth is there were two lorri 
mers in owe there was a careless 
dashing hanssome fellow who could 
kill a basket of champagne with any 
body drive the neatest turn out in 
the way of horse flesh that the town 
ever saw carry a frolic so far that 
the watchman would feel bound to 
take it up and carry it a little farther 
this was the magnificent gus lor- 
rimer 

and then there was a tall hand 
some man with a thoughtful counte- 
aance and a deep dark hazel eye 
tfho would sit down by the side of an 
innocent woman and whisper in her 
ear in a low-toned voice for hours to 
gether with an earnestness of manner 
and an intensity of gaze that failed 
in its effect not once in a hundred 
times without any remarkable 
knowledge derived from education 
this man knew every leaf of woman s 
many-leaved heart and knew how 
to apply the revealings which the fair 
book opened to his gaze his gaze 
in some cases in itself was fascina 
tion his low-toned voice in too many 
instances whispered its sentences of 
passion to ears that heard it to their 
eternal sorrow this man threw his 
whole soul in his every passion he 
plead with a woman like a man under 
sentence of death pleading for his life 
is it a wonder that he was but rarely 
unsuccessful this man so deeply 
read in woman s heart was the inner 
man of the handsome fellow with the 
dashing exterior assuming a name 
never spoken to his ear save in the 



soft whispers of one of his many 
victims he styled himself lorraine 
lorrimer 

 oh bessie is not this love 
a strange mystery exclaimed 
mary as though communing with her 
own heart before i loved my soul 
was calm and quiet i had no thought 
beyond my school-books no deeper 
mystery than my embroidery-frame 
now the very air is changed the 
atmosphere in which i breathe is no 
longer the same wherever i move 
his face is before me whatever may 
be my thoughts the thought of him is 
never absent for a moment in my 
dreams i see him smile when 
awake his eyes so deep so burning 
in their gaze even when he is ab 
sent seem forever looking into mine 
oh bessie tell me tell me is it 
given to man to adore his god is it 
not also given to woman to adore the 
one she loves woman s religion is 
her love 

and as the beautiful enthusiast 
whose mind had been developed in 
utter seclusion from the worldgave 
forth these revelations of her heart ir 
broken and abrupt sentences lorri 
mer drew a step nearer and gazec 
upon her with a look in which passion 
rose predominent even above admira- 
ion 

 oh bessie can it be that his love 
will ever grow cold will his voice 
ever lose its tones of gentleness will 
lis gaze ever cease to bind me to him 
as it enchains me now 

 mary whispered a strange voica 
n a low and softened murmur 

sho turned hastily round she beheld 
he arms outspread to receive her she 



 



the merchant s daughter 



saw the manly face of him she loved 
all a-glow with rapture her fair blue 
eyes returned his gaze lorraine 
she murmured in a faint whisper and 
then her head rested upon his bosom 
while her form trembled in his em- 
brace 

 oh lorraine she again mur 
mured as with one fair hand resting 
upon each arm of her lover she gazed 
upward in his face while her blue eyes 
shone with all the feeling of her in 
most soul oh lorraine will 
you love me ever 

mary he answered gazing 
down upon her blushing face as he 
uttered her name in a prolonged whis 
per that gave all its melody of sound to 
her ear mary can you doubt me 

and as there he stood gazing upon 
that youthful face now flushed over 
with an expression of all-trusting love 
as he drank in the glance of her large 
blue eyes and felt her trembling form 
resting gently in his arms the foul 
purpose of his heart was for a mo 
ment forgotten for a moment his 
heart rose swelling within him and 
the thought flashed over his soul that 
for the fair creature who hung fasci 
nated on his every look his life he 
could willingly lay down 

 ha-ha muttered bess who 
stood regarding the pair with a glance 
of doubtful meaning -i really be 
lieve that lorrimer is quite as much 
in love as the poor child good idea 
that a man whose heart has been 
the highway of a thousand loves 
a man like this to fall in love with a 
mere baby-face mary dear she 
continued aloud too happy to break 
the reverie which enchained the se 
ducer anh his vi itim mary dear 



hadn t i better help you to put on yom 
wedding robe 

lorrimer turned and looked at her 
with a sudden scowl of anger in a 
moment his face resumed its smile 

 mary he cried laughingly 
 let me be your costumer for once 
my hands must help you on with the 
wedding robe nay nay you must 
not deny me hand me the dress 
bessie 

it was a splendid robe of the same 
satin as the other part of her dress 
gathering tightly around her form it 
was designed to remain open in front 
while the skirt fell trailing along the 
floor falling aside from the bust 
where outlines were so gracefully de 
veloped by the tight-fitting boddice of 
white satin its opposite sides were con 
nected by interlacing threads of silver- 
cord crossed and recrossed over the 
heaving bosom long and drooping 
sleeves edged with silver lace were 
designed to give bewitching glimpses 
of the maiden s full and rounded arms 
in fine the whole dress was in the 
style of some sixty years since such 
as our grand-dames designated by the 
euphonious name of a gown and 
curricle 

how well the dress becomes you 
mary exclaimed lorrimer with 
a smile as he flung the roue over her 
shoulders how elegant the fall 
of that sleeve ha ha mary 
you must allow me to lace these silver 
cords in front i m afraid i would 
make but an awkward lady s-maid 
what say you bessie mary your 
arms seem to love the light embrace 
of these drooping sleeves you must 
forgive me mary but i thought the 
style of the dress would please you 



the bride 



o i asked our good friend bessie htre 
to have it made by my soul you 
give additional beauty to the wedding 
dress is she not beautiful bessie 

most beautiful exclaimed 
bess as for the moment her gaze of 
unfeigned admiration was fixed upon 
the bride arrayed in the full splen 
dor of her wedding robes most 
beautiful 

mary your hand whispered 
lorrimer to the fair girl who stood 
blushing at his side 

with a heaving bosom and a flash 
ing eye mary slowly reached forth 
her fair and delicate right hand 
lorr mer grasped the trembling fin 
gers within his own and winding his 
unoccupied arm around her waist he 
suffered her head with all its shower 
of glossy tresses to fall gently on his 
shoulders a blush warm and sud 
den came over her face he impress 
ed one long and lingering kiss upon 
her lips they returned the pressure 
and clung to his lips as though they 
had grown there 

mary my own sweet love he 
murmured in a low tone that thrilled 
to her very heart now i kiss you 
as the dearest thing to me in the wide 
world another moment and from 
those same lips will i snatch the first 
kiss of my lovely bride to the 
wedding room my love 

fair and blushing as the dawn 
stainless as the new-fallen snow lov 
ing as one of god s own cherubim he 
led her gently from the place motion 
ing onward with his hand as again 
and again he whispered to the wed 
ding room my love to the wedding 
room 

to the wedding room echo 



ed bess who folllowed in her brides- 
maid robes to the weddmg 
room ha ha ha say rather to 
h 

there was something most solemn 
not to say thoughtful and melancholy 
in the appearance of that lonely room 
it was wide and spacious and warm 
ed by invisible means with heated air 
huge panels of wainscotting covered 
the lofty walls and even the ceiling 
was concealed by massive slabs of 
dark walnut the floor was all one 
polished surface of mahogany desti 
tute of carpet or covering of any kind 
a few high-backed mahogany chairs 
standing along the walls were the only 
furniture of the place the entrance 
to the rose chamber was concealed 
by a dark curtain and in the western 
and northern walls were fashioned 
two massive doors formed like the 
wainscotting of dark and gloomy 
walnut 

in the centre of the glittering ma- 
hogany floor arose a small table 
altar covered with a drooping cloth 
white and stainless as the driven snow 
two massive wax candles placed in 
candlesticks of silver stood on the 
white cloth of the altar imparting a 
dim and dusky light to the room in 
that dim light the sombre panelling of 
the walls and the ceiling the burnish 
ed floor of mahogany as dark as tho 
walnut- wood that concealed the ceil 
ing and the walls looked heavy and 
gloomy as though the place was a 
vault of death instead of a cheerful 
wedding room 

as yet the place was silent and so 
litary the light flickered dim rv 
along the walls and over the mahog- 



the merchant s daughter 



any floor which shone like a rippling 
lake in the moonlight as you gazed 
upon the desolate appearance of that 
place with the solitary wax lights 
burning like two watching souls in 
the centre you would have given the 
world to have seen the room tenanted 
by living beings in its present still 
ness and solitude it looked so much 
like one of those chambers in olden 
story where the ghosts of a departed 
family were wont to assemble once 
a year in order to revive the memo 
ries of their lives on earth 

it might have been three o clock 
or even half an hour later when the 
western door swung slowly open and 
the clergyman who was to solemnize 
this marriage came striding some 
what unsteadily along the floor clad 
in robes of flowing white he had 
borrowed them from the theatre 
with a prayer book in his hand pe- 
triken as he glanced uneasily around 
the room did not look at all unlike 
a minister of a particular class his 
long square lugubrious face slightly 
varied by red streaks around each 
eye was tortured into an expression 
of the deepest solemnity he took 
his position in silence near the altar 

then came the relenting uncle 
striding heavily at the parson s heels 
he was clad in a light blue coat 
with metal buttons a buff vest striped 
trowsers and an enormous scarf 
whose mingled colors of blue and gold 
gathered closely around his short fat 
neck his full-moon face looking 
very much like the face of a relent- 
ng uncle who is willing to bestow 
mercy upon a wild young dog of a 
nephew to almost any extent afford 
ed a pleasing relief to his pear-shaped 



nose which stood out in the light like 
a piece of carved work from a crim 
son wall silently the relenting un 
cle took his position beside the vene 
rable clergyman 

then dressed in solemn black the 
respectedgrand-ma of the bridegroom 
who was in such a fever to see the 
bride came stepping mincingly along 
the floor glancing from side to side 
with an amiable look that ruffled the 
yellowish flesh of her colloped cheeks 

the imperial on her chin had been 
softened down and with the aid of a 
glossy dress of black silk and a tower 
of babel cap she looked quite venera 
ble had it not been for a certain 
twinkle in her eyes you could have 
fallen in her arms and kissed her 
she looked so much like one of those 
dear old souls who make mischief in 
families and distribute tracts and cold 
victuals to the poor the grand-ma 
took her position on the left of the 
clergyman 

and in this position gathered around 
the altar they stood for some fivu 
minutes silently awaiting the appear 
ance af the bridegroom and the bride

 there they are in the next room

no sooner had the words passed his 



lips than lorrimer appeared in the 
small doorway opening into the rose 
chamber and stepped softly along 
the floor of the walnut room mary 
in all her beauty hung on his arm 
her robe of satin wound round her 
limbs and trailed along the floor an 
she walked at her side came long 
haired bess glancing in the faces ot 
the wedding guests with a meaning 
smile 

 nephew i forgive you god 
bless you my dear i approve my 
nephew s choice god bless you my 
dear 

and as though his feelings over 
came him mutchins veiled his face in 
a large red handkerchief beneath 
whose capacious shelter he covertly 
supplied his mouth with a fresh morsel 
of tobacco 

 and is this my grandchild is 
this the dear pet how i shall love 
her shan t i grandson oh my 
precious how do you do 

the clergyman saluted the bridtgt 
with a low bow 

a deep blush came mantling over 
mary s face as she received these 
words of affection and tokens of kind 
ness from the minister and the rela 
tives of her husband while a slight 
yet meaning expression of digust 
flashed over lorrimer s features as he 
observed the manner in which his 
minions and panders performed their 
parts 

with a glance of fire lorrirnei 
motioned the clergyman to proceed 
with the ceremony 

this was the manner of the mar- 
riage 

hand joined in hand lorrimer and 
i mary stood before the altar the 



the merchant s daughter 



bridesmaid stood near the trembling 
bride whispering slight sentences of 
consolation in her ear on the right 
hand of the clergyman stood mutch- 
ins his red round face subdued into 
an expression of the deepest solem 
nity on the other side the vile hag 
of monk-hall with folded arms and 
grinning lips calmly surveyed the 
face of the fair young bride 

in a deep-toned voice petriken be 
gan the sublime marriage ceremony 
of the protestant episcopal church 
there was no hope for the bride now 
trapped decoyed betrayed she was 
about to be offered up a terrible sa 
crifice on that unhallowed altar her 
trembling tones joined with the deep 
voice of lorrimer in every response 
and the marriage ceremony drew 
near its completion there is no 
hope for her now muttered bess 
as her face shone with a glance of 
momentary compassion she is 
sold into the arms of shame 

and at that moment as the bride 
stood in all her beauty before the al 
tar her eyes downcast her long hair 
showering down over her shoulders 
her face warming with blush after 
blush while her voice in low tones 
murmured each trembling response of 
the fatal ceremony at the very mo 
ment when lorrimer gazing upon her 
face with a look of the deepest satis 
faction fancied the fulfilment of the 
maiden s dishonour there shrieked 
from the next chamber a yell of such 
superhuman agony and horror that 
the wedding guests were frozen with 
u sudden awe and transfixed like 
figures of marble to the floor 

the book fell from petriken s trem 



bfing hands mutchins turned pale 
and the old hag started backward 
with sudden horror while bess stood 
as though stricken with the touch of 
death mary poor mary grew white 
as the grave-cloth in the face her 
hand dropped stiffly to her side and 
she felt her heart grow icy within her 
bosom 

lorrimer alone fearless and un 
daunted turned in the direction from 
vhence that fearful yell had shrieked 
and as he turned he started back with 
evident surprise mingled with some 
feelings of horror and alarm 

there striding along the floor 
came the figure of a young man 
whose footsteps trembled as he walk 
ed whose face was livid as the face 
of a corpse whose long black hair 
waved wild and tangled back from 
his pale forehead his eye great 
god it shone as with a gleam 
from the flames of hell 

he moved his trembling lips as he 
came striding on for a moment the 
word he essayed to speak stuck in 
his throat 

at last with a wild movement of his 
arms he shouted in a voice whose 
tones of horror mingled with heart 
rending pathos no man would like 
to hear twice in a life time he shout 
ed a single word 

 mary 

the bride turned slowly round 
her face was pale as death and hei 
blue eyes grew glassy as she turned 
she beheld the form of the intruder 
one glance was enough 

 my brother she shrieked 
and started forward as though aboul 



the bridal 



gt spring in the strangers arms but 
suddenly recoiling she fell heavily 
upon the breast of lorrimer 

there was a moment of silence 
all was hushed as the grave 

the stranger stood silent and mo 
tionless regarding the awe-striken 
bridal party with one settled and 
burning gaze one and all they 
shrank back as if blasted by his look 
even lorrimer turned his head aside 
and held his breath for very awe 

the stranger advanced another step 
and stood gazing in lorrimer s face 

 my sister he cried in a husky 
voice and then as if all further words 
died in his throat his face was con 
vulsed by a spasmodic movement and 
he shook his clenched hand madly in 
the seducer s face 

your name cried lorrimer 
as he laid the fainting form of the 
bride in the arms of long-haired 
bess your name is byrne wood 
this lady is named mary arlington 
there is some mistake here the 
lady is no sister of yours 

 my name said the other with 
a ghastly smile ask this pale-faced 
craven what is my name he intro 
duced me to you this night by my full 
name you at once forgot all but my 
first name my name sir is byrne- 
wood arlington a name sir you 
will have cause to remember in this 
world and devil that you are in 
the next if you harm the slightest hair 
on the head of this innocent girl 

lorrimer started back aghast the 
full horror of his mistake rushed upon 
him and in that moment while the 
fainting girl lay insensible in bessie s 
arms while petriken and mutchbs 
and the haggard old abbess of the 



den stood stncken dumb with astonish 
ment quailing beneath the glance of 
the stranger a long and bony arm 
was thrust from behind the back of 
byrnewood arlington the grim face 
devil-bug shone for a moment in the 
light and then a massive hand with 
talon-fingers fell like a weight upon 
the wick of each candle and the room 
was wrapt in midnight blackness 

then there was a trampling of feet 
to and fro a gleam of light flashed for 
a moment through the passage open 
ing into the rose chamber and then 
all was dark again 

 they are bearing my sister 
away was the thought that flashed 
over the mind of the brother as he 
rushed toward the passage of the rose 
chamber i will rescue her from 
their grasp at the peril of my life 

he rushed along in the darkness 
toward the curtain that concealed the 
entrance into the rose chamber he 
attempted to pass beyond the curtain 
but he was received in the embrace of 
two muscular arms that raised him 
from his feet as though he had been a 
mere child and then dashed him to 
the floor with the impulse of a giant s 
strength 

 ha-ha-ha laughed a hoarse 
voice you don t pass hee mister 
not while bijah s about no you 
don t my feller ha ha ha 

a light devil-bug exclaimed 
a voice that sounded from the centre 
of the darkened room 

in a moment a light grasped in the 
talon -fingers of the doorkeeper of 
monk-hall flashed around the place 
silent and alone gus lorrimer stood 
in the centre of the room his arms 



- 



the merchant s daughter 



folded across his breast while the dark 
frown on his brow was the only out 
ward manifestation of the violence of 
the struggle that had convulsed his 
very soul during that solitary mo 
ment of utter darkness calling all 
the resources of his mind to his aid 
he had resolved upon his course of 
action 

 is a fearful remedy but a sure 
one he muttered as he again faced 
byrnewood who had just risen from 
the floor where he had been thrown 
by mr abijah k jones begone 
devil-bug he continued aloud 
but wait without and see that glow 
worm and musquito are at hand he 
added in a meaning whisper now 
sir i have a word to say to you 
and as he spoke he confronted the 
brother of the girl whose ruin he had 
contrived with the ingenuity of an 
accomplished libertine mingled with 
ail the craft of an incarnate fiend 

aching in every limb from his re 
cent fall byrnewood stood pale and 
silent regarding the libertine with a 
settled gaze in the effort to command 
his feelings he pressed his teeth against 
his lower lip until a thin line of blood 
trickled down to his chin 

you will allow that this is a most 
peculiar case he exclaimed with 
a calm gaze as he confronted byrne- 
wood one in fact that demands 
some painful thought will you favor 
me with ten minutes private conversa 
tion 

you are very polite exclaimed 
byrnewood with a withering sneer 
here is a man who commits a wrong 
for which h itself has no name 
and then instead of shrinking from 
the sight of the man he has injured 



beyond the power of vords o tell ha 
cooly demands ten minutes private 
conversation 

it is your interest to grant my re 
quest replied lorrimer with a 
manner as collected as though he had 
merely said pass the bottle byrne- 
wood 

i presume must submit re 
plied byrnewood but after the ten 
minutes are past remember that 
there is not a fiend in hell whom i 
would not sooner hug to my bosom 
than grant one moment s conversation 
to a a man ha ha a man 
like you my sister s honor may be 
in your power but remember that 
as surely as you wrong her so surely 
you will pay for that wrong with 
your life 

you then grant me ten minutes 
conversation you give me your 
word that during this period you will 
eep your seat and listen patiently to 
all that i may have to say you nod 
assent follow me then a footstep 
or so this way will lead us to a plea 
sant room the last of this range 
where we can talk the matter over 

he flung open the western door of 
he walnut room and led the way 
ilong a narrow entry up a stairway 
with some five steps and in a moment 
stood before a small doorway closing 
he passage at the head of the stairs 
at every footstep of the way he held 
he light extended at arms length and 
regarded byrnewood with the cautious 
lance of a man who is not certain 
at what moment a concealed enemy 
may strike him in the back 

my library sir exclaimed 
lorrimer as pushing open the door he 
entered a small oblong roorr some 



the bridal 



wenty-feet in length and about half 
hat extent in width a quiet little 
place where i sometimes amuse my 
self with a book there is a chair 
sir please be seated 

seating himself upon a small stool 
that stood near the wall of the room 
furthest from the door byrnewood 
with a single glance took in all the 
details of the place it was a small 
unpretending room oblong in form 
with rows of shelves along its longest 
walls facing each other supplied with 
books of all classes and of every des 
cription from the pondrous history to 
the trashy novel the other walls at 
either end were concealed by plain 
and neat paper of a modern pattern 
which by no means harmonized with 
the ancient style of the carpet whose 
half-faded colors glowed dimly in the 
light along the wall of the chamber 
opposite byrnewood extended an old- 
fashioned sofa wide and roomy as a 
small sleeping couch and from the 
centre of the place arose a massive 
table fashioned like a chest with sub 
stantial sides of carved oak supply 
ing the place of legs to all appear 
ance it was fixed and jointed into the 
floor of the room 

altogether the entire room as its 
details were dimly revealed by the 
beams of the flickering lamp wore a 
cheerless and desolate look increased 
by the absence of windows from the 
walls and the ancient and worn-out 
appearance which characterized the 
stool the sofa and the table the only 
furniture of the place there was no 
visible hearth and no sign of fire 
while the ir cold and chilling had a 
tiusty and unwholesome taint as 



though the room had not been visited 
or opened for years 

placing the lamp on the solitary ta 
ble lorrimer flung himself carelessly 
on the sofa and motioned byrnewood 
to draw his seat nearer to the light 
as byrnewood seated himself beside 
the chest-like table with his cheek 
resting on his hand the full details of 
his countenance so pale so colorless 
so corpse-like were disclosed to the 
keen gaze of lorrimer the face of 
the brother was perfectly calm al 
though the large black eyes dilated 
with a glance that revealed the soul 
turning madly on itself and gnawing 
its own life in very madness of 
thought while from the lips tightly 
compressed there still trickled down 
the same thin line of blood ren 
dered even more crimson and dis 
tinct by the extreme pallor of the 
countenance 

 you will at least admit that 
have won the wager said lorri 
mer in a meaning tone as he fixed 
his gaze upon the death-like counte 
nance of byrnewood arlington 

byrnewood started raised his hands 
suddenly as if about to grasp the liber 
tine by the throat and then folding his 
arms tightly over his chest he ex 
claimed in a voice marked by unatural 
calmness 

 for ten minutes sir i have pro 
mised to listen to all all you may 
have to say go on sir but do not 
i beseech you tempt me too far 

 exactly half-past three by my re 
peater cooly replied lorrimer 
looking at his watch at twenty 
minutes of four our conversations ends 
very good now sir listen to my 



the merchant s daughter 



proposition give me your word of 
honor and your oath that when you 
leave this house you will preserve the 
most positive secrecy with regard to 
to everything you may have 
witnessed within its walls promise 
me this under your word of honor and 
your solemn oath and i will give you 
my word of honor my oath that in 
one hour from daybreak your sister 
shall be taken to her home pure and 
stainless as when first she left her fa 



ther s threshold 
this 



do you agree to 



 do you see this hand answered 
byrnewood with a nervous tremour 
of- his lips that imparted an almost 
savage sneer to his countenance 
 do you see this flame sooner than 
 agree to leave these walls without 
m y m y without mary pure and 
stainless mark ye would hold this 
good right hand in the blaze of this 
lamp until the flesh fell blackened and 
festering from the very bohe are 
you answered 

 excuse me sir i was not speak 
ing of any anatomical experiments 
however interesting such little efforts 
in the surgical line may be to you i 
wished to make a compromise 

 a compromise echoed byrne- 
wood 

 yes a compromise that melo 
dramatic sneer becomes you well but 
it would suit the pantomimist at the 
walnut street theatre much better 
what have i done with the girl that you 
or any other young blood about town 
would not do under similar circum 
stances who was it that entered 
so heartily into the joke of the sham 



marriage when 
oyster cellar 



it was named in the 
who was it called 



the 



astrologer a 



knave a foruiiw 



 



teller a catch-penny cheat when 
he simple man advised me to 
give up the girl i perceive sir you 
are touched i am glad to observe 
tbat you appreciate the graphic truth 
of my remarks you will not sneer 
at the word compromise again will 
you 

oh mary oh mary whisper 
ed byrnewood drawing his arms yet 
more closely over his breast as though 
in the effort to command his agitation 
 mary was i placing your honor 
in the dice-box when i made the 
wager with yonder man was it 
your ruin the astrologer foretold when 
he urged this devil to turn back in 
his career was it my voice that 
cheered him onward in his work of 
infamy oh mary was it for this 
for this that i loved you as brothei 
never loved sister was it for this 
that i wound you close to my inmost 
heart since first i could think or feel 
was it for this that in the holiest of 
all my memories all my hopes your 
name was enshrined was it for this 
that i pictured again and again every 
hour in the day every moment of the 
night the unclouded prospects of your 
future life oh mary oh mary i 
may be wrong i may be vile i may 
be sunken as low as the man before 
me yet my love for you has been 
without spot and without limit and 
now mary oh now 

he paused there was a husky 
sound in his throat and the blood 
trickled faster from his tortured lip 

lorrimer looked at him silently for 
a moment and then taking a small 
pen-kriife from his pocket began to 
pare iis nails with a quiet and absen 



the bridal 



 



air as though he did nt exactly know 
what to do with himself he wore 
the careless and easy look of a gentle 
man who having just dined is 
wondering where in the deuce he shall 
spend the afternoon 

j i say byrnie my boy he cried 
suddenly with his eyes fixed on the 
operations of the knife devilish 
odd ain t it that little affair of 
yours with annie wonder if she 
has any brother keen cut that 

had mr lorrimer intended the allu 
sion about the keenness of the cut 
for byrnewood instead of his nail-par 
ing knife the remark would perhaps 
have been equally applicable byrne- 
wood shivered at the name of annie 
as though an ague-fit had passed sud 
denly over him the cut was rather 
keen and somewhat deep this care 
less kind of intellectual surgery some 
times makes ghastly wounds in the 
soul which it s pleasantly dissects 

 may i ask what will be your 
course in case you leave this place 
without the lady you are silent i 
suppose there will be a suit instituted 
for abduction and a thousand legal 
et ceteras this place will be ransack 
ed for the girl and your humble ser 
vant will be threatened with the peni 
tentiary a pleasant prospect truly 
why do you look so earnestly at that 
hand 

 you have your pleasant prospects 
i have mine exclaimed byrne- 
wood with a convulsive smile you 
see that right hand do you i was 
just thinking how long it might be 
ere that hand would be reddened with 
your heart s blood 

poh poh such talk is d d 



boyish ivye agree to my proposition 
yes or no 

 you have had my answer 

 in case i surrender the girl to you 
will you then promise unbroken se 
crecy with regaifd to the events of 
this night 

 i will make no terms whatever 
with a scoundrel and a coward 
hissed byrnewood between his clench 
ed teeth 

 pshaw it is high time this mask 
should be cast aside exclaimed 
lorrimer as his eye flashed with an 
expression of triumph mingled with 
anger and scorn and do you sup 
pose that on any condition or for any 
consideration i would leave this fair 
prize slip from my grasp why in 
nocent that you are you might have 
piled oath on oath until your very 
breath grew husky in the effort and 
still still despite of all your oaths 
the girl would remain mine 

know me as i am not the mere 
man-about-town not the wine-drink 
ing companion not the fashionable 
addle-head you think me but the 
man of pleasure you will please 
observe how much lies concealed in 
that title you have talents these 
talents have been from childhood de 
voted to books or mercantile pursuits 
i have some talent i flatter myself 
and that talent aided and strengthened 
in all its efforts by wealth from very 
boyhood has been devoted to pleasure 
which in plain english means 
woman 

woman the means ot securing 
her affection of compassing her ruin 
of enjoying her beauty has been my 
book my study my science nay my 



the merchant s daughter 



profession from boyhood and am i 
to be foiled in one of the most intricate 
of all my adventures by such a 
child a mere boy like you are 
you to frighten me to scare me back 
in the path i have chosen to wrest 
this flower to obtain which i have 
perilled so much are you to wrest this 
flower from my grasp you are so 
strong so mighty you talk of redden 
ing your hand in my heart s blood 
and all such silly vaporing that would 
be hissed by the pit-boy s if they but 
heard it spouted forth by a fifth-rate 
hero of the green-room and yet 
with all this you are my prisoner 

your prisoner echoed byrne- 
wood slowly rising to his feet 

keep cool sir cried lorrimer 
with a glance of scorn two mi 
nutes of the ten yet remain i have 
your word of honor you will remem- 
oer yes my prisoner why 
do you suppose for a moment that i 
would let you go forth from this house 
when you have it in your power to 
raise the whole city on my head 
you know that have placed myself 
under the ban of the laws by this ad 
venture you know that the peniten 
tiary would open its doors to enclose 
me in case i was to be tried for this 
affair you know that popular indig 
nation poverty and disgrace stare rne 
in the very eyes the moment this ad 
venture is published to the world and 
yet ha ha ha you still think me 
the egregious ass to open the doors 
of monk-hall to you and pleasantly 
bid you go forth and ruin rne forever 
sir you are my prisoner 

ha ha ha i will be even 
with you laughed byrne wood 



you may murder me in the aft oul 
i still have the power to arouse tho 
neighbourhood i can shriek for help 
i can yell out the cry of murder from 
this foul den until your doors are flung 
open by the policeand the secrets of your 
rookery laid bare to the public gaze 

scream yell cry out until your 
throat cracks who will hear you 
do you know how many feet you are 
standing above the level of the earth 
do you know the thickness of these 
walls do you know that you stand 
in the tower-room of monk-hall 
try your voice by all means i 
should like to hear you cry murder or 
fire or even hurra for some political 
candidate if the humor takes you 

byrnewood sank slowly in his seat 
and rested his cheek upon his hand 
his face was even paler than before 
the consciousness that he was in the 
power of this libertine for life or death 
or any act of outrage came stealing 
round his heart like the probings of 
a surgeon s knife 

go on sir he muttered biting 
his nether lip until the blood once 
more came trickling down to his 
chin the hour is yours mine 
will come 

at my bidding not a moment 
sooner laughed lorrimer rising 
his feet why man death sur 
rounds you in a thousand forms 
and you know it not you may walk on 
death you may breathe it you may 
drink it you may draw it to you with 
a fingers-touch and yet be as uncon 
scious of its presence as a blind man 
is of a shadow in the night 

byrnewood slowly rose from his 
seat he clasped his hands nervously 



the bridal 



 



together and his lips muttered an in 
coherent sound as he endeavoured to 
spea k 

 lt do what you will with me he 
cried in a husky voice but oh for 
the sake of god do not wrong my 
mter 

 she is in my power whispered 
lorrimer with a smile as he gazed 
apon the agitated countenance of the 
brother she is in my power 

 then by the eternal god you are 
in mine shrieked byrnewood as 
with one wild bound he sprang at the 
tall form of lorrimer and fixed both 
hands around his throat with a grasp 
like that of the tigress when she fights 
for her young you are in my 
power you cannot unloose my grasp 
ha ha you grow black in the 
face struggle struggle with 
all your strength you cannot tear my 
hands from your throat you shall 
die like a felon by the eternal god 

lorrimer was taken by complete 
surprise the wild bound of byrne- 
wood had been so sudden the grasp 
of his hands was so much like the 
terrific clutch with which the drown 
ing man makes a last struggle for life 
that for a single moment the hand 
some gus lorrimer reeled to and fro 
like a drunken man while his manly 
features darkened over with a hue of 
livid blackness as ghastly as it was 
instantaneous the struggle lasted 
but a single moment with the con 
vulsive grasp tightening around his 
throat lorrimer sank suddenly on 
one knee dragging his antagonist with 
him and as he sank extending his 
arm with an effort as desperate as that 
which fixed the clinched fingers 



around his throat he struck byrne- 
wood a violent blow with his fist di 
rectly behind the ear byrnewood 
sank senseless to the floor his fingers 
unclosing their grasp of lorrimer s 
throat as slowly and stiffly as though 
they were seized with a sudden cramp 

 pretty devilish and d d hasty 
muttered lorrimer arranging his cra 
vat and vest left the marks of his 
fingers on my throat i ll be bound 
hallo musquito hallo glow-worm 
here s work for you 

the door of the room swung sud 
denly open and the herculean negroes 
stood in the doorway their sable faces 
agitated by the same hideous grin 
while the sleeves of the red flannel 
shirts which formed their common 
costume rolled up to the shoulders 
disclosed the iron-sinews of their jet- 
black arms 

 mark this man i say 

 yes massa i doo-es 
chuckled musquito as his loathsome 
lips inclining suddenly downward to 
ward the jaw on either side of his 
face were convulsed by a brutal grin 
 dis nigger nebber mark a man 
yet but dat somein cum ob it 

 massa gusty no want de critter to 
go out ob dis ere door exclaimed 
glow-worm as the long rows of his 
teeth bristling from his thick lips

no mash him head bad ain t glow

did you ebber see dis chile child

all night exclaimed lorrimer as 



the merchant s daughter 



he stood upon the threshold let 
him not leave the room on the peril of 
your lives d ye mark me fellows 

and as he spoke motioning the ne 
groes from the room he closed the 
door and disappeared 

he had not gone a moment when 
byrnewood recovering from the stun 
ning effect of the blow which had saved 
lorrimer s life slowly staggered to 
his feet and gazed around with a be 
wildered glance 

 on christmas eve he mur 
mured wildly as though repeating 
words whispered to his ear in a dream 
 on christmas eve at the hour 
of sundown one of ye will die by the 
other s hand the winding sheet is 
woven and the coffin made 



chapter eleventh

are 

the light from the blazing coal -fire 
streamed around the doorkeeper s 
den seated close by the grate in a 
crouching attitude his feet drawn to 
gether his big hands grasping each 
knee with a convulsive clutch his 
head lowered on his breast and his 
face warmed to a crimson red by the 



devil-bug 



glare of the flame moistened with 
thick drops of perspiration devil- 
bug turned the orbless eye-socket to 
the floor at his left side as though it 
was gifted with full powers of sight 
while his solitary eye grew larger and 
more burning in its fixed gaze uutil 
at last it seemed to stand out from 
his overhanging brow like a separate 
flame 

the agitation of the man was at 
once singular and fearful oozing from 
his swarthy brow the thick drops of 
sweat fell trickling over his hideous 
face moistening his matted hair until 
it hung damp and heavy over his 
eyebrows the lips of his wide mouth 
receding to his flat nose and pointed 
chin disclosed the long rows of brist 
ling teeth fixed as closely together as 
though the man had been suddenly 
seized with lock-jaw his face was 
all one loathsome grimace as with his 
blazing eye fixed upon the fire he 
seemed gazing upon the floor at his 
left with the shrunken and eyeless 
socket of the other side of his face 

this creature who sate crouching 
in the light of the fire muttering 
words of strange meaning to himself 
presented a fearful study for the chris 
tian and philanthropist his soul 
was like his body a mass of hideous 
and distorted energy 
 born in a brothel the offspring of 
foulest sin and pollution he had grown 
from very childhood in full and con 
tinual sight of scenes of vice wretch 
edness and squalor 

from his very birth he had breath 
ed an atmosphere of infamy 

to him there was no such thing as 
good in the world 



his world his place of birth his 
home in infancy childhood and man 
hood his only theaie of action 
had been the common house of ill-fame 
no mother had ever spoken words of 
kindness to him no father had evei 
held him in his arms sister brother 
friends he had none of these he 
had come into the world without u 
name his present one being the stand 
ing designation of the successiye door 
keepers of monk-hall which he in vain 
endeavoured to assume leaving the 
slang title bestowed on him in child 
hood to die in forgetfulness 

abijah k jones he might call him 
self but he was devil-bug still 

his loathsome look his distorted 
form and hideous soul all seemed to 
crowd on his memory at the same mo 
ment when the word devil-bug rang 
on his ear that word uttered and he 
stood apart from the human race that 
word spoken and he seemed to feel 
that he was something distinct from the 
mass of men a wild beast a snake 
reptile or a devil incarnate any 
thing but a man 

the same instinctive pleasure that 
other men may feel in acts of benevo 
lence of compassion or love warmed 
the breast of devil-bug when enjoyed 
in any deed marked by especial cru 
elty this word will scarcely express 
the instinctive impulse of his soul 
he loved not so much to kill as to ob 
serve the blood of his victim fall drop 
by drop as to note the convulsive look 
of death as to hear the last throttling 
rattle in the throat of the dying 

for years and years the instinctive 
impulse had worked in his own bosom 
without vent the murder which had 
dyed his hands with human blood for 



the merchant s daughter 



i he first time some six years ago 
opened wide to his soul tne pathway of 
crime which it was his doom and his de- 
 ight to tread ever since the night of the 
murder his victim hideous and repul 
sive had lain beside him crushed and 
mangled as he fell through the death 
trap the corpse was never absent 
from his fancy which in this instance 
had assumed the place of eyesight did 
he s it it was at his left side did 
he walk crushed and mangled as it 
was it glided with him did he 
sleep it still was at his side ever 
present with him always staring him 
in the face with all its loathsome de 
tails of horror and bloodshed 

since the night of the murder a 
longing desire had grown up within 
this creature to lay another corpse be 
side his solitary victim were there 
he thought two corses ever at his 
side the terrible details of the man 
gled form and crushed countenance of 
the first would loose half their horror 
all their distinctness he longed to 
surround himself with the phantoms 
of new victims in the number of his 
crimes he even anticipated pleasure 

it was this man this deplorable mo 
ral monstrosity who knew no god 
who feared no devil whose existence 
was one instinctive impulse of cruelty 
and bloodshed it was this outlaw of 
heaven and earth and hell who held 
the life of byrne wood arlington in 
his grasp 

it s near about mornin and that 
ere boy ought to have somethin to eat 
 leetle to drink per aps now 
p-pose i should take him up e 
hiled chicken and a bottle o wine 



he sits down by the table o course to

man s voice and the queenly form of 
long haired bess with a dark shawl 
thrown over her bridesmaid s dress ad 
vanced toward the light i ve just 
left lorrimer he s with the girl you

you to keep close watch on that young 
fellow

voice always a-orderin a feller 
about that s his way spose you 
cant make yourself useful kin you 
then take some biled chicken and 
a bottle o wine up to the younk chap

face that way fur no you shant git 
em git em mesself wait here 
till i come back do nt let any one 
in without the pass word what 
hour of the night and the answer 
dinner time you know 

and as devil-bug strode heavily 
from the den and was heard going 
down into the cellars of the mansion 



devil-bug 



bess stood silent and erect before the 
fire her face shadowed by an expres 
sion of painful thought while her 
dark eyes shot a wild glance from be 
neath her arching brows suddenly 
compressed in a frown 

 some mischief at work i sup 
pose s he whispered in a hissing 
vo j ce i ve sold myself to shame 
but not to murder 

a low knock resounded from the 
front door 

suddenly undrawing the bolt and 
flinging the chain aside bess gazed 
through a crevice of the opened door 
upon the new-comers who stood be 
yond the out-side door of green -blinds 

who s there she said in a low 
voice 

ha ha laughed one of the 
strangers it s bonny bess what 
hour of the night is it my dear 

 dinner time you fool re 
plied the young lady opening the out 
side door come in luke ha 
there is a stranger with you your 
friend luke 

 aye aye bessie my love an 
swered luke as he entered the den 
with the stranger at his side did 
ye hear the devil-bug say whether 
there was fire in my room all right 
hey and cards you know bess 
cards this gentleman and t want 
to amuse ourselves with a little game 
bye-the-bye where s fitz-cowles 
i should like him to join us seen 
him to night my dear 

 up stairs you know luke an- 
veed bess with a meaning smile 
veiled figure luke you know 
that s a game above your fancy i 
should suppose 

and as she said this with an ex 



pressive gance of her dark eye bess 
observed that the stranger who ac 
companied luke was a very tall stout 
man wrapped up in a thick overcoat 
whose upraised collar concealed his 
face to the very eyes his eyes were 
visible for a single moment how- 
ever as half-hidden by the shadow of 
luke s figure the stranger strode 
swiftly across the floor of the den 
bess started with a feeling of terror 
akin to the awe one experiences in the 
presence of a madman as those eyes 
so calm and yet so burning in their 
fixed gaze flashed for a moment in 
the red light 

luke i am ready said the 
stranger in a smothered voice to 
the room luke to the room 

without a word luke led the way 
from the den and in a moment bess 
heard the half-hushed sound of their 
footsteps as they ascended the stair- 
case of the mansion 

that s a strange eye for a man 
who s only a-goin to play cards 
muttered bess as she stood by the fire 
place now it s more like the eye of 
a man who s been playin all night 
and lost his very soul in a game with 
the d lord but that s a wick- 
ed eye for a dark night 

here s the biled chicken and the 
wine grated the harsh voice of 
devil-bug who approached the fire 
with a large waiter in his arms 
take it up to the feller bess he s 
hungry praps and d ye mind gal- 
set his plate on the side of the table 
furthest from the door 

any particular reason for that 
bijah 

 cuss it gal cant you do it with 
out axeing questions it s only n 



the merchant s daughter 



whim o mine that bottle is worth 
its weight in red goold don t taste 
such madeery every day i tell you 
p oor fellow guess he s a-most 
starved 

well well i ll take him the chick- 
en and the wine exclaimed bess 
pleasantly as she took possession of 
the waiter with its cold chicken and 
luscious wine hang it though 
when i come to think o it why could nt 
you have taken it up yourself bijah 
you re growin lazy 

mind gal grunted devil-bug 
as the girl disappeared through the 
door set his plate on the side of 
the table furthest from the door d ye 
hear it s a whim o mine furthest 
from the door d ye hear 

 furthest from the door echoed 
bess and in a moment her footsteps 
resounded with a low pattering noise 
along the massive staircase 

the spring and the bottle 
muttered devil-bug as he resumed his 
seat beside the fire it seems to 
me i should like to creep up stairs 
and listen at his door to see how them 
things work the niggers is there 
but no matter may be he ll howl 
or groan or do all sorts of ravin s 
gusty did not exactly tell me to do all 
this but i guess he ll grin as wide 
as any body when the thing is done 
it seems to me i should like to see 
how them things works it ud be nice 
to listen a bit at his door wonder if 
that gal suspicions anything 

he rubbed his hands earnestly to 
gether as a man is want to do under 
the influence of some pleasing idea 
and his solitary eye dilated and spark 
led with a glance of the most remark 



able satisfaction a slight cmicklt 
shook his distorted frame and his lips 
performed a succession of vivid spasms 
which an ignorant observer might 
have confounded under the general 
name of laughter 

poor feller guess he s cold with 
out a -fire said complacent devil- 
bug as he rubbed his hand cheerfully 
together i might build him a little 
fire i might i might ha ha 
ha he arose slowly to his feet and 
laughed so loud that the echoes of his 
voice resounded from the den along 
the hall and up the staircase of the 
mansion i might try that he cried 
with a hideous glow of exultation- 
wonder how that would ivork 

opening the door of a closet on one 
side of the fire-place he drew from its 
depths a small furnace of iron such 
as housewives use for domestic pur 
poses he placed the furnace in the 
full light of the fire surveyed it close 
ly rubbed his hands pleasantly toge 
ther yet once more while a deep 
chuckle shook his form from head to 
foot his face wore an expression of 
extreme good humor the visage of 
a drunken loafer as he flings a penny 
to a ragged sweep was nothing in 
comparison 

a leetle kindlin wood he 
muttered drawing to the fire an old 
sack that had lain concealed in the 
darkness and a leetle charcoal 
makes a rougeing hot fire fat pine 
and charcoal ha ha ha rather 
guess the poor fellow s cold now 
for a light cuss it how the fat pin 
blazes 

he waited but a single moment foi 
the wood and charcoal to ignite it 



devil-bug 



flared up at first in a smoky blaze and 
then subsided into a clear and brillian 
flame seizing the iron handle of the 
furnace devil-bug suddenly raised it 
from the floor and rushed from the 
den and up the staircase of the man 
sion as though his very life hung on 
his speed and as he ascended the 
stairway the light of the furnace 
gradually increasing to a vivid flame 
was thrown upward over his hideous 
face turning the beetling brow the 
flat nose and the wide mouth with its 
bristling teeth to a hue of dusky red 
one moment as he swung the furnace 
from side to side you beheld his face 
and form in a glow of blood red light 
and the next it was suddenly lost to 
view while the vessel of iron with its 
burning coals seemed gliding up the 
stairway impelled by a single swarthy 
hand with fingers like talons and 
sinews starting out from the skin like 
knotted cords 

halloo i didn t know monk 
luke was in his room he mutter 
ed as he paused for a moment before 
a massive door opening into the hall 
which extended along the mansion 
above the first stairway there s a 
streak of light from the keyhole of his 
door and voices inside the room 
but no matter the charcoal s a-burn- 
m and wonder how that ill 
work 

and up the staircase of the mansion 
he pursued his way flinging the blaz 
ing furnace from side to side while his 
face grew like the visage of a very 
devil as again the words rose to his 
ips 

 the charcoal s a-burnin won- 
cier how ma ill work 



the light still flickered through the 
keyhole cf the massive door 

within the sombre panels it shone 
over the rich furniture of an apart 
ment long and wide with high 
ceiling and wainscotted walls the 
was a gorgeous carpet on the floor a 
thickly curtained bed in one corner a 
comfortable fire burning in the grate 
and a large table standing near the 
centre of the room on which a plain 
lamp darkened by a heavy shade was 
burning the shade flung the light 
of the lamp down over the table it 
was covered with books cards and 
wine glasses and around the carpet 
for the space of a yard or more while 
the other portions of the apartment 
were enveloped in faint twilight 

and in that dim light near the fire 
stood two men steadfastly regarding 
each other in the face the snake- 
like eye of the tall and slender man 
was fixed in keen gaze upon the bronzed 
face of his companion whose stout 
and imposing form seemed yet more 
large and commanding in its propor 
tions as occasional flashes from the 
fire-place lighted up the dim twilight 
t was a strange thing to see those 
arge blue eyes gleaming from the 
bronzed face with such a calm and 
yet burning lustre 

 luke to the the room 
whispered a roice husky with sup 
pressed agitation 

he is calm muttered luke to 
himself i led him a d of a vay 
n order to give him time to command 
lis feelings he is calm now and 
it s too late to go back 

extending his hand he reached a 
small dark lanthern from the mantel 



the merchant s daughter 



piece and walked softly across the 
floor opening the door of a wide 
closet he motioned livingstone to 
approach 

 you see this is rather a spacious 
closet luke whispered as silently 
drawing livingstone within the recess 
he closed the door leaving them en 
veloped in thick darkness the 
back wall of the closet is nothing less 
han a portion of the wainscotting of 
the next room give me your hand 

it is firm by g d do you feel 
that bolt it s a little one but once 
withdrawn the panelling swings 
away from the closet like a door and 

egad the next room lays before 
you 

while livingstone stood in the thick 
darkness of the closet silent as death 
luke slowly drew the bolt another 
touch and the door would swing open 
into the next room luke could hear 
the hard breathing of the merchant 
and the hand which he touched sud 
denly became cold as ice 

as though by mere accident in that 
moment of suspense when their joined 
fingers touched the bolt harvey al 
lowed the door of the dark lanthern i 
to spring suddenly open the face 
of livingstone every line and feature 
was disclosed in the light with appal- 
ing distinctness luke was prepared 
for a sight of some interest but no 
sooner did the light fall on the mer 
chant s face than he gave a start of 
involuntary horror it was as though 
the face of a corpse suddenly recalled 
to life had risen before him white 
and livid and ghastly with the dis 
colored circles of flesh deepening be 
neath each eye and with the large 
blue eyes steadily glaring from the 



 dark eyebrows it was countenance 
to strike the very heart with fear and 
horror the firm lips wore a blueish 
hue as though the man had been dead 
for days and corruption was eating 
its way through his vitals around 
his high and massive brow hung his 
hair in slight masses fearful streaks 
of white resting like scattered ashes 
among the locks of dark brown 

well luke you see i am 
calm whispered livingstone smil 
ing with his lips still compressed 
 i am calm 

luke slowly withdrew the bolt and 
closed the door of the lanthern the 
secret door of the wainscotting swung 
open with a faint noise 

 listen he whispered to living 
stone as the dark room lay before 
them listen 

and with his very breath hushed 
livingstone silently listened a low 
sound like a woman breathing in her 
sleep came faintly to his ear luke 
felt the merchant start as though he 
was reeling beneath a sudden blow 

 give me the dark lanthern 
whispered livingstone the pistols 
i have he continued hissing the 
words through his clinched teeth 
 the room is dark but i can discern 
the outlines of the bed 

he pressed luke by the hand with 
a firm grasp took the lanthern care 
fully closing its door and strode with 
a noiseless footsiep into the dark 
room 

luke remained in the closet listen 
ing with hushed breath 

there was a pause for a moment 

it seemed an age to the listener not 

j a sound not a footstep not even the 

i rustling of the bed-curtains all was 



the tower room 



silent as the grave- vault which has 
riot been disturbed for years 

luke listened he leaned from 
 he closet and gazed into the dark 
room it was indeed dark not the 
outline of a chair or a sofa or the 
slightest piece of furniture could he 
discern true near the centre of the 
place arose a towering object whose 
outlines seemed a shade lighter than 
the rest of the room this might be 
the bed thought luke and again 
holding his breath he listened for the 
slightest sound 

all was dark and still 

presently luke heard a low gur 
gling noise like the sound produced 
by a drowning man then all was 
silent as before 

in a moment the gurgling noise was 
heard again and a sudden blaze of 
light streamed around the room 



chapter twelfth 

the tower room 

 my sister is in his power for any 
act of wrong for any deed of outrage 
and i cannot strike a blow in her de 
fence a solitary wall may separate 
as in one room the sister pleads with 
the villain for mercy in the other 
trapped and imprisoned the brother 
hears her cry of agony and cannot 
cannot raise a finger in her behalf 
ha the door is fast i hear the 
hushed breathing of negroes on the 
lt other side i have read many legends 
 of a place of torment in the other 
world but what devil could contrive a 
hell like this 



he flung himself on the sofa and 
covered his face with his hands the 
lamp burning dimly on the solitary 
table flung a faint and dusky light 
around the walls of the tower room 
byrnewood lay in dim shadow 
with his limbs thrown carelessly along 
the sofa his outspread hands covering 
his face while the long curls of his 
raven-black hair fell wild and tangled 
over his forehead as he lay there 
with his dress disordered and his form 
resting on the sofa in an attitude 
which careless as it was resembled 
the crouching position of one who suf 
fers from the cold chill succeeding 
fever you might have taken him for 
an inanimate effigy instead of a liv 
ing and breathing man 

no heaving of the chest no quick 
and gasping respiration no convulsive 
movements of the fingers indicated 
the agitation which shook his soul to 
its centre he lay quiet and motion 
less his white hands concealing his 
livid face while a single glimpse of 
his forehead was visible between the 
tangled locks of his raven hair 

the silence of the room was broken 
by the creaking of the door as it 
swung slowly open 

bess silently entered the room hold 
ing the waiter with the cold chicken 
and bottle of madeira in her hands 
she hurriedly closed the door and ad 
vanced to the solitary table her face 
was very pale and her long dark 
hair hung in disordered tresses around 
her full voluptuous neck the dark 
shawl which she had thrown over her 
bridesmaid s dress had fallen from her 
shoulders and hung loosely from ner 
arms as she walked her entire ap 
pearance betrayed agitation and hast

 he sleeps she murmured ar 
ranging the refreshments provided 
by devil-bug along the surface of 
the chest-like table fix his plate 
on the side of the table furthest from 
the door what could the monster 
mean ha there may be a secret 
spring on that side of the table which 
the foot of the victim is designed to 
touch i ll warn him of his danger 
and then the bottle 

she said she would warn byrne- 
wood of his danger and yet she linger 
ed about the small table her confused 
and hurried manner betraying her ir 
resolution and changeability of pur 
pose byrnewood still lay silent and 
motionless on the sofa as far from 
slumber as the victim writhing on the 
rack he was still unconscious of the 
presence of long-haired bess his 
mind was utterly absorbed in the har 
rowing details of the mental struggle 
that shook his soul to its foundations 

at first arranging the knife and 
plate on one side of the table and then 
on the other now placing the bottle in 
one position and again in another it 
was evident that long-haired bess 
was absent confused and deeply agi 
tated the side-long glance which 
every other instant she threw over 
her shoulder at the reclining form of 
byrnewood was fraught with deep 
and painful meaning at last with a 
hurried footstep she approached the 
sofa and glancing cautiously at the 
door which hung slightly ajar she 
laid her hand lightly on byrnewood s 
shoulder 

 i come to warn you of your 
danger she whispered in his 
ear 

byrnewood looked up in wonder 



and then an expression of intolerab e 
disgust impressed every line of his 
countenance 

 your touch is pollution he 
said shaking her hand from his 
shoulder you were one of the 
minions of the villain you plotted 
my sister s dishonor 

 i come to warn you of your 
danger whispered bess with a 
flashing eye you behold refresh 
ments spread for you on yonder table 
you see the bottle o wine on peril 
of your life don t drink anything 

but rale good brandy grated 
a harsh voice at her shoulder 
 liqu-ood hell-fire for ever that s 
the stuff my feller ha ha ha s 

with the same start of surprise 
byrnewood sprang to his feet and 
bess turned hurriedly around while 
their eyes were fixed upon the face of 
the new-comer 

devil-bug hideous and grinning 
with the furnace of burning coals in 
his hand stood before them his 
solitary eye rested upon the face of 
long-haired bess with a meaning look 
and his visage passed through the series 
of spasmodic contortions peculiar to hs 
expressive features as he stood swing 
ing the furnace from side to side 

 you can go bessie my duck 
he said with a pleasant way of speak 
ing original with himself this 
ere party don t want you no more 
you see my feller citizen he con 
tinued turning to byrnewood yer 
humble servant thought you might be 
hungry so he sent you suffin to eat 
thought you might be cold so he 
brung you some coals to warm yes- 
self you can re-tire bessie 

he gently led her to the door fix- 



the tt vver room 



iig his eye upon her face wilh a look 
as full of venom as a spiders sting 

you d a-spilt it all would yo 
he hissed the whisper in her ear as he 
pushed her from the room good 
night my dear he continued a- 
loud you better go home your 
mammy s a waitin tea for you now 
i ll make you a little bit o fire mis 
ter if you please 

fire echoed byrnewpod i 
see no fire-place 

that s all you know about it 
answered devil-bug swinging the 
furnace from side to side you 
think them are s books do you look 
a little closer next time the walls 
are only painted like books and 
shelves false book-cases you see 
and then there s glass doors jist like 
real book-cases they did it in the 
old times them queer old chaps as 
used to keep house here all alone to 
themselves nice fire-place aint it 

he opened two folding leaves of the 
false book-case near the centre of the 
wall opposite the door and a small 
fire-place neatly white-washed and 
free from ashes or the remains of any 
former fire became visible stoop 
ing on his knees devil -bug proceeded 
to arrange the furnace in the hearth 
while the half-closed folding leaves of 
the book-case well-nigh concealed 
him from view 

a false bookcase on either side of 
the room ha books of all class 
es painted on the pannels within the 
sashes with inimitable skill they 
deceived me in the dim light of yon 
der lamp what can this mean by 
my life i shrewdly suspect that these 
bookcases conceal secret 
leading from this den 



byrnewood flung himself on the 
sofa and again covered his face with 
his hands 

 blazes up quite comfortable 
muttered devil-bug as half concealed 
by the folding doors of the central 
part of the bookcase he stooped over 
the furnace of blazing coal warming 
his hands in the flame a nice fire 
and a nice fire-place but i ll have to 
discharge my bricklayer for one 
thing got him to fix up this 
harth not long ago scoundrel walled 
up the chimbley did ye ever 
hear of sich rascality konse- 
kence is this young genelmen will be 
rather uncomfortable a cause the 
charcoal smoke wont find no vent 
if i should happen to shut the door 
right tight he might die he might 
so things jist as bad have happen- 
ed afore now he might die ha 
ha ha he chuckled as he retired 
from the fire-place screening the bla 
zing furnace with the half-closed 
doors of the book-case wonder 
how that ill work 

he approached the side of byrne- 
wood with that same hideous grin dis 
torting his features but had not ad 
vanced two steps when he started 
backward with a moment of involun 
tary horror 

look here you sir he whisper 
ed grasping byrnewood by the arm 
jist look here a minnit you see the 
floor at my left side do you now 
tell us the truth aint there a dead man 
lay in there his jaw broke and hig 
tongue out not that i m afeered 
but i wants to satisfy my mind jist 
take a good look while i hold still 

i see nothing but the carpet 
answered byrnewood with a lock cf 






 



the merchant s daughter 



loathing as he observed this strange 
being standing before him motionless 
as a statute while his left hand point 
ed tc the floor i see nothing but 
the carpet 

 don t see a dead man with his 
knees dravved up to his breast and his 
tongue stickin out well that s 
queer i d take my book oath that 
the feller was a layin there nasty as 
a snake hows ever re-fresh your 
self young man there s plenty to 
eat and drink and he pointed to 
the hearth as he spoke there s a 
nice comfortable fire good charcoal 
and i wonder s how that ill 
work 

closing the door he stood in the 
small recess at the head of the stairs 
leading to the tower-room the 
huge forms of the negroes musquito 
and glow-worm were flung along the 
floor while their hard breathing indi 
cated that they slumbered on their 
watch listening intently for a sin 
gle moment at the door of the tower- 
room devil-bug slowly turned the 
key in the lock and then withdrawing 
it from the keyhole placed it in his 
pocket he stepped carefully over the 
forms of the sleeping negroes and 
passed his hands slowly along the pa 
nelling of the recess opposite the door 

 the spring ha ha i ve found 
it he muttered in the darkness 
 the bookcases dont conceal no pas 
sage between the walls of this ere 
tower and the room itself do they 
o course they do not quiet little 
places where a feller can say his pray 
ers and eat ground-nuts ha ha 
ha i must see how that ill work 

the pannelling slid back as he 
touched the spring and devil-bug 



disappeared into the secret 
or passage between the false book 
cases and the massive walls of th 
tower as the solitary chamber ri 
sing from the western wing of monk- 
flail was termed in the legends of the 
place 

meanwhile within the tower- room 
byrnewood arlington paced slowly up 
and down the floor his arms folded 
and his face impressed with a fixed 
expression that forced his lips tightly 
together darkened his brows in a set 
tled frown and drove the blood from 
his entire visage until it wore the livid 
hues of death 

i my sister in his power last 
night she was pure and stainless to 
orrow morning dawns and she will be 
thing stained with pollution dishonor- 
by a hideous crime no lapse of 
time no prayers to heaven no bitter 
tears of repentance can ever wash out 
the foul stains of her dishonor and 
i am a prisoner while she shrieks for 
help and shrieks in vain 

as byrnewood spoke striding ra- 
pidly along the floor a grateful warmth 
began to steal around the room dis 
pelling the chill and damp which 
seemed to infect the very air with an 
unwholesome taint 

 and we have been children toge 
ther i have held her in these arms 
when she was but a babe a smiling 
babe with golden hair and laughing 
cheeks and then when she left home 
for school how it wrung my soul to 
part with her so young so light- 
hearted so innocent three years 
pass she returns grown up into a 
lovely girl whose pure soul a very 
devil would not dare to tarnish she 



the tower roc 



 



return to bless the sight of her father 
her mother with her laughing face and 
giie i s dishonored i never knew 
the meaning of the word till now 
dishonored by a villian 

he flung himself on the sofa and 
covered his face with his hands 
t and yet i i wronged an inno 
cent girl because she was my father s 
servant great god can she 
have a brother to feel for her ruin 
my punishment is just but mary 
oh whom did she ever harm whom 
could she ever wrong 

he was silent again and while 
his brain was tortured by the fierce 
struggles of thought while the memo 
ries of earlier days came thronging 
over his soul the image of his sister 
present in every thought and shining 
brightest in each old-time memory 
he could feel the grateful heat which 
pervaded the atmosphere of the room 
restoring warmth and comfort to his 
limbs while his blood flowed more 
freely in his veins 

there was a long pause in which 
his very soul was absorbed in a deliri 
um of thought it may have been the 
effect of internal agitation or the re 
sult of his half-crazed intellect acting 
on his physical system but after the 
lapse of some few minutes he was 
aroused from his reverie by a painful 
throbbing around his temples which 
for a single moment destroyed all con 
sciousness and just as suddenly re 
stored him to a keen and terrible sense 
of his appaling situation now his 
drain seemed to swim in a wild deliri 
um and in a single instant as the 
throbbing around his temples grew 
more violent his mental vision seemed 
clearer and more vigorous than ever 



i cari -dy brea r he ntgt nkgtt j 
tered as he - ck on the sofa after 
a vain attempt se there is a 
hand grasping me e throat i 
feel the fingers clutci he veins 
with the grasp of a dei my 

heart ah it is turning to ice to 
ice and now it is fire my heart is 
a ball of flame the blood boils in 
my veins 

he sprung to his feet with a wild 
bound and his hands clutched madly 
at his throat as though he would free 
the veins from the grasp of the invisi 
ble fingers which were pressing 
through the very skin 

he staggered to and fro along the 
floor with his arms flung overhead as 
as if to ward off the attacks of some 
invisible foe 

his face was ghastly pale one mo 
ment the next it flushed with the 
hues of a crimson flame his large 
black eyes dilated in their glance 
and stood out from the lids as though 
they were about to fall from their sock 
ets his mouth distended with a con 
vulsive grimace while his teeth were 
firmly clenched together one in 
stant his brain would be perfectly con 
scious in all its operations the next 
his senses would swim in a fearful de 
lirium 

my god my god he shout- 
ed in one of those momentary inter 
vals of consciousness as he staggered 
wildly along the floor i am dying 
i am dying my breath comes 
thick and gaspingly my veins are 
chilled ha ha they are turned to 
fire again 

even in his delirium he was consci 
ous of a singular circumstance a 
portion of the pannelling of the false 



g 



the merchant s daughter 



bookcase alorg the vrall opposite the 
fire receded suddenly within the sash 
of the central glass-door leaving a 
space of black and vacant darkness 
the aperture was in the top of the 
bookcase near the ceiling of the room 

turning toward the hearth byrne- 
wood endeavoured to regain the sofa 
but the room seemed swimming around 
him and with a wild movement he 
again staggered toward the bookcase 
opposite the fire 

he started backward as a new hor 
ror met his gaze 

a hideous face glared upon him 
from the aperture of the book-case 
like some picture of a fiend s visage 
suddenly thrust against the glass-door 
of the book-case 

a hideous face with a single burn 
ing eye with a wide mouth distending 
in a loathsome grin with long rows 
of fang-like teeth and a protuberent 
brow overhung by thick masses of 
matted hair this face alone was 
visible surrounded by the darkness 
which marked the square outline of 
the aperture it was indeed like a 
hideous picture framed in ebony al 
though you could see the muscles of 
the face in motion while the flat nose 
was pressed against the glass of the 
book-case and the thick lips were now 
tightly closed and again distending in 
hideous grin 

 ho ho ho a laugh like the 
shout of a devil came echoing through 
the glass faint and subdued yet wild 
and terrible to hear the charcoal 
the charcoal wonder how ihatfill 
work 

byrne wood stood silent and erect 
while the throbbing of his temples the 



gasping of his breath and the deaden 
ing sensation around his heart sub 
sided for a single moment 

the full horror of his situation 
rushed upon him he way dying by 
the gas escaping from charcoal in a 
room rendered impervious to the air 
closed and sealed for the purpose of 
this horrible death 

a brilliant idea flashed across his 
brain 

i will overturn the furnace 
he muttered rushing toward the hearth 
 i will extinguish the flame 

with a sudden bound he sprang 
forward but in the very action fell to 
the floor like a drunken man 

his breath came in thick convul 
sive gasps his heart grew like a masa 
of fire while his brain was tortured by 
one intense and agonizing throb of 
pain as though some invisible hand 
had wound a red hot wire round his 
forehead he lay on the floor with 
iiis outspread hands grasping the air 
n the effort to rise 

 it works it works shouted the 
voice of devil-bug as his loathsome 
ountenance was pressed against the 
glass-door of the book-case ha 
la ha he is on the floor he 
cannot rise he is in the clutch of 
death how the poor feller kicks pnd 
scuffles 

a wild wild shriek echoing from a 
distant room came faintly to byrne- 
wood s ear that sound of a woman s 
voice shrieking for help in an em- 
hasis of despair aroused the dying 
man from the spell which began to 
deaden his senses 

it is my sister s voice he ex 
claimed springing to his feet with n

asl effort of strength she is in the 
hands of the villain i will save her 
i will save her 

 the sister outraged the bro 
ther murdered shouted devil-bug 
through the glass-door i wonder 
how that ill work 

byrnewood rushed towards the 
door it was locked and secured all 
hope was in vain he must die die 
while his sister s shriek for aid rang 
on his ears die with the loathsome 
face of his murderer pressed against 
the glass while his blazing eye feasted 
on his last convulsive agonies die 
with youth on his brow with health 
in his heart die with all purposed 
vengeance on his sister s wronger un 
fulfilled die by no sudden blow by 
no dagger thrust by no pistol shot 
but by the most loathsome of all 
deaths by suffocation 

ha ha the thought flashed 
over his brain the hangman s 
rope were a priceless luxury to me in 
this dread hour 

staggering slowly along the floor 
with footsteps as heavy as thdugh he 
nad leaden weights attached to his 
feet he approached the chest-like ta 
ble and with a faint effort to recover 
his balance sunk down on the floor 
in a crouching position while his out 
spread hands clutched faintly at the 
air 

in a moment he rolled slowly from 
side to side and lay on his back with 
nis face to the ceiling and his arms 
extended on either side his eyes 
were suddenly covered with a glassy 
film his lower jaw separated from the 
upper leaving his mouth wide open 
while the room grew warmer the air 
more dense and suffocating 



 help help murmurod byrne- 
wood in a smothered voice like the 
sound produced by a man throttled by 
nightmare help help 

 by-a-baby go to sleep that s 
a good feller the voice of devil- 
bug came like a faint echo through 
the glass a drop from the bottle 
ud do you good and jist reach 
your right hand a leetle bit further 
there ain t no spring there i sup-pose 
ain t there ho-ho-ho 

and byrnewood could feel a deli 
cious languor stealing over his frame 
as he lay there on the floor helpless 
and motionless while the voice of 
devil-bug rang in his ears the 
throbbing of his temples had subsided 
he no more experienced the quick 
gasping struggle for breath his hear 
no more passed through the quick 
transitions from cold to heat from ice 
to fire his veins no more felt like 
streams of molten lead he was sink 
ing quietly in a soft and pleasing 
slumber the film grew more glassy 
in each eye his jaws hung further 
apart and the heaving of his chest 
subsided until a faint and tremulous 
motion was the only indication that 
life had not yet fled from his frame 
his outspread arms seemed to grow 
stiffened and dead as he rested on the 
floor while the joints of the fingers 
moved faintly to and fro with a flut- 
tering motion that afforded a strange 
contrast to the complete repose of his 
body and limbs his feet were pointed 
upward like the feet of a corpse ar 
rayed for burial 

the dim light burning on the chest- 
like table afforded a faint light to the 
ghastly scene there were the un 
touched refreshments the cold chicken 



 



the merchant s daughter 



and the bottle of wine giving the 
place the air of a quiet supper-room 
there were the false book-cases indicat 
ing a resort for meditation and study 
there was the cheerful furnace its 
glowing flame flashing through the 
half-closed doors speaking a pleasant 
tale of fireside joys and comforts and 
there along the carpet stiffening and 
ghastly lay the form of byrnewood 
arlington slowly and quietly yielding 
to the slumber of death while a 
hideous face peered through the glass- 
door all distorted by a sickening 
grimace and a solitary eye that 
gleamed like t live coal drank in the 
tremulous agonies of the dying man 

 reach his hand a leetle bit further 
that s a good feller won t have 
no tumble down three stories nor 
nothin if his lingers touch the spring 
ho-ho quiet now i guess list 
look how his fingers tremble he 
he he hallo he s on his feet 
agin 

with the last involutary struggle 
of a strong man wrestling for his life 
byrnewood arlington sprang to his 
feet and reaching forth his hand with 
the same mechanical impulse that had 
raised him from the floor he seized the 
bottle of wine he raised it to his lips 
and the wine poured gurgling down 
his throat 

 hain t got no opium in i sup 
pose not the least mossel cuss it 
how he staggers believe my soul 
he s comin to life agin 

byrnewood glanced around with a 
look of momentary consciousness 
the drugged wine for a single mo 
ment created a violent re-action in 
his system and he became fully sen- 
fible of the awful death that awaited 



him he could feel the hot air warm 
ing his cheek he could see the visage 
of devil-bug peering at him thro the 
glass-door and the danger which me 
naced his sister came home like some 
horrible phantom to his soul he felt 
in his very soul that but a single mo 
ment more of consciousness would be 
permitted him for action that mo 
ment past and the death by charcoal 
would be quietly and surely accom 
plished 

 keep me oh heaven he whis 
pered as his mind ran over various ex- 
pedients for escape aid me in this 
my last effort that i may live to 
avenge my sister s dishonor 

it was his design to make one sudden 
and desperate spring toward the glass- 
door through which the hideous vi- 
sage of devil-bug glared in his face 
and as he madly dashed his hands 
through the glass the room would be 
filled with a current of fresh air 

this was his resolve but it came 
too late as he turned to make this 
desperate spring his heel pressed 
against an object rising from the floor 
near a corner of the chest-like table 
it was but a small object resembling 
a nail or spike which has not been 
driven to the head in the planking of 
a floor but suffered to remain half-ex 
posed and open to the view 

and yet the very moment byrne- 
wood s heel pressed against the trifling 
object the floor on which he stood gave 
way beneath him with a low rustling 
soundhalf of the chamber was changed 
into one black and yawning chasm 
and the lamp standing on the table sud 
denly disappeared leaving the place 
wrapt in thick darkness 

another moment passed and while 



the tower room 



 



bymewood reeled in the darkness on 
the veige of the sunken trap-door a 
hushed and distant sound echoed far 
below as from the depths of some 
deep and dismal well the lamp had 
fallen in the chasm and the faint sound 
heard far far below was the only in 
dication that it had reached the bottom 
of the gloomy void sinking down 
like a well into the cellars of monk- 
hall 

byrnewood tottered on the verge of 
the chasm while a current of cold air 
came sweeping upward from its depths 
the foul atmosphere of the tower 
room lost half its deadly qualities 
in a single moment as the cool air 
came rushing from the chasm 

byrnewood felt the effects of the 
charcoal rapidly passing from his sys 
tem and his mind regained its full 
consciousness as his hot brow receiv 
ed the freshning blast of winter air 
pouring over the parched and heated 
skin 

but the current of pure air came 
too late for his salvation tottering 
in the darkness on the very verge of 
the sunken trap-door he made one des 
perate struggle to preserve his balance 
but in vain for a moment his form 
swung to and fro and then his feet 
slid from under him and then with 
a maddening shriek he fell 

 god save poor mary 

how that last cry of the doomed 
man shrieked around the panelled 
walls of the tower room 

 wonder how that ill work the 
hoarse voice of devil-bug shrieked 
through the darkness down 
down down ah-ha three 
stones down down down 
wonders how that ill work 






separated from the tower room by 
the glass-door devil-bug pressed hia 
ear against the glass and listened for 
the death-groans of the doomed man 

a low moaning sound like the 
groan of a man who trembles under 
the operations of a surgeon s knife 
came faintly to his ear in a moment 
devil-bug thought he heard a sound 
ike a door suddenly opened and then 
the murmur of voices whispering 
some quick and hurried words re 
sounded along the tower room 
then there was a subdued noise 
like a man struggling on the brink 
of the chasm and then a hushad 
sound that might have been taken 
for the tread ol a footstep mingled 
with the closing of a door came faint 
ly through the glass of the book-case 

gliding silently from the secret re- 
ess behind the panelling of the 
tower room devil-bug stepped over 
the forms of the slumbering negroes 
and descended the stairway leading to 
the walnut room the scene of the 
wedding was wrapt in midnight dark 
ness passing softly along the floor 
devil-bug reached the entrance to the 
rose chamber and flung the hang 
ings aside with a cautious movement 
of his talon-like fingers 

 i merely wanted a light ex 
claimed devil-bug as he stood gazing 
into the rose chamber but here s 
a candle and a purty sight into the 
bargain 

he disappeared through the door 
way and after the lapse of a few mo 
ments again emerged into the walnut 
room holding a lighted candle in his 
hand 

 amazin circumstance that 
he chuckled as he strode across the 



 



the merchant s daughter 



glittering floor the brother fell in 
that are room and the sister fell in 
that about the same time they fell 
in different ways though strange 
world this let s see what become 
of the brother charcoal and opium 
-ho ho ho 

before another moment had elapsed 
he stood before the door of tower 
room musquito and glow-worm 
still slumbered on their watch their 
huge forms and hideous faces dimly 
developed in the beams of the light 
which the doorkeeper carried in his 
hand devil-bug listened intently for 
a single moment but not the slightest 
sound disturbed the silence of the 
tower room 

he opened the door he strode along 
the carpet he stood on the verge of 
the chasm produced by the falling of 
the death-trap 

 down down three stories 
and the pit below ha let me 
hold the light a leetle nearer every 
trap-door is open he is safe enough 
think i see suffin white a-flutterin 
a-way down there hollered pretty 
loud as he fell devilish ugly tumble 
guess it ill work quite nice for lor- 
rimer 

stooping on his knees with the light 
extended in his right hand he again 
gazed down the hatchway his solitary 
eye flashing with excitement as he 
endeavoured to pierce the gloom of 
the dark void beneath 

 he s gone to see his friends be 
low sartin sure no sound no 
groan not even a holler 

arising from his kneeling position 
devil -bug approached the recess of 
he fire-place on either side a plain 



panell of oak concealed the score 
nook behind the false book-case 
placing his hand cautiously along the 
panell to the right devil-bug examin 
ed the details of the carving in each 
corner and along its side with a care 
ful eye 

hasn t been opened to-night 
he murmured u leads to the wal 
nut room by a round-a-bout way 
convenient little passage if that fool 
had only knowed on it 

in an instant he stood outside of the 
tower room door holding the key in 
one hand and the candlestick in the 
other 

git up you lazy d s he 
shouted bestowing a few pointed 
kicks upon the carcases of the sleep 
ing negroes git up and mind your 
eyes or else i ll pick em out o your 
head to play marbles with 

glow-worm arose slowly from the 
floor and musquito opening his eyes 
with a sleepy yawn stared vacantly 
in the doorkeeper s face 

 d ye hear me watch this fel 
ler and see that he don t escape 
he s a sleepin now but there s no 
knowin watch i say watch 

he shuffled slowly along the nar 
row passage looking over his shoulder 
at the grinning negroes as he passed 
along while his face wore its usual 
pleasant smile as he again muttered 
in his hoarse tones watch him ye 
dogs i say watch him 

another moment and he stood be 
fore the entrance of the rose cham 
ber holding the curtaining aside 
while his eye blazed up with an ex 
pression of malignant joy he raised 
the light on high and stood gazing 
silently through the doorway as 



the crime without a name 



though his e yes beheld a spectacle of 
strange and peculiar interest 

and while he stood there chuckling 
pleasantly to himself with the full 
light of the candle flashing over his 
loathsome face two figures stood 
crouching in the darkness along the 
opposite side of the room and the 
eastern door hung slightly ajar as 
though they had entered the place but 
a moment before 

p once or twice devil-bug turned as 
though the sound of suppressed breath 
ing struck his ear but every time the 
shadow of the candle fell along the op 
posite side of the room and the crouch 
ing figures were concealed from view 

 quite a pictur chuckled 
devil-bug as he again gazed through 
the doorway of the rose chamber 
a nice little gal and a handsome 
feller ha ha ha 

he disappeared through the cur 
taining while his pleasant chuckle 
came echoing through the doorway 
with a sound of continued glee as 
though the gentleman was highly 
amused by the spectacle that broke on 
his gaze 

the silence of the rose chamber 
was broken by the tread of a footstep 
and the figure of a man came steal 
ing through the darkness with the 
form of a queenly woman by his side 

 advance and save your sister s 
honor the deep-toned whisper 
broke thrillingly on the air 

the man advanced with a hurried 
step flung the curtain hastily aside 
and gazed within the rose chamber 

the horror of that silent gaze 
would be ill-repayed by aa eternity 
of joy 



chapter thirteenth 

the crime without a name 

 my brother consents oh joy

ed in hand we will kneel before our

and i will leave you for the night 

and leaning fondly over the fair 
girl who was seated on the sofa her 



 



the merchant s daughter 






form enveloped in a flowing night-robe 
lorrimer wound h s right arm gently 
around her neck bending her head 
slowly backward in the action and 
suffering her rich curls to fall show 
ering on her shoulders while her up 
turned face all radiant with affection 
lay open to his burning gaze and her 
ripe lips dropped slightly apart dis 
closing the ivory teeth seemed to woo 
and invite the pressure of his kiss 

one kiss silent and long and the 
lover and the fair girl seemed to have 
grown to each others lips 

the wax-light standing on the 
small table of the rose chamber fell 
mild and dimly over this living picture 
of youth and passion 

the tall form of lorrimer clad in 
solemn black contrasting forcibly 
with the snow-white robes of the maid 
en his arm flung gently around her 
neck her upturned face half-hidden by 
the falling locks of his dark brown 
hair their lips joined and their eyes 
mingling in the same deep glance of 
passion while her bosom rose heaving 
against his breast and her arms hal f- 
upraised seemed about to entwine his 
form in their embrace it was a mo 
ment of pure and hallowed love on the 
part of the fair girl and even the li 
bertine for an instant forgot the vile- 
ness of his purpose in that long and 
silent kiss of stainless passion 

 mary cried lorrimer his hand 
some face flushing over with transport 
us silently gliding from his standing 
position he assumed his seat at her 
side oh would that you were 
mine we would flee u gether from 



the heartless world in some silent 
and shadowy valley we would ibrget 
all but the love which made us one 

 we would seek a home quiet and 
peaceful as that which this book de 
scribes whispered mary laying 
her hand on bulwer s play of claude 
mellnotte i found the volume 
on the table and was reading it when 
you came in oh it is all beauty and 
feeling you have read it lorraine 

 again and again and have seen it 
played a hundred times the home 
to which love could fulfil its prayersj 
this hand would lead thee he 
murmured repeating the first lines of 
the celebrated description of the lake 
of como and yet mary this is 
mere romance a creation of the 
poets brain a fiction as beautiful as 
a ray of light and as fleeting i 
i might tell you a story of a real 
valley and a real lake which i be 
held last summer where love might 
dwell forever and dwell in eternal 
youth and freshness 

oh tell me tell me cried 
mary gazing in his face with a look 
of interest 

 beyond the fair valley of wy 
oming of which so much lias been 
said and sung there is a high and ex 
tensive range of mountains covered 
with thick and gloomy forests one 
day tast september when the summer 
was yet in its freshness and bloom 
toward the hour of sunset i found 
myself wandering through a thick 
wood that covered the summit of one 
of the highest of these mountains i 
had been engaged in a deer-hunt all 
day had strayed from my com 
rades and now as night was coming 



the crime without a name 



 



on was wandering along a wind 
ing path that led to the top of the 
mountain 

lorrimer paused for a single instant 
and gazed intently in mary s face 
every feature was animated with sud 
den interest and a warm flush hung 
freshly on each cheek 

and as lorrimer gazed upon the 
animated face of the innocent girl 
marking its rounded outlines its hues 
of youth and loveliness its large blue 
eyes beaming so gladly upon his 
countenance the settled purpose of his 
soul came home to him like a sudden 
shadow darkening over a landscape 
after a single gleam of sunlight 

it was the purpose of this libertine 
to dishonor the stainless girl before he 
left her presence 

before day break she would be a pollu 
ted thing whose name and virtue and 
soul would be blasted forever j 

in that silent gaze which drank in the 
beauty of the maiden s face lorrimer 
arranged his plan of action the book 
which he had left upon the table the sto 
ry which he was about to tell were the 
ifirst intimations of his atrocious design 
while enchaining the mind of the 
maiden with a story full of romance 
it was his intention to wake her ani 
mal nature into full action and when 
her veins were all alive with fiery pul 
sations when her heart grew animate 
with sensual life when her eyes swam 
in the humid moisture of passion 
then she would sink helplessly into his 
arms and like the bird to the snake 
flutter to her ruin 

 force violence these are 
but the tools of grown-up children 
who know nothing of the mystery of 
woman s heart the thought flash 



ed over lorrimer s brain as hjs lip 
wore a very slight but weaning smile 

i have deeper means than these 
i employ neither force nor threats 
nor fraud nor violence my victim 
is the instrument of her own ruin 
without one rude grasp from my hand 
without one threatning word she swims 
willingly to my arms 

he took the hand of the fair girl 
within his own and looking her stea 
dily in the eye with a deep gaze 
which every instant grew more vivid 
and burning he went on with his story 

and his design 

 the wood grew very dark a- 
round me were massive trees with 
thick branches and gnarled trunks 
bearing witness of the storms of an 
hundred years my way led over a 
path covered with soft forest-moss 
and now and then red gleams of sun 
light shot like arrows of gold between 
the overhanging leaves darker and 
darker the twilight sank down upon 
the forest at last missing the path 
i knew not which way to tread all 
was dark and indistinct now fall 
ing over a crumbling limb which had 
been thrown down by a storm long be 
fore now entangled by the wild vines 
that overspread portions of the ground 
and now missing my foothold in some 
hidden crevice of the earth i wander 
ed wearily on at last climbing up a 
sudden elevation of the mountain i 
stood upon a vast rock that hung over 
the depths below like an immense 
platform on all sides but one this 
rock was encircled by a waving wall 
of forest-leaves green shrubs swept 
circling around enclosing it like a 
fairy bower while the eastern side 
lay open to the beams of the moon 



 



the merchant s daughter 



jvhich now rose grandly in the vas 
horizon far over wood far over 
mountain far over ravine and dell 
this platform-rock commanded a dis 
tant view of the valley of wyoming 
 the moon was in the sky mary 
the sky was one vast sheet of blue 
undimmed by a single cloud and be 
neath the moonbeams lay a sea of fo 
rest-leaves while in the dim distance 

like the shore of this leafy ocean 

arose the roofs and steeples of a 
quiet town with a broad river rolling 
along the dark valley like a banner of 
silver flung over a sable-pall 

 how beautiful 

and as the murmur escaped mary s 
lips the hand of lorrimer grew closer 
in its pressure while his left arm 
wound gently around her waist 

 i stood entranced by the sight a 
cool breeze came up the mountain side 
imparting a grateful freshness to my 
cheek the view was indeed beau 
tiful but i suddenly remembered that 
i was without resting-place or shelter 
ignorant of the mountain paths afar 
from any farm-house or village i had 
still a faint of hope of discovering the 
the temporary habitation of some hun 
ter who had encamped in these forest- 
wilds 

 i turned from the magnificent 
prospect i brushed aside the wall of 
leaves i looked to the western sky 
i shall never forget the view which 
like a dream of fairy -land burst on 
my sight as pushing the shrubbery 
aside i gazed from the western limits 
of the platform-rock 

 there below me imbedded in the 
very summit of the mountain lay a 
calm lake whose crystal- waters gave 
back the reflection of forest and sky 



like an immense mirror it was but 
a mile in length and half that distance 
in width on all sides sudden and 
steep arose the encircling wall of fo 
rest trees like wine in a goblet that 
calm sheet of water lay in the em 
brace of the surrounding wall of fo 
liage the waters were clear so 
tranquil that i could see down down 
far far beneath as if another world 
was hidden in their depths and then 
from the heights the luxuriant foliage 
as yet untouched by autumn sank in 
waves of verdure to the very brink of 
the lake the trembling leaves dipping 
in the clear cold waters with a gen 
tle motion it was very beautifuj 
mary and 

oh most beautiful 

the left hand of lorrimer gently 
stealing round her form rested with a 
faint pressure upon the folds of the 
night-robe over her bosom which now 
came heaving tremulously into light 

 i looked upon this lovely lake 
with a keen delight i gazed upon the 
tranquil waters upon the steeps 
crowned with forest-trees one side 
in heavy shadow the other gleaming 
n the advancing moonbeams i 
seemed to inhale the quietness the so 
litude of the place as a holy influence 
mingling with the very air i breathed 
and a wild transport aroused my soul 
nto an outburst of enthusiasm 

 here i cried is the home for 
love love pure and stainless fly- 
ng from the crowded city here can 
repose beneath the shadow of quiet 
rocks beside the gleam of tranquil 
waters within the solitudes of endless 
brests yon sky so clear so cloud- 
ess has never beheld a sight of hu 
man misery or wo yon lake 



the crime without a name 



ill 



ing beneath me like another sky has 
never been crimsoned by human blood 
this quiet valley hidden from the 
world now as it has been hidden since 
the creation is but another world 
where two hearts that love that mingle 
in one that throb but for each other s 
joy can dwell forever in the calm si 
lence of unalloyed affection 

 a home for love such as angels 
feel 

closer and more close the hand of 
lorrimer pressed against the heaving 
bosom with but the slight folds of the 
night-robe between 

 here beside this calm lake when 
ever the love of a true woman shall 
be mine here afar from the cares and 
realities of life will i dwell here 
with the means which the accident of 
ortune has bestowed will i build not 
a temple not a mansion not a palace 
but a cottage a quiet home whose 
roof shall arise like a dear hope in 
the wilderness from amid the green 
leaves of embowering trees 

 you spoke thus lorraine do 
i not love you as a true woman should 
love is not your love calm and 
stainless as the waters of the mountain 
lake we will dwell there lor- 
-raine oh how like romance will be 
the plain reality of our life 

 oh mary my own true love in 
that moment as i stood gazing upon 
the world-hidden lake my heart all 
throbbing with strange impulses my 
very soul steeped in a holy calm 
your form seemed to glide between my 
eyes and the moonlight the thought 
rushed like a prophecy over my soul 
hat one day amid the barren wilder 
ness of hearts which crowd the world 
 should fine one one heart whose 
 



i impulses should be stainless whose ai- 

j fection should be undying whose love 

j should be mine oh mary in that 

moment i felt that my life would one 

day be illumined by your love 

 and then you knew me not oh 
 lorraine is there not a strange mys 
tery in this affection which makes the 
heart long for the love which it shall 
one day experience even before the 
eye has seen the beloved one 

brighter grew the glow on her 
cheek closer pressed the hand on hei 
bosom warmer and higher arose that 
bosom in the light 

and there mary in that quiet 
mountain valley we will seek a home 
when we are married as soon as 
summer comes when the trees are 
green and the flowers burst from 
among the moss along the wood-path 
we will hasten to the mountain lake 
and dwell within the walls of our 
quiet home for a home shall be 
reared for us mary on a green glade 
that slopes down to the water s brink 
with the tall trees sweeping away on 
either side 

 a quiet little cottage mary with 
a sloping roof and small windows all 
fragrant with wild flowers and forest 
vines a garden before the door 
mary where in the calm summer 
morning you can inhale the sweetness 
of the flowers as they breath forth in 
untamed luxuriance and then an 
chored by the shore mary a light 
sail-boat will be ready for us ever to 
bear us over the clear lake in the 
early dawn when the mist winds 
up in fleecy columns to the sky 
in the twilight when the red scm 
flings his last -ay over the waters 
or in the silent night when the moon 



 



the merchant s daughter 



is up and the stars look kindly on us 
from the cloudless sky 

 alas lorraine clouds may 
come and storms and winter 

 what care we for winter when 
eternal spring is in our hearts let 
winter come with its chill and its ice 
and its snows beside our cheerful 
fire mary with our hands clasping 
some book whose theme is the trials 
of two hearts that loved on through 
difficulty and danger or death we will 
sit silently our hearts throbbing with 
one delight while the long hours 
of the winter evening glide quietly 
on do you see the fire mary 
how cheerily its beams light our 
faces as we sit in its kindly light 
my arm is round your waist mary 
my cheek is laid next to yours our 
hands are locked together and your 
heart mary oh how softly its throb- 
bings fall on my ear 

 oh lorraine why is there any 
care in the world when two hearts 
can make such a heaven on earth 
with the holy lessons of an all -trust 
ing love 

 or it may be mary and his 
gaze grew deeper while his voice 
sank to a low and thrilling whisper 
 or it may be mary that while we 
sit beside our winter fire a fair babe 
do not blush my wife a fair babe 
will rest smiling on your bosom 

 oh lorraine she murmured 
and hid her face upon his breast her 
long brown tresses covering her neck 
and shoulders like a veil while lor 
raine wound his arms closely round 
her form and looked around with a 
glance full of meaning 

there was triumph in that glance 
the libertine felt her heart throbbing 



against his breast as he held her in hi 
arms he felt her bosom panting and 
heaving and quivering with a quick 
fluttering pulsation and as he swept 
the clustering curls aside from her 
half-hidden face he saw that her cheek 
glowed like a new-lighted flame 

 she is mine he thought and a 
smile of triumph gave a dark aspect 
to his handsome face 

in a moment mary raised her glow 
ing countenance from his breast she 
gazed around with a timid frightened 
look her breath came thick and 
gaspingly her cheeks were all 
a-glow her blue eyes swam in a hazy 
dimness she felt as though she was 
about to fall swooning on the floor 
for a moment all consciousness 
seemed to have failed her while a de 
lirious langor came stealing over her 
senses lorrimer s form seemed to 
swim in the air before her and the 
dim light of the room gave place to a 
flood of radiance which seemed all at 
once to pour on her eyesight from 
some invisible source soft murmurs 
like voices heard in a pleasant dream 
fell gently on her ears the langor 
came deeper and more mellow over 
her limbs her bosom rose no longer 
quick and gaspingly but in long pul 
sations that urged the full globes in 
all their virgin beauty softly and 
slowly into view like billows they 
rose above the folds of the night robe 
while the flush grew warmer on her 
cheek and her parted lips deepened 
into a rich vermillion tint 

 she is mine and the same dark 
smile flushed over lorrimer s face 
silent and motionless he sat regard 
ing his victim with a steadfast glance 

 oh lorraine she cried in a 



the crime without a name 



 



gasping voice as she felt a strange 
unconsciousness stealing over her 
senses oh lorraine save me 

save me 

she arose tottering on her feet 
flinging her hands aloft as though 
she stood on the brink of some fright 
ful steep without the power to retreat 
from its crumbling edge 

 there is no danger for you my 
mary whispered lorrimer as he 
received her falling form in his out 
spread arms there is no danger 
for you my mary 

he played with the glossy curls of 
her dark brown hair as he spoke 
while his arms gathered her half- 
swooning form full against his heart 

she is mine hex blood is 
a-flame her senses swim in a deli 
rium of passion while the story fell 
from my lips i aroused her slumber 
ing woman s nature j talk of force 

ha ha she rests on my bosom 
as though she would grow there 

as these thoughts half escaped 
from his lips in a muttered whisper 
his face shone with the glow of sen 
sual passion while his hazel eye di 
lated with a glance whose intense 
lustre had but one meaning dark and 
atrocious 

she lay on his breast her senses 
wrapt in a feverish swoon that laid her 
powerless in his arms while it left her 
mind vividly sensible of the approacb- 
ing danger 

 mary my love no danger 
threatens you he whispered play 
ing with her glossy curls look 
up my love am with you and 
will shield you from harm 

gathering her form in his left arm 
secure of his victim he raised her 



from his breast and fixing his gaze 
upon her blue eyes humid with mois 
ture he slowly flung back the night 
robe from her shoulders her bosom 
in all its richness of outline heaving 
and throbbing with that long pulsation 
which urged it upward like a billow 
lay open to his gaze 

and at the very moment that ner 
fair breast was thrown open to his sen 
sual gaze she sprang from his em 
brace with a wild shriek and instinc 
tively gathered her robe over her 
bosom with a trembling movement 
of her fair white hands the touch 
of the seducer s hand polluting her 
stainless bosom had restored her to 
sudden consciousness 

 lorraine lorraine she shriek 
ed retreating to the farthest corner of 
the room oh save me save 
me 

 no danger threatens you my 
mary 

he advanced as he spoke toward 
the trembling girl who had shrunk 
into a corner of the room crouching 
closely to the rose-hued hangings 
while with her head turned over her 
shoulder and her hands clasped across 
her bosom she gazed around with a 
glance full of terror and alarm 

lorrimer advanced toward the 
crouching girl he had been sure 
of his victim he did not dream of 
any sudden outburst of terror from 
the half swooning maiden as she lay 
helpless on his breast as he ad 
vanced a change came over his ap 
pearance his face grew purple and 
the veins of his eyes filled with hick 
red blood he trembled as he walked 
across the floor and his chest heaved 



 



the merchant s daughter 



and throbbed beneath his white vest 
as though he found it difficult to 
breathe 

god save poor mary now 

looking over her shoulder she 
caught a gleam of his blood-shot eyei 
and read her ruin there 

 mary there is no danger he 
muttered in a husky voice as she 
shrunk back from his touch let 
me raise you from the floor 

 save me oh lorraine save 
me she cried in a voice of terror 
crouching closer to the hangings along 
the wall 

 from what shall i save you 
lie whispered in a voice unnaturally 
soft and gentle as though he en 
deavoured to hide tne rising anger 
which began to gleam from his eye 
when he found himself foiled in 
tne very moment of triumph from 
what shall i save you 

 from yourself she shrieked 
m a frightened tone oh lorraine 
you love me you will not harm me 
oh save me save me from yourself 

playing with the animal nature of 
the stainless girl lorrimer had arous 
ed the sensual volcano of his own base 
heart while he pressed her hand 
while he gazed in her eyes while he 
wound his embrace around her form 
he had anticipated a certain and grate 
ful conquest he had not dreamed 
that the humid eye the heaving bosom 
the burning cheek of mary arlington 
were aught but the signs of his corning 
triumph resistance prayers tears 
he had not anticipated these the 
fiend was up in his soul the liber 
tine had gone too far to recede 

he stood before the crouching girl 
i fearful picture of incarnate 



sudden as the shadow after the light 
this change had passed over his soul 
his form arose towering and erect his 
chest throbbed with sensual excite 
ment his hands hung madly clinched 
by his side while his curling hair fell 
wild and disordered over his brows f 
darkening in a hideous frown and hilt 
mustachioed lip wore the expression 
of his fixed and unalterable purpose 
his blood-shot eyes flashed with the 
unholy light of passion as he stood 
sternly surveying the form of his 
victim there was something wild 
and brutal in their savage glare 

this is all folly he said in 
that low toned and husky voice 
rise from the flocr mary you 
don t hink pd harm you t 

he stooped to raise her from th 
floor but she shrank from his extend 
ed hands as though there was pollu 
tion in his slightest touch 

 mary i wish you to rise from the 
floor 

his clenched hands trembled as ho 
spoke and the flush of mingled anger 
and sensual feeling deepened over his 
face 

 oh lorraine she cried fling 
ing herself on her knees before him 
 oh lorraine you will not harm 
me this is not you lorraine it can 
riot be you you would not look 
darkly on me your voice would not 
grow harsh as it whispered my name 
it is not lorraine that i see it 
is an evil spirit 

it was an evil spirit she said and 
yet looked up into his blood-shot eyes 
for a gleam of mercy as she spoke 
and with her trembling fingers wrung 
his clinched right hand and clasped 
it wildly to her bosom 



the crime without a name 



 



pure stainless innocent her hear 
a heaven of love her mind child-like 
m its knowledge of the world shlt 
knew not what she feared she die 



not fear the shame which the 



good 



world would heap upon her she die 
not fear the dishonor because it woulc 
be followed by such pollution that no 
man in honor might call her wife 
no child in innocence might whisper 
her name as mother she did not 
fear the foul wrong as society with 
its million tongues and eyes fears it 
and holds it in abhorence ever visiting 
the guilt of the man upon the head 
of his trembling victim 

mary feared the dishonor because 
her soul with some strange conscious 
ness of approaching evil deemed it 
a foul spirit who had arisen not 
much to visit her with wrong as to 
destroy the love she felt for lorrimer 
not for herself but for his sake she 
feared that nameless crime which al 
ready glared upon her from the blood 
shot eyes of her lover her lover 

 oh lorraine you will not harm 
me for the sake of god save me 
save me 

she clasped his hand with a closer 
grasp and gathered it tremblingly to 
her bosom while her eyes dilating 
with a glance of terror were fixed 
upon his face 

mary this is madness no 
thing but madness he said in that 
voice grown hoarse with passion and 
rudely tore his hand from her grasp 

another instant and stooping sud 
denly he caught her form in his arms 
and raised her struggling from her 
very feet 

 mary you are mine he 
hissed the whisper in her ear and ga 



thered her quivering form more close 
ly to his heart 

there was a low-toned and hideous 
laugh muttering or growling through 
the air as he spoke and the form of 
devil-bug stole with a hushed foot 
step from the entrance of the walnut 
chamber and seizing the light in his 
talon-fingers glided from the room 
with the same hyena laugh which had 
announced his appearance 

 the trap the bottle the fire 
for the brother he muttered as 
his solitary eye glanced upon the li 
bertine and his struggling victim 
neither of whom had marked his 
ntrance for the sister ha 
a ha the handsome devil -bug 
monk gusty tends to her 
bijah did nt listen for nothin ha 
ha this beats the charcoal quite hol- 
ow 

he disappeared and the rose cham 
ber was wrapt in midnight darkness 

darkness there was a struggle 
and a shriek and a prayer dark 
ness there was an oath and a groan 
mingling in chorus darkness a 
wild cry for mercy a name madly 
hrieked and a fierce execration 
arkness another struggle a low 
noaning sound and a stillness like 
bat of the grave now darkness and 
ilence mingle together and all is still 

in some old book of mysticism and 

uperstition i have read this wild 

egend which mingling as it does the 

rrible with the grotesque has still its 

meaning and its moral 

in the sky far far above the earth 
so the legend runs there hangs 
n awful bell invisible to mortal eye 



 



the merchant s daughter 



which angel hands alone may toll 
which is never tolled save when the 
unpardonable sin is committed on 
earth and then its judgment peal rings 
out like the blast of the archangel s 
trumpet breaking on the ear of the 
criminal and on his ear alone with 
a sound that freezes his blood with hor 
ror the peal of the bell hung in 
the azure depths of space announces 
to the guilty one that he is an outcast 
from god s mercy for ever that his 
crime can never be pardoned while 
the throne of the eternal endures 
that in the hour of death his soul will 
be darkened by the hopeless prospect 
of an eternity of wo wo without li 
mit despair without hope the torture 
of the never-dying worm and the un 
quenchable flame forever and forever 

reader did the sound of the 
judgment bell pealing with one aw 
ful toll from the invisible air break 
over the soul of the libertine as in 
darkness and in silence he stood shud 
dering over the victim of his crime 
p if in the books of the last day 
there shall be found written down but 
one unpardonable crime that crime 
will be known as the foul wrong ac 
complished in the gaudy rose cham 
ber of monk-hall by the wretch who 
now stood trembling in the darkness 
of the place while his victim lay 
senseless at his feet j 

there was darkness and silence for 
a few brief moments and then a 
stream of light flashed around the 
rose chamber 

like a fiend returned to witness 
ome appalling scene of guilt which he 
had but a moment left devil-bug stood 



in the doorway of the wanut cham- 
her he grimly smiled as he survey 
ed the scene 

and then with a hurried gesture a 
pallid face and blood-shot eyes as 
though some phantom tracked his 
footsteps lorrimer rushed madly by 
him and disappeared into the painted 
chamber at the very moment of his 
disappearance devil bug raised the 
light on high and started backward 
with a sudden impulse of surprise 

 dead dead and come to life 
he shrieked and then the gaze of his 
solitary eye was fixed upon the en 
trance to the walnut room with a 
mechanical gesture he placed the light 
upon the table and fled madly from the 
chamber while the curtains opening 
into the walnut room rustled to and 
fro for a single instant and then a 
ghastly face with livid cheeks and burn 
ing eyes appeared between the crimson 
folds gazing silently around the place 
with a glance that no living man 
would choose to encounter for his 
weight in gold it was so like the 
look of one arisen from the dead 



chapter fol hteenth 

the guiltt wipe 

the light of the dark-lanther 
streamed around the a at where tfo 
merchant stood 

behind him all was darkness while 
the lanthern held extended i his left 
hand flung a ruddy blaze o it over 
the outlines of the massive long 



the guilty wife 



 



floor concealing the bed from view 
while from within the gorgeous curtain 
ing that low softened sound like a wo 
man breathing in her sleep came faint 
ly to the merchant s ear 

livingstone advanced the man 
ner in which he held the lanthern flung 
his face in shadow but you could see 
that his form quivered with a tremu 
lous motion and in the attempt to 
smother a groan which arose to his 
lips a thick gurgling sound like the 
death-rattle was heard in his throat 

gazing from the shadow that enve 
loped his face livingstone with an in 
voluntary glance took in the details of 
the gorgeous couch the rich curtain 
ing of light azure satin closely drawn 
around the bed the canopy overhead 
surmounted by a circle of glittering 
stars arranged like a coronet and 
the voluptuous shapes assumed by the 
folds as they fell drooping to the floor 
all burst like a picture on his eye 

beside the bed stood a small table 
resembling a lady s work stand co 
vered with a plain white cloth the 
silver sheath of a large bowie knife 
resting on the white cloth shone glit 
tering in the light and attracted the 
merchant s attention 

he laid the pistol which he held at 
his right side upon the table and rais 
ed the bowie knife to the light the 
sheath was of massive silver and the 
blade of the keenest steel the han 
dle fashioned like the sheath of mas 
sive silver bore a single name engra 
ved in large letters near the hilt al 
gernon fitz-cowles and on the blade 
of polished steel amid a wreath of 
flowers glittered the motto in the ex- 



silk curtains of rich azure fell droop- j pressive slang of southern braggarts- 
ing in voluminous folds to the very stranger avoid a snag 

silently livingstone examined the 
blade of the murderous weapon it 
was sharp as a razor with the glit 
tering point inclining from the edge 
like a turkish dagger the merchant 
grasped the handle of this knife in his 
right hand and holding the lanthern 



on high advanced to the bedside 

 his own knife muttered liv 
ingstone shall find its way to his 
cankered heart 

with the point of the knife he silent 
ly parted the hangings of the bed and 
the red glare of the lanthern flashed 
within the azure folds revealing a 
small portion of the sleeping couch 

a moment passed and livingstone 
seemed afraid to gaze within the hang 
ings for he turned his head aside 
more than once and the thick gurg 
ling noise 
throat 



again was heard in his 
at last raising the lanthern 



gently overhead so that its beams 
would fall along a small space of the 
couch while the rest was left in dark 
ness and grasping the knife with a 
firmer hold he gazed upon the specta 
cle disclosed to his view 



her head deep sunken in a downy 
pillow a beautiful woman lay wrapt 
in slumber by the manner in which 
the silken folds of the coverlid were 
disposed you might see that her form 
was full large and voluptuous thick 
masses of jet-black hair fell glossy 
and luxuriant over her round neck 
and along her uncovered bosom which 
swelling with the full ripeness of 
womanhood rose gently in the light 
she lay on her side with her head 
resting easily on one large round arm 



 



the merchant s daughter 






half hidden by the masses of black 
hair streaming over the snow white 
pillow while the other arm was flung 
carelessly along her form the light 
falling softly over the clear transpa 
rent skin the full roundness of its 
shape and the small and delicate hand 
resting gently on the coverlid 

her face appearing amid the tresses 
of her jet-black hair like a fair picture 
half-hidden in sable drapery was 
marked by a perfect regularity of fea 
ture a high forehead arching eye 
brows and long dark lashes resting 
on the velvet skin of each glowing 
cheek her mouth was opened slightly 
as she slept the ivory whiteness of 
her teeth gleaming through the rich 
vermillion of her parted lips 

she lay on that gorgeous couch in 
an attitude of voluptuous ease a per 
fect incarnation of the sensual woman 
who combines the beauty of a mere 
animal with an intellect strong and 
resolute in its every purpose 

and over that full bosom which 
rose and fell with the gentle impulse 
of slumber over that womanly bosom 
which should have been the home of 
pure thoughts and wifely affections 
was laid a small and swarthy hand 
whose fingers heavy withringspressed 
against the ivory skin all streaked 
with veins of delicate azure and clung 
twiningly among the dark tresses 
that hung drooping over the breast 
as its globes rose heaving into view 
like worlds of purity and womanhood 

it was a strange sight for a man to 
gtee whose only joy in earth or 
heaven was locked within that snowy 
bosom and yet livingstone the hus 
band stood firm and silent as he 



gazed upon that strange hand half 
hidden by the drooping curls 

it required but a slight motion of his 
hand and the glare of the light flashed 
over the other side of the couch the 
flash of the lanthern among the 
shadows of the bed was but for a mo 
ment and yet livingstone beheld the 
face of a dark-hueo man whose long 
dark hair mingled its heavy curls with 
the glossy tresses of his wife while 
his hand reaching over her shoulder 
rested like a thing of foul pollution 
upon her bosom 

they slumbered together slumber 
ed in their guilt and the avenger 
stood gazing upon their faces while 
their hearts were as unconscious of hi 
glance as they were of the death whicl 
glittered over them in the upraised 
knife 

 wife of mine your slumber 
shall be deep and long 

and as the whisper hissed from be 
tween the clenched teeth of the hus 
band he raised the dagger suddenly 
aloft and then brought it slowly down 
until its point quivered within a fin 
ger s width of the heaving bosom 
while the light of the lanthern held 
above his head streamed over his livid 
face and over the blooming counte 
nance of his fair young wife 

the dagger glittered over her 
bosom lower and lower it sank until 
a deeper respiration a single heart- 
drawn sigh might have forced the 
silken skin upon the glittering point 
when the guilty woman murmured in 
her sleep 

 algernon a coronet wealth 
and power were the broken words 
that escaped from her lin 

again the husband raised the knife 



the guilty wife 



lit 



hut it was with the hand clenched and 
the sinews stiffened for the work of 
death 

 seek your algernon in the grave 
 he whispered with a convulsive 
smile as his blue eyes all alive with 
a glance like a madman s gaze sur 
veyed the guilty wife let the coro 
net be hung around your fleshless 
skull let your wealth be a coffin 
and ha ha your power cor 
ruption and decay 

it may have been that some feeling 
of the olden-time when the image of 
that fair young wife dwelt in the 
holiest temple of his heart came sud 
denly to the mind of the avenger in 
that moment of fearful suspense for 
his hand trembled for an instant and 
he turned his gaze aside while a single 
scalding tear rolled down his livid 
cheek 

algernon murmured the wife 
 we will seek a home 

 in the grave 

and the dagger rose and gleamed 
like a stream of flame overhead and 
then sank down with a whirring sound 

is the bosom red with the stain of 
blood 

has the keen knife severed the 
veins and pierced the heart 

the blow of a strong arm stricken 
over livingstone s shoulder dashed 
his hand suddenly aside and the knife 
sank to the very hilt in tne pillow 
within a hair s breadth of dora s face 
the knife touched the side of her 
cheek and a long and glossy curl 
severed from her head by the blow 
lay resting on the pillow 

livingstone turned suddenly round 
with a deep muttered oath while his 
massive form rose towering to its full 



height luke harvey stood before 
him his cold and glittering eye fixed 
upon his face with an expression of 
the deepest agitation 

 stand back sir muttered li 
vingstone with a quivering lip 
 this spot is sabred to me i want 
no witness to my wrong nor to my 
vengeance 

 ha ha sneered luke bending 
forward until his eyes glared fixedly 
in the face of the husband is this 
a vengeance for a man like you 

 luke again i warn you leave 
me to my shame and its punish 
ment 

shame punishment ha ha you 
have been wronged in secret 
slowly and quietly pronged and yet 
would punish that wrong by k olow 
that brings but a single pang 

luke you are right whis 
pered livingstone his agitated manner 
subsiding into a look of calm and fear 
ful determination the wrong has 
been secret long in progress horrible 
in result so let the punishment be 
she shall see the death and his 
eye flashed with a maniac wildness 
 she shall see the death as it slowly 
approaches she shall feel it as it 
winds its very fangs into her very 
heart she shall know that all hope is 
in vain while my voice will whisper 
in her freezing ear dora it is by 
my will that you die shriek dora 
shriek for aid death is cold and 
icy i can save you i your 
husband i can save you but will 
not die adultress die 

algernon murmured dora 
half-awakened from her sleep there 
is a cold hand laid against mv 
cheek 



 



the merchant s daughter 



 she wakes whispered luke 
the dagger the lanthern 

it required but a single moment for 
livingstone to draw the knife from th 
pillow where it rested against th 
bloc -fling cheek of the wife while 
luke with a sudden moment graspec 
the lanthern and closed its door leav 
ing the chamber wrapt in midnigh 
darkness 

the husband stood motionless as a 
stone and luke held his very breath 
as the voice of dora broke on their 
ears in tones of alarm and terror 

algernon she whispered as 
she started from herslumber awake 
do you not hear the sound of voi 
ces by the bedside hist could it 
have been the dream algernon 
deuced uncomfortable to be waked- 
up this way murmured a sleepy 
voice what s the matter dora 
what about a dream 

 i was awakened just now from my 
sleep by the sound of voices 
i thought a blaze of light flashed round 
the room while my hus that is li 
vingstone stood at the bedstead and 
then i felt a cold hand laid against my 
cheek 

 ha ha rather good that 
d ye know dora that i had a dream 
too i dreamt that i was in the 
front parlor second story you know 
in your house on fourth street when 
the old fellow came in and read your 
note on the table ha ha and then 
are you listening i thought that 
the old gentleman while he was read 
ing turned to a bright pea-green in the 
face and 

 hist do you not hear some one 
breathing in the room 

pshaw dora you re nervous go 



to sleep my love don t loose your 
rest for all the dreams in the world 
good night dora 

 a little touch of farce with our 
tragedy half-muttered luke as a 
quiet chuckle shook his frame 
 egad if they talk in this strain 
much longer i ll have to guffaw it s 
rather too much for my risibles this 
is a husband standing in the dark 
by the bedside while his wife and her 
paramour are telling their pleasant 
dreams in which he figures as the 
hero 

whether a smile passed over li 
vingstone s face or a frown luke 
could not tell for the room was dark 
as a starlit night yet the quick gasp 
ing sound of a man struggling for 
breath heard through the darkness 
seem to indicate any thing but the plea 
sant laugh or the jovial chuckle 

 they sleep again muttered luke 
 she has sunken into slumber 
while death watches at the bedside 
curse it how that fellow snores 

there was a long pause of dark 
ness and silence no word escaped 
the husband s lips no groan convul 
sed his chest no half-muttered cry of 
agony indicated the struggle which 
was silently rending his soul as with 
a viper s fangs 

livingstone whispered luke 
after a long pause where are you 
onfound it man i can t hear you 
gtreathe i m afraid to uncover the 
ight it may awaken them again 
 say livingstone had n t we better 
eave these quarters 

 i could have borne expressions of 
remorse from her lips i could have 
istened to sudden outpourings of hor 
or wrung from her soul by the very 



the guilty wife 



 



blackness of her guilt but this grovel 
ling familiarity with vice 

 matter-of-fat pollution as you 
might observe whispered luke 

 luke i tell you the cup is full to 
overflowing but i will drain it to the 
dregs 

now s your time whispered 
luke as swinging the curtain aside 
he suffered the light of the lanthern to 
fall over the bed dora looks quite 
pretty fitz-cowles decidedly inte 
resting 

 and on that bosom have i slept 
exclaimed livingstone in a voice of 
agony as he gazed upon his slumber 
ing wife those arms have clung 
round my neck and now ha 
luke you may think me mad but i 
tell ye man that there is the spirit of 
a slow and silent revenge creeping 
through my veins she has dishonor 
ed me do you read anything like 
forgiveness in my face 

 not much o it i assure you but 
come livingstone let s be going 
this is not the time nor place for 
your revenge let s travel 

livingstone laid down the bowie 
knife and with a smile of bitter 
mockery seized a small pair of scissors 
from the work-basket which stood on 
the table 

 you smile luke he whispered 
as leaning over the bedside he laid 
his hand upon the jet-black hair of the 
slumbering fitz-cowles ha-ha 
i will leave the place but d ye see 
luke i must take some slight keep 
sake to remind me of the gallant 
colonel a lock of his hair you 
know luke 

 egad livingstone i believe 
you re going mad a lock of his 



hair pshaw you ll want a straight 
jacket soon 

 and a lock of my dora s hair 
whispered livingstone as his blue 
eyes flashed from beneath his dark 
eyebrows while his lips wore that 
same mocking smile but you see 
the knife saved me all trouble here 
is a glossy tress severed by the colo 
nel s dagger now let me wind them 
together luke let me lay them next 
to my heart luke yes smile my 
fellow ha ha ha 

 hist your wife stirs in her 
sleep you will awaken them again 

 d ye know luke cried liv 
ingstone drawing his partner close to 
his side and looking in his face with 
a vacant glance that indicated a tem 
porary derangement of intellect 

d ye know luke that i didn t do 
that o my own will hist luke 
closer closer i ll tell you the 
devil was at the bedside luke he 
whispered it in my ear he bade me 
take these keepsakes ha ha ha 
what a jolly set of fellows we are 
and then luke his voice sank to 
a thrilling whisper he pointed 
with his iron hand to the last scene 
in which my vengeance shall be 
complete she shall beg for mercy 
luke aye on her knees but ha 
ha ha kill jcill kill is writ 
ten in letters of blood before my eyes 
every where luke every where 
don t you see it 

he pointed vacantly at the air as he 
spoke and seized luke by the shoul 
der as though he would command his 
attention to the blood-red letters 

luke was conscious that he stood 
in the presence of a madman 

inflexible as he was in his own se 



 



the merchant s daughter 



cret purpose of revenge upon the wo 
man who had trampled on his very 
heart luke still regarded the mer 
chant with a feeling akin to brother 
hood as the fearful fact impressed 
itself on his soul that livingstone 
stood before him deprived of reason 
an expression of the deepest feeling 
shadowed the countenance of luke 
and his voice was broken id its tones 
as he endeavoured to persuade the 
madman to leave the scene of his dis 
honor and shame 

 come livingstone let us go 
said luke taking his partner by 
the arm and leading him gently to 
ward the closet 

 but i ve got the keepsakes safe 
luke whispered livingstone as 
tfrat wild light flashed from his large 
blue eyes d ye see the words in 
the air luke now they change to 
her name dora dora dora all 
in blood-red letters i say luke let s 
have a quiet whist party there s 
four of us dora and i you and 
fitz-cowles 

 i m willing exclaimed luke 
as with a quick movement he seized 
the pistol left by livingstone on the 
table and concealed it within the 
breast of his greatcoat suppose we 
step into the next room and get every 
thing ready for the party 

 you re keen luke keen but i m 
even with you whispered living 
stone as his livid face lighted up with 
n sudden gleam of intelligence 
 here we stand on the threshold of 
this closet we are about to leave my 
wife s bed-room you think i m mad 
do i look like a madman i know 
rhre is no whist-paity to be held this 



night i know that hist luke 
don t you see it all pictured forth in 
the air the scene of my vengeance t 
in colors of blood painted by the 
devil s hand yonder luke yon 
der how red it grows and then 
in letters of fire every where every 
where is written dora dora 
dora 

it was a fearful spectacle to see 
that strong man with his imposing fi 
gure raised to its full stature and his 
thoughtful brow lit up with an ex 
pression of idiotic wonder as standing 
on the verge of the secret door he 
pointed wildly at the blood-red picture 
which his fancy had drawn in the va 
cant air while his blue eyes dilated 
with a maniac glance and his face 
grew yet more livid and ghastly 

come livingstone cried luke 
gently leading him through the close 

you had better leave this place 
 and yet dora is sleeping here 

my young wife the mother of my 
children do ye think luke that 
i d have believed you last thursday 
morning if you had then told me 
this livingstone this day-week 
you will leave a chamber in a brothel

the dishonor 



 



chapter fifteenth lt 

the dishonor 

all was silent within the rose 
chamber for a single moment that j 
pale visage glared from the crimson j 
hangings concealing the entrance to 
the walnut room and then with aj 
measured footstep byrnewood arling 
ton advanced along the floor his 
countenance ghastly as the face of 
lazarus at the very instant when in 
obedience to the words of the incar 
nate life struggled with corruption and 
death over his cheek and brow 

bring home to your mind the scene 
when lazarus lay prostrate in the 
grave a stiffened corse his face all 
clammy with corruption the closed 
eyes surrounded by loathsome circles 
of decay the cheeks sunken and the 
lips fallen in let the words of jesus 
ring in your ears lazarus come 
forth and then as the blue eyelids 
slowly unclose as the gleam of life 
shoots forth from the glassy eye as 
the flush of health struggles with the 
yellowish hue of decay along each 
cheekas life and death mingling in that 
face for a single moment maintain a 
fearful combat for the mastery then i 
pray you gaze upon the visage of 
byrnewood arlington and mark how 
like it is to the face of one arisen from 
the dead a ghastly face on whose 
fixed outline the finger-traces of cor 
ruption are yet visible from whose 
eyes the film of the grave is not yet 
passed away 

the gaze of byrnewood as he 
strode from the entrance of the wal 
nut chamber was riveted to the floor 
had the eyes of the rattlesnake gleam- 
el from the carpet slowly drawing its 



victim to his ruin byrnewood could 
not have fixed his gaze upon the ob 
ject in the centre of the floor with a 
more fearful and absorbing intensity 

there thrown prostrate on the 
gaudy carpet insensible and motion 
less the form of mary arlington lay 
at the brother s feet 

he sank silently on his knees 

he took her small white hand 
now cold as marble within his own 
he swept the unbound tresses back 
from her paliid brow her eyes were 
closed as in death her lips hung apart 
the lower one trembling with a scarce 
ly perceptible movement her cheek 
was pale as ashes with a deep red tint 
in the centre 

byrnewood uttered no sound nor 
shrieked forth any wild exclamation 
of revenge or wo or dispair he 
silently drew the folds of the night- 
robe round her form and veiled her 
bosom but a moment agone warmed 
into a glow by the heart s fires now 
paled by the fingers of the ravisher 
he veiled her fair young bosom from 
the light 

it was a sad sight to look upon 
that face so fair and blooming but a 
moment past now pale as death with 
spot of burning red on the centre of 
each cheek that bosom a moment 
since heaving with passion now still 
and motionless those delicate hands 
with tiny fingers which had bravely 
fought for honor for virtue for purity 
an instant ago now resting cold and 
stiffened by her side 

thick tresses of dark brown hair 
hung round her neck with that 
same careful movement of his hand 
byrnewood swept them aside along 
the smooth surface of that fair neck 



 



the merchant s daughter 



like seme noisome reptile trailing 
over a lovely flower a large vein 
black and distorted shot upward 
darkening the glossy skin while it 
told the story of the maiden s dishonor 
and shame 

 my sister was the solitary ex 
clamation that broke from byrne- 
wood s lips as he gazed upon the form 
of the unconscions girl and his large 
dark eye dilating as he spoke glanced 
around with an expression of strange 
meaning 

he raised her form in his arms and 
kissed her cold lips again and again 
no tear trickled from his eyelids no 
sigh heaved his bosom no deep mut 
tered execration manifested the agita 
tion of his soul 

my sister he again whisperedand 
gathered her more close to his heart 

a slight flush deepening over her 
cheek even while he spoke gave 
signs of returning consciousness 

mary slowly unclosed her eyes and 
gazed with a wandering glance around 
ihe room an instant passed ere she 
discovered that she lay in byrnewood s 
arms 

 oh brother she exclaimed 
not with a wild shriek but in a low- 
toned voice whose slightest accent 
quivered with an emphasis of despair 
 oh brother leave me leave 
me i am not worthy of your touch 
i am vile brother oh most vile 
leave me leave me for i am lost 

 mary whispered byrnewood 
resisting her attempt to unwind his 
arms from her form while the blood 
filling the veins of his throat produced 
an effect like strangulation mary 
do not do not speak thus i 



he could say no more but his face 
dropped on her cold bosom and the 
tears which he had silently prayed for 
came at last 

he wept while that low choakinj 
noise sounding in his throat that in 
voluntary heaving of the chest tha 
nervous quivering of the lip all be 
tokened the strong man wrestling witfr 
his agony 

 do not weep for me brother 
she said in the same low-toned voice 
i am polluted brother and am 
not worthy of the slightest tear you 
shed for me unwind your arms 
brother do not resist me for the 
strength of despair is in these hands 
unwind your arms and let me no 
longer pollute you by my touch 

there was something fearful in the 
xpression of her face as she spoke 
ihe was no longer the trembling child 
whose young face marked the inexpe 
rience of her stainless heart a new i 
world had broken upon her soul not a 
world of green trees silver streams 
and pleasant flowers but a chaos of 
ashes and mouldering flame a lurid 
sky above a blasted soil below and 
one immense horizon of leaden clouds 
hemming in the universe of desolation 

she had sprung from the maiden 
nto the woman but a blight was on 
her soul forever the crime had not 
only stained her person with dishonor 

t like the sickening warmth of the 
hot-house it had forced the flower of 
her soul into sudden and unnatural 
maturity it was the maturity of pre 
cocious experience in her inmost 
soul she felt that she was a dishonored 
hing whose very touch was pollution 
whose presence among the pure and 
stainless would be a bitter mockery 



the dishonor 



 



and foul reproach the guilt was not 
hers but the ruin blasted her purity 
forever 

 unwind your arms my brother 
she exclaimed tearing herself from his 
embrace with all a maniac s strength 
i am polluted you are pure 
oh do not touch me do not touc-h 
me leave me to my shame oh 
leave me 

she unwound her form from his 
embrace and sank crouching into a 
corner of the rose chamber extend 
ing her hands with a frightened ges 
ture as though she feared his slightest 
touch 

 mary shrieked byrnewood fling 
ing his arms on high with a move 
ment of sudden agitation oh do 
not look upon me thus come to me 
oh mary come to me for i am 
your brother 

the words the look and the trem 
bling movement of his outspread arms 
all combined acted like a spell upon 
the intellect of the ruined girl she 
rose wildly to her feet as though im 
pelled by some invisible influence and 
fell tremblingly into her brother s arms 

while one dark and horrible thought 
was working its way through the ave 
nues of his soul he gathered her to 
his breast again and again 

and in that moment of silence and 
unutterable thought the curtains lead 
ing into the painted chamber were 
slowly thrust aside and lorrimer 
again appeared upon the scene strick 
en with remorse he had fled with 
a madman s haste from the scene 
of his crime and while his bosom was 
torn by a thousand opposing thoughts 
he had endeavored to drown the voice 
within him and crush the memory of 



the nameless wrong it was all in 
vain impelled by an irresistible de- 
sire to look again upon the victim of 
his crimehe re-entered the rose cham 
ber it was a strange sight to see 
the brother kneeling on the floor as 
he gathered his sister s form in his 
arms and yet the seducer gave 
no sign nor indication of surprise 

a fearful agitation was passing over 
the libertine s soul as unobserved by 
the brother or sister he stood gazing 
upon them with a wandering glance 
his face so lately flushed with pas 
sion in its vilest hues was now palest 
and livid his white lips trembled 
with a nervous moment and his hands 
extended on either side clutched va 
cantly at the air as though he wrestled 
with an unseen foe 

while the thought of horror was 
slowly darkening over byrnewood s 
soul a thought as dark and horrible 
gathered like a phantom over the mind 
of lorrimer 

a single word of explanation will 
make the subsequent scene clear and 
intelligible to the reader 

from generation to generation the 
family of the lorrimer s had been r a 
subject to an aberration of intellect as jjj 
sudden as it was terrible always re 
sulting from any peculiar agitation of 
mind which might convulse the soul 
with an emotion remarkable for its 
power or energy it was a hallucina 
tion a temporary madness a sudden 
derangement of intellect it always 
succeeded an uncontrollable outburst 
of anger or grief or joy from fa 
ther to son since the family had first 
come over to pennsylvania with the 
proprietor and peace-maker william 
penn this temporary derangement ofj 



iygt 




 



the merchant s daughter 



intellect had descended as a fearful 
heritage 

lorrimer had been subject to this 
madness but once in his life when 
his father s corse lay stiffened before 
his eyes and now as he stood ga 
zing upon the form of the brother and 
sister lorrimer felt this temporary 
madness stealing over his soul in the 
form of a strange hallucination while 
he became conscious that in a single 
moment the horror which shook his 
frame would rise to his lips in words 
of agony and fear 

u raise your hands with mine to 
heaven mary exclaimed byrne- 
wood as the thought which had been 
working over his soul manifested its 
intensity in words raise your 
hands with mine and curse the author 
of your ruin lift your voice with 
mine up to the god who beheld the 
wrong who will visit the wronger 
with a doom meet for his crime 
lift your voice with mine and curse 
him 

 oh byrnewood do not do not 
curse him the wrong has been done 
but do not i beseech you visit his head 
with a curse 

 hear me oh god before whom 
i now raise my hands in the vow of 
justice in life i will be to this wretch 
as a fate a doom a curse 

i am vile oh god steeped in 
the same vices which blacken the 
heart of this man cankered by the 
same corruption but the office which 
i now take on myself raising this 
right hand to thee in witness of my 
fixed purpose would sanctify the dark 
est fiend in hell i am the avenger 
of my sister s wrong she was in 
nocent sne was pure she trusted and 



was betrayed i will avenge her 
before thee i swear to visit v her wrong 
upon the head of her betrayer with u 
doom never to be forgotten in the me 
mory of man this right hand i de 
dicate to this solemn purpose come 
what will come what may let danger 
threaten or death stand in my path 
through sickness and health through 
riches or poverty i now swear to hold 
my steady pathway onward my only 
object in life the avengement of rny 
sister s wrong he shall die by this 
hand oh god i swear it by thy 
name i swear it by my soul i 
swear it by the fiend who impelled 
the villian to this deed of crime 

as he whispered forth this oath in 
a voice which speaking from the depths 
of his chest had a hollow and sepul 
chral sound the fair girl flung herself 
on his breast and with a wild shriek 
essayed to delay the utterance of the 
curse by gathering his face to her 
bosom 

for a moment her efforts were suc 
cessful lorrimer had stood silent 
and pale while the deep-toned 
voice of byrnewood arlington break- 
ing in accents of doom upon his ear 
had aided and strengthened the strange 
hallucination which was slowly gather 
ing over his brain like a mighty spell 

 there is a wide river before me 
its broad waves tinged with the last 
red rays of a winter sunset such 
were the words he murmured extend 
ing his hand as though pointing to the 
scene which dawned upon his soul 
 a wide river with its waves surging 
against the wharves of a mighty city 
afar i behold steeples and roofs and 
towers all glowing in the beams of thft 
setting sun and as i gaze the waves

the dishonor 



 



turn to blood red and ghastly blood 
and now the sky is a-flame and the 
clouds sweep slowly past bathed in the 
same crimson hue all is blood 
the river rushes before me and the sky 
and the city all pictured in colors 
of blood 

 an invisible hand is leading me to 
my doom there is death for me 
in yonder river and i know it yet 
down down to the rivers banks down 
down into the red waters i must go 
ha ha tis a merry death the 
blood- red waves rise above me high 
er higher higher yonder is the city 
yonder the last rays of the settrng sun 
glitter on the roof and steeple yonder 
is the blood-red sky and ah i tell 
ye i will not die you shall not sink 
me beneath these gory waves devil 
is not your vengeance satisfied must 
you feast your eyes with the sight of 
my closing agonies must your hand 
grasp me by the throat and your foot 
trample me beneath the waves i tell 
you i will not will not die 

 ha ha ha here s purty 
going s on laughed the hoarse voice 
of devil-bug as his hideous form ap 
peared in the doorway of the walnut 
chamber with his attendant negroes 
at his back seems the gal helped 
him off there he sits the ornery 
feller with his sister in his arms 
while gusty is a-doin some ravin s 
on his own indivdooal hook come 
here glow-worm here musquito 



come here my pets and tend to this 
leetle family party 

in another instant the rose cham 
ber became the scene of a strange 
picture 

byrnewood had arisen to his feet 



the hallucination which possessed his 
brain the handsome libertine stood 
in the centre of the room his form di 
lating to its full stature his face the 
hue of ashes while with his hazel eyes 
glaring on vacancy he clutched wild 
ly at the air starting backward tit ths 
same moment as though some invisi 
ble hand was silently impelling him 
to the brink of the blood -red river 
which rolled tumultuously at his feet 
which slowly gathered nround him 
which began to heave upward to his 
very lips 

on one side in a half-kneeling po 
sition crouched mafy arlington her 



large blue eyes 



from her 



pallid face as with her upraised hands 
crossed over her bosom she gazed 
upon the agitated countenance of the 
seducer with a glance of mingled awe 
and wonder while on the other side 
stern and erect byrnewood with his 
pale visage daikening in a settled r 
frown with one foot advanced and his 
hand upraised seemed about to strike 
the libertine to the floor 

in the background rendered yet 
more hideous by the dimness of the 
scene devil-bug stood grinning in 
derisive triumph as he motioned his 
attendants the herculean negroes to 
advance and secure their prey 

there was silence for a single mo 
ment lorrimer still stood clutching 
at the vacant air mary still gazed 
upon his face in awe byrnewood yet 



in his meditated blow while 
devil-bug with musquito and glow 
worm at his back seemed quietly en 
joying the entire scene as he glanced 
from side to side with his solitary eye 
 unhand me i will not die 
hile lorrimer stood spell-bound by shrieked lorrimer as he fancied thai

phantom hand gathering tightly round 
his throat while the red waters swept 
surging to his very lips i will not 
die i defy ah ah you strangle 
me 

 the hour of your death has come 
you have said it and it shall be so 
whispered byrnewood advancing a 
single step as his dark eye was fixed 
upon the face of lor rimer while 
your own guilty heart spreads a blood- 
red river before your eyes this hand 
no phantom hand shall work 
your death 

he sprang forward while a shriek 
arose from mary s lips he sprang 
forward with his eye blazing with ex 
citement and his outspread hand 
ready for the work of vengeance but 
as he sprang the laugh of devil-bug 
echoed at his back and the sinewy 
arms of the negroes gathered suddenly 
round his form and flung him as sud 
denly to the floor 

 here s fine goin s on exclaim 
ed devil-bug as he glanced from 
face to face a feller who s been a 
leetle too kind to a gal stands a-makin 
speeches at nothin the gal kneels 
on tho carpet as though she were a

sells his cusses for nothin here s 
a tea party for ye 

 what does all this mean devil- 
bug exclaimed lorrimer in his 
usual voice as the hallucination passed 
from him like a dream leaving him 
utterly unconscious of the strange 
vision which had a moment since ab 
sorbed his very soul what does 
all this mean ha byrnewood and 
mary i remember you are her

wood with a ghastly smile as he en- 
deavoured to free himself from the

chapter first 



pitz-cowles at home 



scene changes to a chamber 
id the fourth story of the tox hotel 
which arises along chestnut street a 
monster-building with some hundred 
windows varying its red-brick face 
in the way of eyes covered with green- 
blind shutters looking very much like 
so many goggles intended to preserve 
the sight of the visual organs aforesaid 
while the verandah on the ground 
floor affording an entrance to the bar 
room might be likened to the mouth 
of the grand-edifice always wide open 
and ready to swallow a customer 

the sunshine of a cold clear win 
ter morning was streaming dimly be 
tween the half-closed inside shutters 
of the small chamber on the fourth 
story the faint light pouring be 
tween the shutters of the two win 
dows looking to the south served to 
reveal certain peculiar characteristics 
of the place 



there was a dressing bureau sur 
mounted by a hanging mirror stand 
ing between the two windows of the 
chamber along the marble top of 
the bureau were disposed various bot 
tles of perfumes whose strong scent 
impregnated the atmosphere with re 
markable reminiscences of musk and 
orange and lemon and patchovlly 
a pair of well-used kid gloves which 
had been white yesterday a rumpled 
black scarf j a play bill figured off 
with intoxicated letters displaying the 
entertainment at the walnut street 
theatre the night before and a glit 
tering bowie knife side by side with 
its silver sheath 

all over the carpet were scattered 
windsor chairs either grouped in cir 
cles as though they were talking about 
the various gentry who had reposed on 
their well-cushioned seats or fixed in 
strange positions along the walls itke 
waiters at a party overburdened with 
coats and vests and stocks and other 
articles of apparel thrown carelessly 

 



 



the forger 



over their rounds or yet again flung 
down on the floor with their heels in 
the air as though they had taken a 
drop too much and didn t know how 
to get up again 

there was a large sofa on one side 
of the room a coal fire blazing in the 
grate opposite while in the dim dis 
tance you might perceive the outlines 
of a bed and hear the deep bass of a 
heavy snore which held a concert of 
its own within the closely drawn cur 
tains 

altogether that entire room located 
in the fourth story of the ton house 
said as plainly as a room can say 
that somebody had come home very late 
last night or very early this morning 
most probably in liquor and called 
up as witnesses to this interesting asser 
tion the chairs thrown disorderly 
about the floor the gloves and bowie 
knife on the dressing bureau the hat 
on the sofa and the heavy snore with 
in the bed 

sitting in the blaze of light stream 
ing between the aperture of the half- 
closed shutters was a small creole 
boy whose slight yet perfectly pro 
portioned form was perched on the 
edge of a windsor chair as with his 
legs crossed and his hair flung back 
from his tawny face the young gen 
tleman was briskly engaged in elabo 
rating a fashionable boot into the re 
quisite degree of polish 

the boy was eminently handsome 
his face was a light brown in hue 
yet perfectly regular in every feature 
his complexion clear as a ripe seckel 
pear his lips red as may cherries 
his eyebrows penciled and arching 
and his eyes full large and black 
brilliant as diamonds and glittering 



as icicles long curling hair mark 
ed by that peculiar jet black tinged 
with a shade of deep blue which de 
signates the child of white and african 
parents fell waving around his neck 
and face in stiffened locks resem 
bling in their texture the mane of a 
horse his form light springy and 
agile was the ideal of a creole cupid 
not an outline too large or too small 
not the slightest disproportion visible 
in a single limb with small feet and 
delicate hands a waist as lithe as a 
willow and a hollow in the back like 
a bow gently bent the creole was al 
together one of the most beautiful 
things ever fashioned by the hand of 
nature 

he was a pretty child and yet his 
large black eyes had something in 
their glance which spoke of a pre 
cocious intimacy with the vices and 
intrigues of manhood 

 massa tole dim to polish dat boot 
until he see his face in de morroc- 
cor muttered the young gentle 
man brushing away at the glittering 
leather dim can see his nose and 
his two eyes in de boot but the mouth 
aint not perfect stop a minnit i 
bring dat feature out ha ha hah 

it was a pleasure to hear the little 
fellow talk there was such a delicate 
accent lingering on his words and 
his laugh not at all similar to the 
usual african guffaw was a quiet 
chuckle which rolled lusciously in his 
mouth like a delicious morsel whose 
sweetness he wished to enjoy at leisure 

tink i shall hab to discharge 
vfassa debbil of a flare-up tween 
me and him some day when i tells 
him l l dont want you any more you 
sah you kin take dem wages and

de lookin -glasses heart i tells you 
till broke ob day kep dim a-waitin 
and den tumbles into bed widout so 
much as giving de chile a-quataw 
oh de high-golly 

this appeal to master endymion s 
favorite saint the high-golly sup 
posed to be some imaginary deity 
created by the fertile fancy of the 
young creole was occasioned by a sud 
den mishap with the boot which resent 
ing a vigorous push of the brush slip 
ped out of his hands and went spin 
ning across the room 

 wonder if the debbil aint in dat 
morroccor i jis does nebber see

was to set dat boot at de head of the

and in obedience to this request 
endymion flung back the shutters 
and the full glare of the sunlight pour- 
ed into the room the owner of the 
voice and snore heard from within 
the curtains sprung from the bed and 
assuming the dressing gown advan 
ced toward the windows 

col fitz-cowles the handsome co 
lonel fitz-cowles stood revealed in 
the light his dark-hued face looking 
somewhat worn and haggard around 
the eyes while his slender form at- 
tired in the rainbow morning-gown 
and close fitting drawers though well 
proportioned and graceful in its out 
lines by no means displayed that per 
fection of symmetry which distin 
guished the person of the millionaire 
in broad daylight along chesnut 
street for instance the colonel was 
thicker around the waist thinner about 
the hips smaller in the region of the 
calves than was usual with him when 
arrayed in full dress his face was 
very pale and his cheeks lacked that 
deep vermillion tint which gave such 
life to his dusky countenance at the 
evening party or the afternoon parade

colonel bestowing a gentle hint upon

razor in hand fitz-cowles stooped 
to the floor and drew from beneath

looked as if it had been through all

the battle of waterloo it was so bat

dim looked up into the scowling 
face of his master with a glance of 
perfect calmness the brow of fitz- 
cowles was disfigured by a hideous 
frown and his entire countenance 
wore an expression characteristic of a 
low bully who has been accustomed 
to the vilest haunts in the most cor 
rupt cities of the south dim was 
used to these sudden outbursts of pas 
sion when his master dropping his 
gentlemanly repose of manner was 
wont to stand before him with his 
bowie knife in hand while with a 
threatening tongue and sullen brow he 
bade him reveal the things he had seen 
and the words he had heard if he dared

about your gold mines quite the 
thing ensemble de chose as we say 
in domestic french 

as he spoke buzby poodle esq 
tood bowing and scraping in the cen 



tre of the vacant space of carpet ex 
tending before the breakfast cable 
buzby poodl wasn t handsome not 
precisely he was a little thickset 
man with a short heavy body shaped 
something like a pine-knot and irre 
gular legs fashioned like a pair of in 
verted parentheses or like a pair of 
sickles with their backs placed to 
gether it must be confessed that his 
legs were deplorably knock-kneed near 
ly acquainted with each other at the 
knees and quite distant in their inter 
course at the feet buzby s feet were 
not small douzzle the bootmaker has 
been heard to say with evident pain 
that he would just as soon make slip 
pers for a young hippopotamuses boots 
for buzby you could not positively 
say that buzby s hands were small or 
delicate or decently aristocratic very 
short in the fingers and very thick 
across the palm and back buzby s 
hands reminded you of a terrapin s 
fin they were such peculiar hands 

buzby s face wasn t handsome it 
may have been expressive or intel 
lectual but it was not handsome 
looking upon his countenance you 
were aware of the presence of a saffron 
lump of flesh with a small projection 
in the centre for a nose a delicate 
gash below this projection for a mouth 
and two faint stripes of whity-brown 
hair in the way of eyebrows his 
eyes looking from beneath the brows 
without the intervention of anything 
you might call an eyelid had a deplo 
rable half-cooked appearance very 
much like the visual organs of a salt 
mackerel roasting on the griddle a 
delicate strand of forehead about half 
an inch in width was agreeably re 
lieved by a dense thicket of curly

 own hair there were mysterious 
rumors about town with regard to this 
luxuriant hair several of buzby s 
intimates had been observed to smile 
when the ladies complimented him on 
his delightful curls pettitoes the wig 
maker always grew mysterious when 
poodle s head of hair was called in 
question and once but that was on 
a drinking party when pettitoes in 
tellects were muddled he had said 
with a melo-dramatic scowl that 
 there was some people in this ere 
world as stuck emselves up mighty 
high and yet wore dead people s 
hum he wouldn t say what they 
wore but they wore dead people s 
hum he could tell what 

the general contour of his face was 
so singular and to use a word 
which he delighted to repeat on every 
occasion so unique that coddle st 
giles the celebrated miniature painter 
who having been honored with the 
patronage of queen victoria had 
painted the whole royal family from 
her majesty down to the lap-dog 
said with a painful grimace that he 
had never experienced such extraordi 
nary feelings as came over him when 
pourtraying buzby on costly ivory 
but once before in his life and that 
to use coddle s delicious cockney dia 
lect wos when the royal mena 
geries had visited my native town 
and i ad the extr onery aonor to de 
pict the lineaments of the female hou- 
rang-houtang 

altogether buzby poodle esq 
was an extraordinary man some 
thing out of the common run of men 
a specimen of that high pressure style 
tgtf editorial genius which the quaker 



city admires and loves to the bottom 
of its universal heart 

like that hint about your gold 
mines eh curnel observed buz- 
by flinging his cloak on a chair and 
seating himself beside the breakfast 
table nice steak for breakfast 
quite recherche as we say in 
french don t care if i do take a 
pull with you get me a plate 
dim 

why buzby this will do yes 
certainly observed fitz-cowles 
stirring his spoon in the coffee while 
he glanced over the pages of the dai 
ly black mail -but what a bad 
smell your paper has quite an odor 
the patchoully dim now get a 
plate for count common sewer 

 you are so jocular exclaimed 
buzby with a pleasant laugh you 
have such a quantity of fun about you 
count common sewer ha ha

 yes buzby but you must touch 
em up to-morrow about the mysteri 
ous stranger at the ton house sup

boy

taking up fitz-cowles s toast be 
tween his fingers it takes me r 
pris moi as we say in domestic 
french 

now buzby exclaimed fitz- 
cowles fixing his dark eyes on the 
unmeaning face of the editor with a 
look that made the little fellow trem 
ble in his shoes you know i pay 
you well for these little advei tise- 
ments as a matter of course vou

little knowledge very little but you 
might use it some day to my injury 
what security have i that you will not 

do so 

 what security good heaven s 
gurnet cried buzby rising from his 
chair can you suspect me this 
is too much and poodle s voice 
grew quite pathetic why curnel 
to show what are my feelings toward 
you i will now place myself com 
pletely in your power 

as how 

buzby made no reply but striding 
with a cautious step to every door in 
the room he assured himself that they 
were fast locked and secured and 
then with an air of the deepest mys 
tery approached fitz-cowles and ga 
zed steadily in his face 

 what the d do you mean 
exclaimed fitz-cowles as he observed 
the boiled mackerel eyes fixed upon 
his countenance 

 there there i m in your power 
the secret s out nobody knows it 
but myself and wife now you know 
it too you can ruin me if you like 

 what in the d do you mean 

 why why exclaimed buzby 
fingering away at his curly hair 
wear a wig 

ha ha ha roared fitz- 
cowles as poodle stood before him 
holding his head of hair in his hand 
 ha ha ha count common 
sewer you do look like old jocko the 
wonderful ape whom they exhibited 
some time ago at the masonic hall 
oh jupiter i shall die ha ha 
ha that head that head 

it was not the most solemn sight 
in the world there stood buzby 



calm and solemn his luxuriant head 
of hair extended in his right hand 
while the outline of his real head 
clothed with a short wiry stubble of 
real hair became painfully distinct 
in the light of the morning sun 

 and how is this to place you in 
my power asked fitz-cowles aflei 
his laughter had subsided to a quiet 
chuckle oh jupiter that head 
buzby do put on your wig or you ll 
drive me into convulsions 

 how is this to place me in your 
power exclaimed poodle in a half- 
offended tone as he resumed his curly 
head of hair would i figure so 
largely behind the scenes of the thea 
tre if the ballet girls knew i wore a 
wig curse it the very supes would 
laugh at me and the scene-shiflers 
would not hesitate to jeer me fitz- 
cowles it may seem foolish to you 
who have no such feelings of a tender 
nature but but my whole existence 
is wound up in that head o hair 

the deuce it is why poodle you 
didn t know that it was flung into my 
plate last night at monk-hall did 
you 

 was it though then i must 
have been drunk exclaimed buzby 
with a look of the deepest mortifica- 
tion that accounts for the peculiar 
sticky state of my hair this morn 
ing you think any of the fellows 
noticed it 

 too drunk for that buzby by- 
the-bye you must have had a great 
many tender adventures in your time 
eh poodle 

 hallo massa open dis here 
door the voice of endymion who 
had been down stairs in search cf a 



fitz-cowles at hom 



 



plate for buzby was heard in the en 
try ihabgot de plate for com 
mon sewer 

in a moment the door was opened 
and dim entered with a plate and some 
additional refreshments which hav 
ing been placed upon the table fitz- 
cowles and buzby resumed their 
breakfast 

 tender adventures cried poo 
dle masticating a piece of toast as he 
dropped his knife and fork d ye 
see that 

he drew a small pocket bible from 
his bosom as he spoke and displayed 
it complacently before the eyes of the 
astonished fitz-cowles it was cor 
pulent with letters inserted between the 
leaves like so many anchovies be 
tween various thin slices of bread-and- 
butter 

 this rather goes a-head of the 
wig what may it mean buzby 

 don t you see i keep all my love 
letters in the bible ah me if 
wasn t married well well it can t 
be helped but these letters might 
tell a strange tale 

 let them tell it by all means 
observed fitz-cowles and buzby push 
ing his chair back from the table 
and displaying his legs very wide 
apart laid the pocket bible on one 
knee and commenced a soliloquy 
something after the fashion 

 that s from a delightful creature 
curnel he observed turning over 
one of the leaves of the bible and ex 
tracting a letter she loves me of 
course i had to be complaisant fain 
heart never won fair lady le cur 
ennvye ne jamais pas engage la 
belle blanche as we say in french 
that s from a vocalist that from an 



actress and that ah curnel there s 
a mystery about it 

how so 

 it s from an unknown lady pve 
tried to find out her name through the 
lerks of the post office gt but in vain 
she s a southern planter s daughter 
curnel rich beautiful just seven 
teen offers me her hand don t 
know i m booked ah me it would 
make the tears come into your eyes 
if i was to read this letter there o  
nel is a lock of her hair 

and buzby with a look of subdued 
melancholy slowly unfolded the letter 
and held up in the sunlight a lock of 
reddish brownish hair which long 
and slender looked amazingly like a 
patent whip lash 

fitz-cowles preserved the gravity 
of his face with considerable difficulty 
while the creole endymion who 
stood at poodle s shoulder placed his 
hands alternately to his mouth and 
the pit of his stomach as though he 
was suffering under intermitting at 
tacks of the cholera and toothache 

buzby sate in the full light of the 
morning sun holding the lock of hair 
extended in his right hand while his 
other hand absently grasped the pocket 
bible 

you see she is a noble girl 
he exclaimed gazing fixedly upon the 
lock of hair with a glance of painful 
melancholy loves me spoke of 
my early struggles in her letter 
asked me if the world hadn t been 
hard with me if the iron grasp of 
persecution hadn t been on my 
shoulder ever since the days of slips 
and pap-spoons if it didn t gall me 
considerable to think my genius wasn 
appreciated if 



j 



the forger 



buzby paused and with a look of 
tender melancholy jerked the pinkish 
lock of hair up and down as a carter 
 cracks his whip 

the action was too much for fitz- 
cowles he burst into a roar of laugh 
ter while dim the creole went rolling 
over the floor holding his hands to 
his side as though he was laboring 
under an epileptic fit 

 curse me if i see any reason for 
laughing in this manner exclaimed 
buzby rising angrily from his seat 
 that s a very singular boy of yours 
curnel d n him he lays there 
wriggling like a snake 

ha ha ha this is too 
good roared fitz-cowles of 
course i had no hand in writing that 
letter he muttered to himself 
 get up dim and behave yourself 

 massa dis quite convulses us 
it does he he he exclaimed dim 
rising to his feet massa didn t send 
me to the barber nor nothing to buy 
dat hair he chuckled in a whisper 
inaudible to buzby s ears dim 
didn t take de letter to de pos offis 
de high-golly 

 this is quite a tender affair 
n est une affaire tendre as we say 
in domestic french exclaimed 
buzby resuming his seat with this 
sentiment in his peculiarly detestable 
french ton honor curnel it s 
a fact the girl the unknown 
loves me devotedly i should sup 
pose that she read my paper how 
d ye feel after the bruise last night 

 capital i intend to have some 
fun this morning you see my go 
vernor hasn t sent me the usual quar 
terly remittance my creditors have 
been hunting me down for the last 



fortnight i have been aitacked in th 
street assaulted in the theatre be- 
seiged in my hotel as a last resort 
i appointed a day for each of them to 
call and see me and even named the 
hour of course each creditor is ig 
norant of the fact that i have made 
the same appointment with every one 
of his fellow blood-suckers it hap 
pens to-day at ten o clock in the next 
room this glorious family party 

ha ha ha laughed buzby 
poodle this beats some insolvent 
schedules quite hollow i say some 
because i ve had a little business in 
that line myself out of curiosity 
mind ye only from curiosity i have 
looked over some of the schedules in 
the court devoted to such interesting 
affairs 

 and you discovered something 
rich i s pose 

 the old proverb says a man is 
known by the company he keeps 
comprenez-vous un homme par ses 
compagnons du voyage as we say 
in domestic french now i m of 
the opinion that a man is known by 
his insolvent schedule there s a 
schedule filed in the proper court 
under the delicate nose of their honors 
which says queer things for the char 
acter of its signer one day he went 
round town the jolly dog getting 
seven coats on credit mind ye 
from seven tailors rings from this 
jeweller and breast-pins from that 
boots by the quantity and hats by the 
half-dozen in short there was scarce- 
ly a store in chesnut street that he 
didn t do not a credulous merchant 
ha ha ha but was diddled by him 
on this remarkable day 

 well well what was the result v 



fitz-cowles at home 



 



 one day like a clock he went 
exclusively on tick the next day the 
clock stopped going it was wound up 
to some considerable extent the 
creditors look blue their friend and 
pitcher took the bankrupt law 

 de high-golly by de way dat 
chap tells de story one ud think he 
did all dat his ownsef ha hah 

 buzby your paper must make 
you some considerable amount of 
t argent how d ye manage the 
lt daily black mail 

this question appealed to the no 
blest sympathies of poodle s heart he 
rose slowly from his seat he glanced 
round with an expression of conde 
scending pride and his face became 
radiant with a sudden enthusiasm 

how do i manage the daily 
black mail v he exclaimed extend 
ing his right fin in the manner of a 
stump-orator who wishes to enrapture 
a mass meeting consisting of a few 
dirty boys one loafer and two small 
dogs i do it a little in the footpad 
line a big motto at the paper s head 
 fiat justitia you know the 
rest do i want the cash i stick 
in an article charging some vell- 
knogtvn citizen with theft or seduction 
or some more delightful crime citizen 
comes down in a rage wants the 
article contradicted in next day s 
paper he pays for the contradiction 
of course i have known a mere on 
dit that so-and-so had committed a 
 hideous crime to bring me in as 
much as a cool hundred at a lick 

 how do you manage to acquire 
so much favor with the sex 

take the theatre for instance 
a new actress appears suppose her 
virtuous or silly i make advances 



she foolishly rebels me vey ikely 
calls me a puppy next day an 
on dit appears in black mail head 
ed licentiousness of the stage and 
embracing some compassionate allu 
sion to the lady aforesaid you un 
derstand i damage her reputation 
by a paragraphical slur 

 and she capitulates 

 sometimes and sometimes she 
don t but i keep up this delightful 
fire of genteel insinuations delicate 
allusions and spicy on dits if the 
girl s character is ruined it isn t my 
fault i m sure 

 it s quite refreshing to hear you 
talk in this way are not times pretty 
dull with you now 

 oh lord es hasn t been a 
suicide for a week not even a mur 
der down town nor a nigger baby 
killed i do wish something lively 
would spring up for christmas now 
an abduction case with the proper 
trimmings would go it with a rush i 
allez avec une furie as we say in 
domestic french 

 how d ye stand with the other 
papers 

 guess when i tell you one 
slight circumstance they regard 
my paper as a sort of literary galleys 
in which every aspirant for fame must 
serve his time an author who has 
once been connected with my sheet is 
regarded as a convict all his life by 
the rest of the world newspaporial 
good phrase that 

u d ye edit your paper by your 
self 

 bless you no i know a trick 
worth two o that je comprend un 
artifice double-la as we say in do 
mestic french whenever i find an

author vn extreme distress rather 
out of pocket you know i take 
him into my office give him a dog s 
salary and make him do a dog s 
work 

 dog s work indeed if he as 
sists in getting up your paper was 
the murmured remark of fitz-cowles 

should he leave me and they 
always do leave me after a month or 
so i libel him on every occasion 
and talk about ingratitude ha ha 
ha but the poor devil can never get 
rid of the crime of having been con 
nected with my paper that sticks 
to him like original sin to a puri 
tan 

 well buzby you have given me 
some fresh ideas about newspapers 
observed fitz-cowles i thought i 
knew them like a book you have 
given me a new wrinkle 

he said this and gazed silently into 
the saffron face of buzby poodle 

oh glorious liberty of the press 
lei us take the opportunity afforded by 
this quiet moment and chaunt a psalm 
in your praise oh glorious press 
what a comfort it must be to you to 
think and feel in your inmost heart 
that buzby poodle who sits smiling in 
yonder chair is no reality no fact 
but a mere fictitious impersonation of 
all the evils which spring around your 
life and darken your existence 

oh magnificent quaker city with 
your warehouses and your churches 
your theatres and your brothels 
your banks and your insane hospitals 
your loan companies and your alms 
houses how delightful to all your de 
nizens must be the reflection that 
buzby poodle s no living nuisance 



but an airy though loathsome creation 
of the author s brain 

nursed from his very infancy in th 
purlieus of the dance-house an asso 
ciate of the ruffian and the courtezan 
from his earliest childhood crawling 
from the pages of his foul journal 
over the fairest reputations in the com- 
munity sneering at the character of 
this man s virtuous wife blasting 
with his leprous pen that man s stain 
less child in his person and soul one 
hideous blot and breathing deformity 
an ulcer cankering over the bosom 
of society a bravo who stabs for his 
dollar a hireling who without cha 
racter without reputation without even 
a name prowls abroad selling his 
sheet to any man that will buy it for 
any purpose under heaven a tolera 
ted infamy an uncaged jail-bird an 

unconvicted felon oh glorious 

quaker city does it not make your 
moral heart grow warm when you 
remember that a creature despica 
ble as this has no existence in fact 
but is only a fancy of the author a 
fiction of his brain 

other cities may have their abo 
minations in the shape of a licentious 
press with marketable editors who 
have in their time pursued every ho 
nest occupation from body-snatching 
up to newspaper publishing but the 
quaker city like the ideal town of 
some far-off el dorado is so pure so 
spotless that an author in search of 
a cut-throat editor by the portraiture 
of whose character he means to throw 
a dark relief around the brighter por 
tions of his pages must set his wits to 
work and invent a buzby poodle 

oh rare invention buzby poodle 
long may it be ere a thing like you

and as the hoarse voice echoed 
through the aperture mr bluffly bulk 
appeared in the doorway driving an 
immense paunch before him as he 
walked along his small head over 
looked his immense corporation like a 
pea observing the circumference of a 
pumpkin

of credulous tradesmen the results 
of this princely style now manifested 
hemselves in the shape of som four- 
and-thirty creditors who came pour-

chapter second 

fitz-cowles and his creditors 

iff a large saloon furnished in a 
style of magnificencepopularly known 
as the gingerbread style with im 
mense red silk curtains along the 
windows scattered patches of gilt 
glittering around the cornices and a 
jolossal mirror above the mantle sate 
he four-and-thirty creditors waiting 
for the appearance of the millionaire 

the softened light which came 
through the drawn curtains gave a 
mild and shadowy effect to the figures 
of the patient band while it was quite 
delightful to witness the animated ex 
pression of their countenances as 
gazing into each others eyes they 
seemed to wonder why in the deuce 
they were all penned up there together 
like various kinds of cattle at an 
agricultural fair

glaring upon the little bootmaker

was engaged in polishing his shoes on 
the handsome hearth-rug oddle st 
giles gazed vacantly around with the 
look of a man who has been feloniously 
decoyed into a den of thieves while 
the rest of the four-and-thirty creditors 
were occupied in examining their 
various bills which they raised fre 
quently in the light and crushed be 
tween their fingers as though the 
 action was productive of great peace 
of mind and tranquility of spirit 

a buz-buz of satisfaction resounded 
through the saloon 

col fitz-cowles appeared in the 
doorway with buzby poodle and en- 
dymion at his back 

 gentlemen said the colonel 
placing one hand between his back 
and his flashy morning-robe while he 
waved the other gently up and down 
 i owe you money 

 that you do muttered bluff 
ly bulk esq stamping his cane on 
the floor and a buz-buz from the four- 
and-thirty creditors confirmed the 
truth of the sentiment it was quite 
pleasing to see how much unanimity 
of feeling existed on this point had 
there been only half the concurrence 
of opinion visible in the doings of most 
of our religious conventions synods 
and conferences the world would have 
been christianized long ago 

 i owe you money and i mean to

a turkey-cock in the face as he fixed 
his eyes upon fitz-cowles who stood 
in the centre of the saloon in an 
attitude of dee t t abstraction be so 
kind as to explain yourself 

yes the plan is feasible ex 
claimed colonel fitz-cowles elevating 
his eyebrows with an absent stare 
 but there s a rough desert to pass 
through before we reach the mines 
plenty of mexicans and texans 
not to mention the indians and wild 
beasts still the mines are productive 
on my father s estate you know i m 
incog just now but when the com 
pany is in full operation under the 
combined patronage of santa anna 
the mexican government and sam 
houston i ll make known the old man s 
name 

sir cried bluffly bulk in a 
voice of thunder will you tell us 
what you mean 

 arrah man and be quick at it 
 oblige us with some slight know- 
ledge 

 guess he wants a straight-jacket 
 tell you what i mean t exclaim 
ed fitz-cowles starting from his re 
verie with pleasure you see

fortunes by allowing you to enter

sident bluffly bulk secretary board 
of directors as follows you can fill 
up the blank at your leisure you know 
 will allow you each to take ten shares 
of the capital stock at per share 
and we will say nothing about the small 
turns i owe you mere trifles you 



know bluffly in consideration of 
the post of secretary being tendered 
you one hundred shares will be the 
smallest number you can be permit 
ted to take 

fitz-cowles paused and looked 
around to note the effects of his im 
portant proposition there was a dead 
silence in the saloon you might have 
heard a pin drop the four and thir 
ty creditors looked into one another s 
faces but said nothing buzby poo 
dle and dim the creole concealed 
themselves among the window cur 
tains which quivered and shook as 
with a sudden convulsion 

 gentlemen d ye like my propo 
sition said fitz-cowles blandly 
 is it feasible we can all go to 
huancatapepetel together times are 
 hard in this city those that are 
married can take their families with 
them those that are single will get 
families soon enough on their arrival 
at the mines you are silent it is 
with surprise i suppose or d ye 
want to advance some small amount 
on your shares no gentlemen i 
can t think of that the trifles i owe 
you one and all will more than pay 
for your shares 

 well may i be rammed inta a 
shot gun and fired off at a nigger riot 
if this is n t the coolest thing i ve 
heard of for some time and as he 
spoke the fat lawyer started from his 
feet and confronted fitz-cowles 
 zounds sir what do you take me 
for 

a fine fat old gentleman re- 
plied fitz-cowles bowing who 
would make a capital superintendent 
of the mines by jupiter bluffly

lability in its every outline it is worth 
at least a-thousand shares to the com- 
pany- 

the storm long-gathering and silent 
in its growth burst suddenly over the 
head of fitz-cowles one and all the 
four and thirty creditors rose one and 
all they poured forth their anger in 
broken words and bitter curses

thirty threatening faces will you 
or will you not am i to be insulted 
in my own house dim go and call 
the servants and have these fellows 
trundled down stairs 

 well sir what do you propose

above the tumult no more hum

with the best feelings in the world to 



combine you one and all into the

 just as you like gentlemen pitch 
huancatepapetel to the devil by all

cowles had not risen even to the dig 
nity of talk of course my little 
fee of fifty dollars will be satisfied out 
of this sum in precedence to all other 
claims

between his teeth

ould manwho was an irishmanand who

and with his clenched hand he 
aimed a blow full at the immense cor 
poration of the fat lawyer the blow 
brushed mumshell s whiskers and took 
effect on the person of the lawyer 
the effect was terrific in an instant 
the four and thirty creditors their bills 
m hand were all mingled through 
each other every man striking the 
man who stood next to him without 
regard to consequences while bluffly 



and flannagan went at it tooth and 
nail exchanging fisticuffs with remark 
able good will 

the scene was peculiar a forest 
of fists rising up and down a mass 
of angry faces all mingled together 
some four and thirty bodies of all 
sizes and descriptions twisting and 
winding about with so much rapidity 
that they all looked like the different 
limbs of some strange monster un 
dergoing a violent epipletic fit

the death warrant 



the mirror which hung above the 
dressing bureau reflected the hand 
some form of col fitz-cowles j 
must be confessed that the colone 
looked decidedly interesting as stand 
ing before the mirror in the glare o 
the morning sun he surveyed his forrr 
for the last time ere he sallied forth 
on chesnut street his figure with 
its broad chest and tapering waist 
was enveloped in a close-fitting over 
coat of dark cloth which falling open 
along the breast disclosed his black 
scarf gathered over his shirt front with 
a plain gold pin and tastefully dis 
posed within the collar of his glossy 
coat and satin vest whose jet black 
hues were in harmony with the other 
portions of his attire 

the dark visage of the colonel 
relieved by long curling locks of jet- 
black hair was surmounted by an 
elegant hat remarkable for its conical 
crown and width of brim this was 
the much admired and very aristocra 
tic l fitz-cowles hat worn by all the 
distinguished bloods of the quaker 
city introduced by the gallant colo 
nel it soon became the rage and was 
at the time of which we write the 
standing test of fashion and elegance 
among the exquisites of chesnut street 
 dim said the colonel gently 
waving the gold-headed cane which 
he held within the white-kid glove of 
his right hand are they all gone 
 all turned out massa de sar- 
ants tumble em down stairs more an 
half- hour ago 

dim continued the colonel 
impregnating his snow-white hand 



kerchief with an additional scent 
of patclwully what s the dmi 
age 

 de looking-glass hove de mantel 
broke in tousan pieces one ob de 
winder curtains torn down de berry 
debbil kicked up all ober de room 
 buzby resumed the colonel 
passing a comb lightly through the 
locks of his jet-black hair how did 
you like it 

 quite recherche but won t they 
sue you for their various debts 

 let them sue and be hanged 
the amount i owe them applied in 
the proper way would command a 
great influence in court why rrnm 
 ve got the price of seven judges ten 
uries and some score of lawyers in 
my pocket these things are all for 
sale 

ha ha this is libellous hello 
there s a knock at the door 
 see who it is dim 
dim opened the door at the extreme 
end of the bed-chamber he gazed 
or an instant through the aperture 
and then closing the door with a sud 
den movement he came running to 
lis master s side his eyes dilating 
vith surprise and his tawny face pale 
is fitz-cowles s white kid gloves 

 what in the deuce is the matter 
dim 

 oh golly massa oh lor oh

bout the room 

 shall i knock you down with the 
hair you scoundrel or would you 



 a perfume once the rage among th 
shionables of our city to the uninitiated 
smells like a composition of musk cast- 
iron filings and bad rain water 



the death warrant 



like to be held oui of a fourth-story 
window by the heels again 

dim approached his master s side 
and whispered in his ear 

the colonel s face grew suddenly 
pale and a blasphemous oath escaped 
from his lips 

 buzby go into the next room 
he cried harshly with the same tone 
he would use in getting rid of a trou 
blesome dog be quick i have a 
visiter whom i must see alone why 
do you stand there staring in my face 
like an idiot begone i say i 
must be alone 

buzby poodle disappeared through 
the saloon door with a look of ma 
lignant anger that boded no good to 
his friend colonel fitz-cowles 

 open the door d ye hear dim 
shouted the colonel as his face grew 
paler and his dark eye emitted a 
clear flashing glance that betokened 
powerful though suppressed emotion 
u show our visiter in 

dim opened the door at the end of 
the bed-chamber farthest from the win 
dows and the visiter entered it must 
foe confessed that the surprise which 
the mere utterance of his name occa 
sioned might be easily explained when 
tfie singular appearance of the new 
comer was taken into consideration 

a short thickset little man dress 
ed in a suit of glossy black cloth ad 
vanced from the open door his face 
which from its remarkable length 
gave you the idea of a horse s head 
affixed to the remnant of a human bo- 
v dy seemed to lay upon his heart 
while his shoulders arose on either 
side as high as his ears and his back 
protruding in a shapeless hump was 
visible above the outline of his head 



his face it is true from its ex 
treme length and the peculiar manner 
in which it seemed to lay on his breast 
might have appeared distorted and de 
formed yet were the features perfectly 
regular the nose a decided aquiline 
the mouth well-proportioned and indi 
cative of firmness the chin full and 
round while the high forehead with 
the dark eyebrows over-arched two 
large and brilliant eyes whose intense 
lustre beaming from a face marked 
by a clear healthy complexion gave 
the beholder the idea that he beheld a 
supernatural rather than a human 
being 

should the latter portion of this des 
cription appear overstrained the rea 
der will remember that the diminutive 
stature of the strange visiter the hump 
on his back and the manner in which 
his face seemed to rest on his chest 
all gave additional effect to the ex 
pression of his face and eyes l jcw 
was written on his face as clearly and 
distinctly as though he had fallen 
asleep at the building of the temple 
at jerusalem in the days of solomon 
the rake and moralist and after a 
nap of three thousand years had 
waked up in the quaker city in a 
state of perfect and hebraic preserva 
tion 

you are here are you whis 
pered fitz-cowles in a tone of ungo 
vernable rage why is this why 
leave your hiding place in broad day 
light 

 pave comsh bekos i vanted to 
comsh said the jew calmly as 
he folded his hands across his breast 

 you have have you whispered 
fitz-cowles as the gleam of rage 
brightened in his dark eyes do 



 



the forger 



you know you dog you miserable 
-jog that i ve a great notion to give 
you a taste of this 

and as he spoke quick as thought 
he flung open the breast of his over 
coat and drawing the bowie knife 
from a secret pocket he brandished it 
above the head of the jew with a look 
of ungovernable hatred 

 puts away te carving-knifes puts 
away te carving-knifes said the 
humpback with a bitter though 
scarcely perceptable sneer you 
vill not hurts noboty 

 perhaps you will tell me why you 
have left your hiding place in broad 
day with all the police at your heels 
ha ha this is delightful curse 
that devil-bug he muttered as he 
strode to the window how could 
he have let this dog escape 

 i tells you vy pave left dat nash- 
ty plashe said the hebrew in the 
coolest manner imaginable bekos 
it vos a nashty plashe bekos dese 
leetle hand do all te vorks andt maybe 
after all you reaps te profit i mosh 
hide in dat hole viles you valksh

jew

vos to sail for europes vot have 
you done left me to rots among 
roppers and tiefs viles you walksh 
cheshnut streets got-tam 

the jew sate down or rather fixed 
himself on the sofa and looked up 
calmly into the flushed countenance 
of fitz-cowles 



 well well von gelt lets shake 
hands and talk the mattter over 

 we may talksh as mosh as we 
pleashes but we tont shake handts 

 just as you like well judos

but gabriel exclaimed fitz- 
cowles in a conciliating tone as he 
seated himself beside the table opposite 
the jew but gabriel you know 
that it is impossible for us to have this 
money for months to come the sov- 
reigns and the notes might be recog 
nized at once it is better to wait a 
little while and make sure of the whole 
sum beyond a chance of detection 
pen and ink dim

as he scrawled a few words a sheet 
of gilt-edged note paper or of 
you was about to observe 

 may be i can git ten tousandt tol- 



the death warrant 



 



ars someveres else said the jew 
with a meaning look 

 ah ha you grow humorous 
gabriel observed fitz-cowles with 
a smile please deliver this little 
note to devil-bug if you should 
chance to see him again before you 
start for europe will you gabby 

ha vot is tish exclaimed the 
hump-backed jew as his eye glanced 
over the note which read as follows 

devil-bug our friend leaves us to 
morrow it is all right aid him as far 
as you can in anything that concerns his 
departure the abbot 

 den you conshents exclaimed 
gabriel with a smile of triumph 
 you vill gif me te monish 

 of course of course you know

gabriel you must be careful though 
gabriel with the money mighty 
careful 

 vot a fool i vos ever to part mit 
it muttered gabriel i hadt it all

 excuse me one moment gabriel 
while i write a note to my jeweller m 
said fitz-cowles with a pleasant 
smile here dim take this ring 
and this note down to melchoir the 
jeweller in fourth street near ches- 
nut hurry back d ye hear 

as he seized the note and folded it 
fitz-cowles gazed smilingly in the 
face of the hebrew but when he 
took the diamond ring from his finger 
and handed it to dim with one quick 
flashing glance of his dark eyes the 
smile deepened into an agreeable 
laugh and fitz-cowles looked for all 
the world like a man whose mind is 
unburdened by a single care ard 



this while his life and brtune hung 
upon the note which he handed to the 
creole 

 dim you understand this 
ring and note are for the jeweller in 
fourth below chesnut 

yes massa answered dim

person ten thousand dollars you can

as the handsome algernon stoop- 
ng to the floor drew the hair trunk 
from beneath the sofa gabriel the 
jew rose from his seat and advanced 
toward the window 

 dere s noting like improvin vons

back at fitz-cowles as he uttered 
this pleasant good-bye 

 farewells ven ve meetsh agin

goot byesh 

he disappeared and in a moment 
was heard passing hurriedly along the 
entry without the bedchamber 

go shrieked fitz-cowles the 
mocnent he had dissappeared go 
and to your death 

he paced hurriedly along the room 
his brow darkening over with a heavy 
frown and his eye blazing with ex 
citement 

 ha the door leading into the 
saloon is ajar could anyone have 
listened to our conversation he 
pushed the door open and glanced 
around the spacious apartment as he 
spoke ha ha there is no one 
in this room what a fool i am to 
fancy a listener near and yet that 
fellow buzby but he s too cowardly 
to betray a man he might muster 
courage to betray a lame nigger 
woman or a sick rag picker but a 
man never 

he closed the door leading into the 
saloon as he spoke 

and as the door was closed the 
form of a man stole softly from the 
folds of the silken window curtains 
and buzby poodle stood disclosed in 
the light his face was very pale 
and his hands trembled like pendulums 
very much out of order 

 here s a secret worth a for 
tune he exclaimed as he passed 
through the saloon door into the wind 
ing entry of the fourth story be 



tray a rag picker indeed ho ho 
what if i betray a forger 

meanwhile fitz-cowles strode swift

chapter fourth 



dora livingstone at 

the boudoir was lighted by two 
long and narrow windows looking to 
the south the morning sunshine 
shone mildly round the place through 
the folds of the thick curtains of light 
silk which hung drooping along the 
windows 

in shape the room was sexagonal 



dora livingstone at home 



with pedestals of dark marble stand 
ing along four of the six walls on 
ihe top of one pedestal stood an ala 
baster vase containing flowers of the 
choicest hues and fragrance gather 
ed from the conservatory which was 
visible through the small door on the 
summit of the second was placed a 
statue of the venus de medici sculp 
tured by a master hand in snow-white 
marble the third supported another 
vase also filled with flowers while 
the top of the fourth was occupied by 
an image of the virgin mary her 
eyes raised upward to heaven and 
her hands clasped over the crucifix 
resting upon her bosom 

the small door leading into the ad 
joining conservatory located in the 
second story of the western wing of 
livingstone s princely mansion hung 
sh ghtly ajar a delightful fragrance 
the breath and sweetness of many 
flowers pervaded the atmosphere 
the perfume of the full-blown rose the 
penetrating scent of the heliotrope the 
delightful odor of the arbor vitoa ming 
ling with the fragrance of a thousand 
other plants and flowers created an air 
of delicious and intoxicating sweetness 

the appointments of the boudoir 
or perhaps closet would be the more 
correct designation were neat and 
classic four handsome gothic chairs 
with worked-cloth seats disposed 
along the walls an elegant sofa placed 
between two of the pedestals a se 
verely-classic table of snow-white 
marble standing opposite all burdened 
with books in costly binding strewn 
over its surface and a gorgeous 
turkey carpet whose deep rich co 
lors were in effective contrast to the 
light and delicate papering of the 



walls all combined produced an effect 
of elegance and taste heightened ana 
refined by the vases of flowers and the 
marble statues presenting beauty in 
the contrasted forms of religion and 
love 

the heat of the conservatory ming 
ling with the sweetness of its flowers 
imparted a fragrant warmth to the 
boudoir no stove nor grate with 
glaring coal or crackling wood was 
therefore needed to render the place 
comfortable 

altogether the entire room was im 
bued with an air of spiritual repose 
of dreamy languor which would have 
been very ethenal indeed if it had not 
been for the presence of the small 
breakfast table which stood in the 
centre of the carpet like a plain and 
stubborn earthly fact with its silver 
coffee-pot porcelain cup and buttered 
toast disposed along the surface of a 
snow-white cloth however the cof 
fee was cold and the toast untasted 
this was something in favor of the 
spirituality of the boudoir 

through the dim light which im 
parted a twilight effect to the room 
you might discern the outlines of a 
woman s form as she lay reclining on 
the sofa her form full large and 
voluptuous was enveloped in the folds 
of a snow-white morning gown which 
gathering lightly around her queenly 
figure displayed the symmetry of her 
rounded arms the fulness of her bust 
and the swelling outlines of her person 
in the richest varieties of light and 
shade a single red gleam of sun 
light escaping through tho folds of 
the window-curtain streamed over the 
whiteness of her snowy neck 



the forger 



her head resting on the sofa cush 
ion with the dark hair falling care 
lessly around her eyes were half- 
closed in dreamy reverie and the 
brightness of her glance subdued to a 
hazy dimness which attested the ab 
sence of her thoughts from all out 
ward things stole mildly from the 
shadow of the ong and trembling 
lashes 

here entire attitude was that of a 
person absorbed in some delightful 
reverie her hands were gently clasp 
ed in front of her form her limbs as 
you might see by the folds of her 
dress were carelessly crossed one 
over the other while one small and 
delicate foot with the slender ancle 
encased in the snow-white stocking 
was visible as she lay with her volup 
tuous person thrown lightly along the 
sofa 

she was indeed a beautiful and vo- 
mptuous woman the deep vermillion 
of her lips the burning flush crimsoning 
each cheek the blackness of her eye 
lashes and pencilled brows the long 
dark hair which when all unbound 
fell in thick and glossy tresses below 
her waist the fullness of her bosom 
the swelling roundness of her limbs 
the smallness of her feet and the de 
licacy of her hands with long and ta 
pering fingers all attested her love 
liness and beauty while the swim 
ming glance of her large eyes indi 
cates the innate voluptuousness of her 
nature 

her eyes were of that deep and 
well-like brightness which seems to 
throw open to the vision of the gazer 
not only their mellowed glance and 
dazzling radiance but the entire pros- 
peci of th hidden soul you gazed 



not upon but into those eyes aultj 
felt that you were in the presence of a 
mighty intellect and a sensual orgav 
nization 

as she lay reclining on the sofa a 
a low murmur of delight escaped from 
her lips and a flush like the sunny- 
side of a ripening peach blight- 
ened over her face and neck 
her eyelids slowly unclosing revealed 
her large dark eyes animate with an 
expression of sudden delight and 
beaming with a swimming brightness 
that finds no parallel save in the 
glance of a lovely and voluptuous 
woman 

dora rose slowly to her feet and 
stood erect upon the floor 

 that were a boon worth the peril 
of a soul to win she whispered in a 
low and softened tone as her hands 
absently toyed with the rose which 
rested upon her bosom a coronet 
yes yes a coronet this is a fair 
brow they tell me how well the glit 
tering circlet of diamonds would be 
come its beauty a coronet but one 
short year ago a poor girl clad in the 
threadbare costume which seems to 
belong by right to poverty-stricken 
gentility watched by the bedside of a 
dying mother in a meanly-furnished 
apartment faintly illumined by the 
beams of a flickering lamp now that 
poor girl is the wife of one of the 
merchant-princes of the city rolls in 
wealth almost without limit and of 
course moves among the first ciicles 
of the aristocracy of this good city 
such aristocracy ha ha like a spe 
cimen of paste-board statuary giving 
a grotesque outline of the reality 
which it is intended to represent 
another year ha ha my braia

grows wild another year and this 
same poor girl may no no will 
stand among the glittering circles of a 
royal court with the blaze of rank 
and beauty flashing all around her 
with the smile of a queen beaming 
upon her face while a coronet that 
tells the ancestral glories of a thou 
sand years rests brightly upon her 
brow 

 dora livingstone wife of living 
stone the merchant -prince that 
sounds well though prince that word 
merchant as you may it still re 
tains ha ha a wonderful taint of 
the shop but there is a title written 
on the very clouds which darken over 
my future which would sound much 
better and that title but hold my 
brain grows dizzy i seem to glide on 
air that title is 

 dora lyndeswold countess of 
lyndeswold said a deep voice at the 
shoulder of the beautiful woman 

she turned hastily round gazing 
upon the intruder with a glance of 
mingled surprise and anger 

fitz-cowles in all the elegance of 
his fashionable attire stood before her 
with his conical hat in one hand his 
gold -headed cane in the other while 
a smile of peculiar meaning lighted 
up his dusky countenance 

 ha ha dora you are surprised 
to see me the truth is old artichoke 
your gardener attracted my eye as i 
passed thr- ltrh the hall he wanted 
me to egt ne some of his favorite 
plants rile his attention was turn 
ed ano f way i stole up the back 
stairca- reached the conservatory 
and hf am yes yes dora not- 
jing your incredulous snv le 



it is in your power to do countess of 
lyndeswold 

 algernon it can never be ex 
claimed dora fixing the gaze of her 
brilliant eyes upon his countenance 
with a glance of strange meaning 

 but it can be dora and it must 
be answered fitz-cowles in a 
careless tone as he gently balanced 
his gold-headed cane on the palm of 
his right hand with a see-saw motion 

dora silently laid her hand on his 
shoulder and gazed into his eyes with 
a glance of deep interest 

 by what means you would ask t 
by flight yes by flight next tues- 
day the great western sails from 
new york let us arrange all our 
matters take passage on board the 
steamer and in fifteen days we will be 
in london it is but a day s ride from 
london to lyndeswold 

lyndeswold echoed dora 
and the name seemed to act like a spell 
upon her ah ha england boasts 
an aristocracy founded on high deeds 
whose records we trace in the history 
of a thousand years the aristocracy 
of this land and ha ha this cify ia 
founded on what can you tell 
algernon t 

 i ve been trying to find out for the 
last three months i flatter myself 
that i know something about the pe 
culiar merits and glories of quaker 
city aristocracy 
 an aristocracy founded on the 
high deeds of dentists tape-sellers 
quacks pettifoggers and bank direc 
tors all jumbled together in a r idicu- 
lous mass of absurdities your den 
tist whose proper court of arms 
should be a tooth and p ncers on a

field gules sends to the herald s col 
lege in london and asks the herald s 
to trace back his pedigree to the con 
quest and so with all tin classes of 
the philadelphia ton now could we 
establish a herald s college in the 
state house i would make the pro 
fession of every man the rule by 
which to fashion his crest or coat of 
arms to the quack a pill-box 
to the petifogger three links of a con 
victs chain with the penitentiary in 
the distance to the bank director a 
widow s coffin with a weeping or 
phan on either side by way of heral 
dic supporters pah there is no sin 
gle word of contempt in the whole 
language too bitter to express my 
opinion of this magnificent pretension 
the aristocracy of the quaker 
city 

 you are quite animated dora 
i never trouble myself about such 
mall matters 

 do you know what was the pro 
fession of my grandfather exclaim 
ed dora as with a smile of bitter sar 
casm playing on her proud lip she 
again confronted fitz-cowles why 
na ha ha he was guess what 

 a merchant perhaps or a mem 
ber of one of the oldest families of 
pennsylvania to use the slang of the 
day or or 

e a shoemaker shrieked dora 
with a burst of laughter as she strode 
hurriedly up and down the room 
 yes yes a shoemaker 

 a cobbler muttered fitz-cowles 
starting with a look of silent disgust 

 yes yes a toil-begrim d cobbler 
who sate working all day long on an 
old bench mending other peoples old 
shoos and i r shamed of this ha 



ha not in the least the cobbler s 
grand-daughter moves in the first cir 
cles of the aristocracy of philadel- 
phia and what is something to her 
credit she is not ashamed of her an 
cestry she does not conceal it with 
some sounding pretension to high birth 
but at once and without reserve hor 
rifies the tape-and bobbin nobility of 
the quaker city with the plain decla 
ration that dora livingstone wife of 
the merchant prince is a cobbler s 
grand-daughter 

 deuce take me if i can under 
stand you dora you are not ashamed 
of having a shoemaker for your grand 
father and yet you reverence the spi 
rit of ancestral pride 

 you have given my jipinions with 
remarkable precision tell you al 
gernon that i respect the mechanic 
at his bench though his hands be 
rough his face begrimed with toil 
his manners uncouth and destitute of 
polish but for the petty aristocrat 
the duke thimble-and-thread the 
count soap-and-candle the baron 
peddle-and -cheat for all these i do 
entertain the most sovereign contempt 
give me the honest mechanic at the 
bench if we must have a nobility for 
your true republican nobleman not 
the dishonest bank-director at the i 
desk but if you pass the mechanic 
aside whose honest vote sustains 
your republic if you pass him aside 
when you form your aristocracy then 
i say give us the titles and the trap 
pings of an english nobility let 
at once have a throne and a count 
a king and courtiers j 

 ha ha ha dora you grow 
philosophical decidedly so but you 
have quite forgotten my proposition 



dora livingstone at home 



 



flight dora sudden and successful 
flight 

 and do you think fitz-cowles 
that i would fly with you as an it is 
a sweet word and a true one as an 
adultress as an adultress forsak 
ing her husband no no by my 
life no 

 once in england we could be 
united in marriage without the slight 
est difficulty you would become the 
countess of lyndeswold on the death 
of my father when i would succeed 
to the earldom during his life our 
title would merely be my lord and 
lady dalveny of lyndeswold 

 countess of lyndeswold and my 
husband living in america ha ha 
ha this is like some probable his 
tory in the arabian nights 

 and how do you propose to over 
come the the difficulty 

 which is but another name for 
a husband after all muttered 
dorainatoneinaudible to fitz-cowles 

you know dora that we must 
arrange our plan of action without de 
lay a solitary word of suspicion 
whispered in your husband s ears by 
some officious friend and our schemes 
are blown to the gentleman in 
black 

dora approached fitz-cowles and 
laid her hand on his shoulder while 
br dark eyes flashing with a deep 
and meaning glance were fixed upon 
his countenance 

 suppose livingstone should die 
she said in a low whisper while her 
eyes became intensely brilliant and 
her face grew suddenly pale 

 why replied fitz-cowles with 
a slight start why you would then 
ye he widow livingstone with a for- 



i tune of some two hundred thousand in 
your possession but you know dora 
livingstone bids fair to live at least 
half a century from the present mo 
ment 

livingstone may die and that 
suddenly said dora in that same 
low tone while the hand resting on 
fitz-cowles shoulder trembled like a 
leaf 

 egad dora you re white as 
snow in the face one would think 
you meant something by the 
glance of your eyes do speak out 
and let us hear the news 

 listen algernon and i will tell 
you a secret strong and vigorous 
man as he looks livingstone has been 
for years the victim of a secret and 
insidious disease it is that disease 
which slowly and quietly almost with 
out pain ossifies the main arteries of 
the heart the victim may live for 
years with the flush of health on his 
cheek and brow while this insidious 
disease is closing up the avenues of 
his life he may live for years with 
all the outward signs of health and 
vigor when a sudden excitement of 
mind would lay him down a lifeless 
corse aye in an instant without a 
single pain to warn him of his danger 
he would fall a lifeless corse 

 yes yes i remember mctorni- 
quet the queer doctor who talks 
of henry clay the statesman and 
henry clay his blood horse all in 
the same breath took the trouble 
one day last week to explain this 
disease to me however he did not 
tell me that livingstone was its vic 
tim 

 this doctor who is our family 
physician called here but an hour 



 



the forger 






ago and asked me when i expected 
 mr livingstone back from new york 
i answered of course next week he 
then told me that the main arteries of 
my husband s heart were now almost 
entirely ossified that i must take 
every care in the world of him for 
any s idden excitement would kill 
him ir in instant 

 wha a pity poor fellow to 
think of a man going about with such 
a bad heart in his bosom 

 you understand me then liv 
ingstone may live for twenty nay for 
thirty years longer and he may die 
in a year a month a day or it 
may be in an hour 

i appreciate his position dora 
to say the least its a very ticklish 
one jove the idea of a man hav 
ing red cheeks bright eyes and a 
firm step while his heart is turning to 
bone the idea of such a state of af 
fairs i say 

dora drew nearer to algernon s 



 in the course of a series of lectures de 
livered last winter by the gifted dr mitchell 
celebrated no less for his medical attainments 
than his poetical genius the learned gentle 
man described the disease of the heart in de 
tail from his lecture i derived a knowledge 
of the various phenomena of the disease 
which i have used in this portion of my nar 
rative the learned doctor described in 
eloquent terms the insidious manner in which 
this disease through a long course of years 
gradually ossified the avenues to the heart of 
its victim until at last his life would hang 
suspended by a hair the victim might live 
for years if i do not mis-quote the doctor 
with the main arteries of the heart most entire 
ly ossified but a sudden and violent excitement 
would result in instantaneous death since 
he lectures of the doctor i have seen the 
truth of his remarks confirmed in the death

apparent health at the very moment when he 
fell a lifeless corse 



side and suddenly grasped him by 
the wrist there was a wild light 
j gleaming from her dark eyes as she 
gazed fixedly in his face and a slight 
wrinkle indented the surface of her fair 
forehead between the eyebrows her 
voi e was utterly changed in its tones 
when she whispered these words to the 
listener s ear 

 algernon give me your advice on 
a point of the deepest interest when 
my husband returns from new york 
iwill seize the earliest opportunity to 
press upon his attention the import 
ance of having his will prepared with 
out delay poor man his life hangs 
by a slender thread the most trifling 
chance may sever that thread and 
precipitate him into eternity it is 
important therefore that he should 
hold himself prepared for death jus 
tice to his wife demands that his will 
making a final disposition of his for 
tune should be executed with alt pos 
sible haste 

by jove dora you look quite 
wild to what tends all this hush 
did you not hear a footstep in the 
conservatory 

 suppose algernon that my hus 
band should make his will suppose 
he leaves his fortune to his wife 
these suppositions made i wish you 
to imagine a scene livingstone and 
myself are seated in the parlor on a 
winter s evening beside the cheerful 
fire his face is lighted up with a 
pleasant smile as displaying the un 
folded will in his hands he gazes 
upon the beaming countenance of his 
wife and that wife mark you 
algernon at the very moment when 
the husband reaches forth his arms to 
clasp her to his bosom falls on her

knees at his feet and in broken words 
shrieks forth the story of her guilt and 
his dishonor yes yes to his ear 
to the ear of the man who loves his 
wife as man never loved wife before 
that young and innocent wife ells the 
dark story of her shame even 
while his face beams with affection 
she tells him that he is dishonored 
aye dishonored that she has been 
false to his bed recreant to her plight 
ed faith that she is polluted in per 
son corrupt in soul that this young 
wife whom he loved so well is ha 
ha an adultress this she tells 
him with tears of repentance with 
prayers for mercy with groans of 
anguish and he how think ye 
livingstone would hear this confession 
from the wife whose very image he 
now worships ha algernon 
think ye not it would kill him even 
before his frantic wife had done with 
her tale of guilt even as he sate 
without a moments delay he would 
fall from his chair a stiffened corse 
would he not algernon 

a blasphemous oath escaped from 
fitz-cowles lips and in a sudden 
start which shook his frame he suf 
fered his hat and cane to fall on the 
floor 

by g d dora i don t think 
i you re a human being 

he said this in a low-toned voice 
and turned away from the merchant s 
wife as she stood in the centre of the 
room her statue dilating to its full 
heighth while with a panting bosom 
and a flashing eye she awaited his 
answer to her momentous question 

 and this she cried gazing upon 
fitz-cowles who stood near the win 
dow with his face averted from hsr 
 



glance and this after i have sacri 
ficed all i possess on earth all i hope 
in heaven and sacrificed for you 

 hun did nt you hear a foot 
step in the conservatory really 
dora you are very imprudent ex 
claimed fitz-cowles in a sullen tone 
as he gazed vacantly through the win 
dow-curtains 

 would to god there had been a 
footstep in the conservatory when i 
first resigned myself to shame said 
dora in a tone of keen and biting 
sarcasm 

 when a lady agrees makes up 
her mind to part with her virtue and 
a gentleman makes up his mind to 
accept the gift all is fair and satisfac 
tory and nobody but an injured hus 
band has a right to complain but 
murder dora murder 

 murder madman that you are 
who spoke of murder fitz-cowles 
i beseech you do not force me to 
change my opinion with regard to 
you i thought you were a man one 
of that class in fact who look rather 
to the end that is to be accomplished 
than to the delicacy of the means 

 but dora this experiment of 
yours has ten chances of failure to 
one of success livingstone might 
recover from the shock occasioned by 
your confession 

then it is the chance of failure 
not the experiment itself which turns 
your face to the hue of ashes 

 d n the thing dora livingstone 
never wronged me and i can t see 
that he has done you any injury suffi 
cient to warrant such a return 

 i perceive algernon said dora 
crossing her arms with a calm ge- 
ture you do not undei stand me 



 



the forger 



livingstone never did me a wrong 
on the contrary he has bestowec 
wealth upon me almost without bound 
and lavished affection upon me until 
it amounts to idolatry you never 
gave me wealth you never gave me 
love then what is the tie that binds 
me to you you have it in your 
power to grace the the ha ha 
the cobbler s grand-daughter with a 
title livingstone is the bar sinister 
ha ha between me and hereditary 
rank who spoke of murder not 
i by my life livingstone may die 
he may die that was all i said 
 he may die that is true said 
fitz-cowles turning away from the 
window by-the-bye dora you are 
remarkably ambitious for a sensible 
woman your very soul seems ab 
sorbed in this ambition to rise j 

 there is a leaf of my heart fitz- 
cowles which you never yet have 
read i loved once loved with all 
the intensity of my nature and sacri 
ficed my plighted love for wealth and 
livingstone idid you never read in 
books that the first love of a strong 
minded woman when divested from its 
proper source turns to the gall and 
bitterness of worldly ambitiogj i feel 
in my inmost soul that i was destined 
from my birth to rank and station to 
the sway of hearts and the rule of 
power in my early childhood when 
forced by penury my mother a wi 
dowed and a friendless woman sought 
a home in the outskirts of the city 
the prophecy was whispered in my 
ears that one day i should wear a co 
ronet and walk a titled lady among 
the grandees of a royal court 
 and some old crone i suppose 



with a cup sprinkled with tea-grounaa 
in her hand was the oracle 

 it matters not for the prophecy 
come it from whom it might found its 
echo in my own heart does it not 
often chance that a casual word ut 
tered by an ignorant mechanic strikes 
a mighty chord in some statesman s 
heart and originates a new and mag 
nificent scheme of state policy so n 
chance word from vulgar lips may 
arouse a prophecy which has beer 
hidden in our souls since the hour of 
our birth why did the creole josephine 
credit the withered hag who foretold 
that her brow would one day be en 
circled with the crown of france 
because the old crone was gifted by 
heaven with especial power no 
no no she might have foretold a 
thousand incidents and not one would 
have impressed the heart of josephine 
with even a passing sensation 

 on the heart of this same creole 
josephine from the hour of her birth 
had been written down by god s own 
hand the high destiny for which she 
had been born and the chance words 
of the old crone aroused the pro- 
phecy into life 

 hush dora there is a footstep 
on the stairs exclaimed fitz 
cowles with a sudden start 

 my god it is livingstone s foot 
step and as she spoke dora s face 
grew suddenly pale ha the note 
which i left last night on the centre 
table was gone when i looked for it 
this morning could he have returned 
n the night 

the door leading into the main buiid- 
ng of the mansion was suddenly 
opened and a red-faced servah -n 



dora livingstone at home 



 



grey livery turned up with velvet 
entered the boudoir 

 mister livingstone ma am 

and in an instant livingstone ap 
peared in the doorway and entered 
the room 

 ah ha my dear i ve stole a 
march on you have i back from 
new york sooner than i expected 
you see ah ha colonel is that 
you how do you do 

 my god livingstone how pale 
you are was the involuntary excla 
mation of the wife as her eyes were 
riveted to his countenance have 
you been ill 

 egad you look as if you been 
sick a-month exclaimed fitz-cowles 
 why livingstone positively you re 
turning grey 

calm and smiling livingstone ad 
vanced and gathered his right arm 
round the waist of his beautiful wife 
his face was very pale and his blue 
eyes had an unnatural brilliancy in 
their glance which in the mind of an 
acute observer might have aroused a 
suspicion as to the sanity of the mer 
chant 

 one kiss my love exclaimed 
livingstone as he pressed his lips to 
the full and pouting lips of his wife 
while his face brightened with a look 
of pleasure you must excuse 
these little matrimonial attentions fitz- 
cowles we married men are very 
apt to be fond of our wives espe 
cially after a long absence and how s 
your poor sick friend my dear 

 you have my note then ex 
claimed dora as a slight tremor was 
visible on her lip 

 to be sure my dear to be sure 
 returned from new york in the night 



found your note on the contro-lable 
and having read its contents i retired 
from the house without alarming the 
servants i spent the night at the 
counting-house examining my books 
and papers how did you say your 
poor sick friend was dora 

 alas she is dead and dora 
turned away as if to conceal her agi 
tation 

well well it can t be helped 
debt we ve all got to pay as the 
old women at a funeral have it by- 
the-bye fitz-cowles i ve got some 
traces of the forger at last 

the merchant laid his hand play 
fully on fitz-cowles shoulder and 
gazed smilingly in his eyes while his 
unoccupied hand toyed with his watch- 
seals in a careless manner 

 the deuce you have answered 
fitz-cowles with a stare of surprise- 
 by jove he muttered to himself 
 there is a strange look about li 
vingstone s eyes that does nt exactly 
please me 

 i tell you how it was my boy 
continued livingstone still toying 
with his watch-seals while i was 
in new york the head clerk of the 
charleston house arrived in town he 
recognized the forger one day in 
broadway strutting it among the 
finest bucks of the city 

 and you arrested him 

 not exactly we had evidence 
enough for suspicion but conviction 
you know is a different thing you ll 
laugh when i tell you how i managed 
it with the fellow he was one ot my 
most intimate friends in new york 
and was wont to frequent my rooms 
very much during the day manifest 
ing his familiarity by calling me 



 



the forger 



jolh old fellow old lin and all 
that kind of thing you understand 
before the head clerk arrived from the 
south i did not ever dream of sus 
pecting this perfumed gentleman of 
the forgery why colonel do you 
know that i d just as soon suspected 
you as him 

 curse me livingstone these kind 
of comparisons are deuced unplea 
sant observed fitz-cowles grow- 
ing very uneasy under the merchant s 
gaze 

 what do you think we did when 
we found that we had nt evidence 
sufficient for conviction why ha 
ha it s two good we dressed up 
a decayed police officer like a sou 
thern planter and introduced him to 
the forger as a gentleman of immense 
fortune from the south the forger 
promenades new york with the dis 
guised police officer at his elbow 
showing the pseudo-planter all the 
lions of the town and making him 
self agreeable in a general way now 
the joke of the thing 

yes echoed fitz-cowles 
 the joke of the thing 

 is simply this the southern 
planter has a warrant in his pocket 
for the arrest of the forger the mo 
ment he shall attempt to leave the city 
ha ha ha capital 

 capital capital ha ha ha 
roared fitz-cowles 

 is nt it too good 

 ha ha ha it is too good a 
warrant in his pocket for the arrest 
of the forger all the while did ye 
say capital ha ha ha capital 

why fitz-cowles your ladye- 
love has been making free with a lock 
m our hair exclaimed livingstone 



playfully look here dora what 
space there is near fitz-cowles righ 
temple a large lock severed close to 
the skin why dora i declare you 
too have been making somebody a 
present of a lock of your hair a 
large tress severed from the hair near 
your right temple too singular co 
incidence oh fitz-cowles 

with the same involuntary gesture 
fitz-cowles and dora both raised 
their hands to their right temples and 
both discovered that a large tress was 
missing from among the clustering 
locks of their raven-black hair 

 curse that barber i shall have to 
flog him muttered fitz-cowles- 
 how deuced careless in him 

 positively albert i can t tell how 
this occurred said dora approach 
ing her husband i must have cut 
it off in my sleep how extremely 
odd or somebody may have cut 
it off to save you the trouble while 
you were asleep said livingstone 
with a kindly smile as turning from 
his wife he approached one of the 
windows and looked out upon the sky 

meanwhile dora stood silent and 
thoughtful her bosom heaving upward 
with sudden pulsations clashed for a 
moment convulsively together trem 
bled with the agitation that quivered 
through her whole frame 

 now she murmured as a slight 
pallor overspread her beautiful coun 
tenance now is the moment of 
my fate the disease gathering round 
his heart manifests its progress al 
ready in his countenance i will con 
fess all ha ha i will throw myself at 
his feet and beseech his pardon 

 fitz-cowles turned pale as ashes 
he did not hear the whispered word 



dora livingstone at home 



 



v 



of dora but he read her fixed and des 
perate purpose in the lines of her coun- 
lenance now moulded into an express 
ion as unrelenting as death while 
his brain whirled round in wild con 
fusion he resolved to delay or at least 
 thwart the accomplishment of her 
purpose 

 aid me now great father before 
whomt shall so soon appear were 
the murmured words that broke from 
the white lips of livingstone as with 
his face turned from his wife and her 
paramour he made a pretence of 
gazing upon the clear and blue winter s 
sky i feel that fit of madness com 
ing over me again oh for a little 
strength to go through the mockery 
to pretend affection to the wife friend 
ship to the paramour there is frenzy 
in my veins i know it i feel it but 
i will i will command my soul 

and yet as the words escaped from 
his lips he felt that same feeling of 
mocking frenzy which had given its 
impulse to his actions in monk-hall 
the night before rushing like a torrent 
through his veins conscious that he 
was acting like a madman he drew a 
pistol from his bosom and making one 
stride across the floor held it to the 
heart of fitz-cowles 

 a handsome pistol colonel silver 
mounted with a hair trigger one 
touch of my finger and you re a dead 
man ha ha how you step back 
ward how you recede to the wall 
zounds man but i believe you re 
afraid 

for heaven s sake livingstone 
put the thing away cried fitz- 
cowles as with the pistol at his heart 
step by step he retreated to the wall 
 you might yoji know pull the trig- 



 ger by chance it s loaded you say 
and 

the bail might lodge in your 
heart ha ha ha so it might 
suppose we try 

as he spoke he pulled the trigger 
dora uttered an involuntary shriek as 
the clinking of the pistol broke on the 
air and then covered her face with 
her hands when she again looked 
around the room she beheld fitz- 
cowles standing in one corner pale 
as ashes while livingstone with a 
bitter smile wreathing his white lips 
still held the pistol presented at his 
breast 

 confound those caps not worth 
the having exclaimed livingstone 
with a pleasant smile - why colo 
nel ha ha ha you look as frighten 
ed as if ha ha ha i had intended to 
shoot you 

 the pistol was loaded hesi 
tated fitz-cowles as he averted his 
eyes from livingstone s flashing 
glance 

 loaded nonsense man i was 
merely trying some new percussion 
caps 

 the disease has affected his rea 
son muttered dora as she ad 
vanced to her husband s side now 
for the confession and the result 

you dropped your handkerchief 
mrs livingstone exclaimed fitz- 
cowles as starting hastily forward 
he presented the snow-white l mou- 
choirj with a low bow not on the 
peril of your soul he hissed the 
whisper between his set teeth as hia 
dark eyes were fixed upon her face 
with a malignant yet frightened glance 

she returned his glance with a look 
of scorn 



 



the forger 



she advanced to her husband s side 
she seized his arm with a convulsive 
grasp while her dark eyes flashed with 
an expression of the deepest emotion 

 livingstone she shrieked 
with all the pathos of voice and ges 
ture at her control i have much 
to tell you 

in another instant she lay panting 
upon his breast with her arms flung 
round his neck while the convulsive 
sobs which heaved her bosom broke 
wildly on her husband s ear 

fitz-cowles saw that his fate hung 
in a balance which the weight of a 
feather might turn 

 ha cried livingstone with the 
same strange glance which marked his 
wandering intellect flashing from his 
clear blue eye ha what means 
this agitation this sudden emotion 

these sobs and tears 

why the fact is livingstone 
your wife is anxious that is to say 

deuce take the thing dr mctor- 
niquet was here this morning and 
and dropped some strange hints 
about a disease to which you are sub 
ject and and your wife is alarm 
ed for your health 

ltc fools they think to deceive 
me thought livingstone as his wife 
lay sobbing in his arms they do 
not dream that i overheard their in 
genious plans as i stood in the con 
servatory not five minutes past ha 
ha i will be even with them oh 
with regard to the disease of the 
heart he continued aloud 
 which has threatened me for so 
many years i forgot to mention a 
slight circumstance mctorniquet 
rhis worning assured me that he 
bad long mistaken my symptoms 



i am no more in danger from any 
malady of this kind than you are my 
dear there dora don t weep i 
can well appreciate this affectionate 
regard for my health but you mus n t 
weep 

as dora lay with her head buried 
in his bosom a quick and sudden 
tremor shook her frame from head to 
foot she was deceived for once in 
her life and after having betrayed her 
husband in the very hour of his mad 
ness became his willing dupe with 
one start she raised her head and her 
face pale and ghastly from the effect 
of the sudden revulsion of feeling was 
disclosed in the morning sunlight 

oh livingstone she said in a 
voice tremulous with emotion i 
am so glad to discover that all my ap 
prehensions are groundless 

sh walked to the window as if to 
hide the agitation the joyful agitation 
which livingstone s unexpected dis 
closure had aroused in her soul as 
she passed fitz-cowles she darted a 
look in his face full of dark and fear 
ful meaning for a moment her coun 
tenance was convulsed by an express- 
ion hideous as it was resolute and 
then like a sunbeam gleaming from a 
cloud all was calm and smiling again 

by-the-bye dora i had nearly 
forgotten an important circumstance 
connected with our celebration of the 
christmas holidays you know my 
country seat of hawkwood in jersey 
some miles from cam den 
it is the old family mansion of the 
livingstone s was built in fact long 
before the revolution full of secret 
passages solemn old rooms with wide 
fireplaces lofty halls and wainscottmg 
without limit you know 



dora livingstone at home 



- 



 i have ofton heard of this strange 
old family seat replied dora with 
out turning from the window and 
have as often felt a desire to see the 
place 

you shall see it my dear within 
two days i have this morning des 
patched servants to the place in order 
to arrange the old hall for the celebra 
tion of christmas in the old english 
style to morrow morning we will 
start for hawkwood and spend the 
holiday s there fitz-cowles i hope 
you will favor us with your company 
you nod assent well that is settled 
and now i must away to the ware 
house you will excuse me fitz- 
cowles i ll be home to dinner my 
dear 

livingstone left the boudoir as he 
spoke 

dora turned from the window and 
faced fitz-cowles their eyes met 
in one deep and meaning glance 

well said fitz-cowles draw 
ing a long breath we re out of 
that d d scrape any how 

dora smiled but did not speak 
her attention was attracted by a loose 
slip of letter paper which lay on the 
carpet near her feet with a manner 
of easy nonchalance she picked this 
paper from the floor and examined it 
with a careless glance 

in a moment quick as a lightning 
flash her dark eyes shone with sudden 
fire her stature dilated to its full height 
and her bosom rose and fell beneath 
the folds of her morning gown with 
an impulse of the deepest agitation 
she stood in the centre of the room in 
ail her beauty and loveliness regard 
ing the paper which she held in her 
trembling hand with one intense and 



flashing glance while her face waa 
crimsoned over by a sudden flush of 
excitement there was an expression 
of scorn mingled with triumph on her 
curving lip and her high forehead 
was impressed with a slight yet mean 
ing frown 

 why dora you are agitated 
exclaimed fitz-cowles advancing 
 what can there be in that slip of 
paper to move you thus 

her eyes gleamed like flame-coals 
as the answer broke from her lips in 
a slow and deliberate whisper ren 
dered most wild and thrilling br th 
sudden huskiness of her voice 

 leave that to me and to ltlt 
future 



chapter fifth 

the gold watch 

 luke you know how liable wt 
are to accident and sudden death if 
i should die suddenly i wish you to 
open this packet and execute the com 
mission which it names consider 
this request luke as the last request 
of a dying man will you promise 
me 

i will and do promise you 
luke replied grasping the hand of 
livingstone as soon as you are 
dead i will open this packet and at 
every peril at all hazards execute the 
commission which it names egad 
he muttered to himself he seems 
to have recovered from his mad fit 
a precious tramp i ve had up and 
down this beautiful city ever since day 
break in order to cool him off 



 



the forger 



 now luke i must go home to 
my family said livingstone with a 
faint smile as they emerged from the 
exchange here we part luke at 
least for a little while it is now nine 
o clock at noon i will meet you at 
my house on especial business good 
morning 

they parted livingstone pursued 
his way up walnut street while luke 
harvey remained standing at the cor 
ner of walnut and third 

 i don t suppose anything peculiar 
will take place between this and sun 
down do i very likely i don t 
possibly i do well well let mat 
ters take their course when a wo 
man adorns her husband s forehead 
with horns she ought to remember 
that these ornamental branches may 
be turned into dangerous weapons 
stags gore people sometimes w-h-ew 
there s that tooth again i must to 
some tooth-butcher right off 

with great deliberation luke took 
his black silk cravat from around his 
neck and investing his mouth and 
jaws with its folds fastened it over the 
top of his head with an ornamental 
knot he presented rather a singular 
picture his long and slim figure 
was enveloped in a tight overcoat 
his hat was drawn down over his 
brows while his face was nearly 
concealed by the folds of the black 
cravat which left a glimpse of his 
eyes the top of his nose and a small 
portion of each cheek exposed to view 

 i ll swear that tooth of mine must 
have joined a fire company by the 
way it goes on w-h-ew 

passing the various good citizens 
who were pursuing their way alcng 
walnut street luke after a-half-an- 



hour s brisk walking with nis hand 
pressed against his jaw all the while 
arrived before a splendid mansion 
with a great big silver plate affixed to 
the door pilpette surgeon 
dentist was blazoned on the plate 
in immense letters luke rung the 
bell and was swearing quietly at his 
tooth when a liveried servant appear 
ed and showed him into a large room r 
furnished in a style of lavish and auc 
tion-store splendor where mr auguste 
pilpette stood surrounded by the ma 
terials of his elegant profession 

mr auguste pilpette was a stout 
little man with a high forehead and a 
nose which would have been roman 
if it hadn t been shaped like a pear 
mr pilpette prided himself on his 
resemblance to louis phillipe and 
his acquaintance with the literature of 
the day mr pilpette had been a 
bricklayer the year before and hi 
name had been jonas pulp which by 
the same lively exertion of imagina 
tion that transformed the layer of 
bricks into the puller of teeth had 
been changed into auguste pilpette 

 pilpette this tooth s agoin on as 
tho it would break my jaw and blow 
my brains out pull it 

 we will soon arrange this little 
matter said auguste pilpette seat 
ing mr harvey in a chair which 
looked as though it had been made for 
an alderman in the days when alder 
men averaged three hundred pounds 
a-piece we ll soon arrange this 
little matter a bad tooth shocks 
ing what s your opinion of bui 
wer 

 bui wer be d d pulp pull mgtj 
tooth 

 pulp did not please mr augusta 



the gold watch 



 



pilpette on the contrary mr pil- 
pette was chafed 

 pulp indeed he muttered i ll 
give him a wrench for that 

and accordingly throwing luke s 
head so far back that his upturned 
eyes commanded a view of the vane 
surmounting a distant steeple which 
was visible through the lofty window 
mr pilpette proceeded to give mr 
harvey a wrench 

it was decidedly a wrench luke 
sprang from the chair with a tremend 
ous bound and an oath 

 d n n he muttered or hissed 
and the man who objects to the oath 
never had the toothache d n n 
why pulp you were born two cen 
turies too late the inquisition ought 
to have had you 

don t you think dickens excels 
 in the quiet touches said mr pil 
pette with great suavity as luke 
performed an irregular polka over the 
room it seems to me there s a 
feeling and a finish in dickens 

 pulp you are an ass replied 
luke rather harshly as well-nigh 
convulsed with the pain of his un 
worthy member the half-drawn tooth 
he dashed into mr pilpette s window 
curtains and looked out upon the 
street it s my opinion pulp that 
in you the inquisition would have ex 
perienced a great acquisition hollo 
who s that 

pulp pilpette inquisition toothache 
and all were forgotten as luke gazed 
out in the street with a stare of vacant 
wonder lengthening his visage 

 i ll soothe him by a criticism 
thought pilpette do you think mr 
harvey that the beauties of shelly 
are appreciated by the mass 



what shouted luke gazing 
into the street in the street at broad 
daylight i d swear it s him ha 
ellis mortimer he turns the cor 
ner now or never 

while mr pilpette stood stricken 
dumb with astonishment luke flung 
up the window-sash and sprang out 
upon the pavement before mr pilpette 
could say jonas pulp rising from 
the pavement for he had fallen in the 
spring luke rushed down walnut 
street at the top of his speed while 
his long black hair and the flaps of 
his overcoat streamed carelessly in 
the wind 

the spectacle of a hatless man 
traversing walnut street at the top of 
his speed in a cold winters day had 
rather a maniac wildness in it and ac 
cordingly two ladies with sharp faces 
and blue nose-tips stopped somewhat 
suddenly in their course and gazed 
after the retreating form of luke a 



very ragged newsboy with whom the 
sharp-nosed ladies has just been en 
deavoring to trade two pious tracts 
headed bad children in hell for 
one extrey ledgey containing ac 
counts of a steamboat accident on the 
mississippi also turned round and 
looked after luke with an emphatic 
adjuration to his whiskers 

 oh you bad youth said the 
sharpest of the sharp-faced tract dis 
tributors don t you know where 
little boys that say bad words will go 
to 

 can t say i do house o refuge 
m am 

 oh you ignorant and deplorably- 
neglected youth said the other lady 
whose nose was tipped with the faintest 
shade of blue give me that extra 



 



the forger 



ledger and i ll give you this tract 
which tells you all about the bad 
place 

 i d rather not a-cause veri the 
bad place comes it comes and vots 
the use of a feller riling his system 
with it aforehand 

with these words the unrepentant 
youth strode away making the air 
vocal with extrey ledgey steam 
boat blowed up on massesappy ten 
hunder lives lost all for two cents 

meanwhile dashing along walnut 
street luke harvey pursued the dis 
tant form of a little hump-backed man 
who all unconscious of th danger at 
his back was quietly wending his on 
ward way it was not long however 
before he became cognizant of his 
pursuer while luke was half-a- 
equare distant he suddenly slipped 
into an alley and was lost to view 
luke turned into the alley emerged 
into an adjoining street but no signs 
could he discern of mr ellis mortimer 

 i would have sworn it was the 
jew he muttered gazing hurriedly 
up and down the street the very 
look and dress of the man 

 here s a remarkable state of af 
fairs one of the first merchants in 
town digging along walnut street on 
a cold winters day without his hat 
ha ha quite unique in the way of 
le grand spectacle as we say in do 
mestic french eh harvey 

 harvey echoed luke turning 
round to greet the new-comer why 
damme it s poodle poodle of the 
black mail go way fellow i 
hav n t got any bribe for you 

 he he he how jocular replied 
buzby poodle rubbing his hands 
pleasantly together i know what 



you re after the jew ha ha ha 
i ve been watching him yonder 
he goes harvey i say i might tell 
you something if i liked i might 
i ve been watching the jew 

 pooh the jew has no bribe to 
give you exclaimed luke with the 
most emphatic disgust hallo 
there he is far down seventh street 
i ll have him yet 

and down seventh street luke 
started with as much speed as though 
he had a match against time his hair 
and coat-flaps streaming in the wind 
while buzby poodle watched his pro 
gress with quiet wonder 

ha ha there he goes like 
mad he s a-diggin down seventh 
street he nears the jew two to 
one on harvey anybody take that 
bet ha the jew turns round- 
bra vo now the race becomes excit 
ing some little boys join the pursuit 
a coal heaver flings down his shovel 
and pelts after em the jew s ahead 
go it hump-back go it harvey 
hullo he s got him no he s 
clear he turns down an alley 
they re gone i d like to bet a con 
siderable amount on the jew yet 
hum-hum harvey wouldn t buy 
me bad that for harvey i can 
guess that he entertains some suspicions 
with regard to fitz-cowles else why 
does he pursue the hump-backed gen 
tleman whom i tracked from the 
rooms of the millionaire i think 
we must sell harvey to fitz-cowles 
damme i ll cut up that fellow harvey 
in to-morrow s black mail i ll be 
bitter d d bitter 

the state house struck eleven 
his face all crimson with excitement 



the gold watch 



 



his brow streaming with thick drops 
of perspiration his long hair flying 
wildly in the wind from under the 
shadow of a very bad hat which he 
had borrowed from a friend luke 
harvey came slowly round the corner 
of certain prominent streets in a re 
mote district of the city his entire 
appearance betraying great exhaustion 
of body mingled with considerable 
depression of spirits 

 nearly two hours passed in chas 
ing that cursed jew poh pretty 
figure i cut the jew ahead a long 
tail of boys sweeps and coal heavers 
behind me wild chorus of yells 
rending the air people flinging up 
their windows ha ha twig that 
man without a hat all humbug 
kullo here s the old woman s house 
damme i ll go in and see her 

luke stood in front of a three storied 
dwelling which remarkable for its 
old and desolate appearance stood 
among a cluster of pawnbroker shops 
like a decayed gentleman surrounded 
by pickpockets and thieves thick 
masses of rank green moss grew over 
the steep roof and the garret window 
was stuffed with an old straw hat and 
bundles of rags the shutters on the 
first story were entirely closed through 
the windows of the second floor faded 
green blinds of a damp and mouldy 
aspect were visible while the glasses 
of the remaining windows in the third 
story were concealed by rough boards 
nailed loosely to the window-frame on 
the outside the solitary front door 
was one of your old fashioned front 
doors with massive posts and heavy 
cornices the old brass knocker was 
covered with a thick crust of verdigris 
and all along the door ind frame 



some industrious hand had driven in 
numerable nails and spikes of every 
size and pattern as though a hard 
ware merchant had been seized with 
an original fancy and wished to turn 
the whole concern into a business card 

in fact it looked just like the house 
which all the restless spirits in the city 
gentlemen and lady ghosts who fre- 
-quent graveyards nightly and prevail 
very numerously in christmas-time 
about the halls of old mansions would 
choose for their scene of assemblage 
in case the spiritual fraternity deter 
mined upon a national convention of 
all the ghosts in the union a sort of 
death s head festival with the skele 
ton-god himself in the chair 

becky smolby lived in this ancient 
house becky smolby and an irish 
female servant were the only tenants 
of the old time mansion who becky 
smolby was or what were her sources 
of livelihood was a question often 
asked but by no means frequently 
answered becky was old penurious 
and avaricious every body knew 
that didn t she keep the female ser- 
vant for one entire week on stale gin 
gerbread and sassafras beer jbecky 
was queer and whimsical this point 
was never doubted did she not keep 
candles burning all the day long in 
the old mansion even when she was 
starving herself for the want of gene 
rous onion-soups and broiled steaks 
becky was rich aye aye old rooms 
umbered with antique but costly furni 
ture mysterious caskets standing upon 
picturesque sideboards of black ma 
hogany great monsters of chests 
stowed away beneath canopied bed 
steads ribbed with bras bands and 
corded with thick ropes all bore wit- 



 



the forger 



ness of becky s hidden plate and 
doubloons becky was capricious to 
a fault had she been a little younger 
and worn blue stockings and talked 
dictionary she would have been term 
ed a genius and her whims would 
have assumed the shape of amiable 
eccentricities peculiar to a gifted mind 
becky had four cats and a parrot by 
way of agreeable companions on whom 
she was wont to bestow her daily in 
vestments of good humor which as 
the reader may judge were sometimes 
remarkably limited in their nature 
while she kept her irish female servant 
as a sort of safety valve for all her 
vapors spites animosities and what 
was worse than all her reminiscences 
of her five husbands buddy crank 
yjdulpins smolby and tuppick 

how becky made all her money 
was a mystery the tariff free 
trade or even the grand question 
 what ever became of the funds of the 
united states bank were nothing to 
it some said she had saved it in the 
course of matrimonial experience by 
stinting her five husbands some

him steadily down some day or other

becky for a few hard dollars or per 
haps a gold eagle or two while the 
transfer was going on the gentleman 
placing his finger to his lips would 
whisper mysteriously the monosylla 
ble mum to which becky would re

as the mum-mum trade

 well well cried luke as he 
gazed upon the front of the old house 
 the old lady has always passed for 
my aunt the man in the moon knows 
whether fm related to her at all at 
all events i ll go in and see her 

he gave a slight tap with the 
knocker 

in a large room furnished in an 
old fashioned style sate the ancient 
lady bending over a small table on 
which was placed two lighted candles 
flinging their glaring light full in her 
withered face 

opposite the old lady sate a gen 
tleman of some forty-five resting in a 
capacious arm-chair his corpulent 
form clad in glossy broadcloth while 
his round face of oily sweetness was 
strikingly relieved by the snow-white 
cravat encircling his neck the sharp 
features of the old lady all their harsh 
ness of outline thrown out into the 
light by the tight-fitting black silk 
cap which covered her head were im 
pressed with peculiar and distinctive 
characteristics a long aquiline nose 
hooked like an eagle s beak thick 
grey eyebrows meeting together and 
shooting up ato the forehead at either 
extremity like two sides of a triangle 
small dark eyes quick piercing and 
brilliant in their glance a wide mouth 
with thin lips much sunken from the 
absence of teeth a pointed chin and 
high cheekbones a gave a stern and 
decided expression to the countenance 
of the aged dame which was in strong 
contrast with the oily sweetness of the 
round face whose large grey eyes 
were gazing in her own n 

tthe reverend dr pyne who sate 
opposite commonly called fat pyne 



from the initials of his name or his 
peculiar disposition to blaze up in hid 
sermons was a fine specimen of a 
well-preserved dealer in popular credu 
lity a red round face with thick 
lips watery grey eyes and lanky hair 
of a doubtful color mingling white 
and brown and hanging in uneven 
masses around the outline of his vis 
age formed the details of a counte 
nance very sanctimonious and some 
what sensual in its slightest expres- 
sionj

peggy grud who had suddenly ap 
peared in the doorway of the room 
was a tall stout irishwoman coarsely 
clad with large hands and a withered 
face looking as though it had been 
scorched in some fire and hardened to 
the dryness of an egyptian mummy 
surrounded by an immense cotton 
night-cap adorned with colossial ruf

the reverend gentleman turned 
aside and spiritualized a whistle 
in plainer english puckered up his

like a sigh was all that escaped his 
lips

gazed from face to face justice and 
in the quaker city a strange mon

the doors of the prison and bids the

the old lady led the way up two 
pair of dark stairs followed by luke 
in a few moments they stood in a 
large room on the third floor whose 
outlines luke might dimly discern by 
the glimmer of the candle which the 
old lady grasped in her hand k was 
wide and spacious the floor covered 
with carpet of an ancient though costly 
pattern while the ceiling was em 
blazoned with a picture in fresco 
whose gorgeous hues had been soften 
ed down by time massive velvet 
curtains hung along the three win

hermetically closed by the boards 
outside the sashes a bed with a lofty 
canopy was in one corner an an 
tique dressing bureau surmounted by 
a circular mirror stood in the space 
between two of the windows a wide 
hearth with ashes and loose pieces of 
half burned wood scattered over the 
bricks extended along one entire end 
of the chamber while the wall above 
the mantel was concealed by a large 
picture set in a gorgeous frame it 
was the picture of a fair and lovely 
girl remarkable for the brilliancy of 
her eyes and the midnight blackness 
of her hair 

it was a singular circumstance 
which did not escape the notice of 
luke that the carpet was covered 
with thick dust as though it had not 
been open for years while the velvet 
of the window curtains the gilt of the 
massive portrait frame and the hang 
ings of the bed were all obscured by 
the same thick grey dust and hung 
with heavy spider webs 

ghost room indeed muttered 
luke why look here aunt the car 
pet is covered with dust and the air is 
damp and unwholesome as a grave 
vault what s the meaning of all 
this any how 

 it has not been opened since she 
died until this day said the widow 
smolby as her features withered and 
wrinkled as they were glowed with 
an expression of strange feeling 
 she died in yonder bed i held her 
in my arms her child lay dead upon 
her bosom yon hearth d ye see it 
luke the fire went out when she 
hied it has never been hghted 
since 

 what mean you cried luke 



amazed at the agitation of the old wo 
man ha he shouted ere she 
could answer his question here is 
the watch on the dressing bureau it 
is fitz-cowles by my life the jew 
must have stolen it from him fitz- 
cowles once told me that his name 
was inscribed within the case hold 
the light while i open it aunt ha 
what is this a memorandum on a 
slip of paper in fitz-cowles hand 
inserted between the case and the 
body of the watch in charleston 
on such a date must be in phila

 why luke what in the world s 
the matter with you cried the wi 
dow smolby in utter wonder you 
go on like mad howsomever here s 
the jew s accomplice sleeping in the 
bed don t she sleep sound for such 
a guilty thief 

leading the way along the floor the 
old lady pushed aside the cobweb- 
hung curtains and gazed upon the 
sleeper s form 

 ha the dead have come to 
life she shrieked starting back 
ward it is not the stranger it is 
my daughter just as she looked nine 
teen years ago when she was pure 
and innocent look luke look i 
say that pale face that long dark 
hair that iily white hand i d swear 
k was my daughter come to life 

advancing to the bedside luke 
gazed upon the sleeper s form as it 



the gold watch 



 



jay dimly disclosed by the light of the 
flickering candle 

the face of a fair young girl re 
lieved by long tresses of jet-black 
hair broke like a dream upon his 
gaze true it was the young form 
thrown aiong the bed in an attitude 
of slumber was clad in a dress of 
tattered rags yet the outline of a 
figure ripening from the bud of maid 
enhood into the bloom of beauty and 
womanhood might be discerned be 
neath the disguise of mean apparel 
true it was the face pale as death 
bore the traces of a long life of sorrow 
yet were the features regular the dark 
eyebrows penciled and arching the 
brow was calm and white full of the 
silent grandeur of intellect while the 
rounded outline of the cheeks the 
fulness of the pouting lips and the 
dimple of the chin all bespoke the 
youth and loveliness of the sleeper 

 thus nineteen years ago she lay 
upon that bed my only daughter 
seventeen years ago upon that bed 
she breathed her last since that 
hour the light of day has not shown 
within the walls of this house since 
that hour i have not stepped beyond 
the threshold of my home and now 
now she has arisen from the dead 

 and this cried luke gazing in 
silent wonder upon the pale yet beau 
tiful face of the sleeper this is the 
accomplice of the jew 

luke s exclamation aroused the 
old woman from her waking dream 
her daughter for whom she had 
mourned so long was forgotten when 
she remembered the five thousand dol- 
irs stolen from her house that very 

orning by the jew whose accom- 

e lay sleeping on the bed 



 the huzzy she cried shaking 
her fist at the form of the unconscious 
girl to steal my hard earnings and 
arter i d given her a home and a bed 
without so much as axing her name 
but i ll have justice that i will 
luke to jail with the trollop 

 i tell you what it is aunt ex 
claimed luke with his gaze rivetted 
to the face of the lovely girl pro 
mise me that you will not consign this 
child to the care of the police until to 
morrow morning and i give you my 
word that before sunrise your five 
thousand dollars shall be safe in your 
hands again 

 you never yet broke your word 
to me luke you re got my promise 
but mind you keep yours hush 
she wakes 

the lids of the sleeper fringed with 
long dark lashes slowly unclosed and 
her eyes large dark and brilliant 
gazed wonderingly around -in a mo 
ment the glance of wonder changed 
to one of the deepest terror 

mr father she shrieked 
starting up in the bed and gazing 
fixedly over luke s shoulder 

luke turned hastily around the 
rev dr pyne stood by his side with 
his smooth face all radiant with an 
xpression whose doubtful meaning of 
malignancy and triumph luke found 
it difficult to fathom 

 my father again shrieked the 
rirl crouching up in the bed with her 
imbs all huddled together as though 
she anticipated a violent blow 

 my child you please me said 
brother pyne mildly you recog 
nize your parent you repent your 
ate flight from his roof you will 
return to your home 



 



the forger 



 to uie prison shrieked the girl 
 to the cell to the gibbet anywhere 
you please but not to him for 
god s sake good woman do with me 
what you will but save me from his 
power he is my father but sooner 
than return to his roof again i would 
drag out the life of a convict within a 
dungeon s walls i would beg my bread 
on the highway i would i would 
stand back from the bedside back 
back i say or you will drive me 
mad ah ah i see it all again 
that scene the night i fled from your 
roof oh god oh god 

she fell prostrate on the bed her 
limbs writhing in a convulsive spasm 
while her cheek grew like death and 
the white foam hung on her livid lips

some credulous historians would have 
us believe that in the time of catha

was carried to such perfection that a

would send the victim quietly to his

vou know that there are poisons so

with marks of violence 

 not a bit of it livingstone no

mysteries of nature for fear we ll 
abuse our gift why livingstone 
d ye know that were this secret and 
most ubtle poison generally known 



half the men in town would give their 
wives an eternal leave of absence 
and vice versa precious world we d 
have 

 ha ha ha doctor you take 
such an original view of things by- 
the-bye have you seen my wife this 
morning did she expect me back 
from new york so soon 

 saw mrs livingstone this morn 
ing and cautioned her about your dis 
ease egad albert you must be very 
careful ticklish dsease that one 
moment lively as a bird the next 
stiff as a poker have you seen 
harry clay lately grand speech 
that his farewell to the senate wait 
a moment and i ll go round to the sta 
ble and order the servant to trot him 
out would you like to see a manu- 
script volume of mine on the theory 
of poisons here it is in this cabinet 
just take a peep at it while i run round 
and have henry clay brought to the 
front door put it back in the cabinet 
when you ve gratified your curiosity 
back in a minute livingstone 

livingstone took the small volume 
of manuscript in his hand and eagerly 
turned over the leaves he was alone 
he stood in mctorniquet s museum 
surrounded by shelves piled with sur 
gical curiosities preserved in jars or 
hanging by parti-colored strings or 
yet again huddled carelessly together 
the very air was reminiscent of the 
scalpel and the torniquet dead men 
in fragments in great pieces and little 
in all shapes and every form wero 
scattered around in the full light 
of the window fashioned in the ceiling 
of the room stood a grisly skeleton 
one hand placed on his thigh-bone 
while the other with the fingers stuck 



iso 



the forger 



in the cavity of the nose seemed per 
forming the stale jest common with 
he boys along the street you 
can t come it mister by no manner o 
means that gesture said as plainly 
as a skeleton s gesture can say 

 in the days of catharine de 
medicis murmured livingstone 
reading from the manuscript volume 
 there was prepared by her com 
mand a poison combining in its na 
ture the most deadly chemical attri 
butes this poison laid its victim 
down in the sleep of death without a 
mark of violence without the slightest 
sign of murder to tell the tale of an 
untimely death subtle and penetra 
ting in its nature most fearfully op 
posed to the principle of life in its 
mildest form this poison was pre 
pared by the alchemist ellarbin 
d zoisboigne after the study of 
years passed in searching for the 
grand secret the water of life 
the alchemist sold the poison to the 
queen for the price of ene of her 
royal jewels secure of the deadly 
preparation and aware of the manner 
in which it was to be used the queen 
determined that the secret of its com 
position should rest with her alone 
the alchemist was her first victim 
among various strange legends of 
medical lore the poison its various 
qualities and the secret of its prepa 
ration have descended to modern 
times it is prepared thus 

livingstone paused the terrible 
idea which had rested upon his brain 
since the scene of the past night 
now began to take form and shape 
he saw the horrible path which he 
was doomed to tread more clearly 
and distinctly in its minutest windings 



he listened intently for a singia 
moment there was no sound of the 
doctor s returning footstep the 
museum was still as the grave and 
yet as the fatal idea rose blackening 
livingstone s brain with all its details 
of horror the very air of the room 
grew stifling and he could distinctly 
hear the beatings of his own heart 

ere another moment passed seizing 
a lancet which lay on an adjoining 
shelf with a calm and cautious move 
ment livingstone severed the leaf 
which he had just read from the 
manuscript volume and folding it in 
letter form placed it within the breast 
of his overcoat 

 close to the keepsakes next to 
my heart he grimly smiled as he 
placed the manuscript volume in the 
cabinet again three days ago i 
little dreamed that catharine de medi 
cis would become serviceable to me 

he quietly passed from the room 
and from the house hurrying along 
the crowded street in the course of 
fifteen minutes he arrived before his 
stately mansion at the very door he 
was met by luke harvey who had 
just returned from his visit to the 
widow smolby s house 

 is it noon exclaimed luke 
with a quiet smile here are the 
fruits of my morning s labors 

he placed in the merchant s hands 
he memorandum which he had taken 
from the stolen watch 

livingstone started but in an instant 
recovered the fearful composure whicn 
had marked his demeanor since the 
fatal scene at monk-hall 

 i bear it well do i not luke 
be calmly exclaimed so-so he 
s-nojlpnly the the adulterer but 



the poison of catharine de mediclj 



the swindle and forger we can 
settle both accounts at once 

there is enough in that slight 
memorandum to excite suspicion 
exclaimed luke but not enough to 
produce conviction leave the mat 
ter in my hands and before friday 
night that s to-morrow the fellow 
will be in the hands of the police 

 to-morrow morning dora and i 
start for hawkwood replied liv 
ingstone with a slight smile by- 
the-bye while you are procuring the 
necessary documents for the convic 
tion of the forger we must be sure 
that he does not leave the city ha 
ha i have it let us walk down 
the street while i let you into my 
plans 

they were walking down the street 
whispering earnestly together when 
a hand was laid upon livingstone s 
shoulder 

 look here curnel you don t 
forgit old friends do you said a 
bluff voice which sounded very much 
like the deep bass of an oysterman 

 why larkspur is that you i d 
scarcely have known you why 
what s the matter with you 

nothin much only there was 
a change in the admineystration 
easy larkspur was turned out kon- 
sekence is he persents a pictur for the 
portrait painter and the daily papers 
does not he 

easy larkspur as the new comer 
was styled certainly presented a pic 
ture and a very remarkable picture it 
was too he was a short stout man 
with broad shoulders and a tolerably 
corpulent person his face was re 
markable for its crimson hue and its 
immensity of jaw or cheek as the 



reader pleases his cost -me was at 
once picturesque and simple a short 
gray roundabout exhibiting glimpses 
of a saffron shirt at the elbows and 
buttoned up to the neck across his 
muscular chest corduroy trowsers 
reaching to the calf agreeably varie 
gated with patches of various colors 
and a pair of shoes rather the worse 
for the wear with the heels worn 
away all at one side and picturesque 
crevices near the toes easy lark 
spur wore no stockings such things 
as stockings had been invented long 
after man had departed from his pri 
mitive simplicity of manners easy 
larkspur was above wearing stock 
ings the hat which surmounted mr 
larkspur s broad face was quite a 
curiosity in its way in material it 
was rather flimsy being fashioned 
of common straw in shape it was 
singular bearing a strong resem 
blance to nothing in heaven above or 
on earth beneath or in the waters 
under the earth speculative people 
would have called it a shocking bad 
hat you might have fallen down 
and worshipped it without any viola 
tion of the commandment the pic 
turesque appearance of the hat was 
rather increased by a glimpse of a 
dingy red handkerchief which peeped 
from the crevices of the crown like a 
quiet observer taking a view of the 
world from a favorable elevation 

 why larkspur where have you 
been all this while 

 two years ago i was turned out 
of the police since that time i ve 
been perambulating the continent 
part of the time as a tuppy graphical 
ingineer i carried the chain on the 
railroad part of the time i was in- 



j 



the forger 



gaged in the mercantile marine ser 
vice drove the horse on the canavvl 
i attributes the present depression of 
my funds to the cursed whig tariff of 
 it must be tint for deuce take 
me if i know what else it can be 

 larkspur would you like to earn 
a hundred dollars 

 jist try me i m putty desp rate 
now i tell you i might accept 

 could you assume the manners 
of a soutnern planter 

 what d ye mean swear a few 
big oaths carry a bowie knife and 
talk about my niggers i jist could 
do that and nothing else 

go down to my store in front 
street larkspur and wait for me 
said livingstone turning toward his 
mansion again luke attend to 
the accomplice of the forger in the 
den of monk-hall i ll see that the 
forger himself does not leave the 
city 

it was in this state of mind with 
his plans of vengeance fully matured 
and his soul determined upon the pro 
secution of those plans that living 
stone sought the presence of his wife 
and passed through the scene in her 
boudoir which we have already de 
scribed 

 the girl is beautiful luke so 
liloquized as livingstone and larkspur 
passed on their separate ways leaving 
him alone in the street beautiful 
as a dream pshaw luke this folly 
ought not to move you again jilted 
once and again in love and with 
whom a nobody who coming from 
nowhere knocks at old widow smol- 
by s door and begs admittance but 



see chapter fourth dora livingstone 



won t give her name fat pyne her 
father too hum that s suspicious 
to say the least aunt smolby pro 
mised that the girl should noi leave 
her roof until she heard from me 
there s mystery about the thing take 
it as you will and so as i said last 
night when hurrying down this very 
street i say now to monk-hall 



chapter seventh 
the council of war 

 i have gathered the fruit and it 
is ashes 

lorrimer was alone in the rose 
chamber the light of the candle 
fast waning to the socket streamed in 
fitful flashes over his wan and pallid 
face thus had he sate for hours his 
arms crossed over his breast his face 
drooped low on his clasped hands 
while his hazel eyes glanced vacantly 
in the flickering light form beneath the 
shadow of his corrugated brows thus 
had he sate while the morning dawn 
ed over river and steeple and roof j 
and as the day wore on filling the 
darkest nooks and avenues of the old 
city with the noonday beams of the 
winter sun he remained silent and 
alone stricken with a strange apathy 
his very soul impressed with a fea 
whose nature he might not analyze 
and his heart imbued with a terrible 
remorse for the irreparable wrong 

 i have gathered the fruit and it is 
ashes he murmured oh would 
to heaven that before the commission 
of this wrong i had known my heart 
would that i had felt twelve hours 



the council of war 



 



ago now dear this girl would have 
been to me as a wife how she 
would have wound herself into my 
heart and grown into my very exis 
tence the life of my life and of my 
oul a better and a purer soul 
curses eternal curses upon the creed 
of the heart-cankered worldling which 
has dragged mary to ruin and which 
will ha ha ha within a few brief 
days hasten her wronger to an un 
timely and unwept death 

 death echoed a hoarse voice 
short word that but good as a 
med cin to cure some disorders i 
say monk gusty what shall we do 
with the feller 

with byrnewood muttered 
lorrimer turning his head slowly 
round and gazing upon the form of 
devil bug who stood at his side with 
his usual hideous grin with byrne- 
wood you mean 

 with byrnewood or the feller jist 
as you like about these times i kon- 
siders him a putty disagreeable feller 
i does that he s a-layin on the floor 
of the walnut room half dead with 
opium and all sorts o drugs he 
won t come to his senses for hours 
yet but gusty what shall we do 
with him when he does come to his 
senses that s the pint which i wants 
to argur 

 and the gal what shall we do 
with the gal interrupted a voice pro 
ceeding from the other side of the 
room she s been sleepin in the 
painted chamber ever since daylight 
at fust she took on considerable but 
a drop o laud num in her coffee set 
tled that business what shall i tell 
her ven she vakes 

mother nancy with her sharp fea 



tures and colloped cheeks twisted into 
an expression of sneering malignity 
approached lorrimer and laid her 
withered hand upon his shoulder 

tell her what you please but 
leave me to myself and as lorri 
mer spoke his brow darkened with 
a frown and devil-bug mark me 
i would be alone 

 very well ve-r-y well when 
the feller gits over the opium i ll axe 
him down stairs very perlitely and 
tell him to dig off vender how that 
 vork he won t come back with 
the poleese o course not monk 
gusty won t be jugged up for makin 
too free with another man s darter 
the feller s a nateral born fool what

mother nancy squaring her elbows 
 it may suit you to sit here mopin 
and mopin over spilt milk but it 
don t suit me tell you suppose 
this young chap byrnewood or 
byrnecoal or whatever his name is

konsekence monk-hall will be torn 
up root and branch and 

 our leetle family joys walked into 
like bricks suggested devil-bug 
 cuss that light how it flares 

 and what remedy do you pro 
pose exclaimed lorrimer as his 
face changed to a death-like pallor 
was illumined by a sudden glare of 
light 

 i perpose to keep a tight hold on 
the gal said mother nancy with a 
pleasant smile nothin like bein 
on the safe side and then gusty 
you can have a little bird to yerself 
all in this old cage of monk-hall and 
no body be the wiser 



 



the forger 



 and as for byrne wood suggest 
ed lorrimer turning to devil-bug 

 i perpose to keep a tight hold on 
him too 

the face of the doorkeeper of 
monk-hall was crossed by a hideous 
smile his solitary eye glared with 
sudden intensity and the muscles of 
his countenance were agitated for a 
single moment by a violent and con 
vulsive movement 

 what mean you exclaimed 
lorrimer starting with involuntary 
terror as he beheld the purpose of 
devil-bug s soul gleaming from his 
loathsome face 

 cuss it how that light flickers in 
the socket devil-bug calmly an 
swered raising his hand to his pro 
tuberant brow and smoothing the 
matted hair to one side what do 
i mean he continued gazing at lor- 
rime through the outspread fingers of 
his hand nothin o konsekence 
only the young feller will not come 
to his senses till long arter dark and 
then and then cuss the light it s 
gone out 

the libertine and his minions were 
enveloped in sudden darkness 



chapter eighth 
major rappahannock mulhill 

arrayed in all the paraphernalia 
jf his walking costume fitz-cowles 
was threading his way among the 
crowd of loiterers who daily occupy 
the pavement in front of independence 
hall his brow was clouded by a 
 ltnd once or twice as he walked 



along he allowed his gold-headed 
cane to fall on the hard bricks with a 
ringing sound it was evident thaf 
the gallant colonel in all the glory 
of his original hat his tight-fitting 
overcoat his long dark hair his white 
kid gloves and gold-headed cane was 
still somewhat ruffled in temper and 
disturbed in soul 

 this woman he muttered 
 gad i never knew her match 
bold reckless and dangerous i 
must take care dora with her im 
prudence may frustrate all my 
schemes and scatter my fortunes to 
the wind i stand upon a dangerous 
height a step higher and i arrive 
at the object of all my desires un 
limited wealth and safety a step 
lower a single misplaced movement 
and ugh the prison the convict s 
cell and it makes my flesh creep 
the lash are mine j 

ah ha fitz-cowles i ve just 
been seeking for you 

 is that you livingstone which 
way are you bound up chesnut 
street or down 

colonel fitz-cowles allow me 
to make you acquainted with major 
rappanhannock mulhill of mulhill 
plantation south carolina a planter 
from the south colonel suggested 
livingstone in a whisper rich as 
girard lands without limit and a 
gold mine 

 i am proud of your acquaintance 
sir replied fitz-cowles graciously 
extending his hand to the stranger 
 queer specimen of a planter he 
muttered to himself wonder if 
he s keen at the cards i must try 
him at faro 

 sur happy of the honor i like 



major rappahannock mulhill 



you you re of the right stripe the 
real pig as we say at mulhill ob 
served the southern planter clapping 
fitz-cowles on the back may i be 
cussed curnel if i don t think you re 
got the real allegator eye which give 
sich wiwacity to the phizzes of us 
bloods from down south 

col fitz-cowles had seen many 
queer specimens of the southern 
planter but this gentleman was deci 
dedly the queerest of all rappahan- 
nock mulhill was a stout thickset 
gentleman with a round red face 
and a corpulent paunch his dress 
was at once singular and effective fas 
the playbills have itgt a broad- 
brimmed hat of raw felt with a 
round crown and a long blue cord to 
which was appended a tassel that hung 
drooping to the major s shoulders a 
deep crimson velvet waistcoat double- 
breasted and buttoned up to the 
throat pants made very full and 
wide and striped like fancy bed -tick 
ing a sky blue coat with glaring 
metal buttons yellow buckskin 
gloves tight boots of patent french 
leather and a check neckerchief tied 
in an enormous bow and affording 
free play to the colossal shirt collar 
which rose to the major s ears had 
you seen the major thus attired walk 
ing along chesnut street you would 
have said that there was only one 
thing wanting to complete the general 
finish of his appearance a cane of 
the proper style and dimensions this 
want was supplied by an enormous 
stick or club which the major grasped 
in his right hand bending in a 
dozen ways all twisted and curled 
and knotted it looked as though it 
might have been the root of the ta 



riff which politicians have been en 
deavoring to find for years 

 how did you leave all the folks 
down south major 

 lively replied the major pull 
ing up his shirt collar lively 
roasted ar abolitionist the day afore 
i left for tryin to steal my niggers 
lynched a yankee the day afore that 
for sellin me some jersey cider for 
sham-pane things is werry lively 
in our diggins jist now 

 i suppose you ve been in a few 
knock-downs in your time observed 
fitz-cowles condescendingly 

 can t say much for my skill in 
that line curnel replied the major 
still tugging away at his shirt collar 
while he grew suddenly red in the 
face killed four or five fellers in a 
duel took em one after another 
had to pay their funeral expenses 
very low business the sheriff had 
the impoodence to get a warrant out 
for me there it is i ve preserved 
it to this day as a coorosity 

 why it looks quite fresh ob 
served fitz-cowles looking at the 
document which mulhill held in his 
extended hand very fresh in 
deed 

 oh that s because i have kept it 
in spirits a warrant s sich a coorosity 
down south 

 colonel if you ll excuse me i 
wish to speak a word with the major 
before i resign him to your care 
major will you walk this way a mo 
ment 

he led the major beyond the hear 
ing of fitz-cowles and glanced quiet 
ly over his shoulder at the millionaire 
as he spoke 

 larkspur how can you be so 



 



the forger 



hazardous exclaimed livingstone 
 his name on that very warrant and 
the signature of the mayor at the bot 
tom 

 werry true replied easy lark 
spur alias rappahannock mulhill 
 werry true the ma or swore me 
in as depitty poleesman he he

ed livingstone in a deep and hurried 
tone remember the injunctions

that business has been settled you are 
to hang on to fitz-cowles until all

 don t i good mornin living 
stone he added aloud as strutting 
to fitz-cowles side he waved his 
hand to the merchant call and 
see us at the ton house when you ve 
time 

u what a monster muttered fitz- 
cowles red vest and blue coat 
however there s money to be made 
by cultivating this creature walk 
up to the ton house major and 
smoke a cigar he added aloud in 
the most insinuating tone imaginable 

 i always carries my appeyratus 
with me said the major taking a 
box of lucifer matches from one 
pocket and a large german pipe from 
ae other nothin like bein per- 
vided with these things in case of ac 



cident tain t fashionable to smoko 
a pipe in chesnut street is it curnel t 
never mind we re the rale alleyga- 
ters we are 

and taking the colonel s arm with- 
in his own the major strutted down 
chesnut street his immense pipe at 
tracting the attention of all bystanders 
while fitz-cowles regarded both pipe 
and planter with a look of smothered 
disgust 

ha ha ha chuckled living 
stone as he gazed after the retreating 
pair the handsome millionaire 
arm in arm with a pojice officer 



chapter ninth 

the dead-vault of monk-hall 

the beams of the lanthern flashed 
over a wide cellar whose arched roof 
was supported by massive pillars of 
unplastered brick here and there 
as the flickering light glanced fitfully 
along the dark recesses of the place 
fragments of wood might be discover- 
ed scattered carelessly around the 
pillars or thrown over the floor in 
crumbling heaps 

every moment as the light of the 
lanthern shifted from side to side 
some new wonder was discovered 
now the solid plastering of the ceiling 
now the massive oak of the floor no 
the uncouth forms of the pillars with 
loose bricks and crumbling pieces of 
wood scattered around and now ag 
a gleam of light shot suddenly into the 
distant recesses of the cellar a long 
row of coffins might be discovered with 
the lids broken off and the bones of 



the dead-vault of monk-hall 



 



the dead thrown rudely from their 
last resting place 

the extent of the cellar might not 
be ascertained by the uncertain light 
of the lanthern it may have been a 
hundred feet in extent or even two 
hundred but whenever the light 
flared up it disclosed some dark recess 
filled with crumbling coffins or laid 
bare some obscure nook where ghast 
ly skulls and fragments of the human 
skeleton were thrown together like 
old lumber in a storehouse 

even where the lanthern stood in 
a square described by four massive 
pillars which arising from the oaken 
floor supported the arching ceiling 
its light gleamed over a skeleton with 
the various bones separated by time 
and the jaw with its bristling teeth 
falling apart from the blackened skull 

the sound of a footstep rung echo 
ing among the arches of the cellar 
with a hollow sound and in a mo 
ment ere the figure of the intruder 
might be seen the murmur of a hu 
man voice mingled with the echo of 
the footstep 

 ha ha ha while the broad 
cloth gentry of the quaker city guz 
zle their champaigne two stories above 
here in these cozy cellars of monk- 
hall old devil-bug entertains the 
thieves and cut-throats of the town 
with scorchin jamakey spirits and 
raw moneygehaley hark how the 
fellers laugh and shout in the next 
cellar 

and the chorus of a rude drinking 
song chaunted first by a single voice 
then echoed by a score came faint 
and murmuring through the thick 
walls of the adjoining cellar 



 let the bank d rector swill his sha n-pane 
it s pisen d with orphan s tears 

raw jamakey we ll drink and drink again 
for d a beak we fears 

 that s what i likes said devil- 
bug as he came shuffling onwah 
into the light of the lanthern i 
usually wisits my private partments 
bout once a day just to see how the 
boys gets on this place is what i 
calls my study he he he the 
pawnbroker in the next street ain t in 
partnership with me there ain t no 
secret passage under ground from his 
shop to my cellars we don t kon- 
tract to supply so many thieves an 
cut-throats with vittels lodgin and 
viskey them quest ins is better with 
corks on it don t do for sich likker to 
spill out i tell you 

he disappeared for a moment be 
hind one of the brick pillars and in 
an instant emerged into the light 
again dragging the remnant of a 
coffin at his heels 

 the genelman as used to inhabit 
this konwenient winter and summer 
residence has soffened into dust his 
coffin ill sarve me for a seat turn 
it over that s right now let me 
think hum-hum musketer say 

 yes massa muttered the voice 
of the negro from a distant part of the 
cellar 

 if any one wants to see me tell 
glow-worm to show em down and 
d ye hear you brute do you 
show em in when they are down 
devil-bug s at home for wisiters 

 yes massa muttered the negro 
from the darkness of the cellar and 
then all was silent again 

devil-bug was seated upon the 
coffin with his elbows supported by 



 



the forger 



his knees and his swarthy cheeks 
resting on his thick and heavy fingers 
the full beams of the lanthern glared 
in his face with the matted hair hang 
ing over the protuberant forehead 
while each hideous feature the flat 
nose with the wing-like nostrils the 
wide mouth with the rows of bristling 
teeth the pointed chin rough with a 
short and stubble-like beard the eye 
less socket and the solitary eye all 
were disclosed in strong and glaring 
light as the shadow of his figure 
was flung like a belt of darkness along 
the floor as he sate there with his 
face agitated by various expressions 
all mingled with his habitual sneer 
and scowl he looked like the tutelar 
demon of that vault of death 

 my life s been a purty quiet one 
he soliloquized not many inci 
dents to tell passed my years in the 
comfortible retiracy o domestic felli- 
city as parson pyne would say yet 
there was one adventoore in my life 
queer one that one stormy night 
bout seventeen year ago there comes 
to monk-hall a rale bully of a feller 
with a purty gal on his arm he 
struck her a blow with his fist i 
knocked him down gal liked me 
from that hour ha ha ha the 
thing makes me smile a purty gal 
in love with a handsome man like de 
vil-bug and yit and yit many s 
the night i ve laid at her door a 
watchin her and a-keepin harm 

from her and ho ho ho she 

used to say she loved me cause i 
did nt deceive my looks for one 
year me and that gal was man an 
wife the year passed one night 
she quit monk-hall i ain t never 
heerd on her since and what is a 



werry rimarkible circumstance i 
never think o that gal without m 
heart gettin soft and the water comin 
in my eyes if any other man would 
say that o me i d sue him r ci bel 
hallo who s there 

 monk baltzar massa answered 
the voice of musquito from a distant 
recess of the cellar 

 that s parson pyne s slang 
name muttered devil -bug show 
him in musketer 

and in a moment there came hur 
rying from the darkness which en 
veloped the distant portions of the 
cellar the figure of a man wrapped 
up in a long and drooping black cloak 

 i say abijah what are you doing 
down here he muttered in a surly 
tone from the folds of his cloak as 
he approached devil-bug s lanthern 
 very odd taste this 

 draw a cheer parson exclaim 
ed devil-bug smiling blandly or 
now that i think o it there ain t no 
cheers draw a coffin parson and 
let s have a talk 

i ve no time to stay muttered 
the new-comer as he allowed the folds 
of his cloak to fall from his face and 
discovered the full and beaming visage 
of the rev dr pyne one word 
and i m gone 

 and that word about the gal 
you ve been seekin for three days 

at last i ve lured her to monk- 
hall this morning i discovered her 
hiding place and notwithstanding 
her tears and cries forced her in a 
carriage quieted her with threats and 
but five minutes since smuggled her 
into monkiall 

 more work for me i see what 
was the kontract 



the dead-vault of monk-hall 



 



u you were to give her a potion in 
her drink in order 

 that she might be prepared for 
your wishes 

see that it s done before 
o clock to-night and the hundred dol 
lars are yours 

 i say brother pyne said devil- 
bug with a pleasant smile when 
do you preach again i reely must 
come and hear you is the old ladies 
werry much melted when you gives 
it to the sinners 

 pshaw muttered brother pyne 
moving toward the darkness of the 
cellar you will always have your 
joke remember abijah the potion 
before ten to-night 

he disappeared in the darkness and 
devil-bug was alone once more 

 wonder if there s many more sich 
parsons in the world fine fat-faced 
fellers with round paunches and 
vatery eyes seems to me human 
natur is wery much like a piece of 
putty in a baby s fingers the baby 
can twist that piece of putty into any 
shape he likes and the more the leetle 
crittur twists it the more twist-able it 
becomes the idee-ar of full grown 
human bein s listenin to a steam in- 
gine like that with his mouth belching 
out smoke and blazes all the while 
yes yes he muttered falling into 
the same soliloquizing mood which 
had come over his soul before the en 
trance of the rev mr f a t 
pyne yes yes she was a purty 
gal an i sometimes thinks she s a 
livin yit she never told me nothin 
but her first name an that s on the 
goofd bracelet which she gave me 
i ve got it fast fast under 
and key 



devil-bug was silent the shcuts 
of the revellers in the adjoining cellar 
grew more loud and uproarious yet ha 
heeded them not deep in the heart 
ten of this monster like a withered flowei 
blooming from the very corruption of 
the grave the memory of that fail 
young girl who eighteen years ago 
had sought the shelter of monk-hall 
lay hidden fast entwined around the 
life-cords of his deformed soul 

 oh tell us ye who in the hours of 
infancy have laid upon a mother s 
bosom who have basked in a father s 
smile who have had wealth to bring 
you comfort luxury and a home who 
have sunned in the light of religion 
as you grew toward manhood and 
been warmed into intellectual life by 
the blessing of education oh tell us 
ye who with all these gifts and mer 
cies flung around you by the hand of 
god have after all spurned his laws 
and rotted in your very lives with the 
foul pollution of libertinism and lust 
tell us who shall find most mercy at 
the bar of avenging justice you 
with your prostituted talents gathering 
round your guilty souls so many wit 
nesses of your utter degradation or 
devil-bug the doorkeeper of monk- 
hall in all his monstrous deformity 
of body and intellect yet with one 
redeeming memory gleaming like a 
star from the chaos of his sins 

for him there had never been a 
hurch a bible or a god no ar 
dent messenger of jesus had ever 
spoken to his ears of the god who 
upon the cross for all men v s 
sins and all mankind s salvation 
never never 

lock and in this great city there are 
thousands upon thousands hidden in 



 



the forger 



the nooks and dens of vice who like 
devil-bug of monk-hall have never 
heard that there is a bible a savior 
or a god true when dragged be 
fore the bar of justice as by a lively 
stretch of fancy the mockery 
called for the commission of crimes 
to which the very evils of this mos 
christian community had driven them 
hungry and starving as they were 
these wretches have seen that bible 
lifted up in court heard that savior s 
name lipped over by some official 
anxious for his dinner or heard the 
name of that god profaned by some 
witness greedy to sell his soul for the 
price of a hat this one point stated 
and you have comprised in a focus 
all their knowledge of a bible a sa 
vior or a god 

and this in that great quaker 
city which every sunday lifts its 
demure face to heaven and with 
church-burning girard college and 
bank-robbery hanging around its 
skirts tells the almighty god that it 
has sent missionaries to the isles of 
the sea to the hindoo the turk and 
the hottentot that it feels for the 
spiritual wants of the far-off nations 
to an extent that cannot be measured 
by words while it has not one single 
throb of pity for the poor who starve 
rot and die within its very eye 
sight 

 she wos a purty gal and when- 
over i think of her as i said afore 
my eyes grow watery i struck the 
feller who had laid his hands upon 
her i struck him to the floor i 
b lieve my soul she liked me from 
that hour hullo who s there 

 a littlf igga massa replied 






the voice of musquito still speaking 
from the distant nook of the cellar 

 fitz-cowles niggar muttered 
devil-bug wonder what he can 
be wanting with me 

de high golly cried a voico 
echoing from the darkness of tho 
vault- dis de debbips own den and

ing cautiously toward the lanthern

to mark this ring mark it ses he 
and whenever i send this ring to you 
cause the jew to retire ho ho 
that s what s in the wind is it hur

bending slowly over the light dim 
read the letter which we have already 
aid before the reader 

 to think a nigger like that should 
read and my eddycation neglected 
ten thousand dollars about his person 



the dead- vault of monk-hall

trouble i ve had with him won t i

devil-bug severely re-tire and 
rr-port yesself to head-quarters forth- 
vith 

ha-yah laughed dim as he 
hurried from the cellar dis chile 
know a little more dan rnos folk he 
seen de debbil ha yah once in his 
life anyhow 

devil-bug was alone again shift 
ing the lanthern from its position he 
carefully examined the oaken planks 
of the floor the outlines of a large 
trap-door were discernible with the 
bolt which held it to the floor insert 
ed in the worn and rusted socket 

 trap-door bout ten feet square 
there s a well below it a deep well 
a dark well the d knows how 
deep any individooal gettin a fall 
through that trap-door might stand in 
danger of bein eat up by rats and all 
sorts o wermin in case the fall didn t 
hurt him ten thousand dollars 
buy a snug little farm out west or 
ha ha haif there wos a good tariff 
passed by some o these cussed con 
gressmen devil-bug might go into 

the iron-works pj 
 



 massa exclaimed the voice of 
musquito from the darkness dat ar 
jew is a-comin down stairs 

 let him come answered devil- 
bug it don t cost nothing and 
hark yethe minnit he passes the cellar 
door do you dig off 

having thus spoken devil-bug 
hastily took the lamp from within the 
anthern and poured some oil over 
he rusted bolt of the trap door in 
an instant the bolt yielded to the im 
pulse of his hand and moved quietly 
along the socket 

 all right i ll jist leave the bolt 
a-clingin to the socket by its end 
the slightest touch from my hand 
won t unloose it redikulus i must 
get a cheer for my friend taint nice 
to give a party without cheers 

disappearing behind a brick pillar 
he drew the fragment of another cof 
fin from its resting place and laid it 
down on the floor some six feet from 
the spot where the lanthern stood 

 any genelman a-sittin on that 
cheer will have the hinges o the trap 
door directly at his back with some six 
feet o the trap a-twixt me and him 
the bolt will be right under my foot 
so it will suppose i was to git 
thinkin on some subject and forgit 
myself my foot might unlodge the 
bolt from its socket in the trap door 
k-u-sh-ew-fomo- he continued pro 
ducing a strange hissing sound by 
suddenly forcing his breath through 
his clenched teeth k-u-sh-ew- 
bangf the trap door ud fall and 
 melancholy to re-late as the news 
papers ses some body ud git their 
brains knocked into shad-roe 
off

bijah cried musquito from the dis 
tint extreme of the vault 

 show the genelman in and tell 
him to walk mighty keerful or else 
he might fall through some o them 
cussed holes in the floor 

in a moment a cautious footstep 
was heard and the dim outline of the 
jew s figure became visible as he ad 
vanced along the vault 

 goot eveningsh was his salu 
tation as he approached the lanthern 
 fader abraham vot you dosh in 
dis place 

good arternoon exclaimed 
devil-bug grinning hideously sit 
down an take a cheer 

with a slight shrug of disgust the 
hump-back seated himself upon the 
coffin opposite devil-bug and quietly 
folding his arms over his fragment of 
a body gazed fixedly into the hideous 
face of the door-keeper 

 i say old feller will you smoke 
exclaimed devil-bug taking some se- 
gars from the breast of his coarse out 
er garment which neither frock-coat 
over-coat nor dress-coat was fashion 
ed of dingy canvass with great horn 
buttons running up in front while the 
wide sleeves hung loosely round his 
muscular arms i say old feller will 
you smoke here s yer reglar pax on 
cannon smokers and he displayed 
a number of segars in the bony palm 
of his broad hand or here s yer 
baby-suckers wot aint got no strength 
in them at all take a smoke gabr el 

 i vill take won baby-sucker wot 
ish not doo sthrong replied gabriel 
as reaching forth his hands he seemed 
about advancing toward devil -bug 
 dis plashe is very dampish 

 h- ou wont take the trouble to 



git up exclaimed devil-bug ai 
hastily rising he removed the lanthern 
from its location at his feet to the im 
mediate vicinity of the jew jist 
keep the lanthern there i likes to 
fcon-template beauty in a strong 
light 

the two figures would have made an 
effective picture the lanthern placed 
at the feet of the jew threw a strong 
light over his person while the form of 
devil-bug was wrapt in a sort of 
lively twilight the calm visage of the 
jew rendered even more quiet and 
contemplative by the segar which he 
smoked the unnatural length of his 
face and the absurd disproportion of 
his small and hump-backed body 
which looked more like a shapeless 
lump dressed up in man s attire than 
the frame of a human being all pre- 
sented a vivid contrast to the visage of 
devil-bug its solitary eye glaring 
through the obscurity of the vault like a 
flame coal while his short but stout and 
muscular frame with the heavy body 
knotted into uncouth knobs at the 
shoulders with the long arms and 
bony fists the slim legs and massive 
feet all gave you the idea of a 
sampson stunted in his growth a 
giant whom nature had dwarfed from 
the regular proportion of manly beau- 
tydown into an uncouth image of 
hideous strength 

around the twain extended the 
death-vault of monk-hall its distant 
recesses wrapt in heavy shadow 
while ihe arched ceiling directly over- 
lead the oaken floor around and the 
bur pillars of massive brick were 
now disclosed in strong light as a 
sudden gust of wind agitated the lan 
thern -flame or yet again veiled in a 



the dead-vault of monk-hall 



 



dim shadow which gave a dark and 
dreary appearance to the place 

 i say gabr el wot a pitty it is 
is nt it exclaimed devil-bug as he 
looked forth from the cloud of tobacco- 
amoke which half-concealed his hide 
ous countenance 

 vot ish a bitty 

 that me and you was nt jined 
together with a cord a-passin 
through our witals would nt we 
have made a specymen of siamese 
twins ho ho what a pair of 
beauties 

 what wos dish plashe made fur 
asked gabriel knocking the ashes from 
his segar it looksh like won devil s 
counting-housh bi-gott 

 why ye see gabr el said 
devil-bug in a cheerful way from 
all that i ever heered them fellers as 
used to hold out in these diggins the 
monkses and priestses and nunses 
in the time of the revvylushun made 
a practice o buryin their dead in 
this ere cellar and a lively practice 
it was too they do say there was 
fine goin s-on in the old times in these 
parts i ought to ve been about in 
those days i was born artermy time

gabriel with a look of quiet sarcasm 

now d ye know gabr el that i 
sometimes think i was never born at

pose i was a devil would nt it be a 
lively thing for me to chaw you up

a calm decision of manner that indi

devil-bug playing carelessly with the 
bolt of the trap-door and arter

playing with the bolt the old wo

 i vos and soldt her a goldt watch 
dat ish to say i made her a presentsh

he passed his fingers along the floor 
with a quick movement a jew 
give any body a watch i ll go an 
jine the free repenters arter that 

 vot you scratch your fingersh on

his knees he played with the bou of 
the trap-door why why in fact

the forger 



the word had not passed his lips 
before the bolt flew back from its 
socket there was a creaking noise suc 
ceeded by a crash and the whirring 
sound produced by the falling trap 
door echoed around the death-vault 
devil-bug listened all was darkness 
and silence with the last gleam of 
aght he had beheld the jew tottering 
on the brink of the chasm and now 
he listened for the sound produced by 
the mangled body as it went sweep 
ing through the air to the bottom of 
the well another moment passed 
a sound arose from the depths of the 
well it was the sound of the lanthern 
as it struck against the sides of the 
chasm bending over the well on 
hands and knees devil -bug listened 
with an intensity that forced the cold 
sweat out from his forehead no 
sound came echoing up the chasm 
not even a murmur or a groan 

 he s gone home to his daddy 
muttered devil-bug as rising on his 
feet again he turned in the darkness 
from the edge of the trap door 
 he ll never refuse fat pork agin 
 warrant ye 

f i say vot te teffil you cuts dem 
capersh for said a clear bold voice 
resounding through the darkness of 
the vault got-tam i might have 
fell town and hurtsh mesself vot 
for you actsh like a crashy man 

devil-bug started so certain had 
he been of the jew s death that when 
he heard his voice echoing through 
the darkness it struck him with a 
feeling of supernatural awe in a 
moment however he recovered him 
self and began to crawl around the 
edge of the trap-door in the direction 
from whence the voice had issued 



 he got off did he he muttered 
to himself ha i won t seize him 
by the throat and pitch him into the 
well jist trust me with him a min- 
nit somebody why you see ga- 
br el he added aloud in his blandest 
tone i happened to put my foot on 
the bolt o that cussed hatchway and 
it come loose where are you ga- 
br el i m got somethin pertickter 
to say to you 

 no toudt no toudt responded 
gabriel put i vill keepsh my dish- 
tance fader abraham vot a man 
it ish 

creeping along the floor on hands 
and feet devil-bug approached the 
pillar from whence the voice pro 
ceeded 

 to sarve me sich a trick he 
muttered but i ll bruise him for it 
i ll bruise him 

 i vos a-goin to tellsh you dat 
i drop mine pocketsh-book in de wo 
man smolpy s house ten tousandt 
tollars in it too 

 what s that you say grunted 
devil-bug dropped your pocket- 
book in widow smolby s house you 
are a precious pork-hater to give ten 
thousand dollars for five 

a shrill whistle echoed round the 
vault ringing through nook and cre 
vice with a piercing sound like the 
winter wind shrieking down a chim 
ney 

 what are ye up to growled 
devil-bug as his outspread hands 
grasped the brick pillar jist let me 
have a feel of your hand gabr el 

as he spoke the glare of a lamp 
flashed over the vault devil-bug 
beheld the face of the jew thrust from 
the opposite side of the pillar with the 



the dead-vault of monk-hall 



 



keen aid piercing eyes fixed upon his 
countenance 

 where did that light come from 
he shouted hey gabr el 

turning suddenly he beheld the 
form of a stranger advancing from the 
distant door of the vault with a lighted 
candle in his hand 

i vos jist a-goin to tell you 
exclaimed gabriel as devil-bug was 
occupied in watching the stranger 
who came hastening over the floor of 
the vault tat we can rop te widow 
smolpy s house dosh dat pleash

very afternoon 

 now mister may i axe who you

comer light in hand stood in front 
of the pillar which separated the 
doorkeeper from the jew what s

brick-top responded the stranger 
in a snuffling voice brick-top at 
your service sir my daddy was a 
scavenger and my mammy sold rags 
now you know all about me and my 
family into the bargain how d ye 
feel old cove 

 you re werry familiar young 
man you are exclaimed devil-bug 
as he gazed upon the new comer with 
a suspicious glance 
t brick-top was a tall thin person 
age clad from head to foot in rags 
not ragged clothes nor damaged 
clothes nor shabby genteel clothes 
but absolute and unconditional rags 
his thin face with its aquiline nose 
was spotted all over with large frec- 
kles and a great bunch of fiery red 
hair hung over his forehead down to 
the very eyes the lower part of his 



face was hedged in by a thick beard 
of the same fiery red as his matted 
hair while his eyes keen dark and 
brilliant presented a strange contrast 
to the vacant and unmeaning expres 
sion of his freckled countenance 

 yer daddy was a scavenger and 
yer mammy sold rags it s my opi 
nion young man that yer mammy 
must a-dressed you up in her rag shop 
and that yer daddy got mad with you

accustomed delightful chuckle come

than nited states bank stock 

and the three pleasant companions 
hastened from the death-vault of 
monk-hall devil-bug and gabriel

dued tones while brick-top follow

berance of spirit by various strange 
gestures and mysterious expressions

dozen divvils to manage us it would 
she added by way of a parting sa- 
lulfb as she was heard descending the 
stairs 

 it s about seventeen years this 
day muttered the old woman quietly 
seating herself in the capacious arm 
chair placed in front of the fire place 
 seventeen years since she died 
seventeen years since i have had a 
fire made in this room hum-hum 
so brother pyne was that gal s father 
the trollop to run away from her 
own father s house howsomever

and dul dul peg i say what was 
my third husband s name oh she 
aint here dulcombe or dulman 

or yes that s it dulpins and 

what was i a-goin to say 

the old lady glanced around the 
room with a puzzled look the 
ghost-room was perfectly still and 
quiet the faint wood fire flickering 
over the hearth every now and then 
flared up in a sudden flash dispelling 
the dim shadows which rested upon 
the corners of the chamber as the 
fire died away the light of the soli 
tary candle standing upon the work 
table at the old lady s side fell with 
glaring lustre around its immediate 
vicinity while the farther extremes of 
the room were wrapt in dusky sha 
dow the massive bed with its 
heavy curtains rose in the obscure 
air like a mausoleum for the dead the 
circular mirror standing on the an 
tique dressing bureau as ever and 
anon it received a gleam of light on 
its polished surface looked like one 



of those niirrors in which you are 
afraid to gaze when alone in the si 
lence of night for fear a ghostly face 
may peer over your shoulder in the 
glass and the thick hangings de 
pending from the windows waved 
slowly to and fro as occasional gusts 
of wind came moaning through the 
crevices of the chamber door 

the picture above the mantel as 
the light trembled over its surface as 
sumed the appearance of reality and 
for a moment ever and anon it would 
seem animate with a sudden life the 
deep lustrous dark eyes the pale face 
blooming with a rose-bud freshness in 
the centre of either cheek and strik 
ingly relieved by the long black hair 
twining around the neck and falling 
over the bosom in glossy curls seemed 
warming into life while it gazed with 
a sad and melancholy gaze upon the 
wrinkled visage of the old woman 
seated by the fireside 

 murder mur-der screamed the 
parrot from his cage which was hung 
beside the portrait murder fi-er 

now abe cried the widow 
smolby starting from her reverie r 
 that s a lie i was not a-goin to

the old lady gazed fondly into the 
faces of her four cats grouped around 
the fire place like pieces of dutch 
statuary as though she awaited thetf 
answer to her lamentations

 ike-y she exclaimed gazing in 
the countenance of a very vicious tor 
toise-shelled cat you wos very 
naughty to per-voke that abe this

that s a good wesley and she patted 
the back of a cat whose coat display 
ed an uniform of sky-blue and white

in a tone of mock severity to a large 
and lubberly white cat and as 
for you nappy nappy was a 
small black cat with spiteful green 
eyes and as for you nappy you 
don t do nothin but spin from morn 
in till night 

attracted by the sound of the old 
woman s voice the four cats arose 
from their sleeping postures and be 
gan to rub their sleek fur against her 
dress while they exhibited their de 
light by purring to a lively tune 

 ikey spins werry coarse soli 
loquize the old woman i feel very 
heavy now that i come to think of it 
i b lieve i ll lay down a bit 

she moved toward the bed with the 
cats following at her heels and in a mo 
ment disappeared within the curtains 

i ve never laid in this bed her 
voice resounded from within the hang 
ings since the day afore she died

the old lady was asleep the par 
rot in a fit of violent misanthrophy 
laid his head between his wings and 
muffled himself up in those very wings 
like a traveller in his cloak the room 
was perfectly quiet the silence un 
broken by a sound save the purring 
noise made by the cats as they clus 
tered round the sleeping widow 

this entire quietude continued for 
the space of ten minutes or more 
when it was disturbed by the opening 
of the chamber-door 

the withered face of peggy grud 
was thrust through the aperture 

 aslaape is she an cut me aff 
wid a shillin the likes on her to 
thry that game wid me a ter my long 
sarvice wait till three o clock 
comes jest wait 

closing the door peggy hurried 
down the dark stairway instead of 
making her way to the basement 
kitchen her usual resort she entered 
the front room on the first floor and 
sate down by the table on which a 
light was burning 

the laud num in the coffee settled 
her hash she muttered squaring her 
elbows as her withered face was 
wrinkled by a sickly smile the 
front door aint on the jar divvil the

peggy rose from her seat and 
moved toward the door of the room 

 troth it plashes me cut me a-ff 
wid a shillin indaade she exclaimed 
as she closed the door and disappear 
ed faix she may be cut a-ff wid 
something besides a shillin sorrow to 
to her sowl 

the room was not long left to si 
lence and solitude peggy had not 
disappeared more than five minutes 
when the front door of the mansion 
creaked harshly on its rusty hinges 
footsteps were heard in the entry and 
and the door leading from the entry 
into the front room swung slowly open 

 dish is de plashe exclaimed a 
voice in a deep whisper and the di 
minutive form of a hump-backed man 
lad in a threadbare cloak with an 
immense white hat concealing his face 
from view strode softly into the room 
 dish is de plashe now for mine 
pockets-booksh vich he added in a 
tone of quiet glee vich i nefer did 
lost 

ere another moment passed two 
other figures wrapped in threadbare 
cloaks like the first stole cautiously 
into the room and approached the 
light which burned dimly on the small 
table in the centre 

i say gabr el bolt the door 
said the stoutest figure of the three 
u let s have a quiet time to ourselves 
ho ho ho robbin a house in 
broad daylight it tickles me it does 
now genelmen to your posts two on 
us must go up stairs while the tother 
one watches below will you watch 
in this ere room gabr el 

 fader abraham viles you has

py no meansh 

 what d ye say brick-top will 
ye keep watch down stairs 

 jist as this ere convention of the 
sovreign people may decide re 
plied the gentleman addressed quietly 
taking his seat by the table but 
fair play ye mind i m to have my 
thirds out o this estate as the irish 
widder said whem she fit with fourteen 
children for thirteen potatoes and a 
salt mackerel go up stairs boys and 
remove the deposits we re the rale 
dimmycrats we are jy 

 gabr el they re a-waitin prayer 
for us exclaimed devil -bug as his 
solitary eye twinkled from beneath 
the shadow of his ponderous hat 
up stairs gabr el up stairs andjine 
in prayer for the health o the old 
lady 

they hastened from the room and 
in a moment were heard ascending 
the stairs while their companion the 
contemplative brick-top remained 
seated beside the table in the front 
room 

 this is lively they go up stairs 
they commence rummaging the front 
room meanwhile there is no one on 
the look out for them oh no don t 
think of such a thing having plun 
dered the front room on the third 
story they try the back room door 
and find it locked this excites their 
curiosity they break open the door 
and -find themselves in the arms of 
easy larkspur and twelve polict 
officers 

it was singular to note the change 
which came over brick-top s voice 
and manner as he sate by the table 



 



the forger 



muttering mysterious words to him 
self in a tone of quiet satisfaction 
his voice suddenly lost all its vaga 
bond-hoarsness and his manner was 
utterly unlike the manner of the devil- 
may-care loafer whom devil-bug and 
von gelt had left in the front room 
as their sentinel 

suddenly rising from his seat 
 brick-top turned his face from the 
light as he bent over a small wash- 
stand in an obscure corner of the 
room it was very singular that a 
gentleman of his free-and-easy habits 
should take the trouble to wash his 
face but judging from the gestures of 
brick-top as he stood with his back 
to the light he was certainly occupied 
in this vital act of turkish devotion 
in a moment he turned toward the 
light again and as a farmer strips a 
stalk of corn of all superfluous leaves 
so brick-top passing his hands 
rapidly up and down his person 
stripped his costume of manifold rags 
entirely from his tall figure and lo 
he stood disclosed in the beams of 
the candle a very respectable gentle 
man attired in a frock coat and pants 
of glossy broadcloth his uncouth 
red hair hanging over his very eyes 
still gave him a most villianous air of 
decayed loaferism but this he treated 
with the same disrespect as his cos 
tume of rags 

 faugh how that red wig 
stinks cried brick-top flinging 
ins head of hair to the other side of 
the room i flatter myself i did the 
 loafer rather genteely ha ha 
luke it wasn t so bad for you my 
name is brick-top gemmen my 
daddy wos a scavenger and my 
nommy sold rags ha ha ha 



luke harvey dressedjn his usuai 
costume with the paint jmd freckles 
washed from his ace stood disclosed 
in the light 

 dressed myself in a small rag- 
shop this morning and prowled about 
the avenues leading to monk-hall 
met the jew introduced myself as a 
ruffian out of business closed the 
bargain with him to help rob this 
house went to the police office en 
gaged twelve fellows with red noses 
and agreeable complexions gave 
their leader easy larkspur the pass 
key to the small door at the back of 
this house which opens into the pri 
vate staircase leading up into the bacli 
room on the third story the ol 
lady sleeps there in the afternoon 
the police were to warn her of hei 
danger and the old lady and the 
girl i suppose are safe in the garret 
while devil-bug and von gelt are 
being trapped in the midst of their 
plunder at all events the police 
are close at hand they are there 
at this moment waiting for their prey 
ha let me listen 

advancing to the foot of the stairs 
he listened with silent intensity for a 
single moment not a sound came 
echoing down the dark staircase all 
was silent as though no robber s foot 
pressed the floors of the old mansion 

 let me once have the jew in my 
power and then fitz-cowles is a 
doomed man was not that a shriek 
 will buy the documents by offering 
the jew his liberty and all his share 
of the ill-gotten money into the bar 
gain ha the police are upon 
hem i hear them fighting up 
stairs as for devil-bug it rather 
sains me to bring the old fellow tc 



devil-bug in the ghost-room 



 



harm s door egad but they re at j was moving in the direction wheru 
 t up stairs jfo doubt he has com- he supposed the bed was fixed when 
mitted crimesjmough to sink a ship his foot slipped from under him and 



even if each separate crime weighed 
no more than a pebble on the sea 
shore but he s an honest oldirjogue 
for all that and the oath of our 
club prevented me from betraying 
the haunts of monk-hall to the police 
so i had to lure the jew from its cozy 
old nooks and cells pity that devil- 
bug came with him ha was not 
ihat a shriek another shriek a 
groan and the tramp of footsteps 
devil-bug fights hard he is scuffl 
ing with the police i ll hurry up 
stairs and see the fun 

a piercing shriek followed by a 
deep-toned shout echoed through the 
chambers of the old mansion luke 
rushed up stairs the noise grew 
louder in the third story the hurried 
tramp of footsteps resounded through 
the mansion and then all was silent 
again luke gained the head of the 
stairway all was dark as the tomb 
no light glaring from an open door 
served to illumine his way stand 
ing at the head of the topmost stair 
luke held his very breath as he 
listened a dark fear and a horrible 
suspicion flashed over his soul not 
a sound struck his ear not even the 
breathing of a man or the rustling of 
a passing footstep 

 this is strange muttered luke 
 but a moment ago the house 
rung with shouts and shrieks and 
now ha this must be the door of 
the ghost-room 

he entered the dark chamber his 
hands outspread while he listened 
with painful intensity for the slightest 
lound he passed over the carpet he 



he fell to the floor 

 the floor is wet he muttered 
with an oath as he endeavored to 
regain the floor curse the thing 
who has been flinging the furniture 
about the room he continued as an 
object a piece of furniture or perhaps 
a chest or a bundle of clothes arrest 
ed his progress and flung him head 
long to the carpet the police must 
have had a d of a schuffle but 
what s become of the old woman and 
the girl 

arising hastily to his feet he rush 
ed down stairs in order to procure a 
light entering the front room once 
more he extended his hands to grasp 
the candlestick and in the very action 
started back with a feeling of horror 
that chilled him to the inmost heart 

his hands which he raised in the 
glare of the light were crimsoned 
with thick red blood 



chapter eleventh 



devil-bug in the ghost-room 

 cuss the stairs they creak as if 
they had the roomatiz keep close 
to my heels gabr el 

yes i dosh whispered the 
jew in reply there ih a light 
take keer now take very goot keer 

ascending the dark staircase with 
a hushed and cautious footstep devil 
bug stood on the landing which gave 
entrance to the back and front rooms 
of the third story a ruddy gleam 



 



the forger 



of light flared out upon the passage 
from within the ghost-room as the 
door hung slightly ajar devil-bug 
advanced a step and listened all 
was silent he pushed the door wide 
open and with gabriel following at 
his heels stood within the confines of 
the ancient chamber the candle 
was still burning upon the table and 
the wood fire flickered fitfully on the 
hearth 

the old woman s a-sleepin on that 
bed muttered devil-bug she 
snores like a trumpet we must be 
keerful have you got the keys 
them false keys 

 vich i took from wax impres 
sions prepared by peggy grud 
here tey ish te trunksh under te 
foots of the te bedt 

devil-bug took the keys in one 
hand the candle in the other and ad 
vanced to the foot of the bed in a 
moment placing the candle upon the 
carpet he swept the bed-hangings 
aside and drew from under the couch 
with a slow and careful movement a 
small chest of dark wood with a key 
hole of peculiar shape 

 bi-gott cried the hebrew who 
ever made use of this favorite oath 
when very much excited i smellsh 
te gooldt already 

 h-u-sh whispered devil-bug 
fixing one of the keys which he 
grasped in his hand in the keyhole 
of the chest be still or i ll damage 
you so the d won t know you 
ha ha there s the yeller boys the 
rale giniwine mulatters 

 fader abraham cried the jew 
rubbing his hands with glee 

with the light extended in one 
hand devil-bug bent slowly down 



and as his every feature was thrown 
out in strong relief he surveyed trie 
prospect disclosed by the opened chest 
with a glance of the deepest satisfac 
tion by his side knelt the jew his 
dark eyes sparkling with delight a 
as he gazed upon the treasures of the 
opened chest the light flared over 
their faces and over the rich stores of 
coin which peeped out from among 
musty parchments and dingy rolls of 
time-eaten manuscript the long face 
of the jew with its regularity of fea 
ture its healthy hues and its deep and 
brilliant eyes was in vivid contrast 
with the hideous countenance of his 
companion the eyeless socket and the 
solitary blazing eye the wide mouth 
and the pointed chin yet in that mo 
ment of intense gratification their 
visages so widely different in detail 
were glowing with the same grinning 
expression of delight and agitated by 
the same grasping lust for gold 

 gott toubloonsh toubloonsh 
muttered the jew thrusting his hands 
eagerly into the chest 

 are ye a nateral born fool mut 
tered devil-bug in a surly tone the 
clink of the pewter ill wake up the 
old woman be quiet while i konsi- 
ders the pecooliar circumstances under 
which we are placed 

and as they bent lowly over the 
chest their eyes feasting on the rich 
store of doubloons the bed hangings 
were agitated by a slight movement 
and in an instant a worn and wither 
ed face whose sharp features were 
rendered painfully distinct by the 
tight-fitting cap of black silk was 
thrust between the purple folds with 
in striking distance of the robbers 
heads 



devil-bug in the ghost room 



 



it was the face of the old woman 
aroused from her sleep by the clink 
ing of her gold with presence of 
mind that would have done honor to 
a general in a battle-field she noticed 
the movements of the robbers without 
so much as a start or a cry of surprise 
and in that instant of silent observation 
she resolved upon her plan of action- 
beneath the side of the be i nearest 
the wall was a small chest in which 
a pair of pistols had been always 
kept by her last husband could she 
slowly drag her form along the mas 
sive couch to the opposite side of the 
bed and extending her hands raise 
the lid of the chest and seize the pis 
tols she had no fears for the result 
while the robbers bent over the chest 
whispering to one another in hushed 
tones she withdrew within the cur 
tains and commenced dragging heiself 
slowly and cautiously along the bed 

i tells you vat it ish whis 
pered the jew dish is too mosh 
monish to take away leetle by leetle 
somepody may come and take it 
afore we come agin let ush put 
down the lid and carry off te chest at 
wonsh 

 was that the old oman moanin in 
her sleep whispered devil-bug 
holding his breath to listen hush 
the bed s a creakin like blazes let 
me go round an take a look at the old 
lady 

arising from the chest he strode 
cautiously around the bed and gazed 
within the curtains all was dark as 
midnight he could hear a sound like 
the hissing of an enraged cat mingled 
with a slight creaking noise 

 the light gabr el he whispered 

 i ll give it to you you ornery 



scoundr l to rob a poor live woman 
in this ere vay screamed a wo 
man s voice from within the curtains 
and the light of a pistol caused by the 
powder flashing in the pan flared 
up in devil-bug s face by that 
momentary gleam of light he beheld 
the form of the old woman crouching 
on the bed in the attitude of an en 
raged tigress preparing to spring a 
pistol extended in each outstretched 
hand while a gleam of superhuman 
malignity shot from her small grey 
eyes 

 rob a poor lone woman will ye 
take that she cried pulling the trig 
ger of the remaining pistol it flashed 
in the pan but missed fire 

them pistols is old fashioned like 
yerself ought to have the rale per 
cushions ha ha ha laughed devil 
bug but his laughter was of brief du 
ration 

with a wild yell gathering all her 
strength for a desperate effort the old 
woman bounded from the bed and in 
an instant came plunging at the 
throat of devil -bug her arms out 
stretched and her long skinny fingers 
clutching him by the face and hair 
she hung upon him like a living 
night-mare her arms gathering con 
vulsively round his neck while her 
long nails dug into his cheeks like 
the talons of a vulture 

help me gabr el muttered 
devil -bug struggling fiercely with the 
old woman give me a lift and i ll 
choke her in a minnit 

gabriel looked up in surprise 
mingled with terror his course was 
taken in a moment closing the lid 
of the small chest heaped with dub- 
loons he gathered it in the embrace 



f 



the forger 



of his long arms and winding his 
dingy cloak round his shoulders 
made towards the door 

 down the back staircase he 
muttered hurrying through the door 
 i vill make my tracks 

the old widow still clung to the 
robber s neck gathering him to her 
withered form in an embrace more 
pressing than maternal with a vio 
lent effort devil-bug raised his arms 
and poising her a moment in the air 
dashed her to the floor in an instant 
she was on her feet again in another 
instant her arms were round his neck 
with one hand gathered in his hair 
and the other clutching him by the 
face 

 what an old crittur not to 
pare her nails muttered devil-bug 
as his face and hands were wet with 
his blood i ll give ye a lesson ye ll 
never forgit i will 

 i ll larn ye to rob a poor lone wo 
man shrieked the widow 

then commenced a contest which 
bufa mtnate ortwo in duration was 
characterized on both sides by all the 
malignant energy of wild beasts fight 
ing for their prey again and again 
devil-bug raised her in his arms and 
dashed her to the floor again and 
again she sprung to her feet and 
vith the bound of a rattlesnake dart 
ing on its victim gathered her hands 
round his throat along the floor 
devil-bug dragged her upsetting 
chairs and tables in the struggle from 
one end of the room to the other with 
the celerity of lightning the combat 
ants passed the old woman muttering 
a suppressed shriek all the while as 
the hand of the robber was pressed 
apon her mouth now around the 



bed now along the hearth scattering 
ashes and firebrands in the air now 
against the wall this desperate fight 
was continued the old woman strug 
gling with supernatural strength for 
jier life and her gold while devil-bug 
with all his muscular vigor his arms 
of iron sinew and his fingers whose 
grasp was like the shutting of a vice 
found for once he had encountered 
an antagonist as determined as him 
self 

 murder mur-der shrieked the 
parrot aroused from his nap by the 
sound of the contest 

 ye ll cry murder will ye cried 
devil-bug mistaking the cry of the 
parrot for a shriek of the old woman 
i ll settle that business for you i 
will 

his teeth were fixedly compressed 
as with one desperate effort he un 
loosed the arms the old woman 
from his throat and grasped her firmly 
by the middle of the body he fixed 
his eye upon a massive knob sur 
mounting one of the brass andirons 
before the fire and as a blacksmith 
raises a hammer in his arms he 
swung the body of the old woman 
suddenly on high she uttered a 
loud and piercing shriek it was her 
last as the blacksmith with his 
muscular arms braced for the blow 
brings the hammer whirling down 
upon the anvil so devil-bug with his 
hideous face all a-flame with rage 
swung the body of the old woman 
wildly over his shoulder and with the 
every impulse of his strength gather 
ed for the effort struck her head her 
long grey hairs streaming wildly all 
the time full against the knob of the 
brass andiron 



devil-bug in the ghost room 



 



he raised her body in the air again 
to repeat the blow but the effort was 
needless the brains of the old wo 
man lay scattered over the hearth 
and the body which devil-bug raised 
in the air was a headless trunk with 
the bleeding fragments of a face and 
skull clinging to the quivering neck 

 b lieve me soul the old ooman s 
hurt muttered devil-bug with a 
ghastly smile as he flung the body 
yet trembling with life to the floor 
 ha ha he shouted standing as 
still as though suddenly frozen to 
stone there s that feller at my 
side with the jaw bruk and the tongue 
stickin out there is just as he fell 
through the trap and there by his 
side is the old woman with the brains 
a-pourin out from the empty skull 
there s two on em now and they ll 
always be with me ah ah i ll 
not stand this i won t why can t 
a feller kill his man or woman and 
have done with em but to have 

em this way always with you 

 he he he begin to vlieve in hell 
now i do 

he stood before the fireplace with 
his back to the portrait the corse 
of the old woman the mangled frag 
ments of a face and skull resting in 
a pool of blood lay at his very heels 
along the hearth in front of him at 
some distance along the floor beside 
the bed stood the candle now flicker 
ing in its socket and flinging a waning 
light around the room the face of 
devil -bug was pale as ashes his 
lips were tightly compressed and his 
solitary eye glared out from the sha 
dow of the overhanging brow like 
the eye of a war-horse with the 
death-arrow in his heart his hands 



hung stiffened by his side rlis entire 
appearance was that of a man whom 
some wierd enchantment is transform 
ing to lifeless stone the cold sweat 
in big and clammy drops streamed 
over his tawny visage and his eye 
grew more vivid and intense in its 
burning gaze 

 hear the critter groan he 
muttered without moving the fraction 
of an inch from his statue-like posi 
tion somethin evil is goin to hap- 
pen to me just as he fell through 
the hatchway his jaw broke and 
his tongue out he lays afore me 
and he moves his blood-shot eyes 
and waggles his tongue and groans 
an groans and the old woman s 
there too she s layin at my back 
i know but there she is at my side 
the brains oozing out from the hol 
low skull 

for a moment the murderer treirv- 
bled from head to foot 

by god he muttered the oath 
with deep emphasis and this was a 
singular thing for devil-bug to do 
for he scarcely ever swore by the 
name of the almighty by god j 
do do begin to b lieve that there 
is a hell 

and around his feet and over the 
heart silently and slowly the blood 
of the murdered woman began to flow 
and spread while the ghastiy corse 
with the hollow skull oozing with 
clotted flesh and brains lay huddled 
in a shapeless heap the hand contort 
ed with the spasm r deathand the stif 
fened limbs fl vg uong the bricks in 
the crouching position peculiar to a 
violent and a bloody death 

murder was in that room in its most 
awful form like a terrible presence 



 



the forger 



it seemed to darken the very air of 
-he room and chill the strong heart 
of the murderer the light flickered 
dimly in the socket and then sank 
down after sudden glare and all was 
dark as midnight 

 it s gone out muttered devil- 
bug as his heart gathered a strange 
courage from the darkness which 
took the sight of all outward objects 
from his view it s gone out why 
shouldn t i fill my pockets with some 
o the old woman s plunder ha ha 
ha why not devil-bug ain t so 
easily skeered i tell ye 

he turned toward the fire-place as 
he spoke he was about to prosecute 
his researches in the darkness when 
the light which he had fancied ex 
tinguished flared up from its socket 
and lit the room with a sudden glare 
that glare was but for an instant 
and yet by its red light devil-bug 
with his face turned to the hearth 
beheld the dark eyes of the portrait 
gazing fixedly upon him he had not 
observed this portrait before but 
now as the pale cheeks glowed in the 
momentary glare of the dying candle 
as the dark eyes grew suddenly bril 



liant and the hair seemed to wav- ii 
float in the ruddy light while tha 
background of this picture the frame 
and all its minor details were wrapt 
in thick darkness devil-bug thought 
he beheld not a portrait or a mere 
piece of inanimate canvass but a 
breathing and living woman whose 
look was fixed upon his face in terri 
ble reproof 

nell he shrieked the gaf 
come to life agin jist as she was 
seventeen years ago ho ho ho 
 do believe there is a god thafs 
a fact 

the light went out and all was 
darkness devil-bug with a wild 
yell fled from the room his footsteps 
echoed through the next chamber and 
in a moment resounded from the pri 
vate stairway leading into the yard 
again and again that wild yell 
mingled with a woman s name broke 
upon the air and then all was still 

silence and darkness and murder 
were only the tenants of the ghost- 
room while the oozing blood began 
to harden over the cold bricks of the 
fire-place 






book the third

mabel 



chapter first from the private staircase and in a 

moment throuffltlhe doorway at its 

luke harvey in the ghost-room 

head there stole the figure of a stout 



luke raised his blood-stained hands 
in the light and stood chained to the 
spot with horror in a moment he 



man wrapped in a thick overcoat 
with a pistol in one hand and a thick 
knotted mace in the other one by 



mastered the dead and icy feeling of j one at his heels there followed twelve 
awe which began to change his very muscular men dressed and armed 
heart to stone he seized the candle like their leader luke neither heard 
he rushed up the stairway and stood nor saw them but stood as if frozen tc 
before the door of the ghost-room j the floor with his head turned away 
the light which he grasped flashed j from the door of the ghost-room 
through the open door of the back- why harvey is that you 
room it was silent and untenanted cried the leader of the band of twelve 
by human being the door opening i has them fellers been here hey 
on the private staircase hung slightly or am i too early easy larkspur 
open luke gazed through the door- is generally too early why what s 
way of the back-room again and again the matter with you man where s 
but his gaze never for a single instant the old woman and the gal strike 
wandered into the ghost-room whose me stoopid if you haint struck 
opened door laid its secret bare to his dumb 

glance luke silently pointed to the ghost- 

he stood at the door with the light room 

in his hand trembling with a strange larkspur seized the candle and 
fear but he dared not enter the followed by the twelve police officers 
room hurriedly rushed into the chamber 



even as he stood footsteps hushed 
end softened came echoing faintly 



there was a pause for a single mo 
ment and then from every man them

yelled one involuntary and awful 
shriek of horror 

by g d we re too late mut 
tered larkspur in a voice whose em- 
phasis of horror was in fearful contrast 
with his usual devil-may-care tones 
 the party has been here afore us 
and finished their job 

 didn t i tell you cried a police 
officer that the feller whom we 
saw shinnin it down the alley as we 
came in the gate was one of the party 
from this house 

 may i be hung for stealin a tooth 
pick from a match boy if this aint a 
leetle a-head of my time exclaimed 
larkspur and luke could hear him 
walking hurriedly up and down the 
room too late boys too late by 
g d 

luke gathered nerve for a sight of 
horror and slowly advancing into the 
room pushed through the band of po 
lice officers and gazed upon the 
mangled corse here s some of the 
fruits of my d d plot to catch the 
thieves he said in a husky voice 
as he gazed upon the shapeless mass 
which but five minutes before had been 
a living and breathing creature 
 larkspur i thought that you were 
hidden in the backroom when i first 
entered the house but no matter it s 
all over now 

his face was white as the death - 
shroud and his upper lip trembled 
with an involuntary movement 

 larkspur he said in a voice 
which did not rise above a whisper 
 search this room and see and 
see if there is not another another 
corpse 

och whilaloo cchone ochone 



murtherin th-a-aves in the house o

came echoing from the main stairway 
of the mansion ochone we re 
ruinated and kilt intirely heard ye 
iver the likes o this 

peggy grud came rushing into the 
room her hair flying about her head 
in wild disorder while with her clasp 
ed hands upraised she rent the air 
with a succession of vivid shrieks 
the police officers were between her 
and the fireplace and the fearful ob 
ject laid along the floor did not 
meet her eyesight 

 will ye git out o this ye mur- 
therin blaggards where s my mis 
thress ochone ochone th-a-aves 
i ll riz the nabor ud on ye where s

luke silently pushed the police 
officers aside and taking peggy grud 
by the hand led her forward 

 there he cried fixing his 
snake-like eye upon her with a glance 
which she dared not face there is 
your mistress 

 murder murder cried the par 
rot rustling about in the cage abovo 
the mantel piece 

peggy grud looked down upon the 
corse and then leaped into the very 
air with a start of unfeigned horror 
uttering shriek after shriek no longer 
feigned by shrewd hypocrisy but 
wrung from her bosom by the hor 
rible sight of the ghastly corse com 
bined with her own guiity fears peggy 
grud sank in a kneeling position 
with her face averted from the dead 
body while she tore her hair in very 
madness

true it was that the favorites of the 
old lady who in the first uproar of the 
contest between her and devil-bug 
had slunk away into the nooks and 
crannies of the room now stole 
forth from their hiding places and 
came purring and moaning round the 
shapeless corse they walked in 
the old woman s blood picking her 
dress with their claws as though to 
arouse her from slumber while they 
looked up in the faces of the bystand 
ers with an expression of brute an 
guish more painful to see than the 
deepest agony of a human counte 
nance for the human countenance

can only look and mourn

old lady knew them nappy the 
black cat with snake-like eyes and 
washy the lubberly white cat with a 
sleepy look all walked round the dead 
body staining their feet in the thick 
blood while with moan after moan 
they picked the torn dress of the old 
woman with their claws and seemed 
urging her to rise 

 genelmen aint that a sight for

beside the corpse with his head droop

health let but a drop from this phial 
uas his lips and his face will take 
the hue of ashes his heart grow cold 
and lifeless the world ha ha ha 
the world will wonder and stare and 
the doctor nodding sagely all the 
while will aver by all the knowledge 
of his craft that livingstone came to 
his death through the natural result 
of the fatal disease which has been 
gathering round his heart for years 

 i alone will hold the mystery of 
his death locked fast among the se 
crets of my bosom 

dora livingstone was alone alone 
in that gorgeous chamber which li 
vingstone had delighted to crowd with 
the evidences of his wealth situated 

r m a central part of his mansion it 
was illumined by a splendid chan 
delier whose price told in round 
heaps of dollars would have bought 
you a seat in congress or wrung 

justice from the most impartial bench 
the light of the chandelier sub 
dued and softened by thick shades of 
costly glass fell around the chamber 
with the effect of moonlight disclosing 
rhe satin hangings which concealed 
the lofty walls the gorgeous carpet 
laid along the floor and the splendid 
furniture which gave an appearance 
of extreme luxury to the place 
the wide hearth surmounted by a 
mantel adorned with vases of ala 
baster was enlivened by the glow of 
a cheerful wood-fire whose gleams 
now shot flashingly along the room 
and now died away into a steady and 
cheerful blaze all around the walls 
among the hangings of crimson satin 
oictures in gorgeous frames received 
rhe glow of the chandelier full on their 



canvass every inch of which had 
been made immortal by the hand of 
one of the painter-genii of the old 
world venus rising from the bath 
fresh in the lustre of her charms 
apollo erect in the glory of youthful 
manhood daphne awaiting the ap 
proach of the god eve bending over 
the fountain in whose clear waves 
she saw another eve radiant as her 
self such were a few of the figures 
beaming from the pictures hung along 
the walls with the rich folds of the 
satin hangings falling carelessly aside 
from their heavy frames 

the chamber we say was crowd 
ed with evidences of livingstone s 
wealth on the centre-table of rich 
mosaic were caskets of ebony glitter 
ing with the jewels of dora the mer 
chant s wife rajejuriosities prized 
and costly from their very variety 
vases of alabaster antique gems 
rich with the fairy-sculpture of some 
classic artist and all the costly spoils 
which gold that conqueror and dis- 
poiler of art more unrelenting than 
the goth or corsican had won from 
the galleries and cabinets of rome and 
florence the carpet whose gor 
geous hues overspread the floor con 
sidered by itself alone was worth the 
price of a first rate statesman as j 
statesmen are valued in the political 
market while the elegant sofa and 
the chairs elaborate with gothic 
work and embroidery turned into 
gold would have bought up a dozen 
patriots of the common order alto 
gether the room was full of wealth 
luxury and splendor and here it 
was that dora uncompanioned savo 
by her own dark thoughts had retired

to arrange her plans and hasten on 
the fatal crime on whose result she 
nad perilled her soul 

bu in hour returned from the 
theatre where she had shone among 
the magnates of the quaker city no 
bility she had thrown aside her costly 
robes and assumed a garb whose 
loose folds gathering gently around 
her queenly form displayed her 
beauty to more advantage than all 
the silks of france or costumes of an 
imperial court 

seated in that article of furniture 
peculiarly american a rocking chair 
with her head thrown back her eyes 
upturned with their lids half-closed 
while her dark tresses released from 
comb or braid fell carelessly over 
her shoulders the lady was enrobed 
in a gown of faint azure satin whose 
ample development of shape or 
want of shape wide sleeves and 
swelling folds gathered round her 
bust and waist and limbs with a 
voluptuous adaptation to every out 
line of her faultless form 

her arms were crossed carelessly 
over her bosom while the softened 
light of the chandelier fell warmly 
over the whiteness of her small hands 
and rounded shoulders snowy and 
roseate as alabaster tinged by the 
flush of daybreak her feet in all 
their delicate outlines unconfined by 
slipper or stocking peeped from the 
heavy folds of her night-robe white 
as parian marble and quite as beau- 
tifu in their proportions as these from 
which canova modelled the feet of 
his venus 

certainly a beautiful woman is the 
greatest wonder of god s universe 
certainty the remarkable combination 



of beauties presented by her form 
the outlines rounded and flowing 
whether manifested in the fulness of 
the bust or the faultless symmetry of 
the limbs the various hues which are 
combined in her person the deep 
black of her hair the soft rose tint of 
her cheek and lips the alabaster of 
her hands and neck and shoulders 
the lustrous darkness of her eye and 
the blackness of her brows and 
lashes the magic of her walk each 
limb moving in as much harmony 
with the general effect as the star 
circling in its orbit compares in the 
regularity of its motion with star 
certainty we say these beauties and 
graces afford more convincing proof 
of god s power than the whole uni 
verse combined 

but then when we add to these the 
attractions of her soul that strange 
magnetism of her look which en 
chains and fascinates that varied in 
tonation of voice which can awe us 
in a whisper or bring us to ruin with 
a word that power to flatter to glose 
a falsehood and cover the naked 
blackness of a lie with such a delicate 
surface of ivoried -fiction when we 
remember that by the pressure of her 
hand slight warm and thrilling she 
can lure the preacher from his pul 
pit the statesman from his solemn 
thoughts the grave justice from his 
bench itjbecpmes a wonder why that 
most wonderful of all things a beauti 
ful woman was ever permitted by the 
creator to have the power of evi 
entrusted to her nature 

here we have dora livingstone 
sitting in yonder rocking chair by the 
light of that splendid chandelier as

beautiful as god s own light and yet 
in her heart as corrupt as the black 
ness of hell is she not beautiful 
mark the head thrown backward 
the soft flush warming over her face 
the half-closed lids the parted lips 
so rich so small and yet so full and 
ripe in their redness and shape mark 
the glossy blackness of her hair 
sweeping down in careless clusters to 
her shoulders and those very shoul 
ders how round their outline how 
soft their surface how bewitching 
that dimple indenting itself like a 
living smile into the centre of each 
shoulder just where the full arms are 
joined to the queenly bust ah-ha 
the bust how it heaves beneath 
the careless folds of the satin gown 
slowly slowly higher and yet higher 
like a wave hidden by a snow-flake 

the hands lightly crossed over that 
bosom the tapering fingers the dim 
ples along the surface of the white 
skin where the fingers join the hand 
itself the clear nails tinged with a 
circle of deep red around their edges 
that glimpse of a wrist and an arm 



disclosed by the wide 
falls carelessly aside 



sleeve as it 
the slender 



waist its shape revealed by the volup 
tuous a good word for any thing that 
is easy in position swelling in outline 
bewitching in general effect folds 
of the satin robe the full pro 
portions of the lower part of her form 
suggest mingled ideas of stateliness 
ripeness and beauty pleasant images 
of white swans smiling grandly 
waters ripe peaches 



over smooth 
heavy from 



their 



very ripeness 



hanging lusciously from some bend 
ing bough or soft daybreaks or 
lovely sunsets or still midnights or 



indeed any thing whose beauty a 
without comparison 

and then the feet ha ha we 
have come down to the feet and these 
let me tell you are not the most con 
temptible of dora s beauties the 
high instep do smile at our minute 
ness the long and narrow form the 
shape of the toes the nails like the 
fingers tinged each of them with a 
deep circlet of red 

a look at the face again do not 
those red lips with glimpses of the 
ivory teeth stealing out upon you 
from the interval of the moist vermi 
lion do they not look as though they 
were but made for a man to kiss once 
and then die the eye gleamin jt 
between the half-closed lids beaming 
from the shadow of the long anltr 
trembling lashes how beautiful they 
are as veiled in a lustrous moisture 
a mist-like dimness they indicate the 
soul absorbed in a reverie the 
broad forehead a thing we do no 
always like to see in woman the dark 
eyebrows the regularly shaped nose 
grecian with the slightest inclination 
toward the aquiline the firm round 
chin ha ha 

here s a beautiful woman sitting 
easily in the rocking-chair as a good 
wife who has not a single bad thought 
should sit and yet this beautiful wo 
man is already in heart a murderess 

already false to the honor of her 
husband she now would assail his 
life and she so beautiful so queenly 
and so like the impersonation of a pure 
thought in every outline of her form 
and this was once a confiding loving 
and boasting girl but the canker of 
ambition has warmed itself into her 
soul the atmosphere of sensuality has 



dora and luke 



 






changed her inner nature while her 
outward beauties remain the same 
alas alas why did not eve stay 
at home in the garden of eden and 
refrain from wandering about she 
knew not whither and plucking for 
bidden fruit and listening to handsome 
serpents ever since that fatal hour 
too many of her fair daughters have 
not only plucked but turned them 
selves into forbidden fruit not only 
listened to handsome serpents but 
 transformed themselves into very 
 snakes whose venom of sting is but 
 ill-recompensed by their glittering and 
brilliant exterior 

 no mark of violence no sign of 
murder to tell the story of an untimely 
death the thought flashed over the 
mind of the wife but did not shape 
itself into words the world will 
say he died of that fatal disease 
which threatened him for years 



claimed looking at her watch you 
may bring in the coffee thomas 

 coffee for you and mr living 
stone yes ma am 

mrs livingstone was alone again 
raising her form languidly from the 
half-reclining position in which she 
had lain dora lifted her right hand 
slowly to her very eyes and gazed 
intently upon a small phial clasped 
between her delicate fingers the 
phial not larger than the most delicate 
finger on her snowy hand was filled 
with a liquid clear as crystal which 
sparkled like a star within the glas 
as she raised it in the light wrap 
ping her spotless handkerchief care 
fully around it as ladies are wont to 
do with their smelling bottles dora 
again relapsed into her half-reclining 
position on the back of the rocking 
chair 

 a drop fresh from the phiai 
mingled with any liquid is sure to kill 



dora of lyndeswold ha ha alger- but it must be applied the moment 



non thinks he can mould me to his 
slightest purpose what is the block 
of marble should seize the chissel 
and change places with the sculptor 

extending her hand she lifted the 
small bell from the white cloth of the 
table at her side a moment and the 
silvery sound of the bell rung round 
the room 

the servant in livery presented 
himself at the door 

 did you ring ma am 

 what time did mr livingstone 
say he would return home exclaim 
ed dora without turning her eyes in 
the direction of the door which was 
behind the back of her chair

entering with two porcelain cups 
smoking with coffee which he placeo

mabel 



this done thomas who looked as 
though he had been born in his grey 
and velvet livery with but the power of 
saying yes ma am no ma am retired 
from the room in the same formal man 
ner which had marked his entrance 
dora relapsed into her reverie 
again a footstep sounded in the en 
try leading to the chamber her 
frame quivered with a slight start 
but in an instant she sank into the 
lthair again with her head thrown 
backward on the soft velvet cushion 
ing another moment and the foot 
step grew nearer 

 it is he she muttered and 
with an effort maintained her care 
less half-slumbering attitude as 
she spoke the door opened and she 
heard the pressure of the footstep 
upon the carpet 

my dear you have been absent 
very long said dora languidly 
without moving from her position 

a slight yet deep-toned laugh 
echoing behind her chair was the 
only answer she received from the 
new-comer 

 ha i should know that laugh 
she cried starting luke harvey 
she murmured as she beheld the form 
of the stranger luke harvey and 
at this hour that man is my evil 
fate 

 excuse this intrusion madam 
exclaimed luke advancing with a 
slight bow mr livingstone made 
an appointment to meet me at this 
hour he is not in t preceive 

 mr livingstone is not at home 

exclaimed dora rising even in her 

drshabille with an air of freezing po- 

iteness 

oh well well replied luke 



ixing his dark eyes upon her beaut 
ul face well well it makes do 
lifference i m one of that class who 
can either wait or be put off 

and as he spoke with the coolest 
manner in the world he drew a chair 
and sate down on the opposite side of 
he table dora gazed upon him in 
utter surprise with one hand she 
seized her dark tresses and bound 
hem up within her comb while with 
an instinctive movement she with 
drew her naked feet under the shadow 
of her satin night-robe 

 ha cried luke sleepily with 
a slight yawn as he drummed on his 
bat with his fingers ha hum 
cool evening ma am 

 sir exclaimed dora as her 
roud form towered proudly erect 
 this is my private chamber you 
an wait for mr livingstone in the 
hall down stairs 

she fixed her dark eyes upon him 
as though she would wither him with 
a look 

 sir echoed luke with that 
sneering laugh which sometimes gave 
his sharp features the expression of a 
sneering devil sir to me ha 
ha dora too good that ir 
ha ha ha 

 dora echoed the merchant s 
wife in a tone of utter astonishment 
as though she had not heard aright 
 dora indeed you are eithei 
mad or impertinent sir 

 sit down dora sit down and 
compose yourself replied luke 
still drumming on the crown of his 
hat doesn t it strike you as ex 
tremely odd dora that you should 
assume that freezing look and call me 
sir d ye remember the little back

tion brightened over her face while 
her dark eyes flashed fire leave

indignation

indeed ha ha ha 

ltc mr livingstone shall be inform 
ed of this insult said dora in a 
deep low tone that indicated the most 
deadly anger she rang the bell vio- 
ently as she spoke 

 i presume you are about to order 
your servants to thrust me from your 
doors said luke his voice sinking 
to a whisper as he leaned over the 
table and awaited her answer 



she made no reply but sinking in 
the chair turned her face away from 
her former lover and with a gesture 
of fierce anger rang the bell as though 
her life depended on its clamor 

 thrust me from the doors dear 
luke you said and kissed me 
luke bent slowly down gazing at the 
indignant woman through the shadow 
of his thick eyebrows as he spoke 
 do you know dora that i often 
think of that little back parlor in 
wood street a splendid woman on 
my knee her full arms around my 
neck her soft whispers falling on my 
ears like delightful music when 
we are married luke twas thus 
you often whispered we ll live to 
gether in some nice two-story house 
secluded from the world your sa 
lary is small luke and we may be 
very poor but and then you would 
smile dora we have that which the 
wealth of the indies cannot give love 
luke love then you would 
kiss me when i shut my eyes and 
forgot the present i can feel thoso 
kisses still clinging to my lips

ed of this insult sir exclaimed dora 
her brow darkening with rage as with 
her back turned toward liike she 
clenched her hands in very anger

stone of my conduct whispered 
luke leaning over the table as his 
band was thrust within his bosom 
have me thrust from your doors

duct but but his voice sunk to a 
vhisper like the hissing of a snake 
at the same time inform him of the 
contents of this note 



 



mae el 



leaning over the table he held a 
letter which he had taken from his 
bosom open to her gaze 

 what folly is this began dora 
as she glanced over her shoulder at 
the letter which luke held extended 
in his hand ah she shrieked 
in utter horror as with a lightning 
glance she caught a view of the su 
perscription ltmy letter to fitz- 
cowles gt oh god i am in this man s 
power 

she buried her face in her hands 
while her hair escaping from the 
cornb fall wildly over her neck and 
bosom 

 how interesting you look just 
now good night dear luke v 
will you inform mr livingstone of 
this insult will you order the servant 
to thrust me from the door 

 did you ring ma am exclaim 
ed thomas opening the door 

dora started from her seat and ad 
vanced hurriedly toward the fireplace 
her brow was darkened by a fearful 
frown and a bigblack vein marred 
the beauty of her forehead 

 i am in his power she mutter 
ed to herself he can by a single 
word scatter all my schemes to the 
wind and cover me with shame 
what endure the foul tongue of pub 
lic slander never ha this man 
must die i have resolved upon my 
course she turned to the servant 
and exclaimed in her usual command 
ing tones mr harvey will take 
coffee with me to-night the coffee 
which you have placed upon the table 
s cold bring in fresh coffee 
thomas 

with a wild stare of amazement 
as though he suspected all was not 



right thomas closed the door ana 
disappeared 

you are a bold and desperate 
man cried dora as she advanced 
toward the table and gazed fixed y 
in luke s face i am in your 
power what would you with me 

i thought that would bring you 
down a peg or so exclaimed luke 
smiling as he rattled the letter against 
the table however here s the 
coffee he continued as thomas en 
tered like a spirit placed fresh cups 
of coffee on the table and in an in 
stant was gone here s the coffee 
take a cup with me dora d ye 
remember those nice little suppers ir 
the back parlor in wood street 

 do me the favor sir to arrange 
the fire on the hearth exclaimed 
dora in a tone as commanding as 
though she spoke to the humblest of 
her menials the room is quite 
cold m 

luke smiled pleasantly as a man 
is wont to smile who indulges a child 
in some trifling humor and then turn 
ing toward the fireplace commenced 
arranging the huge sticks of wood 
upon the hearth 

a wild light flashed from dora s 
dark eyes bending slightly forward 
she held her right hand over one of 
the porcelain cups and taking the 
cork from the small phial she suffered 
a single drop to mingle with the fra 
grant coffee it was the work of a 
moment when luke turned again 
from the fireplace she was seated in 
the rocking chair her head thrown 
back as with her right hand upraised 
she made a show of applying salts to 
her nostrils 

 good coffee this said luke as 



luke and dora 



he seated himself by the table take 
a cup madam i 

dora silently raised the cup which 
was untinctured with the contents of 
ihe phial as she lifted it to her lips 
she silently watched luke s move 
ments over the edge of the cup 

 good coffee he exclaimed has 
a pleasant fragrance he raised it 
to his lips 

a slight start quivered through 
dora s frame he drinks the 
thought flashed over her soul he 
drinks he is lost in a moment 
he will fall from the chair a lifeless 
corse 

 good coffee i say exclaimed 
luke gazing quietly at dora over 
the edge of the uplifted cup has 
a surprising fragrance but he hesi 
tated slightly lowering the cup from 
his lips but dora and a smile 
of strange meaning crossed his lips 

what mean you sir she ex 
claimed sipping her coffee with a 
careless air while her heart swelled 
to bursting and her inmost soul was 
thrilled with the appaling interest of 
the scene what mean you sir 

 fragrant coffee but i prefer 
cogniac to mocha said luke quietly 
placing the porcelain cup on the table 
without tasting its contents ha 
ha i can make the same remark to 
you that the convict made to the 
hangman who did his business in 
such a bungling manner that the 
poor fellow with his neck in the rope 
roared out a forcible reproof i say 
you wasn t quick enough with the 
drop ha ha pooh you can t 
poison me dora i m not one of 
them kind 

dora could feel her heart grow cold 



in her bosom for a single instant 
she felt as though she was about to 
fall dead on the floor she had but 
presence of mind to conceal the small 
phial in the handkerchief and place 
it within the folds of her dress when 
her very reason seemed to fail her 
and pressing her hands against her 
burning forehead a single exclama 
tion escaped from her lips 
all is lost 

 suppose i show the letter to your 
husband said luke with a quiet 
sneer as he stood surveying her 
agony with a silent delight 

her bosom rose heaving from the 
folds of her dress as though convuls 
ed by the agony of death still her 
hands were pressed against her brow 
while her large black eyes dilating 
with a wild stare glared fixedly in 
the face of her torturer 

to-morrow to-morrow the 
bought came darkening over her soul 
 i will be the scoff and jeer of all 
he fashionable circles my name a 
by-word my reputation a bauble 
and more than all more than the 
scoff of the world more than my 
husband s hate my plans will all be 
scattered in ruins no no i will 
ry my last hope with this man he 
oved me once and how the 
bought of the degradation galls me 
now i must kneel to him for mercy 
zwfce she shrieked aloud as 
she rose on her feet and stood before 
him a breathing picture of mortal 
agony her hands convulsively clasp 
ed while her long dark hair fell 
glistening over her shoulders luke 
 that sounds better than sir - 
replied luke in the same dry and 
biting tone

spare me luke she shriekec 
flinging herself on her knees at his 
feet spare me luke 

ha ha the beauty of the 
quaker city at my feet i 

he said this with his usual dry anc 
caustic laugh but the spectacle began 
to touch the chords of his dark and 
mysterious nature 

her dark hair showering over her 
shoulders the loose robe floating wild 
ly around her voluptuous form her 
womanly bosom rising into view her 
hands clasped and her eyes glaring 
with a vacant stare she shrieked forth 
m a voice whose agony of emphasis 
no words can depict by the me 
mory of the love you once felt for 
me oh spare me mercy luke in 
god s name mercy 

 that love which wound your 
image round my heart as never man s 
love entwined the image of mortal wo 
man before that love you trampled 
upon and his snake-like eye gleam 
ed with a savage light had you been 
but a bosom friend and stolen my 
money i would have forgiven you 
had you been my wife and left me 
for dishonor i might still have for 
given you but girl that you were 
you trampled upon a heart that would 
have bled its last drop for you you 
trifled with a soul that would have 
dared eternal ruin for your sake 
spare you never 

the cool and biting tone in which 
he spoke restored dora to full con 
sciousness and reason she saw that 
her very soul hung in a fearful ba 
lance and by one quick operation of 
her genius she resolved to fling the 
we ght of hor charms into the scale 

 luke she cried spreading her 



arms toward him as she knelt at his 
feet while her eyes swimming with 
well-affected passion were fixed upon 
his countenance you once loved 
me luke you will spare me now 

as if by accident she suffered the 
folds of her night-gown to slip aside 
and her white shoulder with all its 
faultless symmetry of shape lay open 
to the beams of the light 

luke gazed upon her and felt his 
heart relent she knelt before him 
an embodied tempest of voluptuous 
oveliness her cheeks flushed in 
ively hues her eyes beaming passion 
ier long dark hair streaming down to 
ier uncovered shoulders glimpses of 
her bosom whose womanly fullness 
now grew animate with voluptuous 
agitation rising slowly in the light 
luke gazed upon her and thought of 
he olden time 

mercy luke mercy 

 on one condition he exclaimed 
n a whisper that thrilled to her very 
leart 

and that is 

he hissed a single word in her ear 
as his dark eyes drank in the living 
icture of her beanty 

she started as though an adder had 
stung her 

 never she shrieked with a 

lance of unfeigned indignation 

sooner will i face the very worst 

the world s scorn and my husband s 

late 

she had prepared herself to use al 
he influence of her charms to win 
mercy from his iron heart but-to 
ell herself for the letter thfc 
hought aroused all that pride which 
lad been the first cause of her ruin 

 this letter published the worw

will call you an adultress a 
pretty word dora 

she quivered in every limb as the 
foul word broke on her ears drop 
ping her head upon her bosom she 
jasped his knees with her trembling 
hands the cup of her degradation 
was full 

t i consent she murmured 
 da-with me what you will 

 the letter is yours dora he 
jaid in a husky voice you place 
yourself in my power 

 i have sold myself to you her 
voice sunk to a whisper almost 
inaudible the price this witness of 
my guilt 

luke gathered his arms around her 
form as she knelt before him and 
bending her head slightly backward 
gazed upon her face her eyes were 
dimcast and a deep crimson flush 
mantled over her face she lay in 
his arms motionless as a statue yet 
living as a flame luke slowly raised 
her from the floor her head drooped 
on his shoulder and her bosom throb 
bed warmly against his breast for 
a single moment the light of passion 
subdued the cold and snake-like gleam 
of his eyes but even in that instant 
the face of the fair and unknown girl 
whom he had seen that morning for 
the first time in his life rose like a 
guardian angel before him and with 
that vision a frown darkened over his 
forehead and an expression of scorn 
trembled on his lip 

 you place yourself in my power 
dora ha ha here s beauty for j 
the sight and touch here s soft 
glances of the eyes kisses of the lip 
pressures of the moist hand all for j 



sale and i i with the most beau- 
tiful woman in the quaker city in 

my arms waiting to become mine 

i with this living picture of health 
loveliness and passion in my arms 
proffering her lip to my kiss her bo 
som to my touch have still the 

moral self denial ha ha ha to 

scorn the embraces of an 

adultress 

with that mocking laugh he flung 
her rudely from him and rushed from 
the room 

extending her arms with a faint 
effort to preserve her balance she fell 
insensible to the floor 

god save from the vengeance of 
this woman the man who dared to 
put such galling scorn upon her 
there she lay all her pride and beau 
ty brought down to the dust there she 
lay her cheeks pale as death her lips 
parted and her eyes glaring upon the 
ceiling with an unconscious stare 
there she lay insensible and motion 
less buthe fiend was locked within 
that faultless form within the snowy 
whiteness of that bosom now gleam 
ing coldly in the light was hell

before to-morrow night or my name

know more about her too before i m 
many hours older 

attired in the rags of brick-top 
with the red hair falling over his eyes 
and his face all smeared with paint 
and invested with huge crimson 
whiskers luke was hurrying down 
third street his hands in his pockets 
and his body thrown forward while 
 his walk was that of a genuine loafer 
being made up of an indian s tramp 
when on a war-path and a high 
lander s characteristic trot a sort of 
half-walk and half-run with a slight 
sprinkling of a lazy lounge 

to say that luke did not relish 
these excursions for the adventure s 
sake alone would be doing him rank 
injustice he found as much pleasure 
in pursuing the thread of a difficult 
enterprize which combined danger 
romance and mystery as the most 
indefatigable novel-reader finds in the 



pages of a book like rookwood 
where the attention is from first to 
last rivetted and enchained by one 
passage of breathless interest succeed 
ing another in transitions as rapid 
and thrilling as the changes of some 
well -contested battle 

 here s a new mystery mut 
tered luke as he struck into a bye- 
street mary arlington missing and 
her brother in the bargain egad 
this will be an eventful christmas if 



 the author begs leave to record his 
humble admiration of wm harrison ains- 
worth whom all the starch-and-buckram 
critics have been abusing so heartily for years 
rookwood is a production of which walter 
scott might have been proud ainsworth 
understands the art and theory of the plot of 
a story better than any living writer 

among other remarkable things uttered 
by an industrious compiler named griswold 
who with singular modesty has taken upon 
himself to say who are and who are not the 
poets of america the following passage ia 
one of the most remarkable mr codjgter is 
less read in the united states tlian itarrisor 
ainsworth passing over the solemn joke 
of mistering the greatest novelist that 
ever gave a literary name to our country 
abroad or enchained his million-readers at 
home we come to the implied sneer on the 
genius of ainsworth for though it s a very 
dull attempt at sarcasm still the intelligent 
griswold with that commendable effort 
which marks all his compilations meant to 
be very bitter by insinuating this comparison 
between the two men in the first place the 
fact about cooper being less read than ains 
worth is a compiler sfact about as substan 
tial sometimes as his title of reverend or 
his claims to the acumen of a critic or tha 
power of a genius in the next place we 
humbly opine that works like rookwood 
and crichton are not to be killed with a 
sneer although that sneer comes from the 
same pen that with its twin-scissors has 
compiled a small library of poetry 
 annuals curiosities sermons 
cock robins illustrated and jack 
the giant killers in cloth with notes

things keep on this way however 
my business to night is to follow in 
the footsteps of the illustrious parson 
pyne in the first place i must 
make for his lecture room 

passing from the bye-street into a 
dark alley where the winter wind 
was doing a fierce concert on its own 
account while the clear cold stars 
shone down between the intervals of 
the roofs that almost met overhead 
luke presently halted under the light 
of a lamp which projected from the 
wall of an old brick building illumi 
nated the dingy confines of an entry 
disclosed by an open door above 
the door a large sign bore the legend 
in bright yellow letters painted on a 
dark ground

 brethern and sisters i ask you 
a plain question and i want a plain 
answer we have assembled on a 
most interesting occasion i might say 
a sublime occasion to which all other 
occasions are but a mole-hill to the 
mighty andes or a gin-shop to the 
palace of nebuchadnezzar we have 
met together to forward the objects of 
our grand association which as you 



all know is called the universal 
patent gospel missionary society for 
the conversion of the pope of rome 
in particular and the suppression 
of vatican paganism in general 
we are a-going to send the gospel to 
benighted rome trembling in his 
pontificial robes with a bull in one 
hand and a cup o coffee in the other 
the mighty anti-christ shall start in 
his vatican when he hears our thun 
der a-booming over the fragrant plains 
of idolatrous italy he shall hear our 
thunder and while his knees tremble 
and his eyes water he shall ask his 
four-and- enty cardinals as they 
sit revelling in oysters and wine 
 boys what s that and they shall 
answer turning white from very fear 
that s the american patent gos 
pel pope that s the roaring of a 
real buffalo a-seekin to fight your 
bull and then the pope shall ask 
what is the american patent gospel 
as he speaks our answer shall thun 
der in his ears our gospel is a 
patent improved gospel a terrifier 
a scorcher a real locomotive-off-the- - f 
track sort of a gospel we hold it 
to be a comfortable doctrine to abuse 
the pope o rome afore breakfast and 
after breakfast and all day long 

we hold it to be a consoling belief 
that of all the millions o human be 
n s ever created by the lord three- 
fourths of them are roasting in the 
broad lake o fire and brimstone this 
very minnit our gospel is a gos 
pel of fire and brimstone and abuse 
o the pope o rome mingled in 
qual quantities about half o one 
and half o tother that s what cur

standing on his small pulpit which 



 



mabel 



looked something like a cross between 
a watch-box and a bath-tub the 
reverend mr pyne extending his 
arms with his coat thrown back and 
nis portly paunch thrust forward his 
broad face red as a turkey s gills v 
and his watery eyes starting from 
their sockets thundered forth the 
solemn assertion yet once more 
 fire and brimstone in the morning 
abuse o the pope o rome at night 
brimstone and fire at night abuse 
o the pope o rome in the morning 
turn it and twist it as you will that s 
what our gospel is 

one universal sensation spread 
through the lecture room like wild 
fire the old women sitting on the 
first benches in big black bonnets and 
long faces groaned positively groan 
ed the old gentlemen sitting behind 
the old ladies stuck their hands far 
down in their pockets and groaned in 
chorus while all the young men in 
white cravats and all the young la 
dies in straw bonnets with flashing 
ribbons vented their enthusiasm in a 
simultaneous cough 

the lecture room of the true be 
lievers and true repenters was a 
long and narrow apartment with a 
dingy white ceiling from which de 
pended a rusty chandelier and smoky 
walls lone cheerless and desolate in 
its appearance with here and there a 
great spot of indefinable black look 
ing as though the plaster had received 
a bruise and immense cracks run 
ning from ceiling to floor like veins 
in the lithograph of a coal mine at 
one end of this large room was the 
pulpit looking as we have said like 
a composition of a watch-box and a 
bath-tub at the other end was the 



narrow door and between the dooi 
and the pulpit were seated one dense 
mass of human beings male and fe 
male old and young high and low 
rich and poor packed together along 
uncomfortable benches of unpainted 
pine like sardines in a tin-box back 
of the pulpit on a green settee were 
gathered some dozen gentlemen in 
white cravats and sanctified faces 
their hands clasped on their crossed 
knees as bending earnestly forward 
they listened in painful intensity to the 
words of elder pyne immediately 
in front of the pulpit around a large 
table covered withjaeen baize in the 
centre of which was an inkstand a 
sheet of paper and two quills freshly 
mended some dozen more brothers 
were seated on green chairs their 
heads thrown backward and theii 
mouths wide open as they all listened 
to the words of the pious brother 
pyne with an acute earnestness quite 
remarkable to behold 

 thafs what our gospel is con- 
tinued f a t pyne with a final 
flourish tho various committees 
appointed at the last meeting of our 
association will now re-port 

one of the gentlemen sitting at tlit 
back of the rev pyne now arose and 
came to the edge of the bath-tub with 
a great roll of paper in his hand he 
was a short little man with a long 
face thin lips and thick eyebrows 
which well-nigh concealed his dimi 
nutive eyes 

 brother augustus billygoat from 
the committee on the pope o 
rome observed the rev pyne in 
a suggestive tone to the assemblage 

 the com-mittee on the pope o 
rome do re-port began brother 



the free believers and true repenters 



 



billygoat in a voice somewhat afflic 
ted by a cold that they have ex 
amined into the pope o rome and 
j weighed him in the balances o th 
patent gospel and he is founc 
antin as toilers 

a great sensation one old woman 
exclaimed tremendous in a tone 
somewhat too loud whereupon a bro 
ther sitting on the next seat pinched 
her lovingly in the arm 

he is found a wantin whereas he 
sends out bulls and the scriptur don t 
tolerate any bulls he s found a 
wantin because he lives in a sump 
tuous palace called -the wattykin 
vve defies the whole world to find the 
name o th wattykin in the bible 
friends and brethren we of this com 
mittee think the day will come and 
is not long a comin when the pope o 
rome like nebbykudneezir will have 
to go to grass and chaw roots for his 
livvin the watty-kin will be deso 
late the owl will hoot through its 
walls and the rooster crow from its 
towers 

 with these few brief remarks i 
lays the report on the table without 
readin it in full makin a motion at 
the same time that it shall be printed 
in the universal american patent- 
gospel exposition for the instruction o 
futur ages 

the motion was carried by accla 
mation brother billygoat sat down 
amid a murmur of applause 

another brother rose he was a 
man of the middle height with a look 
of deep sanctity oozing from the 
parchment of his saffron skin his 
eyes were as is often the case with 
persons of remarkable piety inclined 

to be watery and dump-ish his voice 
 






was a low-toned persuading kind of 
voice slightly tinctured with a snuffle 
his hands were placed behind his 
back as he spoke while his long lank 
hair fell carelessly around his cheeks 
and over his ears 

it gave him great pleasure he re 
marked to behold this demonstration 
with that he pointed emphatically at 
the front bench filled with old ladies 
in large black bonnets such things 
as this were calculated to expand the 
feelings while they confirmed the re 
ligious sentiment as the editor of 
the patent- gospel expositor he felt 
proud as a christian he felt de 
lighted as a protestant of the uni 
versal american patent-gospel school 
he felt enraptured he too considered 
it his duty to testify to the abuses of 
papal rome old babylon ought to 
be exposed laid out and cut up 
those were his sentiments in order 
to carry them fully into action he 
would relate a painful incident 

the captain of an american brig 
which made a voyage to naples one 
summer s day suggested to his crew 
and passengers that it would be a 
capital idea to visit the old pagan in 
his vatican the crew the passen 
gers consented 

they went to rome continued 
the rev syllaybub scissors as the 
editor of the patent- gospel was 
styled they saw the old pagan 
there were ten men of the crew 
and twenty passengers not counting 
a little boy they all had tracts 
from the patent-gospellers association 
in their pockets the pope sat in his 
chair with a large number of car 
dinals in attendance it may be aa 
well to remark that the old pagan 






 



mabel 



keeps these cardinals as gentlemen in 
waiting to bring him coffee and muf 
fins or perhaps oysters well the 
crew and passengers all dressed in 
their best took a view of old anti- 
christ but mark ye brethren and 
sisters they are called upon to kiss 
the pope s toe like americans like 
patent-gospellers they refused they 
refused the ten men of the crew the 
twenty passengers and the little boy 
what was the consequence of the re 
fusal what i say was the con 
sequence 

there was utter silence in the hall 
of the free believers and true re- 
penters you might have heard a 
pin drop 

why brethren and sisters i ll 
tell you cried syllaybub scissors 
growing very much excited those 
passengers crew captain little boy 
and ttzz have never been heard of 
since great sensation they 
went into the vatican it is true but 
they never came out again tre 
mendous excitement i have nothing 
further to remark my friends but 
will close with a painful fact it is 
melancholy but it is too true that next 
door to the vatican is a large manu 
factory for bologna sausages the 
excitement becomes intense some 
time after this painful disappearance 
an american gentleman travelling 
through italy for his health saw fit to 
order a large amount of sausages from 
this very factory well the sausages 
were sent home the american gen- 
deman ordered one of them to be cut 
a slight obstruction opposed the pas- 
age of the knife it was a small 
iump of something wrapped up pretty 
tight the american gentleman with 



his own ringers picked the small lump 
o something from the very centre of 
the sausage it was a piece of paper 
he unrolled it brothers and sisters 
it was nothing more than a fragment 
of a tract issued by the patent-gos 
pellers and headed a thrust at 
pagan rome brothers and sisters 
each one of that lot of sausages en 
being opened contained one or more 
of such fragments brothers and sis- 
ters those ten men of the crew those 
twenty passengers that captain and 
that little boy all had patent-gospel 
tracts in their pockets when they 
were missed brothers and sisters i 
will leave you to draw your own con 
clusions 

the rev syllaybub scissors sate 
down amid a perfect hurricane of ap 
plause what the free believers 
applauded it was difficult to tell 
whether it was the pope of rome 
or the crew or the passengers or the 
little boy or the sausage manufactory 
or whether it was the american gen 
tleman so mysteriously held in view 
to this day remains a mystery 

 missionaries stand forth cried 
the reverend f a t pyne rising 
statelily behind his bath-tub 

three young men with long hair 
very tow-like in hue stuck behind 
their ears and white cravats around 
their necks stepped slowly forward 
and took their place in front of the 
pulpit crossing their hands very 
meekly on their breast and casting 
their eyes upon a particular nail in 
the floor with a sanctity of look thai 
was quite edifying even to an uncon 
verted man 

 abel stump joshua hoe benijah 
baker are you willing to go abroad 



the free believers and true repenters 



 



lo the pope of rome as missionaries 
sent by the universal american pa 
tent-gospel association exclaimed 
brother pyne in a loud voice with his 
fist raised in the air in a gesture of 
indignant menace 

 we air responded three faint 
and sickly voices 

 do you understand your calling 
continued brother pyne in his most 
boanergian voice you are to allow 
the pagan no peace you are to give 
him tracts as he comes from mass 
you are to present him with a fresh 
bible every sabbath you are to hail 
him in the street and tell him that in 
america the patent-gospellers are 
raising a buffalo to fight his bull 
are you willing to defy the inquisition 
in such a cause are you willing to 
defy death are you willing to be 
made up in sausages in such a cause 
are you brothers i say 

 we air responded the three 
faint and sickly voices 

 here is a sight for the whole 
world to see continued the reverend 
f a t pyne his eyes dilating while 
his crimson face looked like the full 
moon seen through a distempered 
mist here standing upon the rock 
of freedom we tell the pope of rome 
that his schemes are defeated that his 
babylon has fallen ha ha we 
laugh at the pope of rome we tell 
him in tones of indignant thunder that 
his grand plan of buying up the state 
of missouri in order to erect a papal 
kingdom on american soil and let 
his bulls loose to run wild on ameri 
can prairies has fell through been 
nullified and trampled upon with the 
ponderous foot of the universal patent- 
association he would build 



a vatican on the banks of the mis 
sissippi would he he d have his 
propaganda in the state house would 
he yes yes he would have his 
college of cardinals in faneuil hall 
would he he would but he can t 
we snap our fingers at him ha ha 
let him jump jim crow in his vatican 
at rome if he likes but he rrms n t try 
to build another st peter s on our soil 
no no no down with the pope 
say i down with the pope say all 
we ll fight his bulls with spiritual 
weapons with the patent-gospel bowie 
knife we ll crowd our pulpits with 
lecturers no matter who they are 
or what they are or where they come 
from from the prison we welcome 
them from the jail or the galleys 
or even from the rope of the gibbet 
still still we welcome them are 
they not brothers co-workers with 
us let them but affirm that they 
once were priests of rome let them 
but declare they are converted jesuits 
and with all our hearts we welcome 
them but they must decry rome 
down with rome down with the j 
pope up with the bible 

they must rake up from the 
ashes of the past all the firebrands 
ever lighted in the flames of hell 
all the old books which show up the 
atrocities of rome must be republish- 
ed their contents shouted from the 
street-corners printed on our patent- 
gospel press thundered from our pul 
pits down with the pope of rome

 stir yourselves up in the good 
work brothers and sisters let not 
your efforts slack whenever you

john calvin preached to servetus 
from the window of his chamber 
looking out into the open square of 
geneva where that same servetus 
a rank infidel was burning up with 
the good old doctrine which pro 
claims fire and brimstone the cardi 
nal points of the belief of the good 
savior jesus down with the pope 
up with fire and brimstone up 
with toleration up with the bi 
we 
ll - how the applause of the free be 



lievers and true repenters rose uf 
to the ceiling like the voice of si rim 
huge monster thunder was mere 
silence in comparison how the old 
ladies rose from their seats in extacy 
how the old gentlemen punished the 
hard floor with their thick-soled boots 
how meekly the three missionaries 
resumed their seats how warmly the 
brethren crowding round them crush 
ed their fingers with very joy and al 
most dragged their arms from the 
sockets with intense religious feeling 
but when the reverend pyne re 
suming his seat took from his coal 
pocket a large white handkerchief 
and wiped the perspiration from his 
red round face ah me that was the 
time for the applause a quaker 
city theatre with fanny ellsler on 
the stage and all the grey-haired men 
in the pit never raised such a round 
of applause as that death to the 
old pagan death to the pope of 
rome up with fire and brimstone 
up with toleration up with the bible 

when the excitement was some 
what subdued a faint voice was heard 
echoing from a far corner of the lec 
ture room and the light of the rusty 
chandelier fell upon the grey hairs of 
an old man who trembled nervously 
as he spoke

was an american citizen that his 
father had fought in the revolution 
at monmouth trenton germantown

upon the grave of old stephen girard 
leaving the pagan of rome to his 
errors for a little while and point 
to girard college that unfinished 
monument of a foul wrong done to 
ten thousand orphans and as he 
pointed might he not call upon the 
god of the fatherless to protect those

they silenced the old man with a 
hurricane of groans 

a catholic shouted brother

him over to the police 

 to think of his impudence 
screamed an old woman to come 
here an try to p ison our minds

after the old man was dismissed 
the free believers composed their 
minds in a hymn of pious import 
being three lines to the pope and one 
to the devil on the average through 
ten long stanzas and this finished 
brother pyne poured forth his soul in 
prayer 

prayer ho ho was that a 
fiend s laugh as he heard the mockery 
of that prayer ascend in tones of blas 
phemy to the very throne of god 
prayer hurrah hurrah was 
that the yell of all the devils gathered 
in the shades of death as they heard 
the name of jesus profaned and 
mocked and polluted by the hot 
breathings of yon round-faced hypo

daughter uttered in husky tones with 
eyes blinded by tears is this agony 
of a breaking heart prayer are the

the free believers dispersed a

hronged around the reverend brother

was he blessed in prayer and did he 
not hurt himself by studying so late 
at night 

down stairs followed by his loving 
congregation brother pyne pursued 
his way brother billygoat clinging to 
his arm while brother scissors 
with the three missionaries hung 
closely at his heels the alley was 
reached and in a few moments the 
saintly quadruple stood in the bye- 
street where a carriage waited for 
brother pyne with a stout lusty coach 
man on the box wrapped up in an 
unknown number of overcoats with a 
broad hat flapping its broken rim over 
his eyes 

 good night sisters good night 

brothers said brother pyne in a 

 tone of spermaceti smoothness 

 good night my children good 

night 

the door closed and the carriage 
drove off 

 he goes to his night-long studies 
after the truth cried brother scis 
sors wiping his nose with the cuff of 
his sleeve let pagan rome look 
out 

 dear heart echoed an old lady 
kt and so he studies all night does 
he a bringin himself to the grave 
with his zeal 

 the saints and martyrs are no 
thing compared to brother pyne 
meekly exclaimed brother billygoat 
expectorating violently on an old 
lady s bonnet let pagan-rome 
look out for its wattykin that s all 

meanwhile the carriage containing 
the foe of pagan rome dashed down 
the street like mad the coachman 
lashing the horses into perfect fury 
while a poor ragged loafer gliding 



from the side walk crept up behind 
the vehicle and assumed a quiet seat 
all to himself without saying a word 
to the holy preacher within or the 
white-coated driver in front 

at the corner of a wide street the 
coachman held up for a single mo 
ment he tapped the window of the 
carriage with the handle of his whip 

 vich vay he shouted in a deep 
hoarse voice 

down went the carriage window 
and the red round face of parson pyne 
was thrust out into the full glare of 
the gas-lamp on the corner 

 down town of course simon 
i ve got to visit the sick you know 

 in vich quarter

preacher and then the coachman 
cracked his whip the carriage win 
dow went up and the carriage rol 
led off while the poor loafer sitting 
behind chuckled merrily to himself 
and whistled for very glee

my mammy sold rags ha ha ha

the beams of a small lamp of rusty 
iron standing on the table near the 
firef gave a faint and dusky light to 
the doorkeeper s den devil-bug was 



 



mabel 






seated beside the table with his elbows 
resting on its rough oaken surface 
while his hands grasped his tawny 
cheeks the long finger nails sinking 
into the flesh like the talons of an 
eagie and spotting his face with drops 
of blood his teeth were fast clenched 
but his lips hung apart shrivelled 
with a fixed and grotesque grin like 
the smile of a fiend frozen into mar 
ble his thick matted hair hung over 
his protuberant brow and his solitary 
eye dilated and enlarged to twice its 
usual size glared steadily forward 
with one fixed and unvarying gaze 
the light streamed full in his face 
revealing each hideous feature in stern 
and immovable distinctness while the 
outlines of his deformed body and the 
details of the den were wrapt in a 
twilight shadow in the recess on one 
side of the fire sate the negro mus- 
quito his arms crossed and his head 
sunken on his breast while on the op 
posite side of the fire his companion 
glow-worm rested in the same atti 
tude and slumbered like some over 
grown animal who has been gorged 
with food their common costume 
the red flannel shirt and corduroy 
trowsers dimly disclosed in the light 
seemed to increase the outlines of their 
herculean frames while it gave them 
a wild and ruffian-like appearance 

alone in his den with his attendant 
satellites slumbering on either side 
devil-bug sat silent as though he was 
but an uncouth effigy of stone while 
his fingers digging their talon-like 
nails slowly in the flesh of his cheeks 
gave some indications of the terrible 
agony which was eating through his 
soul he hid sate thus silent and 



motionless for the space of an hour 
when the small door leading into the 
hall of the mansion was softly open 
ed and our friend brick-top clad in 
his array of rags came treading 
stealthily into the doorkeeper s den 

he started at the sight of devil-bug gt 
but in a moment advanced and laid 
his hand upon the doorkeeper s 
shoulder 

 you re a purty old cove aint ye 
now to run off and leave a feller 
in the lurch the old ooman s dead

smiled ghastlily why man i tell 
ye i can count the blood-drops as 
they fall patter patter from the 
holler skull to the floor 

and the solitary eye of devil-bug 
glared wildly from the shadow of his 
brow while the sweat cold and clam 
my stood out on his forehead and 
trickled down his swarthy face 

 and not to git the chest o doub 
loons arter all kin ye read feller

his lank rad hair down over his brows

will ye howsomever here goes into 
the doc-y-ments 

in a low toned voice still marked 
by his vagabond accent brick-top 
began to read the contents of the 
package 

at first devil-bug leaned over the 
table with a look of the deepest inter 
est but soon the details of the pack 
age seemed to tire him and he leaned 
listlessly to one side with his eye 
fixed vacantly upon the ceiling brick- 
top read on a name attracted devil- 
bugs attention and then a date and 
an incident he leaned over the table 
his solitary eye blazing with the most 
intense interest 

 look here youssir you aint 
a-foolin me are ye ellen did ye 
say 

 the werry same replied bricr 
top burying his face in the unrolled

package his attention also seemed 
rivetted to the paper and its contents 
for his glittering and snake-like eye 
grew more brilliant in its glance 
while the outlines of his countenance 
became fixed and compressed brick- 
top pulled his red hair farther over 
his brow until it almost concealed his 
eyes and then resumed the reading 
of the paper 

devil-bug listened with every power 
of his soul enchained by an over 
whelming interest his solitary eye 
dilated and flashed with excitement 
and the nails of his talon-like fingers 
were thrust into his tawny cheeks 
with a movement of involuntary agi 
tation 

 christmas eve he echoed re 
peating the words of the manuscript 
as they fell from the lips of the read- 
er christmas eve eighteen hun 
dred and twenty four hallo yous-

top raising the paper before his face 
 left her mother s house on that 
date 

 read on will ye don t ye see 
vow i m a quiverin i want to know 
the rest read on 

brick-top again turned his atten 
tion to the manuscript devil-bug was 
utterly absorbed in its details he 
held his very breath as he drank in 
each word and date and incident 

the second child died did it 
he shrieked starting wildly from his 
sea t now look here feller if you re

bein don t make a fool o me read

mas eve eighteen hundred ana

reading from the manuscript while a 
slight tremor was observable in his 
voice 

that s the date too that s the 
date cried devil-bug in a voice of 
the deepest agitation look here 
feller d ye see that arm the night 
arter she left this house i got a sailor- 
chap to print this here with injin ink 

and as he spoke devil -bug bared 
his right arm and thrust it forward 
into the full glare of the light brick- 
top gazed upon it in surprise on its 
brawny skin in rough characters 
was punctured this brief name and 
date christmas eve el 



and so ye know d her did ye 
exclaimed brick-top gazing in devil- 
bug s face with a piercing glance 
while his lip trmbled with some un 
known emotion werry singular 
that

bug in a tone of sudden anger 
 don t axe no questions feller but

brick-top again resumed the man 
uscript a name once more started 
devil -bug from his feet

 sure that s the name

man named dick baltzar who with 
his wife resided in the widow s 
house the jirst child howsom- 
ever let me read on 

the manuscript drew near its close

clenched his hands clutching his 
cheeks with a convulsive grasp devil-

bug listened to the closing words with 
breathless interest 

the whole of his fortune 
echoed devil-bug repeating the words 
of the manuscript luke harvey 
entrusted with the commission hey 
hey is that it 

brick-top nodded but said nothing 
well was it for him that devil-bug 
occupied with his own strange thoughts 
had no eye for his companion s de 
meanor a tear stole from brick- 
top s eyelid and rolled down his 
freckled face his hand trembled as 
he grasped the manuscript and his 
lip quivered with a tremulous motion 

 luke harvey muttered devil- 
bug he s a wild fellow and one 
of the devil s disciples who hold their 
meetings in this house a purty chap 
to have sich a matter in his charge 
he ll be here sometime to night and 
i ll have a talk with him gi me that 
paper will ye 

 i say old feller come now and 
uncork this mystery let a body 
know all about it that s a conwivial 
old devil 

devil-bug turned toward him with 
a lowering brow but as he turned a 
knock was heard at the front door 

 dig oft feller said devil-bug 
with great emphasis taint for sich 
as you to know what quality comes 
to this house dig i say 

brick-top lounged lazily toward 
the doorway of the mansion-hall 
while devil-bug unbarring the front 
door gazed through the crevices of 
the green blinds upon the form of the 
new-comer 

who s there 

 monk baltzar answered an 
assumed and artificial voice 



what had you for dinner to 
day asked devil -bug repeating the 
first part of the countersign of monk- 
hall 

 fire and brimstone answered 
the voice 

come in said devil-bug all 
right the gal s up stairs in the 
room i ll be up d rectly 

and as he spoke the reverend 
parson pyne strode silently across 
the floor of the den and with his face 
muffled in the folds of his cloak 
passed through the doorway and 
along the hall and up the stairs and 
in a moment disappeared into one of 
the rooms on the right side of the 
massive staircase on the second floor 
of the mansion as he disappeared 
a tall figure rose upward from the 
darkness which hung round the ban 
nisters of the staircase near the floor 

 parson i think i ve tracked you 
to some purpose said a deep-toned 
voice the girl your daughter and 
you in monk-hall i ll drop brick- 
top for a little while and assume luke 
harvey again in order to be ready 
for all accidents my game is a des 
perate one but i ll play it with a cool 
head and firm hand 

with these words he disappeared 
into the door of luke harvey s room 
and in a moment the sound of the 
key turning in the lock echoed faintly 
round the hall 

mean while devil-bug standing near 
the table in the centre of his den with 
his arms crossed over his breast and 
his right hand grasping livingstone 
mysterious packet seemed utterly ab 
sorbed in the contemplation of the- 
disclosures which it had revealed 

the sound of voices mingling con

fusudly together came echoing sud 
denly from the stairway leading to the 
banquet-room of monk -hall and 
then a rude burst of laughter resound 
ed through the hall mingled with the 
hurried tramp of footsteps 

 ha ha ha and so you drugged 
the brother with opium exclaimed a 
voice familiar to the reader that 
was an odd mistake of mine gus 
about the fellow s name 

to think silly should introduce 
him to you by the name of byrne- 
wood cried another voice and 
then ha ha ha the bridal scene 
oh lord that was too good wasn t

 very good no doubt very good 
gentlemen exclaimed a third voice 
but there are some jokes which 
cost a mint of money i rather think 
suspect that this amusing adventure 
is one of the costly class 

ere the words had ceased to echo 
in the air lorrimer followed by 
petriken and mutchins lounged into 
the doorkeeper s den their faces 
was slightly flushed by the kisses of 
that long-necked giant the champagne 
bottle and their entrance into devil- 
bugs s private parlor was heralded 
by clouds of smoke issuing from the 
segars which the trio carried between 
their lips

as he spoke a hand was laid upon 
his shoulder and long-haired bess 
stood before him her jet-black tresse 
hanging dishevelled along her vhite 
neck while the peculiar brilliancy of 
her eyes with the dark circle of dis 
colored flesh beneath each eye gave 
indications of deep and powerful agi 
tation 

well bessie what s the matter 






 see the charge of a certain judge in 
which he instructs the grand jury to present 
a certain hall as a nuisance because it was 
threatened by a mob and therefore it en 
dangered the surrounding property it was 
owned and used by negroes for benevolent 
purposes this latter fact furnishes sufficient 
apology for any act of outrage in a city where 
pennsylvania hall was burnt by the whole 
population because the object for which 
was built happened to be unpopular

musquito rising from his slumber 
slowly opened the inner door and de 
manded the watchword of the new 
comer it was given in a faint voice 
and in a moment the stranger entered 
the den he was a young man with 
a figure somewhat below the middle 
heighth whose elegance of shape and 
beauty of proportion was disclosed to 
every advantage as his sweeping 
black cloak fell carelessly back on his 
shoulders its collar of fur almost 
concealed by the thick ringlets of jet- 
black hair which swept along the fair 
face of the stranger it was indeed 
a fair face almost effeminate in its 
regularity of feature while its extreme 
pallor gave additional effect to the 
brilliancy of two large black eyes 
whose glance was full of fire and ex 
pression a small velvet cap placed 
jauntily on the centre of his head 
amid a profusion of black curls which 
fell waving over his fair brow as well 
as along his face and down to his 
neck gave an air of saucy daring to 
the stranger which won devil-bug s 
good opinion for him at first sight 
his form remarkable for its effemi 
nate beauty of shape was enveloped 
in a close-fitting black frockcoat but 
toned tightly over the breast with its 
dark hue relieved by a large white 
shirt collar that fell aside from the 
fair throat of the stranger 

 well young slim-waist who are

said the stranger in a tone which was 
evidently assumed 

 taint that no more cried the 
doorkeeper with a look of mocking 
glee devil-bug for ever while 
there s strength in these arms 
strike or to kill call me devil-bu 
and i m your man 

the stranger quietly seated himself 
beside the table and gathering tho 
cloak around his slender form care 
lessly tossed his dark ringlets over 
his brow and looked in the face of 
devil-bug with a long and penetrat 
ing glance 

portr it painter i s pose said 
devil-bug with a grin wants to 
put my phizzog in the pictur win- 
ders

voice widely different from the care

first

 do you consent said the stran 
ger gathering his cloak more closely 
around his form is it a bargain 

his eyes so dark in their hue and 
piercing in their gaze grew alive 
with a clear and flashing light that 
spoke the settled resolve of a fearless 
soul a deep flush mantled over his 
face and his lips were firmly com 
pressed while beneath the thick curls 
which fell over his forehead you 
might discover the settled frown which 
darkened his brows so regular and 
arching in their outline his breath 
ame thick and gaspingly and you 
might discern the throbbings which 



agitated his chest through the heavy

with a sudden start as he hurriedly 
gathered the folds of his cloak around

an in a slow and deliberate voice 
e ended the sentence by a quick 
whisper which he hissed in the stran 
ger s ears as he leaned over the table 
with his head thrown forward until it 
well-nigh touched the face of the list 
ener 

but we must depict a scene which 
occurred one hour before this incident 
of our revelations 



mabel 



chapter fifth 
dora and fitz-cowles 

we open this scene with a pifiiyre 
f -kneeling on the carpet of a princely 
chamber a man of some thirty years 
and more supports the insensible form 
of a lovely woman in his arms t 
dim light of a massive chandelier 
illumines the scene the dark-hued 
face of the man marked by massive 
features his stiff black hair descend 
ing to his neck in heavy curls his 
well-proportioned form clad in a black 
frockcoat all combined furnish an ef 
fective contrast to the careless loveli 
ness of the woman her fair-hued face 
turned upward to the light her long 
and glossy hair falling in tresses of 
jet along her shoulders white as snow 
while a night-gown of azure silk 
gathering round her form so swelling 
so lithe and so voluptuous in its every 
outline in negligent folds falls gently 
aside from her neck and reveals a 
glimpse of her bosom slowly heaving 
into viewj 

a dark and ill-omened smile rests 
upon the lip of the man as he surveys 
the beauty of the insensible woman 
while a gentle flush tinting her cheeks 
and warming over her bosom betrays 
her return to consciousness the mi 
nor details of the scene tell the story 
of the picture in her extended hand 
she grasps a letter with a convulsive 
grasp like that of death his hat and 
cane and gloves flung carelessly on 
the carpet his cloak thrown over a 
chair and the door of the chamber 
hanging wide open all tell the story 
of his sudden entrance and his surprise 
the back ground of the scene is sup 



plied by the furniture and the crimson- 
hangings of the chamber varied by 
pictures in massive frames and mel 
lowed into gentle twilight by the dim 
beams of the chandelier altogether 
the picture is an effective one worthy 
the genius of an artist who has a soul 
to feel and a hand to execute like 
ialey for instance whose pencil is a 
mine of un wrought gold 

 a lovely woman by jove 
muttered fitz-cowles and a deep 
one passions like a volcano and a 
soul fearless as the fiend himself i 
must take care that she does not out- 
devil me 

 is he gone dora exclaimed 
in a whisper as she slowly unclosed 
her eyes ha fitz-cowles then 
you know all arid half-rising from 
her prostrate position she gazed in his 
face with a look of the most intense 
anxiety 

 all dora echoed fitz-cowles 
with a look of vacant surprise 

what mean you 

as he spoke he gently assisted her 
to rise from the floor 

 know you this letter she ex- 
laimed in a whisper as she threw 
herself in the rocking-chair and placed 
the letter in his hands 

 your letter to me cried fitz- 
cowles with a start of surprise i 
ost it from my pocket-book sometime 
yesterday how fortunate for us both 
hat you found it 

 luke harvey found it exclaim 
ed dora in a slow and deliberate tone 
as she leaned over the table and 
luke harvey holds us in his power 
a single word from his lips and our 
secret is known to livingstone 

luke harvey exclaimed fitz- 



dora and fitz-cowles 



cowies recovering from the stunning 
shock of surprise which had thrilled 
his very soul as dora made the mo 
mentous disclosure and he was 
here and threatened you dora 

 not only threatened me but 
assailed me with deliberate and gall 
ing insult it is but five minutes 
since he left the room we stand 
upon the edge of an awful precipice 
algernon already it crumbles be 
neath our feet a word from luke 
and our plans are overshadowed by 
utter ruin 

he visits monk- hall to-night 
claimed fitz-cowles with his finger 
 his lip in an absent tone visits 
monk-hall with our secret in his 
possession a single blow and he 
were silent forever 

that blow must be stricken 
exclaimed dora and a deadly light 
flashed from her dark eyes as she 
spoke luke once silenced we are 
safe to-morrow morning living 
stone and myself leave town for 
hawkwood to-morrow evening liv 
ingstone will have to return to town 
on business and after he has set out 
dn his return you will arrive at 
hawkwood in the secrecy of night 
we can then arrange matters for our 
flight or otherwise 

 my plan is a plain and a clear 
one after livingstone has set out 
on his return to the quaker city i 
will arrive at hawkwood and then 
mounted on fleet steeds with suitable 
disguises we will leave the country 
mansion together and riding all night 
overtake the new york cars near 
burlington it is then but half a 
day s journey to new york and the 
steamer sails in the beginning of next 

 



week this is a straightforward 
plan dora and we would both do 
well to adopt it 

 i have other plans which may 
essentially alter our arrangements 
said dora in a deep and meaning 
whisper with that same deadly glance 
of her eyes however algernon 
do not fail to meet me at hawkwood 
to-morrow night but what folly is 
this while we lay plans for our 
flight luke harvey is telling living 
stone the story of his wife s guilt and 
his dishono 

 this harvey seems to hate you 
dora began fitz-cowles aloud 
but he finished the sentence by a 
muttered whisper by jove he 
is on my track also i learn from 
that buzby poodle whom i have 
been forced to buy that harvey was 
dogging the jew s heels to day that 
same luke has a spiteful black eye 

hate me echoed dora ha 
ha ha to tell you the truth fitz- 
cowies he was ltonce a lover of mine 
i rejected the poor fellow he has ex 
changed his love for spite and now 
would sell his soul to ruin me he 
must be silenced fitz-cowles 

she leaned over the table fixing her 
dark eyes with a meaning glance 
upon the face of her paramour fitz- 
cowles involuntarily averted his eyes 
and shaded his brew with his up 
raised hand dora gazed upon him 
silently and sternly for a sing- mo 
ment and then laid her fair wniie 
hand upon his arm 

 he must be silenced she re 
peated in that same deep whisper 

 the jew is safe by this time i 
have nothing to fear from that quar 
ter muttered fitz-cowles why 



mabel 



the fact is dora i hardly think the 
man would have showed you this let 
ter had he meant to betray you he 
will attend the banquet in monk-hall 
to-night and consequently cannot see 
livingstone before to-morrow by- 
the-bye where is the old fellow v 

 mr livingstone sent me word by 
the servant that matters of pressing 
business would detain him at the 
counting house all night until the 
hour of our departure to-morrow 
morning to be plain with you 
algernon i do not feel safe while 
this man harvey lives with the power 
of mischief at his control can 
you think of no plan to secure his 
silence 

 tut tut he is not worth our 
notice dora exclaimed fitz- 
cowles resuming his hat and cane 
and moving towards the door let 
him take his own course he is too 
pitiable a thing to cause one solitary 
fear by-the-bye you must excuse 
me dora i left a friend waiting in 
the parlor down stairs remember 
dora to-morrow night we meet at 
hawkwood 

 my disguise is safe in the next 
room exclaimed dora assuming a 
careless and languid manner by- 
the-bye fitz-cowles how does your 
club manage monk-hall are you 
assured of the silence of your subor 
dinate now if any person who has 
money to clear his way can enter the 
mansion i would not give a straw for 
the secrecy of the place 

 ha ha you women are so 
curious laughed fitz-cowles 
 anybody enter the hall non 
sense no one can enter without 
the password which is changed by 



the abbot every night old devil 
bug would murder the man who at 
tempted an entrance without the 
secret word last night i gave out 
the pass word for to-night fire and 
brimstone you know tart and 
expressive dora 

 fire and brimstone echoed 
dora rising from her chair and 
this jones or devil-bug is a despe 
rate sort of man is he not some 
thing of the cut-throat and the bravo 

by jove i should not like to 
empt his cut-throat skill but really 
dora my friend down stairs is grow 
ing impatient remember dora 
and he made a slight bow hawk- 
wood dora to-morrow night 

he closed the door and the mer 
chant s wife was alone 

she stood silent and motionless 
with her arms folded across her breast 
while her dark hair hung clustering 
over the fair bosom now rising in the 
light with the impulse of a dark and 
terrible thought her eyes dark and 
lustrous as they were at other times 
were now almost hidden by her com 
pressed brows while they shot forth 
a dead and glassy light which indi 
cated a mind buried in itself as it 
called up its most fearful elements to 
nerve it for the accomplishment of a 
desperate and appalling deed 
 my name whispered through all 
the town with epithets of scorn and 
contempt in the parlor the saloon 
and the theatre and then the daily 
journals who fatten on the garbage 
of private discord will parade in their 
loathsome columns the disgrace of 
livingstone the guilt and degradation 
of his wife my name will become 
another word for pollution and dis 



dora avd fitz-cowles 



 



honor shall this be never by 
all the energies of a soul which has 
a woman s passion without her fear 
never 

 the deed which i contemplate is 
most appalling it requires a firm 
soul and a heart which shrinks not 
at the sight of blood it perils a 
world to gain a world but what of 
that a sure eye and a firm footstep 
may guide thejrayeller unharmed 
along the edge of awful chasms 
which yawn to engulph him and 
echo his tread with the sound of 
crumbling rocks what cares he for 
the death that reaches forth its arms 
to grasp him so that he can escape 
by a hair s-breadth from its clutches 

 my soul is resolved before the 
dawn of day dora the cobbler s 
grand-daughter ha ha ha will fear 
no living witness of her guilt i and 
to-morrovv to-morrow catharine de 
medicis must ha ha ha must 
clothe these young limbs with a 
widow s weeds 

these words uttered she pushed 
aside the crimson hangings and dis 
appeared into the next chamber with 
a single exclamation 

 the disguise she murmured 
 the disguise which fitz-cowles 
prepared for our flight is safe in this 
chest 

meanwhile passing down the stairs 
fitz-cowles was saluted by his com 
panion who stood waiting in the 
hall under the light of the hanging 
lamp 

 cool my blood with a julap ex 
claimed the indomitable major rap- 
pahannock mulhill as he stood pick- 
ng his tefeth with a large bowie knife 



 but it s too bad to keep a fellow 
waiting in this way i say colonel 
did you find old livingstone in no 
then you won the bet 

i told you not to bet but you 
would replied fitz-cowles twirling 
his cane with a nonchalance air 
 you wagered a cool thousand that i 
would find livingstone up stairs 
how deuced foolish in you i never 
saw such a fellow for betting never 
by jove by-the-bye major there s 
a fire in the parlor let s walk in and 
settle the bet 

 oh we bloods down south are 
awful chaps to bet awe-hi replied 
rappahannock as his round face 
assumed an expression of deep solem 
nity why fitz my boy i recol 
lect one occasion when the head of a 
large family was buried it was my 
father that bets were made with all 
the heirs with regard to the length of 
the parson s sermon the odds ran 
strong on an hour and a half bets 
were freely offered ten to one that the 
jparson would not get done in two 
hours i booked them all the par 
son strong winded chap as he was 
broke down after the first hour and 
they handed the bets to me over the 
old man s grave 

 let us walk into the front par 
lor exclaimed fitz-cowles opening 
the door 

 but the most singular fact of all 
was that we had to use the old man s 
coffin as a writing desk on which to 
settle the amount of the various bets 
the parson waited till we had finish 
ed one fellow was mean enough to 
skulk out of his bet i licked him and 
we had a row over the grave 

 now major your wt was a 



 



mabel 









thousand vas it not cooly inter 
rupted fitz-cowles opening his pocket 
bock as if to receive the money 

 we had a row over the grave 
you d hardly believe it colonel but 
fifteen funerals sprung from that very 
circumstance why the amount of 
bowie knives and pistols which were 
used in that fight may be estimated 
when you are informed that a dev lish 
enterprising blacksmith in the vicinity 
made horseshoes from the fragments 
for six months afterwards the 
mulhill funeral horseshoes were all 
the go cool me with a julap 
by 

 your bet was a thousand dollars 
said fitz-cowles quite pointedly 
as he displayed the pocket book in 
his right hand 

oh my dear fellow i sha n t 
have a remittance till monday just 
make a note of it will ye by-the- 
bye fitz my boy i ll take you 
another bet that i don t get that re- 
mittance till tuesday 

 all right major all right ex- 
claimed fitz-cowles concealing his 
chagrin with the best possible grace 
 don t think i ll take that other bet 
fby-the-bye i am going to mrs tulip 
st smith s conversazione to nightj 
will you go with me major 

 what is to be did replied the 
major sticking his hands in his vest 
pockets cock fightin or a bear 
bait or any thing o that kind 

 nothing so refined you must 
alk of byron and shelley and mrs 
hummins or hemans 

 don t know much about byron 
colonel but as poor shelly gad 
didn t my next neighbor give him 
thirty-nine for runnin off with a yel 



low gal shelly was the worst buck 
nigger on ones place 

fitz-cowles acquaintance with the 
literature or the literary cant of the 
day was exceedingly limited but the 
remark of the round-faced mulhill was 
too strong for even his intellectual 
nerves 

 the fellow is a decided jackass 
he muttered leading the way from the 
parlor i say mulhill did you ever 
read a book in your life he exclaim 
ed as he lifted the dead-latch of the 
front door did you ever read so 
much as a magazine 

 didn t i haven t we all them 
pictur books down south steel plates 
in front depictin the feelin s of pussies 
deprived of their ma s and nice love 
tales full o grand descriptions of the 
way young genelmen an ladies dies 
for won another without so much as 
leavin a pocket-hank cher to tell their 
fate read the migizines wot po try 
wot sentiment wot murder an mad 
ness an mush-and-milk for a greasy 
quarter cool me with a julap by 

 hist look yonder major ex 
claimed fitz-cowles pointing to the 
door-steps of livingstone s mansion 
which they had but a moment left 
 who is that young fellow standing 
in front of livingstone s door who 
can it be a fashionable hat and a 
sweeping mantle egad he leaves 
the door and hurries down fourth 
street come on mulhill let s give

and why should i give chase ha

devil-bug in love 



 



yij to the utter astonishment of 
fitz-cowles the ardent southerner 
witn his red round face half-hidden 
by an immense shirt collar and his 
portly form enveloped in a white 
blanket overcoat commenced perform 
ing an irregular dance along the 
pavement of south fourth street tos 
sing his felt hat on high with one hand 
while the other grasped a slip of dingy 
paper and waved it to and fro in the 
winter air 

 what in the deuce do you mean 
folks will think you re crazy what s 
that letter about 

 what s it about echoed mulhill 
with a broad grin widening his fea 
tures nothin pertikler list a love 
letter from a g-a-l 



chapter sixth 

devil- bug in love 

 your name is 

as devil-bug leaning over the table 
sissed these whispered words in the 
er of the listener his face assum 
ed an expression of hideous glee 
his lips parting with a sneering gri 
mace while a multitude of minute 
wrinkles diverging from the corner 
of his eyelids spread over his swarthy 
skin in a smile of fiend-like triumph 
and scorn 

 my name echoed the stranger 
drawing the folds of his cloak yet 
more closely around his form while 
his hand with an involuntary move 
ment swept his dark curls more thick 
ly over his white forehead my 
name is 

dora livingstone whispered 



devil-bug resting the knuckles of his 
iron hands upon the edge of the tal le 
 the wife of the rich merchant 
alone and in monk-hall 

the face of the stranger became 
suddenly pale as death and then the 
dark eyes gleaming from beneath the 
mass of jet-black curls shot forth a 
glance of fixed resolution 

 beware how you whisper that 
name within these walls the voice 
was calm and resolute that spoke 
these words woman as i am it 
were not safe for you to dare my ven 
geance i came here for revenge 
you are the man to fulfil my settled 
purpose i have asked you to commit 
a horrible crime but you shall have 
gold for your labor gold sufficient 
to make you a rich man this luke 
harvey must die 

 it s quite a pleasure to hear her 
talk cried devil-bug gazing upon 
the face of the disguised woman with 
a look of gloating admiration to 
think that the creetur with them 
devil s eyes is a woman with a soft 
buzzim and a plump form ho ho 
ho luke harvey shall die good 
lady if you wish it but the wages aint 
to be paid in goold 

 what mean you exclaimed 
dora with a look of disgust impress 
ing the lines of her proud counte 
nance as she marked the expression 
of devil-bug s loathsome face 

 the goold i want good lady is a 
kiss from a red lip a little love you v 
know and a good deal o fondness 
that s my price i aint to be had on 
any other terms ho ho ho the 
han some merchant s wife in love with 
old devil-bug i venders how thar

mabel 



the bosom of the disguised 
rose heaving beneath the folds of her 
cloak and her dark eyes flashed with 
fierce indignation 

and dare you presume to hold 
such language with me another 
word of such insolence from your lips 
and by the heaven above me you die 

she sprang to her feet and flinging 
the cloak from her shoulders stood 
with her proud form elevated to its 
full stature while her fair white hands 
each held a pistol extended at arms 
length in an attitude of determined 
menace 

 look here musketer look here 
glow-worm aint that a purty sight 
you re the rale pluck i tell ye g-a- 
d ye mean them words as a purty 
speech or as rale sensible tolk d ye 
see them niggers suppose ye fire 
at yer humble sarvant d ye think a 
g-a- with yer soft bosom and smooth 
limbs ar a match for sich reglar iron- 
boned devils as them darkies i have 
seen ye afore gal and liked ye come 
to my terms and i ll come to yours 
a kiss for every drop o blood i shed 
on your account 

dora started at the sight of the two 
negroes nestling in the dark corners 
of the doorkeeper s den 

 oh madness madness she mut 
tered dropping her face instinctively 
on her bosom while her extended 
hands still grasped the pistols in their 
fair white fingers i have placed my 
name and reputation at the mercy of 
this fiend in human shape there 
are witnesses to this dark interview 
oh madness madness 

devil-bug quietly vnotioned his ne 
groes to leave the den as they crept 
through the door leading into the man 



sion he silently glided around th 
table and stood at the side of the beat 
tiful woman whose head still resteo 
upon her bosom 

 i like yer spirit he whispered 
fixing his solitary eye upon her red- 
dening face with a look of gloating ad 
miration if you want to leave these 
doors old devil-bug is not the man 
to stop you but look ye good lady 
if you but say the word luke harvey 
shall not see the sun rise to-morrow 
you go up stairs and wait till day 
break in a private room no one shall 
dare to molest ye when i bring you 
that ere ring which luke aint to par r 
with except with his life then ou are 
to pay me the the -goold 

dora said never a word but letting 
the pistols fall from her hands she 
sank in the seat and hid her face in 
her bosom while the long tresses of 
her dark hair escaping from beneath 
the velvet cap fell showering and lux- 
uriant over her neck and shoulders so 
beautifully disguised in man s attire 

 insulted scorned despised she 
murmured and by the man i once 
so deeply loved my name at his mer 
cy my whole fortune hanging on a 
chance word from his lips shall 
pause in my career of revenge this 
night and to-morrow safely passed i 
am countess of lyndeswold yes 
yes luke harvey must die at an 
arice at all hazards must die 

 lady what s the use of mutterin 
an mumblin to yerself is it a bar 
gain if it is jist reach out yer hand 
and let me kiss it 

 bring me the ring and you shall 
revel in wealth whispered dora 
raising her face slowly from her bosom 

 if you d a kept yer face hid a 



parson pyne and his daughter 



 



tninnit longer i might ave corne to yer 
terms but with the sight o that face 
afore me pd sooner you d come to 
mine i d sooner revel on yer lip 
good lady than to float in goold up to 
my eyes is it a bargain gi us 
yer hand 

dora slowly rose from her seat 
how beautiful she looked as standing 
erect in her disguise with her long 
dark hair falling aside from her face 
she folded her arms across her heav 
ing bosom and remained for a single 
moment silent and motionless the 
light fell softly over the outline of her 
form revealing the symmetry of her 
limbs so round in their faultless shape 
the swelling ripeness of her bosom 
heaving beneath the disguise of the 
closely-buttoned frockcoat the slender 
waist and the proportions of her figure 
widening with beauty below the waist 
and gradually narrowing again like 
the outline of an invented pyramid as 
they approached the small and deli 
cate feet enclosed in tight-fitting boots 
which reached mid-way to the knee 
she was very beautiful and her com 
pressed lip and pale forehead dark 
ening with a frown gave her lovely 
countenance an expression of deep 
and painful thought which disclosed 
the mighty struggle at work within 
her soul 

 gi us yer hand i said devil-bug 
as he glided closer to her side 

 the ring was all that dora 
found strength to murmur as with her 
face averted she slowly extended her 
fair white hand toward the deformed 
wretch by her side 

 this is the goold for which i bar 
gains exclaimed devil-bug as drop 
ping on his knees he app ied his loath 



some lips to the skin of that delicate 
hand before daybreak you shall 
have the ring and i the goold ha

chapter seventh 

parson pyne and his daughter 

 comfortable range of apart 
ments muttered the rev dr pyne as 
he entered a small chamber on the 
second floor this is my study a nice 
ittle room with a coal fire in the grate 
a lamp on the table a cupboard in the 
corner and a bed in the other this 
s what i call comfortable he smiled 
pleasantly as standing with his back 
to the fire and his hands under his 
coat-tails he warmed his respectable 
person and surveyed the room at the 
same time this is the retreat to 
which the foe of pagan rome retires 
when the labors of the pulpit are over 
ha ha i am blessed with an affec 
tionate and loving congregation dear 
people they love me i preached with 
unction to night powerful very pow 
erful unction and talking of unction 
i believe pll try a little brandy 

with that pleasant smile beaming 
from his red round face that smile 
which won him bank-note opinions 
from the wealthy old women of his 
flock and endeared him to the hearts 
of all the patent-gospellers the good 
doctor advanced to the cupboard and 
taking a corpulent decanter from its 
recesses poured himself a very toler 
able glass of blushing cogn ac sur 
veying the creature for a moment 



 



mabel 



with his one eye closed and his ful 
red lips dropped apart the reverenc 
gentleman after this silent pause of 
thought raised the glass to his lips 
with the emphatic sentiment down 
with the pope of pagan rome up 
with the pa tent- gospellers 

 good brandy that he murmur 
ed replacing the empty glass in the 
cupboard old swipes one of our 
elders who keeps a wine store sent 
me that brandy in mistake for wine 
it was intended for the use of our 
church on particular occasions i use 
k instead of the church which does 
just as well 

the reverend gentleman then seat 
ed his portly person in the large arm 
chair beside the fire and taking a cor 
pulent pocket-book from a side pocket 
he displayed its contents on his out 
spread knees 

 funds are easy with us to-day 
said the good man smiling as he spoke 
 my wants were quite numerous this 
morning to night they are amply 
supplied that ten dollar note came 
from a good old lady on account of a 
poor man who was run over by the 
cars a widow with five small child 
ren and one at the breast will doubt 
less be relieved when she beholds the 
twenty which was presented to me 
for her by an aged brother of our 
flock that gold-piece is for the poor 
man who fell from a five-story house 
with a hod on his shoulder this five 
dollar note came with a letter which 
defied the pope of rome in very strong 
language down with the pope of 
pagan rome yours shadroes shad- 
roe is a very zealous brother quite 
fiery and here is a fifty which 
was vendered me for the use of an in 



digent young brother about to com 
mence the gospel ministry there s 
somewhere near a hundred dollars in 
all collected by me since breakfast 
this morning a good day s work 
the rev f a t pyne chuckled 
pleasantly to himself and winked ra 
ther viciously at the small bible on the 
mantle-piece it was a very pleasant 
thing to behold thefruits of his day s 
abor resting on his kne in the shape 
of solid gold and bank notes and our 
admiration of the sight is increased to 
a positive reverence for dr pyne 
when we remember that the poor man 
who was run over by the cars the 
widow with five children and one at 
he breast the man who fell from a 
ive-story house with a hod on his 
shoulder and the indigent young bro- 
her about to commence the gospel 
ministry were all lively fictions in 
vented by the foe of pagan rome for 
he especial benefit of his two rooms 
and other conveniences at monk-hall 
ut this you will understand is a pos- 
tive secret and having been entrusted 
o us in strict confidence must on no 
account go any farther 

 a little opium wont hurt me i 
pine said the good brother taking 
small paper from his pocket which 
gteing opened disclosed a number of 
smaller papers all carefully folded in- 
square form with an apothecary s 
abel on the outside of each we 
emperance folks must have some little 
excitement after we have forsworn in- 
mperance when we leave off al 
cohol we indulge our systems with a 
ittle opium that s what i call a 
apita compromise 

the brother now arose from hi 
seat and quietly opened a small door r 



parson pyne and his daughter 



 



eadirig into the adjoining chamber 
a cheerful smile overspread his round 
face and his watery eyes twinkled 
with glee there was something very 
meaning in the energy with which he 
smacked his large red lips together 

 she sleeps he muttered and 
then with a quiet manner and cauti 
ous footstep stole into the chamber 
closing the door carefully behind him 

it was a wide and spacious cham 
ber with lofty ceiling and wainscotted 
walls a small lamp burning on the 
table near the fireplace gave a clear 
cold light to the hearth-side while the 
other parts of the room were wrapt in 
shadow like most of the chambers 
of monk-hall this room wore an an 
cient and desolate appearance the 
heavy oaken wainscot of the walls the 
chairs of massive mahogany with 
high-backs and carved limbs the small 
couch standing in one corner with its 
snow-white counterpane and spot 
less pillow contrasting with the heavy 
carvings of the bed-posts of dark wal 
nut the faded carpet on the floor 
and the elaborate wood-work above 
the mantel with the coal fire smoul 
dering in the grate below such were 
the characteristics of the ancient cham 
ber which was rendered dark and 
gloomy by the absence of windows 
from the lofty walls a small aper 
ture near the ceiling not more than 
two feet long and one foot high could 
scarcely be called a window although 
it was intended to give a faint glimpse 
of light during the daytime 

near the fire a fair giri dressed in 
spotless white was sleeping as she 
reclined in a massive arm-chair whose 
high-back thickly cushioned with dark 
velvet aiforded a geitle repose to her 



maidenly form the light fell mildly 
over her countenance disclosing its 
pale hues and regular features strik 
ingly relieved by the long black hair 
which half unbound fell waving over 
her cheek down to her shoulders 
her hands small and delicate and 
death-like as the whitest marble were 
clasped in front of her person and the 
light folds of the robe which envel 
oped her form like a death-shroud 
were softly agitated by the faint motion 
of her bosom heaving gently upward 
as she slept 

so like a pure and holy dream 
was the beauty of the fair girl as she 
lay sleeping quietly in the den of 
monk-hall that altamont pyne start- 
d with involuntary awe as he gazed 
upon his daughter s face her beau 
ty was of that peculiar cast which 
mingles high intellect and purity of 
soul with all the enticing loveliness of 
a fair young form soft limbs a deli- 
ate bosom throbbing with the impulses 
of youthful blood and a lustrous black 
eye beaming with the undeveloped love 
of a stainless soul her form some 
what below the middle heighth was 
marked by peculiar and characteristic 
beauties a neck fair and round 
wide shoulders the skin as white as 
alabaster and veined with delicate 
streaks of azure a slender waist wi 
dening into the lower proportions of 
the figure which were marked by the 
swelling outlines of womanly beauty 
and a small foot thrust from jnder- 
neath the folds of her dress 

her face was fair in its hues round 
in its contour swelling in its outlines 
the features regular the brow calm 
and eloquent the lips red and ripe f

 mabel girl i say will you hush 
this nonsense exclaimed parson 
pyne in an angry tone as he shook 
the maiden roughly by the shoulder 

the girl slowly unclosed her eyes 
and gazed in his face with a bewilder 
ed stare 

 oh do not hurt me father she 
exclaimed clasping her hands beseech 
ingly in his face 

hurt ye girl who talks of 
hurtin ye exclaimed pyne betray 
ed by his excited feelingsinto an 
harshness of dialect which spoke of 
the habits of his former life when he 
was not precisely a saint what 
d ye set there dreamin about such 
stuff and nonsense haven t i pro 
vided you a home where you might 
recover from the unfortunate state of 
mind which has possessed you of late 
dismiss that unhappy dream my 
child dismiss that unhappy dream 
now and forever 

brother pyne drew a chair and sat 
down by his daughter s side 

 and then father you think it was 
a dream she exclaimed with an ex 
pression of rapture warming over her 
face 

 to be sure i do mabel to be sure 
i do said brother pyne quickly 
 put your arms round my neck and 
kiss me that s a good daughter 

mabd reached forth her arms and 
entwined them round her father s neck 
she kissed him on the cheek with her 
lips now reddened with excitement 
but a cold shudder ran over her form 
in the very act she shrank back in 
to her chair as ihougl she had been 



stung by a serpent at this moment 
she looked very beautiful her swell 
ing cheeks were flushed with sudden 
life her large dark eyes beamed with 
soul and her lips so bewitching in 
their shape grew moist and red as 
rose-buds heavy with morning dew 
her brow white as alabaster and calm 
as death was eloquent with the silent 
intensity of thought which absorbed 
her soul and aside from that fair 
brow swept her raven hair falling in 
long and glossy tresses to her rounded 
shoulders and imparting a solemn 
beauty to the loveliness of her counte 
nance 

 oh father she murmured the 
night the night when i fled from your 
roof was it all a dream 

 to be sure it was my dear re 
plied dr pyne taking his daughter s 
hand within his own 

 did you not seek my chamber 
did you not oh horror horror my 
tongue cleaves to the roof of my 
mouth when i endeavor to picture 
forth that scene in words 

 tush tush this is all nonsense 
and as he spoke the doctor gently 
wound his arms around her waist

ther to you have i not rented this 
house for your especial comfort you

as i had lain down upon the bed to 
rest myself for a few moments a ser 
vant entered the chamber and set food 
upon the table before the fire he did 
not observe me father but i saw him 
and was chilled with horror at the 
sight of his hideous countenance why 
do you employ such a hideous mons 
ter father 

what brother abijah oh he 
ts a fine fellow a christian my daugh 
ter although his face is not precisely 
nandsome what are you thinking 
of now mabel 

and brother pyne patted the palm 
of her fair white hand while his arm 
gathered more lovingly around her 
waist 

of my mother she has been 
dead long very long has she not fa 
ther many and many an hour in 
the daytime when abroad in the 
street and at night when resting in 
bed have i endeavoured to recall the 
memory of her face or a tone of her 
voice or a smile wreathing her lips 
but in vain all is dark with me 
when i think of my mother 

 the fact is she died when you 
was a mere baby mabel think my 
child what a care you have been to 
your father how he has reared you 
up in the lord how from time to 
time he has filled your young mind 
with the teachings of divine truth 
think of this my child and then 
think of your conduct in leaving that 
paternal roof which had sheltered you 
from childhood forgive this tear 
mabel i can t help it 

the rev brother pyne was deeply 
affected if ever his oily face glowed 
with an expression of sincere feeling 
it was at that moment mabel gazed 



upon him for a moment and thru 
flung her arms around his neck 

forgive me my father forgive 
me 

 father echoed a hoarse voice 
and devil-bug holding a waiter in his 
extended hands glided from the doov- 
way and advanced toward the light 
 i say brother pyne here s the hoi 
coffee which you called for and ho 
cakes in the bargain 

as he spoke he advanced toward 
the table and arranged the contents 
of the waiter upon the white cloth 
which he spread over its surface 

 ho ho ho so the gal puts her 
arms around his neck does she 
there won t be much need of the drug 
in that case he muttered to himself 
as he arranged the supper equipage 
upon the table father indeed 
could i ave heered my own ears 

the girl raised her head from her 
father s shoulder at the same mo 
ment devil-bug turning on his heel 
to leave the room caught a glimpse 
of her face for the first time he 
started backward as though he had 
received a death-wound in his very 
heart the waiter fell clattering on 
the floor and with another start back 
ward devil-bug raised his hands and 
gazed upon the face of the young girl 
never in his life had devil-bug been 
seized with an agitation terrible as this 
his face grew white as a sheet and 
his solitary eye glanced forth from its 
socket with one wild and absorbing 
gaze once or twice he essayed to 
speak but the incoherent words died 
on his tongue 

i say brother what s the mat 
ter cried parson pyne gazing 
upon the doorkeeper with unfeigned 



parson pyne and his daughter 



 



astonishment going to have a fit 
brother 

devil-bug slowly advanced to the 
parson s side he reached forth his 
arm and laid his hand lightly on the 
girl s shoulder he spoke in a voice 
utterly changed from his usual harsh 
and discordant tones 

jllen he said in a low and 
softened voice whose gentleness of 
tone presented a strange contrast to 
the harsh deformity of his visage 
 ellen is this you or is it your 
ghost 

mabel gazed upon his face in silent 
wonder and parson pyne rose angrily 
from his seat 

 what means this insolence he 
shouted in a tone of blustering 
anger 

 oh nothing replied devil-bug 
with his usual grunting tone of voice 
 only that gal looks somethin like a 
gal i used to know that s all 

and he atrocb hastily toward the 
door 

 devil-bug cried fat pyne in a 
whisper as he hurried after the re 
treating doorkeeper is the coffee 
drugged 

 yes it is parson growled devil- 
bug with his hand on the door 

soh soh all s right then devil- 
bug you will lock all the doors after 
you if you please he added in a 
whisper you understand i don t 
want to be interrupted and mark ye 
if you should hear a shriek or a groan 
you needn t mind it 

 oh i needn t need t i echoed 
devil-bug while an expression which 
pyne had never witnessed before stole 
over his deformed visage parson 
you ve got the gal all in your own 



power the coffee s drugged and the 
doors shall be locked and we wont 
mind no shrieks nor groans nor other 
capers but you must answer me 
won quest in that gal called you 
father 

 did she tho replied dr pyne 
blandly i really didn t mind it 

 you aint her father then asked 
devil-bug with that peculiar expres 
sion deepening over his visage 

 of course not except in a spirit 
ual sense ha ha ha a spiritual 
sense you know 

 ha ha ha echoed devil-bug 
with a wild and hollow laugh 

 ho ho ho chuckled parson 
pyne in a quiet way peculiar to him 
self you won t mind a shriek 
groan if you should chance to hear 
one 

devil a mind replied devil- 
bug as he stepped through the door 
way you re a jolly cove you are 

and parson pyne caught the strange 
gleam of devil-bug s solitary eye and 
laughed merrily as he closed the door 
while devil-bug echoed his laugh with 
a hollow sound more like the groan 
of a dying man who struggles with 
death and madness at the same time 
than the echo of a cheerful laugh 

 he s alone with the gal he mut 
tered as he stood in the small cham 
ber where the parson had consoled 
himself with a glass of brandy and 
she called him father 

that peculiar expression which had 
been gathering over his face while 
conversing with the parson now 
manifested itself in a look of fiend-like 
hatred which convulsed every line of 
the doorkeeper s countenance sweep 
ing his thick hair aside he bared hi

protuberant brow to the light the 
swarthy skin was corrugated with 
thick wrinkles which stood out from 
his deformed forehead like knotted 
cords the shrunken eye-socket 
seemed to sink yet farther beneath his 
overhanging brow while his solitary 
eye gathering a strange light enlarg 
ed and dilated until its gleam grew 
like the glare of burning coals his 
pointed teeth were firmly clenched to 
gether and his lips were agitated by 
a hideous grimace which gave a gro 
tesque effect to the terrible frown of 
his brow and the fiend-like glare of 
his eye he shook his large hands 
wildly on high and clenched madly 
at the air with his talon fingers

squat on either side musquito with 
his back toward us extends his left 
hand and holds the iron between the 
bars of the grate and looks up in his

in a point near the nose and diverging 
toward the sharp and prominent chin 
opposite him glow-worm with the 
light from the table falling on his 
broad shoulders and the beams of the 
fire illumining his face rolls his large

d ye mind ye black devil 

seizing the lamp in his right hand 
devil-bug hurried from monk balt- 
zar s ante-chamber as it was styled 
and in a moment found himself hasten 
ing along the dark corridor which 
traversed the second floor of the man 
sion 

 i like this old place he mutter

mansion here was i born and 
here i ve lived all my life i never 
had a friend in all my born days but

dead-vault i ve had many a joke

devil-bug stood on the main cor 
ridor of the third floor which with 
another corridor meeting at right 
angles separated lorrimer s rooms 
from the other part of the mansion 
thus you might enter the walnut 
room through a door which opened 
into the corridor near the head of the 
stairs or passing along the corridor 
you might pursue the gallery which 
ran east and west until you reached 
the door of lorrimer s drawing-room 
passing through the drawing room 
you traversed the painted chamber 
the rose chamber and then entered 
the walnut room next to the wal

which terminated the range of lorri

he entered the walnut room the 
glittering floor gave back the reflection 
of the light which he held in his hands 
the place was silent and desolate 
with nothing but the bare walls the 
jark ceiling and the glittering floor of 
polished mahogany in the centre of 
the room lay a shapeless mass which 
moved slowly to and fro while devil- 
bug advanced and as the light flashed 
over its outlines resolved itself into 
the form of a human being 

 ha ha ha not more than 
twelre hours ago this lump o flesh an 
blood an broadcloth was a fine young 
gentleman who cut all sorts o capers 
in the next room cussed like a troop 
er and swore like a preacher a 
little bit o opium mixed in his drink 
and here he lays a perfect bundle o 
sleep and stoopidliy a werry con 
temptible thing is human natur 

he flung the blaze of the light full 
over the face of the unconscious 
wretch who lay prostrate on the floor 
his knees huddled up against his chest 
and his outstretched hands clutching 
the polished floor with an involuntary 
and ineffectual grasp long locks of 
curling black hair fell streaming aside 
from a young face which seemed to 
have grown prematurely old in the 
compass of a few hours the skin 
was yellow and discolored the lips 
wore a livid hue and the dark eyes 
glared upon the ceiling with a cold and 
glassy stare a thin clammy foam 
hung around the white lips and there 
were spots of blood upon the cheeks and 



hands of the unconscious man he hail 
torn the flesh from his cheeks in very 
madness as devil-bug gazed upon 
him his limbs moved with a faint mo 
tion like the last sign of jeparting life 
and his outstretched hands grasped feeb 
ly at the smooth boards of the floor 
the light flashed over his fixed eyeballs 
but they gave no sign of life no quick 
flashing glance that might betoken 
consciousness 

 ha ha ha i ll try it scream- 
ed devil-bug with a wild shriek of 
laughter i ve heard many stories 
about that same thing but i never saw 
it done i m jist the man to do it and 
jist in the hurnor to do it now 

he knelt beside the unconscious 
man and allowing the light to play 
over his fixed eyeballs he applied his 
mouth to his ear 

 hel-lo yous sir i say look here 
i am a-goin to bury you alive d ylt 
hear that i m a-goin to bury you 
alive god how the feller wriggles j 
d ye feel the cold clods fallin on your 
breast a ready ho ho ho i m 
a-goin to bury you alive 

a slight tremor a quivering shud 
der passed over the frame of byrne- 
wood arlington was he conscious 
of the meaning of the words whispered 
in his ear god alone knows but 
his limbs were agitated for a moment 
by a convulsive motion and the mus 
cles of his face worked as with a spasm 

i ll jist go an tell glow-worm to 
watch for me in the first cellar while 
i go down down into the lowest hole 
of monk-hall when the gal shrieks 
then musketer must whistle and then 
low-worm will strike the old gong 
and i will hear it although i m so far

pacing the lamp on the glittering 
floor he departed from the walnut 
room scarce had the sound of his 
footsteps ceased to echo on the air 
when the curtains leading into the 
rose chamber were suddenly thrust 
aside and the form of a woman with 
her long brown hair falling wildly 
on her neck came hastening over the 
floor of the apartment her hands clasp 
ed and her white dress floating loosely 
around her maidenly figure 

advancing along the room she start 
ed backward as she beheld th shape 
less form flung prostrate at her feet 
and the light flashed over her face 
while she stood entranced by the hor 
ror of the spectacle 

my brother my brother she 
muttered in a low-toned voice and 
then sank kneeling on the floor 

her long brown hair fell wildly over 
her shoulders and her face white as 
the grave-cloth was tinted in each 
cheek with a spot of burning red 
her eyes of clear and lustrous blue 
were marked by a fixed and glassy 
stare as she gazed upon the uncon 
scious form of by rne wood arlington 
the quivering lips reddened to a deep 
purple hue the brow animated by an 
expression as wild as it was startling 
the hand clasped tremblingly over the 
bosom faintly heaving beneath the 
folds of the white robe all betrayed 
the deep emotion like to madness in 



its indications which convulsed the 
soul of the ruined girl 

 oh brother she cried taking his 
hand within her arm you are dy 
ing and dying for me speak to me 
byrnewood speak to me call your 
sister by the name you used to love so 
well oh god she cried with a 
wild shriek as she swept the thick 
locks of his dark hair aside from his 
pale brow he knows me not he 
knows me not 

the eyes of the brother still glared 
upon the ceiling with that same fixed 
and glassy stare he betrayed no sign 
of consciousness or emotion a corse 
with all the outward marks of death 
and yet with the soul burning brightly 
within could not have presented a 
more ghastly spectacle 

mary took his cold hands within 
her own she kissed his wan and dis 
colored cheeks she besought him in 
low tones to rise from the sleep of 
death or to give but a look or a sign 
of recognition still he lay uncon- 
scious and motionless 

as she thus bent kneeling over the 
unconscious form of her brother the 
figure of a woman glided from the en 
trance of the rose chamber and stood 
by her side it was the form of long 
haired bess she gazed upon the ruin 
accomplished by lorrimer with her 
aid and a shudder ran over her form 
as she gazed 

 oh bessie they have murdered 
him shrieked mary gazing upward 
in the face of the woman while her 
blue eyes sent forth a wild and bewil 
dered gaze look he is dying he 
is dying and for my sake 

hist mary cried bess veiling her

 oh bessie lead me to lorraine 
for god s sake lead me he would 
not suffer this wrong there is some 
dark mystery i know overshadowing 
my very soul but lorraine is inno 
cent you are silent bessie you 
do not answer 

 mary will lead you from the 
 house said bessie in a hasty voice 
as she turned her face from the light 
 i will save your brother 

she hurried the ruined girl from her 
brother s side as she spoke 

he loved me bessie he would not 
harm my brother i would as soon 
suspect you of a wrong as lorraine 
there is some terrible mistake bessie 
but lorraine is innocent 

 great god it makes my heart 
bleed to hear her talk thus muttered 
bess leading the way into the rose 
chamber u every word she utters 
is a dagger in my heart ha ha 
she believes me innocent 

 let me look upon him once 
again shrieked mary darting aside 
from bess and flinging herself upon 
her brother s unconscious form 
 byrnewood oh speak to me oh call 
your mary by her name only 
a word my brother or a look or a 
glance he does not speak he makes 
no sign not even a glance for mary 
 and i am the cause of all this ruin 
ha ha ha i i see my father and my 
mother there there they stand gazing 
upon the corse of their son and 
they raise their hands they curse me 
with his death do you not see them 
bessie oh it freezes my blood to look 



upon my father s grey hair which he 
scatters to the winds as he asks hea 
ven to curse me 

she rose to her feet and with her 
blue eyes glaring at the vacant air 
with her beautiful countenance for it 
was beautiful even amid woe and hor- 
ror worse than death with her fair 
young face paled to the hue of ashes 
she extended her arms as if to wave 
back the spectres who stood beside her 
brother s unconscious form 

ha devil-bug returns ex- 
claimed bess silently gliding behind 
mary and gathering her form in her 
arms i ll foil him yet byrnewood 
shall yet be saved 

raising mary in her arms she bore 
her silently from the walnut room 

a moment passed and devil-bug 
stood beside his victim again 

 come my feller he cried rais 
ing the unconscious form of byrne- 
wood upon his shoulders you an 
me has got a little business to transact 
which ought to be done in private 

unheeding the muttered groan which 
escaped from byrne wood s lips he 
raised him on his shoulder as though 
e had been a mere bundle of mer- 
handize in a moment he left the 
walnut room and was descending the 
stairs with the unconscious man on 
his shoulders while his extended hand 
grasped the flickering lamp with a 
quiet smile on his lip devil-bug de 
scended the stairs and in a few mo 
ments stood on the floor of the hall 
opening into the banquet room the 
echo of shouts mingled with laughter 
rung around the place devil -bug 
rimly smiled and passing the door 
way of the banquet room stole cau 
tiously along the damp floor of the hall 



the pit of monk-hall 



 



and in a moment the glare of the lamp 
flashed over the grand stairway of 
stone leading far down into the vaults 
of monk-hall 

and far far down over massive steps 
of granite with solid arches above and 
thick walls on either side far far down 
with the rays of the lamp flashing over 
the void beneath with a faint yet gloomy 
effect like a light darting its beams 
along the darkness of some hideous 
well devil-bug pursued his way his 
strong right arm supporting the un 
conscious form of his victim flung like 
a bundle over his shoulder while his 
distorted face grew animate with 
that grimace of habitual cruelty 
which gave his visage the expression 
of an incarnate fiend and developed 
all the hideous moral deformity of his 
nature 

down down over damp steps of 
granite down down the monoti- 
nous echo of his footsteps disturbs the 
silence of the air and now and then 
his victim with his face hanging over 
the shoulders of the doorkeeper utters 
a faint moan as he feebly clutches at 
the door with his hands the stair 
way terminates on a wide hall with 
roof and floor of stone on one side 
the massive door leading into the 
dead-vault of monk-hall on the other 
side another door as high and as mas 
sive leading into the wine-cellar of 
the old mansion at devil-bug s back 
ascends the stairway of granite he 
advances along the stone floor and at 
his very feet descends another stair 
way more dark and gloomy than the 
first with clammy moisture trickling 
down the walls while the light flares 
fitfully over a long succession of stone 
blocks sinking far far down into the 



bosom of earth and night this stair 
way leads to the pit of monk-hall 

ha old devil-bug starts and 
clenches his hand and at the very 
thought of that fearful cavern sunk 
far beneath the earth below the 
foundations of monk-hall 

has the name of the place a terri 
ble memory for your soul devil-bug 
does no phantom arise before you as 
as standing on the verge of the stair 
way you gaze into the void below 
does no phantom with blood-dripping 
hair and ghastly eyes arise before 
you and scare you back the phan 
tom of a murdered man with a man 
gled jaw sunken on the breast a 
tongue lolling from his mouth and 
blood-shot eyes starting from a face 
darkened to purple by the hand of 
death 

ho ho what cares devil-bug 
for phantoms in his path or white- 
shrouded ghosts gliding by his side 
tderided and scorned by that fellow 
man whom he never yet called bro 
ther the offcast of the world from his 
very birth a walking curse and a 
breathing execration upon all mankind 
why should old devil-bug fear that 
phantom world which dawns upon his 
solitary eye 

ea ha ha old devil -bug loves 
the old arches of monk-hall he loves 
the cellars and the dens he loves the 
song of the revellers in the banquet 
room and the glee of the cut-throats 
in the vaults below he loves the ske 
leton-monk like a twin-brother but the 
phantoms ha ha they are at once 
his fear and his delight the mur 
dered man gliding forever by his side 
with the broken jaw and the starting 
eyes he hails him as a thing of ioy

and the murdered woman with the 
quivering form and hollow skull 
oozing with the slowly-pattering blood 
ha ha this phantom is one of 
devil-bug s familiar spirits 

but the pit the pit of monk-hall

nethermost cavern of monk-hall for

go down down with the form of his

the lamp held firmly in his talon 
fingers down down until the air 
grows thick with the breath of corrup

half price this feller on my shoul 
der don t move nor struggle vender 
if he thinks o th jolly things we re 
a-goin to do with him buried alive 
i do venders how that ill vork 

with these words devil-bug began 
the desent of the granite stairway the 
heavy echo of his footsteps resounded 
upward with a dull monotonous sound 



 will the reader pardon this digression of 
he author these critics are so apt to at 
tack an author merely because they know 
him to be young and suppose him to be 
friendless that our author wanted to get the 
start of them when he wrote this passage 
we do not know who the author means by 
the prince of lollypop but will simply state 
that in our opinion the poet has 
written some very clever things printer s 
devil 



as lighting his way with the extended 
lamp he went far far down into the 
darkness of the staircase once or 
twice as the moaning sound of the 
wind came rushing down the passage 
devil-bug started with involuntary 
surprise and with his burthen on his 
shoulder attempted to turn round and 
face the enemy whom his excited 
fancy had imagined pursuing his foot 
steps but the unconscious man gave 
a faint struggle and occupied with the 
effort to hold him tightly on his shoul 
der devil-bug smiled at the moaning 
sound of the wind and with his usual 
grimace pursued his way down 
down down was not that low 
pattering noise the echo of a footstep 
at his heels devil-bug smiled grim 
ly as the fancy crossed his mind 
down down down the old arch 
way above the staircase grows crimson 
with the light of the lamp and the 
drops of moisture trickling along the 
walls glittered like diamonds in a 
river s sands was not that faint and 
rustling sound the noise of a garment 
sweeping the stairs at his back half- 
turning devil-bug gazed into the 
darkness above but the thick gloom 
enveloped the stairway like a pall and 
his solitary eye might discern nothing 
but silence and night 

as devil-bug turned round he 
tossed the body of byrnewood rather 
roughly on his shoulder and the 
victim uttered a deep groan of pain 
and agony 

 oh groan little children groan 
as the nigger wot plays on the banjo 
ses but it won t help you the least cir 
cumstance muttered devil-bug with 
a hideous grin as extending the lamp 
in his left hand he grasped his victim

more firmly by the right and resumed 
his downward way you see the 
opium settled your hash and the safety 
of this ere commonwealth is in 
danger you must be silenced for 
the sake of monk-hall so what s the 
use o cuttin capers hello wasn t 
that a footstep i m quite narvous 
as the old women say howsomdever 
ere s the door the big door wot opens 
into the pit of this ere thea-ter 

he stood at the foot of the stairway 
before the massive door with timbers 
of oak and bands of iron time had 
rusted away the lock and the timbers 
in various places between the intervals 
of the iron bands were crumbling to 
decay devil-bug fixed his foot against 
one side of the door and it fell before 
him with a crushing sound whose 
echo swelled upward like thunder 

another moment and advancing 
over a floor of hard clay he stood in 
the pit of monk-hall 

it was a vast and gloomy place all 
full of oaken beams vising from the 
floor to the ceiling far above with 
pillars of dark brick massive and un 
couth in their outlines towering at 
irregular interval on every side 
where devil-bug stood at the foot 
of the stairway with the light of his 
lamp flashing fitfully around a few 
prominent features of the cellar or 
cavern were perceptible the stair 
way seemed to descend into the very 
centre of the place on either side 
the irregular light of the lamp disclos 
ed faint glimpses of massive walls all 
hideous with dark holes and obscure 
nooks while the extent of the cavern 
was as uncertain and vague as the 
gnostly shadows which flitted from 
the hard floor to the distant ceiling far 



above the floo itseli was crowded 
with rubbish and lumber of all kinds 
innumerable heaps of broken bottles 
gave evidence of the revels held in 
monk-hall in the olden time crum 
bling pieces of timber heaps of old 
boards and fragments of broken fur 
niture littered along the floor around 
the base of the heavy pillars and 
among the uprising beams of oak 
might have excited a momentary curi 
osity in the mind less calm and phi 
losophical than that of the doorkeeper 
devil-bug however treated all 
these things as matters of course and 
holding the light on high with the un 
conscious byrnewood on his shoulder 
he picked his way among the heaps 
of rubbish and advanced along the 
cellar he had not gone ten feet 
from the entrance when a whirring 
sound broke upon the stagnant air 
and then the trampling of a thousand 
tiny feet echoed to the ceiling of the 
cavern the next instant a crowd 
of rats whose immense numbers black 
ened the cellar for yards around came 
rushing across the path of devil -bug 
and with that same whirring noise in 
a moment they were gone again and 
then crawling into the strange glare 
of the light from the heaps of bottles 
and the piles of old lumber came ver- 
mine and reptiles of all kind and of 
every loathsome shape glittering 
house-snakes warmed into life by the 
foul air of the vault hung twining 
from the oaken beams and the brick 
pillars were half-concealed by thick 
cobwebs woven by noxious spiders 
who started from their resting places 
as the glare of the light flashed around 
the place devil-bug paused in the 
centre of a vacant space extending 



the pit of monk-hall 



between a massive brick pillar and a 
rising piece of ground which shoot 
ing upward at the distance of a few 
yards closed all the floor of the vault 
beyond from view on either side 
were heaps of crumbling lumber and 
rubbish and near the sudden elevation 
thick dust the accumulation of years 
of decay had gathered ancle deep 

as devil-bug laid down the uncon 
scious form of byrnewood placing it 
on the hard clay beside the lamp 
which burned dimly under the pres 
sure of the foul atmosphere a deep 
yet faint and moaning sound broke 
on his ears it was like the rustling 
of autumn leaves driven ashore by 
angry waves or like the rolling of a 
deep flood swollen by a freshet or 
perhaps like the far-off moaning of 
wind 

ihojiq-l-that s the underground 
stream o water which flows beneath 
the foundations o monk-hall and 
arter rollin onwards for a few feet 
buries itself in the ground again 
ugh he started as if stricken by 
ome fearful thought i wonder if 
his body was carried off by the waves 
this piece o ground is under the 
eastern range o trap-doors let s 
see with the light yes yes he 
added rising the lamp overhead 
 yes yes tender s the archway 
with the trap-door o the dead-vault 
cut into its bricks he must ave 
fell somewhere about here he stamp 
ed his foot violently on the hard clay 
but i don t see him now with my 
blind side that puzzles me for 
six long years an more that feller 
has laid by my side with his jaw 
broke and his tongue stickin out 
now don t see him and that does 



puzzle me cuss the thing i forgot 
the spade 

he glanced at the form of byrne- 
wood with a mocking laugh 

ha ha don t be dis-patient 
young man he exclaimed as turning 
away from the light he moved toward 
the door i ll have to go up stairs 
for a spade but i ll be back d rectly 
pon my word i will 

he disappeared in the darkness but 
in a moment stood beside his victim 
holding a rusted spade in his hand 

 reether old fashioned this he 
muttered i forgot it was down here 
you see my friend we used it some 
years back to bury a gal wot died ree- 
ther sudden as one might say it s 
been a standin against yonder pillar 
ever since a little bit rusty but it 
ill do 

while byrnewood lay prostrate 
along the hard clay with the glare of 
the lamp flashing on his face so wan 
and discolored the blood-shot eyes 
starting from the lids and the white 
lips failing apart with an expression 
of idiotic vacancy devil-bug cooly 
proceeded to dig the grave of the un 
conscious though living man chuck 
ling merrily to himself as sticking the 
spade into the earth he paused for a 
moment and spat in his hands like a 
laborer preparing for his day s work 

jpve hung a man in my time on 
bush-hill and i ve killed a man by 
the trap and i ve buried some few 
and i ve stole corpseses for the doc 
tors but i never did bury a man alive 
that s a fact not menning any harm 
to you but only waiting to see how il

a slight convulsive tremor was vi 
sible on the lip of the victim his 
outspread hands clutched faintly at 
the hard clay and it was evident that 
he was making a desperate effort to 
rise on his feet 

 this ere clay digs hard calm 
ly soliloquized the doorkeeper you d 
like to git up would ye no doubt 
i should if so be i was in your place 
what s yer idea-r o grave-diggin 
anyhow werry low business aint it 

throwing the hard lumps of clay 
on either side he gazed with his usual 
hideous grin upon the face of byrne- 
wood arlington as like to a corpse as 
ever was riving man byrnewood had 
relapsed into his former unconscious 
state and now lay with his fixed eyes 
glaring steadily upon the thick dark 
ness above devil-bug proceeded with 
his task plying the spade with all 
the vigor of his lusty arms he soon 
stood in a square pit reaching to his 
knees while the heap of clay at side of 
the grave increased in size now 
humming a catch of some dismal gal 
lows-bird song in his grindstone voice 
now muttering gaily to himself now 
filling the old vault with the echo of a 
jeep and piercing whistle which heemit- 
ted from his large mouth puckered toge 
ther like the end of a purse and now 
glancing slily aside at the form of his 
victim while that same devil s-grin 
distorted his inhuman face devil-bug 
made speedy progress in his work 
he soon stood up to his middle in the 
grave 

hello what could that be i 
thought i heard the sound o some 
body breath in behind yonder pillar 
o was it you hey i ll be ready for 
you d rectly that i will 



he again resumed his task a 
half-concealed in the grave he bent 
down to his labor a slight shudder 
like the faint indication of a spasm 
agitated the form of byrnewood then 
his hand clutched suddenly against the 
hard clay and in an instant while his 
chest heaved with convulsive throb- 
bings he arose into a sitting posture 
and with his long dark hair falling 
wildly aside from his wan and ghastly 
face he gazed around the vault witn 
an agonized glance that betrayed a 
fearful consciousness of his awful si 
tuation devil-bug turned from hi 
task aud beheld his victim he 
shrieked forth a horrible peal of laugh 
ter more like the howl of a hyena 
than the sound of a human laugh 

 ho ho hurray so ye begin 
to diskiver yer sitivation it s all 
werry good that you should know 
what s a-goin to be done with you 
specially when ye can t help yerself 
how ye sit there a-starin round the 
cellar as though you wos about tolt 
buy the primises pound me to death 
with pavin stones but this is a jolly 
sight 

laying down the spade he advanced 
toward byrnewood the half-con 
scious man shuddered as his torturer 
approached 

 hope ye ll excuse my not havin 
prayers at the grave he exclaimed 
as he laid his hands upon byrnewood s 
shoulder with a hideous grin convul 
sing his features you may shud 
der young feller but into that grave 
you ve got to go alive and kickin by 
god 

devil-bug swore by the name of the 
almighty and this was always a sign 
of deep excitement with him his so-

irtary eye blazed with that instinct of 
cruelty which was his soul laying 
his hand on the shoulders of the shud 
dering victim he dragged him slowly j 
toward the grave byrnewood s lips 
parted he essayed to speak but the 
effort was vain an incoherent sound 
like that uttered by an enraged mute 
was all that came from his lips 

devil-bug dragged along the floor 
and held him over the verge of the 
grave when a deep groan awoke the 
silence of the cellar devil-bug start 
ed as though a dagger had entered his 
heart 

 it s aim he muttered dropping 
byrne wood heavily on the floor it s 
that or nary feller who s been hauntin 
me for these six years he always 
groans when any thing evil s a-goin 
to happen to me it s him it s him 
ha there he is with his jaw broke 
an his tongue out and ha ha 
there s the old woman with the blood 
oozin from the edge o her broken 
skull 

leaping over the grave his hands 
outstretched and his solitary eye flash 
ing with superhuman excitement he 
receded step by step towards the 
elevation which arose above the wa 
ters of the subterranean stream the 
phantoms were before him in all their 
ghastliness and blood 

as he receded another groan sound 
ed through the vault and entangling 
his feet in some object hidden by the 
thick dust which had accumulated on 
the piece of rising ground devil-bug 
fell heavily on his face in a moment 
he rose on his knees and was about 
starting to his feet again when a yell 
of superhuman horror shrieked from 
his lips as he fell he had tossed the 



thickly-gathered dust aside and he 
now beheld the object which had en 
tangled his feet a ghastly skeleton 
with the bones falling apart from each 
other lay on the earth before his very 
eyes the blackened skull with long 
rows of grinning teeth the orbless sock- 
ets and the cavity of the nose all crim- w 
soned by the light of the lamp touch 
ed his very hand as he knelt upon the 
corner-floor he started to his feet 
with a shriek followed by another yell 
of horror 

 it s him the man i pitched thro 
the trap he shouted here he lays 
right under the trap-door here he has 
laid for six long years and now he 
wants to murder me ugh he 
moves them bony fingers as if to 
clutch me by the throat he grins iii 
my face ha ha he rises from the 
floor his bones rattlin against one 
another and his broken jaw droppin 
blood i say you devil don t touch 
me dont ye dont ah 

his soul fired with the sight of the 
terrible phantom aroused into life by 
the spectacle of the skeleton of the 
murdered man devil-bug retreated 
backwards with his face turned tow 
ards the light while raising his hands 
as high he aroused the silence of the 
vault with another yell of horror as 
the yell broke from his lips he fell 
backward and was lost in the grave 
which he had dug for another 

no sooner had he disappeared jn 
the pit than the form of a man sprung 
from one side of the brick pillar at 
the same moment that the figure of a 
woman advanced from the other side

 to his clammy lips 

 hello feller it was you that 
groaned was it shouted devil-bug 
as his hideous face appeared above the 
edge of the grave what in the devil 
d ye mean by them sort o capers any 
how 

 you infernal monster shouted 
luke harvey with an oath make 
but an attempt to get out o that grave 
and i ll crush your skull with this 
spade quick bess the antidote 
apply it to byrnewood s lips and lead 
him from the cellar while i hold this 
devil at bay 

 joy joy he revives shouted 
bess gently raising the form of byrne- 
wood from the floor the antidote 
has taken effect keep back the mon 
ger another moment luke and we 
will escape from the vault 

ye will will ye cried devil-bug 
grasping the edge of the grave with 
his taion fingers list wait till i git 
out o this his eye glared with a 
ferocious gleam as placing his knees 
against the sides of the grave he be 
gan to crawl from its confines 

 back devil you have made the 
grave and you shall sleep in it 
shouted luke as raising the spade 
above his head he hurled it full against 
ihe skull of devil-bug back devil 
you have met your match this time 



stupified by the blow devil-bag 
reeled back backward into the grave 
luke turned round and beheld byrne- 
wood standing erect on his feet with 
the arm of long-haired bess gathered 
round his waist while her shoulder 
supported his head 

 lead him from the vault bess 
exclaimed luke in a moment old 
devil-bug will recover from the effects 
of the blow and byrnewood may again 
fall into his hands 

 the antidote has restored him phi- 
sical but not mental strength ex 
claimed bess as her cheek grew death 
ly pale with the war of conflicting 
emotions ha she muttered to 
herself as she disappeared into the 
darkness of the vault with byrnewood 
walking unsteadily by her side ha 
it was in this vault that paul western 
fell when the trap-door sunk beneath 
him yonder his bones lay uncovered 
to the light and his murderess be 
holds them and lives 

luke stood beside the grave hold 
ing the spade in his hands while he 
gazed upon the retreating figures of 
bess and byrnewood 

 if i believed in any particular 
saint i think i d call in their aid just 
now a cursed scrape i m in again 
all from my my disposition to meddle 
in other folks affairs there i stood 
in front of my room where i had just 
left my character of brick -top 
together with the rags and the wig r 
when who should tap me on the 
shoulder but bess byrnewood 
arlington s in danger devil-bug has 
just now borne him to the vaults of 
monk-hall quoth the maiden and 
without stopping to tell me the particu 
lars she hurries down stairs liktf 



the pit of monk-hall 



 



wildfire i hurry after her old 
devil -bug is seen far below with a 
man on his shoulder and a light in 
his hand we creep along stealthy as 
cats close at his heels he enters the 
cellar places the light on the floor and 
commences his infernal orgies we 
steal behind the brick pillar and watch 
his movements bess tells me about 
the poison and the antidote i select 
my time for a melo-dramatic groan 
and here lies the result of that groan 
old devil-bug in the grave which he 
dug for another 

a deep groan resounded from the 
depths of the grave 

 oh you re there are you cried 
luke as his face darkened over with 
an expression of mingled hatred and 
rage suppose i try your own game 
with you how would you like to 
be buried alive 

with a mocking sneer playing over 
his features he struck the spade into 
the loose earth and threw several 
clumps of hard clay into the grave 
another groan came echoing from the 
pit and luke turned his jest into 
serious earnest by throwing one 
spadeful of earth after another into 
the grave 

 oh groan by all means it will 
do you good cried luke plying his 
spade with renewed energy an 
elderly gentleman like yourself who 
whiles away his leisure time in bury 
ing folks alive should hold himself 
prepared for any little contingincies 
like the present how are you off for 
clay eh devil-bug 

as he spoke the spade rose and 
fell in his active grasp and his face 
warmed with excitement the beams 
of the light fell over his slender figure 



and around the grave while all be- 
yond was impenetrable darkness as 
lude stood on the verge of the grave 
occupied with the use of the spade 
which he plyed so rapidly a swarthy 
hand stole quietly from the edge of 
the pit and moved as quietly over the 
hard clay as though feeling for some 
object and in an instant another hand 
with talon fingers appeared by its 
side luke did not behold these 
hands moving so quietly beside his 
very feet but absorbed in his occupa 
tion continued to shower the hard 
clods into the grave 

 ha ha he laughed as his dark 
eye gleamed with excitement old 
deviubug little thought of this when 
he dug the grave it was his turn 
awhile ago it s my turn now and 

 it s my turn ag in shouted a 
hoarse voice and the grim face of 
devil-bug all streaming with blood 
was thrust from the edge of the grave 
 there s sich a thing as playin pos 
sum young man 

he seized luke by the ancles and 
with all the strength of his iron-sinew 
ed arms gathered for the effort flung 
him to the earth in another instant 
he had leaped from the grave and 
stood over the prostrate form of luke 
with his iron-hand upraised while his 
eye blazed with rage 

 take that feller he muttered 
with a deep emphasis as gathering 
all his strength for the blow he struck 
luke on the head near the right 
temple luke saw the blow descend 
ing and tried to ward it off but in 
vain the blow descended and in 
another moment with a faint tremor 
quivering through his frame luke lay 
senseless as a stone 



 



mabel 



 no w for the ring cried devil- 
bug raising the left hand of luke in 
the light ah-ha here it is on 
the third finger and a werry purty 
ring it is he wouldn t part with it 
except with his life ha ha i reether 
guess that he ll part with the ring and 
his life at wonst 

bending over the unconscious form 
of luke he extended his hands and 
fastened the talon-like fingers around 
his throat with the grasp of a vice 

i wouldn t give much for yer eyes 
my feller he muttered tightening 
the grasp of his fingers until the face 
of the prostrate man grew purple and 
the lids of his eyes slowly unclosing 
revealed the bloodshot eyeballs start 
ing from their sockets it s my 
opinion you d make a bad subject for 
the dissectin table 

a deep booming sound like distant 
thunder echoed through the vaults and 
chambers of the mansion devil-bug 
released his grasp on the throat of 
luke and sprang to his feet it was 
but the labor of a moment to seize the 
lamp and rush toward the door of the 
cellar with his muscular right hand 
he raised the fallen door from its rest 
ing place and placing it against the 
door-frame as he stepped upon the 
first block of the granite stairway left 
the vault in utter darkness 

in a moment however the door 
was pushed slowly aside and the face 
of devil-bug all hideous with an ex 
pression of sneering glee appeared in 
the aperture while his extended hand 
flung the rays of the light over the 
darkness of the vault 

 he lays beside the grave ha ha 
ha and i ve got the ring he lays 
alongside o the grave and there he ll 



rot until his clothes fall piece by 
piece from his stripped bones ho 
ho the worms won t play all sorts 
o games with his eyes o course 
not nor strip the flesh from his 
skull nor fatten on his lips until the 
white teeth grin for joy nobody 
thinks o such a thing ha there 
goes the gong agin i must tend to 
the wants o parson pyne 

the incarnate sneer which played 
over his countenance suddenly gave 
place to that peculiar expression 
which had agitated his visage an hour 
before in the presence of parson pyne 
and his fair daughter what was 
the meaning of this expression it were 
difficult to tell but it drew the eye 
brows down from the protuberent fore 
head of devil-bug until the sockets 
were nearly hidden by their thick and 
uneven hair it compressed his wide 
mouth with an expression as grotesque 
as it was determined while his solitary 
eye grew alive with a deadly and glar 
ing light like the white heat on a bar 
of iron there was revenge in that 
expression and memory and love 
the heart of the monster suddenly be 
came a chaos over whose tumultuous 
clouds of storms and darkness a 
single ray of light streaming from the 
fair distance revealed a gentle form 
with arms outstretched in mercy and 
a fair face animated with a smile of 
love 

nell muttered devil-bug be 
tween his clenched teeth it s werry 
long ago since i saw yer face he 
paused suddenly while some dim 
memory seemed struggling from the 
chaos of his soul i don t know 
much about it now but if it is if it i 
i say then he shall die by inches 



the pit of monk-hall 



 



or there ain t no sich person as devil- 
bug 

he closed the door of the vault and 
all was darkness close beside the 
grave cold and stiffening lay the form 
of luke harvey with the rats who 
were so soon to hold their revel on his 
 flesh already crawling around their 
prey and snuffing their banquet in the 
tainted air of the vault close beside 
the grave lay the skeleton of the mur 
dered man mouldering to dust in 
darkness and silence as it had lain 
for years and the sullen stream of the 
vault still rolled moaningly onward 
its sluggish waves chaunting a rude 
death-song for the slain the nooks 
and crannies of the vault took up the 
echo of the flood and on all sides a 
low-muttered murmur swelling to the 
arching roof above seemed but the 
whispered tones of fiends chuckling 
with glee as they spoke of the murders 
done in the pit of monk-hall 

meanwhile along the rough steps 
of granite long-haired bess support 
ing the head of byrnewood on her 
shoulder while her arm encircled his 
waist endeavoured to lead the half- 
conscious man as the distant echo of 
voices came muttering to her ear from 
the pit of monk-hall whose door lay 
but a few yards at her back 

he is yet unconscious she mur 
mured as the head of byrnewood 
pressed heavily on her shoulder 
the stairs are dark and his foot 
steps are faint and trembling but he 
shall yet be saved 

and thus in silence and suspense 
she led him up the lofty stairs until 
they stood on the floor of the hall in 
front of the banquet room here his 



strength seemed to fail him but the 

gtrave woman gathered her arm yet 

ighter around his waist and hurried 

rim along the stairs leading to the 

first floor of monk-hall then the 

nassive stairway of the mansion was 

assed and in a few moments bess 

nd her charge stood in the darkness 

of the hall on the second floor 

 the secret door lies this way 
she murmured leading him toward 
he northern end of the hall the 
secret door leading to the well room 
monk-hall a private staircase 
juilt in the walls between the mansion 
and the tower building leads down 
nto a narrow entry this entry once 
raversed he will stand in the well 
room which is on the ground floor 
of the tower building a narrow 
door separates him from the yard 
that door passed the fence scaled 
and a long alley traversed he will 
gain the wide street he will be saved 
ha devil-bug approaches i hear his 
footstep on the stairs 

 my sister my sister murmured 
byrnewood speaking for the first time 

ah i have been entangled in the 
mazes of some horrible dream whew 
am i whose hand is this upon my 
shoulder and this darkness what 
does it mean 

the antidote has taken full effect 
cried bess in a tone of joy his 
strength is restored this way sir 
this way she continued leading him 
toward the secret door down the 
private staircase and through the small 
room at its foot you will enter the 
yard of monk-hall scale the fence 
and you are saved quick or all la 
lost ha mark you the gleam of that 
light flashing from the stairway along 



 



ma bel 



the entry devil-bug approaches and 
all is lost 

the light flashing up the stairway 
faintly illumined the hall byrnewood 
pressed his hands madly to his brow 
as if in the effort to awake himself 
from some horrible dream then a 
sudden glow flushed over his face and 
with a rude movement of his arm he 
flung bess aside 

 ha i remember it all my sis 
ter and the drug it comes like a 
lightning flash upon my soul and 
you you were one of the minions of 
the seducer back back touch me 
not your hand is as polluted as 
your soul 

 quick pass through the secret 
door and gain the well-room or you 
are devil-bug s prisoner once more 

 leave monk-hall and my sister in 
the power of the seducer never 
oh mary my own true sister i will 
save you yet the villain shall pay 
for his crime with his life your wrong 
shall be washed out in the blood of the 
seducer 

exerting all her strength for the ef 
fort bess seized him by the shoulder 
and forced him through the narrow 
doorway 

 quick or all is lost she shriek 
ed before god i swear to rescue 
your sister from the foul den of monk- 
hall away away 

as she spoke the light grew more 
vivid along the stairway and devil- 
bug stood on the floor of the hall at 
a glance he beheld bess and the form 
of byrnewood as he stood in the nar 
row door he hailed them with a yell 
and holding the light in his hand rush 
ed wildly forward 

 now will you fly shouted bess 



 delay one moment longer and youi 
life is in this monster s power yom 
sister is lost forever away 

 i go shouted byrnewood aa 
his wan face reddened with a gleam 
of excitement but i will return 
again with the power to avenge my 
sister s wrong let the seducer and 
his minions make the most of their 
hour of crime my hour will come 
and my sister s wrong shall be washed 
out in her seducer s blood 

bess hurried him through the door 
way and his footsteps were heard upon 
the stairs devil-bug stood before the 
tall woman his face darkened by a 
hideous frown 

 well you she-devil so you ve let 
that feller escape have ye he mut 
tered as he approached her with a 
look that boded no good 

 he has escaped thank heaven he 
has escaped cried bess as her dark 
eye fired with triumph while her 
proud form towered to its full stature 

devil-bug made no reply but fold 
ing his arms across his chest with the 
light in one hand he inclined his head 
to one side as if in the act of listen 
ing to some far-off sound 

in a moment a crushing sound like 
the peal of musquetry came thunder 
ing up the private staircase 

 d ye hear that shouted devil- 
bug as his eye flashed with an express 
ion of malignant triumph d ys 
hear that sound g-a- ho ho ho 
yer feller passes down the stairs he 
passes the entry he crosses the room 
ha ha ha in the centre of that 
room is the old well of monk-hall ki- 
vered with loose boards yer feller 
tries to cross that room ho ho ho 
the loose boards don t give way be- 



the pit of m jnk-hall 



 



neath nis feet what does that crash 
mean you ve made a purty spot of 
business of this matter i do declare 

great god he is lost cried 
bess turning white as a sheet in the 
face but i will save him yet 
she cried opening the secret door 
even yet i will foil ye monster and 
devil that you are 

 werry likely g-a-l werry likely 
exclaimed devil-bug quietly interpo 
sing between her form and the door 
 but jist now you ll retire to yer 
apartments arter this minnit consi 
der yerself a pris ner go home 
bessie he continued with his habi 
tual sneer go home little g-a-l 
yer mommy s got short cakes an cof 
fee for supper she wants you don t 
you hear her callin 

bess calmly folded her arms and 
while a dark frown marred the beauty 
of her countenance she m vod r lowly 
toward the staircase o r mansion 

 fine gal that iwoklod devil- 
bug eyeing her retreating form 
 only she takes too much opium in 
her brandy now an then but bess 
is a screamer when her dander is riz 
a reg lar hell-cat for all sorts o devil 
ment 

bess slowly turned her head over 
her shoulder and with her eyes flash 
ing with concentrated rage whispered 
a single name 

 paul western she exclaimed 
with her eyes fixed on devil-bug s 
face 

what d ye mean by that hey 
you she-devil cried devil-bug ad 
vancing with a threatening gesture 

 what do i mean echoed bess 
with a bitter sneer why i mean 
that your account is almost full the 



blood of paul western clings to youi 
skirts and look there devil-bug 
look there she exclaimed pointing 
to the vacant air at his back do 
you not see his skeleton standing at 
your shoulder look look the 
long bony fingers are grasping for 
your throat 

devil-bug turned round with an in 
voluntary shudder when he looked 
toward the stairway again bess had 
disappeared 

 that g-a-l is a born devil he 
muttered howsomdever i ll go 
down stairs and see if that feller is 
ralely done for 

he disappeared through the private 
door and for a few moments the 
hall was wrapt in darkness 

 all right jist as if i d done it my 
self he cried as he was again visi 
ble through the aperture of the door 
way the boards all broke and 
smashed and a heap o clothes flutter- 
in and movin near the bottom of the 
well 

he laughed with ungovernable glee 
but in a moment the expression of his 
hideous face was shadowed by a hea 
vy frown 

 the g-a-l he muttered here 
i ve been foolin my time away with 
trifles when when 

as he spoke he entered the door of 
dr pyne s ante-chamber

c ls it not beautiful my child is it 
not beautiful 

as he spoke with his knees spread 
very wide apart from each other and 
the cup of coffee placed on one knee 
the reverend doctor waved the silver 
spoon to and fro nodding all the 
while and glancing with a curious 
look at the fair face of mabel who 
was seated opposite we say curious 
look because he was a good minister 
and it would not do to call that sen 
sual glance gleaming through half- 
closed eyelids humid with unhealthy 
moisture by its proper name 

 what is beautiful asked ma- 
bel as she raised the cup of coffee to 
her lips 

 to think that a berry should grow 
in the ground continued alamont 
pyne glancing aside at the face of 
his daughter while he beat a tattoo 
on the saucer with the end of the 
spoon to think that a berry should 
grow in the ground and that that 
simple berry by a mysterious decree 
of providence should in the course 
of time assume the appearance of a 
cup of coffee 

the rev dr pyne raised his wa 
tery eyes heavenward but in an in 
stant as though impelled by some 
strange charm he fixed them upon 
the face of abel with that same 
gloating expression of fatherly affec 
tion fatherly affection by all 
means 

 drink your coffee my love 
drink it will do you good said the 
rev pyne with an unctuous fatness 



of voice nothing like coffee to 
raise your spirits specially he ad- 
ded in a cheerful whisper specially 
when it is spiced with a drug or two 

 i feel so strange father exc airn- 
ed mabel passing her white hand over 
her brow there is a burning sen 
sation on my forehead and my eyes 
pain me oh father can i indeed bo 
going mad the room is filled with 
strange forms and i feel as though 
an invisible hand was dragging me 
over a frightful precipice 

her dark eyes suddenly assumed 
a wild and unearthly light in an in 
stant the lids seemed to have shrunken 
away from the eyeballs and each 
eye dilating to an unnatural size as 
sumed a strange lustre rendered 
more apparent and striking by the 
utter paleness of the countenance 
with a single vivid spot of red crim 
soning the centre of each swelling- 
cheek even the lips of the maiden 
assumed an unnatural hue sud 
denly their moist vermilion changed 
to a warm and unhealthy purple 

 father father she cried i am 
going mad for god s sake save 
me save me the room sinks from 
beneath my feet the air is filled with 
horrible phantoms and oh save me 
save me 

she fell back into the chair and 
covered her face with her hands 

 this is the first stage of the po- 
lion blandly whispered dr pyne 
as his red face with its rubicund 
cheeks flushed all over with deep 
crimson assumed an expression of the 
most decided character at first she 
will be frightened then she will fall 
into a gentle doze and then ah then 
he took her fair while hand within

his own and patted it playfully against 
his oily cheek no one shall hurt

you go to sleep that s a dear ma 
bel 

her form thrown back in the chair 
with the limbs disposed in a careless 
and therefore voluptuous position 
mabel gazed at her father with a wild 
stare as though she did not compre 
hend the meaning of his words she 
looked supremely beautiful as with 
her dark hair falling in heavy masses 
aside from her pale face she surren 
dered one hand to her father while 
the other rested upon the white skin 
of her neck just where it began to ex 
pand into the virgin bosom 

i gave devil-bug three potions 
sometime ago muttered dr pyne as 
he drew his chair to the side of the be 
wildered girl one kills the other 
makes crazy the third makes love 
or rather disposes a sweet young girl 
for the exercise of that delightful sen 
timent 

father look look there at 
at your very shoulder stands a skele 
ton winding a grave-shroud round 
your limbs oh father for heaven s 
sake do not suffer it to stand there 
with its bony fingers on your cheek 

 ugh the girl scares the life out 
of one cried dr pyne jumping 
from his chair ah-ha she begins 
to doze how beautiful that pale 
face so round in its outlines with the 
spot of red on each cheek those lips 
they change from purple to red 
again falling slightly apart that 
glimpse of a soft bosom ah-ha 
she does begin to doze 

mabel s head dropped lightly on 
her shoulder and her eyelids slowly 
 



closed her long dark hair fell 
showering over her white shoulders 
her arms sank stiffly by her side 
she lay silent and motionless as 
though suddenly stricken by the hand 
of death 

the rev dr pyne rose slowly 
from his seat he smacked her lips 
with unctuous fervor and then taking 
his watch from the fob he strode 
quietly up and down the room 

 this is the second stage of the 
potion he whispered looking at the 
watch the third stage is the most 
delightful of all that paleness will 
give place to a peach-like bloom that 
stiffness of limb will be overcome by 
a voluptuous languor that closed eye 
when its lids again unclose will fire 
with passion and flash with all the be 
witching softness of a woman s lovie 
it now wants ten minutes of twelve 
o clock at twelve the dear child 
will be in my power the care and 
trouble of seventeen years will be well 
repaid ah-ha i remember i have 
to preach the anniversary sermon of 
the gospellers on christmas night 
let me think it over 

mabel still lay silent and uncon 
scious her hands dropped listlessly 
by her side while her cheeks were 

le and colorless as death 

 yes yes soliloquized the pious 
dr pyne i might touch up the 
gospellers on that score i might 
talk of my wonderful conversion my 
sudden reform my glorious change 
from darkness to light yes bretheru 
and sisters he continued striking an 
attitude as though surveying his con 
gregation from the heighth of the pul 
pit seventeen years ago i was a

subsiding from his pulpit attitude 
the good brother approached the un 
conscious girl a warm glow brighten 
ed freshly over her pale face and her 
dark eyes half-closed gave forth a 
sparkling glance moistened with pas 
sion while the pious minister stood 
gazing upon her with a look as pure 
as the glance from the bloodshot eye 
of a satyr her form relaxing from its 
rigidity of muscle began to assume 
the flowing outlines of voluptuous 
beauty she grew radiant with pas 
sion the red lips slightly parted 
revealing the teeth like pearls the 
young bosom heaving with life the 
face warmed with a burning flush and 
the eye large dark and lustrous 
humid with the moisture of passion 
alas for mabel now the potion ad-

had aroused her animal nature m

ing image of that voluptuousness 
which is at once the charm and the 
curse of woman 

 come kiss your father said dr 
pyne extending his arms towards the 
girl that s a good child kiss 
your papa 

mabel gazed upon him with wander 
ing glance it was evident that while 
her animal nature was aroused into 
full development her intellectual 
powers were for the moment crushed 
if not utterly broken the glance 
which rested upon dr pyne s face 
was humid with passion but it was 
the glance of an idiot 

 the potion works like a miracle 
murmured the parson as his rubicund 
face warmed with a ruddy glow while 
his watery eyes with the veins of 
each pupil filled with discolored blood 
stood out from their very sockets with 
a look of gloating admiration come

from her dark eye grew more soft 
and mellowed with the moisture of

rose heaving from beneath the folds 
of her night robe

his neck with her round arms he 
felt her tiny fingers playing with the 
thin locks of his hair the parson s 
face grew more crimson and his arms 
gathered more closely around his 
daughter s waist

whispered doctor pyne kissing her 
red lips and it will come and sit

he drew the fair girl to his knee his

more closely round her waist

hering new fire every instant her 
cheek blooming with unnatural fresh 
ness while her extended hands with 
he long fingers trembling in the light 
xrinted fixedly in his face oh how 
beautiful the picture a vivid imper 
sonation of beauty mere animal love- 
iness yet still bewitching loveliness 
utterly deprived of intellect the 
ong dark hair falling over the shoul 
ders the erect attitude the extended 
arms and the flowing robes of snowy 
white the large dark eyes dilating 
very instant and swimming in a 
strange light the pale face with the 
burning freshness in the centre of each 
heek the red lips and the young bo 
som rising faintly into view oh 
beautiful as a dream and yet more 
terrible than death

sounded like the shriek of his evil

 come girl no more of this he 
advanced fiercely toward the maiden 
his hands were clenched and his 
brow was darkened by a frown no 
more of this your shrieks will 
arouse the neighborhood i have 
trifled too long 

ha ha ha louder and 
more terrible arose that shriek of ma 
niac laughter

white fragments fluttered in his hatids 
another moment and his arms were 
around her waist his foul lips stain 
ed her bosom with a kiss 

a wild light flashed from the eyes 
of the girl her cheek grew pale as 
death and then crimson as the dawn 
her soul was struggling with her ani 
mal nature she tossed her arms 
aloft she tore her form from the em 
brace of the priestly villian she tried 
to cover the round globes of her bo 
som with outspread fingers of her 
fair white hands 

 damnation shouted the preach 
er as his round face grew purple 
with rage 

 you shall not foil me this time 

maddened with lust and rage he 
advanced he gathered the quivering 
waist of the girl within his vigorous 
arm she struggled and writhed and 
leapt from her very feet in the effort 
to tear herself from his grasp he 
raised his clenched hand and oh vil 
lian and dastard he struck her to 
the floor her white bosom received 
the blow along one round and 
snowy globe a dark streak of purple 
burst from the skin and stamped the 
traces of his violence 

she lay prostrate on the floor her 
breath heaving with convulsive gasps 
her form quivering like a leaf her 
cheek white as marble he knelt by 
her side he the profaner of god s 
sacrament the violator of god s truth 
the blasphemer of god s name he 
knelt before the crazed girl he ga 
thered her form in his arms he kiss 
ed her death-cold lips one more ef 
fort sweet mabel with one convul 
sive bound she sprang from his em- 
orace again sunk kneeling on the 



floor and raised her hands and eyes 
to heaven 

 oh mother she cried in tones 
that would have melted the heart of 
the fiend in hell oh mother 
save your child 

and her eyes were upward cast and 
her hands were outstretched as if to 
grasp the phantom-form which her 
crazed fancy beheld floating in the 
darkened air 

 you cannot escape me now 
shouted pyne in a voice grown hoarse 
with passion mine you are by 
heaven and mine by hell ho ho 
my beauty you ran away from my 
house did you you placed my cha 
racter in jeopardy did you ho ho 
my beauty we ll see who s master 
now 

he rushed toward the girl she 
rose from the floor and retreated to 
ward a dark corner of the room her 
face turned over her shoulder hei 
long dark hair floating down her 
back the white hands clasped over 
her bosom she fled wildly forward 
her foot became entangled in the car- 
pet she fell prostrate on the floor 

a gleam of malignant triumph shot 
from the preachers eyes 

 i have you at last he muttered 
as he knelt by her side his watery 
eyes grew expressive with a look of 
gloating admiration for a moment 
he gazed upon the girl in silence she 
lay prostrate upon the floor her form 
quivering with a slight convulsive 
motion while she gazed upon his face 
with her large black eyes dilating in 
an expression of utter horror 

 oh tremble trem-b e whis 
pered the good dr pyne it does 
me good to see you laying there help 



parson pyne has a good laugh to himself 



f ess as a baby you may cry for 
help no one will hear you you 
may attempt to escape but the doors 
are locked tremble oh trem-b e 

the girl shuddered as the full sense 
of her danger broke upon her clouded 
reason still she lay prostrate on the 
floor her face pale as death while 
she gazed upon the parson in help- 
less terror 

 save me mother oh save me 
she muttered in a low whisper as if 
talking to a spirit 

 your mother can t save you now 
you must come to your pa-pa my 
love he bent down and gathered 
her form in his arms 

 save me mother shrieked ma 
bel oh save me mother 

 you are mine you are be 
gan the parson in tones of exultation 
when his arms suddenly relaxed their 
hold and his fat form rolled senseless 
on the floor 

- gt g-a- you called yer mother and 
that call saved ye said a rough 
voice mabel looked up and shrieked 
devil-bug in all his hideous deformity 
stood at her side his face was con 
vulsed with an expression of fearful 
toatred and his long talonlike fingers 
worked as with an epileptic spasm 

 here glow-worm here muske- 
ter he shouted drag this old por- 
pis into the next room 

the negroes came stealing through 
the small doorway of the apartment 
they seized the unconscious form of 
the reverend pyne and bore him into 
the ante-chamber devil-bug was 
alone with the fair girl 

he stooped slowly down while she 

huddered in horror at the sight of his 

hideous visage he gathered his rough 



arms around her tender form hq 
raised her from the floor she shriek- 
ed with affright devil-bug uembled 
from head to foot stepping softly 
over the floor he bore her to the bed 
and laid her gently on its coverlid 
mabel s dark eyes grew lustrous with 
terror 

devil-bug stepped backward from 
the bed he gazed upon her face for 
a moment in silence his huge mouth 
was fixedly compressed and his large 
nostrils quivered with a nervous move 
ment his solitary eye glared upon 
the face of the girl with a fearful inten 
sity she was thrilled to the very 
heart with a strange awe 

a wild cry burst from his lips it 
was like the howl of an enraged beast 
holding the hunters at bay again 
that cry he rushed fiercely toward 
the bed mabel started up in involun 
tary affright devil-bug struck his 
huge hands violently against his fore 
head and uttered that terrific howl 
yet again then turning on his heel 
he fled madly from the room 



chapter tenth 

parson pyne has a good laugh to 
himself 

the portly form of parson pyne 
lay on the carpet of the ante-chamber 
with a huge negro watching on either 
side 

devil -bug rushed madly into the 
apartment and stood beside the form 
of the unconscious preacher his 
solitary eye glared with all the malig 
nity of a devil as its glance rested 



 



mabel 



upon the round and rubicund face of 
the parson 

 here yo niggers he shouted 
u d ye see that couch strip off the

the fat form of the parson was ex 
tended on the sacking bottom with 
each leg tightly pinioned by the ancle 
to the bed -posts at the foot while his 
extended hands were tied in the same 
manner to the posts at the head of 
the couch he certainly looked like 
a very corpulent representative of st 
andrew s cross his round paunch 
stood out from the sacking bottom in 
painful prominence and his large lips 
hanging apart afforded an interesting 
anatomical view of his mouth and 
pallet 

 is the poker and the tongs heated 
to a white heat grunted devil-bug 
scowling fiercely in the faces of his 
negroes 

 yes massa cried glow-worm 
as he raised the tongs in the light 
with its point heated to a glaring white 
heat 

 dis do massa cried musquito 
producing the poker whose jabbed 
point also heated to a white heat 
emitted a fierce and blinding glare

faintly as he unclosed his eyes

devil-bug and the two negroes hold

solitary eye flashing with concentrated 
hate 

parson pyne was silent for a mo 
ment he looked at the huge negroes 
by the bedside and a cold shudder rai 
over his fat person 

what are your questions he 
faintly asked

darter exclaimed devil-bug bending 
his head down to receive the answer

a firm tone

with a violent struggle to extricate 
himself from his uneasy position 
 you shall dearly pay for this inso 
lence

 werry likely responded devil- 
bug but for the present we ll at 
tend to business 

as he spoke glow-worm flung the 
shoes and stockings of the parson on 
the floor and his bare feet with the 
toes thrust upward were exposed to 
the light 

 tighten them cords round the 
ancles muttered devil-bug now 
parson for the last time will yo 
answer all my questions in regard to 
that darter o yours and ricollec 
parson yer not among the patent- 
gospel fellers now 

pyne made no answer but gazed 
in the face of devil-bug with his 
watery eyes distended by an expres 
sion of utter amazement

devil-bug as he took the heated poker 
from musquito s hands now par 
son vich eye do yo valley most

within an inch of the parson s right

pang through his very brain take 
care take care you ll burn out my

like the white heat of the iron

in a half-in-inch of the preacher s

parson pyne glanced cautions 
aside he beheld the negroes in the 
act of plunging the hot irons into a 
bucket of water the hissing sound 
emitted by the irons as they sank be 
neath the water broke like the voice of 
a friend on his ears 

 go to the devil he shouted in 
a tone of husky rage you may 
kill me but i will not answer youi 
questions

claimed devil-bug as his habitual 
grin distorted his features what 
ill yo bet parson that you don t an

spoke he walked round to the foot of 
the bed and extended his large hands 
until the talon fingers almost touched 
thb soles of the parson s feet 

 monster you shall pay for this 
cried the reverend pyne as his fat 
face was distended by an expression 
of surprise he evidently gazed upon 
the movements of devil-bug with 
some considerable wonder

preacher s agony 

wriggling and twisting along the 
bed parson pyne made the most 
superhuman efforts to extricate him 
self but in vain still the finger tips 
of devil-bug ran softly oh how softly 
along his feet still he was forced to 
rend the air with unwilling laughter

head and then the white foam frothed 
around his lips

exclaimed devil-bug walking round 
the foot of the bed now will you 
answer them questi ns 

parson pyne lay silent and speech 
less poor fellow he looked quite 
pitltful he lay gasping and panting 
fo- breath while his livid cheeks and 
starting eyes bore traces of the awful 
agony which he had endured had 
devil-bug continued his musical ex 
periments a moment longer the pa 
tent-gospellers would have lost their 
preacher and the devil gained a soul 
as he lay there pinioned to the bed 
nis starting eyes glaring vacantly 
nround the room he looked for all the 
world like a man who has been pre- 



ci ited over some awful heihth 
he lay so silent so motionless so ut 
terly blank and speechless had the 
pope of pagan rome have seen his 
foe he would have pitied him ever 
the four-and-twenty cardinals would 
have wept the vatican itself that 
deplorable edifice would have shed 
tears st peter s church that object 
of patent-gospel hate and scorn would 
have been convulsed with pity alas 
for the foe of pagan rome to 
think that he the daring and high- 
souled pyne who had stood up so 
often in his pulpit arid defied the pope 
and the devil who had electrified the 
old women with his eloquence and 
convulsed whole churches-full of gos 
pellers with his matchless zeal to 
think that he should have been tick 
led into submission 

for ten long and weary minutes 
devil-bug awaited the recovery of the 
parson never was whipped dog 
more completely cowed by the lash 
than was parson pyne by the finger 
tips of old devil-bug 

 was you dick baltzar or was 
you not answer old porpis 

 i was faintly responded the 
parson 

 you rented rooms at the house o 
th widder crank on christmas eve 
eighteen hundred an twenty-five 

 i did 

 the widder crank had a darter t 

she had 

 her name was 

 ellen faintly chirped parson 
pyne i ll tell you all about her 
she had been seduced two years be 
fore i came to the widow crank s 
house her seducer was a young - 
merchant named livingstone on 



 



mabel 



chrisl-nas eve eighteen hundred and 
twenty four she gave birth to a female 
child it was called ellen a few 
days after the child was born her mo 
ther in a fit of rage drove her from the 
house the child remained with the 
widow crank it seems that ellen 
and livingstone had quarrelled soon 
after the birth of the child and the 
mother s harshness resulted from her 
daughter s confession that she was 
not married to her lover for one 
year no intelligence whatever was 
heard from the daughter 

 ha shrieked devil-bug are 
yo sure o that 

 why as myself and wife only 
came to the widow s house a year 
after ellen had disappeared it s hard 
for me to tell murmured the rev 
dr pyne i never yet have been 
quite certain but that livingstone 
knew of the girl s whereabouts all the 
while 

devil-bug smiled grimly to himself 

ho ho he muttered then 
i m the only human bein as knows 
where ellen was during her absence 
from her mother s home 

 as i said before i came to the 
widow crank s house on christmas 
eve eighteen hundred and twenty 
five that very night ellen crank 
returned home she was in a very 
sad condition you see and her mother 
welcomed her back with tears of joy 
that very night she gave birth to 
another child 

devil -bug leaned slowly forward 
and applied his mouth to the ear of 
the parson and that ere lost child 
died he muttered in a whisper 
that thrilled the parson to the heart 



 livingstone always thought so 
said dr pyne in an evasive tone 

 no lyin parson one child 
died that night i know was it the 
first or second 

 it was the first answered dr 
pyne 

devil-bug buried his face in his 
hands and the parson heard him 
groan the negroes looked on in 
mute astonishment their master af 
fected by any thing like a human feel 
ing ha ha the thought tickled 
them and they chuckled quietly to 
gether 

 and the second child parson 
what ever becom of it said devil- 
bug looking at the preacher through 
the outspread fingers of his hands 

 i don t know answered pyne in 
a faint voice 

you lie shrieked devil-bug 
 you lie you stole that child par 
son you and your wife trained it up 
with the idea-r of havin a hold on 
livingstone when he came into his 
father s property don t i know ye 
ye fat dog he rose from his seat 
and seized the parson fiercely by the 
throat yer wife died and you 
turned parson h ho am i right 
tell me quick or i ll choke ye 

 you are you are cried pyne 
as he felt the talon-fingers of the de 
formed wretch gathering round his 
throat 

devil-bug started up with a wild 
howl and rushed madly into the 
chamber 



the savage alone with the maiden 



sol 



chapter eleventh 



thb savage alone with the 
maiden 

his teeth grating together and his 
bands outspread while his eye blazed 
with a madman s glare he rushed 
toward the bed whereon the girl was 
sleeping mabel started up in affright 
and clasped her hands over her bo 
som as she beheld him approach 

 oh save me now my god she 
shrieked and held her breath in very 
terror 

 come g-a- come cried devil- 
bug as gathering his arm around her 
waist he bore her quickly along the 
room come i say come 

he stopped before an antique mir 
ror of circular shape which depended 
from the wainscotted walls he placed 
mabel on her feet and rushing from 
her side seized the light from the 
small table near the fire in a mo 
ment he stood by her side again and 
as she started backward in utter hor 
ror of his hideous countenance he 
flung the matted hair aside from his 
right temple 

 look gal look he cried point 
ing to the reflection of his loathsome 
countenance in the mirror d ye 
see that red mark along my right tem 
ple that red mark like a snake 
d ye see it d ye see it that mark 
was born with me 

mabel gazed upon him with an ex 
pression of blank wonder mingled 
with terror 

devil-bug wound his rough arm 
round her neck and swept her thick 
black tresses aside from her right 
temple 



 look look g-a- look he shriek- 
d as he pointed to the reflection of 
her beautiful countenance in the mir 
ror i don t want you to look at 
them black eyes which are like hers 
nor the lips nor the cheeks but the 
right temple g-a- the right temple 

mabel involuntarily gazed within 
the mirror she started back with a 
strange feeling of surprise as she be 
held a slight thin and discolored 
streak marring the beauty of her 
face near the right temple it was a 
faint and delicate copy of the deep red 
mark near the swarthy temple of 
devil-bug 

that was born with you g-a-l 
that was born with you g-a- shout- 
ted devil-bug an you re my 
yes yes you re my 

he paused suddenly and fell on his 
knees he placed the light on a chair 
and then looked up into her wondering 
face with his hideous countenance 
distorted by a strange emotion 

then bending to the very floor he 
clung with his huge hands to the skirt 
of her white dress and impressed his 
thick jips upon the shoe of her tiny 
foot then big tears stole from the 
lids of his blazing eye and from the 
shrivelled socket which was destitute 
of an eyeball then his lips became 
fixedly compressed and as he raised 
his clenched hands he uttered a yell 
like the howl of an enraged hyena 

 oh mercy mercy shrieked 
mabel gazing upon the monster at 
her feet in utter alarm 

devil-bug seized her fair white 
hands and looked up into her face in 
silence it was a strange and fearful 
picture the savage kneeling at the 
feet of i ftnocence 



 



mabel 



her form so delicate and beautiful 
in all its rounded proportions of 
maidenly loveliness with the young 
bosom bared to the light and heaving 
with animation her face so pale and 
yet so fair to look upon with the dark 
eyes of such unutterable eloquence 
and the long black hair falling along 
the cheeks and down to the shoulders 

his form so rough and so uncouth 
with its harsh outlines of deformity 
and strength its broad chest quivering 
with strange emotion his face so 
dark so swarthy and so distorted 
with its protuberant brow its flat nose 
and wide mouth its eyeless socket and 
its solitary eye blazing with super 
human emotion it was a strange 
contrast the savage reared in the 
very centre of quaker city civiliza 
tion kneeling at the fair and beautiful 
woman wronged and injured by one 
f the professed ministers of that 
civilization 

 do not do not harm me cried 
mabel all other feelings absorbed by 
ihe terror which she felt for the strange 
being at her feet 

harm ye growled devil-bug 
as he rose from his kneeling position 
and forced her gently into a chair 
 gal who is it that talks to me of 
harmin ye 

he seated himself on a chair oppo 
site the maiden the light standing 
on another chair flashed its beams 
over the outlines of their faces so 
strangely contrasted to each other 

a wild hope fluttered over the heart 
of the maiden as she beheld some 
thing like human feeling in the soli 
tary eye of the monster 

 he may aid me to escape from 
this house she murmured 



 g-a- had ye ever a friend 
and as he spoke he took her fair white 
hand within his talon fingers 

 never answered mabel as her 
heart warmed with a strange sym 
pathy for the being before her my 
father has given me food and clothes 
and shelter but i never yet looked 
upon the face of a human being wnom 
i could call friend no mother ever 
smiled upon me and as for my father 
oh for god s sake do not do not 
place me in his power again 
 the g-a-l s been edicated mut 
tered devil-bug you never had a 
friend then you don t remember

 yes gal me i m ugly as the 
devil i know it but for you gal 
for you my heart feels warm ask 
me to hold my hand in that fire for 
your sake jist ask me 

he reached forth his hand toward 
the light as if to carry his words into 
action when a spot of thick red blood 
crusting the swarthy skin attracted 
the gaze of his solitary eye 

 ha it is her blood he shouted 
starting from his seat the old 
woman s blood the blood of ellen s 
mother ha there she lays with 
the red blood droppin from her hoi lei 
skull there there he pointed 



the flight from monk-hall 



fiercely to a vacant spot of the room 
don t ye see her gal and here 
gal here by my side his jaw back 
and his tongue stickin out he lays 
he jist as he fell through the trap 

he rushed wildly toward the door 
as the terrible phantoms in all their 
horror broke anew upon his gaze 
-but i ll beyer friend gal he 
shouted turning suddenly round i

where parson pyne still lay pinioned 
to the sacking bottom of the bed the 
herculean negroes watched by the 
bedside

and as he went down to the vault 
of monk-hall his wild and discordant 
laughter broke upon the air with a 
sound of strange and savage joy 



chapter twelfth 

the flight from monk-hall 

the negroes were alone in the 
ante-chamber glow-worm stood on 
one side of the fire gazing into the 
face of his comrade who leaned 
against the mantel on the opposite 
side musquito grinned hideously as 
he caught the gleam of glow-worm s 
eye

and the delightful gentlemen chuck

the walls of the chamber echoed with 
their uproarious glee 

the door leading into the hall of 
the second story opened suddenly 
and long-haired bess entered the 
chamber her large dark eyes flash 
ed with a clear and brilliant expres 
sion and her jet-black hair streaming 
wildly over her shoulders gave a 
strange relief to her deathly counte 
nance 

 de lor jimminy it am de gal 
muttered musquito with an expression 
of idiotic surprise 

 quick i say quick exclaimed 
bess approaching the fire-place i 
want the keys of the house old 
devil-bug is waitin for em where 
are they quick i say 

 dere dey are missus exclaim- 
d glow-worm with a mock bow as 
he pointed to the bunch of keys rest 
ing on the small table near the light 
what de debbil yo want em foh 

bess seized the keys and rushed 
into the adjoining chamber where ma 
bel was imprisoned 

 i say nigga what all dis mean 
exclaimed glow-worm gazing in 
musquito s face 

 i spect dar s some fuss down 
sta rs responded the other negro 

as he spoke bess re-entered the 
room with the form of mabel sup 
ported by the embrace of her right 
arm while the pale face of the young 
girl lit by her large and lustrious 
eyes of midnight blackness wore an 
absent and bewildered expression 

 come this way this way whis 
pered bess moving toward the door 
which led out into the hall this 
way and you shall be saved 

 what foh vou do dat foh mut 



tered glow-worm hercely as he 
turned toward long-haired bess with 
a threatening look 

 hush h-u-s-h whispered bess 
as she glanced meaningly at the half- 
conscious face of the girl who hung 
on her arm you see glow-worm 
there s a rumpus kicked up down 
stairs and devil-bug wants to have 
the gal removed to the tower room 
open the door quick and let me hurrj 
up stairs with her you are so stupid 
glow-worm quick i say 

the look which animated the face 
of long-haired bess dispelled all the 
doubts which the negro had entertain 
ed with a mechanical gesture h 
flung open the door 

 now glow-worm close it aftei 
me she said gazing in his hideous 
face while her tone was that of a con 
fidential whisper and if anybody 
should come up here and ask after 
the gal you must swear that she was 
never in the house 

 yes missus 

 ha ha ha we know how to 
manage these things don t we glow- 
worm laughed bess as standing in 
the doorway she gathered her arm 
more closely around the waist of the 
girl who lay half-fainting in her em 
brace it takes us don t it mus 
quito 

 it jist does dat chuckled the 
negro and glow-worm joining in his 
laugh carefully closed the door 

bess stood in the darkness of the 
hall a smile of triumph flashed over 
her proud face she felt the heart of 
the girl throbbing against the hand 
that held her form to her side 

the plot of the parson and nia 
tool shall be scattered to the winds 



the fliht from monk-hall 



 



 will save the wronged girl save her 
from the hands of her priestly father 
this way fair girl and we will escape 
together 

 whither are you leading me 
murm jred mabel in a bewildered tone 
 oh save me from my father do 
with me what you will but do not hurry 
me to his roof again i will work my 
fingers to the bone beg in the streets 
or starve but oh do not place me 
in his power again 

bess silently led the way down the 
stairs crouching on the steps about 
half-way down was the form of a 
woman attired in floating robes of 
white 

 mary arise we will escape ex 
claimed bess in a whisper take 
my arm and cling to me with all your 
strength we will escape from monk- 
hall 

the fair girl rose in the darkness 
and clung to the arm of the fallen 
woman no word escaped her lips 
no sigh heaved her bosom she was 
silent as the grave 

 ha i hear the sound of his foot 
steps on the lower stairs muttered 
bess he is ascending from the 
vault of monk-hall now help me 
heaven if he bears a light with him 
we are lost another moment and all 
will be discovered 

she pressed her hand madly to her 
forehead but in a moment an exclama 
tion of joy burst from her lips 

 stand close against the wall on 
this side of the stairway i will ove 
your form with this cloak 

they crouched against the wall a 
the sound of devil-bug s footsteps were 
heard on the floor of the hall below 
seizing the cloak which she had lei 



vith mary while leading mabel from 
he chamber above she flung it over 
heir figures and stood erect against 
ts folds her dark dress shrouding 
ler form from view the sound of 
devil-bug s footsteps were heard on the 
irst step of the stair-case there was 
gtarely room for him to pass between 
he form of bess and the banisters op- 
gtosite he ascended the stairs step 
y step he ascended his hard breath- 
ng breaking on the still air like the 
gtanting of a wild beast about to spring 
at the traveller s throat in the darkness 
f some hideous ravine the heart of 
ess fluttered in her throat another 
tep and he would be at her side she 
leld her breath his foot was on the 
step where she stood shielding the 
brms of the girls from view the 
ight from the distant roof fell dimly 
over his hideous face and form while 
he side of the stair-way next to the 
wall was enveloped in thick darkness 
bess beheld him turn his coarse gar 
ments rustled against her dress she 
placed her hand against her mouth to 
smother the shriek which arose to her 
ips the solitary eye of devil-bug 
deered into the darkness with a fixed 
glare bess silently grasped the mas 
sive key of the front door in her right 
hand and separated it from the ring 
which confined the bunch of keys in 
the action the keys jingled together 
devil-bug started bess raised the 
massive key in her hand it was her 
determination to crush his skull with 
its weight if he laid his hand upon her 
her lips were compressed and he 
bosom for the moment was motionless 
as marble 

 my heart s full of all sorts o queer 
tantrums muttered devil-bug t i 



 



mabel 



just now thought i heered some 
body breathin on the stairs and 
now i thought i heered my keys a 
jinglin together wot a rediculus 
fool i am to be sure 

he pursued his way he passed the 
form of bess and the sound of his 
footsteps presently echoed from the 
stairs above 

bess breathed freely again a wild 
feeling of joy fluttered round her heart 
she seized the trembling girls one in 
each arm nerved for the effort by a 
hallowed hope that now began to 
brighten over her soul she gathered a 
fair form in each arm and hurried 
down the stairs 

 the key the key she shouted 
in a wild delirium of joy a moment 
longer and we are saved a moment 
and we escape from monk-hall 

meanwhile devil-bug ascending the 
stairs stood before the door of monk 
baltzar s ante-chamber 

 i ll see the gal once agin he 
muttered i ll look on her purty 
face agin she shall roll in gold she 
jhall old devil-bug s darter shall 
avc the money ha ha ha sich 
lots o money 

he entered the ante-chamber and 
passed along without heeding glow 
worm and musqueto who stood by the 
fire gently unclosing the door of the 
next apartment he stepped within the 
chamber where he had left the girl 
he closed the door and advanced 
toward the light 

 she s a-sleepin on that bed the 
darter of ellen he muttered folding 
his arms many and many s the 
night i ve laid at ellen s door watchin 
her while she slept and keepin her 
from harm there was nt never a 



human bein as did nt cuss me except 
one except one that was her 
ellen the gal whom i d ave died for 
and this is her darter ha ha ha 
and she shall ride in her carriage and 
have goold pieces thick as flies in a 
molasses jug 

he advanced a step nearer to the 
bed his head inclined to one side as 
if in the act of listening he listened 
for the low soft sound of a woman 
breathing in her sleep 

 she sleeps wery softly muttered 
devil-bug an i ll go to living 
stone an i ll tell him the story and 
i ll tear that parson s heart from his 
carcase if he dares say that she ain t 
the merchant s darter i hate and cuss 
the whole world the whole world hates 
and cusses me but the g-a-l i ll 
skulk along the street and see her 
ridin in her carriage i ll watch in the 
cold winter nights and see her all 
shinin with goold and jewels as she 
goes into the theatre with the big 
folks round her and the rich mer 
chant by her side f 

he drew a step nearer the bed 

 and then i ll skulk down into the 
pit and hide my head but keep a look 
out on her with my one eye when i 
sees the folks makin much of her the 
jewels shinin on her dress the brace 
lets round her wrists and the goold 
band around her white brow then i ll 
stick my face in my hands an laff 
ho ho ho there i ll cry to my 
selfthere is old devil-bug s darter 
among the grandees o the quaker 
city 

he drooped his head on his breast 
while his eye blazed and his thick 
lips parted in a grotesque grin 

in a moment however a strange 






the flight from monk-hall 






mood of thought seemed to pass over 
the distorted intellect of this monster 

he stood with his head drooped low 
on his wide chest while his hands 
hung extended by his side hb soli 
tary eye which contracted and dilated 
ike the eye of a tiger grew large and 
lustrous his teeth were clenched 
while bis thick hds receded in a con 
vulsive grimace he stood motionless 
as the aged walls of that old house 
of whose wide rooms and dreary 
vaults he seemed the living soul 

in that moment of silence what a 
world of thought passed over the soul 
of the monster 

first came a vision of the fair wo 
man who had loved him loved the 
outcast of mankind the devil in human 
shape could you have seen devil- 
bug s soul at the moment it was agi 
tated by this memory you wouid 
have started at the contrast which it 
presented in comparison with his de 
formed body for a moment the soul 
of devil-bug was beautiful 

then the scorn of the world crowd 
ed upon his soul his ignominious 
birth his lonely life the hatred was 
felt for him and the loathing which 
he felt for man his distorted face and 
deformed body like a black cloud 
it gathered upon him had devil- 
bug s soul assumed a tangible shape 
his body in comparison would have 
grown beautiful it was terrible to 
note the malice of his soul flashing 
from his eye and trembling on his 

hp 

then came one wild and wandering 
thought it darted over the chaos of 
his mind like the long and trembling 
ray of a star that shines but for an in 
stant and then is dark forever it was 
 



aij 



a thought brief it is true wild 
wandering yet mighty in its vry 
brevity of existence and most glorious 
in its wandering shape it was a 
thought of god devil-bug for a rrjo- 
ment felt the existence of a god for 
a moment he felt that he had a fathpr 
in the universe he imagined n 
awful being with a face of unutterable 
beauty an awful being looking fortfi 
from a vast immensity of clouds and 
darkness while a frown broke ove 
his eternal brow devil-bug felt thalj 
this being was his father he feltj 
that he devil-bug the outcast of earth 
the incarnate outlaw of hell had one 
friend in the wide universe that friend 
his creator he felt in every fibre 
of his deformed soul that the eyes of 
the awful being were fixed upon him 
in terrible reproof yet with a gleam 
of mercy breaking from their eternal 
lustre 

this thought was but for a moment 
like a flash of light it came like a 
shadow it passed away 

then slowly and terribly thore 
came gliding to his side the phantoms 
of the murdered man and woman 
the man with the body distorted by 
death the knees drawn up to the chest 
the jaw broken and the tongue lolling 
out the woman with the blood oozing 
drop by drop from the hollow skull 
while the fragment of the face clung 
by the quivering neck to the shattered 
and mangled body devil-bug could 
see the old woman s flesh quiver he 
could hear the sound of the dropping 

drop 
drop 



blood drop then a pause 
another pause drop drop 



how red it grows as it curdles over 
the hard bricks of the fire plac he 
could see the blood-shot eyes ol the 



mabel 



man moving slowly to and fro ihen 
the tongue blackened and then ugh 
that low-toned yet terrible moan 

 they are with me muttered 
devil-bug wiping the cold sweat from 
his brow with me forever but 
i don t see that man haiwey i don t 
see his corpse ugh there he is 
now layin beside the grave his body 
straightened out and his eyes glaring 
upward like bits of glass in the sun 
shine he moves ugh he rises 
or bis feet he makes toward me 
ugh back i say you re dead yo 
devil and yo can t frighten me 

this was uttered in a low whisper 
that would have thrilled a man s blood 
to hear his right arm extended 
while the cold sweat trickled from his 
brow devil-bug stood immoveable as 
a rock while he regarded the phantom 
with a fixed and glassy eye 

 back yo devil you re dead 
ugh back i say yo can t frighten 
me 

in a moment the fit subsided and 
devil-bug gazed around with a wild 
shriek of laughter 

them things iswerry delightful 
he observed with his usual grin 
 they quite refreshes a feller 

he approached the bed and his 
mood changed his child lay sleep 
ing there his child the darkness 
which shrouded the corners of the 
chamber lay thick around her couch 
but she was there his heart beat 
with a strange feeling of joy as he 
approached the bedside and from his 
heart through every vein that strange 
joy darted like lightning 

he extended his hand he passed it 
over the bed-clothes a shudder ran 
tver his framt again he extended 



his hand again passed it nervously 
over the white coverlid he started 
backward with a cry of horror 

he stood for a moment silent and 
immoveable then running from one 
corner of the room to another he 
shrieked the name of ellen again and 
yet again while the muscles of his 
face worked as with a death-spasm 

 ellen he shrieked in his frenzy 
confounding the mother with the child 
 where have they tuk yo ellen- 
did i not watch yo in the winter 
nights did i not fight for yo say 
nell was there ever sich a sarvant as 
old devil-bug nell nell answer 
me nelly don t play possum with 
devil-bug i know you re hid some 
where i know it you d not leave 
me nell 

again he shrieked that name he 
listened for a moment no answer 
came to his call he rushed hurriedly 
into the ante-chamber he seized the 
negro musquito by the throat with a 
giant s grasp 

 tell me yo scoundrel where 
did yo take that gal 

 massa replied the negro speak 
ing with difficulty as the talon fingers 
encircled his throat missus bess 
took de keys and de gal dat s 
all massa 

 nigger i ll have you roasted 
alive shrieked devil-bug with an 
ominous scowl of anger bess took 
the gal and the keys did she nig 
gers i ll tell you what it is if that 
gal escapes i ll have your black flesh 
torn off with hot pincers i ll 

he rushed through the doorway 
and was heard descending the stairs 

meanwhile with the fair form of a 



the flight fb 



monk-hall 



 






irembling woman on each arm bess 
pursued her way down stairs and in 
a few moments stood at the small door 
df the doorkeeper s fireroom it hung 
slightly ajar bess gazed through the 
crevice and to her utter horror be 
held two persons standing near the 
fire she looked again and recog 
nized the portly form of the fat parson 
and the well-built figure of fitz- 
cowles they were chatting plea 
santly together 

 a fine girl you say parson ha 
ha you re a sly rogue you are 
where is she now 

 don t speak so loud fitz she s 
up stairs a lovely girl with a soft 
form and red lips ah 

bess could hear the parson smack 
his thick lips together with holy 
fervor 

 take care parson or i ll cut you 
out i ll buy off old devil-bug and 
have the beauty all to myself i 
f u iaow you preachers are awful sly 
with the women and the pulpit is 
rather celebrated for its taste in that 
ime my curiosity is excited parson 
i should like to see the girl 

 ah-ha should you i ve had 
a good deal of trouble in trapping the 
beauty she shan t pass out of my 
hands for nothing i assure you 

there was a pause for a few mi 
nutes fitz-cowles and the parson 
whispered together 

bess looked through the crevice 
while the girls hung trembling on her 
arms and beheld the good parson in 
the act of rattling a dice-box which 
devil -bug had left on the mantle 

ha ha the hundred dollars 
ire mine chuckled the parson 

bess beheld fitz-cowles take up the 



dice and rattling them for a moment 
in the box fling them out upon the 
surface of the mantlepiece 

 and the girl is mine exclaimed 
fitz-cowles with a look of triumph 
 our agreement was that the one who 
had the highest throw should take the 
money the other should have the 
woman being a parson you of 
course had more luck with the dice 
than one of the laity like myself i 
am content with the girl where is 
she 

 up stairs my room you know 
and the parson waved his hand to 
ward the door 

fitz-cowles moved from the fire 
place in a moment the door would be 
flung open and bess with her com 
panions be discovered 

 now is my time muttered bess 
 girls stay here for a single moment 
and i ll save you she placed them 
in the darkness one on either side of 
the doorway 

 the house is on fire she shriek 
ed as with her dark hair flung wild 
ly over her shoulders she rushed 
through the doorway and confront 
ed the astonished parson and the 
millionaire save yourselves while 
it is in your power the house is in 
flames away away 

she rushed toward the front door 
while they stood utterly confounded 
near the fireplace in a mcment the 
key was in the lock in another instant 
the door was flung wide open 

 save yourselves shouted bess 
elevating her voice to an unnatural 
pitch the house is on fire delay 
another moment and you are lost 

 shall we move fitz 

 i guess we d better parson 






 



mabel 






the words had scarcely passed his 
dps when the folds of white garments 
fluttered before his eyes and two fe 
male forms rushing from the doorway 
of the hall bounded along the floor 
with one convulsive spring like that 
of the doe when environed by hunters 
mabel herself all terror supported 
the quivering form of mary in an 
instant they passed the form of bess 
as with the key in her hand she held 
the front door wide open 

 now girls she shrieked cling 
to my arms and we may escape 

with a fair girl clinging to each 
arm she darted from the doorway 
and was lost to view 

 it s the very girl the one in the 
white dress its mabel exclaimed 
parson pyne 

 yes but there were two in white 
dresses interrupted fitz-cowles 

 the one with long dark hair and 
jet-black eyes that was mabel cried 
parson pyne moving toward the door 

 ha say you so i d peril a cool 
thousand to win her let s give chase 
that alarm of fire was all a sham 

they moved to the door and looked 
out upon the night at a short dis 
tance down the narrow street the white 
garments of mary and mabel waved 
in the light of the moon 

 i ll pursue them shouted fitz- 
cowles darting down the street 

and i ll run this way and head 
them off at the next street cried 
the parson moving briskly along the 
alley in an opposite direction ten 
chances to one they take the alley 
which winds round and round like a boa 
constrictor and at last strikes into the 
street about a hundred yards ahead 
ha ha i can walk quietly along and 



head them c f should dear little ma- 

bel get into my hand s again ah- 

ha 

the parson pursued his way alon 
the street chuckling gaily to him 
self and at the very moment that 
fitz-cowles pursued the wanderers in 
one direction while the parson endea 
voured to intercept them in another 
the form of devil-bug appeared in the 
broad door-way of monk-hall 

 ho ho he cried looking west- 
wardly down the narrow street there 
they go with a feller chasin em 
there s bess curse her there s lor- 
rimer s gal and there s nell ha they 
strike into the alley which instead of 
going straight ahead like a reglar 
phil delphy alley winds round the 
yard of monk-hall and comes into the 
street agin about a hundred yards 
ahead ho ho i have it i have it 
i ll just climb the fence of the yard and 
drop down into the alley back of monk- 
hall the gal s will come trampin 
down the alley for dear life they ll 
see a black lump on the ground they ll 
rush on thinkin it a stone but that 
black lump will rise on its feet and it 
will stretch out its arms and grasp em 
old devil-bug will have the child his 
darter agin 

he disappeared within the door of 
monk-hall 

lt the moon rose above the house 
tops monk-hall gleamed in the sil 
very light like a goblin mansion each 
peak of the roof each fantastic chim 
ney the massive tower and the front 
of black and red brick intermingled in 
strange contrast were disclosed by the 
light of the rising moon floating so 
soft and mellow from the expanse of 
the fathomless winter sky 



thl flight from monk-hall 



 



meanwhile along the narrow street 
each arm supporting the form of a half- 
ainting girl bes-s pursued her wa r 
her heart filled with one fixed pur 
pose and her very soul nerved for the 
effort the sound of footsteps struck 
upon her ear she turned her head 
over her shoulder and beheld fitz- 
cowles at the distance of some fifty 
yards his conical hat and gold- 
headed cane were directly perceptible 
in the moonlight but one course re 
mained for bess she must strike into 
the narrow alley or be overtaken 

gathering the arms of the girls more 
firmly within her own bess whispered 
a word of encouragement in their ears 
and darted around the three forms 
were lost to view in the winding alley 

r gad i ll have them yet shouted 
fitz-cowles gaining the corner of the 
alley and gazing intently upon the 
figures of the wanderers that face 
and those eyes are not so easily for 
gotten gad i ll have them yet 

bess turned her head over her 
shoulder she saw the pursuer gaining 
upon her at every step 

 on mary she whispered lt on 
mabel for by some strange means 
he had gained the name of the strange 
maiden you are running from 
death and worse than death 
 her words infused a new life into 
the heart of mabel poor mary too 
felt a strange energy darting through 
her veins 

not a word more was said but on 
and onward they dashed over the 
rough stones through the puddles of 
miry water beneath the shadow of the 
thickly clustered houses on and on 
ward race for maiden purity a 
race for womap s honor 



at every step fitz-cowles gained 
upon the wanderers his shout of 
laughing derision burst upon their ears 
the echo of his footsteps smote their 
hearts like a death-knell 

 ha ha p he laughed my black- 
eyed damsel i ll have you by jove 
i ll have you yet 

bess reached a point of the winding 
alley where the thickly-clustered 
houses were superseded on one side 
by a high board fence over the 
lence dark indistinct and gloomy was 
seen the roof of monk-hall with the 
tower rising in the moon-beams 

as bess reached the fence fitz- 
cowles was within ten paces of her 
side nothing could save her now 
panting for breath the girls clung 
tremblingly to her arms their weight 
began to drag her down her strength 
gave tokens of exhaustion 

fitz-cowles uttered a shout of tri 
umph and sprang forward to grasp his 
victim he did not heed the dark 
lump which like a blackened rock 
uprose from the very centre of the 
pathway the girls rushed past the 
blackened mass fitz-cowles sprang 
forward to grasp them laughing gaily 
in the action when a wild yell broke 
on the air mingling with his cheerful 
laugh the black mass at his feet as 
sumed the shape and form of the mon 
ster and devil-bug confronted the 
millionaire 

 ho ho my teller i ve got ygt 
have i he shrieked with a blazing 
eye what in the devil d ye mean 
by chasin that gal 

stand back or i ll cleave your 
skull with my cane stand back fel 
low you re in my pay and i ll 
tise you for this insolence 



 



mael 



and fitz-cowles brandished his 
gold-headed cane in the light of the 
moon you ll chastise me will ye 
shouted devil-bug there never 
yet was a man as felt the weight o 
this arm and lived afterwards 

he sprang upon fitz-cowles with a 
yell they clenched together they 
fell in the mire of the gutter and 
fought like dogs the savage and the 
millionaire 

onward with faint and weary steps 
the wanderers held their way they 
reached the termination of the winding 
alley where it emerged upon the nar 
row street a hundred yards distant 
from monk-hall panting for breath 
and trembling in every tired limb ma 
bel clung nervously to the arm of bess 

hile mary her senses whirling in 
strange confusion flung the weight 
of her quivering form full upon the 
shoulder of the dark-eyed woman 

 ha there is a man standing at 
the corner of the street we are watch 
ed bess exclaimed in a whisper 
 courage mabel courage mary you 
shall not be dragged to monk-hall 
again while bess has a firm soul or a 
resolute arm 

it is my father whispered mabel 
trembling in every limb 

 yes yes my pretty mabel it is 
your father cried the portly parson 
advancing from the shadows of the 
street come here with me and i ll 
overlook your recent misconduct come 
home my dear 

he approached the trembling girl 
she clung to the arm of bess with the 
energy of despair bess suddenly 
flung the maiden aside and raised her 
irm on high each sinew was braced 
for a desperate effort and the tiny fin 



gers of her hand grasped the massive 
key of monk-hall 

 oh do not cast me from you 
shrieked mabel 

 come to your pa-pa my dear 
exclaimed parson pyne reaching forth 
his hand to grasp the form of mabel 
 her eyes flashing fire bess sprang 
forward and struck the parson on the 
forehead with the massive iron key 
the blow was as sudden as it was un 
expected he reeled to one side and 
fell upon flie pavement like a dead 
man 

 now girls cling to my arms yet 
once again ere ar hour passes over 
my head i will placo you in a quie 
refuge where no wrong can assail 
you no dark passion mar your 
peace 

 any where bessie to the lowest 
hovel to the abode of rags and misery 
and want but for god s sake not to that 
home the home which i left only last 
night for the mansion of lorraine i 
have had my dream bessie god 
alone knows how terrible has been the 
awakening from that dream 

as mary spoke her voice grew 
tremulous and bess turned her face 
away from the gaze of the ruined girl 
that wan countenance those eyes of 
liquid blue dilating with a frenzied 
glare the vision blasted the very 
eyesight of long-haired bess 

mabel clung to the arm of the tall 
woman and in a whisper besought hei 
to fly from the spot 

 let us away she cried my 
father and she pointed to the portly 
form whjch cumbered the roadside 
 i fear him worse than the grave 

bess silently gathered the arms of 
each girl within her ownj and then at 






the flight from monk-hall 



 



fthe moon shone upon the wan yet 
beaming face with blue eyes and 
gol jen hair on one side and the pale 
countenance with dark eyes and mid 
night tresses on the other she raised 
her gaze to the moonlit heavens above 
and for the moment her dark orbs 
grew lustrous with a strange eloquence 
at that moment as standing at the 
corner of the gloomy street with a 
ruined girl on one side a wronged 
maiden on the other her face once so 
beautiful and now lovely to look upon 
in its very ruins was imbued with an 
expression holy as that which mantles 
over the face of the dying mother 
when blessing her first born child 
 up to the throne of the pure and 
f merciful god from the heart of the 
courtezan there ascended a vow a 
holy vow she was degraded steep 
ed to the very lips in pollution canker 
ed to the heart with loathsome vice 
yet at that moment she was a holy 
thing in the sight of the angels for 
before the altar of almighty god she 
swore to protect the ruined mary to 
the death she vowed to guard the 
stainless mabel from the shadow of a 
wrong and the vow went up to god 
and the moon rising higher over the 
roof-tops seemed to shed a more 

w kindly light as if to crown that vow 

with an omen of success 

 and the three sisters the fallen 
betrayed and the innocent wan 
dered forth a ong the streets on their 



 gloomy way 



the old state house 
clock one there is a wild music in 
the sound of that old bell it rings 
like the voice of a warning spirit 
when heard in the silence of night 



how many have heard it in the dead 
hour of night ere they laid down to 
die the suicide wan faced and heart 
broken has paused on the edge of the 
delaware as the sound of that bell 
has for a moment called him back 
to life the poor mechanic starving 
in his desolate home has raised his 
head for the last time as the old bell 
struck one upon his freezing ear and 
then moaned and clutched the air and 
died the bank director revelling 
at the sight of his gold won from the 
poor by fraud to which a pirate s 
crimes are acts of benevolence the 
jolly bank director counting over his 
sweat-wrung gold at the solemn hour 
of the night has been aroused from 
his reveries by that awful sound dim 
booming and knell -like the state 
house clock tolling one woman 
fair and young and beautiful sinking 
into the arms of shame has started 
from the polluted couch as that sound 
broke on her ears now fast-sealed to 
all the warnings of conscience she 
has started and thought of the voice 
of her grey-haired father she haa 
started and wept

the minister of justice bending 
over the table on whose surface the 
hard gold is flung ringing down by 
the hands of the wealthy citizen who 
sits smiling opposite the hard gold 
which buys the life of some wealthy 
murderer from the gallows or the

huzza for the old state house bell 
and above all other hours huzza for

two figures were slowly wending 
their way along a well-known street

 agreed now for another race 
a moment and we ll have them 

in the distance at the corner of the 
next street the while garments of ma 
bel and mary with the dark robes of 
bess fluttering between the two young 
forms waved for a moment in the 
moonlight in another moment the 
portly pyne and the well-formed mil 
lionaire gave chase in a moment the 
three women turned the corner of the 
next street it required but a few 
seconds for pyne and fitz-cowles to 
gain the corner of the street they 
looked up and down the street the 
women had disappeared the moon 
was shining brightly in the heavens 
and its beams illumined the long street 
which like all philadelphia streets was 
laid out with all the matter-of-fact 
straightness of a ten-pin alley 

 where could they have disap 
peared muttered pyne there is no 
alley between this street and the next 
and i see no signs of any other hiding 
place they must have gone into 
some o these houses 

 egad where will you find a house 
open at this hoar they must have 
sunk down plump into the bricks of 
the pavement 

 ha here is the widow smolby s 
house ten to one they went in this 
door wait a moment i ll knock 

accordingly the reverend doctor 
pyne knocked at the door of the widow 
smolby s ancient mansion in a few 
moments the door receded about the 
width cf an inch and the glare of a 
light flashed out upcn the side-walk 

 is the widow smolby in asked 
the pious dr pyne assuming his bland 
est tone 



hat answer answered a rough 
voice from the crevice of the door 
 her corpse 

 i spose you don t know that the 
widder was took bad with an attack of 
murder and thieves this arternoon t 
the crowner sot upon her which con- 
siderin as he s a wery fat man was 
rayther an ungenteel thing for him to 
do 

 you did not see any thing of three 
young ladies in these parts did you 
asked the zealous dr pyne in hi-s 
most unctuous voice 

 now wot a precious question that 
is to wake a man up in the middle o 
th night for make a pin-cushion of 
me somebody and hang me up agin 
the wall for all the old ladies to stick 
pins in but if i ain t got a notion to 
come out there old porpis 

with these words the gentleman on 
the inside being in somewhat of an 
angry mood violently closed the door 
using a familiar synonym for condem 
nation with some considerable empha 
sis 

 how much his voice sounds like 
that of major mulhill muttered fitz 
cowles 

 the gal is in this house i ve not 
a doubt of it blandly remarked thx 
foe of pagan rome 

i ll tell you what it is monk baltzar 
i feel interested in this girl her dark 
eyes have made a decided impression

that i did not win and so if you ll by

small spite against this girl and by to 
morrow at noon this petticoat shall be 
in your power by-the-bye what s 
that object m the gutter yonder 

 nothing but a drunken man 
come parson let s stroll down the 
street and arrange matters 

and as they strolled clown the street 
talking earnestly together the dark 
object in the gutter moved to and fro 
and in a moment it resolved itself into 
the outlines of a man s figure the 
moon shone over a wan and ghastly 
face with glassy eyes glaring fixedly 
on the blue heavens above around 
that face fell thick locks of jet black 
hair all matted with the mire of the 
gutter and soiled with the dust of the 
street and the man crawled slowly 
along the hard stones of the street and 
then as if unable to move from weak 
ness he raised his face faintly in the 
light of the moon and looked upon the 
heavens and uttered a low cry then 
his head dropped upon the stones of 
the street and he lay like a dead man 

the heart of bess thrilled with des 
pair when after all her wanderings 
nil her efforts to escape from monk- 
hall she heard the triumphant cry 
of the parson and the millionaire as 
they again pursued her 

dragging the exhausted girls with 
her she rushed forward but the 
strength of the three soon failed and 
she was about to sink down with des 
pair when mabel uttered an exclama 
tion of surprise 

 this is the widow smolby s house 
from which my father dragged me 
twelve hours ago exlaimed mabel 
as she beheld the gloomy walls of the 
old house rising in the moonbeams 



 the widow smolby muttered 
bess as though some strange memory 
had flashed over her brain ha 
we may obtain shelter here i ll 
make the attempt at all events 

she knocked at the door it re 
ceded slightly and a rough voice from 
within demanded her errand 

 ha larkspur she exclaimed 
 is that you long-haired bess 
asks you to give her shelter for the 
night she has some important facts 
to disclose with regard to the late 
murder 

 why bess my duck is that 
you cried easy larkspur opening 
the door two young ladies with 
you oh ho up to some new caper 
i spose come in my dear 

for the first time a wild suspicion 
darted over the brain of mary arling 
tion that bess was a courtezan that 
she had been betrayed through hei 
means that thought so wild and 
vague and yet so terrible smote poor 
mary to the soul the familiar man 
ner with which a rough looking gen 
tleman like easy larkspur greeted 
bessie first aroused this suspicion in 
the mind of mary 

 walk in ladies walk in you 
see i was jist enjoyin a glass of 
whiskey punch by the fire with a 
prime hawanner and whiskey 
punch ladies as you may have had 
occasion to know is a werry good

opinion is the most despisable thing 
as is 

 laikspur i have one word to say 
lo you from an accomplice of the 
murderer i have gained some know 
ledge of the murder committed in this 
house yesterday afternoon this 
knowledge i will place in your keep 
ing on one consideration give these 
ladies and myself shelter for the 
night this is all i ask of you 

 why you see bessie i was ap- 
p inted after the crowner s inquest had 
sot upon the old lady to stay here all 
night in case the thieves might take a 
notion to repeat their wisit my fel 
lers is a-sleepin in the back room 
you wouldn t like to try a leetle of 
this punch would yo you may 
stay here all night no doubt o that 
but as all the other rooms was locked 
up by the ma or you ll have to sleep 
in the room where the corpse is 

 oh heaven whispered mabel 
is the old lady dead and her 
dark eyes grew lustrous with fear and

 dead my darlin as the nited 
states bank observed larkspur 
with whiskey punch beaming from 
every line of his face and a deader 
thing than that i don t know it s 
about the deadest thing as is that s a 
fact 

bess silently led the girls up stairs 
the same shudder thrilled through 
every heart as they entered the ghost- 
chamber two formal wax candles 
gave a dim light to the place the 
massive bed with its thick curtains 
still stood in one corner the high- 
backed chairs had been replaced in 
their positions against the wall the 
mir or between the windows still 



flashed oack the light of the candles 
the room was the same as in rh 
morning the furniture still wore the 
same antique and ghostly air and the 
portrait above the mantel still gazed 
around the place with its pale and 
beautiful countenance relieved by 
sweeping tresses of long black bair 
and enlivened by the gleam of lustrous 
dark eyes 

the ghost-room was the same 
and yet not altogether the same 
there was a crust of hardened blood 
congealed along the cold bricks of the 
fireplace the very air seemed tainted 
with the smell of human blood shed 
in violence and murder 

in the centre of the chamber in the 
full glare of the light rested a coffin 
covered with a plain cloth and placed 
upon tressels of sabel wood the 
glare of the light flashed over the de 
tails of the cold white shroud the stiff 
hands carefully crossed over each 
other the feet thrusting the death robe 
slightly upward all were painfully 
disclosed but the face was covered 
with a loose piece of snowy linen 
mangled and shattered and crushed 
it was too fearful a sight for the eyes 
of the living to behold and yet was it 
not tenfold more horrible to see thai 
white cloth thrown over the face leav 
ing the vivid fancy to depict the loath 
some reality than to look upon the 
palpable reality itself to fancy thn 
cold blood falling drop by drop upor 
the bottom of the coffin from the hoi 
low skull 

there she lay her gold forgotten 
her blood cold and icy her limbs 
stiffened as marble and as the hgbl 
flickered with an uncertain glare ind 
as the wind moaned tsrc g gt

crevices of the chamber and as the 
hangings of tho bed and the windows 
rustled heavily to and fro while from 
the frame of the portrait the face of 
a beautiful woman gazed sadly upon 
the scene it seemed as though an 
awful and invisible fiend had infected 
the very air with a curse that fiend 
was murder in the rustling curtains 
in the moaning wind in the flickering 
light in the sad gaze of the portrait 
in the spectacle of the coffin and the 
corse in all these he spoke with a 
voice that froze the blood in its career 
and stilled the heart in its beatings 

 behold your mother cried bess 
in a tone of wild agitation as seizing 
mabel by the hand she pointed to the 
portrait behold your mother you 
are the child of livingstone the mer 
chant this house and all its contents 
are yours yours by the will of yon 
murdered woman who rests cold and 
icy in her coffin behold the face of 
your mother gazing upon you in 
kindness and love kneel mabel 
kneel and thank your god that after 
the long night which has darkened 
your life the day has dawned at 
last 

and while mabel stood stricken 
dumb with astonishment while her 
brain whirled in wild confusion and 
the very room seemed to reel around 
her bess turned aside and took mary 
by the hand 

 now hear the dark confession 
svhich i have to whisper to your ear 
ehe shrieked falling on her knees 
 i was the cause of your ruin i was 
the accomplice of the seducer i took 
his wages and earned them by selling 
myself body and soul into his hands 
i it was that lured you from your 



home i it was that led you on to nun 
my soul is blackened by the full 
guilt of a crime than which hell can 
name no deed of darker horror 

 hear this confession and hear my 
fixed resolve spurn me from you 
trample on me curse me oh cuse 
me but from your side living i will 
never depart you do not wish to re 
turn to your father s house i will 
slave for you work for you beg for 
you let me wash out some portion 
of my crime by a life-long devotion iu 
your service curse me mary spit 
upon me mary spurn me as the base 
thing i am should be spurned but i 
am your slave through life my crime 
shall be washed out in tears of blood 

vain were the power of language 
to paint the horror which paled the 
face of mary arlington as this dark 
confession fell shrieking on her ear 
she looked vacantly in the face of the 
kneeling woman she even toyed play 
fully with her long dark hair and 
then she gave utterance to a wild and 
maniac laugh 

 lorraine she cried lorraine 
ha ha ha he will return at last 
he will yet be mine lorraine lor

chapter thirteenth 

the gold which devil-bug wok 

slowly and silently devil-bug as- 
cended the staircase of monk-hall 
the lamp which he held extended af 
arm s length cast a flaring light over 
his distorted face now rendered len- 
fold more hideous by the tokens of 



the gold which devil bug won 



 



some terrible emotion he had bitten 
his upper lip until the blood trickled 
over his clenched teeth down to his 
pointed chin there was a glassy 
light in his solitary eye and a lower 
ing frown full of omen upon his pro 
tuberant brow 

slowly and silently with the light 
in his hand he ascended the massive 
staircase of monk-hall he uttered 
no word but fearful thoughts wee 
working at his heart one hour ago 
his heart had been softened into some 
thing like human feeling a very child 
might have led the savage and ruled 
him with a word that word a word 
of kindness to the child of ellen now 
they had stolen the child they had 
torn the fair girl from his arm and 
devil-bug was a savage once more 
like a black cloud arising from the 
stagnant waves of the dead sea so the 
feeling of fierce malignity to all the 
human race arose hideous and terrible 
from the depths of the monster s soul 

 ha he cried as he suddenly 
paused upon the stairway the 
corpse o that man harvey is a-layin 
beside the grave in the pit o monk- 
hall i must go down and bury it 
yes yes snug under the airth snug 
snug i ll put it out o sight 

he turned round and began to de 
scend the stairway 

 i ll bury it that i will and as 
the hard clods fall on his white face 
i ll laff ho ho ho i ll laff when i 
think o the prize that s in store for 
me the tall woman with the rale ripe 
lips and jet-black eyes 

he raised his left hand into the 
glare of the lamp and then a fiendish 
laugh convulsed his brawny chest 

 nobody don t see that ring on my 



little finger do they it s most 
small for the finger so i had to 
squeeze it on above the j int does 
anybody see it i wonders if ihe dead 
man ill see it when i holds it to his 
glassy eye and tells him about the 
prize it won for me 

again that low-toned yet horrible 
laugh echoed along the stairway and 
devil-bug flung the lamp wildly on 
high in the excess of his infernal glee 

 yes yes i ll force his cold eye 
lids slowly apart i ll rub the ring 
against the frozen eyeballs and i ll 
shout in his ear luke my boy you 
was a jolly feller when alive and now 
when you re dead a ring from your 
finger buys sick a prize for devil-bug 
sick a rale screamer of a prize first 
i ll bury the corpse and then ho ho 
ho i ll taste the red lips o that sweet 
young woman as is a-dyin to see mo 
up stairs 

laughing horribly to himself he 
descended into the vault of monk-hall 
there was a long pause of silence 
and the light of the moon streaming 
from the skylight in the roof faintly 
illumined the winding stairway near 
ly half an hour passed and the night 
began to wane towards its close when 
the beams of a lamp again flashed 
over the stairway and devil-bug 
came hastening upward with a strange 
and peculiar expression impressing the 
lines of his distorted visage 

with immense strides he hurried 
up the stairway flinging the hand 
which grasped the light merrily from 
side to side while that hideous sound 
like the laugh of a devil echoed from 
the depths of his chest 

 it rather puzzled me he mut 
tered and then chuckled gaily to him 



not 



mabel 



self quite a riddle a werry good 
riddle to be sure his features 
gleamed with an expression of infer 
nal triumph ho ho ho i see 
how it was done i see it all the 
feller come to himself and tried to 
crawl from the cellar and not knowin 
whar he wos he fell into the water 
and wos carried off jist like a dead rat 
or a cat or any other crittur i should 
ave like to have heered him howl 
when he found himself floatin into 
the underground channel ho ho 
ho 

in his glee he raised his left hand 
to his forehead and swept the thick 
hair aside from his eye the ring on 
his finger glittered in the light 

 the sweet young lady with the 
red lips and the dark eyes ha ha 
i don t think i ought to keep her 
waitin any longer the ring is on 
my finger and the prize is mine the 
han some woman is bought and sold 
ho ho ho 

hurrying up the stairway devil- 
bug presently attained the hall on the 
second floor in a moment he stood 
in front of the chamber where living 
stone the night before had witnessed 
the guilt of his wife 

raising the light overhead he ap 
plied his ear to the keyhole of the 
door and listened with speechless in 
tensity for a single instant 

that ghastly grimace that flashing 
eye that upraised hand with the ring 
glistening in the light oh dora 
proud and fearless dora better death 
than the foul dishonor which glares 
upon vou from the monster s face 

the lofty chamber was full of 
shndous the shadow of the lofty 



bed the shadows of the high-backed 
chairs the shadow of the antique 
dressing bureau all thrown along the 
floor by the trembling light which 
stood upon the small table in the 
centre of the gorgeous carpet then 
the fire on the wide hearth ever and 
anon would light up in a ruddy glare 
flinging along the carpet the shadow 
of a young and beautiful form seated 
by the table of ebony then the cur 
tains of the bed would rustle into the 
light presenting the soft azure of their 
folds to the glare of the fire or the 
mild beams of the lamp or the oval 
mirror would reflect both shadows 
and light with a gloomy and spectral 
effect or the uncouth figures de 
lineated in warm colors on the rich 
carpet would assume a temporary life 
as they basked in the glow that flashed 
from the fireside 

the chamber was full of sombre 
snadows and full of glaring flashes of 
light now the golden coronet sur 
mounting the canopy of the bed glit 
tered in the light and the rich silken 
folds of purple and azure which lined 
the lofty walls of the chamber were 
tinted with a lively glow and again 
the painting above the mantel where 
venus in all her softness and beauty 
lay uncovered amid the rosy freshness 
of the rising morn felt the gentle in 
fluence of a sudden flash from the 
hearth or warmed into life beneath 
the beams of the trembling lamp 

still amid thick shadows and glaring 
gleams of light along the floor was 
flung the shadow of a young and 
beautiful form 

dora livingstone sat beside the ta 
ble her cheek resting on her hand 
wmie the glossy tresses of he dark 



the gold which devil-e ug won 



 



flair fell clustering to her shoulders 
the lovely outlines of her form were 
still disclosed in the close-fitting frock- 
coat which became her so well the 
collar of the coat was thrown back 
and the shirt flung open at the throat 
disclosed the whiteness of her snowy 
neck with a glimpse of her bosom 
now heaving and throbbing with tu 
multuous thoughts 
 she was very beautiful was that 
proud and scheming woman in her 
male disguise the light fell warmly 
over her wide shoulders so volup 
tuous in their outline over the rounded 
fullness of her bust over the slender 
gracefulness of the waist as the close- 
fitting frock-coat gathered round her 
form with the nicety of a glove 

she was very beautiful and yet 
along each cheek of her queenly coun- 
terrance there flashed a spot of vivid 
and burning red which betokened the 
feverish anxiety which absorbed the 
soul of the proud woman while her 
dark eyes flashing with a clear and 
brilliant glance fraught with unuttera 
ble meaning glared upon the thick 
shadows of the chamber with a fixed 
and immoveable gaze her brow was 
calm and unfrowning as that of the 
sleeping babe and the emotion which 
absorbed her soul was manifested in 
the agitation of her bosom as it swell 
ed into the light in the compression 
of her red ripe lips in the feverish 
spot of burning red upon each bloom 
ing cheek 

thus had she sat for hours more 
like a criminal waiting for the morn 
which was to bring her fair neck to 
the doomsman s axe than the deter 
mined murderess waiting for her victim 



chamber gradually awcd her soul as 
the flashing gleams of light struggling 
with the thick masses of shadow im 
parted a spectural effect to the cham 
ber and its costly furniture the 
thoughts of the proud woman sitting 
there so silently in that unwomanly 
disguise dwelt on the past and its 
memories 

first like some pale and reproach 
ful ghost sent from the grave to warn 
her of her guilt arose the thought of 
the days when she was a pure-hearted 
and innocent girl 

the hand which supported her 
cheek trembled and her lips grew 
ashy white the face of her mother 
was before her that face with its out 
lines broken by grief and the large 
black eyes dilated to an unnatural 
size by sickness and pain arose before 
her for a moment in appaling distinct 
ness 

starting with involuntary terror 
dora s gaze was fixed upon the gor 
geous bed at the sight of that 
canopy with its luxuriant folds and its 
coronet of stars all the blackness of 
her crime rushed upon the dishonored 
wife there upon that couch of 
shame had she lain down the purity 
of a wife to take up the dishonor of an 
adultress 

dora turned her eyes away from 
the bed and tried to drown the silent 
voieesjspeaking foreyerwithin her by 
the thought of the prize for which she 
had trafficked her soul glowing 
visions of pomp and power the coronet 
on her brow and the title to her name 
the smile of a queen beaming upon 
her face and the glories of ancestral 
rank flashing all around her glowing 



and now as the silence of the i visions in which her grasping ambi- 



 



mabel 



tion was crowned with triumph dawn 
ed upon her soul 

and yet whether it was from the 
feverish anxiety of her long and terri 
ble watch or whether the future al 
ready gleamed upon her soul mingling 
its revelations with the remembrances 
of memory whenever she thought of the 
 coronet which was soon to entwine her 
brow it became all loathsome with 
crawling grave-worms the queen 
who smiled upon her became a grin 
ning skeleton and all the lordly flat 
terers whom she had fancied kneeling 
at her feet suddenly arose with the 
ghastliness of death painted on their 
faces while around their icy limbs the 
death-shroud waved in drooping folds 

dora covered her face with her 
hands by one sudden effort she 
banished these thoughts the echo 
of a footstep struck upon her ear 

she started she turned pale she 
arose to her feet 

 it is he she muttered with ashy 
lips while her hands were clasped 
over her bosom it is the mur 
derer 

she listened eagerly for the foot 
step it approached the door of her 
chamber it passed it was but the 
footstep of a reveller from the banquet 
room dora resumed her seat and 
breathed freely again 

then leaning her cheek on her 
hand she endeavored to banish all 
thought from her soul while her ear 
drank in the slightest echo of a sound 

worn out by feverish suspense she 
fell into a brief and half-wakeful slum 
ber in which her soul was startled by 
terrible dreams the faces of the dead 
were before her sealed eyes grinning 
hideously in her face as if in derision 



of all her ambitious plans and men a 
coffin black as midnight was borne 
slowly past by hands outstretched 
from a lowering cloud then the 
death-stricken countenance of luke 
harvey arose from the coffin-lid and 
smiled upon her in scorn while his 
hands tore the shroud from his limbs 
and scattered the fragments in her 
very face dora started from her 
brief and feverish slumber and gazed 
around the lonely chamber the bed 
with its costly hangings arrested her 
eye 

 ha she exclaimed in a low 
whisper as though her blood was 
chilled by the fear that one loud tone 
of her voice might arouse the dead 
into life from the thick shadows of the 
room my soul is terrified by 
strange fears yet i will endure it all 
skeletons have arisen and gibbered in 
my face the dead long- forgotten have 
been with me and a coffin has been 
borne before me by hands outstretch 
ed from a lowering cloud yet will i 
endure it all ha ha her deep- 
toned whisper was succeeded by a 
wild and startling laugh such a 
ridiculous fancy it is quite laugh 
able i just now imagined that my 
husband might have been looking 
through the bed-curtains last night 
while i slumbered unconscious of his 
gaze how very amusing 

she laughed gaily and her face 
brightened with an expression of care 
less glee 

the sound of a heavy footstep re 
sounded in the hall without 

dora stood as if frozen to the floor 
the laugh died in her throat 

 tis he she murmured in a 
hollow whisper 



the gold which devil-bug won 



 



nd in a moment devil-bug stood 
before her flinging the light aloft with 
his extended arm while his features 
were agitated with a grin of triumph 

 is it done murmured dora in a 
whisper 

 lady behold the ring exclaim 
ed devil-bug slowly approaching the 
proud woman with the ring flash 
ing in the light it is done good 
lady i ve got the ring now for the 
goold 

 he is dead exclaimed dora 
and a wild light flashed from her dark 
eyes i have triumphed she 
clasped her hands together with a 
convulsive gesture and for a moment 
stood motionless as a statue 

yes lady he s stone dead and 
the rats jolly fellers have already 
begin to crawl over his carcase 
devil-bug advanced a step nearer the 
proud dame and glared upon her with 
his solitary eye 

i have triumphed rank and 
power are mine not an enemy in 
my path nor a shadow on my future 
i shall walk among the titled dames 
of the royal court i shall feel a coro 
net pressing on my brow to-mor 
row livingstone and i depart for 
hawkwood from hawkwood liv 
ingstone never returns alive in a 
month ay in one short month 
and her form rose towering to its full 
heighth while her eye flashed and 
brightened with all the glory of the 
vision that burst upon her soul in 
one short monthdora livingstone 
the cobbler s grand-daughter shall be 
the lady dora dalveney of lyndes 
wold 

 but the goold good lady the 

goold 
 



the proud woman started at the 
sound of that harsh voice she started 
and beheld the eye of devil-bug glar 
ing upon her lovely face with a look 
of terrible meaning his huge hands 
were crossed upon his breast and with 
his head drooped low he stood regard 
ing her with a fixed gaze that gaze 
spoke volumes better for the fair 
bosom of dora to have been torn by 
the talons of an enraged tiger than to 
have had the beauty of her proud 
countenance devoured by the animal 
fire of that steady look 

she started with involuntary sur 
prise she receded a single step and 
then with a faint and trembling voice 
she addressed the savage 

 the ring she whispered avert 
ing her face as she reached forth her 
hand 

 here it is good lady and the 
solitary eye of devil-bug flashed with 
a glance of gloating admiration as he 
extended the ring 

dora looked steadily at the ring for 
a single moment 

 it was my mother s ring she 
whispered in husky tones i gave 
it her voice trembled i gave it 
to him on the night when i consented 
to become his wife as a pledge of my 
love 

these words fell trembling from 
her lips and then like a flash of 
lightning all her dreams of ambition 
passed away and a terrible memory 
agitated her soul 

 i gave it to him while his eyes 
were fixed upon mine and my hand 
trembled in his i gave it to him 
while his kiss was yet fresh upon my 
lips and now great god now i 
have murdered him

no words can depict the utter agony 
of look and emphasis which accom 
panied these words her proud form 
rising in all its queenly stature quiver 
ed from head to foot as she held the 
ring extended in one hand while the 
other shaded her eyes from the light 

 the goold good lady the goold 

devil-bug suddenly advanced and 
grasping her extended arm with his 
talon fingers impressed a loathsome 
kiss upon the fair white hand which 
held the glittering ring 

she started with a look of silent dis 
gust she endeavored to fling the 
savage from her but his talon fingers 
gathered more closely around her arm 
his grasp was like the embrace of a 
vice 

 yo made the bargain good lady 
yo sold yourself black eyes poutin 
lips and all for the ring d ye think 
i m sich a fool as to be cheated out of 
my wages in this here way don t 
think sich a thing good lady old 
devil-bug wants thegpom you pro 
mised 

 releasee me whispered dora 
with an ashen face as she felt the 
grasp of his fingers on her arm let 
me pass from this room and from this 
house and i will reward you with gold 
beyond all your expectations i will 
make you rich for life 

 ho ho ho chuckled devil-bug 
 here s a tall woman afore me with 
a look like a queen a lip like a cherry 
a cheek like a peach and eyes like 
di monds in a jew ler s winder she 
axes me to give up all this he 
pointed to her voluptuous form she 
axes me to give up all this for goold 
redikulus 

dora s countenance suddenly grew 



lovely with all the hues of the summer 
dawn her eye dilated and sparkled 
with a clear and burning light cast 
ing her glance over devilbug s shoul 
der she beheld her cloak flung over 
the rounds of a chair on a table be 
sides this chair lay the pair of loaded 
pistols which she had brought with her 
to monk-hall 

could i but obtain them the 
thought crossed her soul like a ray of 
hope i would defy the monster to 
his teeth 

 lady there s a werry purty bloom 
on yer check and there s a werry rich 
look in your eyes he paused and 
raised her fair white hand to his loath 
some lips then reaching forth his 
other arm with his blazing eye devour 
ing the loveliness of her face he endea 
vored to encircle her form with his arm 

 i am faint muttered dora in a 
whisper and she reached forth her 
hands as if to save herself from falling 
to the floor while her eye closed as in 
a deadly swoon 

 ho ho my beauty faints does 
she muttered devil-bug catching 
her form in his arms werry purty 
in the beauty that is it s a genteel 
way o sayin she consents i spose 

with her head resting on his shoul 
der while her bosom almost touched 
his face devil-bug encircled her form 
in his arms and bore her slowly along 
the floor he laid her gently down in 
the chair where her cloak had been 
thrown 

then stepping backward he quietly 
surveyed her voluptuous form while 
that look of animal admir gtn red 
dened over his face 

 she lays there w eautiful 

her head thrown b ttle her eyes 



the gold which devil-bug won 



 



closed and her red nps parted sich 
white teeth and that form all dress 
ed in some gentleman s coat and pants 
ho ho it all belongs to me sich a 
nice bosom it looks quite purty with 
the shirt collar thrown wide open abou 
he neck an that s all mine 

the swooning woman lay reclining 
upon the folds of the cloak flung over 
the rounds of the chair while the ligh 
streaming over the back of devil-bug 
fell mild and softened over her lovely 
face with the eyelids closed as if in 
death never had dora looked so 
beautiful never had her lips been 
tinted with such a rose-bud freshness 
never had such a lively glow bloomed 
from the fulness of her cheek never 
had the tresses of her unbound hair 
fell in such bewitching carelessness 
around her countenance and along her 
snowy neck 

she lay there like a beautiful incar 
nation of sleep while the savage stood 
gazing upon her with a look of in 
creasing admiration his solitary eye 
grew loathsome with its expression of 
brute passion while his lips were 
agitated by a hideous smile 

 hello my beauty s a comin too 
look she moves her head she rests 
it on the table at her side her eye-lids 
are openin agin 

in her unconcious state dora gently 
moved her arm and as gently laid the 
hand upon the white cloth of the table 
at the same moment her eye-lids 
faintly unclosed and she gazed around 
with a bewildered stare 

 soh my beauty s had a faintin 
ipell all to herself muttered devil - 
bug with a hideous chuckle as he ap 
proached the side of the half-conscious 
woman i believe i ll taste her lips 



laying his hand on her shoulder he 
stooped slowly down and the shadow 
of his face darkened her countenance 
his loathsome lips well-nigh touched 
the ripe lips of the proud woman when 
her hand moved nervously along the 
white cloth of the table nearer drew 
his lips his hot breath streamed over 
her cheek 

 one kiss my purty beauty only 
one kiss 

with one sudden bound dora liv 
ingstone sprung from the chair and 
when devil -bug looked for her again 
she stood in the centre of the floor hei 
eyes flashing fire her long dark hair 
streaming wildly from her brow while 
each extended hand held a grim pistol 
at the monster s heart 

 now devil i defy you she ex 
claimed in a tone of withering scorn 
 with a loaded pistol in either hand 
i will fight my way from this den 
advance but a step and i will stretch 
you out upon the floor a lifeless corpse 

devil-bug started and covered his 
face with his hands as if utterly con- 
bunded by this sudden movement of 
the beautiful woman 

 ha ha the scornful laugh of 
dora broke on his ear do i hold 
he blood-hound at bay monster 
where is your courage now stand 
gtack and let me pass or i fire this 
pistol 

and with deadly aim she points the 
istol at his brawny chest dc vil-bug 
raised his face from his hands every 
mrsh lineament of his countenance 
was convulsed with an expression of 
iendish laughter 

 ho ho what a sweet creetur you 
re to-w be-sure be so kind as to 
low my brains out with them pistols

it ill quite dissap int me if you don t 
that s a good girl oh fire away my 
duck wot a pity it is for you that 
them bull-dogs ain t got no balls in em 
ha ha wot in the devil made you 
leave em down stairs with yer cloak 
while i showed yo the way up in this 
room i did nt draw out the balls 
of course i did nt who the devil said 
i did 

dora s face grew deathly pale with 
an involuntary gesture she extended 
her hands the pistols fell to the floor 
with a heavy deadened sound 

 all is lost she muttered as her 
hands dropped listlessly by her side 

so it is cried devil-bug and 
with the celerity of lightning he sprang 
forward and seized the pistols ho 
ho my gal did i fool you that time 
the pistols are loaded but you don t 
get em agin no you don t upon my 
word 

 fool that i was cried dora with 
a flashing glance oh that i had 
lodged the bullet in his heart she 
turned away and pressed her red lip 
between her teeth until the blood started 
from the skin 

 now my ducky dear down on 
your knees and axe for marcy 
devil-bug advanced with a scowling 
brow while each extended hand held 
a pistol toward her form down on 
your knees or i fire 

 fire echoed dora as her proud 
lip curved with scorn fire and i 
will thank you she folded her arms 
and confronted the savage with a fear 
less brow 

 pluck reg lar pluck exclaimed 
devil-bug with a stare of involuntary 
admiration but come my gal you 
made the bargain an you must stick 



to it i ve stood foolin long enough 
its time to put an end to these small 
matters now for the goold 

he dropped the pistols on the floor 
with one convulsive bound like a wild 
beast darting on his prey he sprang 
forward and gathered his long arms 
around the form of the proud woman 
while his rough face rested against her 
velvet cheek and her lip felt the pres 
sure of his kiss 

starting with a shriek she endea 
vored to tear her form from his em 
brace but in vain she the proud 
and haughty woman with the outcast 
feasting on her lip and revelling on her 
beauty even in that moment of des 
pair the thought aroused all her ener 
gies she sprang from his embrace 
her convulsive efforts for a moment 
loosened the grasp of his arms but in 
another moment they gathered around 
her form with a closer pressure and 
like a bird fluttering in the coils of a 
snake she lay in his power and at his 
mercy 

she sank helplessly on her knees 
devil-bug bent over her kneeling form 
and with his arms gathered round her 
waist impressed his loathsome kisa 
upon her pouting lips 

nothing could save the proud beauty 
now dishonored and by a devil in 
human shape the thought filled her 
veins with madness her eyes seemed 
all on fire with the terrible intensity of 
her thoughts 

his hot breath streamed over her 
cheek his sneering chuckle echoed 
n her ears like a death-knell his 
solitary eye drank in the beauty of hei 
countenance with a look of brutal pas- 
sion dora gathered her strength foi 
one last struggle her brain throbbing 



the gold which devil-bug won 



 



with wild delirium she shouted a name 
that rose to her lips she knew not 
why she shouted a name of the olden 
time 

 luke she shrieked tossing her 
rms madly on high luke save 
ne oh save me 

as if her voice had aroused the dead 
rom the grave the secret door slid 
jack and luke harvey stood revealed 
a dim taper held in his extended hand 
flashing its light over a pale face spot 
ted with drops of blood and marked 
by a fearful gash which laid open the 
flesh along the right temple his 
dress all torn and disordered was soiled 
by the earth of the grave and his long 
black hair hung lank and stiffened 
around his face his eye dark pierc 
ing and snake-like at all times was 
now animated by a lustre that seemed 
supernatural 

there in that same doorway which 
the night before had been passed by 
the husband in search of his guilty 
wife in that same doorway stood 
luke harvey gazing upon the savage 
and his victim with one fixed and 
immoveable gaze 

 luke save me save me shrieked 
dora unconscious that the man whom 
she had sold to death stood gazing 
upon her peril luke oh save me 

his head bent down devil-bug sud 
denly felt the gleam of a strange light 
flashing over his face he raised his 
head he beheld luke standing silent 
and pale in the doorway and then 
flinging dora from him uttered a wild 
howl of surprise 

 g d d n was his solitary 
ejaculation tf there ain t that feller 
come to life agin 

he was about to rise from his feet 



when the apparition rushed forward 
and seizing a pistol from the floor 
struck devil-bug a fierce and fearful 
blow over the forehead 

his skull echoed the blow like a 
piece of metal ringing on the anil 
with a curse on his lips devil-bug 
rose fiercely to his feet but the pistol 
again descended again that ringing 
sound the monster fell heavily to the 
flopr he lay senseless as the oaken 
planks on which he rested 

thrown prostrate along the floor 
dora arose into a kneeling position 
and gazed around in speechless won 
der 

tall and erect the dim light held in 
his extended hand luke harvey 
stood before her gazing down on her 
face with a saddened and immoveable 
look the light flashing upward gave 
a ghastly and fearful appearance to his 
pale countenance while his blazing eye 
encountered hers with a look so 
strange and piercing that she was 
forced to avert her gaze 

 his ghost comes to reproach me 
muttered dora in an almost inaudible 
yet thrilling whisper 

 oh dora dora said a calm and 
deep-toned voice rendered fearful in 
its very calmness by its striking con 
trast with the usual sneering tones of 
luke harvey oh dora dora lit 
tle did i think in the times when i 
gathered you to my heart and tasted 
the freshness of your virgin lip and 
in very fondness of passion called you 
my own sweet wife little did i think 
in those times now gone forever that 
a moment could ever come when i 
would behold a scene like this dora 
whom i once so fondly loved tnrown 
prostrate on the floor of this polluted

chamber her person her honor the 
price of a cold-blooded murder oh 
dora dora you might have spared 
me this shame 

the sneer had gone from luke s 
tongue he stood gazing upon the 
kneeling woman with a trembling voice 
and a look of agony even while he 
looked a scalding tear rolled down his 
deathly cheek 

 your body the price of a cold 
blooded murder he uttered in a whis 
per as his immoveable gaze was still 
rivetted to her countenance 

murder echoed dora gazing 
wildly in his face 

 yes murder replied luke in that 
same tone of unnatural calmness i 
overheard your plot dora overheard 
every word in the darkness i stood 
beside the door of the room down-stairs 
i saw you enter i heard you bargain- 
ing for my blood oh dora i have 
felt something like a desire for revenge 
whenever i thought how you trifled 
with my feelings and trampled on my 
heart but now dora now you are 
revenged upon me far better the 
knife of the assassin had cut my heart 
in twain than to look upon you in such 
shame as this she was indeed re 
venged upon him there was agony 
in his look and tone in his pale face 
and trembling voice agony worse than 
death 

dora was silent she bowed her 
fece on her bosom as she knelt at his 
feet she bowed her face and veiled her 
eyes with her hands the ring drop 
ped from her finger 

luke knelt silently by her side he 
took the ring from the floor 

 this ring you gave me on the 
night when you first consented to be 



mine he paid in that calm aid 
deep-toned voice then it was t 
testimonial of our love now it is the 
witness of your shame 

dora shuddered that voice speak 
ing so sadly to her ear penetrated her 
very heart with remorse 

she raised her face from her bosom 
she gazed upon his countenance in 
silence it was a strange and awful 
moment the rejected lover kneeling 
beside the proud woman at once the 
faithless mistress and the guilty wife 

luke she whispered in a tone 
strangely in contrast with her usual 
commanding voice luke if evei 
you loved me take that pistol from the- 
floor and place it to my forehead 
am utterly lost death would come ti 
me now like a welcome messenger 

there was silence for a single mo 
ment they gazed sadly in each othery 
faces while the same thought rose 
from each heart dora thought now 
pure and happy would have been her 
life had she became the wife of luke 
luke thought how dear and holy a 
thing she would have been to him as a 
wife she the fallen and dishonored 

 curse on the fate that severed us 
he cried wringing his hands wiih a 
mad gesture 

 there is an awful gulf between us 
now i am lost and lost forever said 
dora as the first tears of repentance 
which she had ever shed rolled down 
her cheeks 

 dora there is yet a glorious hope 
for you cried luke as his ghastly 
features warmed with an expression of 
enthusiasm that might almost have 
been called holy promise me that 
you will renounce all unhallowed love 
promise me that you will from this 



the gold which devil-bug won 



 



time forth dissolve all connection with 
the poor creature who has dishonored 
you by a foul crime promise me that 
you will ever be to livingstone a true 
and faithful wife and i swear before 
god to sustain you in your course to 
defend you from all harm 

oh that tone that look that beseech 
ing gesture of the rejected lover dora 
was melted to the heart 

radiant with all the beauty of a new 
formed and holy resolve she raised 
her heart and eyes to heaven 

 i promise she cried and the 
tears rolled down her cheeks 

i swear to sustain you to the death 
cried luke raising his hands on high 
there was silence for a single moment 
and the character of the place in which 
they knelt the guilt of the wife the 
revenge of the lover all were forgotten 
that resolve hovered over their hearts 
like the halo around the cross of a 
dying saint 

in a moment luke raised her gently 
from the floor and silently gathered 
the cloak around her disguised form 
she reddened to the very roots of her 
hair as he placed the cap upon her 
head her ambition her recklessness 
of soul alike were gone she felt the 
modesty of a wife once more she 
stood ready to depart while the form 
of the insensible savage lay prostrate 
on the floor 

 in a moment dora i will be with 
you said luke as he turned toward 
the secret door in a moment i will 
lead you from the place 

dora was alone oh what a tide of 
tumultuous thoughts came rushing 
madly over her brain as she stepped 
across the floor it seemed to her that 
she trod on air that the present was 



some glorious dream from which she 
would soon awake to the reality of life 
and the pollution of crime the tones 
of her former lover lingered yet upon 
her ear how like the days of stainless 
innocence and love then the affec 
tion of livingstone his care for her 
slightest wish his doting love came 
like a burst of sunshine on her soul 
with a trembling lip and flashing-eye 
she wondered to herself that idle toys 
like the world s ambition and the love 
which is born of guilt should ever 
have lured her from the duty of a wife 
the purity of a woman 

as these thoughts flashed over her 
soul luke stood by her side again 

 give this to your husband at the 
earliest opportunity he said as he 
placed a sealed note in her hands 
you start for hawkewood in the 
morning for god s sake do not fail 
to give him this 

dora placed the note in her bosom 
then her large eyes dark as midnight 
and lustrous as the morn encountered 
the glance of her former lover and for 
a moment they silently gazed upon 
each other 

 oh dora my fever of revenge is 
past till this hour i never knew how 
your image had wound itself into my 
very heart 

 and i would have been your assas 
sin dora exclaimed turning sud 
denly pale oh luke i am too vile 
a thing for your slightest notice i am 
how the word chokes me i am an 
adulteress 

 let the past be with the past 
said luke in a solemn tone as taking 
her hands within his own he raised 
them on high let us now in the sight 
of heaven confirm our mutual vow

fools that they were as they 
stood there in that lonely room hand 
linked in hand and eyes raised to 
heaven fate was weaving its threads 
of doom around and about them silent 
and stern and immutable fate was 
surrounding them with its serpent-coils 
while it looked upon them in scorn 
and laughed in derision as its awful 
hand pointed to the future to-mor 
row it murmured ha ha to-morrow 

and while they stood in that lonely 
chamber hand linked in hand and eyes 
raised to heaven in his counting room 
silent and alone the husband mixed the 
poison which on the morrow was to lay 
his guilty wife a stiffened corpse 

bending over the table on which 
were scattered the various drugs 
which composed the fatal draught 
bending over the table with the light 
of the taper falling upon his death- 
stricken face the husband laughed 
madly to himself and whispered in 
husky tones to-morrow ha ha to 
morrow 

fools that they were to think that 
fate which drives its iron wheels over 
hearts and thrones and graves would 
turn aside in its career for them 

 away dora cried luke away 
from monk-hall they moved to- 
ward the door the wretch thrown 
prostrate on the carpet groaned 

ha i forgot the keys cried 
luke retracing his steps there 
they are he bent over the form of 
devil-bug in a moment your 
escape is certain 

he led her from the room and down 
the stairs in a few moments they 
etood in the doorkeeper s den by the 



dim light the negroes might be di 
cerned sleeping by the fireside 

it required but another moment fop 
luke to place the key in the lock and 
open the massive door 

she stood in the doorway with the 
cloak thrown round her form and the 
beams of the setting moon hilling on 
her face 

 go and god go with you dora 
whispered luke pushing her gently 
from the door 

 do you not go with me she 
whispered as she paused upon the 
threshold there is danger for you 
within these walls perchance death 

 i have other matters to arrange 
answered luke i must avenge 
wrong and defend innocence go r 
dora and remember your vow 

he pushed her gently across the 
threshold he closed the door and stood 
alone in the doorkeeper s den 

the negroes still slumbered by the 
fireside and the faint light of the fire 
illumined the face of luke with a 
ghastly radiance 

he advanced toward the fire he 
placed his hand hurriedly against hi 
brow while his eye grew animate with 
strange and powerful emotion 

 the world would call me a fool 
for acting thus he whispered true 
she trampled on my heart true she 
dishonored her husband true she bar 
gained with the ruffian for my life but 
god alone knows how the faoe we 
once loved to look upon ever main 
tains a strange influence over the heart

ed into the mansion he felt the 

strength generated by the excitement 

which had agitated his soul during the 

past hour he felt this unnatural strength 

jf passing from him like a shadow he 

stretched forth his hands in the effort 

 to preserve his balance but in vain 

with a cry of agony on his lips he 
fell helpless to the floor 

half an hour passed and devil-bug 
stood over the form of the prostrate 
man with a light in his hand he re 
garded the pale face of luke with a 
scowl of fierce malignity his own 
distorted countenance spotted with 
blood near the temples and livid in hue 
assumed an expression of savage hate 

 soh soh mister yo helped the 
woman to dig off did yo he mut 
tered placing his foot upon the breast 
of the insensible man i ve a notion 
to knife your wizzin wonders how 
you d look with a small air-hole in 
your throat 

he drew an old-fashioned spanish 
knife from the breast of his coarse gar 
ment as he spoke the blade long 
pointed and glittering flew open with a 
touch of the spring stooping over the 
form of the insensible luke he applied 
the knife to his unbared throat and with 
a wild grimace destorting his features 
he moved it gently along the skin 

 i on y wants to see how near to 
the skin i can go without cuttin his 
wynd-pipe ho ho ho 

there was a great deal of the phi 
losopher in devil -bug never a doctor 
of all the schools with his dissecting 
knife in hand and the corpse of a sub 
ject before him could have manifested 
more nerve and coolness than the 
savage of monk-hall slowly and 



gently along the throat of the insensi 
ble man he moved the glittering knife 
holding its keen edge within a hair s 
breadth of the skin then as if to 
show that his spirits were not depressed 
by the solemnity of the operation he 
laughed merrily to himself and hum 
med the catch of some dismal song 

suddenly his protuberent brow grew 
heavy with a scowl he clenched the 
handle of the knife with a grasp of 
fierce resolution and in a moment the 
blade glittered in his upraised hand 

 i ll put an end to this he mut 
tered hoarsely i ll give him a taste 
o this piece o hardware crack me 
over the skull with the butt o that are 
pistol did he 

for a moment the knife quivered in 
the air above his head and the scowl 
grew darker over his brow the next 
instant as if some strange thought had 
suddenly taken his soul by storm the 
frown cleared away and the knife fell 
from his hand and stuck upright in the 
oaken floor 

 nell he slowly muttered yer 
only hope lies here he pointed to 
the body of the insensible luke 
 here lies yer hope and yer fortin 
this man can make all matters straight 
he can place yo afore the proud folks 
o this town as the daughter o living 
stone and nobody else can do it i d i 
rayther burn myself alive than to hurt i 
a hair of his head 

stooping to the floor he raised luke 
on his shoulder he bore him from the 
den up the stairs and into his room 
he laid the form of the insensible man 
upon the bed and then rushed hurri 
edly from the room and down the 
stairs again 

in a few moments the lamp which 



of- 



mabel 



he held in his hand flashed over the 
massive brick pillars of the dead vault 

the place was infested with a deathly 
chill and the atmosphere was like the 
breath of a pestilence devil-bug 
gazed calmly round the vault as if 
marking the rows of coffins stored 
away in the nooks of the walls or the 
fragments of the human skeleton 
scattered along the floor then he 
gazed upon the pillars of massive brick 
and then shifting the light from side 
to side he seemed to feel a strange 
pleasure in observing the heavy 
shadows which ran along the distant 
walls or crept over the arching ceiling 
above 

 i d a most forgot it he soloquized 
as he seated his deformed body on the 
floor the doctor sent for me last 
night the one what wants me to steal 
dead bodies for him i must go airly 
in the mornin he pays me well and 
i likes the business sich a jolly busi 
ness to creep over the wall o some 
grave yard in the dead o the night 
nd with a spade in yer hand to turn 
up the airth of a new made grave to 
fnash the coffin lid into small pieces 
wiih a blow o the spade and to drag 
ihe stiff corpse out from its restin 
place with the shroud so white and 
clean spotted by the damp clay to 
kiver the corpse with an old over-coat 
or a coffee bag and bear it off to the 
doctor with his penknife s and his dag 
gers and his gim lets hoo hoo 
he emitted a wild imitation of the 
bcreech-owlfrom his compressed teeth 
 sich a jolly business 

then placing the lamp on the floor 
and drawing the fragment of a crumb 
ling coffin beneath his elbow he rested 
his brawny cheek upon his hand while 



his solitary eye glared fiercely upon 
the thick shadows of the vault he 
sat thus for a few moments when his 
senses were overpowered by slumber 
and he lay there huddled in a heap 
along the floor sleeping with his eye 
wide open 

the light flashed over his face 
while the muscles worked as if under 
the influence of a spell the brow was 
corrugated with wrinkles like thick 
cords the eye flashed and sparkled and 
glared the teeth were clenched together 
and then around the quivering lips the 
white foam began to gather like the 
froth on the nostrils of the dying war- 
horse 

the soul of devil-bug was passing 
through the mazes of a fearful dream 
this it was that made his eye glare 
and his lips move this it was sent the 
cold shudder through his sleeping form 
this it was that clenched his hands and 
made him grasp wildly at the air as 
he lay there his soul absorbed by an 
awful night-mare a world of phan 
toms passed before him 

the sight that he saw in his sleep 
the vision that broke upon him was 
it a revelation from the other world 
was it a prophecy whispered to the 
monster s soul by the tongues of 
angels 



chapter fourteenth 
devil-bug s dream 

when first he slept the phantoms 
of his murdered victims rose before 
him the man with the broken jaw 
and the lolling tongue the woman with 



 



ne blood falling drop by drop from the 
nollow skull then the eyes of the 
man started from his death-stricken 
face then he could see the neck of the 
woman quiver as with the convulsive 
throes of death and then he could hear 
the low-pattering sound of blood drop 
ping from the hollow skull the 
sleeper groaned in agony the woman 
reached forth her skinny arms and 
clasped them round his neck and ap 
plied her thin lips wet with blood to his 
ear and whispered murder in a tone 
of horrible laughter 

and the man lolled his blackening 
tongue ugh how clammy and how 
cold against the face of devil -bug 
and looked into his very soul with 
those blood-shot eyes almost touching 
the forehead of the dreamer then 
the dream became confused and wan 
dering devil-bug was surrounded 
by a hazy atmosphere with coffins 
floating slowly past and the stars 
shining through the eyes of skulls and 
the sun pouring his livid light straight 
downward into a wilderness of new- 
made graves which extended yawning 
and dismal over the surface of a bound 
less plain 

then the sun assumed the shape of 
a grinning skeleton-head and the stars 
went dancing through the dim atmos 
phere dancing round the sun each 
star gleaming through the orbless 
socket of a skull and the blood-red 
moon went sailing by her crescent 
face rising above a huge coffin which 
floated through the livid air like a 
barque from hell then the sky was 
full of comets darting along like light 
ning each comet with a long white 
shroud sweeping the heavens as it 
rushed through the air and then sky 



and sun and moon and stars were 
succeeded by thick and impenetrable 
darkness there was a long pause 
and the darkness resolved itself into 
shape devil-bug stood in the midst 
of a boundless plain covered with a 
darkness like that which betokens the 
approach of day the whole sky was 
changed into one vast curtain which 
hung in midnight folds across the im 
mensity of space 

the dreamer looked upon this awful 
curtain in awe and wonder 

this cried a voice speakingshrilly 
from the darkness this is the cur 
tain of the theatre of hell and 
then devil-bug laughed loudly to him 
self as if in glee at the merry conceit 

at the very instant there arose from 
the dark plain a chorus of shrieks and 
groans and yells of agony it was as 
though the dying in some vast battle 
field had suddenly in one breath sent 
their combined death-shrieks to the 
heavens above yell on yell groan 
on groan continued to rend the air and 
then a horrible chorus of laughter 
broke on the ear of the dreamer 

 this cried the voice this is the 
orchestra of hell 

then the curtain slowly rose up 
up the dark folds ascended higher 
higher the theatre of hell lay bare 
to his view devil-bug started for 
ward and looked upon the scene and 
howled in glee 

what he then beheld may never be 
told to the ears of living man oh 
horrible and ghastly that sight of all 
sights the most dread oh horrible 
and ghastly on every wave a lost 
soul on every breeze of that heated 
air a groan of death that throne 
rising black and lurid from the centre 



 



mabel 



of the chaos of flame oh picture its 
horror to no living ear but the fair 
bosomed women floating on those 
waves are they not spared and the 
babes lifting their tiny hands on high is 
there no mercy for them and the old 
mendashed against the red-hot rocksis 
there no deliverance for them look 
look strain your eyes devil-bug 
behold that sight of grandeur that 
wave ha ha see how it rises from 



the bosom of the sea that wave 
fire how it roars around the throne 
how it towers and swells and in the 
fiery surf which crests its summit 
look look there are millions of souls 
shrieking for mercy only a drop 
of water only a drop of wuter 

the orchestra of hell strikes up its 
music and the play goes on 

suddenly all became dark again 
and the dream changed

hb stood in the wide street of a magnificent city ali around him from lofty 
windows the glare of many lights flashed out upon the winter night above the 
clear cold sky of a calm winter twilight overarched he far extending perspective 
brilliant with light and life which marked the extent and grandeur of that wide 
street of a gorgeous cityj 

devil-bug looked around him and beheld the sidewalks lined with throngs of 
wayfarers some clad in purple and fine linen some with rags fluttering around 
their wasted forms here was the lady in all the glitter of her plumes and silks 
and diamonds and by her side the beggar child stretched forth its thin and skinny 
arm asking in feeble tones for the sake of god some charity good lady and 
the lady smiled and uttered some laughing word to the man of fashion by her side 
with his slim waist and effeminate face she uttered a remark of careless scorn 
and passed the beggar-child unheeded by here passing slowly onward with a 
look of sanctimony a white cravat and robes of sable was the lordly bishop whose 
firm step and salacious eye betokened at once his arrogance and guilt here was 
the man of law with his parchment book and his cold grey eye here was the 
judge with his visage of solemnity and his pocket-book crammed full with bribes 
and here hungry and lean was the mechanic in his tattered garb looking to the 
clear blue sky above as he asked god s vengeance upon the world that robbed 
and starved himj 

devil-bug rubbed his hands with glee there was something so exhilarating 
to him in the sight of all this in the spectacle ofthe lofty windows stored with 
silks and satins gold and jewels enriched with the tribute of a whole world in 
the animation of the sidewalk its crowds of wayfarers its rich and poor its 
worldly and its holy men that old devil-bug laughed gaily to himself and rubbed 
his hands in very glee 

wandering slowly onward he was wrapt in wonder at the magnificence whkk 
broke upon his vision when suddenly a massive edifice rose before him with long 
rows of marble columns and a massive dome breaking into the blue of the sky far 
overhead beside this gorgeous structure which appeared to be in progress of 
erection for there was scaffolding about its columns and the implements of the 
workmen were scattered around beside this edifice arose a small and unpre 
tending structure of brick only two stories high with its plain old-fashioned 
steeple rising but half-way to the summit of the marble palace this small 
and unpretending structure was in ruins the roof was torn from the steeple the 

 



die ttir sast has of tiic tvuatirr 

windows were concealed by rough boards and from one corner the bricks ha 
been thrown down 

devil-bug when he beheld this structure in ruins while the marble palace by 
its side arose in such grandeur upon the clear blue sky smiled to himself and 
clapped his hands boisterously together 

i this he cried pointing to the edifice this should be the old state house 
and i must be in the quaker city 

as he spoke a ghostly form glided from among the gay wayfarers of the side 
walk and stood by his side a ghostly form like a thin shape of mist with large 
dark eyes flashing from its shadowy face it is the old state house whisper 
ed the ghostly form in a voice that thrilled to the heart of the listener yes it 
f is old independence hall the lordlings of the quaker city have sold their 
fathervbones for gold they have robbed the widow and plundered the orphan 
blasphemed the name of god by their pollution of his faith and churchthey have 
turned the sweat and blood of the poor into bricks and mortar and now as the last 
 act of their crime they tear down independence hall and raise a royal palace 
 on its ruins j 

 what d ye mean by that cried devil-bug fiercely royal palace hey 
that means something about a king don t it 

king i echoed the ghost in a sad and sorrowful tone look at those proud 
chariots rolling along the crowded street look at those chariots with the horses 
decked in tinselled trappings and with liveried retainers riding at their sides 
yes yes i see em cried devil-bug in his coarse way them carriages 
ith horses all rigged out like circus horses an with fellers ridin along side 
ressed in monkey-jackets what does it all mean any how 

v those chariots are the equipages of a proud and insolent nobility who lord it 
over the poor of the quaker city yes there rides a duke and there a baron 
and yonder a count this palace is intended for the residence of a king liberty 
long since fled from the quaker city in reality has now vanished in its very name 
lt the spirit of the old republic is dethroned rnd they build a royal mansion over 
the ruins of independence hall 

as the spirit spoke the blaze of lights gre ore lojiant the sidewalk was 
thronged by gayer wayfarers the street resoi-nj to tne echo of chariot wheels 
and up to the clear sky like the echo of niagara went the hum and confusierv 
of ihe wide city 

ho ho laughed devil-bug so they git on quite lively do they stranger 
if i may axe sich a questi n whar is girard college hey 

tne eloquent eyes of the ghost lighted up with an expression of speechless woe 
they have torn it down to build this palace with its marble it answered in a 
tone of unutterable agony 

and what year d ye call this 

 the year of our lord one thousand dint hundred and fifty said the spirit 
but devil-bug was not sure that he had nearu bright it seemed to him afterward 
that the spirit had added a word to his enumeration of the time 

and this king whose palace is a-buildin yonder an these dukes and 
lords who are ridin in their big carri ges yonder what great deeds did ihey 
c ever do 

 cheated the poor out of their earnings wrung the bweat from the brow of the 
mechanic and turned it into gold traded away the bones of their fathers sold

independence square for building lots and built this palace for a king these 
ere their mighty deeds 

f it seems to me stranger that the king with his dukes an lords aint nothin 
out a pack o swindlin bank directors hey j in the year eighteen forty-two 
there was some fuss made about a monument to gin ral washington in washing 
ton square can you tell me stranger whatever became of it 

the ghost led him silently through the archway of the ruined state house 
and in a moment they stood upon independence square all cumbered with heaps 
of marble and piles of building timber the greater portion of the square was 
occupied by the royal palace but from the western extreme a free view of the 
heavens might be obtained 

 do you see that dark and gloomy building yonder exclaimed the ghost 
pointing in a south-western direction 

 what that great big jail of a buildin why stranger that stands where 
washin ton square used to stand what does it mean anyhow 

 it is indeed a gaol built on the ground of washington square within its 
gloomy cells all those brave patriots are confined the brave men who struck the 
last blow for the liberty of the land against the tyranny of this new-risen nobility 
there day after day and night after night with the rusted iron eating into their 
wasted flesh there they drag their lives away in darkness in cold and hunger 

 hello mister isn t that a gallows i see yonder opposite the jail it s quite 
comfortin to see that old-fashioned thing alive yet 

 it is a gallows said the ghost and thanks to the exertions of some of 
the holy ministers of god it is never idle day after day its rope is distended 
by the wriggling body of some murderer day after day these merciful preachers 
crowd around its blackened timbers sending the felon into the presence of his god 
his ears deafened by their hallelujahs while his stiffened hands grasp that bible 
whose code is mercy to all men 

 hurrah shouted devil-bug the gallons is livin yet hurrah 

 for some years it was utterly abolished said the ghost murders became 
few in number convicts were restored to society redeemed from their sins and 
the gaols began to echo to the solitary footsteps of the gaoler but these good 
preachers arose in the senate and the pulpit and plead beseechingly for blood 

 hurrah for the preachers them s the jockies 

 give us but the gibbet they shrieked only give us the gibbet and we ll 
reform the world christ said mercy was his rule we know more about his re 
ligion than he did himself and we cry give us blood in the name of moses in 
the name of paul and john and peter in the name of the church in the name 
of christ give us the gibbet only give us the gibbet 

 they said this the jolly fellers 

the gallows was given to them the gibbet arose once more in the streets 
murder become a familiar thing crime dyed its hands in blood and went laugh 
ing to the gibbet the good preachers plead for blood and they had it 

 hurrah screamed devil-bug the gallows is livin yet hurrah he 
sprang from his feet in very glee and clapped his hands and hurrahed again 

when he again looked round the ghost had disappeared retracing his steps 

through the archway devil-bug stood on the sidewalk of the broad street again 

he passed along among the crowds of gay wayfarers he passed many a princely 

equipage many a gorgeous chariot and here and there at the corners of the streets 



 erjte lat hag of the dkuafcer 

or among the gayest of the laughing thronge beheld a squalid beggar crouching 
to the earth as he asked for bread or a pale-faced mechanic in worn and tattered 
clothes who shook his hands in impotent rage as he beheld the stare of wealth 
which flashed from the lofty windows as if to tantalize him withuieir splendor 

at last devil-bug stood in front of a lofty marble church which arose from the 
centre of a grave-yard all around the massive church in the cold light of the 
stars arose long rows of whitened tomb-stones with here and there a lordly mon 
ument or slender obelisk or lofty pyramid of snow white marble 

devil-bug looked at the church intently for a few moments admiring its mas 
sive structure and expansive dome when to his utter astonishment the top of a 
vault near the wall of the grave-yard rose suddenly upward and through the aper 
ture a shrouded form issued in the star-light and stood erect lifting its hands to 
heaven while the death-shroud fluttered in the air 

suddenly the figure turned it advanced toward devil-bug he started in utter 
horror a ghastly corpse with eye of leaden dimness gazing fixedly from a face 
yellowed by decay stood before him and as he started in horror from each mar 
ble vault of the grave-yard from each rising mound from beneath each pyramid 
vand obelisk arose the shrouded form of a corpse and in an instant the place was 
white with the fluttering shrouds of the multitude of dead 

on they came advancing slowly toward the grave-yard wall on they came 
their hands crossed over their white shrouds their leaden eyes gazing fixedly 
forward their foreheads all alive with the loathsome grave-worm on they came 
gliding over the wall on they came a throng of the ghastly dead while devil- 
bug started aside in horror they glided over the grave-yard wall they mingled 
with the gay throngs of the side-walk their white shrouds fluttering amid silken 
gowns and velvet robes their ghastly faces seen among gay visages vacant with 
the joy of a pleasure-loving world 

devil-bug beheld them file along the street one by one a long and fearful 
train he saw them pass beneath he glare of the lights beneath the shadow of 
the palaces he saw them gliding slowly around their leaden eyes wearing that 
same fixed gaze while their hands were folded on their breasts vwith utter hor 
ror he discovered that the gay revellers of the street beheld them not they 
walked merrily round while the arisen dead glided all around them they smiled 
gaily unconscious of the leaden eyes that were gazing so sadly in their faces they 
rent the air with laughter unheeding the rustling sound of the thousand death- 
shrouds that swept the fringe of their costly robes 

oh what unutterable agony was painted upon the faces of the arisen dead as 
they discovered that the living beheld them not how their blue lips moved 
yet uttered no sound how their white hands were upraised as if in warning 
while the worms went crawling round each brow 

 what does this all mean shouted devil-bug in utter dismay good folks 
don t you see that the dead s among you good lady look there look there s 
a walkin corpse at yer shoulder fine gentleman look look there s a dead 
man at yer back look the whole grave yard is emptyin itself into the street 
look ye fools i say look 

he screamed and shouted as seized with an agony whose origin he could noi 
comprehend he felt himself forced to declare the awful spectacle which he beheld 
to the ears of the pleasure-loving citizens but he screamed and shouted in vain 

they heard him not the lord rolling by in his gilded equipage was uncon

-t 
ecious of the shrouded corpse that looked in his window the beggar in the guttei f 

knew not that the form of a friend long since dead was now gazing sadly upon - 
his misery 

devil-bug gazed far along the street and to his amazement heheld a long 
multitude of shrouded dead walking beneath the flaring lights as far as eye could 
see until the magnificent perspective was lost in a mass of vacant darkness 

 good folks shouted devil-bug in horror hello don t you see yer town 
is ajive with dead 

 let them alone let them alone said a mild and saddened voice 

bushing madly along the street devil-bug turned hurriedly around 

the pale ghost was at his side 

u 

 let them alone it cried in that low-toned voice the dead arise around 
them to warn them of their coming doom yet they know them not these are 
their friends their relatives their wives their sisters their brothers risen from 
the grave to warn them of their doom but their sealed eyes behold them not 

 their doom echoed devil-bug speak plain will ye what d ye mean 

behold cried the stranger pointing to a black cloud which arose from the 
blue in the western sky 

devil-bug looked and beheld written on the cloud words in letters of fire 
which he could not read 

 what does it mean he shrieked turning to the figure at his side 

 the angel of the judgment writes the doom of this proud city from the heavens 
his hand is extended behold the words of flame on yon glistening cloud 

wo unto sodom 

devil-bug looked upon these characters of flame and felt a strange awe pene 
trate his heart 

 come cried the ghost i will show you sights that no human eye may see 
i will unseal your ear to sounds that no human ear may hear 

devil-bug felt himself borne upward he felt himself hurried with the speed of 
wind along the crowded street 

and he was borne along from every grave-yard he beheld the shrouded dead 
arise beheld them pour out upon the thronged side-walk he saw them lift their 
hands on high he saw them fix their leaden eyes upon the faces of the living with 
a look of unutterable woe from lonely burial places from the banks of the 
broad river from the grounds of the prjson up started the shrouded dead nay 
from the very bricks of the crowded pavement they rose and joined the snow-white 
multitude who thronged the streets 

devil-bug and his guide stood at the foot of a gallows which arose like an 
evil omen upon the night the corpse of a convict hung in chains swung heavily 
to and fro as devil-bug looked the convict came down from his gibbet and 
clanking his chains on high with a hideous face festering with corruption and 
lighted by leaden eyes gleaming with all the malignity of hell the felon-corpse 
rushed by and joined the train of the dead 

through street after street through avenue after avenue devil-bug was borne 
by his ghastly guide but every wide street every avenue each pathway ana 
side- walk was crowded by throngs of laughing citizens mingling with the mult 
tudes of the shrouded dead 
 



 he hast has of the duattcr ettn 

 what does all this mean cried devil-bug to the ghost at his side 

 this night is a festival night with the lordlings of the city to-morrow thej 
qrill hold a grand revel through the whole extent of the wide town and to 
morrow 

the ghost paused it pointed to the lurid cloud over head with the letters of 
flame written on its darkness and as it pointed a sad smile stole over its lips an 
t whispered 

wo unto sodom 

 to-morrow shrieked the spirit to-morrow will be the last day of the qua 
ker city the judgment comes and they know it not 

as he spoke he set devil-bug down again in front of independence hall 
 listen to the song of the dead cried the ghost hark how they sing as they 
mingle with the crowds of light-hearted revellers hark how their low-toned 
song breaks like a funeral hymn on the air hark 

and as the shrouded dead glided along mingling unseen with the gay and liv 
ing there broke from their livid lips a fearful song uttered in a low and moaning 
chaurit that arose to the heavens in notes of prayer and execration 

a single voice pealing from among the dead moving along the street as they 
eang the solemn hymn prayed god to curse the quaker city 

then the whole legion of the dead shrieked in one horrible chorus wo unto 
sdom anathema marantha 

cursed be the city cried that solitary voice leading the supernatural choir 
 its foundations are dyed in blood the curse of the poor man is upon it and the 
curse of the orphan the widow with her babes starving at her breast raises hei 
hands and curses it in the sight of god wo unto sodom 

and the ghastly train extending far along the streets their stiffened hands 
folded upon their white shrouds took up the cry with their livid lips and chaunted 
in a low yet horrible tone 

 wo unto sodom wo anathema marantha 

 it has burned the churches of the living god it has torn his cross from 
the altar it has soiled his banner with dust and ashes even the graves of the 
dead it has not spared the hands of violence have torn the bones of the dead 
from their graves and flung them mockingly beneath the hoofs of the horses 
cursed be the city wo unto sodom 

 wo unto sodom the hour of doom draweth nigh the church of the liv 
ing god in ruins curses it the cross polluted and covered with ashes curses it 
the grave torn open by the hand of violence and the bones of the dead curse the 
city before the throne of god anathema marantha 

again that solitary voice resumed its chaunt of death and wo 
a the poor man toils in want and the rch man riots in his sweat and blood 
wo unto sodom the guiltless and the innocent pine in the dungeon while the 
unholy judge feasts upon the price of bribery and shame the corpse of the inno 
cent swings upon the gibbet and the worms crawl over its brow while the mur 
derer rides in his chariot his proud form clothed in fine linen and his guilty face 
decked in smiles accursed in the sight of god be sodom now and forever 

and all along the street from the ten thousand thousand dead arose tc 
response 



hast bag of the kuafcer utttg 

m amen accursed in the sight of god be sodom now and forever amen 
aid amen anathema marantha 

and thus in low arid solemn tones the solitary spirit recounted the foul litany 
of the city s crimes and as each hideous deed of wrong or murder fell from his 
livid lips the multitude of the dead raised up their voices and shrieked amen 
and amen accursed be sodom now and forever anathema marantha 

the curse seemed to pierce the ear of heaven from the sky shadowy forms 
of grandeur looked down upon the scene and suddenly a figure of awful and ma 
jestic beauty bent from the dim azure and waved a flaming sword across the 
heavens up to the sky like the blast of the last trumpet swelled the anathema 
of the arisen dead and from the blackness of the cloud overhanging the city like 
an embodied curse flashed the letters of doom wo unto sodom i 

 accursed be the city in the sight of nations it has torn the flag of freedom 
from the rock and dashed it in the dust 

 accursed be the city in the sight of god shrieked the voices of the dead 
 wo unto sodom anathema marantha 

and then they raised their leaden eyes to heaven and clenched their cold white 
hand on high and then their solemn chaunt was heard once more 

 accursed be the city before the throne of god it has torn the flag of free 
dom from the rock and trailed it in the dust wo unto sodom wo 

and through the streets they wound this ghastly multitude circling among 
the careless crowd their hands crossed on their breasts and their leaden eyes 
raised up to heaven and far far along each avenue they extended one awful train 
of shrouded dead moving slowly onward while around them swelled the hum and 
roar of the gay city holding its carnival 

and still up to the heavens arose the chaunt of the solitary voice and still like 
the thunder-blast of the last trump arose the dread response wo unto sodom 
amen and amen anathema marantha 

the scene changed suddenly devil-bug was borne upward through the air 
and the city passed from his view all was night and blackness and silence 

he looked around again and an exclamation of wonder burst from his lips he 
stood upon the portico of a proud palace which arose from the midst of a dark and 
angry river the palace was reared upon a solitary island which broke the fury 
of the waves in the centre of the river devil-bug looked to the west arid beyond 
the channel of the river he beheld the dim and dusky outlines of the magnificent 
city extending north and south in one dark mass of roofs and walls with here and 
there a heavy dome or towering steeple rising into the sky while from the lurid 
cloud overhead a strange light was flung upon the darkness of the scene and 
from that cloud hovering in mid-heaven that cloud so lurid so black and dismal 
from that mass of ominous darkness flashed the red-words of flame wo unto 
sodom 

all around the isle burst and foamed the waves of the swollen river the tor 
rent was choked with masses of ice and a rustling heaving sound went ever 
more up to the heavens 

looking to the west devil-bug beheld the black outlines of the city with the 
light from that fearful cloud playing upon its roofs and domes but as he gazed 
upon the east all was thick darkness with the broad waves of the river moaning 
and foaming in the blackness of the night here and there a towering wave 



 ante ast as of tue gutafcer ltttg 

rose uoavifig into view as it caught a faint gleam of light from the cloud abovi 
the far-off city but it suddenly sank again into the bosom of night and all wa a 
darkness thick as chaos 

as devil-bug standing on the roof of the palace gazed round in wonder the 
river became the scene of a strange and awful spectacle the waves were sud 
denly crowded by a fleet of coffins tossed wildly to and fro each coffin borne 
upon the surface of the waters like a boat with the foam dashing over its dull 
dark outlines and in each coffin sate a corpse with the death-shroud enfolding its 
limbs and waving along the blackness of the night while it urged its grave-boat 
merrily over the waters using a thigh-bone for an oar and at the foot of every 
coffin which served for the prow of the unearthly boat was a lurid light burning in 
a skull and flinging its radiance around over the waters over the faces of the dead 
and over the fluttering folds of each death-shroud ten thousand coffins each 
bearing its boatman in the form of a shrouded corpse floated on the surging waves 
of the river ten thousand lurid lights each flaring from the eyeless sockets of a 
skull gave a terrible radiance to the scene and the river far as the eye could 
t - see was crowded by this fleet of grave-boats with their shrouded oarsmen tossing 
 the water aside with the skeleton bone for an oar 

v devil-bug shouted aloud in the wildness of his glee ha ha ho ho there 
ttf was something so merry to his fancy in the spectacle of a broad river crowded by 
a fleet of coffins something so joyous in the light flaming from the orbless eyes 
of ten thousand skulls something so grotesque and horrible in shrouded corpses 
scattered over the surface of the river that devil-bug felt a strange frenzy of 
glee darting through his veins he raised his hands and shouted for very joy 

as devil-bug looked around in fiendish glee a new wonder met his gaze the 
fleet of coffins parted suddenly into two divisions and each division arrayed 
itself as if in the order of battle on the north from the island to the city over 
the surface of the waters extended one grim line of coffins with a livid corpse 
setting upright in each coffin and raising the skeleton bone aloft in the stiffened 
hand while their white shrouds waved like banners upon the night 

on the south with a broad path of waves between another grim line of coffins 
extended from the island to the river the white shrouds of the corpses borne aloft 
by the wind while ten thousand deathly hands swung the thigh-bone wildly over 
head in front of each line of coffins burned the lights flaring from the orbless 
eyes of a skull and now as the lurid rays gave strange radiance to the scene the 
faces of each corpse the leaden eyes the blue lips and the brow all green and 
clammy with decay became fired with deadly rage and beating the thigh-bone on 
the side of each coffin the antagonist lines of the dead began to move slowly to 
wards each other 

then an unearthly peal of music broke upon the air the music of the hollow 
skull echoing to the blow of the skeleton-bone from side to side it swelled it 
rose clanking to the heavens it deafened the ear of night with its infernal din 
nearer and nearer to each other the opposing lines of coffins drew faster and 
faster they glided over the waves wilder and more terrible swelled the music of 
the skeleton-bone and the skull 

now the opposing lines of the dead glared in each others faces now they raised 
their stiffened hands as if eager for the onset and waved their white shrouds if 
the air now a thin line of water lay between each division of the dead hiss- 



hast iag of the ltuatter ltitg 

mg and whirling and plunging the combatants drew near each other with a low 
muttered groan far more terrible than the loudest shout each party hailed the 
approach of its opponent and then with one deafening crash they closed together 
corpse fighting with corpse dead throttling dead coffin meeting with coffin 
each urged onward by the heaving waves each crashing madly into the prow of 
its antagonist while the dead arise and leaning over the side of their death-boats 
they reach forth their arms and grasp each other in the clutch of an infernal hate 
then how the fires flaring from the orbless eyes of skulls danced to and fro now 
the river grew alive with the white robes of shrouds fluttering on the air with the 
gleam of lights hissing as they sank beneath the waters with that horrible groan 
of the corpse as it fought with its fellow corpse 

then how merrily the music of the skeleton-bone and the hollow skull shrieked 
over the waters and mingling with the low-muttered groans of ten thousand thou 
sand corpses rose echoing to the heavens above then crash upon crash with 
horrible yells of laughter the shrouded dead again urged their coffins full upon 
each other and fought like living men upon a battle-field with ghastly faces 
mouldering with corruption yet fired by all the passions of life upturned to the 
sky with the waves rearing and plunging all around them with their shrouds 
tossing madly on the air while the skull-fires danced to and fro they closed together 
in terrible combat and fought amidst the howling of the waters 

another peal of the skeleton-bone and the skull another wild burst of laughter 
like a flash of lightning the scene was changed 

the river was calm as the joy of the saint first awakening from the sleep of 
the grave into the peace of god s own sweet rest pure serene and placid it 
lay like a mirror before the eyes yet still in the sky overhead hung the cloud 
with its letters of flame wo unto sodom still from the letters of flame a lurid 
light fell over the waters now so calm and tranquil and the dark mass of walls 
and roofs which marked the position of the city with the lofty steeples and proud 
domes steeped in livid light was reflected in the calm waters like a magnificent 
picture delineated by some unearthly hand 

and along the calm waters marched a long and winding column of the dead 
gliding over the bosom of the river their stiffened feet but touching the smooth 
surface while their solemn faces were upraised to the sky and their white 
shrouds fell in drooping folds around their awful forms gliding over the waters 
two abreast a long column of the dead their ghostly figures mirrored in the 
depths below they sang a low-toned and solemn song 

oh how its notes of awful tenderness and feeling floated on the still air how 
that soft melody filled all space and breathed forth upon the universe like a per 
fume from eternal flowers softly and gently it floated over the river that wild 
and bewitching lament for the dead now it died sadly away until a whisper of 
deep and absorbing melody was all that broke upon the silence of night then 
loud and louder it rose it filled the sky and like a chorus of angel- voices seemed 
to hold earth and heaven enchained with its deathless song 

it was a lament for the dead it was a lament for the dead who were to die on 
the morrow it was a lament for young maidens for grey-haired and helpless 
men for smiling and sinless babes all were to be mingled in the destruction 
of the morrow all were to share the doom and the death of the last day of the 
guilty and idolatrous city 



arhe hast hag of the uafter 

the lament wept its tears of melody for them the young and beautiful jt wept 
for grey-haired age it wept for smiling innocence 

c suddenly its notes changed from sadness to joy joy to the captive in his cell 
s joy to the sick man on his couch joy to the felon who was to die on the morrow 
r joy to thejxgtor ohjoy their day was come at last the rich with their pur 
ple and fine linen had enjoyed the world long enough now the god of the poor 
would arise in his might and crush the lordlings under the heel of his power 
- what cared the poor if they too shared the ruin was it not triumph to see 
the rich and corrupt dragged down from their high places was it not triumph 
worth all the deaths in hell 

therefore the band of shrouded dead winding over the smooth surface of the 
river sang joy to the poor joy to hunger joy to starvation misery and wo joy 
to ye all your god arises his arm is uplifted already the rumbling of his 
fchariot wheels draw near no more hunger now no more crying for bread 
no more huddling down in squalor and want and cold the avenger comes 
shout ye poor shout from your factories and work-benches from your huts and 
dens of misery shout hail to the last day of the guilty and blood-stained city

as the last echo of the song broke on the air the forms of the dead their moul- 
dering faces and their white shrouds faded slowly from the view and the day bc- 
ltgan to dawn in the east the last day of the doomed city streaking the east 
with faint grey and then with soft crimson and then with purple and gold the 
day arose upon the river and the city devil-bug looked for the cloud it was 
gone gone with its letters of flame the night with its phantoms was over 
and now the day came on the awful day preceded by that night of omen and 
prophecy the last day of the doomed city all hail 

the laughing waves of the river caught the red gleam of the rising sun and 
ihe proud domes shone like masses of burnished silver and the steeples rose glit 
tering in the sky 

devil-bug beheld the sun arise in grandeur he saw the stars fading away be 
fore the day-god slowly and solemnly as they looked their last glance upon the 
beautiful earth he gazed upon the blue sky and marked the flashes of purple and 
gold warming upward to the very zenith it was a glorious day this last day of 
ten thousand years of blood and crime the air was freshening and balmy 
although it was winter and the broad river rippled in innumerable tiny waves 
caught the sunbeam on its transparent surface and smiled in welcome of the 
rising day 

as devil-bug gazed around the palace on which he stood sank suddenly be 
neath him like a rock hurled from some dizzy height it sank one moment its 
towers gleamed in the light the next instant a small narrow and barren islet 
uprising from the waves like the back of some huge ocean monster assumed the 
place of the gorgeous fabric the palace was gone and a flood of sun-light poured 
over the river where its shadow but a moment before had darkened the waves 

devil-bug was suddenly lifted from the isle by invisible hands and borne across 
the waters towards the mighty city the waves laughing beneath him and the 
clea sunshine around he was borne slowly onward as he glided through the 
air a strange wonder met his gaze on the surface of the river floated a solitary 
coffin containing a stiffened corpse whose white shroud and ashen face lay oper 
to the warm gold of the sun-beams while its fixed and leaden eyes gazed stead 
fastlv upon the sky

 ha ha shrieked devil-bug it s the corpse of lorrimer hurrah a 
strange glee animated his breast as his loud laugh broke upon the air the corpse 
arose in its coffin and flung the folds of its white shroud to the winds it tossed 
its arms on high and echoed the glee of the dreamer with a ghastly laugh then 
borne onward by the tiny waves the coffin floated own the river a low mut 
tered chaunt broke from the lips of the corpse and then sitting erect with the 
white shroud fluttering on the winds it went sailing merrily over the waves 

 hurrah cried devil-bug it s the corpse of lorrimer hurrah 

as his laugh shrieked along the winter air the river and the coffin with its 
corpse rushed from his view he stood in the streets of the wide city once again 
and the awful drama which formed the soul of his dream wore on to its last scene 

the streets of the doomed city were utterly deserted devil-bug wandered 
up and down but gained no sight of a human face a strange panic seemed to 
have laid hold of the denizens of the proud town they kept within the shelter 
of their homes the lord within his mansion the king within his palace the beggar 
within his hut the streets were deserted by the living and yet up and down 
the wide avenues glided the white bands of the countless dead up and down the 
wide avenues evermore and unceasing their cold white hands crossed on their 
breasts and their leaden eyes glaring steadily forward glided the corpses of the 
night before and the warm sunlight shone full upon their ghastly faces upon 
the livid lips and the discolored cheeks their leaden eyes o merciful god 
how fixed and and ghastly was their glare ttheir leaden eyes were turned to 
horrible gold the loathsome worms crawling around each forehead glistened 
gaily in the light and wreathed a hideous coronet of death upon each festering 
brow 

devil-bug passed along amid these shrouded forms he passed along unheeding 
their ghastly faces and their frozen looks he had grown used to these sights 
of horror he passed swiftly onward noting the grandeur and magnificence of 
the streets the temples of marble the mansions of towering splendor the churches 
with their lofty steeples and the halls of pleasure with their glittering domes 

and as he passed along he noted with strange awe a new omen of the day the 
towering mansions along the wide streets were sinking slowly into the earth 
slowly and almost imperceptibly inch by inch they were sinking into the hard 
ground wherever devil-bug passed this wonder met his gaze in narrow 
alleys and in spacious streets the same fearful spectacle was exhibited the wide 
town was sinking slowly into the bosom of the earth 

suddenly the streets became alive with people from obscure huts in lonely 
alleys and from lordly palaces along far vista-ing streets from quiet dwellings 
and from gorgeous mansions poured the contrasted multitude it was a gala-day 
in tne city it was the anniversary of the death ojffreedom the king was to be flt 
crowned and the multitude were gathered in grand procession to swell his triumph 

devil-bug stood in front of the ruins of independence hall along the wide 
street as far as eye might behold was one living sea of banners and plumes 
bayonets and spears horses with glittering trappings and gallant riders were 
speeding to and fro armed bands thronged the streets there were chariots all 
glistening with cloth of gold there were long files of liveried retainers there wero 
proud lords glittering in purple and jewels and enthroned on a royal seat perched 
on the summit of a splendid structure a mimic temple borne on wheels and drawn 
by milk-white steeds above the gleam of spears and the flutter of banners sate 
the king he looked to the blue heavens and smiled it was such a glorious 



 srtie lact hag of the ltauafcer 

day he was to be crowned again in honor of the anniversary of his triumph 
the sun-shine streamed over his dark and swarthy face the breeze played with 
the ringlets of his jet-black hair 

the king glanced over the living sea and smiled again the heaven above 
was the only space that met his eyes that was not occupied by banners and 
plumes stern visages and merry faces from thp roof to the gutters on either 
side of the wide street all was glitter and show fair forms crowded the lofty 
windows and white hands flung showy scarfs upon the air aged matrons lifted 
little children upon high and pointing toward the throne bade them look upon 
the king white bosoms rose heaving in the sun at the sight of his stern 
majesty bright eyes glanced upon him in pride along the roofs of the houses 
along the side-walks of the street clinging to the pillars of the uprising palace 
nay over the ruined walls of independence hall gathered the dense multitude 
young and old rich and poor gazing with fixed interest upon the triumph of 
their king purple and rags grey-hairs and cherry lips smiling foreheads and 
wrinkled cheeks all were mingled in strange contrast 

it was a grand day and a glorious sight that sky of blue that cheerful sun 
that long vista of palaces and pillared mansions that dense mass of people that 
glittering array of spears and plumes and banners with the proud king sitting 
enthroned above all 

the procession began to move first came the music rending the air with its 
martial joy the peal of bugle the roll of drum and the clang of cymbols huzza 
how that cheer of the mob shrieked up to the sky then came the banner- 
knight surrounded by throngs of brave warriors and riding on a milk-white steed 
his firm arm swung aloft the red banner of the city with the crown and his 
chain emblazoned on its folds huzza another cheer from the mob at the 
sight of the crown and chain then solid files of soldiers were tramping by r 
their bayonets gleaming in the light their plumes waving in the air then came 
the temple drawn by milk-white-steeds and the king sitting on the throne 
raised his glance to the heavens while his proud lip curled in scorn he de 
spised the multitude whose necks were under his feet 

and at this moment as his eye was fixed upon the heavens while the proudest 
jewel in his crown shone like a meteor in the light of the sun at his very 
shoulder stood a ghastly corpse its stiffened limbs folded in a white shroud its 
dull dead eyes fixed upon his visage the visage of the king he saw it not 
there there upon the summit of the temple beside his very crown it stood but 
he saw it not its clammy visage was all alive with hideous grave-worms and 
its fearful eye was gazing sadly into his own into the proud eye of the king 
but he saw it not 

nor did the vast crowd of living men behold the dead multitude as it mingled 
with them and crowded away their ranks nor did the soldiers tramping in 
pride behold the files of dead men marching amid the glory of their banners all 
uniformed in deathly shrouds yes yes on every side gathered the legions of the 
shrouded dead amid the ranks of the procession in the lofty windows along the 
eide- walks on the roof tops and on independence hall they gathered that band 
of countless dead 

devil-bug beheld them he alone of all that innumerable crowd beheld the 
corpses in their shrouds he beheld them tnd laughed in glee it was a sight of 
glorr a sight of maddening glory to the king as he looked over the soldiers but 



she ut idag of tnc ltaiiafcer orctg 

the corpse at his side with its dull dead leaden eyes fixed upon his face ah ha 
he saw it not it raises its arm it places its stiffened hand upon the shoulder of 
the king he feels no pressure of the cold dead fingers but looks upon the 
iving crowd ands miles 

devil-bug laughed until his sides ached again an old and withered man 
standing at his side looked up at the sound of that wild laugh and devil-bug 
felt the glance of a cold grey eye fixed upon his face 

 why dc you tough said the old man in a deep and mournful voice know 
fou not liberty is buried to day this is her funeral 

devil-bug laughed loudly yet again and pointed to the procession with its 
omp and banners 

 that s why i laugh he cried only look at the crown and chain and 
en look at independence hall ho ho ho 

the old man drew him aside into a dark corner under his arm he carried 
it huge port-folio 

i m an antiquary he said in that low-toned and mournful voice i gather 
up the relics of the past 

 a sort o cur osity-monger suggested devil-bug 

 look here whispered the old man be careful that no one sees you 
t will cost you your life look there 

he placed a piece of damp cloth in the hands of devil-bug 

devil-bug gazed upon it with some interest he unrolled it and threw its 
colors alas how faded and tarnished he threw its colors open to the glare of the 
day it was an old banner an old banner with thirteen crimson stripes and 
twenty nine white stars emblazoned on a blue field 

 ho ho chuckled devil-bug why this is the merykin flag 

 that was the american flag said the grey-eyed antiquary 

 was echoed devil-bug 

 was the american flag i say there is no america now in yonder 
ruined hall america was born she grew to vigorous youth and bade fair to live 
to a good old age but alas alas jjshe was massacred by her pretended 
friends priest-craft and slave-craft and traitor-craft were her murderers and 
now a poor old antiquary has to skulk like an assassin through the street because 
he has discovered a relic of the olden time and bears it with him this pro 
scribed and forbidden flag 

the old man bowed his head 

 ho ho yonder s the purty banner with the crown and the chain 
hurrah i 

as devil-bug laughed in his frenzied glee the old man concealed the flag in 
the port folio under his arm and walked silently away 

the procession came sweeping by in all its royal pomp after the temple 
with its throne and king came the sacred clergy in all the pride of priestly 
robes and godly faces walking four by four they talked eagerly together 
and disputed with great force and energy upon subjects of grave import va 
rious banners marked their various creeds one fat-faced parson swung aloft a 
banner of white witn a grim gibbet pictured on its folds hurrah the mob 

yelled in grateful applause at the sight the gibbet and the good old gallow a 

j aw tliey shouted the gibbet and gallow s law forever 



 the last hag of the 

 then came another preacher with lanthern-jaws and an eye liks a milture 

ishp he swung aloft a banner of sable dark as midnight with eternal death engt 

 blazoned in its da k surface in lively letters hurrah hurrah that mob waa 

a pure old fashioned orthodox mob eternal death forever they shrieked 

eternal death in the next world for every soul that disbelieves in our creed 

and in this world the fire and faggot for all heretics hurrah 

and among the dark bands of the sacred clergy walked the shrouded dead 
looking into the godly faces of the reverend men with that fixed stare of their 
leaden eyes there was a corpse at the side of each doctor of divinity a 
ghastly dead man at the shoulder of each oily priest and they trooped on with 
their black robes and their banners and then the ministers of justice drew nigh a 
glorious band a figure of justice done in gilt upon a black ground floated like 
a bird of omen above their heads by their sides walked dark-faced miscreants 
with whips and manacles in their hands and a long line of penniless debtors 
with staved forms and wan faces brought up the rear jrlurrah hurrah that 

was a lusty cheer a laylpjunp mob was this old laws and judges who 

have an eye for their friends they shouted justice with a bandage over her 
eyes so thick that gold alone can make her see clear hurrah hurrah 
fl then came the slaves of the city white and black marching along one 
mass of rags and sores and misery huddled together a goodly tail to the proces 
sion of the king chains upon each wrist and want upon each brow here 
 they were the slaves of the cotton lord and the factory prince above their heads 
 loom of iron rising like a gibbet in the air and by their sides the grim over 
seer hurrah hurrah this is a liberal mob it encourages manufactures 
the monopolist forever they yelled his enterprize gives labour to the poor 
hurrah hurrah the slaves lifted up their eyes at the sound of that tumultous 
hurrah and muttered to each other of glad green fields and a farmer s life and 
then they clanked their chains together and gazed at the ruins of independence 
hall 

so they went trooping by the slaves of the cotton lord and the factory 
prince and at their sides and among their ranks walked the unseen forms of 
the shrouded dead for them the manacled and the lashed for them the slaves 
of capital and trade the grim faces of the dead wore a smile look up brothers 
they muttered in their awful tones the day of your redemption draweth near 
this is the last day of your toil the slaves heard them not but gazing madly 
upon the ruins of independence hall went sadly on 

suddenly a dim faint murmur burst from the ranks of the procession 

a murmur as faint and dim arose from the side-walk from the windows and 
the house-tops devil-bug looked around in wonder every face grew suddenly 
white a strange and awful fear had descended upon the hosts of the king and 
the crowds of spectators rushing to the head of the procession devil-bug looked 
upon the face of the king it was ashy 

he turned to his soldiers he turned to his subjects he shrieked aloud in horror 
and at that very moment ten thousand thousand eyes beheld the object of the 
monarch s terror at his side stood a ghastly corpse with worms crawling round 
its brow and dull leaden eyes animate with a horrid light like a gleam from 
bell 



flast hag of the ltuafeer otttg 

one shriek went up to god from that vast crowd one shriek of horror every 
eye beheld the corpse at the side of the king and now oh god of judgment 
every man in all that countless crowd beheld the form of a grim dead man at 
his side how the shriek of horror rushed up at the clear sky like thunder from 
hell yes yes every man beheld the form of a corpse at his side every woman 
saw the leaden eyes gazing upon her beauty the very babes beheld the awful 
spectacle and hid their heads in their mother s bosoms and mingled their shrill 
cry of horror with the shriek of the millions 

the film had fallen from their eyes they knew that the dead walked among 
them they knew that the last day was upon them in blackness and fear the 
priests cast aside their banners and grovelled in the dust they shrieked for 
mercy to that god whose name had been blasphemed by their every act and word 
with a clanking sound ten thousand muskets and swords and spears rolled 
upon the ground the warriors too were on their knees but they looked upon 
the sky not in imbicile fear but with a stern and awfiil agony then the shrieks 
of the women the wild yells of the crowd the horrible anguish of old men 
tearing their grey hair in very agony there there with them and among 
them and around them glided the forms of the dead with their ghastly eyes 
and their long white shrouds 

above the sky was clear the sun was radiant azure and serene the heavens 
were undimmed by a cloud the king looked up and folded his arms while the 
cold sweat trickled down his brow he set his stern lips together and muttered a 
curse upon his god at the very instant from the clear sky leapt a bolt of red 

thunder the king lay on the earth a blackened corpse then the long line 

of houses began to sink into the earth slowly slowly inch by inch like ships at 
sea with the waves creeping over their decks then from the earth burst streams 
of vapor hissing and whirling as they spouted upward into the blue sky around 
each pillar of vapor in an instant there lay a circle of blackened corpses that 
steam smote the living to the heart it withered their eye-balls it crisped the 
flesh on their bones like the bark peeling from the log before the flame 

then from the sky so clear so serene leapt ten thousand bolts of red thunder 
each bolt striking the earth with a fierce hissing sound and laying the living 
along its path a heap of blackened and a festering dead then the earth began 
to heave like the ocean in a storm and waves of solid ground rose up to the clear 
heavens bearing palaces and domes and steeples on their crests 

a storm on the land waves of solid earth billows crested with domes and steep 
les with myriads of human beings hanging like foam on the top of each wave 
and billow huzza 

columns of hot vapor rising from the heaving earth ten thousand thousand 
columns winding upward to the clear blue sky with a circle of blackened dead 
thrown in one huddled mass around each hissing column huzza huzza then 
the shrieks and the groans and the low muttered thunder echoing from the 
bosom of each earthly wave 

then the fair women tossed in the air clasping their babes in their arms aa 
they were dashed in fragments on the earth the old men and the bright-eyed 
youth all mingled together in the massacre of judgment 

devil-bug beheld it all and was not harmed an invisible hand bore him on 
through the heaps of bleeding dead over the waves of tossing earth on and on 
unscathed and without harm he heard the crash of one wave crested with 



 tte last ha of the 



tempes meeting another with the mass of human beings tossed from its summit 
like foam-sparkles from a brooklet s ripple he heard the cries of despair and 
over all he beheld the smiling sky 

he felt himself borne suddenly aloft on the crest of one long and tremendous 
oillow of solid earth high above the ruin high above the universe of that 
city s woe it rose it shot upward into the sky it remained fixed in the air an 
awful column of trembling earth with its crumbling peak tenanted by three 
living beings besides devil-bug 

a father and his child and the lover of that child the father standing on 
the summit of this dizzy column tore his grey hairs in very despair as he beheld 
the city rocking to and fro at its base the daughter clung to his knees her 
long golden hair waving in the sunbeams and her large blue eyes upturned to 
his face the lover with a dark eye gazing on the sky and jet-black hair damp 
with the beaded sweat trickling from his brow he cowered to the earth of that 
fearful isle he howled in imbecile agony devil-bug looked upon the scene 
witn a strange pleasure there they were perched on the summit of that dizzy 
column that column of solid earth thrown upward into the air by the wave which 
had tossed them aloft there they were alone in that world of death 

below them and around them rocked the city its temples tossed like autumn 
leaves by the wind its uncounted myriads of human beings mingled in one awful 
massacre 

then the earth began to crumble from the edges of the column and far far 
below whirling first to one side and the other the hard lumps of solid clay were 
tossed like wounded birds upon the breeze the father moaned and gathered 
the blue-eyed girl closer to his knees but the lover - devil-bug laughed in 
glee as he beheld the dastard act the lover rose with a mad shriek and seized 
the maiden in his arms 

 down he cried tossing her aloft there is room but for one upon this 
isle down 

the old man caught him by the throat he tore the girl from his arms and 
then battling over her prostrate form for a foothold on that dizzy column s sur 
face they grappled together and fought like devils the old man s eyes start 
ed from his withered face and the lover seized his cheek between his teeth and 
howled like a hyena rushing on a corpse devil-bug beheld the scene and yet 
by some strange influence maintained his foothold on the rock the old man 
gathered the lover in his arms he tossed him wildly aloft he sprung from the 
eery isle how their folding bodies went down through the clear air with a 
sound like the whizzing of birds upon the airy the fair girl raised herself from 
her prostrate position she gazed over the edge of the crumbling column 
oh god what an awful space lay between that column s summit and the rocking 
earth she raised herself upon her feet she tossed her golden hair upon the 
 wind she looked to the blue sky with outspread arms she leaped toward the 
radiant sun with a wild shriek i come she cried then down to the 
heaving wreck of the city like a dove wounded by the hunter s shaft plunging 
through the still air she fell devil-bug was alone upon the surface of the awful 
column alone with that utterable sight seen far below 

he raised his hands aloft he flung them in the air with a shriek of inferna 
flee

and then right over his head dusky and black gathered the cloud of tne nighl 
before like the raven corpse of the dead and in its awful surface was written 
the words of flame and a ghastly voice whispered their meaning to the air 

wo unto sodom 

again like a spirit reigning over the evil which he had wrought devil-bug 
raised his hands and laughed in glee 

 look below cried the ghastly voice speaking from the still air look far 
below and behold the wreck of the doomed city temples and domes heaps of 
dead and piles of solid earth mingled in one awful ruin the river burdened 
with blackened corpses and the bright sky watching smilingly over all look 
and behold the massacre of judgments the sacrifice of justice the wronga 
of ages are avenged at last at last the voice of blood crying from the very 
stones of the idolatrous city has pierced the ear of god look beneath and look

justice shout the amen to the litany of tbe city s crime shout wo

the second day 



ravoni the sorcerer 

chapter first 

od just 

the night drew near its close from the dark azure of the sky the cold 
winter stars shone down over the streets of the silent city 

at that moment when the night had yet an hour to run when the morn 
ing dawn was yet an hour distant in two chambers of the slumbering town 
removed from each other by the space of a mile were progressing scene 
fraught with a deep and solemn interest 

in one chamber was mystery and gloom in the other was poverty and 
death in one chamber was priestly guilt bargaining with sorcery for the 
downfall of purity and virtue in the other a ruined woman lay while 
starvation and suicide stood watching by her couch c lv s 

first we draw the veil from the chamber of the sorcerer 

it was an hour before the dawn of morning on the night of friday the 
twenty-third of december when two figures came walking slowly and care 
lessly along one of the prominent streets near the heart of the city 

a solitary lamp illumined the pavement near the centre of a massive 
block of towering mansions for a few feet around the lamp was thrown 
a vivid and ruddy light while all beyond and above was shadow starlight 
and the heavy obscurity which falls upon the night before the dawn of day 
the figures paused for a moment in the light of the lamp 

parson do you believe in a god said a voice rendered indistinct and 
husky with wine 

 why to tell you the truth fitz i ve preached about that particular be 
lief frequently quite frequently so often in fact that i ve forgotten what 
is my especial faith on that point 

and with a bland smile the godly dr pyne gazed upon the swarthy 
countenance of fitz-cowles 

 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 quite drunk he muttered to himself with a pleasant chuckle has 
quite a snake in his hat a perfect viper of a snake 

because if you do believe in a god returned fitz-cowles endeavoring 
to maintain possession of a particular brick near the lamp-post i d just 
thank you to name him for parson hear me now you fat old do i 
swear by that god to have the girl before another day goes over my head 

fitz-cowles struck his gold-headed cane against the lamp-post while the 
parson seemed to enjoy the scene with a vast fund of good humor 

 that was very good wine we drank in the cellar eh fitz 

 the devil take you and the wine i was talking of the girl 

 oh you was was you and youm like to have her 

 don t grin that way again parson or i ll knock you down i will have 
her eh have her before another sun goes over over my 

 hat suggested the parson with a wide grin 

 head curse your head roared fitz-cowles hello what old build 
ing is this 

fitz-cowles started backward toward the curb as he spoke and placing 
his conical hat on the end of his cane took a quiet though half-drunken 
survey of the building 

it was an old-fashioned structure four stories in height with a massive 
hall door in the centre and a multitude of windows on either side the sur 
face was a bright yellow this fact by itself was sufficient to excite the 
j attention of a wayfarer for in the quaker city the eye is wearied by one 
 unvarying sameness of dull red brick the man who paints a house blue 
 or yellow or pink or white or any other hue in fact than this monotonous 
red is incontinently set down by his neighbours as slightly weak-minded or 
positively crazy 

in addition to this striking peculiarity the house was marked by several 
other characteristics well adapted to excite the wonder of a citizen or a 
stranger the windows were numerous but each window was small and 
cramped in size with its dingy white shutters hermetically sealed the 
roof was flat the cornices around the eves massive and the hall door ap 
proached by a flight of time-worn marble steps the mansion was separated 
from the adjoining houses by a narrow alley on either side whose darkness 
the light of the lamp could not penetrate 

 that s what i call a venerable structure exclaimed fitz-cowles main 
taining his position on the curb-stone with a gentle see-saw motion it 
looks as though it were one of the town residences of that respectable old 
gentleman the wandering jew dammit parson what s it used for 

parson pyne smiled pleasantly as he replied in an unctuous whisper- - 
 the uses of that house are three-fold fitz-cowles in the first place 
 curse your first places you ain t in the pulpit now old boy 
gt it is a mad-house whispered dr pyne 

 ha ejaculated fitz-cowles with a vacant stare 



god is just 

 it is a dissecting hall continued the fat parson 

 a what cried the drunken millionaire 

 and it is a sorcerer s den exclaimed pyne with deep emphasis 

 hello ejaculateditz-cowles you don t say that and who is 
the mad doctor the dissector and the sorcerer is their names smith or 
tones or miller 

 did you never notice on chestnut street on a sun-shiny aflernoon a 
slight thin individual rather well built but with a stoop in his gait he 
dresses in a dark cloth over-coat rather profusely adorned with furs and 
wears his hair long and lank about his shoulders his face is yellow as a 
guinea but he has an eye like a devil incarnate do you know the man 

fitz-cowles raised his gold-headed cane slowly to his lips at that mo 
ment he presented a finished picture of drunken wisdom 

 he is called a signior is he not a signer or a don or a prince 
 the same well this sallow-faced gentleman in the furred dress and the 
dark eyes is the mad-doctor the dissector and the sorcerer 

 it seems to me that i should like to have a little conversation with the 
old boy exclaimed fitz-cowles aiming a blow at a particular brick with 
the end of his cane is he visible at this hour 

dr pyne raised his hand suddenly to his forehead i have it he 
muttered between his teeth i must get rid of this fellow without delay 
look ye fitz-cowles he exclaimed aloud we must part for the night 
by to-morrow at noon i will place this girl in your power there is mv 
hand on it good-night 

and he strode hurriedly down the street 

 that s what i call cool muttered fitz-cowles with a drunken leer as 
he strode away from the lamp in an opposite direction ha ha he 
chuckled to himself has a sallow face and a devil s eye ha hee be 
tn my power to-morrow at noon hurrah 

in a moment the millionaire was lost to view in the darkness and the fat 
form of dr pyne emerged from a neighboring alley and ascended the mar 
ble steps of the old mansion 

he rang the bell in silence there was a long and weary pause and the 
sound of a key turning the lock was heard one of the pannels of the mas 
sive door receded and a dingy black hand was thrust through the crevice 
dr pyne took a small piece of green paste-board from his pocket and after 
glancing for an instant at the strange characters scrawled upon its surface 
he placed it within the grasp of the sable hand which immediately disap 
peared there was a pause for a moment and then the door was opened 
and a negro dressed in green livery beckoned the parson to enter in an 
instant dr pyne stood at the end of a long and narrow hall illumined by a 
single lamp suspended near its centre with its farther extreme occupied by 
the steps of a massive stair- way 
 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

the negro in livery locked the door and then folding his arms across hit 
breast stood before the parson motionless as a statue 

 is your master in said dr pyne 

the negro made no reply 

 d n the nigger muttered the parson he must be addressed by 
his proper name or else he will not answer avar i would see the signior 
ravoni 

the negro mute waved his hand toward the stair-way and slowly led the 
way along the hall as they passed under the lamp dr pyne started with 
involuntary disgust the full ugliness of the negro s face broke upon him 
at a glance the mute did not observe the start but silently led the way 
up the thickly carpeted stairs and along a dark and gloomy entry the 
negro opened the door which turned on its hinges without the slightest ap 
proach to a sound and the rev dr pyne entered the den of the signior 
ravoni 

as he stepped over the threshold the door was closed and he was alone 
with the sorcerer he looked around and an involuntary feeling of awe 
gathered round his heart 

it was a spacious chamber lined along its firm walls with thick folds of 
dark velvet at one end the dreary uniformity of the velvet was broken by 
a massive mirror which enclosed in a glittering frame reached half way 
from the ceiling to the floor the ceiling was painted black and the floor 
concealed by a sable carpet gave no echo to the footstep 

in front of the mirror seated beside a table covered with black cloth with 
the light of a small lamp falling over his sallow face and dark robes the 
signior ravoni sate silent and motionless his pale white hand tracing lines 
on a sheet of paper while his head was downcast and his long dark hair 
hung carelessly about his neck and shoulders 

he raised his head slowly from the manuscript and his large dark eyes 
were fixed upon the face of the clergyman 

 who is it that seeks audience with the signior ravoni he said in a 
deep sepulchral voice 

there was something so calm so dignified yet spectral and unearthly in 
the manner and tone of this singular man that dr pyne was awed into 
silence for a few moments at last shaking off the feeling of superstitious 
fear which began to creep over him he advanced and laid the green card 
upon the table 

 this was given to me by lector he said naming a celebrated 

surgeon of the quaker city he is one of your friends and pupils he 
informed me that you were skilled in the treatment of the insane 

 you seek the advice of the signior ravoni interrupted the voice of the 
signior 

 i nave a daughter began dr pyne ravoni motioned him to a seat r 

 pronounced aa-twzr with the accent on the final syllable 



god is just 

and then resting his sullen cheek upon his pale hand he fixed the glance of 
his large dark eyes upon the face of the priest and listened in silence to his 
story 

their interview continued for the space of half an hour when the parson 
took the pen from the table and wrote a few lines on a slip of paoer 

 this will settle the matter he cried with one of his satyr-like smile 

 arrange this business and the money is yours 

a gleam of contempt flashed from the dark eyes of ravoni 

 it shall be done he said as he rose from his seat 

the door was flung suddenly open and a loud laugh burst upon the air 

 ua ha doctor i ve come to steal that corpse for you shouted a 
ndugh voice iv e come to steal the dead body- hurray 

well was it for dr pyne that he sank behind the table as the sound of 
that voice broke on his ear 

for in the centre of the chamber stood devil-bug the door-keeper of 
monk-hall every line of his distorted countenance quivering with a wild 
expression akin to madness while his solitary eye dilated and flashed like 
phosphorus gleaming through the orbless socket of a skull 

 iv e had sich dreams he shouted dashing the thick hair aside from his 
protuberant brow sich dreams o death an hell that i could murder a 
man jest now for the wery fun o th thing 

 did yo say i was to steal a dead body to-night doctor by i 
could steal a grave-yard of em 

the expressive lip of ravoni curled in scorn 

 is the day drunk or crazy he muttered with that slight foreign accent 
which marked his speech slave he cried advancing with his arm out 
stretched how dare you cross that threshold unbidden 

his sallow face grew animate with contemptuous indignation every 
muscle of his countenance quivered his lip trembled with scorn his eye 
brows were joined in a withering form 

a strange magnetic gleam darted from his eyes he waved his white 
hand in the air with a gesture of command 

devil-bug endeavored to brave that look but in vain there was a jar 
ful magnetic power in the glance of those large dark eyes he felt himself 
drawn toward them he felt the control of his limbs the mastery of his 
immense strength passing from him like a dream 

 to your knees whispered the deep tones of ravoni to your knees 
dog am i not your master 

the glance of those eyes was upon the monster impelled by an unknown 
influence which darted from their unutterable lustre devil-bug walked 
tremblingly along the floor and crouched at the feet of ravoni like a spaniel 
at the call of his master and there clinsinff bv each hand to the feet of 

o o j 

ravoni he still fixed his gaze upon the lustre of the full dark eyes which 
held him prisoner and this when one single blow of his iron hand might 

 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

have crushed the man who stood before him into a shapeless mass of c ay 
it was a sublime spectacle the triumph of an intellect over the brute and 
the savage 

as devil-bug crouched spaniel-like at the feet of the signior ravoni dr 
pyne stole from his hiding place and slunk away from the room 

 brave me thus but once again whispered ravoni gazing steadily upon 
the monster at his feet and i will take from you the power to think or act 
without my consent my will shall be yours your brute strength shall 
be mine yes yes he added in a muttered whisper by one fixed ex 
ertion of my brain i can make my will the soul of this mass of savage 
strength 

 master whined devil-bug still crouching on the floor do with me 
what you like ask me to steal dead bodies or set fire to a house or murder 
a man in broad day an i ll do it 

ravoni smiled and motioned devil-bug to rise 

our way now leads to the chamber of want and suicide 

we return to the nameless man whom we left sleeping on the way side 
stones in front of the widow smolby s house 

it was an hour previous to the scene which we will shortly depict 

two watchmen enveloped in thick white overcoats were taking their quie 
way along the deserted street their conversation was fraught with tha 
deep and absorbing interest peculiar to the conversations of sleepy watchmen 

i say smeldyke wots yer opin on o th tariff said the watchman in 
a fur cap don t yo think its the cause of half the robberies a-goin 

i don t know about that worlyput responded the other guardian of the 
night whose distinguishing characteristic was an extremely picturesque relic 
of a hat it seems to me there hai nt been nothin like comfort since the 
nasshunal bank was destroyed everything s gone wrong since then 
why you may believe it not but the wery day the news came in that the 
deposits was removed my wife makes me a present of a pair o boys now 
that never happened to us afore and bein a poor man with six growin chil 
dren it was nt a bit funny 

 what had the nasshunal bank to do with that responded the fur 
cap i tell you smeldyke it s the tariff wot makes all the mischief was 
not the tariff the cause o th florida war where them seminole injuns set 
fire to the bahamey banks 

 pooh don t talk to me i tell you its the removal o the nited states 
bank 

 don t pooh me responded smeldyke i was n t to be 

 poobe v by a man like you there now an wot have y t to say to 
that 

doubling his fists smeldyke advanced toward hiscomr uardian with 
a manner full of menace worlyput squared his elbov jd returned his 



god is just 

brother guardun s look of fierce defiance there was every prospect of a 
fierce encounter between those respectable functionaries when their attention 
was attracted by a deep groan proceeding from the centre of the street 

in silence they advanced to the side of the prostrate man as he lay with 
his limbs flung carelessly over the rough stones of the street his face was 
pressed against the earth and his long dark hair was soiled with the dust 
and mire of the gutter 

 come feller wake up you re a purty one to be iayin here in this 
state exclaimed smeldyke raising the strange man on his feet 

 yes you re a purty feller you are chimed in worlyput in these days 
o washin tonian rewivals when they makes congressmen out o drunkards 
and the worse drunkards they ve been the better congressmen they makes f 
you re a beauty i vow 

with these amiable words on his lips the intelligent smeldyke dealt the 
unconscious man a vigorous punch in the sides and worlyput paid a simi 
lar compliment to his breast and shoulders 

 what ave you got to say for yourself eh 

 mary i will save you save you yet exclaimed the stranger opening 
his eyes and gazing wildly around the last beams of the setting moon 
jell upon the discolored face of byrnewood arlington 

 mary there is death in my path but i will save you he shouted 
springing from the grasp of the watchmen i will save you yet and 
with a speed that defied pursuit he darted down the street dashing his arms 
wildly overhead and shouting madly as he was lost to view in the shadows 
of the street 

 mary the name was borne upon the winter wind 

 well if that ai nt cool ejaculated smeldyke 

 i suspect mary s his wife the young scamp been ill-treatin her has 
se i say smel my boy wots your idea of the nited states bank 

shouting the name of his sister to the still night his senses whirling in 
mad confusion and an awful consciousness of calamity pressing upon his 
heart like a dead man s hand upon the breast of the living the brother fled 
along the deserted street his flashing eyes upturned to the starlight sky 
while his long black hair streamed wildly on the winter wind 

he knew not why he fled but there was madness in his veins and fire in 
his heart invisible hands seemed leading him onward had some fathom 
less chasm yawned at his feet he would have plunged into its darkness with 
a frenzied joy the very stars of night had a voice for him a low-toned 
and whispering chaunt filled the vault of heaven and its burden was full of 
omen and woe 

thus madly with his hands grasping at phantoms he fled along the silent 
streets while time and space were lost and forgotten in his delirium 

it was after the space of half an hour when standing motionless as stone 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

at the corner of a wide street his hands solemnly upraised td the sky and 
a wild oath trembling on his lips it was at this moment when his dark eyes 
blazed with frenzy that the spell passed from him and he stood like a man 
aroused from a dream he looked around in vague wonder the effect of 
the potion was gone and with it had passed all memory of the fearful in 
cidents of the last forty -eight hours 

he stood there beneath the gleam of the starlit sky and his reason was 
with him but when he tried to remember an incident or even a thought of 
the moment previous all was shadow and dream 

this was indeed the peculiar curse of the potion administered by devil- 
bug it destroyed the memory there are men who can never call to 
mind the incidents of a sight of intoxication with these men wine is oblivion 
so with the drugged potion it might stupify a man it might arouse him 
into frenzy he might murder his best friend while under its influence but 
that influence once over he was as unconscious of the past as the dead are 
of the living 

 i have had a horrible dream muttered by me wood folding his arms 
and stalking slowly along the pavement ah see how it is i have 
been indulging in wine fool that -i am to steep my soul in madness 
yes yes i remember i was with lorrimer we drank freely i became 
erazy from the effects of the wine left my company and here i am wander 
ing about the streets like an escaped lunatic i vow i ve lost my hat he 
raised his hand to his head and my hair is matted and tangled pshaw 
what a miserable fool i have been making of myself 

he ground his teeth together with mortification and remorse 

 it was indeed a horrible dream mary dishonored yes yes and let me 
remember who did i dream was her seducer was it lorrimer it has all 
escaped my memory but it was a fearful dream thank god it was a dream 

he clasped his hands in silent joy 

 thank god it was a dream 

a wild sound like the cry of a strong man in mortal agony broke on the 
still night air byrnewood listened and looked around he stood in front 

of a row of massive buildings dwellings and warehouses with a small frame 
house arising near the centre of the square like an image of starvation in 
the midst of plenty 

again that low moaning sound startled the still air 

the door of the frame house was flung suddenly open and the figure of 
a woman rushed out upon the side-walk 

 help help she cried in the shrill tones of age there is murder 
in this house help help 

she perceived byrnewood and rushed forward and clung wildly to h arm 

 for god s sake stranger she cried as her white hair escaping from 
beneath her torn cap streamed down to her shoulders for god s sake 
tranger this way 



god is just 

nd ere he could reply she hurried into the house clinging nervously to 
nis arm while she urged him onward they passed through a dark room 
and in an instant stood at the foot of a narrow stairway at the head of which 
a light was streaming from an open door 

 quick quick or we ll be too late screamed the old woman as she led 
the way up-stairs her tongue and her feet clattering to one brisk tune you 
see i m a poor widow and about six months ago i let out the upper part 
of my house to poor davis he was a carpenter and no doubt meant to do 
well but troubles came thick upon him he could not get any work and about 
a month ago his wife died come in sir or we ll be too late oh my 
god sich a thing in my house and then sir some rascal i wish i had 
the villian here ruined his poor daughter and so to-night poor davis went 
out and oh my god my god 

they stood at the stair-way and the light from the room flashed full in 
their faces byrnewood glanced within the room and felt his blood grow cold 

in that chamber starvation and suicide watched by the death-bed of 
innocence 

ere byrnewood enters the place of death we must travel back some hours 
in our story 

our episode will furnish to the worjd a pleasmg illustration of that justice 
which in the quaker city unbars the jail to great swindlbfv while it sends 
the honest poor man into the grave of the suicide 

the state house clock had just struck eight when amid the gay crowds 
who thronged chestnut street might be discerned one poor wan-faced man 
who strode sadly up and down the pavement in front of a jeweller s window 
the night was bitter cold but a tattered round-about and patched trowsers 
constituted his scanty apparel he had not been shaven for several days 
and a thick beard gave a wild appearance to his lank jaws and compressed 
lips his face was pale as a mort-cloth but jjis eye shone with that clear wild 
light that once seen can never be forgotten there was famine in the un 
natural gleam of that eye his much-worn hat was thrown back from his 
pale forehead and there in the lines of that frowning brow you might read 
the full volume of wrong and want which the oppressors of this world write 
on the faces of the poor 

up andcfown thecold pavement he strode he looked from side to side 
for a glance of pity there was no humanity in the eyes that met his gaze 
fashionable dames going to the opera merchants in broad-cloth returning 
from the counting-house bank directors hurrying to their homes godly 
preachers wending to their churches their faces full of sobriety and their 
hearts burning with enmity to the pope of rome these all were theie on 
that crowded pavement but pity for the poor man who with famine writ 
ten on his forehead and blazing from his eyes strode up and down in front 
of the jeweller s gaudy window not one solitary throb 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 no bread no fire muttered the mechanic as he looked to the sky with 
r dark scowl on his brow no bread no fire for two whole days i can 
bear it but god my child my child 

with the tattered cuff of his coat sleeve he wiped away a salt tear from 
his cheek 

 god he fiercely muttered between his set teeth is there a god i 
is he just then why have these people fine clothes and wam homes when 
 with honest hands have no bread to eat no fire to warm me 

your pardon pious people your pardon for the blasphemy of this starving 
wretch starvation you know is a grim sceptic a very infidel a doubter 
and a scoffer 

 two days without bread or fire he muttered and strode wearily along 
the street suddenly a half-muttered cry of delight escaped from his lips 
a splendid carriage drawn by two blood horses with a coat of arms gleam 
ing on its panels met his gaze it was the work of an instant for the me 
chanic to spring up behind this carriage while a smiling-faced elderly gen 
tleman sate alone by himself within and away the horses dashed until 
they reached a large mansion in one of the most aristocratic squares of the 
city the smiling-faced elderly gentleman came out of the carriage and 
after telling james the coachman to be very careful of the horses he took 
his night-key from his pocket and entered the mansion 

 he failed three days ago said the mechanic glancing at the mansion 
with a grim smile as he leapt down from the coach the bank of which 
he is president broke a fortnight since ha ha 

and with a hollow laugh he pointed to the retreating coach and then to 
the mansion from whose curtained windows the blaze of lights flashed out 
upon the street 

 he is the president of the bank that broke and yet has his coach and 
horses his house his servants and his wines i had six hundred dollars in 
that bank and yet have not a crust of bread to eat i spose this must be 
what they call justice 

and with that same mocking laugh he strode up the marble steps of the 
bank presidents palace 

 i will make another effort he whispered and if that fails ha 

god will take care of my child as for myself ha ha i spose the 
over-seers of the poor will bury me 

the door of the bank president s palace was ajar the mechanic pushed 
it open arid entered a ruddy glow of light streamed through the parlor 
door-way into the hall walking boldly forward the mechanic paused at 
the door and looked in oh such fine furniture a splendid glass above the 
mantel ottomans a sofa a gorgeous carpet and silk curtains drooping along 
from the windows magnificent furniture 

 and he is the president of the broken bank 

mr job joneson the president of the bank which had just failed for only 



god is just 

onfc million dollars sate writing at a table in the centre of that gorgeous par 
lor he was a pleasant man with a round face and small eyes a short 
neck and a white cravat corpulent paunch and a showy broad-cloth coal 
altogether job joneson esq was one of your good citizens who subscribe 
large sums to tract societies and sport velvet-cushioned pews in church he 
did not perceive the entrance of the mechanic but having taken his scat in 
a hurry was making some memoranda in his note book by the light of 
the astral lamp 

 twenty dollars to the society for promoting bible christianity at rome 
thus he soliloquized good idea that be in all the patent-gospel papers 
two hundred dollars for jewellery mrs joneson is very extravagant fifty 
dollars for furniture broken by my son robert who is now at college bad 
boy that one thousand dollars for a piano grand piano for my daughter 

corinne ha hum who s there what do you want 

the mechanic advanced and taking off his hat approached the table it 
was a fine contrast the unshaven mechanic and the bank president on 
this side of the table rags and want on that side broadcloth and plenty 
here a face with famine written on its every line there a visage redolent 
of venison steaks and turtle soup 
your business sir 

 do you not know me mr joneson i am john davis 
 indeed you shingled a house for me last summer why you are 
sadly changed 

the lip of the mechanic trembled 

 i was a little better-looking last summer i believe he said but mr 
joneson i have called upon you in order to ascertain whether there is any 
hope of my ever getting any portion of my money from the 
bank 

 not one cent said the bank president taking out his watch and play 
ing with the seals 

 i worked very hard for that money mr joneson fve frozen in the 
winter s chill and broiled in the summer s heat for that money mr joneson 

 my dear fellow you talk to me as if i could help it said mr joneson 
gazing intently upon the motto engraven on his seal up with the bible 
 and now mr joneson i am without work my money is gone con 
tinued john davis speaking in a low tone that god s angels could not listen 
o without tears my child lays at the point of death 

how can i help that my good fellow i am sorry that your child is 
sick but can i help it said the bank president in the tone of withering 
politeness 

 i have neither bread nor medicine to give her said davis as his grey 
eye blazed with a strange light there has been no fire in her room for 
two days 

 get work said the bank president in a short decided tone 






 ravoni the sorcerer 

 where and davis extended his lean hands while a quiet look of 
despair stamped every line of his countenance 

 anywhere everywhere you don t mean to say that an able-bodied 
v man like you can t get work in this enlightened city of philadelphia pshaw 

 i have tried to get work for two long weeks and am now without a crust 
of bread and john gazed steadily in joneson s face 

 well then where s your credit you don t mean to say that an indus 
trious mechanic like you are or ought to be can t obtain credit in this enter- 
prizing city of philadelphia 

 there is no imprisonment for debt said john with a sickly smile 
 no poor man gets trust now-a-days 

 well my poor fellow i am sorry for you sorry that our bank failed to 
meet its liabilities sorry that you invested your little money in it very sorry 
but d ye see i have an engagement and must go 

the corpulent bank president rose from his seat inserted his watch in its 
fob put on his great coat and moved toward the door 

davis stood as if rooted to that gorgeous carpet he made an effort to 
speak but his tongue produced but a hollow sound then his lip trembled 
and his quivering fingers were pressed nervously against his breast 

 come my fellow i pity your case but i can t help it there is a meet- 
ing of the patent-gospel association to-night and i must go you see my 
fellow the pope of rome must be put down and i must go an help do it 

davis advanced toward the corpulent bank president 

 look here mr joneson he said in that husky whisper which speaks 
from the thin lips of want my hands are hardened to bone by work 
look at these fingers d ye see how cramped and crooked they are well 
mr joneson for six long years have i slaved for that six hundred dollars 
and why because i wanted to give my wife a home in our old age be 
cause i wished to give some schoolin to my child this money mr jone 
son i placed in your hands last summer you said you d invest it in stock 
and now now sir my wife has been dead a month my child lies on her 
dyin bed without bread to eat or a drop of medicine to still a single death- 
pain an i come to you and ask you for my money an you tell me that 
the bank is broke now mr joneson what i want to ask you is this 

his voice trembled and he raised his hands to his eyes for a single instant 

 will you lend me some money to buy some wood and some bread 

 why davis really you are too hard for me said the round-faced jone 
son moving a step nearer to the threshold there was a supercilious curl 
about his fat lip and a sleepy contempt about his leaden eyes 

 will you cried davis ns voice rising into a whispered shriek will 
you lend me one dollar 

 davis davis you re too hard for me said the bank president jingling 
the silver in his pocket with his gouty hands the fact is were i to listen 
o all such appeals to my feelings would be a beggar to-morrow 

he strode quickly over the threshold as he spoke 



god is just 

 john he cried to the servant who was passing through the hall if 
anybody calls for rne you can say that i have gone to the special meeting 
of the american patent-gospel association and look ye john tell james 
to have the coach ready by twelve to-night one of the directors gives a 
party and i must be there and when this person goes out you can put 
down the dead-latch 

having thus spoken the bank president walked quietly to the front door 
of the mansion and in a moment was passing along the crowded street 
john davis stood in the centre of that gorgeous parlor silent and motionless 
as a figure carved out of solid rock 

come mister as the gentleman s gone i spose you may as well tortle 
said a harsh voice john davis looked up and beheld a fat-faced servant 
in livery motioning him toward the front door 

without picking his hat from the carpet john walked slowly from the 
house 

meanwhile job joneson esq passing with a dignified waddle through the 
crowded street reached the corner of sixth and chesnut streets where the 
outline of the state house arose into the clear cold star-lit sky 

a hand was laid gently on his shoulder joneson turning quickly round 
beheld a man of some thirty years whose slovenly dress and red nose be 
trayed his profession he was a tip-staff of one of the courts of justice 

beg pardon sir your name joneson sir there is a case to be tried 
in court to-morrow and you are summoned to appear as a witness here s 
the subpoena 

joneson reached forth his hand to grasp the paper when the figure of john 
davis strode quietly between him and the tip-staff 

 and shrieked a voice wild and broken yet horrible in its slightest 
tones and have a summons for you also the bank president made 
an involuntary start as the glare of those maniac eyes flashed upon him i 
subpoena you you job joneson to appear at the bar of almighty god be 
fore day-break to-morrow 

and he raised one thin hand to heaven while the other rested upon the 
bank president s shoulder joneson shrunk from that touch it was like 
hot lead on the bare skin 

 will be there whispered davis there and he waved his 
thin hands towards the stars at the bar of god almighty before day 
break to morrow 

the bank president raised his hands to his eyes with an involuntary ges 
lure when he again looked around the maniac was gone 

we will leave job joneson esq until the hour of daybreak on the morn 
mg of friday the twenty-third of december 

byrnewood arlington stood on the threshold of the poor man s chamber 
the first object that met his eyes was the body of a man flung over tw 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

chairs with the arms dropping heavily to the floor and the long thin fingers 
touching the uncarpeted boards a miserable candle half burnt to its socket 
and fixed in an old bottle was placed upon a table rough pine the flicku- 
ing light fell over the face of the man it was pale and livid the lips hung 
epart and the lower jaw was sunken byrnewood advanced and looked 
and again that cold chill ran through his veins there was a gash across 
the throat of the man and his dingy shirt was spotted with curdled blood 

byrnewood started as if to avoid the sight when a low faint cry burst 
upon his ears it was the cry of a child 

 you see said the old woman pointing to a cradle in a dark corner of 
the room the child was born about three weeks since and i took care 
of it while the mother was sick little did iknow that the poor girl wanted 
for bread and she a mother too 

 the mother muttered byrnewood as his expressive face manifested a 
strange agitation where is she 

 there behind you answered the old woman 

byrnewood suddenly turned round and beheld a white sheet thrown over 
k miserable bed in one corner of the room beneath the folds of the sheet 
the outlines of a human form were perceptible it looked like a statue of a 
beautiful woman covered with a thin drapery that but half concealed it from 
the view the arms lay motionless along the bed and the feet were thrust 
upward causing a slight elevation in the folds of the sheet 

byrnewood advanced to the bedside his face was ashy and the sweat 
hung in thick beads upon his his forehead 

 an the night afore last cried the old woman as he advanced sick 
as she was poor thing she went out in the street to try and find him the 
villain who 

a deep groan heaving from byrnewood s chest made the old woman 
start with a strange fear 

byrnewood advanced slowly he knelt by the bed of death the sheet 
concealed the face of the dead girl byrnewood reached forth his hand 
the white fingers trembled like leaves in the wind 

he lifted the sheet and looked upon the face of the dead one look was 
enough with a wild howl he fell backward and for a moment lay like a 
dead man on the floor a low groan came from his lips then with a 
sudden bound he sprang to his feet his dark eyes were rivetted to the face 
of the dead again that wild cry burst from his heaving chest his hands 
were pressed madly against his forehead he fled from the room and from 
tne house as though hell was yawning at his back 

the old woman stood stricken dumb with astonishment it was some 
nunutes before she could recover her presence of mind 

oh my god my god she cried what s the use of so much 



god is just 

misery in the world what good does it do oh lor what am i sayin 
an she so young an beautiful oh lor oh lor 

 and how is our young patient said a soft and whispering voice 

the old dame turned round with a start the signior ravoni stood 
before her his slight form clad in a long robe or surtout of dark cloth 
adorned with fur along the edges and around the neck the sleeves hung 
wide and loose their dark fur borders imparting a marble whiteness to the 
delicate hands of the signior a diamond pin of dazzling lustre confined 
the plain black cravat which encircled his throat while his black hair long 
and lank was surmounted by a circular cap of dark fur his sallow face 
wore a calm and insinuating smile as his dark eyes were fixed upon the 
countenance of the old dame with a clear impenetrable glance that sent a 
shudder through every fibre of her withered frame 

 and how is our young patient 

 dead oh my god dead shrieked the old woman pointing towards 
the couch 

 dead cried the signior with a start and this sight he whispered 
as his glance rested upon the form of the suicide what does it mean 

 why you see doctor raven when i went to see you the tother day 
and begged you to come and wisit a poor girl ns was sick an had no 
friends for i d heered you was kind and charitable tho a forriner i did n t 
know how poor davis was and my god all the time you re been comin 
here unknown to davis d ye mind for he was poor but proud and 
could n t bear to think of havin a doctor tend on his child for mere charity 
and so what was i a-sayin oh why all this time davis has been 
waitin for bread and so to night 

 cut his throat in despair and this in the picua quaker city and 
a withering smile played around the expressive iips of the signior cut 
his throat because he had no bread to give his child can such things hap- 
pen in pious and protestant philadelphia 

oh my god cried the old woman bursting into tears if i live 
a-hundred years more i ll never forget the look which she gave me to-night 
when she was dyin and her words missus wilson says she with the 
tears in her big blue eyes that crust of rye bread on the table yonder is 
all that i ve had to eat for twelve long hours she was too proud to speak 
of it until she was dyin 

 there was a noble soul locked in that lifeless form muttered ravoni 
 and the medicine which i gave you last night 

 i mixed it with some gruel which i made for her and she drank it but 
it was n t of any use she died an hour afterwards 

she died an hour afterwards echoed ravoni with a meaning smile 

 she died in my arms only half an hour ago chimed in the old dame 
 an there but five minutes ago as i was straightenin her out on the bed 
ker father poor john davis comes in looks for an instant on the face of his 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

child and then oh lor oh lor he cuts his throat from ear to ear and 
falls on two cheers as dead as a stone 

 he is yet warm muttered ravoni laying his hand on the dead man s 
face there is an awful despair written in the face of that ghastly corse 
and so she died an hour after taking the medicine 

 and sich a purty corse cried mrs wilson jist look there did 
ever ye see sich hair so curly and long and so like gold did you ever 
see sich a mouth 

she lifted the sheet and ravoni gazed upon the countenance of the life 
less girl death was there in beauty long curling locks of golden hair 
fell twining around a mild and wining countenance with arching eyebrows 
lips that smiled even in death and a round chin still indented with a laugh 
ing dimple the neck was snow-white and as the sheet was lifted slowly 
up a gleam of light shone upon a fair young bosom dainty food for 
the grave-worms 

death was upon the face and the bosom in holy beauty the veins still 
traced their azure lines upon the alabaster of those rounded globes a rose 
bud spot of red still bloomed upon each swelling cheek 

ravoni folded his arms and gazed upon the corse in speechless silence 
his meaning eyes dilated and flashed with a peculiar expression and his thin 
lips trembled with an emotion as strange as the gleam of his eyes 

 widow you are poor but you have been kind to this man and his child 
he said in a calm dignified whisper here is money for the funeral of this 
poor suicide i myself will attend to the burial of the girl 

the widow was about to reply when a confused sound like the trampling 
of feet over the pavement below attracted their attention then came the 
sound of a door flung suddenly open and then a voice resounded from the 
foot of the stairway 

 hallo is there anybody in this house it cried in thick gruff tones 
 its the watchman muttered the widow going to the head of the stairs 
 is that you mister thompson 

 yes it is widow replied the gruff voice but here s a man taken sick 
in his carriage comin home from a party and he wants help mighty bad 

you see master made a little too free with the wine at deacon rogers 
house chimed in another voice an consequence is he s took bad 
with an appylectic fit 

then the sound of footsteps was heard on the stairs and in a few 
moments the hack of the watchmen s great coat appeared in the doorway 
with the fat face of a man in livery peering over his shoulder between 
them was the body of the sick man he groaned and struggled as they 
aid him on the floor and turned his head from side to side as though the 
death rattle was in his throat 

as his head turned from side to side the light fell upon the round fat face 
of job joneson the bank president 



god is just 

well screamed the man in livery if there aint the man i turned 
from master s door last night if there he aint with his throat cut 

the watchman looked upon the suicide with a start and muttered dis 
tinctly to himself the words dam fool watchmen are great 
philosophers 

meanwhile in the centre of the uncarpeted floor his dark broadcloth coat 
soiled by the white foam which fell from his lips his round face turned from 
glowing red to dark purple with the distorted veins standing out from his 
skin lay job joneson the bank president moving piteously as he clutched 
the breast of his shirt with his gouty fingers his eyes red and bloodshot 
protruded from his face and rolled from side to side with a pitiful stare 

 cant you do nothin for him nobody said the man in livery he s 
my master 

 i am afraid all is over said ravoni stooping down over the prostrate 
bank president however we may bleed him 

the words had scarcely passed his lips when joneson rose on his knees 
with a violent struggle 

 where where he muttered as a gurgling noise sounded in his 
throat where am i ah his voice rose into a horrible shriek 
husky with the death rattle he beheld the ghastly face of the suicide 

 ah a-h he groaned clutching at his throat with his gouty hands 
 at the bar of god almighty before daybreak to-morrow 

with these words on his lips he fell a shapeless mass of clay he had 
obeyed the subpoena of the suicide he had gone to meet his pale accuser 
before the throne of eternity 

god is just 

this is a truth we often hear preached but it falls upon our ears with a 
hollow sound 

god is just 

come hither all the world come to the chamber of want and suicide 
and gaze upon this picture of god s justice 

on the floor the bare and uncarpeted floor lay the portly form of the 
bank president beside the very chairs which supported the lean figure of 
the suicide the face of the bank president was loathsome purple and 
his bloodshot eyes hung from their sockets the visage of the suicide ashy 
pale and there was a red gash across his throat 

the legalized robber lay beside the wretch whom he had plundered the 
well-fed bank president who not ten hours past had refused the starving 
mechanic one solitary dollar now lay beside the victim of his lawful fraud 
like that victim a loathsome mass of clay on which worms would soon hold 
heir revel 

say was not this the justice of god 

and the trembling light fell over the forms of the two dead rnenthe sum- 
moner and the summoned and upon the figures of the strange group who 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

encircled them there was the signior ravoni his sallow face wearing 
that meaning smile his eyes flashing their calm impenetrable glance while 
with folded arms he gazed upon the dead the old widow and the phlegma 
tic watchman and the well-led servant all stood by gazing upon the sceno 
with one common awe 

and behind the group was the bed of death with the cold white sheet 
thrown over the icy form of the ruined girl 

the good and merciful god has flung between our eyes and the shadow 
of eternity an awful veil or else we might follow up to judgment the soul 
of the bank president we might behold the long train of orphan s ghosts 
who follow his soul with curses to the bar of almighty justice and there 
while the pale suicide stalks before him blasting his sight with a spectacle 
of speechless woe we might see how the guilty wretch trembles and crouches 
in the presence of his god as the wrongs of ten thousand men and women 
and children beggared by his fraud come blackening upward in palpable 
shapes of doom 

but let him pass to his account there are hundreds like him walking 
the streets of the quaker city their round fat faces wearing a pleasant smile 
as they think of houses and lands torn from the honest poor by legalized 
robbery let them all pass god is just 

the watchman and the man in livery bore the dead man to his carriage 

 how cussed heavy the old chap is muttered the watchman as he 
tumbled the mass of clay through the carriage door 

 wonder who in the d ill pay me my wages cried the man in 
livery jumping up behind the coach 

the coachman who had been sleeping on his box woke up from his quiet 
nap and asked a brief question 

 i say john is it a common fit or has the old man kicked the bucket 

 kicked the bucket james 

 no replied the other in a tone of complacent wonder cussed glad 
he paid me off yesterday w-h-oop 

he applied the whip to the blood horses and away they dashed bearing 
to his home his wife and children the dead body of the bank president 

as the carriage drove away from the door and disappeared in the distance 
another vehicle came slowly along the street and halted in front of the widow s 
house it was drawn by one horse and was by no means as gorgeous in 
appearance as the coach of the bank president there was no gaudy coat 
of arms emblazoned on its panels nor did the coachman wear a livery of 
showy hues garnished with bright tinsel tt was a hearse arid the driver 
who dismounted from the box was dressed in black with thick folds of crape 
drooping over his face 



god is just 

 it s near day-break he muttered in a hoarse voice it s near day 
break and i must be in a hurry werry fine coffin that 

he pointed to the glittering coffin which the uplifted folds of the hearse 
posed to view and then disappeared into the house of the widow 

ravoni and the old woman stood beside the bed of death 

 i will attend to the burial of the girl said ravoni placing gold in the 
hands of the woman 

as he spoke the figure of a man with crape drooping over his face glided 
between the twain and extending his rude hands gathered the sheet around 
the form of the dead girl 

 what does this mean cried the old woman with a haggered look 
don t xactly know what to make of it 

the man with the crape hung round iis face silently placed the body of 
the girl upon his shoulder and while ravoni confronted the old woman strode 
quietly toward the doorway 

 what does it mean why d ye take the body from this house said 
the old woman in the shrill peevish tones that old women are wont to use 
when slightly angered 

 woman do you think i could harm the dead said ravoni and he bent 
the glance of his unfathomable eyes upon the withered face of the woman 

there was something awful in the magic of that man s look 

the arms of the old woman fell by her side and she stood like a statue 
yet with her grey eyes chained to the glance of ravoni 

what was the power of this man in the dark ages they would have 
called it magic in the nineteenth century they call it magnetism 

 are you satisfied said the signior with a mild and insinuating smile 

 yes yes gasped the old woman only leave me that s all 

the man with the corpse on his shoulder thrust aside the crape from his 
face the grim visage of devil-bug was revealed by the beams of the 
trembling light 

 curse the man he muttered i b lieve he s a born devil i don t 
feel as tho i had a will of my own any more i don t like the way things 
work 

he strode down stairs with these muttered words on his lips as the 
corpse of the mother disappeared the babe sleeping in the cradle awoke and 
uttered a faint cry 

 here is gold for the child said ravoni and then folding his arms 
calmly together strode from the house 

the rattling of the hearse as it dashed along the deserted street broke on 
his ears 

 ha ha i must prepare for the scene of to-morrow he muttered now 
for my home now for the orgie of ravoni 

ho paused for a moment and raised his hands to the day-break sky 
 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 ye stars beneath whose light i have walked two hundred years tell me 
shall i not live until my name is worshipped as a god among these play 
things of an intellect like mine there men who plot and plan and gather 
gold and yet creep into the same dull grave at last 



 chapter second 

the curse op the drugged potion 

the day was breaking in the east when a pale man came trembling up 
the marble steps of a mansion in south third street and leaning against 
the stone pillars of the door buried his face in his hands while every fibre 
of his frame shook with emotion 

the day was breaking and red gleams of morning shot up into the sky 
cold white clouds sailing slowly through the heavens caught the first kiss 
of sun-rise on their bosoms 

the man who leaned for support against the heavy door pillars raised 
his face from his hands after a moment of silent agony and tossing his dark 
hair aside from his brow looked fixedly at the vacant air with set teeth and 
flashing eyes 

 it is all fancy i know it i know it and yet there there floating in 
the dim air i see her form oh how cold and icy the death-shroud 
waves round her stiffened limbs the taint of corruption is on her cheek 
her eyes so dead so lustreless have still a gleam that burns into my 
soul and i am her murderer yes yes her murderer her babe will 
live to curse my name in her last hour she called on me she shrieked 
my name with her last breath 

he pressed his hot eye-balls against his hands and was silent again a 
terrible remorse had seized upon the soul of byrnewood arlington 
ln that hour the poor drudge the despised servant girl was forgotten 

the wronged woman holy because trusting innocent because loving with 
 pure love that flung the world of her honor at her lover s feet the 
wronged woman glided like a phantom between the seducer and the light 
a noble soul throbbed within the bosom of byrnewood arlington in 
crushing the honor of an unprotected girl he had only followed out the law 
whichthe lady and gentleman of christian society recognize with tacit 
reverence seduce a rich maiden wrong the daughter of a good family 
oh this is horrible it is a crime only paralleled in enormity by the blaspemy 
of god s name but a poor girl a servant a domestic oh no these 
are fair game for the gentleman of fashionable society upon the wrongs of 
uch as these the fine lady looks with a light laugh and supercilious smile 
s now it was that the better soul of byrnewood awoke within and plead 



the curse of the drugged potk n 

for the woman he had wronged could his life at that moment have restored 
her to life and purity he would have flung it on her grave with joy 

he stood at his father s door again in the strange oblivion of soul which 
succeeded the drugged potion he fancied that only a night had passed since 
he left his father s threshold 

the key was in the lock he turned it and after the lapse of a moment 
stood in the dark entry and closed the door at his back 

he advanced along the hall while an awful presentiment flashed over his 
soul dim memories of the scenes in monk-hall rushed upon him 

 i will seek my sister s room he muttered if she is there then all 
is right and these presentiments are but folly 

he was passing by the parlor door when the sound of voices talking in 
low tones arrested his attention gently opening the door he started back 
in surprise as a blaze of light rushed out upon the darkness of the hall he 
entered the parlor with a softened footstep and looked around in vague won 
der the astral lamp stood lighted on the centre-table and the remains of 
a coal fire mouldered in the grate 

two figures were seated upon the sofa an old man and an elderly dame 
they sat with their hands clasped on their knees and their eyes fixed 
vacantly upon the carpet so deep was their reverie that they did not look 
up or manifest any knowledge of the intruder s presence 

byrnewood stood chained to the spot by a silent horror scarce might 
he recognize his father in the care worn old man who sat silent and 
withered before him scarce might he know his mother in the hollow-eyed 
old woman whose dark hair slightly silvered by age fell carelessly over 
her shoulders 

he advanced a step and beheld that his mother s dark eyes were red with 
weeping his father s lips trembled with an incessant movement 

they looked like people who have been watching long days and weary 
nights by the sick-bed of some loved one without once changing their ap 
parel or taking an hour s repose 

byrnewood advanced another step they beheld him and started to thrir 
feet with a half-muttered cry oh there was a volume of hope and fear 
and agony in that involuntary shriek 

for a moment there was silence the father and mother gazed in the 
face of their son with the same look full of horrible suspense byrnewood 
returned that look and the three stood like statues of some unspeakable 
agony 

 mary gasped the father and then all further words died on his 
tongue he stood with his hands extended and his lips trembling as with 
a spasm 

 mary echoed byrnewood father there is some dark mystery here 
is she sick or or and his lips grew white or it may be that she 
j s dead keep me no longer in suspense tell me the worst at once 



 ravon the sorcerer 

 know you not byrnewood that your sister has been missing since tht 
night before last slowly asked the old merchant 

 the night before last echoed byrnewood surely father that can 
not be last night when i left home she was in your arms 

 last night echoed mrs arlington in vague astonishment 

 why byrnewood you have been absent from home for the last thirty- 
six hours exclaimed the merchant sharing the wonder of his wife 

byrnewooi made no reply but tottering to the sofa he buried his face in 
his hands ard was silent for a single moment with all the force of his 
soul concentrated on one point he endeavored to remember the events of the 
last thirty-six hours 

 did i ever think of this cried the father clasping his hands wildly 
together did i ever think of this when i toiled day after day over the 
desk laboring like a slave at the galley to build up a fortune which my 
children might enjoy when i was dead and gone did i ever think that 
mary mary for whom i have toiled and toiled for years should be torn 
from me in this way my god this suspense is tenfold more horrible 
than death 

 don t you remember her light laugh as she sprang over that threshold 
two nights ago i ll be back i ll be back to-morrow 

the mother paused and burst into tears there are some things which 
can be written down in language but not a mother s love nor a mother s 
fear what was mrs arlington thirty-six hours ago a blooming matron 
with a healthy cheek and a dark eye speaking affection and tenderness 
what is she now an old woman with a withered cheek and a hollow 
eye-socket a brain fired by a thousand mingling emotions and a heart can 
kered by the gnawings of care a mother s love does not manifest its 
tenderness in words but in the gleam of the eye or the smile of the lip a 
mother s fear is written down in the wrinkled brow the faded cheek the 
eye darting unnatural light and the lip quivering with a tremulous motion 
that speaks the helplessness of the agony that is eating into the soul 

 father mother cried byrnewood starting from his seat there is 
a strange mystery pressing on my brain i am either the victim of an aw- 
ful delusion or else there is in store for me for you for us all a reality 
worse than death even while i speak to you there are passing before me 
shapes and forms and visions whose mystery i dare not oh dare not 
speak to you you know father that i love mary that i always loved her 
you know that i would give my life for her trust the mystery of this 
matter with me a few hours will bring her back to this threshold in 
safety and honor or confirm these horrible suspicions which are working 
through my brain 

 yet stay byrnewood cried mr arlington as his son moved toward 
the door where have you been during the last thirty-six hours where 

 a-sk me not ask me not shouted byrnewood with a start and look 



the curse of the drugged potion fi 

full of frenzy ask me not for the sake of mary ask me not in a few 
hours i will return to you then you shall know all 

with these words he rushed from the room the old merchant gazed in 
the face of his wife who returned the intensity of his look in silence not a 
word was spoken not a single cry of anguish broke from the lips of father 
or mother they suffered in silence they endured while every tone of 
their lost daughter was ringing in their ears while every look of her beam 
ing face treasured by memory came back to haunt them like a ghost sent 
from the bosom of the past they endured and suffered in silence 

and yet in all the bitterness of their anguish not one thought came across 
their souls of mary s dishonor she might have been the victim of some 
terrible accident she might have lost her way in the crowded city to whose 
maze of streets she was a stranger she might be dead and buried and with 
out the knowledge of father or mother but that the voice of wrong had 
lured her from her home that her virgin soul had been stained by dishonor 
the thought never crossed their souls god in his mercy may have with 
held this horrible thought fom the brimming cup of their agony it was 
terror enough for them tc know that their child was gone but that she was 
dishonored better than to tell them this would it have been to pour 
molten lead on their quivering eyeballs 

byrnewood rushed hurriedly up the stairway of the mansion and in a few 
moments entered his bedchamber the morning dawn broke through the 
curtains that hung along the windows how his heart rose to his throat as 
he crossed the threshold thirty-six hours ago he had left that chamber a 
free-hearted and joyous man now he came back with an awful mystery 
pressing on his soul 

advancing toward a dressing bureau which stood between two lofty win 
dows byrnewood opened a drawer near the top and took from thence a 
small casket 

this casket he opened and placing some object which it contained within 
the folds of his vest he knelt down on the floor and raised his hands 
to heaven 

his face was ghastly pale his eyes were not upraised but they glared 
steadily forward with a wild and watery stare as he knelt you might 
see the muscles of his clenched hand writhe like serpents and his white lips 
moved but uttered no sound 

the first red gleam of the morning sun fell on his pale forehead still 
his lips moved with that soundless motion and the muscles othis hand still 
writhed beneath the skin 

it was thus for a moment he then arose on his feet and assuming 
another hat and cloak in the place of those which he had lost at mcmk-hall 
he went slowly down th si airs and from the house 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

it was now sunrise on the morning of friday the twenty-third oi 
december 

on christmas eve at the hour of sunset one of ye will die by thi 
other s hand the winding sheet is woven and the coffin made 

the prophecy rushed over the soul of byrnewood as he left his father 
threshold where he had heard it by whom it had been spoken or wh 
was the other person included in its wild denunciation all was shadow an 
mystery to byrnewood arlington 

 to-morrow night is christmas eve he muttered as the winter sun 
beams broke over his brow and then passed from the shadow of h 
father s door 

into that door again he did not return until the hour before sunset 
saturday the twenty-fourth of december the hour of christmas eve 



chapter third 

 ravoni a god 

the gleam of a vivid light illumined the audience chamber of ravoni 

beside the table in the centre of that room with its walls and floor and 
its ceiling of one gloomy blackness stood a man of impressive look and 
manner whose entire appearance was in strange contrast with the place 

his figure slight yet beautifully proportioned was clad in a costume like 
 that worn by the chevaliers of france in the palmy days that went before 
the night of the revolution he wore a coat of lustrous dark satin with 
wide skirts and sleeves hanging in easy folds around the waist around the 
collar and along the front it was adorned with rich embroidery of gold lace 
and in place of buttons a line of diamonds flung back the reflection of the 
light with a gleam like stars shining in a clear lake his vest was of snowy 
whiteness his hose of dark hues displayed the shape of his elegantly 
moulded limbs and his red-heeled shoes glittered with diamond buckles 
his shirt bosom was of transparent whiteness and his small white hands 
were relieved by the thick folds of the ruffles that fell back from his wrist 

altogether he presented a fine specimen in his appearance and costume 
of one of tfiose gorgeous gentlemen whose presence gave life and wit to the 
circle of courtiers who in the olden time clustered around the gay kings 
of france 

his head and face were singularly beautiful his complexion was a rich 
olive with a flush of deep vermillion warming the centre of each cheek his 
eyebrows were dark and arching his nose a delicate aquiline with slight 

 the red-heeled shoe was worn by the french nobility previous to the revolution 



ravoni a god 

nostrls that quivered in scorn and dilated in anger his mouth was smal 
and expressive with lips of the most voluptuous ruby the upper lip curled 
with a proud scorn while the lower projected slightly with an expression 
of refined voluptuousness his chin was small round and decided and 
altogether though somewhat large in proportion to the size of his body his 
face was at once thoughtful in its every outline and delicate in every feature 
his brow wide massive and deathly pale was well relieved by thick masses 
of dark hair which fell twining in ringlets to his shoulders 

and from beneath the shadow of that pale brow gleamed evermore the 
clear light of two dark eyes whose gaze sent a strange thrill of awe into the 
souls of men it was not the excessive brightness of these eyes that attracte 
your attention nor their intense blackness nor the delicate fringe of the long 
and quivering eye-lashes there was a strange magnetic power in their 
glance their look was a spell their anger an awful fascination that left the 
gazer powerless their love an irresistible influence that dragged the victim 
to shame and ruin with a smile that terrible consciousness of soul which 
men in their poverty of words call the will gleamed calmly and fixedly 
from those wizard eyes 

and this gayly dressed chevalier standing alone in the audience cham 
ber this strange man with the striking face and the shadowy eyes who was 
he 

it was the signior ravoni 

 yes yes i am myself once more he muttered striding slowly along 
the room the sallow hues of care have vanished from my cheeks the stoop 
of age has fallen from my shoulders once more i stand attired for the festival 
of ravoni that festival i have celebrated beside the waters of the gan 
ges in the fragrant air of ceylon amid the snows of the polar desert and 
in the boundless deserts where moulder the palaces of montezuma 

 two hundred years a glorious career once an idle courtier of a 

thoughtless king a chevalier whose very breath hung suspended on a mon 
arch s will now i am a soul an intellect a deathless power what play 
things are these men of science in all ages and in every clime the same 
when they have won a little knowledge they stoop from their proud height 
to gather gold in the gutter of a human and contemptible rivalry gathered 
knowledge i won science from the earth the air the sea from the very sky 
above me but how glorious the object for which that knowledge was acquired 

 what have i won a deathless career among things whose life is death 

 even now my soul leaps from scene to scene of that memory which 
written in books men would call history

 ravoni the sorcerer 

 when the torch of st bartholomew flashed through the streets of paris- 
i was there when the pikes of the revolution glittered around the scaffold 
of a doomed king and a pale-faced priest bade the son of st louis ascend 
to heaven i was there 

 the proud corsican stood on the heighth of the egyptian pyramid and 
surveyed his hosts scattered far and wide beneath at once his warriors and 
his worshippers while his bronzed brow lit up with a deathless ambition and 
his lip curled in scorn as he gave to the air the thought of his soul when 
all the world is mine then i will build up a religion of whose altars i shall 
be the god as these words fell from his lips i i the savan ravoni stood 
by his side 

 where is the corsican now where is ravoni 

 and in that old hall where fifty-six stern hearted citizens gave the law 
to a world down-trodden by tyrants there there i stood while the pens 
whose very ink was destiny were tracing the immortal signatures upon the 
scroll which is now eternal 

 i stood there and saw their faces fire as the last name was written 

 where are the signers now in the dust 

 where is ravoni still on his deathless career 

 i stood by the side of washington when he took the oath as president 
of this new world which was then the hope of all mankind 

 where is washington now and where is la fayette and adams and 
efferson and hamilton 

 ask the dust of annihilation to give back its dead 

 and what is that new world which they fondly hoped would become 
the ararat on which the ark of a world s salvation was to find a rest at last 

 go to her senate halls and find bullies and braggarts wearing the robes 
wice worn by men who were gods in soul 

 a pitiful craven lurks in the chair where washington once sate the 
vonder of a workl treason blasphemes the place once sanctified by honor 

 bribery sits on the judicial bench and a licentious mob administers jus- 
ice with the knife and the torch in the pulpit crouches grim superstition 
preaching a god whose mercy is one incarnate threat whose benificence 
is written on the grave stone of a wrecked world 

 such is the land of freedom for which washington fought and la fay 
ette bled 

and where is ravoni now still on his deathless career 

 such as ravoni have lived in all ages in every clime bold intellects 
who wrested from corruption the secret of undying energy and these 
intellects so various in their powers so various in their weird histories 
common tradition has combined in one form and called a thousand mighty 
souls by one paltry name the wandering jew superstition must bap f ize 
a giant truth in the waters of puerile fiction few of these great intellect 

 the reader will remember that the era of this story is the v ear 



ravoni a god 

survive at the present day some have grown tired of the sameness of their 
being and rushed into annihilation through the grim portals of suicide but 
few survive among these lives ravoni 

 and if this great earth must one day sink into chaos when the gleam 
of her last sun illumines the summit of the last solitary mountain reeling 
to its foundations it will also the brow of ravoni 

 i will build me up a religion 

 there is no god there is no heaven there is no hell at least 
the belief of the million with regard to mysteries like these is all shadow 
and fable 

 i believe in a god but my god is the power of a giant will in a 
heaven but it is that heaven which springs from the refused cultivation of 
all the senses in a hell i believe it is the hell of annihilation 

 the million led on by the herd of priests and drones have seized upon 
these truths of the olden sages and made realities of these fables by 
which thought spoke to the souls of men in the ancient times 

 i will build me up a religion a thousand years hence looking from 
the brow of some tremendous mountain i shall behold the plains below 
whitened by the marble domes of a mild and benificent religion those domes 
shall tower in the name of a god in the name of ravoni 

 the rock on which all religions have been wrecked shall not endanger 
the faith of ravoni its founder will not die he will not like mahom- 
med build up a beautiful system and then sink into the grave leaving his 
temple to the ravages of priestly liars and robbers 

 the faith of ravoni will be simple and beautiful war shall be buried 
anarchy forever dethroned all treason against the life of man shall be 
eternally crushed men shall live love and die in their peaceful beds 
priestcraft shall be no more 

 i will teach men that in the refined cultivation of the senses is happi 
ness not a pore on the body but may be made the minister of some new 
joy not a throb in the veins but may become a living pleasure every 
outrage committed against the refinement of the senses brings its own pun 
ishment when mirth sinks into drunken revelry man is a brute when 
love sinks into coarse lust man is a brute and devil 

 in order to acquire an influence over the minds of men which shall be 
irresistable and eternal i will appeal to a principle roofed deep in every 
human heart i will evoke the love of mystery i will awe and terrify by 
miracles and pageants and shadows 

 at noonday to-morrow they will behold the first miracle 

 now for the festival of ravoni 

the eloquent blasphemer passed through a small door concealed beneath 
the hangings as he spoke 

 now for the festival of pavoni where the senses hold their revel and 
thought is softened and mellowed in the delirious atmosphere of passion 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

chapter fourth 

the priestess op ravoni 

in the course if one hour occurred three prominent incidents of out 
revelation 

the state house clock struck nine and the carriage of the merchant 
prince stood waiting in front of his door the coachman in grey livery 
turned up with black velvet sat on the box and the footman attired in like 
costume stood beside the carriage door which was flung wide open the 
ournished harness of the dark bay horses glittered in the sunbeams and the 
panels of the coach emblazoned with the merchant s coat of arms shone likr 
mirrors in the light 

it was nine o clock and from the front door of the mansion the merchan 
and his wife came forth attired in a splendid travelling habit of dark greer 
cloth which developed each queenly outline of her form dora hung lightl 
on her husband s arm while her eyes shone with unusual lustre and hei 
cheeks glowed with the hues of the damask rose a she stepped gently 
down the marble steps she was peerlessly beautiful evltry look each ges 
ture and grace of her faultless limbs and imposing countenance bespoke the 
queen whose throne was in the hearts of all beholders 

it was observable that as the merchant led his wife toward the carriage 
his face half-buried in the shadow of a fur travelling cap was fumed away 
from hers and once or twice as her gloved hand touched his arm he shrunk 
with a slight but involuntary start as if there had been pollution in the 
contact 

their eyes met as they stood before the carriage door the merchant s 
face was almost hidden from the sight by his fur cap and the upraised 
collar of his great coat but his blue eyes dilated to an unnatural size gazed 
in the beaming face of his wife with a cold impenetrable look that sent a 
strange awe to her inmost heart 

the day is beautiful albert said dora with one of her winning smiles 

 it is indeed beautiful replied livingston as his lips parted not with a 
smile but with a spasmodic contraction of the muscles of his face we 
have seen many such beautiful days dora may we live to see many more 

there was a singular geam in his large blue eyes as he spoke have 
you invited our friends to meet us at hawkwood asked dora as she en 
tered the carriage 

 trust me dora we shall have a pleasant company at the good old 
place said livingstone in a tone of affected lightness bye the bye my 
dear you will have to travel on alone for an hour or so i have some 
business to transact which will detain me a short time in town i will join 
you on horseback in an hour 



the priestess of ravonl 

without waiting for her reply he softly closed the door and waved his 
hand to the coachman the carriage whirled away over the echoing stones 
of the street and livingstone stood alone in front of his mansion 

 let me see let me see he muttered pressing his hand against his 
forehead what author is it that tells the story of an english lord who 
world-worn and heart-sick used to amuse his leisure hours by rehearsing 
his own funeral ha ha there is scarcely twenty-four hours of life 
left to me and yet i while them away in digging my grave and another 
grave beside my own 

that cold spasm which mocked a smile played round the merchant s 
lips and he went slowly up fourth street in the direction of his warehouse 

the state-house clock struck nine and two little men were walking up 
and down the broad walk of independence square all around them arose vi 
the giant trees whose massive trunks had been young sixty years ago when 
the proclamation of independence rang from the steps of the ancient hall 
their leafless limbs shot upward into the cold blue sky and between their 
intricate branches the white clouds might be seen sailing slowly through 
the winter heavens at one end of the walk was walnut street with a line 
of splendid buildings towering in the place of the old gaol at the other 
through the vista formed by opposing lines of trees was seen the ancient 
state-house with its steeple rising into the full glow of the sunshine 

and up and down this walk paced two little men engaged in an interest 
ing conversation as might be seen from their linked arms and rapid gestures 
one little man wore a high hat and frock coat which was buttoned so 
tightly around his thick body that it gave you the idea of a mammoth dutch 
pudding stuffed and crammed until the skin was ready to burst beneath 
the skirts of this frock coat appeared a pair of legs which once seen might 
never be forgotten with a thick piece of cord reaching from one calf to 
another they would have described the letter a they rubbed together at the 
knees and were seperated by the space of a foot between the boots bury 
a man eighty years in a coal mine and show him those legs after he is 
brought out into the light again and show them to him apart from the pud 
ding body and if he had ever seen them before he would know them on first 
sight who could ever forget buzby poodle s legs 

the other little man was dressed in a grey over-coat and a shiny leather 
cap that pale square dresden-wax-doll-face would have been known 
among a thousand who could mistake the large oyster-colored eyes of 
sylvester j petriken 

and there they walked the editor of the daily black mail and the maga- 
zine proprietor poodle s face reminded you of a grimacing ape making 
mouths at a magpie petriken s was the visage of a solemn old baboon 
wrapt in deep thought the one fattened on the garbage of the town the 
other lived on stolen literature one was a scandal-monger a bravo on a 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

small scale the other a plagiarist a very jew who lived by clipping th 
coin of the wide realm of intellect there they walked the one living on 
the murder suicide and bloodshed of the town the other thriving on the 
fruits of various adroit literary robberies there they walked arm in arm 
alike the boon companions of blackguards and the loathing of all honest 
rv men these courtezans of the press poodle was the pander of the whole 
town anybody could buy him body and soul for three dollars a bottle of 
wine a bologna sausage and a few crackers petriken was the hireling of 
but one libertine gustavus lorrimer and his price varied from a two dol 
lar subscription to his magazine up to the value of a second-hand steel en 
graving 

 and so you see we ll have a great magazine exclaimed petriken with 
one of his sickly smiles to-morrow morning all the intellects of the land 
meet at my office in order to talk the matter over i sylvester j petriken 
will become the focus of american literature 

 won t the name of busby poodle be known all over the country pos 
terity shall reverence the name of poodle and millions yet unborn will write 
on their hearts is nt there somethin in that the name of poodle in 
scribed on the pillar of immortality a-longside the name of shakspeare 
and then the name of petriken 

 let us mingle our names together cried little sylvester striking an 
attitude we will go down to posterity as petriken and poodle 

 the petriken and the poodle huzza a sort of siamese-twinship of 
genius ensemble de chose decidedly the cheese as we say in domes 
tic french 

the little men then shook hands and stood erect like proud representa 
tives ofthe out-cast literature of the quaker city- 

suddenly petriken started 

 i vow there s lorrimer and mutchins i he exclaimed looking toward 
the state house and ere a moment had flown the magnificent gus stood by 
his side with the round-faced mutchins hanging on his arm 

 ha ha pet my boy how d ye do cried lorrimer as a gleam of laugh 
ter broke over his manly visage silly who is this fellow he continued 
arranging his moustache as he glanced at the black mail man with some 
what of a supercilious smile who is the gentleman in the big hat and 
duck legs 

 he he he you re quite jocular this morning exclaimed the little editor 
who had heard this a side speech why i m poodle sir buzby poodle 
of the the daily black mail and the little fellow advanced with a spring 

 oh you are buzby poodle exclaimed lorrimer with a glance from his 
half-shut eyes come on petriken come on mutchins i ve something to 
say to you and so that is poodle of the black mail is it jove he 
looks for all the world like a monkey dressed up to dance on the top of a 
trwet organ 



the priestess of ravoni 

and taking the arm of each gentleman within his own he strode down the 
broad walk leaving poodle to his own delightful meditations 

 well muttered buzby w-e- if i don t cut that fellow up some day 

my name ain t poodle and as for that petriken gt damme i ll go right 

to the office and abuse his western hem people that insult buzby poodle 
must look for a poodle s vengeance i m a perfect injin i am 

 boys i ve a capital joke for you exclaimed lorrimer as they hurried 
along the broad walk you see mutchins ha ha it s capital capital 

and d ye hear pet by jove man he cried starting suddenly you 

are as white as a cloth in the face 

petriken stood transfixed to the spot by some unknown horror 

not a word escaped his lips but standing motionless as one of the trees 
along the walk he pointed with his outstretched hand towards walnut street 

look look cried mutchins pointing in the same direction there s 
a sight for you lorrimer 

lorrimer looked toward walnut street and at the same moment a cold 
shudder darted through his frame he was dumb with astonishment could 
he believe his eyes yes yes there there before him advancing slowly 
and leisurely along the walk was the form of byrnewood arlington byrne- 
wood arlington whom he left the night before in the hands of devil-bug 
whom he never dreamt to behold among living men again lorrimer s 
expressive face grew pale and red by turns for a moment he gasped for 
breath 

 leave the matter to me he muttered to his companions who stood 
silent and mark ye deny everything d ye hear 

he had scarcely time to whisper these words to his frightened panders 
when byrnewood approached lorrimer started as he beheld the wild light 
gleaming from his dark eyes 

 i have a few words to say to you sir byrnewood begun in a low 
deep tone like a voice from a sepulchre 

 i beg your pardon sir cried lorrimer with a haughty inclination o-f 
his head you have the advantage of me i do not know you sir and 
his face was wreathed in a polite and insinuating smile 

 not know me echoed byrnewood was i not in your company last 
night 

 decidedly not and lorrimer dropped the arms of his minions and 
placed the head of his gold-mounted cane to his lips in an easy devil-may- 
care manner characteristic of a chesnut street lounger 

 why sir mr petriken here introduced me to you and the introduction 
look place at this gentleman s rooms he pointed to the red-faced mutchins 
as he spoke 

 pet did you ever introduce this gentleman to me exclaimed lorrimer 
with a meaning look 

 nev-er faltered the white- faced pander 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

and damme sir never saw you in all my life sir blustered mutcnms 
buttoning the front of his white coat in a pompous manner 

byrnewood placed his hand to his forehead for a single instant 

 i remember the introduction he said in a slow deliberate tone i re 
member being in the streets with you and beyond that all is darkness 

 depend upon it sir exclaimed lorrimer laying his hand pleasantly on 
byrnewood s shoulder you are the victim of some strange delusion i 
give you my solemn word of honor that i never saw you in my life before 

 and your name is lorrimer 

 egad you ve hit it bye-the-bye my dear fellow is n t that a bald 
er gle sailing among the clouds yonder 

with an air of languid nonchalance he pointed upward with his cane 

 will you give me your word of honor that you never saw my sister 
exclaimed byrnewood as the images of memory darted over his brain 

 your sister echoed lorrimer with a vacant stare oh ho my 
aear fellow you re too hard for me upon my honor i never saw your sister 
nor any member of your family to know them by name your name is 

 arlington responded the brother with a steady look byrnewood 
arlington 

 have heard the name but never knew any member of the family 
by jove that must be a bald eagle yonder 

byrnewood advanced a step nearer and looked silently into the darv 
hazel eyes of lorrimer 

 now for the last trial i he muttered and then repeated in a slow and 
solemn voice the words of the prophecy 

 on christmas eve at the hour of sunset one of you will die by the 
other s hand the winding sheet is woven and the coffin made tell 
me sir he added in a voice full of emotion did you never hear these 
words before 

lorrimer s cheek did not blench nor his eye quail he raised his cane 
languidly to his lips and then replied in a careless tone 

 never yet stay i think i ve read them somewhere in dickens 
or bulwer 

 oh madness madness muttered byrnewood pressing his hand forci 
bly against his forehead i am indeed the victim of some dark delusion 
excuse me gentlemen for this intrusion he continued in a tremulous 
voice it is all a dream a horrible dream 

with these words he darted down the walk his head bent on his bosom 
and his eyes fixed upon the ground 

 well lorrimer that was neatly done cried silly petriken approacn- 
ing the master-libertine who stood in the centre of the walk gazing upon 
the retreating form of byrnewood 

 you did him brown laughed mutchins but boys we must be careful 
jhere s a devil of a stir made about this babv-face 



the priestess of ravoni 

lorrimer made no reply a strange glow brightened over his face and 
his hazel eyes gazed sternly on the vacant air 

 i say lorrimer began petriken but a fierce scowl on the brow of the 
libertine silenced him 

without a word lorrimer strode slowly away from his companions and 
passing through the state house hurried rapidly along chesnut street 

his manly form his handsome face attracted many a look many a gaze 
of admiration but that heaving of the chest that flashing of the hazel eye 
little did the fair dames who gazed upon the handsome libertine dream of 
the hell that raged within his bosom 

christmas eve the river and the death glided like a warning from 
eternity before his dilating eyes dim and shadow-like yet terrible the 
vision rushed upon his soul 

it was nine o clock when a hackney coach driven by a negro whose 
hideous face afforded a strange contrast to his rich livery of dark green 
stopped before the door of widow smolby s house 

a man of slight form somewhat bent with years leaped from the couch 
and knocked at the door of the dreary mansion his long dark robe faced 
with furs attracted the attention of some inquisitive neighbors who from 
their doors or windows took observation of his appearance and his sallow 
face illumined by eyes of impenetrable darkness and relieved by masses of 
long black hair hanging loosely about his shoulders excited the wonder of 
some casual bystanders fie was evidently a strange man as the old lady 
gossips have it and his appearance in the streets of matter-of-fact philadel 
phia robed in this picturesque costume was a subject of more than common 
wonder among the intelligent shopkeepers of the place 

the door of the widow smolby s house was presently opened and a 
thick voice demanded the object of the visitor 

 wot s the row said the voice as a rubicand face appeared in the door 
way is the president dead or has he only sent for easy larkspur to go 
on a foreign mission what is it 

it was evident that easy larkspur had been wounded in a combat with a 
flagon of whiskey punch his breath was fragrant and his eyes were wink 
ing to quick music 

 i would see the young lady who sought refuge in this house last night 
exclaimed ravoni in his commanding tone 

you would would you which young lady for instance bess and 
the blue-eye girl went away an hour arter the old oman s funeral and the 
black-eyed female sits all alone up stairs a-moanin like the north-wind thro 
a key-hole you see stranger i m left here until the crowner comes 
back 

the lady up stairs is the one i wish to see replied ravoni tell 
her that i bear a message from her father 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 jist walk up an tell her yourself muttered larkspur come m 
alranger you ought to seen the old omans funeral it took place at sun 
rise and devil a preacher was at the grave to do a prayer giminy mer- 
self and the crowner s depitty was chief mourners did n t we do 
the groans 

closing the door larkspur led ravoni through the front room on the 
first floor 

 now sir up two pair o stairs in the front room you ll find the gal 
and look ye there s three or four maniac cats and a parrit a-prowlln 
about unchained if you see em kick em for my sake wot i ve suf 
fered with them cats durin the night imagination may conceive but pen can t 
denict the devils while i was drinkin my punch last night mi-a-w 
spit phiz they puts into my hair and me not sayin a word 

ravoni left the gentleman in the midst of his philosophic meditations and 
ascending the stairs in a few moments stood before the door of the front 
room on the third floor 

 now for this mad girl he muttered as he gently opened the door 
 this mad girl who fancies ha ha that she is not the child of her father 

he prepared himself for the sight of a gibbering idiot and entered the 
ghost chamber 

one step forward and he receded folding his arms as he gazed in silent 
wonder upon the unexpected vision that met his sight in the dim light 
that came through the purple curtains of a window flung open to the sun 
light for the first time in seventeen years sat a fair young girl dressed in 
white her hands clasped listlessly together while the transparent paleness 
of her face was beautifully relieved by her dark hair which hung in a thick 
mass along the cheek turned from the light and then fell drooping over her 
shoulder her eyes were downcast and the trembling eyelashes rested 
upon the alabaster of each cheek 

 and this is the mad girl muttered ravoni advancing by my life 
she looks not like a living thing but like a carved statue of some pure and 
holy enthusiasm 

mabel raised her eyes and gazed upon the portrait above the mantel a 
soft moisture glistened in each dark eye and a burning glow crimsoned the 
centre of each pale cheek 

 my mother she muttered and then with a start beheld the deep eyes 
of the sorcerer fixed upon her 

 start not my child he cried in his low and musical voice i come 
to lead you to your father 

 to my father sooner than return to his doors again would i beg my 
bread on the highway sooner far sooner would i 

 nay nay interrupted ravoni i speak not of the imposter who has 
so darkl wronged you but of your father how his musical voice liii 
gored on that word 



the priestess of ravoni 

true to the instructions which he had received from pyne on the nigh 
previous he now placed the note which the parson had written in the hands 
of the wondering girl 

 ha she exclaimed as she raised the note to the light it is a mes 
sage from my father mabel my own child so long lost to me but now 
forever rrgt ne trust yourself without fear in the hands of the bearer of this 
note he will lead you to your father to livingstone oh joy joy i 
am ready sir she cried with a radiant countenance as she extended her 
hands toward the sorcerer 

 what without hat or cloak said he playfully you love your fa 
ther then 

 oh sir my heart beats freer at the word lead me lead me to him 
to my father 

seizing an ancient and threadbare cloak which had once rested on the 
form of her mother from a chest near the bed she flung it over her shoul 
ders and stood ready to depart 

a calm yet meaning smile broke over the face of ravoni as he led her 
down the stairs and lingered around his expressive lips as he handed her 
into the carriage 

 and this child with the beaming face and the speaking eye is the mad 
girl he muttered as he sprang in the carriage and closed the door ho 
ho my parson you have entrusted your treasure to the lion s mouth 

a muttered word in a foreign tongue was the signal to the negro in green 
livery and the coach rattled away over the rough paving stones 

larkspur looked from the front door in mute and drunken wonder 
 does nt that beat pigeon-shooting to come an take the gal from under 
my wery eyes without so much as sayin thankee does nt it beat possum 
huntin i hope to grasshus some old nigger will take me as a prentice to 
the wood splittin business arter that howsomdever he muttered as he 
closed the door i must go and rig up as major rappahannock mulhill says 
and to-night ho ho won t we nab the murderer of the old woman bes 
sie did nt tell me nothin oh no 

meanwhile the carriage rolled on while ravoni sate gazing steadily in the 
beautiful face of mabel she felt a strange awe steal over her as the gleam 
of those dark eyes seemed to look into her soul 

 and she shall be the priestess of ravoni muttered the sorcerer 
and i shall see my father cried the fair girl in a joyous tone at 
last i shall find a home 

 here you shall see your father here you shall find a home 
as ravoni spoke the carriage stopped before the gloomy house whose 
bricks were painted a dull and tasteless yellow 

with a throbbing heart mabel leaped from the carriage with every vein 
fired by emotion she ascended the marble steps and as the door slowly 
 



s ravoni the sorcerer 

opened a wild cry of joy burst from her lips and she entered the den 

of the sorcerer 

ravoni cast one look at the bright sun ere he disappeared within the door 
and his large eyes dilating and burning wkh a lustre that was super-human 
seemed to behold some gorgeous landscape denied to all other sight 

 and she shall be the priestess of ravoni 



chapter fifth 

the dissecting room 

a tall thin man attired in a close fitting great coat was hurrying along 
walnut street his face marked by thick eye-brows and an aquiline nose 
and imbued with an expression of deep thought was drooped upon his chest 
and while his hands were buried in his coat pockets he muttered to himself 
as he hurried along 

 beautiful operation that would be beautiful to take a man s skull off 
look at his brains and then fasten it on again beautiful they say it s 
done in paris ha hum byrnewood that you heard anything of your 
sister yet sad thing that your father told me all about it sad thing 

 it is indeed doctor exclaimed byrnewood as he took mctorniquet by 
the hand had i but a single clue to the mystery i would follow it to the 
death but this utter darkness is worse than death itself 

never mind my boy never mind clear up after awhile clear up i 
say cried the good hearted doctor drawing byrnewood s arm within his 
own bye the bye byrnewood did ye ever read those accounts of burk 
ing folks in london five men hung at once for murdering live people 
in order to sell their bodies to the doctors its my opinion that that same 
thing is done in this good quaker city 

a terrible suspicion flashed over byrnewood s soul 

 my god he exclaimed this singular disappearance of my sister 
no traces of her after she left my father s house on wednesday night not 
a word or sign of her since the moment she crossed the threshold of her 
home doctor it is a horrible thought he dared not syllable forth 
that thought in words the dead body of his sister laid on the foul altar 
of a dissecting table 

 nonsense nonsense exclaimed the doctor reading byrnewood s sus 
picion in his look come with me my boy i want to preach you a sr- 
vnon on popular credulity you have heard something of a man they 
the signior ravoni 

 i have 



the dissecting room 

 he arrived in this city almost a year ago coming from god knows 
whence and going the devil cares where well this italian or frenchman 
or turk or jew no sooner puts his foot on the soil of the quaker city than 
he astonishes the faculty strikes science dumb plucks theology by the 
beard and in fact walks over everybody s notions on everything 

 how does he do all this 

 that s the mystery he walked into our medical halls unbidden and 
proved himself a great anatomist a splendid surgeon no one has had tne 
bravery or impudence to question him concerning his former life because 
there s a cold impenetrable gleam in his eye that few men would like to 
brave 

you spoke of his knowledge of theology 

there it is again i know several of our first divines this ravoni 
walked into their houses unknown and unbidden and astonished them 
first by his knowledge of the theory and philosophy of the reformation 
second by his daring and atrocious sophistries 

and the lawyers 

he knocks away their most elaborate arguments constructed with al 
the care that a child devotes to making a baby-house out of its toys with 
one clear word of practical reason that is worth a world of legal torn-foolery 
the lawyers and the judges hate him worse than poison 

 you spoke of popular credulity doctor 

 an unknown pretender appears in the quaker city and lo everybody 
hastens to entrust him with their own lives and the lives of those they love 
you ask how he gives out that he will cure the insane and before a day 
is past he has an hundred patients under his care 

 does he cure them 

 ha ha the ugly ones he cures and returns to their relatives with all 
possible despatch but the women and the handsome women ho ho it 
will require time is his invariable answer and then he has established a 
lecture room where he gives lectures on anatomy egad our students 
are crazy with the fellow 

 you said just now that he was a skilful anatomist 

 i never saw one half as good but i ll tell you what annoys me this 
ravoni has given out that he will reveal some important discoveries in 
anatomy at the hour of ten precisely this morning at his lecture room 
he pretends that he has discovered some new theory of the origin of life 
which he will illustrate by the dissection of a subject this annoys me 

why 

 because i believe its all humbug and the fact that our professors seem 
to place some confidence in the fellow furnishes me with a very good illus 
iration of the popular disposition to believe in moonshine 

 you will attend the lecture 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 of course should you like to witness a dissection of the human sub 
ject it s quite a treat to the jninitiated come along with me 

the fearful suspicion which had crossed byrnewood s min j not many 
minutes past now returned in all its vigor the dead body of his sister on 
the dissecting table 

 i will go with you he said and they turned into a southern street 
and after the lapse of a few minutes stood before the house of ravoui 

 we enter the dissecting hall by this alley said dr m torniquet 
leading the way along the narrow avenue on the east of the mansion did 
you ever see my blood horse harry clay 

ere byrnewood could answer this characteristic question the doctor 
pushed open a small door which was the only object that varied the massive 
side of the mansion from the pavement to the roof he then led the way 
up three flights of stairs so narrow and confined that there was barely room 
for one man to pass at a time between the walls the last of these stairs 
terminated in an extensive corridor which traversed the entire width of the 
building with the doors of various rooms fashioned in its walls and a wide 
window at either end giving light to the passage 

they traversed the corridor from east to west and then stood before a dooi 
of dark mahogany 

 first we enter the dissecting hall said the doctor as he pushed open 
the door nodding to the hideous negro who attired in the green livery 
worn by all the attendants of ravoni stood watching within the door 
m torniquet led byrnewood into the centre of the hall 

it was a long and narrow room with a lofty ceiling and snow-white floor 
it was lighted by five large windows on the western side and two on the 
southern end of the room the walls were white and bare and blank with 
out a solitary object to relieve their monotony of hue around the room 
between the windows and along the walls were placed some twenty oblong 
tables each standing in the full glare of the sunlight which poured freely 
over the ghastly spectacles peculiar to the place bending over each table 
was a young man whose long hair and characteristic look of frankness and 
recklessness combined betrayed the medical student of the quaker city 
at some of the tables were groups of two and three talking earnestly to 
gether knife in hand all the while and the whole body of students wore the 
same dark apron reaching to the shoulders and each arm was defended by 
a false sleeve of coarse muslin and on each table sweltering and fester- 
ing in the sunlight lay the remains of woman and child and a man here 
was a grisly trunk there an arm ttiere a leg and yonder a solitary hand 
occupied the attention of the student rare relics of the temple which 
yesterday enshrined a soul born of the living god 

here a ghastly head placed upright with the livid lips parted in a hideous 
grin received the gay light of the sun full on its glassy eyeballs there a 
mass of flesh and sinews and bones shone in the beams of the morning as 



the dissecting room 

corruption only can shine a soul once shone from those eyes a voice 
once spoke from those lips 

here lay an arm whose soft and beautiful outlines were terminated by a 
small and graceful hand and over the alabaster arm and the snowy hand 
the blue taint of decay spread like a foul curse turning loveliness into loath 
ing there in the full glare of the sunlight was spread a reeking trunk 
lopped short below the waist with loathsomeness and beauty combined in 
one horrible embrace the head had been severed and below the purple 
neck two white globes the bosom of what had once been woman were per 
ceptible in the light and the rainbow of corruption crept like a foul ser 
pent around that bosom for corruption has its rainbow and blue and 
red and purple and grey and pink and orange were mingled together on 
that trunk in one repulsive mass of decay and on this fair bosom hands 
of affection had been pressed or sweet young children had nestled or may 
be the white skin had crimsoned to a lover s kiss 

byrnewood passed slowly along the room gazing around in mingled 
wonder and loathing while the lively conversation of the students broke 
strangely on his ear 

 i say bob this must have been a jolly old chap cried a young gen 
tleman whose snub nose harmonized with his wide mouth and cross eyes 
 no doubt these lips have opened with several thousand jolly grins in their 
time now look at them pah how blue and livid 

and he tossed the head of the old man down upon the table twining his 
fingers in the white hairs while his knife severed the flesh from the brow 

 sweet girl this was once upon a time many a poor devil has been 
dying for love of her eyes and lips just now she dont look altogether love- 
able the eyes starting from their sockets and the lips falling to pieces 
and then the bosom ha he the scalpel makes love to it now 

and the sunbeams glistened upon the blade of the knife as it plyed brisk 
ly over the livid flesh 

 wonder how many people have shaken hands with this old fellow 
muttered another student with dark eyes and stiff lank black hair just 
look at this hand old and withered and hardened by toil how these 
cramped fingers have clutched at the dollars and the pennies ha ha 

 this woman wore a deuced pretty shoe i ll bet a dollar she did ex 
claimed a withered little man in a bald head and gold spectacles did 
ever you see such a foot and the toes and the instep and then what an 
ankle wonder who knit her stockings 

 he he he laughed a young student in tow-colored hair and a pear 
nose jist look at that good capital 

he had placed the mangled body of a dead man against the wall in a sit 
ting posture with the knees drawn up to the chin and the right hand fixed 
between one knee and the face with the fingers outspread and the thumb 






 ravoni the sorcerer 

pressed upon the nose in a gesture very much the vogue among dirty little 
boys rowdies and cabmen 

 is n t that the touch laughed the tow-haired student doesvt he 
say cant come it plain as chalk and then that eye half shut isvl 
the wink perfect 

 ha ha ho ho good capital chorused some dozen students 

and over the livid brow of the dead man who sat erect in this attitude of 
grotesque mockery streamed the yellow sunshine coloring the leaden eye 
balls and the hanging lip with hues of viviclgojd 

 there murmured doctor m torniquet who had been silent for the 
last few minutes there my boy you see the respect paid by living dust to 
dead ashes consoling sight is n t it 

 lead me from this place muttered byrnewood the air is foul with 
corruption i m in no mood to look upon scenes like these 

 come this way answered m torniquet ravoni is about to reveal 
his wonderful discovery in the amphitheatre 

opening a small door in one side of the dissecting room the doctor led 
byrnewood along a dark and narrow passage which terminated in another 
door pushing gently against this door a blaze of light streamed upon the 
passage and the doctor entered the amphitheatre with byrnewood at 
his side 

the vivid rays of a gas light streamed down upon the square table of the 
lecturer placed near the wall in the centre of the amphitheatre around 
and above this table rose thick tiers of benches arranged in the form of a 
half circle and ascending in easy gradation from the floor to the ceiling of 
the spacious room a partition of painted board separated the table of the 
lecturer from his audience and immediately in front was the main entrance 
to the amphitheatre forming an alley in the centre of the room with tiers 
of benches on either side 

the place was thronged by a dense array of spectators faces arose 
above faces from the floor to the ceiling some four or five hundred stu 
dents from the various medical schools of the quaker city had assembled 
in the lectore room anxious to witness the wonderful discovery announced 
by ravoni the singular mystery which enveloped the man his profuse 
charity to all poor students who came within his notice his enormous 
charges to the opulent class of medical aspirants the large mansion wnich 
he had furnished in a style of oriental magnificence the various strange 
stories which floated on the current of popular rumor in relation to his for 
mer life all these things combined had not only excited the curiosity of the 
students but of their masters the grave faces of doctor and professor 
were seen amid the reckless visages of long-haired sons of virginia and 
warthy striplings from alabama 

the devil-dare carolinian with his unstrapped boots resting on the next 
bench below his seat was companioned by the care-worn man of scienca 



the dissecting room 

with gold spectacles on his hooked nose the lean yankee the round-paced 
pennsylvanian the pale and emaciated youth of philadelphia the blustering 
hoosier from the far west all were mingled together in that motley crowd 
ravoni had announced a great discovery in medical science his tickets were 
free his invitation general to all the faculty and to every man and boy of 
the students under their care and therefore his lecture room was brim 
ming full 

byrnewood and mctorniquet found each a vacant seat close beside the 
lecturer s table scarce had they time to seat themselves and glance around 
when the green-baize door at the head of the principal passage which divided 
the lecture room in the centre was thrown suddenly open and two un 
couth men bearing a burden on their shoulders came forward with hurried 
footsteps 

they laid their burden on the table and every eye beheld the outlines of 
a corpse as it lay with its stiffened limbs concealed in the folds of a tattered 
white overcoat 

a light footstep was now heard from the narrow passage by which byrne- 
wood had entered and in an instant ravoni stood beside the table his sal 
low cheeks and thoughtful brow warming with a slight flush as the loud 
welcome of the audience broke like thunder on his ear 

ravoni gazed into the faces of the two men who stood before him their 
visages would have hung them in any christian community their faces 
had been unshaven for days and a stiff red beard mingling with the lank 
red hair that covered their foreheads gave a cut-throat look to each visage 
they stood with their eyes fixed upon the floor as though they feared to 
look into the face of a living man 

 from whence did you bring this subject said ravoni in a low whisper 

l from the poor man s grave in the alms-house grave-yard j answerer 
the tallest of the resurrectionists yer honor knows there s one grave 
which is the prope ty o the doctors any body what dies in the alms- 
house and hai nt got no friends to claim him is put into this grave and the 
d i himself may take him if he likes 

 ven yer honer s done with that body i should like to have my great 
coat again observed the short body-stealer in a mild and polite whisper 

we got the subject in the night sir and wrapped it up in that great 
coat and it hai nt been opened since hope it ill suit yer honer 

ravoni waved his hands and the body-stealers tramped out of the lecture 
room 

every eye was now centered upon ravoni some wild burst of his ac 
customed eloquence was anticipated some rhapsody which mingling the sub 
hme and the mystic would rouse the hearts of the auditors into wonder anc 
enthusiasm but no word passed from his lips in silence he proceeded tc 
jay bare the corpse glancing at the case of instruments placed on one 
corner of the table he slowly flung aside the tattered overcoat which envel 
oped the dead man 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

there was an awful silence every eye beheld the corpse and every 
heart grew cold with dread ravoni himself at the sight of that hideous 
spectacle started backward with a pale cheek and a trembling lip then the 
first awful pause of terror was past and a murmured cry of horror shook thlt 
room 

there there on the dissecting table lay the corpse its features set in death 
and its blue eye-balls glaring on the ceiling but it was not the subject antici 
pated by ravoni or his pupils from head to foot along the trunk and over 
each limb that corpse was all one cankering sore one loathsome blotch 
features on the face there were none brow and lip and cheek were all one 
hideous ulcer the eye-balls were spotted with clotted blood the mouth a 
cavern of corruption the very hair was thick with festering pollution i 
was the corpse of a man who had died from that terrible of all diseases the 
most infectious of all epidemics a curse at whose name beauty shudders and 
grave science grows pale thesmall-ppx better to look into the plague-pit 
where man and woman and babe lay mingled together one reeking mass 
of quick lime and gory flesh then to have gazed upon that corpse extended 
on the dissecting table before the eyes of five hundred living men 

every man in that room felt his danger as that ghastly sight dashed ice 
into his heart every man knew that there was infection in every breath he 
drew that there was a death linked with every atom that floated in the air 

ravoni stood silent and pale there he stood with eternal youth in his 
veins but in his twelve brief hours he might lay a foul thing of ulcers and 
blotches like the corse before his eyes for the common phases of this di 
sease there were remedies but let a single infectious atom breathed from 
the lips of a corse like this enter the lips of living man and no arm under 
god s sky could bring relief 

to lay a corse with no calm beauty speaking from the pale brow no 
gentle smile moulding the livid lips to lay a mass of gory flesh and stag 
nant blood to decay before your last hour to anticipate the rottenness of 
the grave while life yet lingers in your veins that thought paled eren 
the cheek of ravoni and the spectators doctors student and professor 
were spell-bound with a fear worse than death 

a wild cry of horror shook the room and then in one mass the audience 
rushed toward the door it was a living picture of a panic with one 
movement they swept from the benches with one bound they sprang into 
the narrow passage and then another wild cry added horror to the scene 
the main door opened into the room and the crowd blocked up against its 
panels were helpless as a child in a tiger s cage still ravoni stood silent 
and pale regarding the loathsome corse with a fixed stare 

then moving as one mass with a force like the impulse of a battering 
ram the dense throng rushed against the door crushing all who stood neai 
its panels unti they howled in very agony and then came another rush and 
another veil there was a wild crashing sound the door gave way 



the dissecting room 

splintered into fragments it fell before the living mass and through the open 
ed passage the panic-stricken crowd rushed from the place of death 

ravoni still was beside the corse the crowd was gene but a young 
man with long black hair and a flashing eye stood by his side it was 
tfyrnewood arlington he too had seen the crowd he too had looked upon 
he corse he too had felt some throbbings of the panic which like a heart 
of terror palpitated in the air of room but he still stood silent and firmtho 
ashy pale the doctor had fled from his side with an involuntary shriek 
of fear the face of the sorcerer himself had grown pale but the awful mys 
tery resting like a nightmare upon the soul of byrnewood arlington left no 
room for a lesser terror 

 thou hast a firm soul said ravoni in that low toned voice which was 
music to the ear that heard it thou hast a firm soul 

he laid his hand on byrnewood s shoulder as he spoke and the magnetic 
ray of his eye held the glance of the young man enchained to his own a 
strange sympathy for the being before him fluttered through byrnewood s 
heart 

thou hast a firm soul spoke the sorcerer and by my soul yes 
he added setting his teeth together while his eyes shone and his brow 
warmed with a sudden enthusiasm by the soul of ravoni thou shall be 
one of the chosen thou shalt be a priest of the faith 

the faith echoed young arlington 

 the new faith which shall arise over the ashes of the creeds and su 
perstitions of this day the faith which dwelt in the hearts of men ere 
the sword of the jew or the cross of the christian or the crescent of the 
sorcerer arose on the horizon of man s soul scattering pestilence and death 
wherever they flashed or shone that faith buried for long long centu 
ries which man in the olden time in the world s youth of promise loved and 
cherished which raised him to godhead and made the universe itself his 
own that faith will we raise from the grim ruins of fable and superstition 
and the old faith revised and re-created shall be our new religion of hope 
to man 

the words of the sorcerer were wild and strange but his look and tone 
were lightning and music to byrnewood s soul he was awed he was fas- 
cinated slowly he reached forth his arm and with his eyes fixed on the 
eyes of ravoni he seized the sorcerer by the hand 

 this hour shalt thou behold the dead arise exclaimed avoni with 
his deep dark eyes alive with the rays of magnetic power come 

 ho ho ho laughed a rough voice the doctor and the students 
all skeered to death by a bundle o small pox woders how that ill vurk 

and hurrying from the secret passage devil-bug emerged into the light 
his distorted face convulsed with sneering knghter and his solitary eye 
twinkling in hideous glee while his tangled hah fell thickly over his pro 
uberant brow 



wft ravon the sorcerer 

byrnewood started at the sound of that voice he advanced toward the 
savage devil-bug beheld him and turned pale 

 what he shouted another sperrit come to ha nt me ho ho 
there be a miliskey muster of em arter a while there there lays 
the man with his jaw broke and his tongue lollin out there right at my 
feet is the old woman with the blood a droppin from the holler skull- but 
this feller 

with his talon fingers extended he turned aside his head while his frame 
quivered with emotion 

 i have seen you before cried byrnewood laying his hand on the arm 
of the monster i have seen you and 

 a sperrit could n t grip me that way muttered devil-bug i see how 
it is he escaped from the well tho the boards cracked from under him 
and here he is with his ricollecshun destroyed by the drug 

 i have seen you before repeated byrnewood in a whispered voice in 
audible to ravoni tell me oh tell me 

he would have demanded his sister of the savage but a wild laugh 
drowned his words 

 you ve seen me afore werry likely young man public charact rs 
like the president and me is to be seen most any day in the week by sich 
persons as likes and then my name young man my name is pecooliar 
you know it among ten thousand my riame is sich a sing lar one it s 
jones young man nothin but jones 

 madman muttered ravoni advancing do you trifle in my 
presence away and to your watch see that no one enters the cham- 
oer beside whose door t placed you this morning begone 

devil-bug trembled beneath the glance of his eye like a raven who dreads 
he attack of an eagle he slunk quietly into the secret passage and in a 
noment was gone 

 come said ravoni in a whisper as he placed byrraewood s arm 
within his own you shall behold the miracle 

ten thousand thoughts whirled through byrnewood s brain the grief 
of his father and mother the myster -h enveloped the fate of his sister 
and then the sweet smiling face of thlt r with her brown hair waving 
along her rose-bud cheeks all were pit vith him and his soul was a 
chaos with uncertain gleams of light play ver the summit of tossing 
clouds but the eyes of ravoni were fixed b i im he felt his veins fire 
nd his heart kindle as that glare shot into his l ike a ay of light from 
the eternal world 

 i go with you he whispered and his pale cfk wed with a new 
fire and his dark eye gathered a strange light 



the first miracle of the new faith 

chapter sixth 

the first miracle of the new faith 

the taint of corruption and the breath of incense the shrouded fornr of 
he dead and the dark-robed figure of the sorcerer the commanding forehead 
over-arching eyes that sent forth rays of majestic power and the pale brows 
of enthusiasts lit by eyes hollow with watching and flashing with unnatural 
light these all were there in that chamber of the new faith 

it was a spacious chamber circular in shape with lofty walls and a wide 
celling which in the centre arose into a dome from this dome a star of 
burning light flung its lustre down over the centre of the chamber while 
from the dim shadows of the room white columns of incense wound slowly 
upward like the hope of a true soul gleaming through the darkness of irs 
despair 

in the centre of that chamber all was light while beyond save the snowy 
columns of incense all was darkness and in the centre of the chamber 
beneath the moon-like radiance of the light falling from the dome was a 
strange and fearful spectacle more like a wild dream on a picture of some 
olden-time tradition than a plain and palpable reality 

an altar white as snow arose in the light with its drapery falling in gen 
tle folds down to the sable floor on one side of the altar calm and impas 
sable stood ravoni gazing intently upon the faces of twenty-four young men 
who sate grouped along the floor on the opposite side their eyes enchained 
to his glance with a singular intensity 

these young men were students gleaned by ravoni from the various 
medical schools and from the haunts and nooks of the wide city the light 
shone over haggard faces high pale foreheads well developed in the ideal 
organs and white hands tremblingly grasping rolls of manuscript there 
was a wild light shining from the eyes of every one of the twenty-four a 
fixed glare a feverish and unhealthy brightness it was the meteor light of 
fanaticism their careless attire their long hair flung loosely over each 
shoulder fheir fixed gaze and their statue-like stillness all betrayed the 
absorbing and painful interest with which they awaited the words of the sor 
cerer 

and among the foremost pale and wild as the palest and wildest of thero 
all sate byrnewood arlington he too gazed upon the face of ravoni with 
a woven brow and flashing eye his hands were convulsively clasped upon 
his knees and his under lip was pressed between his teeth 

and on the altar lay a stiffened corpse whose outlines were dimly seen 
through the folds of a white cloth flung lightly over each icy limb there 
vas beauty in that corpse and grace for the cloth was morlded into soft 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

folds as though it veiled a woman s form the feet were thrust upward the 
arms folded over the chest and the globes of the bosom rose gently in the 
light even beneath their thick disguise the face like the form was veilea 
from the gaze yet the outlines of a countenance which death had only made 
more sternly beautiful were clear and apparent 

ravoni stood by the altar and the corpse his slight form clad in robes of 
deep sable while his long black hair fell wild and lank about his shoulders 
there was an unusual expression stamped upon his face not manifested in 
deed in any violent working of the muscles or sudden contortion of the 
features all was calm and yet it was a calm full of omen the scornful 
lips pressed lightly together the nostrils quivering with a scarcely percepti 
ble motion the forehead high wide and massive impressed with a look of 
conscious mind and the eyes dark full and thoughtful glaring a light that 
sent forth rays like a star there was a silent intensity of thought revealed 
in every line of that pale countenance 

and the light from the dome streamed over the dark robes and pale brow 
of ravoni over the white cloth which revealed the outlines of the corpse 
and upon the faces of the students who sate waiting in awed silence for the 
words of their master while up from the dark corners of the room curled 
the white incense strewing the air with grateful perfume and the shadows 
with scarfs of snowy mist 

ravoni gazed upon the faces of the students and then his lips moved but 
no sound broke upon the air 

he was about to make a dread and awful experiment not with machinery 
of wood or iron or with the air or the lightning in its bosom or with the 
aarth or the secrets of its depths but with something more terrible than all 
the soul of man 

for a moment a voice seemed whispering in his ear a voice speaking 
from the invisible world to his soul words of strange import 

 ravoni there is a god ravoni there is a god blaspheme not his 
name 

in a low and musical tone he spoke of the new faith while the voice 
within was whispering unceasingly to his soul 

 there has been too much of god were the first words he uttered 
 there has been too much of god in all the creeds of the world where- 
ever fanaticism has raised its fanes there the name of god has beeu 
mouthed by the foul lips of priests 

 the hindoo mother gives her child to the ganges in the name of god 
and the car of juggernaut crushes its thousands who shriek that name as 
they are mingled in one gory massacre 

 the torch of st bartholemew was lit in the name of god the fair fields 
of ireland have been soaked with the blood of her children while that name 
-hrieked in every musket shot europe has been desolated in the name of 



the first miracle of the new faith 

god in a single foul and atrocious war nine million souls went down to 
one bloody grave because they did not believe with their king that the god- 
head centered in a paltry wafer the name of god was shrieked by booted 
troopers and cowled priests over their desolate hearth-sides over a land rich 
in graves and blood 

 in this fair land of the new world the children of the forest were hunted 
and butchered in the name of god it mingled with cry of death and it 
shrieked in tne blood-hounds yell helpless women and aged men were 
burnt by grim sectarians who gazed upon the blackened flesh of their vic 
tims and shouted glory to the name of god 

 in this name earth has been desolated ten thousand times and ten thou 
sand times again in this name home has been made a hell the gardens of 
the world transformed into howling deserts the heart of man changed into a 
devil in this name blood has flown in rivers and in this name earth hag 
been made a pest-house with its valleys levelled into plains and its hills 
raised into mountains with the heaps of dead 

 these things have been done in the name of god you may say that 
they were the work of ignorance of superstition of fanaticism but still that 
blistering fact stands out from the history of the world these crimes were 
done in the name of god 

 now and his voice rose into a tone of absorbing enthusiasm while 
his white hand undulated over the corpse now aye now the time haa 
come when something for man should be done in the name of man 

a wild murmur of applause trembled from lip to lip the dark eyes of 
the twenty-four enthusiasts shone with the wild light of fanaticism 

byrnevvood arlington leaned forward with flashing eyes and parted lips 
while he felt his soul drawn to ravoni by a strange yet irresistible sympa 
thy ever and anon his eye wandered to the corse and with a shudder 
he withdrew his gaze from the spectacle of death a dim suspicion crept 
over him that the form of his sister lay on that altar a lifeless corse it 
was a horrible thought and in his soul he knew it false and baseless yet 
whenever he glanced upon the white cloth which shrouded the face of the 
dead it was his sister that lay there 

 in the name of man and for the good of man shall our new faith arise 
exclaimed ravoni in his deep toned voice yet think not that ravoni de 
nies god no no over the body of the dead i preach unto you a pure 
and merciful god through all matter through sun and sky and earth and 
air he lives the soul of the universe we are all beams of his light rays 
of his sun as imperishable as his own glory to us all he has entrusteq 
powers awful and sublime think not because these powers may never b 
manifested that they do not exist they are all in us and in us for good 

 all men from the slave to the prince from the dull boor to the man of 
genius are connected with each other by an universal sympathy an invisi- lt 
ble influence on which souls float and undulate like rays in the sunshiny 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

air this influence or sympathy call it what you will is the atmosphere 
of souls the life of intellects 

 some men absorbing a larger portion of this invisible life than others 
become men of genius warriors or statesmen 

 and through the long and drear and bloody history of this world are 
recorded instances of mighty souls who appeared on the earth gifted with 
powers that made men worship them as gods these men were thoroughly 
imbued with the atmosphere in which the soul breathes thoughts of god-ship 
these intellects were known as saviours prophets reformers they were 
distinguished by an irresistible power which beaming from the brow or flash 
ing from the eye awed and subdued the souls of the million these men 
demonstrated the great truth that the awful soul having created us hath 
 left us all to our own salvation or our ruin as we shall by our deeds deter 
mine thus we shape our own destinies that we are the masters of our own 
lives that we by developing the mysteries implanted in our bosoms may 
walk the earth superior to the clay around us each man a god in soul 

vain were it to depict that outstretched hand that flashing eye that look 
and port of mystery as one man the twenty-four students rose to their 
feet and a dark-eyed youth tossed his arms wildly on high and muttered 
with white lips ravoni is a god ravoni is a god 

and the murmur broke over the throng in a whisper full of meaning 
ravoni is a god ravoni is a god 

the light from the dome fell over the sorcerer the corse and the enthu 
siasts while up from the shadows of the chamber wound the columns of 
snowy incense 

 as ye all may be gods so am i a god as ye all may look into the 
josom of the universe and make the secrets of nature your own train the 
lightnings to your will and sweep the souls of men in adoration at your feet 
so have i done 

 and you my chosen priests will i bind together in a high and solemn 
brotherhood as the first ministers at the altars of the faith in silence and 
in mystery will we compass the wide land selecting our converts from the 
mass as we shall know them worthy of our mysteries and adding them 
one by one to our holy brotherhood no loud prayers in the tinselled 
church no vapid trumpetings of our godliness from street to corners but 
slowly and silently and in power will we work for the new faith built in 
the name of man for the good of man 

well had ravoni chosen his converts from the young the hopeful the en- 
thusiastic his words uttered in that deep music of tone which mingling 
vith the syllables of speech can allure the human soul to good or evil 
struck the mysterious chords of every heart they were no longer tne 

 it may be presumed that a reference is intended to the doctrine of magnetic influence 
pervading all apace and linking man to man and man to god by the same awful and 
immutable power 



the first miracle of the new faith 

same men every face was stamped with an excitement that corded the 
reins on the forehead and fired the eyes with a blaze like that which stream 
ed from the dark orbs of ravoni it was a terrible picture of fanaticism 

 we are thine they shouted in one voice raising their hands in the 
light we are thine 

byrnewood arlington was no more himself he stood amid that throng 

with an eye blazing and a hand uplifted we are thine he joined in the v 
chorus of fanatics am thine he shouted in a voice that rolled to the 
dome above am thine 

there was silence for a moment a picture of sorcery death and 
fanaticism the form of ravoni with the uplifted hand the throng of 
frenzied enthusiasts and the still corse of the dead on the brow of ravoni 
sat calmness and grandeur while his eye shone with a brightness all its own 
the still corse in its stern quietude presenting an emblem of rest the fan 
atics crowding in a group with uplifted hands joined together and faces quiv 
ering with emotion while the soft light showered down upon the scene from 
he dome overhead and the incense ascended evermore from the dim sha 
dows of the chamber 

 ye shall witness a proof of my power exclaimed ravoni you all 
behold the corse laid prostrate on this altar when this corse arises from 
the sleep of death then shall our faith commence its reign 

a murmur of wonder interrupted the word of the sorcerer 

 i tell you the dead shall arise exclaimed ravoni and then in short 
md vivid sentences he described the mysteries of life and death 

as f nought after thought fell from his lips his manner grew more ani- 
nated the interest of his hearers more intense his treatment of the sub 
ject munifested mnense research combined with ingenius sophistry now 
baling in wild rharsody and now giving one of his points of argument all 
-he clearness of a mathematical demonstration he averred in plain terms 
hat the dead might be raised to life he dimly insinuated a belief in the 
principle of eternal youth and then gave a cursory yet forcible glance at 
the long history of the search after a universal solvent which would change 
he baser metals into solid gold 

his hearers were wrapt silent and motionless every point of his argu 
ment stood displayed before them like a palpable thing 

 i will laise the dead before your eyes he exclaimed yet again as he 
surveyed the faces of his auditors it is now within five minutes of noon- 
aay at the hour of noon the corse before you shall arise 

then folding his arms across his breast he strode slowly up and down 
the floor beside the altar now was the moment for his face to manifest an 
agitation tenfold more powerful than the emotion displayed by the most en 
thusiastic of the students that frowning brow beneath which the half-hid- 
den eyeball gleamed with fixed and glassy light that lip quivering w th a 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

tremulous motion those white hands clutching nervously at the chest ou 
it be that the sorcerer fears the failure of his magic in this his hour of trial 

in silent wonder the students resumed their seats and a young man be 
side byrnewood took forth his watch and noted the seconds as they 
fled with a wild and haggard eye 

a minute passed 

byrnewood gazed vacantly upon the veiled corse and muttered incoherent- 
ly to himself am i dreaming why does he not lift the cloth from the 
face of the dead 

and then as in very fear that the lifting of the cloth might reveal his sis- 
ter s face he turned his head aside and shaded his eyes with his hand not 
a word passed from the lips of the enthusiasts all was silent as the grave 

the second minute passed 

ravoni approached the corse ha he will lift the cloth at last jt 
muttered byrnewood starting from his seat the sorcerer placed his hand 
beneath the veil and drew forth into the light the fingers of an icy hand 
 how dead and cold 

again he resumed his walk beside the altar again the students sank back 
into quivering suspense 

 lift the shroud from the face of the dead gasped byrnewood and then 
is if startled by the sound of his own voice he shuddered and grew pale 

ravoni advanced to the corse again slowly slowly he lifted up the 
grave-cloth first the face was visible then the neck and bosom then the 
body of the corse and then the limbs dead dead cold and dead white 
yes as the stainless snow pure aye pure as god s own light 

why did that yell die in byrnewood s throat what fiend was it that 
choked the agony as it gurgled up from his heaving chest whose hot 
fingers were those that burnt his eyeballs why might he not gaze steadi 
ly at the sight why did his eyes swim in fiery moisture why did his 
brain burn as with a red hot iron pressing against the bare skull one mo 
ment and the next grow icy cold 

the students rose up in silent astonishment in wrapt wonder 

it was the corse of a young and beautiful woman there was a smile on 
the lips a calm glory beaming from the face around whose swelling out 
lines a warm mass of golden hair curled and twined and glistened the 
round arms folded on the breast the white fingers gently clasped and the 
snowy bosom with the blue threaded veins that bosom whose fulness be 
spoke the mother ah death was there in holy beauty fairer form than 
that did painter never shape sweeter limbs than those did sculptor nevet 
carve 

yet she was dead ah cold and dead and the light streamed warmly 
over the marble whiteness of that uncovered form revealing beauties on 
which the worms were soon to riot over the round limbs over the white 
bosom over the beaming face the worms would crawl marking their pro- 



the first miracle of the new faith 

gress with the blue taint of decay and ravoni could raise this corse to 
life again mockery of mockeries 

one cry shrieked from the students lips 

 raise the dead to life ravoni raise the dead to life and we will wor 
ship thee 

his arms resting on his knees his face half veiled in his hands byrne- 
wood chuckled to himself with an idiot laugh 

it was not his sister it was not mary that delusion had vanished the 
delusion was over but the reality was there 

in that corse byrnewood beheld the form of annie the poor man s 
daughter the seduced the mother it is a dream chuckled byrnewood 
with an idiot laugh i am haunted by her corse it is a dream the 
student by his side picked up the watch which had fallen to the floor 

three minutes had past 

not a word was spoken as motionless as silent as pale as the corpse 
itself the students clustered round the altar 

 ha suddenly whispered one enthusiast to another do you mark 
that faint color in the cheek 

 silence muttered the other student there is no color there yet 
ha do you not see the bosom heave 

it was all fancy no color gave warmth to the cheek no throb of life 
swelled the white bosom 

another long and weary minute past each second told by the gasping 
breath of the awed enthusiasts one minute alone remained 

 restore the dead ravoni muttered one of the students restore the 
dead or thou art false even as yon corpse is cold 

the sorcerer stood silently regarding the body of the dead girl hia 
face was fearfully calm but his dark eyes blazed with a terrible light 

on this miracle i peril my soul cried ravoni between his set teeth 

one half minute is all that is left thee whispered a dark browed stu 
dent in a voice tremulous with the agony of suspense 

ravoni extended his hand it was white as marble and the beaded sweat 
glistened along the slender fingers 

 arise ye dead he muttered and pressed his lips to the clay cold lips 
of the corpse 

a wild murmur of fear from the whole band of students a murmur and 
a start and then a fearful silence 

the cheeks of the dead had warmed with rosy life the bosom heaved and 
one hand moved gently to and fro 

 arise ye dead shrieked ravoni with the cold sweat on his brow 

 arise ye dead 

the hand of the dead girl was slowly raised flushes of warmth ran over 
ne limos the eyelids began to unclose 
 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 arise ye dead arise arise for the third time i bid thee arise 

one shuddering start of horror 

the body of the dead girl quivered the bosom heaved the limbs shook 
then a shudder ran over her frame and with a convulsive start the bodj 
rose on one arm the eyelids unclosed and the blue eyes gazed wonderinglj 
around 

 hail hail ravoni we worship thee 

raising himself from his idiotic stupor as that shout burst on his ear byrne - 
wood rushed through the group he beheld the uncovered form of the gir 
warming with life he saw the blue eyes gazing around with a look of wild 
bewilderment 

 annie he shouted and sank kneeling beside the altar his head drop 
ped on her bosom his arms encircled her form he was stiff and cold and 
lifeless as marble 

the fair girl gazed round upon the group her blue eyes swimming in 
frenzy 

 my child she murmured extending her hands with a maniac smile 
 where have you taken my child 



chapter seventh 

ravoni and mabel 

it was one o clock when a dashing carriage with cream colored panels 
and a liveried driver came rattling along the street and halted suddenly in 
front of the house of ravoni the bay horses were all a-foam with exer 
tion and their harness was covered with dust they had evidently been 
driven at a most unreasonable speed and now they struck the hard stones 
with their fore feet and tossing their long manes on the air manifested their 
impatience by a long and quivering neigh 

the carriage door was thrown open and fitz-cowles sprang out upon the 
pavement he was attired in a dark travelling over-coat copiously adorned 
with frogs and braid and he still flourished his gold-headed cane in his right 
hand 

 come on parson he exclaimed glancing within the carriage door 

 you know i must send the girl on to new york to-night there is no 
time to lose she shall accompany me to england he muttered between 
his teeth but dora ha ha she must not know a word about it come 
on parson 

 wait responded that well-known voice from within the carriage 
 wait till i compose my features into the proper patent gospel look now 
fitz how does that go saintly enough eh 

tne good dr pyne stepped from the carriage and taking fitz-cowles 
arm within his own ascended the marble steps of the yellow house he 



the first miracle of the new faith 

rang the bell with a godly smile his eyes were turned up and the corners 
of his mouth were turned down while his soul seemed to be meditating upon 
the unfortunate state of the unconverted hindoos 

in a moment the hideous face of abhar was visible in the door- way 

 i would speak with the signior ravoni said dr pyne bowing to the 
mass of ugliness with an air of deep deference 

the negro pointed toward the main stair-way and then closing the front 
door left dr pyne and his friend to make the best of their way to the audi 
ence chamber of ravoni they ascended the stair-way and stood at the 
commencement of the entry on the second floor which was dimly illumined 
by a small window in the southern wall passing along the entry they 
well-nigh stumbled over a dark object which was laid in front of a door 
fashioned into the western wall of the corridor 

hello parson what s that ejaculated fitz-cowles does the old 
conjurer lay traps for a man s feet in this way 

 never mind let s see to the girl grumbled the parson as he spoke 
they entered the audience chamber of ravoni the noon-day sun came 
faint and dimly through the thick curtains that obscured the lofty windows 
the place was full of gloom and shadow and the thickly carpeted floor gave 
no echo to the footsteps of the intruders 

 i say we re alone muttered fitz-cowles this cursed den really 

makes a fellow shiver black ceiling black curtains black carpet -ugh 

where s the sorcerer 

 he will be along presently muttered dr pyne in a bland whisper 
 now fitz suppose we could get the little maiden away from this den 
without the sorcerer s knowledge 

 it would be vastly convenient 

va-s-tly save all disagreeable explanations ha hum what s 
this 

approaching the western side of the audience chamber his eye was fixed 
upon a ray of red light which streamed from a crevice in the dark curtain 
ing a grim smile broke over the preacher s visage 

 look here fitz he whispered the entrance to another room i 
vow he slowly swung the dark curtains aside and gazed thro the 
aperture while a blaze of light streamed over his round visage and the 
swarthy face of his companion 

 look there my boy chuckled pyne with a fat parson s chuckle fitz- 
cowles applied his gold headed cane to his lips and muttered in a distinct 
tone the monosyllable dam biting it off short like an epicure tasting a 
delicious morsel 

along the dark entry and up the dim stairway ravoni had led the tremb 
ling mabel as with her heart fluttering with a new emotion she expected to 
behold her father s face and rest upon her father s bosom for the first time 
in he dreary hie of suffering and wrong 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

 i shall behold my father at last she said gazing over her shoulder 
with a soft light beaming from her dark eyes 

 thou shall answered ravoni in a tone that trembled with emotion 
 enter this door a little while and thou shall rest in thy father s arms 
he pushed her gently through a small door fashioned in the western wall 
of the corridor mabel looked around in wonder she was alone she 
slood in a large chamber wilh a trembling light burning on a small table 
near its centre the light was faint and dim yet it served to disclose the 
gorgeous furniture of the place the silken hangings falling from the lofty 
ceiling to the carpeted floor the glitlering mirrors the chairs the sofa and 
the dark mantel adorned with figures of spotless alabaster 

 and this is my father s home muttered mabel sinking into a cushioned 
arm-chair beside the table in the centre of the room she clasped her 
hands and gazed silently around ihe place her father s home gor 
geous furniture crimson curtains carpets that gave no echo to the footstep 
massive mirrors and a cheerful fire burning on a wide hearth scattering 
warmth and comfort round this was a gorgeous home for thee poor or 
phan but its glory in thy sight had been nothing were it not for the thought 
that a father s heart throbbed within those lofty walls 

my father s home she murmured again and then fell into a waking 
dream which glided away into a soft and dreamless sleep when she 
awoke some unknown hand had substituted large wax lights for the tremb 
ling lamp and placed refreshments on the table by her side 

 will he soon return the whisper broke from her lips and then turn 
ing round she listened to a faint murmur that broke on her ear it required 
a moment for her eye to grow accustomed to the darkness which shrouded 
the farther corners of the room and then with a start she fancied she beheld 
two faces peering grimly upon her through an aperture in the crim 
son hangings 

 it is all fancy she muttered turning her face away from the sight 
 it cannot be my persecutor here at least i am safe from his violence 

there was the sound of a hurried footstep mabel started to her feet in 
fear and ere she could look around she felt the folds of the dark robe 
which she wore drawn closely about her limbs while a hoarse laugh broke 
on her ear 

 ho ho my bird have i caughl you you will run away from 
your kind father will you for shame f-o-r shame 

mabel looked up and beheld the red round visage of dr pyne with the 
swarthy countenance of a stranger peering over his shoulder she buried 
her face in her hands while her heart grew cold with despair 

 come my canary bird cried dr pyne gathering his arms tightly 
around her form no strugglin no screamin d ye hear 

he wound the dark robe more closely around her form compressing hei 
hands and limbs as within the embrace of a vice 



ravoni and mabel 

 pretty bi-jove pretty muttered fitz-cowles as he unwound the 
black silk scarf from his neck and tied it round her head and over her 
mouth you ve a kind pa-pa my dear and you ve treated him quite rude 
ly but we ll take care of you my love depend upon it we will 

he raised her in his arms and bore her toward the entrance while dr 
d yne followed smilingly at his heels 

i feel good all over he muttered rubbing his fat hands together 
 to think of my dear daughter returning to the parental roof oh good- 
less what a consoler that thought is 

and you a poor broken-hearted father chuckled fitz-cowles as he 
bore the maiden through the audience chamber 

they entered the dark entry mabel uttered neither sigh nor moan nor 
struggled to free her limbs from the arms of fitz-cowles a strange 
apathy of despair had chilled her soul she yielded to her fate like the pale 
consumptive who counts the few hours of existence on some dreary sick 
bed while every minute crumbles away a clod from the edges of the grave 

 to the carriage muttered fitz-cowles to the carriage and our 
beauty is safe 

the words had not passed his lips when his foot became entangled in 
some dark object resting along the floor he fell forward while dr pyne 
seized the maiden from his grasp 

 come fitz we must hurry exclaimed pyne when he felt himself 
grasped by the throat and bruised violently in the back at the same moment 
unloosing his grasp which pinioned the maiden s form he howled in 
very agony 

and then two stalwart arms grasped him by the neck and two uncivil 
feet tripped up his heels with the precision and regularity of clock-work in 
an instant dr pyne felt himself rolling down the stairs he made an effort 
to stay his mad career at the first landing but in vain he rolled over the 
landing and then down the four and thirty stairs like a bundle of cotton 
with bones in it the reverend preacher bumped and rolled and rolled and 
bumped again 

he had lain at the foot of the stairway for the space of a moment or more 
full of groans and aches when a heavy body whizzed through the air and 
the reverend doctor felt himself hit in the paunch by the form of a full 
grown man which came bounding down the stairs with the velocity of a young 
colt 

 oh my god groaned pyne who did that 

 what in the d d ye mean roared the voice of fitz-cowles what 
in the d d ye mean by layin here at the foot of the stairs for people to 
break their bones over you hey 

 and what do you mean by comin down stairs like a flyin fish or a 
bomb shell curse it there ai nt h whole bone in me 

at the head of the stairway in the full glare of the light streaming through 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

the small window stood a wild and distorted form with thick locks of 
matted hail falling aside from a hideous countenance all a-flame with an 
expression of super-human rage 

fitz-cowles and pyne felt the glare of a solitary eye flashing down upon 
them like the eye of a coiled snake darting from the orbless socket of a skull 

 did i smash you ye born devils roared the hoarse voice of devil-bug 
 you thought you d steal off with the gal and then you thought the bundle 
o blackness on the floor was nt nothin ho ho did i trundle the par 
son down stairs and hit him in the paunch with the dandy ho ho i 
wonders how it verks 

 come parson we d better go said fitz-cowles that incarnate fiend 
seems to mix himself up with every-body s affairs come 

 oh o o-o-o i wish he had nt mixed you up with me so confoundedly 

groaning and aching parson pyne followed fitz-cowles to his carriage 

five minutes passed with the cold sweat standing in thick beads on his 
forehead fresh from scenes of super-human horror ravoni passed up the 
stair- way his arms folded on his breast and his dark eyes buried beneath 
the interwoven brows 

at the head of the stairway the light from the circular window streamed 
over a strange and impressive picture a monster in human shape knelt on 
the floor with the form of a fair and beautiful girl resting unconsciously upon 
his knee his solitary eye was fixed upon her snow-white face and his 
rough hands gathered her torn robe over her alabaster bosom ravoni 
started and then stood like some statue of wild and mysterious astonish 
ment gazing unperceived upon the scene 

 yer dead gal yer dead muttered the monster and a big tear started 
from his eye and they tuk yo from me and stole yo away and hid yo 
the dogs and devils yer dead gal but i ll buy me sich knives and pis- 
tols to cut and slash yer enemies to pieces that they ll wish the devil had 
em a thousand times oh yer dead yer dead 

his rough hand was passed over her smooth cheek as if to wake her 
gently to life again and then he moaned in a low and broken tone yer 
dead gal yes yes yer dead 

ravoni was touched by this strange spectacle there was something in 
the voice the look the manner of the savage that thrilled the very heart 
strings of this mysterious man 

ascending the last step of the stairs he touched devil-bug gently on the 
shoulder what does this mean he said in a low-toned voice 

devil- bug looked up with a scowl on his grim face but it melted away 
before the deep glance of ravoni s dark eyes had the sorcerer indeed 
made his will the soul of this monster 

 why yo see said devil-bug in a submissive tone i did nt dream 
when i lay watchin besfde the door that my pretty little nell was the gal 
either not a bit of it an while i was watchin in comes parson pyne 



ravoni and mabel 

an a dandy with him an they carries off the gal thro the door leadin into 
the aud ence room they brings her this way the dogs did nt i rise on 
em did nt pitch the parson down stairs with the dandy a-top of him 
ho ho 

 and so you know the girl asked ravoni with his dark eyes fixed upon 
he visage of devil-bug 

 know the gal exclaimed the savage lt i tell you she s the child of 
he rich marchant she s the daughter o livingstone 

a sneering smile wreathed the lips of the sorcerer 

 i have heard this story before parson pyne told me all the girl is 
a maniac she fancies d ye mark she fancies that she is the child of 
livingstone 

devil-bug was nettled by the cold tone of ravoni 

 is them fancy he cried drawing a pacquet of papers from his coarse 
garment 

 is them papers wot proves it all as straight as a b c is them fancy 
let me put em in livingstone s hands venders how that ud verk 

ravoni leaned slowly forward keeping the glance of his impenetrable eye 
fixed upon the face of the savage 

 it is all nonsense he said in a jeering tone and then cooly reaching 
forth his hands he took the pacquet from the grasp of devil-bug here 
is gold for you my fellow leave these papers with me i shall not want 
you again until to-morrow 

devil-bug s arms dropped by his side the gold pieces rattled on the 
floor 

 look here man or devil whatever yo are i m ugly as a sarpint and 
i ve stole dead bodies for you and may-be i d murder for you if you paid 
me well but i can t take gold for them papers this gal s life and fortin 
an name is locked up there in that package give it to me i say and i ll 
be yer slave for life 

he lifted his huge hands beseechingly as he spoke his rough voice 
was quivering and tremulous as the tones of a child cold calm and im 
penetrable ravoni gazed upon him his dark eyes gleaming with those awful 
rays which were magic and power 

 your object is gold he slowly said you shall have it the papers 
and the girl are mine 

he raised the fainting form of mabel from the knee of devil -bug and with 
his foot thrust open the door of the western chamber 

 begone he exclaimed with his hand pointing toward the stair-way i 
shall want you to-morrow begone slave 

he disappeared within the room and closed the door devil-bug stricken 
dumb with awe and astonishment rose on his feet he moved slowly toward 
the stair- way 

lt and she is to be one of his nuns he muttered between his teeth 



po ravoni the sorcerer 

 to-night she s pure as one o god s angels to-morrow morning she l 
be foul -foul there ai nt a trull along the streets fouler than this child 
will be and yet i m his slave ha ha he ses and i must do why 
did nt he bid me tear my bare arm with my teeth but to give my child to 
him to him to lay sich a butterfly in a spider s nest and he ll give 
me gold for her gold 

it was awful to see the malignity of hell gleaming from every line of that 
distorted countenance the solitary eye stood out from the socket blazing 
with a glaring lustre the lips writhed and worked over the clenched teeth 
and yet whenever he thought of ravoni a cold chill quivered through his 
deformed body he could fight with a man yes he could grapple with 
phantoms from the grave but ravoni the deep dark eyes of the sorcerer 
were forever before him their awful rays pouring into his soul 

one word broke from his writhing lips 

 monk-hall 

yes he would bury himself in the nooks and corners of the accursed man 
sion in the dim shadows of that hall of death and crime hissoul would find 
such comfort as the grave-worm finds when revelling over the hollow skull 
darkness to darkness guilt to guilt the ghost to its haunt the murderer to 
his den 

 monk-hall he muttered and then departed from the house of ravoni 
on one side wriggled and crawled the man with the broken jaw and lolling 
tongue on the other the old woman glided with the blood oozing from the 
hollow skull the groan of the man and the sound of the woman s patter 
ing blood mingled together but what were these horrors to the thought which 
burnt like a hot iron through his brain his child in the arms of pollution 
and shame 

fitz-cowles stood beside his cream-colored carriage the groans of the 
bruised dr pyne came through the open door and the bay horses struck 
their hoofs impatiently against the stones of the street fitz-cowles stood 
with one foot on the carriage steps when his brow grew dark with sudden 
thought he started back upon the pavement and stood with folded arms 
and his cane raised to his lips 

 all is safe thus ran his wandering thoughts this morning i sent 
the hair trunk and all my other baggage to new-york under an assumed 
name public curiosity is still alive in regard to the forgery and yet no 
one suspects me i stand clear as the day among the aristocracy of the 
quaker city von gelt is gone no accomplice can now mutter treasor 
with regard to his master dim my creole slave has orders to have two 
of the best horses to be had in this town for love or money ready saddled 
and bridled to-night in the wood beyond camden with these horses dora 
and i will escape from hawkewood bye the bye she must take care to 
have all her jewellery with her i must make something by this woman 



ravoni and mabel 

must turn her fancy for a coronet into good fitz-cowles gold all there- 
fore is fair day with me and what should i fear 

 what should i fear he muttered aloud and ere the words had died on 
his lips a dark presentiment crept thro his blood while i stand here 
this man harvey may be laying some infernal plot to blow all my schemes 
in the air that would be a pretty spectacle as i am about to leave the 
city to-night to feel an offcer s finger on my shoulder you are my pris 
oner sir ugh i have not seen harvey to-day this silence annoys me 
poodle gave me aliint that harvey was on the track of the jew yesterday 
zounds could he have seen that rascal before his death 

fitz-cowles was troubled his lip was compressed and his swarthy 
face grew darker with a settled frown 

 drive to my rooms parson he whispered through the carriage door 
 i will join you there in an hour 

the carriage door closed on a curse which broke from the parson s lips 
as his fat frame writhed beneath the agony of manifold bruises and the 
vehicle rattled away along the street 

 i will go to monk-hall he muttered i will spy out the secrets of 
the den and if the jew made any communication to harvey before his 
death i will know it ere this day is gone by ha here is that fool 
mulhill 

and with a smile on his red visage the redoubtable major rappahannock 
mulhill came lounging lazily along the street twirling an enormous crooked 
stick in one hand while the other was inserted in the capacious pocket of 
his pantaloons 

 the costume of the major you will remember was striking and peculiar 
a broad brimmed felt hat with a blue cord and tassel a white blanket 
over-coat which was thrown open in front revealing a sky-blue coat with 
metal buttons a deep red velvet vest and a pair of pants made very full and 
striped like bed ticking brimstone kid gloves and patent leather boots 
completed the costume of this dashing gentleman 

 how do curnel fine day wobbled the major lounging to the side of 
the millionaire cussed dull town this is not a man shot down in the 
streets to day i vow 

 your humble servant major may i request your services in an affair 
of great delicacy i have an enemy he has resorted to mean practices 
to injure me i have determined to put him down in order to do this 
must visit one of the vilest dens in the quaker city i want a friend to go 
with me stand by me and fight for me will you be that friend 

 where is the den of thieves drawled mulhill with a sleepy look 

 did you ever hear of monk-hall 

there s my paw said the classic mulhill but mind ye if there 

ain t a man killed i shall account the affair low d d low 

thanks major thanks exclaimed fitz-cowles taking the pioffered 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

hand meet me an hour from this time at the cornor of fifth and cheat 
nut streets till then good bye 

 da-day drawled mulhill i will not fail you a-doo 

and fitz-cowles hurried up the street with a frown on his brow while 
mulhill lounged in an opposite direction with a broad grin on his red visage 
fitz-cowles placed his gold-headed cane to his lips and muttered wildly to 
himself while mulhill drew from his pocket a slip of paper and rattled it 
against the tip of his nose with a broad grin 

 a love letter from a g-a- he muttered and then went laughing on 
his way 

and at the same instant like a ghost walking forth in the noonday sun 
from the house of ravoni the form of devil-bug emerged into the light 

 monk-hall he shouted with a hideous grin and rushed wildly down 
the street 

ravoni bore the maiden into the western chamber and laid her uncon 
scious form on the velvet -cushions of the arm chair beside the table then 
stepping backward he contemplated her face with folded arms and a di 
lating eye her long dark hair fell in one thick mass around her pale 
countenance and the long fringes of her eye-lashes rested upon the white 
ness of her snowy cheeks there was a sweet smile lingering on her lips 
a silent thought a calmness and a love speaking from her pallid brow 

ravoni stood gazing upon her and even through the sallow paint which 
marred the eternal manhood of his visage you might see the warm blood 
glowing and brightening with deep emotion his dark red lip grew eloquent 
with feeling something full of passion and yet holier than sensual love 

 thou art very beautiful murmured ravoni speaking in that low toned 
voice which flowed like music on the air and thou shalt be the priestess 
of the new faith 

leaning gently forward he impressed a kiss upon her brow too warm 
for a father s kiss too holy for a lover s 

the maiden unclosed her eyes and murmured in a low whisper two half- 
audible words my father 

 girl thou hast no father it is all a trick a delusion a show the 
poor wretch who forged the note which lured thee to this mansion tore 
thee from the arms of father and mother when but a babe thy parents 
are long since dead and thou art an orphan 

there was something so calm and so assured in the tones of ravoni that 
the hopes of mabel broke away from her soul like the crumbling sands be 
fore the waves of ocean her world was gone and yet the utter deso- 
ation of her agony was too deep for tears her dark eyes flashed and di- 
lated and yet their glance never wandered from the eyes of ravoni 
 thou art an orphan he repeated taking her white hand within his 
own ana looking trough her eyes into her soul in this goodlv chris 



ravoni and mabel 

tian world thou hast had never a friend thy life has been made the sport 
and plaything of a hypocrite who would have visited thy soul with an 
eternal stain tell me fair girl what are the ties that bind thee to life 

 orphan muttered mabel in an absent tone 

 yes orphan another name for youth helplessness and misery 
orphan a thing to be trodden upon by the oppressors of this world to 
be trampled by godly feet crushed by pious hands look upon me far 
girl gaze in mine eyes and mark my words in this great world whera 
thou art friendless and alone will be thy friend 

 you murmured mabel and will you not too deceive and betray 

deceive a soul like thine exclaimed ravoni with a bitter smile 
 leave that to priests and worldlings could deceive thee 

he leaned gently forward and his dark eyes shone into her soul with 
parted lips and gasping breath mabel gazed upon him and murmured 
 never never there was an irresistible power in his look his tone 
and speaking brow she felt drawn to him and yet it was not with pas 
sion it seemed to her that she could lay forever at his feet and listen to 
the wild music of his tone without a word or motion in reply 

was the sorcerer subduing her will with the wierd magnetism of his 
spirit in other words was the man of deep and powerful intellect silent 
ly overshadowing her soul with his irresistible will why does the 
maiden pure and stainless as god s angels hang on his look and tone with 
that fascination which seems more like a deep religious reverence than an 
earthly love 

 it is from such as thee fair girl that the great father chooses his 
rarest jewels unto such as thee are unlocked the mysteries of the world 
the sun the sky the air and of that most wonderful of all creations the 
human soul thou art an orphan yet shalt thou breathe in a world un 
known to grosser souls thine unsealed eyes shall gaze upon sights that 
shall fill the blood with rapture that shall make the heart undulate on waves 
of music like some angel barque freighted with perfume as it glides in light 
and song over gently-rippling waters thou art an orphan and yet in 
thought and soul thon shalt be as one of the seraphim who live in the sun- 
shine of the father s presence 

no word from mabel s lips not even a sigh already the words of the 
sorcerer were bursting into fulfilment while her wrapt eye grew glassy 
with fascination while the tones of ravoni fell on her ear with the musical 
murmur of green leaves dipping gently into rippling waves a strange pan 
orama of beauty glided on her soul 

first a soft and mellow light then a cool lake environed by green hills 
then from a mountain s summit she gazed upon a gorgeous sweep of forests 
broken by vinyards and cities with streams of blue water winding along 
grassy plains where marble palaces arose upon the summer air then she 
trod the streets of air ancient city where strange costumes and swf rthy faces 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

flitted by while immortality looked down from long lines of massive tern 
pies sublime with the triumphs of an architecture which was reared in the 
sweat and blood of millions thro the long lapse of ages 

then strains of music whose melody never stirred the chords of a harp 
touched by human hands filled her soul and from the bowers of a green 
isle she gazed upon the calm expanse of ocean with white clouds uprising 
from the waters into the sunny sky 

 would st thou behold the face of thy mother the calm tones of ra- 
voni broke on the ear of the maiden and like a flash her dream or vision 
call it what you will was past and vanished 

she awoke to the consciousness of ravoni s look and tone and brow 
 my mother she exclaimed in tremulous tones oh let me look upon 
her 

 advance to yonder mirror let the whole force of thy soul be cen 
tred upon thy mother whom thou hast never beheld with the eyes of sense 
advance and gaze and thine own mother shall stand before thee 

trembling through every fibre of her young form mabel arose the 
mirror reached half-way from the floor to the ceiling in an interval of the 
crimson hangings it was but five steps forward and yet mabel seemed an 
age in passing that trifling space trembling and pale she stood before 
the mirror afraid to gaze within its glittering frame 

 look within the mirror exclaimed ravoni what dost thou behold 

 i see my own form and i see yours whispered mabel 

ravoni bent his eyes to the floor and pressed his hand on his forehead 

 my will shall pass into her brain he murmured what dost thou 
see now 

 there are faint outlines as of a woman s form slowly whispered ma 
bel there is the gleam of two dark eyes but all beside is mist and shadow 

 thy soul is not yet firm think of thy mother think earnestly and 
with thy entire soul and lo she will stand before thee 

there was silence for a moment the sorcerer sate by the table with 
his hand pressed against his brow while mabel stood before the mirror he 
dark eyes burning with an unnatural light 

joy joy faintly murmured mabel she comes 

and like a beam of light from the bosom of a cloud the vision stood before 
her the form of a woman clad in light robes with two dark eyes of un 
utterable beauty beaming from a pale face around whose outlines fell thick 
tresses of raven hair it was there for a moment there within the mirror 
and then it was gone 

 my mother i have seen thee muttered mabel and fell fainting into 
the arms of ravoni 

her head rested upon his shoulder and her dark hair fell waving over his 
arms and hands 

 the-e are those who search the ocean for its secrets the air for its mys-

chapter eighth 

the death op the white owl 

an old man leaning upon spade stood on the brow of a gentle eminence 
with the beams of the setting sun falling over his wrinkled face 

he stood in front opi massive gate whose posts falling to decay were in 
strong contrast with the solidity of a thick stone wall which extended along 
the eminence until it was lost to view in the hollows on either side 

behind the wall arose a thick grove of pines with the steep roofs and grey 
walls of an old-time mansion dimly visible through their evergreen boughs 

in front of the aged mzn lay a wild and broken tract of country plains 
of dreary sand varied by sombre forests of pine or here and there an orchard 
of peach trees with the bare and desolate limbs waving stiffly in the winter 
air or a solitary farm-house rising from some bleak waste of brown earth 
the distant western horizon was one dim and dreary wall of pine forest with 
the broad disc of the setting sun seen half above the dark barrier while his 
level beams fell with a red lustre over the wintry landscape 

the whole tract of country in view of the old man who stood on the 
brow of the eminence wild and dreary as it was in summer was now ren 
deied fearful as some night-mare dream by the absence of the scanty foliage 
which served to hide some of its most hideous features 

the setting sun-light streamed over the sides of steep ravines sunken in 
the bosom of the sand wastes like colossal graves or along the surface of 
black pools of water visible through the intervals of pine forests or over thf 
side of some barren hill which shot up suddenly from the surrounding plain 
with its bleak sides covered with the trunks of burnt and blasted trees 






 ravoni the sorcerer 

the eye of the old man was fixed upon the road which made one straight 
track through the landscape from the distant horrizon urtil it terminated a 
the gate of the mansion frequently crossed by streams of water or again 
rising into slight eminences this road was all one dreary path of sand a 
sight more barren can scarcely be conceived 

within the compass of a mile from the spot where the old man stood arose 
three gentle hills and on the summit of each of these his eye was rivetted 
with peculiar interest 

on the nearest hill a carriage was visible drawn by two noble bay horses 
whose harness glittered in the sun 

on the next hill like some enormous beetle creeping forth from its haunts 
ere the day was done a black and gloomy hearse came rapidly onward 

on the last hill the form of a horseman bestriding a gallant grey steed 
rose up between the eyes and the setting sun 

 man and boy for sixty long years i ve lived on this old place and yet 
i never see d sich a sight as that afore for the last half hour i ve watched 
em and still they come on the carriage fust the hearse next and the horse 
man last an they will drive at the same pace the hearse keeps little over 
a quarter-a-mile from the carriage and the horseman keeps the same dis 
tance from the hearse well well if it ain t the queerest sight and reether 
the solemn est i ll never strike spade into airth agin 

as the old man muttered this rude soliloquy an aged woman clad in a 
petticoat of coarse linsey hobbled through the gate and took her place at 
his side her grey eyes dilating with wonder as she gazed upon the road 
beneath 

meanwhile the carriage the hearse and the horse came hurriedly onward 

we will descend for a moment from our eminence at the mansion gate 
and take a glance at carriage hearse and horse 

in one corner of the thickly cushioned carriage sate a proud and peerless 
woman whose tall form enveloped in a green riding habit was also muffled 
in the warm folds of a dark cloth cloak her hands were folded across her 
bosom and her face drooped down until her chin rested on her fingers 
there was a volume of thought in her full dark eye and a strange meaning 
in the steady frown which indented her queenly brow 

 to give up all a coronet and a title for virtue and livingstone the 
thought is galling and yet i have given my oath and it shall be 

as these thoughts flashed over the soul of dora livingstone she leaned 
slightly forward and looked through the opened carriage window 

 how strange a journey of only thirty miles and yet it has consumed 
the entire day first the carriage breaks down it takes the servants at 
least three hours to repair the accident then at noon i am overtaken by 
albert he tells me that the doctor has forbidden him to ride in a close car 
riage so he will follow me on horseback then with one delay after another 
are are detained on the road and now as the night is coming on we approach 



the death of the white owl 

fhe old domain of hawkewood how singular that hearse has followed 
my carriage since noon-day i know its all superstition but still i cannot 
repress a shudder whenever my eye chances to fall upon that gloomy vehi 
cle yes yes and her thoughts resumed their original channel i have 
given rny oath and it shall be 

as she fell back on her seat her soul became engaged again in the fearful 
contest which had convulsed it during the entire day virtue and living 
stone or a coronet and murder 

meanwhile along the brow of the next hill the hearse drawn by a dark 
horse half concealed in sable trappings came gloomily onward the driver 
a man of some forty years with a phlegmatic countenance sate on the box 
smoking a cigar the dark velvet hangings of the hearse wafting slowly 
aside disclosed the coffin it was covered with rich black cloth and the 
sun-beams glistened on the silver plate inscribed with name and age of the 
deceased 

the driver tossed the thick weepers aside from his face and cracked his 
whip and puffed his cigar and the hearse rolled rapidly down the hill a 
sharp stone projecting from the road-side struck against one of the wheels 
and well nigh overturned the hearse in the road 

the driver stopped the horse jumped from his seat i must see if that 
ere mortality box ai nt damaged a little he exclaimed and approached the 
side of the hearse the coffin was slightly moved and leaning within the 
hearse the driver proceeded to arrange it in its former position while thus 
occupied he read the inscription on the silver plate of the coffin thus it 
ran 

dora ltttngtonr 

died dec j 

aged years months and one dat 

 couzin o his muttered the phlegmatic driver pointing to the distant 
horseman ha-hum died this morning fore daybreak he was in a hurry 
to get the plate made queer howsomdever all i ve got to do is to 
drive out to yander old place put -the coffin in an out-house without bein 
seen in order to spare the feelin s of relatives and then drive back to town 
agin spect the young lady made a felo see of herself 

with this soliloquy the driver jumped on the box puffed his cigar and 
with a crack of his whip the hearse rolled down the hill 

the noble figure of the horseman and the form of the gallant grey steed 
which he rode rose up in the light of the sun from the summit of the 
last hill 

pausing for a moment on the brow of the hill the horseman bared his 
brow to the setting sun the thick corded veins stood out from the bronzed 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

skin and the blue eye deep sunken beneath the dark eyebrow glared with 
an unsteady and wandering light for a single moment as the light or rl ie 
sun shone over that face and brow it presented a sight of fearful interest 

for a single moment the muscles of the face the veins of the forehead 
the livid lips worked and writhed like crawling lizards the blue eye so 
strangely contrasted with the dark eyebrow dilated until the pupil absorbed 
nearly the entire surface of the eyeball it was but for a moment and then 
ail was calm again but it was a calmness like sunset over the black waters 
of the dead sea 

a deep husky sound like the mingling of a death rattle with cheerful 
laughter shook the broad chest of the merchant and then with a set smile 
on his lips he gave the rein to his steed and dashed along the road 

he had not gone ten paces when another horseman dressed in plain 
black riding a brown horse all whitened with foam attained the summit of 
the hill and shouted to livingstone at the top of his voice 

u hello you sir hello he cried can you tell me which is the way to 
hawkewood 

turning his head over his shoulder livingstone gazed upon the stranger 

 yonder building among the trees is the place you seek he calmly 
answered 

 dev lish glad to hear it exclaimed the stranger who was a man of 
some thirty years with a face of no particular meaning never in all my 
born days have i had sich a ride as to day you see sir i landed at new- 
york yesterday from the steamship and came post haste to philadelphia 
where i found that i d have to ride a matter o thirty miles before i could 
bee the genelman i was seekin after could vt tell me sir whether i d 
be sure to find mr livingstone at that old place yonder 

 my name is livingstone cooly responded the merchant 

the stranger gave a start which he communicated to his horse by a 
violent twitch at the reins 

 what albert livingstone esq philadelphia pennsylvania nited state 
o merica he shouted in a voice of unlimited astonishment 

 the same sir replied the merchant 

 well sir i m a clerk of your father s lawyers messrs billings smith 
 charmley london i m a special messenger sir sent over to see you 
there s the package sir that is to say my lord 

the excited special messenger had thrown himself from his horse and 
hat in hand approached the stirrups of the merchant holding a large pac- 
quet in his hand sealed with enormous red seals 

 i guess its purport said livingstone with a slight smile he took the 
pacquet placed it within the breast of his overcoat and then drew forth his 
docket-book here is something for your trouble he exclaimed hand- 
 rag the special messenger a roll of notes 

then putting spurs to his steed he rode forward leaving the gentleman 



 the death of the white owl 

standing ii the centre of the road a very well executed statue of blank 
astonishment with its hand crammed full of paper money 

in a few minutes livingstone dashed by the hearse arid speeding rapidly 
forward he reached the eminence in front of the mansion gate at the same 
moment that his wife stepped from the carriage dismounting from his 
rteed the merchant received the salutations of the servants 

 welkim to hawkewood mister livingstone welkim to hawkewood 
ma am exclaimed the old gardener and his wife as they hobbled forward 

mrs livingstone greeted the old people with a cordial bow while the 
merchant took them each by the hand and spoke cheerfully of the good 
old times when his father was living and he roamed the deep woods an 
idle and free-hearted boy 

livingstone now approached his wife she stood erect in the centre of 
the knoll with every outline of her magnificent form displayed to advan 
tage by the green riding habit which she wore 

 you have had a weary ride my love said livingstone in a kind tone 
as he laid his hand upon her shoulder and gazed in her beautiful face 

 such vexatious delays she answered with a smile but do tell me 
albert where is that hearse going that i now see ascending the road it 
has followed the carriage the entire afternoon 

 i had some conversation with the driver as i came along it appears 
that a poor girl of good family died suddenly in a village some ten miles 
beyond hawkewood this man is taking the coffin for her funeral and 
will stop here for a few minutes to refresh his horse he made the request 
of me dora when i told him that i was the owner of this place and you 
know he added with a playful smile i couktn t refuse the poor fel 
low and his horse are so tired 

as he spoke the hearse came up the hill and while the driver sat calmly 
smoking his cigar it passed throngh the gate and rolled away toward the 
outhouses of the mansion 

dora uttered an involuntary shriek 

 oh the coffin she murmured and turned her head away 

 it certainly looks very solemn said livingstone calmly and then 
the plate on the top reflects the last rays of the sun like a mirror 

while the merchant s horse the carriage and the hearse were led or 
driven toward the outbuildings of the mansion livingstone and his wife 
stood on the summit of the knoll gazing in silence upon the setting sun 
the aged man and woman like statues of extreme old age leaned against 
the crumbling gate posts and gazed steadily upon the beautiful form of the 
merchant s wife 

 wot a han some couple muttered the old woman but then it s so 
onlucky that that ere hearse followed the carriage 

the beams of the setting sun streamed over the proud form of the mer 
chant and over the figure of his beautiful wife behind them lay the thick 
 



 ravoni the sorcerer 

grove of pines with the massive outlines of the old mansion seen through 
the darkening boughs in front of them swept the wild track of broken coun 
try now blending into one mass of darkness under the gathering gloom of 
twilight while far away the last glimpse of the sun was stealing over the 
thick horizon of pine forests 

dora gazed upon the scene and felt a strange feeling of awe steal over 
her soul turning to livingstone she began an observation on the thought 
ful quietude of the hour but it died half-uttered on her lips 

 it is a solemn sun-set albert she whispered when she caught the 
gleam of his calm blue eye there was something so unnatural so fearful 
in the expression that flashed from the eyes of livingstone that dora felt 
a thrill of horror dart through every vein 

 it is indeed a solemn sunset answered livingstone in a calm and even 
tone but the morning will be bright dora bright my love he turned 
his head aside to conceal a frightful grimace that distorted his face 

the whirring of wings was heard in the air over-head livingstone and 
his wife looked toward the zenith in momentary curiosity 

 it s the old white owl exclaimed davidson the gardener you know 
mr livingstone the white owl that was old when you was a boy 

 ah yes i remember davidson began the merchant but his words 
were interrupted by a whizzing noise in the air followed by a dull sound 
near his feet 

the bird an enormous white owl lay dead on the earth between himself 
and his wife without a shot or blow or wound from a clear sky it had 
fallen dead it lay with its wings out-spread and its dying eye covered with 
a glassy film 

 how strange muttered dora with an attempt to smile i hope it is 
no evil omen 

 come my dear interrupted livingstone without bestowing a glance 
upon the dead bird the evening is cold let us walk toward the mansion 

she took his arm and soon their figures were seen in the intervals of the 
pine trees through the dimness of the twilight 

old davidson advanced along the road and gazed upon the dead owl 
his wrinkled cheek was pale as ashes his aged dame stood by his side with 
quivering limbs and chattering teeth 

omen muttered the old gardener in an absent tone omen 

 why yes don t ye ricoleck screeched the old woman that old 
livingstone always took sich keer o that owl he always feared the 
prophesy that had been made some time or other about it he always sed 
that when the old white owl of hawkewood died one of the livingstones 
ud meet with a sudden death an there it lays dead as a stone 

 stuff muttered the old man and yet he stood surveying the dead owl 
with a look of unmingled fear since you do rake up sich foolish tales 
why don t yo tell em right old livingstone always charged me to take 



the death of the white owl 

good keer o the white owl s life for when that bird dies ses he one of 
the livingstones will murder his best friend or the wife of his bosom 

as though conscious of the words uttered by the old man the dead owl 
faintly fluttered its wings for a single moment it was only the winter wind 
passing through the snowy feathers 

livingstone and his wife stood in the doorway of the old-time mansion 
around them lay thick shadows of twilight and through a long avenue of 
pines extending in gloomy perspective from the hall door toward the west 
they beheld the last glimpse of the expiring winter s day 

 here my father made his home exclaimed livingstone turning to hugt 
wife as they stood on the threshold of the place here escaping from the 
cares of city life he delighted to bury himself in the shadows of the dim old 
halls where the first man of our race who trod the american shores had 
lived and ruled in the state of an old english baron 

 your family were noble in the old world asked dora gazing upon 
the sombre countenance of her husband now half-veiled by the shadows of 
twilight 

 aye noble by the lineage of a thousand years broad lands and stout 

throngs of retainers owned their sway when a bitter smile broke over 

his lips a woman brought dishonor and murder to our house under 

an assumed name the last lord of the race sought the american shores 
leaving his lands in the old world to distant kinsmen he reared this man 
sion and lived and died within its walls it is a long story dora and a 
dark one and when i think of my father s soul clouded by the cankering 
memory of a nameless wrong i begin to think that a hereditary taint of su 
perstition lingers in our blood 

 superstition echoed dora 

 was not my father superstitious from brooding over the crime which 
had dishonored our house he came to walk in a world of his own where 
every object was darkened by the memory of our traditional wrong you d 
hardly believe it dora but my father indulged and cherished a wild belief 
approaching in certain respects the old doctrine of the transmigration of 
souls 

a muttered exclamation of surprise escaped from dora as she beheld 
livingstone s noble countenance fire with an expression of singular enthu 
siasm 

 through the treachery of a woman ha ha the treachery of a woman 
mark ye the pride of our house was levelled to the dust a wrong terrible 
as it is nameless was done to the dearest friend of my lordly ancestor my 
father either from some wild tradition which had descended to him with the 
memory of that wrong or from his peculiar habits of thought believed firmly 
that the spirit of this much wronged friend hovered around our house foi 
its evil and its ruin the white owl which fell dead at our feet to m crht 



 ravoni the sorcerer 



y- enshrouded that spirit in its bosom ha ha such was my father s super 
stition for more than an hundred years that owl has hovered around 
the roofs of hawkewood my father believed that within twelve hours after 
its death some awful calamity would befall our house 

 a singular superstition exclaimed dora who took a strange interest 
in the words of her husband did the belief of your father specify the 
nature of the calamity 

 what a pitiable thing is human nature said livingstone with a bitter 
smile to think that a man like my father should be the victim of such 
a puerile superstition will you credit me dora when i tell you the na 
ture of the calamity which the death of this doom-bird was to bring to our 
house ha ha the absurdity of the thing makes me smile 

the calamity 

 was this when the white owl of hawkewood dies then shall a 
livingstone crimson his hands in the blood of his wife or receive his death 
i through her guilt and shame such is the prophecy how absurd 

 and in this prophecy your father held implicit faith asked dora with 
a pale cheek and dilating eye 

 the night grows cold my love said livingstone with a manner of 
affectionate regard let us enter the mansion yes yes my father was 
tinctured with this ridiculous superstition but the greatest men have had 
similar follies csesar had his phantom napoleon his star and ha ha the 
heir of hawkewood must have his spirit disguised as an owl 

and as he crossed the threshold with a careless laugh the gloomy hearse 
rolled past the hall door toward the gate of the mansion its uplifted drapery 
disclosing the vacant space no longer occupied by the coffin concealed in 
black cloth with a glittering plate on its bosom 



book the fiftr 
the third night 

the death-angels 

it is night again and we are once more in the quaker city it is the thivj 
night of our history and from the bosom of the darkness which like a bird of omew 
broods over the city forms of mist and shadow arise they raise their hands to the 
heavens they glide along with looks of unutterable woe do you hear the mourn 
ful music floating on the air do you see the awful frown darkening over the 
faces of these death- angels for they are death- angels sent forth to dip their 
raven wings in blood it is night now but ere the morrow breaks these minis 
ters of wrath will lay down before the throne of fate the souls of the slain 

one angel glides solemnly over the city folding his awful wings above the 
house of ravoni 

another death-spirit spreads his wings over the broad delaware and points to 
the far sand plains where a light like a world on fire rushes into the dark sky 

one spirit of doom watches over the city and the sorcerer s house and the 
other spreads his wings for the wild forest the old-time mansion and the plain of 
sand 

again that wild music on the air 

srhe death-angels are muttering with impatience they hunger for the blood 
which shall drip from their wings ere the morrow s dawn 



chapter first 

the outcasts of the quaker city 

c 

the dead-vault of monk-hall was illumined by the glare of lights in 
the centre of the square space described by four massive brick pillars stood 
a large table of unpainted pine with some- dozen candles arranged along its 
surface burning in candlesticks of rusted iron gusts of wind moaning 
from the dim vault flung the light with a flaring lustre over the massy out 
lines of the pillars revealing the fragments of coffins scattered round the 
floor mingled with human bones or sending a wild uncertain ray into the 
far recesses of the cellar where dismal nooks yawned like graves or the 

 



 the death-angels 

substantial masonry of the place assumed a thousand strange and fantastic 
forms 

beside the table with one huge hand resting on its boards stood the 
door-keeper of monk-hall his head half drooped upon his broad chest and 
nis solitary eye glaring down upon the oaken floor now and then the 
wind tossed his tangled hair aside from his protuberant brow and a single 
vein shooting up between the eyebrows was revealed as it stood out from 
the skin like a thick cord or the light flared over his distorted features 
giving their harsh outlines a momentary and horrid glare 

 devil-bug he muttered in his hoarse grating voice yes that s 
my name the gal s tuk for my arms and i ll live to gather the good red 

goold devil-bug ill be a rich man afore long to think that jew 

should have been hid so snug a night an a day in the tower room did nt 
i pump him he offer d to sheer the chest of gold and the papers if i d 
help him to escape to furrin parts ha h-a bess hid him there did she 
and the old oman s will is in the chest what a cussed fool i was to 
murder the widder for her goold when by her will she gives it all the child 
of her ellen and marchant livingstone should sed child ever be found 
and that child is now in the hands of the wizard ugh 

devil -bug clasped his talon fingers together and uttered a low groan 
how the heart of the monster clung to the child of ellen 

 the jew must be done fust of all then the goold is mine 

a roar of wild laughter from an adjoining cellar drowned the whispers 
of the door-keeper 

 it s them he cried with a wild grin the dogs the cut-throats 
the thieves ho-hoo the jew belongs to their band 

again his words were lost in a wild burst of laughter and the rudo 
strains of the vagabond s song broke on the air chanted by hoarse voice 
to a quick cantering measure 

the vagabond s song 

 a jolly band of good fellows all 
 are the outcast monks of old monk-hall 
they dance they steal they drink they fight 

and turn the shiny day into night 

 

 chorus boys s shouted a hoarse voice 

 raw mon gahaley is the g-o 
clink you re mugs with a jolly sound 
down in the vaults below bel-ow 
down in the vaults below the ground 
hurrah for the brave lads one and all 
the outcast monks of old monk-hall 

hur-rah 



the outcasts of the quaker city 

 that s the stuff exclaimed devil-bug approaching the massy door 
of the thieves cellar which fashioned of stout wood and strengthened by 
bands of iron was dimly perceptible in the light at the distance of some 
twenty paces from the table 

 come out o this he shouted pulling at the bolt of the door come 
out yo thieves yo robbers yo devils 

the door flew open and the blaze of a warm hearth streamed into the 
dead-vault devil-bug s amiable greeting was answered by the thunder 
shout of some twenty or thirty voices 

 hurrah for the brave lads one and all 
the outcast monks of old monk-hall 

and through the opened door into the dead-vault there poured one 
breathing mass of rags and lameness filth and crime 

some forty or fifty vagabonds men who had grown old in crime women 
whose bloated visages belied their sex and and puny children whose dis 
torted faces were stamped with cunning came tramping through the door 
and surrounded the form of devil-bug who in the midst of that motley 
crowd looked like a devil among his attendant imps 

these were the outcasts of the quaker city in the day-time vagabond 
man and woman and child lay quiet and snug in the underground recesses 
of monk-hall in the night they stole forth from the secret passage thro 
the pawnbroker s shop in the adjoining street and prowled over the city tc 
beg to rob or perchance to murder 

bleared eyes distorted faces shrunken limbs these all were there on 
every side was filth and rags the rags indeed were a wonder had 
the heavens on some stormy day rained rags and our friends the vaga 
bonds been caught in the shower they could not have been better furnished oy 
with tatters than they were now the childrens faces peeped out from a 
wilderness of rags the shrunken limbs or the stout forms of the men were 
muffled in rags thick as the scales or a fish and the bloated countenances 
of the women were framed in tatters there was not one whole garment 
in the entire crowd here was a stout burly ruffian with the remnant of 
a white over-coat appended to the sad remains of a pair of checked trowsers 
there stood an unshaven loafer in a blue roundabout with one tattered 
sleeve and then came a throng of women clad in modified remnants of 
petticoat night-gown and frock ragged as an election banner after a 
patriotic fight 

and among this haggard crowd were women who twenty years ago had 
been belles in the saloons of fashion men who had been educated by rich 
and aristocratic fathers for lawyers judges bishops and governors jui 
the mass had been born in misery baptized by starvation and confirmed 
it the altar of poverty by the good old bishop crimeh 



 the death-angels 

here they stood the heathens and outcasts of the chi istian quaker city 
rotting in misery and sin while bibles sent by goodly missionary societies 
were on their way to degraded hindoostan here they stood steeped to the 
lips in vice while pious preachers were hurrying over land and ocean in or- 
der to save the souls of naked savages of the south sea or rescue freezing 
greenlanders of the polar waste from the perils of eternal death 

 hurray for old devil-bug the shout broke from the assembled band 
of vagabonds 

 hush your d d noise growled devil-bug or shall i lame two 

or three of you anybody here that would like a leg broke or a head 
smash d 

 silence genelmen roared a loafer who gloried in the name of rusty 
jake the perprieter o this establishment has the floor 

and with a solemn bow the ruffian arranged the solitary sleeve of his 
roundabout 

 silence silence chorussed the vagabonds 

let the wimmen and childr n re-tire observed devil-bug with quiet 
gravity the bloated females and the precocious children obeyed the mo 
tion of devil-bug s hand in silence they trooped through the door into 
the next cellar the doorkeeper stood alone with some thirty ruffians 
whose visages would have effectively adorned the windows of a goal they 
all wore the same coarse unshaven desperate look 

 wot i wants to know is this resumed devil-bug have i been a 
father to ye ye ugly devils 

 has he been a father to us echoed rusty jake turning to his com 
rades with a leer of astonishment he axes that ere questi n oh my 
has n t he been a reglar daddy to us boys 

hurray for old devil -bug shouted the thieves cut-throats and 
vagabonds devil-bug hammered his fist on the table

had plenty of grub to eat have i treated you to the best monygahaley 
i puts the quest in to you have n t i treated you like genelmen 

 like lords cried rusty jake 

 like fightin cocks exclaimed a thin-visaged loafer known as 
slippery elm 

 like pigs in swill was the classic remark of another vagabond who 
wore the upper portion of a great coat or like a bank d rector treats the 
fudges o th court wot try s him and pump-handle as the ruffian was 
styled flung up his hat in very glee 

 hurrah for old devil-bug chorussed the mass of vagabonds 

 in this scene the author omits the various allusions in the slang peculiar to the va 
gabond tribes of the quaker city they have a language of their own but its repetition 
m these pages would afford no interest to the general reader 



the outcasts of the quaker city 

 genelmen i wants to per-pound you a quest in wot should be done 
with the feller who arter all my care and trouble for his sake and for youi 
gineral welfare goes and blows us to the poleese 

as devil-bug uttered these words in a tone of quiet gravity he presented 
in his person and manner a capital burlesque of some godlike senator 
while the vagabonds grouped around him looked like congressmen eager 
to pay their attentions to judge lynch 

one wild burst of execration arose form the band 

 to the d with him we ll cut his throat 

 genelmen resumed devil-bug this ere jew gabr el von gelt is 
sich a man what shall be done with him 

 gabr el von gelt muttered rusty jake striking an attitude i 
never thought much o that feller why he was above drinkin ivjonyga- 
haley whiskey 

 and he wouldvt eat pork 

and he was too proud to go ragged 

there was a great excitement the ruffians murmured together and 
their rude hands drew forth knives and pistols from the thick concealment 
of their rags 

 what shall be done with him was the quiet demand of devil-bug 

the answer of rusty jake was terse and pointed 

 its my opinion vich i entertains in common these genelmen that this 
ere jew s wizand ought to be examined 

he passed his hand across his throat in a gesture at once graceful and 
expressive 

 cut his throat was the response of the outcasts 

 hark there s his footstep on the stairs exclaimed devil-bug 
 he s comin down a word with yo fellers i must go up stairs amin- 
nit don t do anything with the jew till i get back i ll bring you some 
rare monygahaley i must get em drunk afore they murder the jew he 
muttered nothin like rum to sharpen a cut-throat s knife 

as he disappeared in the direction of the western door of the vault the 
sound of footsteps grew louder in the opposite direction 

 its the jew muttered rusty jake and as he spoke a murmur of sur 
prise ran thro the ruffian band a tall figure clad from head to foot in 
rags stepped from the shadow of a brick pillar and advanced toward the 
table his hair and whiskers made him resemble a walking conflagration 
they were thick bushy and burning red his skin was hideously freckled 
and from beneath his red eyebrows flashed the glance of two snake- like 
eyes giving his face a strange and wild expression 

 hello comrades growled rusty jake who s this feller 
 vy you see said the stranger with a genuine vagabond snuffle i m 
a feller bein in distress the poleese is arter me i wants you to hide 
me old boy cover me up snug will you 



 the death-angels 

a murmur of suspicion ran thro the band 
 the watch- word if you please stranger asked rusty jake 
 o course calmly responded the red-haired vagabond pork and 
beans is a werry good dinner specially with molasses my name is 
brick-top gemmen my daddy was a scavenger and my mammy 

scld rags 

the outcasts looked upon him in suspicious wonder and then huddling 
in a group murmured together 

 i must obtain the papers from the jew or die was the whispered re 
mark of brick-top as he stood beside the table for a night and a day 
i have lain half-bruized to death in my room up stairs but a few mo 
ments ago disguised in these old rags i escaped from the front door of 
monk-hall passed thro the pawnbroker s shop and here i am in the pow 
er of a band of reckless cut-throats i must watch the course of events

hiding place and obtain the papers or forfeit my life

tery accumulates on mystery the girl is livingstone s child i must save 
her from ruin

 robbin a market wagon answered brick-top in a surly tone 
 oh you werry contemptible individual exclaimed rtrsty jake rob

brick-top squared his elbows and looked around with a threatening scowl 
 what the d i you growlin at i ve murdered my man in my time 
been convicted sentenced for it too i m no new hand at the bellows i 
tell you 

 that s somethin like exclaimed slippery elm good capital 
echoed the band

a precious fool to axe me sich a question why the governor pardoned 
me of course 



the outcasts of the quaker city 

 why so he did me cried rusty jake 

 and so he did me exclaimed slippery elm 

 and me shouted pump-handle 

 and me cried another ruffian 

 and me by hokey added an unshaven vagabond 

 hurrah for the pardenin power chorussed the rest of the band 

it was now brick-top s turn to ask questions 

 what were you tried for he exclaimed turning to rusty jake 

 i had a misfortin responded the worthy i killed a man by accident 
you see it was on the highway at night i axed him a civil question ho 
replied with impudence we had words his wizand was perforated

him for his purse or his life he would nt give the fust so i tuk the last 
 but he added with a grin i found mercy i was pardoned

we got up a nigger riot we have them things in phil delphy once or twice 
a year you know i helped to burn a nigger church two orphans asy 
lums and a school-house and happenin to have a pump-handle in my 
hand i aksedentally hit an old nigger on the head konsekance wos he

 and you was tried for this little accident 

 yes i was convicted too sentenced in the bargain but the 
judge and the jury and the lawyers on both sides signed a paper to the 
governor he pardoned me but i could nt keep my hands in the ways 
o virtue so here i am agin hidin from the poleese 

rusty jake looked around with an expression of deep thought 

 i say fellers why could nt we have a governor that ud weto the poleese 

 hurray for a governor that ud weto the poleese and the judges and 
the courts slippery elm sprang from his feet with excitement as he 
uttered this remarkable sentiment 

rusty jake had been a small politician in his time two years past he 
had been an influential party man on a limited scale in procuring forged 
naturalization papers for verdant foreigners or in swearing native paupers 
and thieves into the inestimable knowledge of voting he was alike efficient 
and skillful 

rusty jake had also been a speech-maker he had stirred up the patrio 
tism of the people with the cry of down with the bank or up with the 
bank as the humor seized him or as he was paid for his services by more 
magnificent politicians rusty jake therefore had grown into the habit of 
speech-making he could not let the present opportunity pass witho jt a few 
mioroving remarks 



 the death-angels 

genelmen feller citizens freemen he shouted ascending he table and 
gazing upon the assembled crowd of ruffians 

 wot was it that our forefather s fit bled and died for wot did they 
go in the cold for without a mint-julip to make em jolly or a sherry cobbler 
to warm their insides was it to have this item o human rights wiped off 
the slate o liberty with the sponge tyranny was it to have the parde- 
nin power struck out o th constitooshun the idee is redikulus why 

the fact is tho it ain t ginerally known that the whole revolution was 

on account of the pardenin power gineral washington as history will 
tell you was put in jail for killin an injin in a nigger riot down south 
that old curmudgeon george the third refused to pardon gineral wash 
ington the revolution gentlemen wos the konsekence o that refusal i 
refers you to history gentlemen for further pertik lers 

 genelmen feller citizens shouted slippery elm three cheers for 
the governor wot pardons everybody for doin everything and don t axe 
no quest ins huzzay 

the loud hurrah of the vagabonds was interrupted by the footstep and 
voice of devil -bug who now appeared from the shadow of a brick pillar 
holding a large earthen jug in his hand 

 will you hush that cussed noise he thundered in his growling voice 
 here s the monygahaley boys pass it round d ye know fellers that 
von gelt is comin down staks hello brick-top here 

he started as he perceived the form of his pretended accomplice 

 you see the poleese is arter me began luke 

 h-u-s-h these fellers must n t know nothin muttered devil-bug 
 that jew von gelt has been betrayin us he must die you must 
help dispatch him and i he muttered this sentence to himself will see 
to you and so git rid of both my partners the jew must die he cried 
turning to the vagabond crew 

 how asked slippery elm 

you see this square table it stands upon a trap let the jew set 
down on a bench at this side and let one of our fellers set down on a bench 
opposite s pose he begins to talk to the jew and gits him drinkm a 
single kick from the man s foot will strike this knob sink the trap and 
send our pork-hater to the devil d ye see it boys 

rusty jake and the other vagabonds examined the knob which arose 
from the floor near one of the massive legs of the table with a quiet and 
peculiar attention 

 what ill become o th feller who sinks the trap asked slippery elm 

 the last day of the administration of a certain governor will long be remembered 
with pious reverence by the turnkeys of the various prisons on that day the merciful 
executive filled up the measure of his fame by setting free a batch of convicts thieves 
burglars and murderers in the course of six years this truly merciful executive granted 
about pardons 



the outcasts of the quaker city j 

 you ll obsa-rve that the bench on which he is to set is some irches 
away from the edge of the trap exclaimed devil-bug while the bench 
on the other side of the table is right in the middle o the consarn 

 death to the traitor muttered the vagabonds as the earthen jug pas 
sed from hand to hand death to the pork-hater 

 but who ll be the feller to stamp upon the knob exclaimed devil-bug 

 let s pull straws for it cried rusty jake this is capital monyga- 
naley put a lot o straws into a hat and the man as has the shortest 
does the thing 

 agreed agreed echoed the ruffians whose sparkling eyes betrayed the 
effects of the monongahela 

 here s a decent hat to put the straws in exclaimed slippery elm pro 
ducing a piece of dark felt which in remote ages might have been a hat 

 and here s the straws cried rusty jake seizing a handful of loose 
straw from the floor near a brick pillar he proceeded to sever it into various 
pieces with a knife which he drew from his rags these pieces numbering 
thirty-four in all were poured into the fragment of a hat which was placed 
on the end of the table 

there was a dead silence one by one with the same look of stolid in 
difference each thief cut-throat and robber advanced each turned away his 
face as he placed his hand in the hat and then seizing one of the strawa 
from the mass walked silently away 

luke harvey s turn came last 

 this grows interesting he muttered as he approached the table 

 heaven grant that the lot may fall on any one but me here i am in 
i pretty pickle a candidate for the honorable office of executioner for 

a jew however here goes he placed his hand in the hat 

 my fate is decided one way or the other 

 fellers measure your straws exclaimed devil-bug with quiet dignity 

they all grouped together thirty-four rude hands with the white hand 
of luke among them were ranged in a row there was a pause you could 
hear each man gasping for breath and then a loud laugh broke on the air 

 mister with the red beard yours is the shortest exclaimed devil-bug 
 the job is for you 

for a moment luke stood stricken dumb with a strange fear he must 
sither murder or be murdered the eye of devil-bug was fixed upon him 
all hope of escape was in vain 

 i will procure the pacquet at all hazards muttered luke with set teeth 
and he confirmed his resolution by a solemn oath 

 here comes the cripple cried devil -bug ho ho he murmured 
m the chest o gold and other leetle property is mine 

as he spoke a shuffling footstep was heard and the light presently shone 
upon the large face and distorted body of the jewish dwarf gabriel von 



 the death-angels 

gelt he came forward with one hand resting upon his fragment of a cheat 
while his dark eyes glanced around with an expression full of inquiry 

well folksh good eveningsh he said blandly i venders vot thev 
means by looking plack at me he muttered to himself folksh i shay 
good eveningsh 

the vagabonds turned away from him with evident signs of disgust 

 the fact is my friend cried rusty jake with a sneer there s been 
reports of a wery injurious natur circulatin in these parts lately in regard 
to your karacter 

 brick-top wants to speak a word with you in regard to your escape 
said devil-bug in a friendly whisper don t mind these cut-throats 

 sit down there if you please said luke in a surly tone 

von gelt sate down on one side of the table while luke seated himself 
opposite 

the thieves retired a few paces from the table and devil-bug leaning 
against a brick pillar silently observed the scene 

a trifling fact may be recorded in this place right over the head of the 
jew the arching ceiling descended in a point with a substantial pulley of 
of iron inserted in the rude plastering the original object of this pulley 
was evident a thick rope passed through the pulley dropped down into 
the pit of monk-hall through the trap-door lowering or raising the hogsheads 
of rich old wine which were formerly deposited in that vast cellar at the 
present moment the light from the table shone upon a slight but strong cord 
which arranged in a slip-knot right over the head of the jew was passed 
through the pulley and along the ceiling until it hung in loose coils around 
a stout iron hook projecting from a massy brick pillar 

devil-bug stood beside this pillar watching the rope and the jew with 
evident interest 

luke harvey leaned over the pine table until his face well-nigh touched 
the countenance of gabriel von gelt 

 i have ten words to say to you he exclaimed in his natural voice 
on your answer to these ten words hangs your life make but a start 
show but a sign of emotion and you are a dead man 

 fader moses vat is dis von gelt s florid countenance grew pale 
as ashes the slip-knot above his head began slowly to descend as devil- 
bug touched the other end of the rope 

 don t you see by the looks of this band that they have resolved - n 

 on what the slip-knot dangled in the air within three inches of 
the jew s head 

 on your murder 

 fader abraham cried von gelt with a start and his dark hair brushed 
against the quivering rope 

 start one step whispered luke and i will stamp upon the spring 
vhich sets the trap in motion your life is in danger i alone can sav 
ou alene can rescue you from the power of these devils 



the outcasts of the qua er city 

 den you are not von of dem faltered the jew supposh i betraysh you 

 give but a sign of such a purpose and ha ha the trap beneath the 
table falls 

hurray there you feller with the red head exclaimed devil-bug 
 finish this little business 

 little bushinesh echoed the thunder-struck jew 

luke leaned gently forward and fixing his eyes on the terrified counte 
nance of the jew whispered a single name 

ellis mortimer 

 veres you hear dat name cried the jew with another start 

 you were concerned in the great forgery committed on the house cf 
livingstone harvey co about a month since you have about your 
person certain documents which will convict algernon fitz-cowles of the 
forgery give me those documents and the ten thousand dollars which you 
have about your person are yours as for the murder you can turn 
 state s evidence it will just suit you being a jew give me the papers 

 i vill die first muttered gabriel trembling in every limb 

 then by heaven i spring the trap luke hissed the whisper in his ear 

 i conshents cried gabriel dere s de pacquet 

luke grasped the prize and buried it among his rags 

 i say red-head what are yo up to there growled devil-bug as he 
gave the rope another shake be quick i say 

a growling murmur arose from the band of thieves luke saw that no 
time was to be lost 

 i say gabriel can you run or fight he whispered if you can run 
yonder s the door i fight myself 

gabriel was rising from his feel with a look of horror and fright stamped 
on every line of his face when devil-bug strode silently forward at his back 
he extended his huge hand and the slip-knot encircled the neck of the jew 
gabriel felt the cord around his neck he sprang forward in horror and as 
he sprang the massive foot of devil-bug was stamped upon the knob the 
trap the tables and the candles fell and ere a moment all was darkness 
in that single moment of light and horror luke harvey starting back from 
the edge of the chasm beheld a sight that he might never forget he beheld 
the jew struggling in the air above the blackness of the void he saw the rope 
which tightened round his neck at every struggle and like some horrible 
vision that large face with red skin turning to purple and the mouth agape 
and the dark eyes bulging from their sockets rushed before him a single 
moment he beheld that sight and all was darkness 

the wild yell of devil-bug mingled with the hurrah of the out-casts 
then a choaking groan gurgled from the darkness above the trap-door then 
the sharp sound of a rope snapping strand by strand and then another 
gurgling groan 

 he dies hard muttered devil-bug through the darkness 



 the death-angels 

a light flashed suddenly over the vault from the western entrance luklt 
lookod for tne corse of the jew quivering in the air it was gone the 
rope broken off near the ceiling waved gently to and fro and a dead whi 
zing sound came up from the depths of the pit like the echo of a heavy body 
dashing into fragments against the hard earth 

while luke s heart quivered with a strange horror he looked toward the 
western entrance and saw the huge forms of musquito and glow-worm ad 
vancing with torches in their hands while two paces before them a figure 
muffled in the thick folds of a sweeping black cloak rushed hurriedly onward 
leading the way toward the trap luke knew the stranger at a glance 
he looked upon him for a single moment and then silently drew two pistols 
from among his rags 

 devil-bug you are betrayed shouted the stranger as he stood in the 
glare of the light beside the trap-door yonder stands the traitor 

 ha fitz-cowles muttered devil-bug and for a moment as a wild 
frown darkened over his brow he seemed hesitating on whom to spring 
luke harvey or the forger 

 seize him cried fitz-cowles as a dark scowl impressed his swarthy 
countenance with the malignity of a devil he has betrayed your secrets 
and your lives 

 come on my civet cut sneered luke dashing aside his red wig and 
beard as he stood with a pistol extended in either hand i ll sweeten you 
with a new perfume the smell of powder 

the thieves drew their knives and pistols and silently circled round luke 
harvey and his antagonist it was a striking picture the tall form of 
luke clad in rags standing on one side of the chasm each hand grasping 
a pistol the well-proportioned figure of fitz-cowles with a cloak falling 
from his shoulder on the other his raised arm flashing a bowie knife in the 
light while at the head of the pit stood the deformed savage devil-bug with 
his band of outcasts circling in the back ground for a moment the savage 
held his bloodhounds in check 

 upon him the dog upon him shouted devil-bug pointing to luke 

with one movement the ruffian band advanced their upraised knives glit- 
ering in the torch-light 

 i will die hard i tell you said luke with set teeth as he placed his 
back against a pillar come on blood-hounds come on forger and 
knave lay but a hand on me and your brains shall plaster these cellar 
walls 

 hew him down you dogs screamed fitz-cowles hoarse with rage 

there was a quiet determination in the eyes of luke that for a momen 
held the vagabonds in awe it was a brave sight one man against thirty- 
tour ruffians with a well-dressed bravo hallooing them on to a deed of cow 
ardice and blood 

forming a half-circle the thieves advanced slowly and silently while 



outcasts of the quaker city 

devil-bug stole behind the pillar there was the report of a pistol and thick 
clouds of smoke rolled to the ceiling of the vault 

 ha ha screamed luke i told you that i would die hard and the 
form of a grim vagabond lay quivering and sprawling on the verge of the 
chasm 

at this moment a rough hand came gliding round the pillar its talon 
fingers encircled the neck of luke with a grasp like death while the whole 
band of outcasts rushed upon him with one sudden spring another instant 
passed he lay on the floor with the knives of the outcasts flashing above 
him the knee of devil-bug on his breast and the hands of the monster 
tightening round his throat 

 the peril is past shouted fitz-cowles from the other side of the chasm 
 another throw of fortune s dice and i am saved 

a puffy face adorned by a curly wig was thrust from behind the pillar 
at his back 

 here s a family party ce la est un par tie dome stique as we say in very 
domestic french i tried to sell fitz-cowles to harvey he would nt buy 
me so i wormed what secrets i could concerning harvey out of the police 
and incontinently sold him to fitz-cowles we is always on hand when 
black mail is to be had 

with this half-murmured remark little poodle drew his bewigged head 
behind the pillar again 

 why there s rather a muss here my feller said a cheerful voice at 
the shoulder of fitz-cowles the millionaire turned and beheld the round 
visage of major mulhill appearing between the wooly heads of the negroes 
who stood holding the torches at his back 

 yes y-e-s whispered fitz-cowles i ve the scoundrel safe safe at 
tast into the pit with him devil-bug 

a deep groan came from luke s lips as he felt himself slowly dragged 
along the floor toward the chasm 

 i venders how that ill vork chuckled old devil-bug two outcasts 
held the feet of the pinioned man while the others were grouped around 
gazing silently upon the scene 

at this moment the torch-light flickering fitfully along the corners of the 
vault gave the rude walls the nooks and crevices of the place a wild and 
fantastic appearance for an instant it seemed to fitz-cowles that the 
dim shadows assumed the forms of men skulking in the darkness of the place 

luke groaned in agony his feet dangled over the chasm 

ex-cuse me curnel if i admire the pattern o your cravat said the 
redoubtable major mulhill fingering the dark scarf of fitz-cowles with a 
playful air quite genteel does it fit tight round your neck he 
inserted his fingers between the cravat and the neck as he spoke 

 take care you ll choke me muttered fitz-cowles with a start a 
biand smile broke over mulhill s fat face 
 



 the death-angels 

 now my gemmen will you read this he tightened his grasp around 
the throat of the forger and displayed a broad slip of paper before his very 
eyes it s only a love letter from a ga- 

 what does this mean gasped fitz-cowles hands off his words 
were drowned by a wild shriek that quivered through the cellar 

 seize him seize the murderer of paul western shrieked a woman s 
voice and the queenly form of long-haired bess stood on the verge of the 
chasm her dark hair showering aside from her pale face and her black eye 
flashing with a glance like madness 

there was a moment of terrible and confused action devil-bug started 
up from his victim leaving his form trembling on the verge of the pit and 
with him the vagabond band drew their knives and turned to face the new 
comer one wild murmur of despair quivered from lip to lip by the side 
of every cut-throat there stood the form of a burly police officer at the back 
of bess along the cellar around fitz-cowles and mulhill circled a firm and 
determined band some hundred strong with maces and pistols in their hands 

 fight ye devils screamed devil-bug but the band of police suddenly 
advanced surrounding the thieves and compressing them in one mass by 
the superiority of their numbers in a moment the thieves were disarmed 
and beaten to the floor with maces devil-bug clenched his weaponless 
hands and gnashed his teeth in the effort to bite the feet that trampled him 
down but it was in vain 

as he lay trodden beneath the feet of some dozen police officers luke 
harvey sprang over the chasm with one bound and seized fitz-cowles by 
the throat the forger was deathly pale his under lip quivered like a dry 
leaf in the wind 

 now coward the hour of reckoning has come fitz-cowles lay on 
the floor with the foot of luke harvey on his breast do you know those 
papers shrieked luke ha ha ha do you feel yourself within the 
prison s walls already do your dapper limbs already feel the cheering 
warmth of the convicts dress and then the manacles and the lash ho ho 

 this is wot i calls a cheerin scene was the smiling remark of mulhill 

the sound of a woman s voice tremulous with remorse and agony shrieked 
through the dead-vault 

 he stands before me shrieked long-haired bess gazing with starting 
eyes into the blackness of the chasm he stands before me his pale face 

clotted with drops of blood he wronged me and he died oh god 

his dying shriek rings in my ears but he shall be avenged 

the gallows for me you hell-cat screamed devil-bug raising his 
head from the floor while a fiendish grin convulsed his face the gallows 
for me you hell-cat he shook his manacled hands together ha ha 
hoo venders how that ill vork 



the oak chamber of hawkewood 



chapter second 

the oak chamber of hawkewood 
dorj livingstone gains the coronet for which she perilled her soul 

 a fiwe old-time mansion dora exclaimed livingstone as he crossed 
the threshhold of the chamber that was a solemn hall thro which we 
passed with its gloomy pictures and quaint carvings in dark stone and then 
the stairway dora with its steps of massive oak by my life i like this 
mansion of hawkewood it has a wild baronial look 

 and this chamber with its old-time furniture and antiquarian appoint 
ments exclaimed dora with a smile has it a characteristic name 

 it is called the oak chamber of hawkewood you see the walls are 
concealed by huge panels of dark oaken wainscot and the floor is covered 
by an old-fashioned carpet in yonder corner stands a bed with dark pur 
ple hangings and here from this lordly hearth the glareefa cheerful 
wood fire flashes round the place i like it dora 

 and then this round table of dark walnut standing in the centre of the 
room with a gothic arm-chair on either side certainly the place looks v 
like the den of some old monk half wizard half antiquary 

 in that chair my father breathed his last whispered livingstone with 
a sudden sternness of tone and on that table words have been written 
which were followed by deeds of bloodshed and horror 

with a kind gesture he pointed to the arm-chair on one side of the round 
table motioning his wife to a seat while he sat down on the opposite side 

 we ll have a cup of coffee before you change your travelling dress my 
love said livingstone with marked kindness of tone i forgot to inform 
you that by a careless mistake i dated the invitations to our friends for to 
morrow instead of to-day you will have to endure the solitude of this 
place until the morning when old hawkewood will put on a face of smiles 
bye the bye my dear i have despatched all the servants to town in order 
that my various preparations for the christmas festival may be completed 
old davidson and his wife will wait on you until the morrow 

there was something so natural and commonplace in all this that dora 
forgot the strange wildness of manner which livingstone had once or twice 
manifested within the past hour and her own dark thoughts were for tho 
moment silenced by his calm tone and composed look 

 ha ha cried dora with a laughing smile i can endure the solitude 
of hawkewood for a single night unless indeed yon bed with its gloomy 
hangings should chance to be haunted oy pale ghosts or hideous dreams 

 oh your dreams will be sweet and undisurbed i pledge my life for 



 the death-angels 

it said livingstone with a peculiar look which escaped the eye of 
his wife 

there was a knocking at the door and in a moment the trembling form 
f the old gardener entered the chamber his long and slender arms em 
braced a shapeless mass of canvass entwined with thick ropes and looking 
cor all the world like the sails of a vessel tied confusedly together 

 squire whar shall i put this bundle exclaimed davidson it looks 
imazin big but it taint so heavy as you d think 

 what have we here exclaimed dora looking at her husband with a 
glance of wonder 

 only the scenery for our private theatricals said livingstone in a 
careless tone you may as well stand it against the wall behind the bed 
davidson to-morrow we ll have it unpacked and now my old boy he 
added placing his hand familiarly on the gardiner s shoulder tell your 
dame to make one of her best cups of coffee for myself and mrs living 
stone don t you remember davidson how fond i used to be of your 
wife s coffee 

 and i will say cried the old man rubbing his hands together that 
my hannah s ee-kal in the way o makin coffee and right strong coffee 
with good cream to make it look yaller as goold an a lump o loaf sugar 
to give it a taste o sweetenin aint to be found in these parts 

with this remarkable tribute to dame hannah s abilities the old gardi- 
icr left the room and livingstone and his wife were alone once more 

from the broad hearth the crackling hickory fire sent a ruddy glow 
around the room which now obscured the light of the wax candles standing 
on the round table or again dying suddenly away left the place involved 
in comparative gloom 

gazing steadily in the face of his wife livingstone sat on one side of the 
table his broad chest enveloped in a dark frock coat presenting a fine con- 
trast to the form of dora whose every outline of beauty and grace was 
disclosed by the folds of her dark green travelling habit they sat in the 
centre of that strange old room with the dark wainscot of the walls the 
heavy curtaining of the bed the massive frames of the windows looking to 
the east half-concealed by sombre hangings and the spacious outlines of 
the fire-place affording the effective details of a picture in which the form 
of the merchant and his wife were the striking and central objects of 
attention 

the face of the merchant was deadly pale yet an expression of im- 
moveable calmness lingered on every feature the massive brow towering 
above the dark eyebrows was full of silent thought and the slight smile 
playing round the expressive mouth gave his face a mild and benignant 
look which was in fearful contrast with the discolored circles of flesh be- 
neatn each eye or the sunken outlines of each bronzed cheek the eyea 
of livingstone wore a look never to vgte forgotten large azure and calm 



the oak chamber of hawkewood 

hey shone in a strange light which seemed to flicker around each eyeball 
ike rays around a lamp 

her form flung back in the arm-chair in a position of grace and ease 
dora s face afforded a vivid contrast to the countenance of her husband 
the dark eyes swam in a mild melting light the smiling cheeks were flushed 
with warm rich hues the high forehead was full of soul and the small 
mouth with its lips of deep voluptuous red was curved in a winning smile 

 dora my wife you are very beautiful said livingstone in that deep- 
toned voice which sounded from the depths of his chest we have now 
been married one year you have been to me a faithful true and affection 
ate wife as a slight tribute of my love let me place in your hands this 
christmas gift 

he drew from his breast a small casket of gold richly set with jewels 
dora received it with an exclamation of delight 

a gift like this would not shame the bride of an emperor she mur 
mured as her delicate fingers enclosed the princely gift 

 that casket encloses a gift yet more precious than the jewels that glitter 
on its exterior said livingstone as he rose from his seat excuse me 
one moment my love t have some trifling orders to give to davidson in 
an instant i will return with the key of the casket 

he advanced to the door of the chamber and passed out into the spacious 
landing at the head of the stair-way the dim beams of the stars obscured 
by clouds streamed through a solitary window in the southern wall giving 
a faint light to the oaken floor and the massive walls closing the door of 
the oak chamber livingstone stood with his back toward the window gaz 
ing down the dim stairway with folded arms and compressed lips presently 
he sound of footsteps was heard a slight tremor ran over livingstone s 
powerful frame and the next instant the form of davidson was seen through 
the dusky shadows ascending the stairway with a waiter in his hands 

 i will take the coffee davidson while you hurry down-stairs and have my 
horse brought to the hall door business requires my immediate return to 
philadelphia lose no time my good fellow but let it be done without an 
instant s delay 

taking the waiter from the astonished servant he advanced to the window 
and laid it down gently on the oaken sill in an instant the form of david 
son was lost in the shadows of the stairway and soon the faint echo of hia 
footsteps sounded faintly from the hall below 

livingstone stood in the faint light of the stars gazing steadily on the 
waiter whose dark surface was relieved by two large cups of white porce 
lain smoking with fragrant coffee 

for a moment the merchant stood silent as the grave his chest heaved 
and his lip quivered with emotion with a low muttered groan he drew 
forth from h s breast a small phial of glittering silver 

he raked it in the dim light and the fingers which clasped it trembled 






 the death-angels 

like dry leaves in the storm then his blue eyes was fixed upon it with a 
gaze of horrible intensity and a single large and scalding tear starling from 
the hot eyelid rolled slowly down his bronzed cheek 

 my wife he groaned and still absorbed by an awful effort to control 
his reeling intellect he stood regarding that silver phial with the same wild 
and intense stare 

meanwhile dora sate in the arm-chair beside the table with the golden 
casket resting lightly in her hand 

her husband closed the door and a wild expression mingling hope and 
tear love and hate guilt and shame brightened and darkened over the face 
of the wife 

placing the casket on the table she thrust her hands in her bosorn and 
while the agitation deepened over her queenly face she displayed two objects 
in the light one was the notq given to her by luke harvey the evening 
before the other was the small phial of deadly poison which she had pre 
pared with such fearful secresy and care 

 on one side a coronet beckons me on the other stands livingstone 
with love in his look and honor on his brow shall i choose the coronet 
then livingstone lays a lifeless corse within this very hour shall i trample 
the coronet under foot and subside from all my high dreams into a patient 
and gentle wife patient and gentle suppose livingstone is dead even 
then fitz-cowles plan of immediate flight is ill-judged worse than foolish 
livingstone once dead i must act the disconsolate widow walk broken 
hearted at his funeral and after a decent lapse of time inherit the vast for- 
tune left to me by my affectionate husband my brain whirls and i know 
not which to choose the phial or the letter the one secures the eternal 
secresy of luke the other lays a coronet at my feet but the price is terri 
ble the dead body of my husband and then my oath my oath 

as the thought of that oath which in sight of the awful god calling his 
angels to witness with her heart filled with pure emotions and her hands 
clasped in the hands of the only man she ever loved in solemn truth as the 
thought of that oath flashed over her soul dora half started from the chair 
and uttered a low-toned shriek 

livingstone s footstep broke on her ear with a hurried movement she 
buried the letter and the phial in her bosom calling a calm smile to her 
face she awaited the approach of her husband 

 here is the coffee my dear said livingstone in a careless tone as he 
entered and placed the waiter on the round table it is a long while smce 
i tasted coffee in this house but i can commend old hannah s coffee abovo 
all other s for its delicious flavor is nt it singular my dear that so few- 
people in the world know how to prepare even tolerable coffee 

dora looked into the pale face of her husband with a glance of vacant 
wonder if there was a thing in the world that he sincerely contemned it 



the oak chamber of hawkewood - 

was a common-place remark on any subject at all but the pleasures of eat 
ing and drinking in especial this colloquial remark on the peculiar merits 
of old hannah s coffee might well excite the wonder of the merchant s wife 
there was a volume of awful meaning concealed under the trifling words 
and careless tone of livingstone 

seating himself beside the table the merchant raised one of the porcelain 
cups to his lips and sipped its fragrant contents 

reclining in the arm chair her beautiful face glowing in the mild beams 
of the light and her rounded limbs disposed in an attitude of careless lan 
guor dora followed the example of her husband and raising the other cup 
to her lips athirst from the fatigue of travel she drank profusely of the 
smoking coffee 

at this moment livingstone s blue eyes did not glare nor shine nor glis 
ten they seemed to blaze with a glassy lustre as deadly as light emitted 
from the eye of the rattle-snake ere it kills its victim 

bye the bye my dear i must mention a singular piece of news which 
overtook me on the road to hawkewood this evening i have spoken to you 
of the noble descent of my family have told you that livingstone was an 
assumed name that my grand-father left the broad lands of his barony in the 
hands of distant kinsmen when he sought the solitudes of the new world 

the words of the merchant had a strange interest for dora half-start- 
ing from the chair she listened with flashing eyes and parted lips to the whis 
pered tones of her husband 

 during my father s life the last of the race of kinsmen died leaving the 
old barony without a lord my father hastened to england and placing his 
claim to the lands and title in the hands of able lawyers awaited the result 
with an impatience that clung to him until his dying hour here was the 
difficulty our ancestor had left england having first circulated the rumor 
that he was dead and dead without an heir he vished to bury his name 
and the dishonor which the treachery of a woman had brought upon it in 
eternal oblivion my father s lawyers found it almost impossible to prove 
the identity of our ancestor with the self-exiled lord that impossibility 
has now been overcome while my father s ashes rest in the family vault 
of hawkewood side by side with that ancestor who exiled himself from his 
native soil hold in my hand the pacquet which informs the philadelphia 
merchant that restored to the lands and title of his race he is now 

 yes yes muttered dora as her face grew ashy pale speak on for 
god s sake lwngstone yes you are now 

the lord of longford said livingstone in a clear deliberate tone 

dora rose to her feet with a half muttered shriek 

 a title and in england she murmured the fulfilment of my wildest 
dream lady of longford ha already i behold myself the mistress of 
broad lands already i move in the throng of a royal court already i feel 
the coronet encircling my brow 



 the death-angels 

 the coronet of worms muttered livingstone with livid lips as the 
broken words of his wife fell indistinctly on his ear your broad lands 
a pitiful grave eight feet long and two feet wide 

 of course albert said dora resuming her seat you will at once 
proceed to england and assume the estates and title 

 both of us will undertake a journey soon but not to england muttered 
livingstone would you advise me to give up my rights the rights of an 
american citizen he continued aloud for the rent-roll of an english barony 
and the empty sound of a title 

 your rights as an american citizen sneered dora comprising among 
other inestimable privileges the right to count one among a pitiful aristo 
cracy whose high deeds are written in the ledger of a broken bank which 
chronicles the wholesale robbery of the widow and the orphan accomplished 
under the solemn sanction of the law f glorious rights indeed 

dora shall we look at your christmas gift said the merchant with a 
calm smile 

dora s eye grew suddenly glassy was it from the overwhelming emotion 
which followed livingstone s announcement 

 i will move among the proudest nobles of the british court rank 
title power the prophecy is fulfilled the boon is mine without the 

crime how my head swims i feel giddy my heart ah i am too 

much affected by this joyful intelligence 

as these words fell wild and trembling from his lips while her cheek grew 
crimson and ashy by turns livingstone sate regarding her with the same 
look that glares from the eye of the tiger ere he crushes the victim at his 
feet 

dora started from her seat she pressed her hands on her forehead the 
glassy film which veiled her eyes was succeeded by a wild and flashing 
lustre 

 why livingstone she cried in a strange whisper the room is filled 
with strangers ha ha she laughed resuming her seat again with a look 
of calm loveliness the suddenness with which you imparted this unex 
pected news has given me a violent head-ache 

 zouw muttered livingstone in a tone inaudible to his wife fiend 
be still f a little while and i am yours was he speaking to the devil 
that lay couched near his heart the devil of madness 

 come dora look at your christmas present he exclaimed in a calm 
voice as he opened the casket 

dora leaned forward until her beautiful countenance well-nigh touched 
the face of her husband 

ha ha she laughed why livingstone what child s play is this 
you promise me jewels and here is but a lock of hair mine i do believe 
enclosed within this casket 

twc locks of hair my wife spoke the deep voice of livingstone 
 yours and fitz-cowles 



the oak chamber of hawkewood 

 mine and fitz-cowles echoed dora with a look of vacant wonder 
 what mean you 

livingstone replied with a single word leaning forward his blue eyes 
flashing with a glance of fearful meaning he looked like a fiend blasting a 
guilty soul with a single look 

monk-hall 

dora looked steadily in his face but her senses whirled in a delirium that 
lasted for a single moment 

 monk-hall she echoeu and her face was like death what means 
this jest 

jest echoed livingstone in a husky voice vile adultress call 
you this a jest two nights ago bending over the bed in which you and 
your paramour lay reposing in your shame i severed these glossy locks of 
hair as witnesses of your damning guilt 

livingstone s voice was fearfully calm as he spoke these words 

 is it a jest now the sneer quivered on his lips and his blue eye glared 
with an expression of ferocious hatred 

vain is the power of speech to picture the horror which convulsed the 
frame of proud dora livingstone as this awful discovery rushed upon her 
soul like an ante-past of hell 

sinking in the chair with her hands clasped quiveringly together for a 
moment consciousness reason and mind were gone 

am i awake am i dreaming my brain whirls all all 

discovered oh shame eternal shame 

such were the unconcerned ravings that fell from her trembling lips 

 and you must die shrieked the frenzied voice of livingstone you 
must die ere the hand of this watch tells the hour of seven you will be a 
lifeless corse 

 poisoned poisoned i see it all now mut 
tered dora with her head resting on her shoulder and her eyes closed in a 
dreamy half consciousness she lay thrown helplessly in the chair 

 livingstone she exclaimed in a low but firm voice as slowly rising 
on her feet she looked him in the face livingstone my husband my 
friend i am most guilty but i can face death without a murmur 
ther attitude was sublime so weak so trembling so pale and yet with 
that awful stoicism on her beautiful brow j 

it was a terrible sight for livingstone for a moment he trembled from 
head to foot that man of iron nerves and fearless heart he trembled but 
it was not with one relenting throb 

he rushed from her side was gone a moment and then stood before hei 
once again his tall form rising in all its majesty while with a hand of iron 
fixidity he pointed to the object at his feet 

 look i he cried in a voice of thunder 

dora bent forward she pressed her hands to her burning forehead and 



 the death-angels 

the light from the hearth flashing over her downcast face gave a terrible 
glow to every convulsed feature one look and the shriek died on her lips 
at her feet in the full light of the fire lay the coffin covered with black 
cloth and with a silver plate glittering on its bosom 
one look and she read the name the day the death 
 our private theatricals muttered livingstone with a madman s icy 
sneer this day madam you rehearsed your own funeral ha ha 
do you remember how we rode to hawkewood first came your carriage 
then the hearse with the coffin of the deceased and then the chief mourner 
ha ha ha 

dora sank in the chair her hands were icy cold and her brain was a 
mass of molten flame burning through her eye-balls and her brow 

 it is fulfilled the coronet is on my brow yet it is a coronet of 

flame the room is filled with strangers ah ha they are noble lords 

and dames tread the halls of a royal court flames who fired 

these queenly robes who 

 oh god these hot coals upon my brain 

did you ever see a chained tiger glutting its fierce eyes with the agonies 
of the helpless victim whom the keeper s hand has thrust into its cage so 
livingstone sate with his glaring eyes fixed upon the frenzied face of his 
wife 

 the hand of the watch is on the hour of six in one hour she will be a 
lifeless mass over which the worms will crawl and revel this is my re 
venge no gushing blood falling from a white bosom tells the story of my 
wrong and its punishment but the soul bleeds yes yes i hear its life- 
drops falling from the ghastly wound i feast upon its quivering agonies 
the soul of my victim bleeds ha ha ha 

pale mute motionless sate fearless dora livingstone her eyes half 
closed her hands gently clasped her bosom faintly thobbing while her soul 
became the victim of a thousand frenzies 

 dora shrieked livingstone in the ear of the dying woman the hand 
of death is on you but i can save you i have an antidote to the poison 
which you sipped in your coffee 

 and you will give it me shrieked dora starting from her seat and 
seizing him by the hand the touch of those icy fingers thrilled him to the 
heart 

 give it you his voice sounded as though every syllable was torn from 
his heart three nights ago i bent over the bed in which you lay lapt 
in the arms of shame i listened for a word of repentance nay i tried to 
catch but one lingering syllable of regret not a word not a sound of peni 
tence you had sold yourself into shame and shame in its most polluted 
shape in that hour woman when my heart was breaking when my soul 
was torn from thought and reason when all the hopes of my life were gone 
tnd but one awful prospect lay before me a madman s cell through whose 



the oak chamber of hawkewood 

barred windows i beheld the grave of a suicide yawning for my corse then 
woman oh then i coined my existence into a vow by the majesty of 
god by the doom of hell by the awful desolation of my soul i swore to 
make you feel every throb of the agony whose fangs quivered through my 
heart 

i matured my revenge in silence i madman that i am through the 
course of two fearful days laid every snare to trap you into the power of 
the man whom you had dishonored dishonored i lured you to hawke- 
wood i gave you the poison i flung your coffin at your feet and now 
while death darkens horribly over your soul i dash you from me scorn 
your prayer for mercy glory in your last agonies and shriek in your freez 
ing ear dora dora my love my wife i can save you but i will not 
can save you but still you must die 

 yes he shrieked fixing his white lips together yes you must 
die the spirit of my race burns in my veins 

 livingstone faltered dora with a look of perfect consciousness it 

is hard to die am guilty but you will not cannot kill me spare me 

albert for your own sake oh spare me 

she knew that she was dying guilt shame reproach all were forgotten 
all she craved was life could she have fallen dead on the floor she would 
have hailed death without a murmur but to count each pulsation of her 
freezing blood to feel a separate agony in each throb of her bursting heart 
to meet death while her brain was reeling in a delirium that left her still 
conscious of her doom oh merciful god this was a hell far beyond the rude 
fancies with which superstition goads her crouching victims 

life life she shrieked spare me albert life 

 could every throb of your dying heart take voice and form and shriek 
for pity i tell you woman that still my answer would be dora you must die 

he turned away from her as in a voice of deliberate tone he spoke these 
final words of fate 

there was silence for a moment with the last impulse of her failing 
strength dora sprang forward she flung her arms around his neck 

an awful convulsion distorted livingstone s features 

 oh god he groaned 

these arms they had encircled his neck in the by-gone time of faith and 
peace that bosom heaving against his own so it had heaved and throb- 
bed in the days of his love but that beautiful face those eyes flashing super 
natural lustre that long black hair showering down over the queenly form 

livingstone trembled he made an effort to unwind her arms from his 
neck but in vain she kissed him yes with those ripe lips which had called 
him husband one year ago smiling like heaven all the while she kissed him 
and he shuddered her lips were like flame-coals 

 life she whispered in husky tones only life 

now was the awful moment now man of iron will is the instant of 
your fate this moment is destiny eternity heaven or hell to you 



 the death-angels 

an expression of pity smiled from his livid face but in an instant hit 
fixed determination called an awful frown to his view 

 woman he shrieked i have sworn it you must die 

he dashed her from him as he spoke her magnificent form swayed to 
and fro for a moment then with a look of terrible despair she fell back 
ward over her coffin into the x arm-chair 

 ha ha ha she screamed with a burst of maniac laughter ha 
ha these are brave steeds fitz-cowles away away with the 
night we leave all danger behind how softly the morning breaks oh 
beautiful h-u-s-h my mother is dying h-u-s-h that was her last 
groan livingstone claims me as his bride over the corse of my dead mo- 

ther heaven will bless our nuptuals yes yes ah how cold how 

dark how dread we are in the death-vault now i am not dead yet 
they bury me oh god oh god will no one burst this coffin lid how 
it presses on my bosom close close close oh for one gleam of god s 
light again oh for one breath of god s free air 

her dark eyes rolled in their sockets and with her white hands she 
dashed the tresses of her raven hair aside from her brow 

livingstone gazed upon her with folded arms he gazed upon the face of 
his wife paint me the agony of a lost soul and i will picture for you the 
awful resolution that distorted every feature of his face the cold sweat 
on the brow of the dying woman was not more clammy than the beaded 
drops on the forehead of the husband 

oh god livingstone groaned as a feeling of mercy came stealing 
over his heart he was afraid that he might relent 

dora rose once more upon her feet she rose in an attitude of fearful 
sublimity her tali form towering in all its beauty and pride she dashed 
the dark hair from her clammy brow she raised her hand on high with a 
gesture of command zenobia on her throne with the spoils of all the na 
tions scattered round her feet could never have looked more sternly beautiful 

 livingstone she shrieked with that upraised hand quivering in the 
air while the cold sweat glistened in beads along her cheek and brow 
livingstone you must save me cannot will not die 

there was an awful will beaming from that woman s face her lips 
were painfully compressed and her dark eyes glared with a fierce light 
wild as madness and as determined as death 

 will not die she shrieked clenching her white hands in agony and 
despair ere the words died on her lips she fell heavily to the floor she lay 
with her head pillowed on the coffin with her limbs flung stiffly over the 
carpet while her cheek was cold and pale as marble her lips they had 
grown suddenly white hung gently apart and her dark eyes glazed stead 
iiy on the ceiling a glassy film was on each eye she was dead the 
proud and peerless dora livingstone lay on that floor a lifeless corse 



the oak chamber of hawrewood 

 there shrieked livingstone in a voice choked by despair there 
tnere is all that was my wife 

he fell on his knees beside her coffin at this moment a thin stream of 
blood stole from her lips and trickled over her face and bosom marking its 
progress with a line of ghastly red she had died within the hour hei 
mighty heart had burst its channels and that blood whose every pulsation 
was a thought now stained the whiteness of her bosom 

the madman knelt beside his victim for two long days and two weary 
nights he had anticipated the scene with his reason tottering all the 
while he had prepared the accumulating agonies with which to torture her 
closing hour the journey to hawkewood planned with such cool delibe 
ration the coffin inscribed with her name these were alike the work of a 
madman 

he knelt beside his victim was it a drop of death sweat or a tear that 
trickled down her face 

not a word passed from his lips but while his blue eyes shone with one 
fixed expression he tore aside the robe from the breast of the corse the 
light shone on her bosom so beautiful and yet so white and cold and over 
its alabaster skin marring the beauty of the blue veins trickled the thin 
stream of blood mingling with the tears that fell from the hot eyeballs of the 
murderer 

the light from the table and the warm glow from the hearth-side streamed 
over the muscular form of livingstone kneeling beside the coffin with the 
form of his dead wife resting on his arms the contrast was full of terrible 
interest his bronzed face with the livid lips and the glaring blue eyes her 
pale countenance with the parted lips stained with blood and the dark eyes 
glassy with death the lord of longford with his lady in his arms 

 you have won your coronet dora but it is of worms you have won 
your empire but it is a narrow grave here here lies all that was my wife 

laying her gently on the coffin he silently arose one look at the dead 
body and he passed from the room into the darkness of the stairway it was 
but a moment ere he stood in the large hall of the mansion where a small 
lamp suspended from the ceiling flung a dismal light around 

 davidson he cried in hasty and impatient tones 

the withered figure of the old man emerged from a side door 

 your horse is saddled at the door squire livingstone 

 he calls me squire muttered livingstone with a mocking smile 
 squire and i am a lord f look ye davidson i must return to town on 
business do not disturb mrs livingstone before morning she is tired and 
would have a long sleep 

grasping the fur cap which he had worn to hawkewood from a side 
table he strode through the hali door in a moment the clatter of a horse s 
hoofs echoed from the road leading to the mansion gate mingled with a wild 
hurrah 



 the death-angels 

in the early dawn of the morning a noble horse with the saddle oil nia 
back covered with dust and the bridle thrown loosely over his neck was 
seen wandering without a rider along the public highway it was the steed 
of livingstone 

for one hour the light burned merrily in the oak chamber and the cheer- 
ful glow of fire gave warmth and comfort to the place but the corse of the 
woman and the coffin were gone from the floor while a plate of glittering 
silver gleamed among the hearthside ashes

with this cheerful sentiment on his lips devil-bug glanced around his 
den while his solitary eye twinkled with a mocking glee 

lighted by the mingled beams of the lamp on the table and the cheerful 
coal fire burning in the grate the doorkeeper s den was tenanted by some 
five or six individuals whose dress and appearance was in strong contrast 

silent and alone on one side of the fire-place was fitz-cowles his face 
pressed against the manacles which imprisoned his wrists while his feet 
rested on the rounds of the chair and his knees touched his forehead a 
more perfect picture of shame mortification and hopelessness cannot be 
imagined 

forming a group on the opposite side of the fire were the respectable wor

with an expression of lugubrious solemnity the distorted face of devil- 
hug with the matted hair falling thick and tangled over the protuberant

brow stood out boldly in the light while his solitary eye glared and his 
wide lips quivered with a mocking sneer 

at the head of the table smoking a huge german pipe sate our friend major 
rappahannock mulhill his red round face beaming with an agreeable smile 
as with his half closed eyes he gazed around the place luke harvey in the 
rags of brick-top sat by his shoulder his long dark hair falling in lank

there s somethin so jolly in seein a live man walking to a gallows that i 
could nt help joinin in with em hurray ses i hurray for the gibbet 
the good old gallows law forever an amen 

 charley did n t say a word arter that but went up the gallow s steps 
without so much as a start was n t it a grand sight for us fellers on tbe 
platform there was the marshall a fine fat faced feller there was the 
parson in his white cravat and black clothes there was i devil-bug the 
hangman with the crape over my face and there was the poor devil as

the house tops away off yonder and far down the streets hurray my 
boy there s a big crowd come to see you die and so wot s the use o grum- 
blin about yer mother and sister and a cussed white pidgeon 

 the mob giv a howl it was near twelve o clock and they wanted 
their show 

it wants ten minnits o th time ses the marshall an the parson 
comes up to charley and taps him on the shoulder and ses he look up 
my friend god is merciful let us pray 

and then we all kneeled down and the parson made a short prayer 
about the mercy o god and the widders and orphans and them deluded 
devils as had n t sich a good gospel an sich a stout gallows while he 
was prayin i saw two gentlemen with knowin faces slyly creepin up the 
ladder and lookin over the edge o th platform i know d ern well i d 



the hangman s glee 

stole dead bodies for em a hundred times they were doctors a-waitin 
for the dead body o charley the english boy 

the parson cuts his prayer off short and we all gits on our feet ag in 

 come charley ses i donl be frightened an i fixes the knot behind his 
ear a delicate knot it was you know it was tied right behind the ear 
so that his fall would break his neck like that then i felt his smooth 
neck and ses i it ill soon be over charley and you wont think anything 
more of yer mother or yer sister or that cussed white pidgeon 

 feller ses he yer honest here s all i have to giv yo keep it 
for my sake 

 an he giv me the striped handkercher from his neck it was purty 
hot i tell yo but a shiver ran over me when he did this 

time s up ses the marshall the mob giv a yell the doctors 
watin for the body comes up a step higher on the ladder and the parson 
smacked his lips as tho he felt uncommon hungry 

 a glass o water ses charley in a faint way but still as firm as a 
rock a boy with blue eyes an yaller hair was hoisted on a man s shoul 
der s from among the mob till he was even with the platform 

 god bless yo my boy ses charley an may yo never have a 
mother an a sister a-sittin at the cottage door a-waitin fur yo to come 
home when yer a-hangin in some far off land hangin like a dog i 

he takes the glass o water he looks at it for a minnit and then at the 
sky and the sun and the great big crowd and the roofs of the houses filled 
with people i ll never forgit that look his eyes looked as if they was 
set afire and his lower lip worked like a bit o twisted rope 

 i am innocent ses he and then cool as you please he pours the tum 
bler o water right down on the platform floor 

that water will dry up but my blood will never dry up from your 
soil while yonder sun shines 

 time s up ses the marshall i stuck the white cap on his forehead 
i draw d it over his eyes hurray what a look he giv as the cap came 
down over his forehead he stood in the centre o th platform with the cap 
over his eyes an the rope around his neck the rnob held their breath 
n that big crowd you could n t hear the sound of a human voice 

 with one kick o my foot i pushed away the trap for a minnit the 
sun seemed dark and the next minnit ho hoo there quiverin strug- 
glin twistin was the body of a man plungin at the end of a rope with 
his tongun black as a hat stickin out from under the edge o th white 
tap hurray 

 there was a noise like water pourin from a jug turned up-side down 
there was a plunge and a jerk and then the body o the poor devil quivered 
like a leaf the mob gave one yell which sounded as tho fairmount darr 
had broke loose with a devil shoutin from every wave you could see 



 the death-angels 

quiverin run over the body of the boy from head to foot may-be ne heered 
that yell may-be he see d strange sights in tother world who knows 

 for thirty minutes we kept him hanging for thirty minutes the mob yelled 
and cursed and swore and hurrahed 

 but when i cut the dead body down that was the time for fun to see 
the doctors huddle the carcase into the pine coffin to see the parson hurry 
one way the marshall another to see the soldiers march off with old devil- 
 bug in their midst guardin him from danger 
- v gt ho-hoo this individooal felt like a king about that time 

 and then to look back and see the mob tearing the gibbet to pieces and 
bearin splinter s away in their fingers that they might take em home to 
their families and brag of seein a man hung ho-hoo 

 that night t see d the poor devil s dead body cut and slashed on a dis- 
sectin table with old doctors prowlin about like wolves with bits o flesh 
between their fingers 

 one of em scraped his skull and cleaned it like a bowl an put it in a 
case with a label this is the skull of charles the pirate 

 hurray for the gallows say i it s only a kick an a jerk and a feller 
goes straight to kingdom come 

 the good old gallows law for ever and ever a-men 

 that s wot i calls a werry good story and major mulhill emitted a 
succession of smoke rings from his mouth bray-vo an allow me to 
tell you mister devil-bug that you ll have a pleasant opportunity o puttin it 
into practice yerself jist look at the crittur with his one eye and his bushy 
head wot a parfect fiend 

fitz-cowles half-raised his head from his manacled hands come here 
mulhill he said in a husky whisper i ve something to say to you 

easy larkspur strode toward the fire-place and in a moment seated by 
the side of fitz-cowles he was listening to the earnest whispers of the forger

proaching the side of luke harvey

 the main incidents of this episode are strictly true the hangman of course ia alone 
eaponsfble for the language and opinions of the story 



the hangman s glee 

luke s face was agitated by a strange and deep emotion that flashed from 
his eye and quivered in his nostrils 

 this way larkspur he cried beckoning to that worthy and leading 
tne way from the den into the dark hall of the mansion by the dim light 
which came from the roof far above the forms of some thirty men mana- 
cied and pinioned might be discovered thrown along the floor in various 
attitudes while the sound of shouts mingled with laughter came from the 
regions of the cellar 

 them is our wictims muttered larkspur as they stood in the gloom 
of the hall them shouts is from my beaks they re makin reether 
free with the likker i tell you 

 i wish to speak with you on a matter of deep interest said luke 
 this devil-bug here has in his keeping a secret of the utmost importance 
to myself arid livingstone that secret we can only obtain by his libera 
tion for the space of an hour

a special deppitty o the honorable ma or let a prisoner slip have you 
been indulgin in ardent sperrits or green peas young man 

 wonders how that ill vork ho ho hoo shouted a well-known voice 
from the door-keeper s den 

luke pushed open the door and beheld devil-bug standing in the middle 
of the room brandishing his freed arms over his head while he danced round 
the hand-cuffs laying on the floor 

 where s fitz-cowles you devil shrieked luke 

 escaped we found this feller s key on the floor ho ho hoo he

assumed an expression of the most painful grief oh my grasshus if i 
only had a small family of a wife and fifteen children to excite the symper- 
thies of the public for an unfort nate poleese deppitty 

tearing his hair in unfeigned anguish he rushed through the front door 
leaving devil-bug standing in the centre of the den while mother nancy and 
peggy grud sate against the wall yelling and swinging their bodies back 
wards and forwards to the same livel tune 

 now g-a-i to drag you from the wizard s den shrieked devil-bug 
tramping through the front door first i must get luke and then ho

as she spoke the room was filled by the band of police officers who had 
been hurried from their revel down stairs by the sounds of uproar in the 
door-keeper s den 



chapter fourth 

the chapel op jesus 

the oak chamber of hawkewood yet once again 

the lights on the round table are burning fast toward their sockets and 
the remains of the blazing wood fire smoulder away the ashes of the hearth 
the gold watch on the table tells the hour of eleven all is silent thro 
the chamber and thro the mansion silent and sad as the tomb 

who gazing around this chamber as it is now revealed in glimmering 
light might guess the nature of the awful tragedy enacted within its walls 
since yon watch marked the hour of six the chamber is the same as 
when livingstone and his wife first stepped over its threshhold the heavy 
curtains of the bed still droop from the canopy down to the floor in thick 
and purple folds the hangings of the windows toward the east turned part- 
ly aside still disclose the massive oaken frames the light still shines on the 
faded colors of the old-fashioned carpet and the dusky carvings of the 
wainscot still receive its genial glow the round table is still there and 
on either side are the gothic arm-chairs placed in the same position as 
they stood five hours ago the coffin and the corse is gone but amid the 
grey hickory ashes glitters a bright object like a piece of burnished silver 

all was deadly still through the mansion when the sound of a footstep 
vas heard from the main stairway it grew near and nearer until it echoed 
without the chamber door there was silence again for a moment and 
then the door flew open and a wild haggard figure advanced toward 
the light 

it was algernon fitz-cowles his black hair streaming back from his 
uncovered brow his dress torn and soiled with dust his bronzed face 
covered with thick perspiration while his dark eyes rolled to and fro with 
the glare of a bloodhound at bay he advanced toward the light and flung 
a glittering bowie-knife on the table 

if they want to trap the bloodhound they must fight for it he mut 
lered in tones hoarse with rage ha on the gulf of mexico in the 
streets of new orleans in the dens of charleston in the rookeries of mo 



the chapel of jesus 

bile there have been men who dared my hate and died yes like dogs 
with that knife in their hearts and shall i be trapped by a paltry counter- 
hopper a peddler of tapes and thimbles the son of old is not 

to be scared by such mean dogs 

 ha ha that was a gallant ride dim was faithful to me by 
the river passed two blood horses waited for me in the woods beyond 
camden now hey for hawkewood hurray says i feeling the old 
blood of the gulf in my veins once again not a hundred yards over 
the sandy road before my pursuers were at my heels mounted on good 
horses too but hurrah 

 over hill and thro hollow over brook and crag with their hootings 
giving fresh speed to my noble horses on on like a devil i flew one by 
one my pursuers drop one by one their horses fall hurrah by a lucky 
chance i find the way to hawkewood my horses are at the door and now 
for burlington dora promised to meet meat the door curse the thing 
why was she not there 

 lucky for me again the hall door was wide open i mount the stairs 
and here i am yes yes they must fight for it now for the search for 
dora ha livingstone s watch she must be in the house perchance 
in this very chamber 

he advanced to the bedside a gust of cold wind pouring thro the open 
door tossed the curls of his hair and extinguished the lights on the table 

 curse the thing muttered fitz-cowles the devil was in that wind 
how thick these curtains are he exclaimed tossing the dark purple 
ltblds aside 

 ha a woman s form by heaven it is dora 

all was dark within the bed but a faint gleam from the fireside revealed 
the form of a queenly woman half-concealed by the folds of the coverlid 

 dora dora softly murmured fitz-cowles bending over the bed 
 ha she is asleep her face is concealed by those dark curls let me 
sweep them gently aside dora awake it is the hour of our flight 
awake 

not a sound not a murmur he reached forth his hand and dashing 
the coverlid aside took her white hand within his own as he did this the 
withdrawn curtain swung slowly over him and gathered him within its folds 

 great god her hand is cold as ice he muttered as he stood in the 
same darkness that enveloped the bed dora awake phsaw how 
sound the woman sleeps know you not tis the hour of our flight rise 
dora and let us away 

sweeping the coverlid yet farther aside he placed his hand upon her bo 
som it was bare and cold as marble fitz-cowles could feel the clammy 
sweat starting from his brow while a horrible suspicion rushed like a thuu 
der-bolt upon his brain 



 the death-angels 

with one grasp he tcre the curtains from the bed he started back a step 
and a warm gleam from the fireside lit up the scene 

the form of dora livingstone cold and white as snow with every ves 
tige of apparel stript from its outlines of loveliness lay before him the 
dark hair fell around the pale face and the glassy eyes were upturned 
with a freezing stare 

 ha-h screamed fitz-cowles with an unearthly shriek the wo- 
man is dead dead 

a sudden glow from the fireside flashed over the livid face of fitz-cowles 
and over the form of the dead woman for a moment those round arms 
that bosom of swelling loveliness that face of thought linked with beauty 
and that form of peerless outlines rich waving and voluptuous looked like 
life and then all was death again 

fitz-cowles stood stricken dumb with unutterable horror even in his 
base heart there lurked a feeling like love for the woman who lay before him 

 the woman is dead he muttered and looked up vacantly he started 
back with a yell there there before him from the darkness on tho op- 
posite side of the bed like the vision of some fiend whom his words had 
raised from hell there gleamed two eyes flashing with unutterable lustre 
and there the livid outlines of a bronzed face stood out boldly in the fire 
side light 

 i am lost was the exclamation of the cowering wretch and ere the 
words died on his lips the tall form of livingstone was at his side 

 wretch he shrieked with his wide chest heaving and his muscular 
arms flung madly on high wretch behold your work this ruin of 
loveliness and innocence 

he pointed at the dead body and then with a howl like a tiger on the 
spring he rushed upon his victim 

 you must die he shrieked by the god above us you must die 

 stand back faltered fitz-cowles retreating towards the fireplace 
 do not lay your hands on me i am armed i am 

the words died on his lips livingstone s writhing fingers were round 
his throat livingstone s iron arm encircled his trembling frame he raised 
him in the air high over his head with all the force of his muscular arms 
gathered in the effort he swung the craven aloft and for a single moment 
held him quivering there his dark eye glaring on the hot coals and his 
bronzed face one terrible frown he dashed the forger to the floor not with 
the iron strength of his arms expended in the blow but with a contemptuous 
movement as though he but crushed the reptile that bit his heel 

 go he shouted in a voice of thunder go miscreant and swmd 
ier you are too mean a thing for my vengeance 

 but not for mine shouted a calm and determined voice striding for 
ward in the light villian you are my 

the bold words faltered on luke harvey s lips 



the chapel of jesus 

 dora he shrieked gazing on the dead hody as the jight from the 
fire flashed over its pale outlines there was a universe of horror lovo 
and revenge mingled in the emphasis with which he uttered that single 
word dora 

 come he fiercely shouted turning to fitz-cowles who leaned 
against the mantel this man has been wronged this woman murdered 
through your crimes i am the avenger of the wrong arid the murder 
come here are two pistols take your choice one of us must die 

ho ho hoo wot a pictur a dead oman and a crazy husband 
an my friends monk fitz-cowles an monk luke things does n t secrn 
to work right 

his upraised hand holding a light above his head devil-bug stood in the 
doorway every feature of his face distorted by a sneering grimace and his 
solitary eye full of malignant fire 

 come shouted luke motioning fitz-cowles toward the door 

 i will fight you muttered fitz-cowles with a look of fiendish hate 
 aye if it is over a table with but an arm s length between us 

devil-bug led the way toward the landing fitz-cowles followed luke 
alone remained on the threshhotd he cast one last look into the chamber 

 luke luke shouted a well-known voice one year ago she crossed 
my threshhold a fair young bride and now oh god 

luke beheld the form of livingstone kneeling beside the dead body of 
his wife 

come he shouted leading the way down the stairway it required 
but a few moments for the three to traverse the entire length of the corridor 
on the second floor which extended thro half the length of the mansion 
toward the south devil-bug led the way holding the light overhead and 
at his back in grim silence followed luke and fitz-cowles 

they passed the doors of many rooms but did not pause until the cor- 
idor was terminated by a wide oaken door that occupied its entire width 

 here is the scene of my sacrifice said luke pushing open the door 
with his foot little did i ever think when i used to roam these halls 
many a day gone by that the chapel of hawkewood would ever be polluted 
by the blood of a coward and a forger 

 coward in your teeth shouted fitz-cowles hoarse with rage you 
shau pay for this insolence with your blood 

 devil-bug said luke with a calmness of voice that was evidently 
assumed watch without this door watch i say until this affair is 
finished when one of us appears at this door with the dead body of the 
other in his arms let that man pass but until one is dead let neither of 
us pass from this door bury the dead man in the vaults of hawkewood 
and keep the secret of his death you are a desperate man devil-bug 
and i can trust you with this matter you swear to do as i command 

 i do answered devil-bug with a hideous grin hurray with the fun 

taking the light frcnn devil-bug luke led the way into the chapel of 



 the death-angels 

hawkewood followed by fitz cowles the door closed behind them at 
they entered the place whose walls would witness a scene of bloodshed 
and death 

it was a long and narrow room with an oaken floor and an arching 
ceiling not a solitary window gave light to the place and the only en 
trance was the door through which they had passed which opened into the 
centre of the room the southern end of the room was concealed by a 
large picture which reached from wall to wall and from the ceiling to the 
floor in front of this picture arose a piece of carved statuary painted to 
represent the hues of life and agony and some few paces in front of the 
image was a small square table covered with a mouldering white cloth 
on the picture was delineated the virgin mary and her holy child the sta 
tue was an image of the expiring redeemer stretched on the cross in all 
the agonies of superhuman suffering yet with a godlike triumph breaking 
over his brow the table covered with white cloth was the altar of 
god on which the vessels of the holy sacrament had lain in many a solemn 
hour while the tears of remorse and anguish sprinkled the oaken floor 

and those hard planks around the altar in more places than one were 
worn into deep hollows here had lord walter longford the first propri 
etor of hawkewood knelt during the still watches of night groaning in 
agony as he thought of the dishonor of his house 

 e will fig nt ver this altar said luke as he moved the table 
nearer the centre of the room it is but just that wrongs such as i 
have to avenge should be avenged over the altar of god in sight of his 
cross 

the light was on the altar and luke stood with his back to the cross 
his tall form towering in all its heighth as with the pistol in his hand he 
gazed fiercely in the face of fitz-cowles 

 monk luke sneered the forger taking his place on the opposite side 
 you deserve your title but enough of this trifling i am waiting to 
chastise your impertinence what shall be our signal 

luke silently took a letter from his pocket and tore a narrow slip of 
paper from the outside then creasing this piece of paper with his finger 
he poured some few grains of powder into the hollow thus made from 
a flask which he drew from his coat pocket he rolled the paper in 
his hand until it enveloped the powder and advancing to the altar wound 
it around the wick of the candle between the flame and the hollow which 
it had burned in the wax 

 when the candle burns down to that paper ana fires the powder then 
let each man take care of his life 

 agreed muttered fitz-cowles examining the percussion cap of his 

jistol when the paper and the powder blazes then by i ll fire v 

for a single moment the antagonists contemplated each other there 

were but five paces between them fitz-covvles was lividly pale but a 

jleam of ferocity stamped his craven face while from every line of luke s 






the chapel of jesus 

countenance from his compressed lip and clear dark eye there spoke the 
same holy resolution he stood there in that chapel as the avenger of 
wrong raw murder 

lower and lower burned the candle until the flame touched the paper 
which enveloped the powder a start quivered through fitz-cowles frame 
but luke s firm fingers clenched his pistol with an iron grasp 

 in a moment i may be in hell muttered fitz-cowles 

think of the dead body of your victin think of dora shrieked luke 
and the powder blazed up around the candle-wick 

there was a report two pistols mingled their sounds together and white 
columns of smoke rolled upward to the ceiling when that smoke cleared 
away each antagonist beheld his foe standing unharmed unhurt on the 
opposite side of the altar luke s ball had grazed fitz-cowles shoulder 
and sunk in the wall behind the shot of the forger had whistled by har 
vey s right temple and splintered the face of the image at his back 

 wonders how that ill work roared a hoarse voice without the door 

 now fool and coward you have spent your shot muttered fitz- 
cowles drawing a bowie knife from his bosom and rushing toward the 
altar you have defied a man who never yet failed with this good knife 

his face darkened by the conflict of hideous passions fitz-cowles rushed 
past the altar with his brandished knife gleaming in the light luke stood 
calm and firm with a quiet smile playing round his thin lips was he re 
signed for his death fitz-cowles prided himself on his skill with the 
bowie knife as a butcher loves to boast of his dexterity in slaughtering an 
ox he could cut and thrust and parry and stab and strike and maim 
a brave man was fitz-cowles 

two paces lay between the bravo and luke harvey 

 aye dog i have you shouted fitz-cowles with a brutal sneer 

luke slowly raised his right arm with the pistol in his clenched hand 

 these pistols are double-barreled he coolly said one of them is 
loaded in both barrels you have thrown away yours i am sorry for 
you you took your choice of the pistols awhile ago now take your 
chance from this barrel perhaps it s loaded perhaps it is n t let this 
decide 

fitz-cowles recoiled with one sudden movement toward the altar luke 
drew the trigger there was a stunning report and all was darkness the 
ball had extinguished he candle 

a horrid oath resounded through the darkness you dog i have you 
at last spoke the hoarse voice of fitz-cowles and then there was the 
sound of a hurried footstep followed by a sudden crash all was still aye 
still as the corse beneath the coffin-lid luke could hear his own hard 
breathing it was the only sound that disturbed the silence of the place 
he could not see his hand before his eyes the chapel seemed suddenly 
filled with a darkness that was thick dense and almost tangible 






 the death-angels 

where was fitz- bowles luke felt a shudder creep over hs frame as 
he fancied the bravo slowly dragging his form snake-like along the flooi 
in order to hew his victim down by one sudden and unseen blow was he 
urking beside the altar luke listened the stillness of the place was in- 
lense and horrible 

in silence and with softened footsteps luke receded backward until his 
extended hands touched a cold and inanimate object it was the image of 
the dying saviour gliding behind the cross luke crouched down and 
jnarmed as he was listened for the approach of the bravo not a footstep 
nor a voice was heard not even the sound of half-suppressed breathing 

could his last ball have taken effect might not the oath and threat with 
which fitz-cowles sprang forward been his last that crash was the sound 
of his dead body falling to the floor in the agonies of death 

 i will creep forward on my hands and knees and satisfy myself by 
he touch of his dead body 

and on and on and around and around he crept ever searching for the 
altar and yet still as far from the object of his search after a lapse of half 
an hour as when he first began have you ever found yourself late at night 
in a dark room hunting for a door with whose position you were familiar 
and which still for long hours eluded your search so luke harvey creep 
ing over the floor of the dark chapel sought for the altar beside which he 
expected to find the dead body of his antagonist and yet by some strange 
chance or other he always found himself against the bare walls or at the 
foot of the cross or groping along the canvass of the picture which occupied 
one end of the room 

a strange awe began to seize his soul he sat down with his head be 
tween his knees listening for the faintest echo of a sound and at last fell 
into a wild half-waking sleep from which he was soon aroused by a roaring 
noise that filled his ears like the thunder of a mighty river breaking its way 
through a deep glen where opposing mountains meet 

it may have been a few minutes or half an hour since luke had entered 
the chapel but his strange bewilderment in the darkness and silence had 
confused his idea of time and he rose on his feet like a man struggling with 
some hideous night-mare 

that awful roaring grew nearer and louder and more distinct now it yel 
led without the very chapel walls and sudden as a flash from the cannons 
mouth the darkness passed away one entire end of the chapel was a wall 
of flame through the canvass on which was delineated the blessed mother 
and the holy child long tongues of forked fire were thrust blazing into the 
place and the dim colors glared in horrid light another instant and the 
whole extent of the chapel every nook and corner the altar and the cross 
the ceiling and the walls were all laid bare by a sheet of streaming flame 

from the centre of the floor right at the altar s foot uprose a grim and 
hideous head with long locks of elf-like hair waving in the red light and a 



the chapel of jesus 

distorted face grinning like a death s-head fired by the glare of a rolling 
eye that blazexl like a coal from hot ashes slowly it uprose it mocked 
the eyes of the gazer with a loathsome grimace like the grin of a mocking 
devil and then a discordant laugh yelled through the fiery air 

we now return to devil-bug whom we left watching beside the chapel 
door the sound of the first fire had thundered on his ear and uprising 
from his crouching position he ran along the corridor passed down the stair 
way and through the dim hall laughing merrily to himself all the while 

the hall door was wide open but all was silent throughout the mansion 

devil-bug passed the doorway and presently found himself among the 
deserted garden walks where winter had colored all objects with a hue of 
dead monotonous brown while statutes thrown down from their pedestals 
and arbors crumbling to ruin attested the decay into which hawkewood 
had fallen during the life of albert livingstone through the dark pines 
which were scattered all around the mansion devil-bug wandered listlessly 
on until he stood beneath the shadow of the southern wing where one bold 
mass of sombre grey stone projecting from the body of the edifice was dimly 
disclosed by the starlight in vague yet ponderous outlines from the earth 
on which devil-bug stood to the conical roof which surmounted this depen 
dency of the main edifice the uniformity of its dark grey stone was only 
broken by a solitary door opening into the garden 

that must be the chapel exclaimed devil-bug and in the second 
story them fellers is fightin like devils ho hoo wonders how that ill 
work 

passing round the mansion devil-bug stood on the summit of a hill in its 
rear which affording room for a broad walk between the edifice and its brow 
sank suddenly into the glen below where a faint gurgling sound like the 
echo of a brook choked up by weeds and withered leaves broke on the silent 
air the pine trees on this side of the mansion were shrunken blasted and 
withered through their white branches rising coldly in the air the star 
light fell brightly over the grey walls of the lordly structure devil-bug s 
heavy footsteps were echoed by the crashing of the withered leaves which 
were gathered ankle-deep around the trunks of the blasted trees striking 
into a rude path which descended into the darkness of the glen devil-bug 
went slowly down looking around upon the white trunks rising like ghosts 
on every side with a feeling of strange awe 

a wild fancy seized this strange monster he had drawn forth a cigar and 
having lighted it with the sparks from a steel and flint falling on a piece of 
decayed wood which soon presented a small yet substantial mass of fire he 
knelt on the hard ground while his hideous face was encircled in wreaths 
of tobacco smoke gathering the dry leaves into a heap around the crumb 
mng trunk the remnant of a fallen tree devil-bug added brushwood and 
broken limbs to the pile and then chuckled grimly at his work 



 the death-angels 

 it s cold as thunder he exclaimed indulging in a lively sinulie ana 
i ll have a bit of fire 

he applied the burning wood to the trunk of the tree in a moment it took 
fire and ere devil-bug rose on his feet the dry leaves were in a blaze 

the monster then leaped merrily up and down executing a devil s dance 
in the light of the flame 

 ho-hoo he shouted while every lineament of his face every point of 
his figure was changed to vivid crimson ho-hoo there they are 
there there the man with the broken jaw the ooman with the holler 
skull there there a-layin longside the fire warmin their cussed bones 
uh-oo-hoo 

as his wild shriek of unearthly laughter was borne away by the wind 
the flame crept up the limbs of a withered tree winding like a fiery serpent 
around each decayed branch until a long column of fire and smoke shot 
away into the dark blue sky there was a howling gust of wind sweeping 
down into the glen and from tree to tree like a thing of life the fire leapt 
and gathered leaves branches and dry limbs into its fierce embrace 

in a few moments devil-bug was surrounded by a sheet of flame 
with a wild howl half delight half terror he rushed along the rude path 
he gained the summit of the hill and looked at the fruits of his labor 
to the eastward of the mansion far down into the glen the whole wood 
was one mass of fire above the sky was bloody red beneath were whirl 
ing waves of smoke through which the forked flames writhed like awful 
serpents of the air whom some wierd spell had rendered visible to human 
eye withered tree reached forth its fiery arms to withered tree the fires 
sent up their flaming crests to the lurid heavens and then a mighty roar as 
cended on the still air like the shriek of pharoah s host beneath the waters 
of the sea 

with every infernal emotion playing over his chaos of a face mingled 
with some gleams of human feeling for the space of fifteen minutes danc 
ing hooting yelling or standing like a block of stone with his arms folded 
over his breast devil-bug watched the progress of the fire 

the whole eastern woods were now one wall of living flame the win 
ter wind rushing toward the east for a few brief moments bore the mass 
of fire in rolling waves away toward the horizon of the rising sun 

waves of flame and clouds of smoke the blue sky above turned to burn 
ing red and the earth beneath changed suddenly into an ocean of fire ho 
ho this was a sight for devil -bug to gaze upon in maniac glee 

suddenly the wind shifted and the whole sea of flame rushed with a 
roar like hell upon the roofs of the doomed mansion 

in an instant the roof was wrapped in a sheet of flame into the win- 
dows it rushed along the eves it poured it whirled round the steep gables 
the mansion seemed an altar of molten flame 

 must save that feller luke i must save him for the sake o th gal 



the chapel of jesus 

creeched devil-bug hello there s a window in the east o that 
chapel the fire nears it quick quick old boy or all is lost 

half-stifled by clouds of smoke devil-bug ran round to the western front 
of the mansion at his back roared and whirled the sea of flame over 
his head it tossed in burning waves 

with one glance he saw that all hope of entrance by the hall-door was 
vain he looked to the door of the southern wing to his astonishment he 
found its huge panels laid prostrate at his feet 

it was no time for thought rushing through the arching doorway 
devil-bug by the light of a sudden flash of flame beheld the massive walls 
of a grave-vault with three coffins placed at regular intervals on solid blocks 
of stone he saw these coffins and a cloud of smoke wrapt the place in 
darkness another flash of flame and in the centre of the vault rising 
from the stone floor to the arching ceiling he beheld the outlines of a rude 
ladder placed in the aperture of a small trap-door 

 hello f here s fun for an old boy like me i one o them fellers has 
killed th tother in the chapel up stairs and the door bein locked he s got 
off by this trap-door and ladder ho hoo i must satisfy my mind if 
luke s killed all s up with the g-al fire away curse you and smoke 
away who keers 

he rushed toward the ladder he ascended its rounds and in a moment 
passing through the narrow trap-door his sight was blinded by one quiver 
ing sheet of flame the hot fire smote his brain with a pang like death 
he yelled in agony and then a wild shriek of infernal laughter burst from 
his lips he beheld the picture tossed in fragments on the sheets of flame 
he beheld the image of jesus turned to dazzling crimson by the blinding 
light he saw the figure crouching at the foot of the cross 

luke he shrieked rushing forward save yerself there s hell 
around us above us below us hurr-a-h this is wot i likes but come 
my feller save yerself for the sake o the gal 

 the key shouted luke springing on his feet and pointing to the door 

 this way exclaimed devil-bug thro that trap-door down th 
ladder hurray 

the key thundered luke with fierce gesture the key quick 
i say 

 take it and to the devil with you screamed devil-bug flinging the 
key at luke s feet 

as though his soul hung on that instant s deeds luke seized the key 
unlocked the door and his form was lost in a cloud of smoke that filled 
the chapel 

 ven he gits in the middle o th fire and can t breathe ho ho 
wonders how that ill vork and with a wild laugh devil-bug retreated 
to the trap-door 

the lonely corridor yet free from flame but obscured by smoke re- 



 the deatk-angels 

echoed to luke harvey s footsteps his heart was in his throat as hfl 
darted onward in an instant the stairs were gained thank god they 
were free from the lurid flame or stifling smoke with one bound luke 
rushed up the steps of massive oak he stood on the landing in front of the 
oak chamber at that very instant the glass of the eastern window fell 
crashing at his feet he was surrounded by a cloud of black and choking 
smoke stifled by the heat he leaned against one of the posts of the oak 
chamber door and a sudden gust of wind bore smoke and flame out through 
the window in the fiery air once more 

luke gazed into the oak chamber one wild and horror stricken look 
and all was smoke and flame again 

that gaze that look of a moment great god let its horror never be 
told to living man accursed be the lips that murmur it accursed the pen 
that pictures it luke gave one look and a mass of flame rose up between 
him and the horrid vision he gave one look and his heart died within him 

let us pray to heaven that what he then beheld was only a fearful dream 
engendered by the smoke and heat 

that arm uplifted that frown that kneeling form that tide of gushing 

blood hush never never to human ears may that sight be tcld i 

was a dream yes yes only a dream but that scream that shriek gurg 
ling from the smoke and flame did ever human thing ridden by the horror 
of madness fancy a shriek like that 

only one look and yet to see a sight which it were blasphemy to tell 
only one look and yet to have one s heart forever blasted by its rwomory 

pursued by smoke and flame luke rushed down the stairway over cracl 
ling timbers and through waves of fire he gained the hall door as thougi 
a fiend was at his shoulder flinging his arms aloft he rushed through the 
grove of burning pines toward the mansion gate 

three human figures stood on the rising knoll an gtid man and withered 
woman but half sheltered from the night by their scanty apparel and there 
holding the reins of two plunging horses in his iron hands a grim monster 
stood at their backs 

with a face like ashes luke sprang upon his horse not a word passed 
from his lips but casting one vacant glance at the sea of flame roaring 
around the doomed house he dashed down the road with the speed of wind 

not once did he look back until five miles lay between him and the roofs 
of hawkewood from the summ of a gentle hill he gazed backward upon 
scene and as he gazed the forrr of devil-bug clinging like a toad to the 
neck of a foaming steed was at his side 

 ho hoo you re a purty feller to leave an old man and oo man to be 
burnt up ain t you now if it had nt been for me they d a-been roasted 
sartin as hell is blazin yonder ho hoo i does wonder how that ill 
vork 

he pointed to the world of flame and his screech-owl laugh broke like 
gend s yell on the air 



the chapel of jesus 

it was an awful sight awful and sublime as tho the book of revelation 
had started into action the entire eastern horizon was one wall of flame 
dark purple and bright red and dazzling crimson mingled together with a 
chaos of smoke rolling up to the sky in awful folds pile on pile to the very 
zenith 

chasm and plain orchard and farm-house ravine and dell lay bared tc 
the eye in a blaze brighter than the noon-day sun then the roar of the 
fiames x like the groan of millions or the last convulsive throw of an expiring 
world how it swelled in awful volume how it shrieked through mountains 
of smoke how it filled all space 

i i have stood in the streets of the quaker city while a fierce mob hungry 
for blood howled onward their ten thousand faces glaring in the light of a 
burning church whose dome went up to heaven in clouds of smoke and 
waves of fire i have heard their yell of mocking triumph as the cross of 
jesus tottered from its proud height quivered for a moment and then fell 
plunging into the abyss of flame 

but here was neither church ffbr cross nor frenzied mob all was soli 
tary desolation not a breath of fanaticism to fan the flame nor yet the 
visage of a grim bigot grinning at the work of ruin 

all was fire and smoke and solitude far over the land far along the 
wide horizon the forests lapped in sheets of fire sent their greeting to the 
sky as though they yelled in triumph beneath the wild career of desolation 

 never never never muttered luke in a tone of whispered horror 
 never to be spoken by human lips to human ears only one look and 
yet that sight oh god tear it from my soul tear it from my heart this 
awful memory better to die stretched on the rope of a gibbet than to hava 
this phantom ever brooding over my soul that frown that uplifted hand 
that kneeling form never never never to living man shall it be spoken 

he dashed the spurs in the flanks of his steed and without once looking 
back on the sea of flame sped madly onward while the distorted form of 
devil-bug rode at his horse s heels like some laughing demon in pursuit of 
his victim 



chapter fifth 

the temple of ravoni 

white columns of incense rolled in soft and curling folds through the 
temple to the arching dome from whose azure expanse innumerable lights 
glittered like stars in a clear sky the sound of a low-toned and absorbing 
music floated through the smoke of the incense and the breath of flowers 
filled the air through the intervals of fhe snowy columns filling that wide 

temple with shapes of fantastic splendor you might see the forms of beau- 

 



 the death an gels 

tiftil women moving in a gliding dance their limbs encircled by a light and 
flowing drapery 

then a wilderness of flowers sweet as may or gorgeous as autumn broke 
on your eye with here and there a fountain of clear water rising in the 
light and sprinkling its spray drops in the air with a murmur of rippling 
music then the columns of incense closed upon the vision of flowers and 
fountain veiling the forms of beautiful women in its robes of snowy white 
ness while the light from the azure dome gave a thousand hues a thousand 
fairy shapes to the wreaths of fragrant mist as they swept through the 
temple or broke among the pillars or rolled away to the arching roof 

from the bosom of those snowy clouds come the sound of women s feet 
sweeping over the floor to a low and soft-toned measure while the murmur 
of fountains mingled with the harp and viol and the air grew heavy with 
he perfumes of incense overpowering for a moment the fragrance of innu 
merable flowers 

suddenly the columns of smoke died away and a scene like some 
dream of enchantment was laid bare to the eye 

in the centre of the place around an altar of snow-white marble were 
grouped a crowd of maidens whose beauty was like the blushing dawn or 
solemn eve on still midnight various contrasted and enchanting between 
this crowd of beauty and the altar knelt some twenty-four young men 
whose thoughtful faces and flashing eyes were in vivid constraint with the 
jong white robes that fell round their well-proportioned forms on the 
other side of the altar with a beautiful maiden by his side stood a man of 
strange beauty his light yet muscular form clad in a tunic of black velvet 
reaching to his knees while from the floor some few faces at his back 
arose a tent with white silken curtains waving to and fro in the dazzling 
light of the dome 

around the scene the strange man and the maiden the cluster of kneel 
ing men and the group of beautiful women swept the twelve marble pillars 
of the temple describing th circular form of the place and supporting the 
roof of the white dome from whose azure expanse twinkled and fell the 
glare of innumerable lights 

twelve massive pillars of dark-hued marble rose from the variegated floor 
to the dome above and around each pillar were clustered vases of solid 
stone filled with rare and beautiful flowers mingling their hues and per 
fume while they rustled gently in the light here was the rose from the 
vales of persia the lily from the clear waters of some ethiopian lake the 
gorgeous flower of montezuma from the wilds of mexican deserts here 
too from amid rich green leaves the hue and shape of luscious fruit were 
thrust into light the golden orange and the yellow lime the purple grape 
hanging in clusters and the blushing peach bending beneath the weight of 
its own ripeness fruits and flowers of every clime ripened and bloomed 
around the massive pillars of that gorgeous temple

the temple of ravoni 

beyond these pillars was a cloistered space but dimly penetrated by tht 
ight yet full of music and beauty in the interval between each pillar 
arose a gentle fountain of clear water darting upward through the dim air 
and falling into a basin of snow-white marble with an almost inaudible 
murmur twelve fountains showering into the dim air that lay beyond the 
pillars mingled their murmurs and filled the temple with a soft and lulling 
melody like the hum of bees revelling amid the perfume of intoxicating 
flowers and the song of birds faint and chirping or rich full and gush 
ing came from the dimness of the cloister blendingwith the murmur of the 
fountains or rising in distinct melody to the echoing dome 

his dark hair falling to his shoulders his brow glowing with a strange 
joy his olive cheek flushed with the hues of immortal youth ravoni stood 
between the silken tent and the altar looking with the same expression of 
triumph on the young face of the maiden by his side the kneeling enthu 
siasts extending along the floor and the forms of the lovely women cluster 
ing around in attitudes of grace and beauty 

well might ravoni gaze upon these beaming faces and graceful forms 
with his dark eye dilating with mingled triumph and admiration here 
were the beauties of the world called from cottage harem and hall that 
maiden yonder whose supple form is clad in light drapery reaching to her 
knees whose dark brown cheek blushes with the ripeness of her native 
skies whose raven hair is tinged with a shade of glossy blue whose lips 
are luscious red need you ask the name of the land from which this blos 
som sprung a child of fair skies and sunny waters a child of deep 
groves fragrant with tropical fruits a daughter of hindoostan whom ravoni s 
hand sixteen years ago rescued from the waters of the ganges while the 
animal mother the murderer of her infant stood looking on with a smile 

that queenly woman with the tall form the fair skin the dark eyes and 
the rich brown hair the child of old virginia entrusted by rich parents 
to the care of doctor ravoni by her side that sweet young girl with a 
form so fragile and yet so beautiful with a vacant blue eye and sunny 
clusters of golden hair falling over a neck like a snow-flake the warm 
skies of carolina laugh in her eye and in her smile here in fine are 
shapes from all the world shapes of living breathing beaming loveliness 
the creole from new orleans with limbs of voluptuous softness an eye 
so dark so melting so full of passion revenge and madness the mild 
beauty of the british isle with a skin like snow warmed with a flush of 
daybreak the warm maiden of spain with her olive cheek and flashing 
eye the faultless forms of many a grecian isle and the heaving bosoms 
of circassia the cherry lips of pennsylvania and the blue eyes and sunny 
locks of germany these all were mingled in that crowd of loveliness and 
beauty 

well might the smile of triumph wreathe the dark red lip of ravoni 
there amid this cluster of lovely women were the daughters of rich and 



 the death-angels 

haughty families whose broad lands lay in the far scattered states of th 
american union whose magnificent mansions lined the streets of many a 
town and city in north and south and west in the peopled centre and 
on the forest borders they had been sent to the mad-doctor ravoni 
whose reputation for skill in all cases of insanity was without a parallel 

here they were grouped around the altar of ravoni mingled among the 
forms of his harem alike the dupes of his will and instruments of his pow 
er here they were the willing slaves of his magnetic glance but ere you 
drop a tear for the fate of these patients of the mad-doctor let me raise up 
before your eyes the shadow of a horrid wrong which is done every day 
in this good quaker city and every hour in the day under the solemn 
sanction of the law 

me point your vision to the grim cells of that legal mad-house 
a reckless charlaton administers his brutal rule in damp cells lit 
tered by straw amid the glorious panoply of chains and bolts and iars 
let me picture to you this pitiless quack standing lash in hand ovei the 
prostrate body of some insane wretch while his band of brutal ruffians 
stand ready to do his will even though that will be slow and deliberate murder 
when you have taken in the full details of the picture when you have im 
pressed on your mind the fact that this quack and his mad-house are both 
the creatures of your statute-books that sane men have been dragged into 
their clutches by designing relatives and kept chained and lashed until 
insanity came to their relief followed by sudden death then quarrel 
with the mad-house of the sorcerer even now as i write there rises be 
fore me the records of a judicial investigation which gave to this lega 
mad-house all the horrors of the bastile in its most gory hour 

the dark eyes of ravoni were fixed upon the face of the maiden who 
stood by his side it was a pale face aye pale and white as snow yet full 
of health and beaming with a strange life in thick masses her raven-black 
hair streamed over her shoulders while her dark eyes had but one look 
one gaze and that was centred upon the face of ravoni 

 here amid the breath of flowers the lull of fountains and the song of 
birds do i consecrate the priestess of our new faith on this white brow 
i place the crown of flowers may thy soul fair maiden be pure for ever 
more pure and stainless as these lilies thy heart young and warm forever 
as these buds of the opening rose arise and hail the virgin izole arise 
and hail the priestess of our new faith 

slowly the enthusiasts arose but not a murmur passed from their parted 
lips izole stood before them like a thing of air so pure so fair and so 
serenely beautiful each dark eye was fixed upon her in a look of rever 
ence like religious worship 

ravoni waved his hand and the crowd of beautiful women went whirl 
ing over the floor while the sound of the harp and viol arose merrily on th 



the temple of ravoni 

air the murmur of fountains and the song of birds was mingled with the 
hght tripping sound of women s feet while the light from the dome shone 
over a scene of bewitching fascination now circling in groups of two and 
three their bounding limbs stirring the light drapery which but faintly 
veiled the glory of each shape the beauty of each heaving bosom or again 
sweeping round the altar and the tent in one breathing mass of loveliness 
each fair arm raised gently in the light while they glided over the floor 
their forms undulating to the impulse of soft and murmuring music the 
were worthy of moslem s heaven these women of ravoni 

 these are the forms of sense and passion exclaimed ravoni they - 
speak not but as i will they have no soul but mine this and his 
dark eye was centred on the face of izole this is a form of pure and 
spiritual loveliness in this sweet form in this mild face beaming such un 
utterable love behold the incarnation of our faith 

not a word from the disciples not a murmur from izole they had but 
one eye and that was centred on her face her dark eyes had but one glance 
and that was chained to the flashing eyes of ravoni 

 from time to time through every age and in every clime there have 
appeared on the earth fair maidens whose delicate organization warming 
with life yet full of spiritual beauty indicates their holy mission they en 
dure persecution they suffer wrong their childhood is one bitter pang 
friendless and alone they walk the earth while their souls art in the fu 
ture while their thoughts dwell with indefinable longing on the hope of another 
world hidden in the bosom of space these are the chosen of god it is 
unto such as these that the awful supreme gently manifests his will 
look my children around you cluster fair and beautiful women the light 
from yon dome falls on heaving bosoms and glowing cheeks are these 
the chosen of god never creatures of sense their animal organization 
reveals their nature but this fair creature standing by my side this image 
of pure thought whose dark eyes i now hold exchained with my glance 
tell me is she not the chosen of the eternal as i speak behold her eyes 
fire with prophecy her lips part in wonder as the prospect of the future 
rushes on her soul 

the twenty-four believers in the new faith knelt down in silence group 
ing around them in attitudes of voluptuous grace were the beauties of all the 
world their vacant eyes fixed in wonder on the face of ravoni the lull of 
fountains the murmur of birds the perfume of flowers these all were in the air 

what see st thou spoke the deep voice of ravoni and his dark eye 
shot a fixed gleam into the eyes of the priestess 

her form dilated her right hand rose gently overhead her lips parted and 
with her dark eyes filled with wonder and awe izole gazed on the vacant air 

 i am in a large city whose domes arise into the blue sky the streets 
are filled with free and happy people thre are no rich there are no poor 
i see neither cliurch nor gaol priest noi gaoler yet yet all are hapvy i 



 the death- an gels 

 this is our faith no rich no poor no priests no gaolers look 
again izol what see st thou 

 a man has dyed his hands in murder his victim lays at his feet and 
the crowd circle round with pale faces hark they whisper and point to 
the date on yonder edifice the two- hundredth year of the independence 
of man s soul since then they whisper there have been but two mur 
der s in our land murder to them is no familiar thing 

 do they drag the murderer to the gallows or to the solitary cell where 
madnes-s digs its fangs into the victim s soul 

 there are neither gaol nor gibbet in the land hush hear you that 
cry of madness he begs them to slay him he cries for the mercy of the 
sword of gibbet in that city of happy people he feels himself accursed 
he rises none lifts a hand to molest him he shrieks the face of his dead 
victim haunts him like a curse he goes to his home his friends and 
neighbors gather round him they seek to comfort him hark that voice 
crime is a disease to be cured not an ulcer to be cut off 

 see st thou no place of worship where prayers are made to the eternal 
god 

 come come with a gentle footstep come cross we this peaceful 
threshold a father a wife and little children they sit in their own 
home with the free air blowing through the windows and god s sun shining 
in their faces here is their place of worship home j 

 and from whence comes this peace this mercy this religion of home 

 lo we are in the streets again two citizens meet in the pathway 
they greet each other with familiar salutations but that silent grasp of each 
others hand that mystic sign made by each upon his forehead what 
means that grasp that sign they are brothers of the secret order of ra- 
v voni established two hundred years ago the very existence of this band 
is deemed a fable by the mass of men but in silence and in secrecy by the 
children of the faith has this great peace and mercy and this religion of 
home been brought to light 

 this faith what is it i 

 hope to man exclaimed the priestess as her hand rose in the air and 
her dark eye flashed with thoughts of unutterable meaning 

 hail ravoni we love thy faith we are brothers of thy order it iis a 
prophecy hail ravoni hail we worship thee w 

with a murmur of awe the disciples of ravoni rose from the floor they 
encircled the altar the master and the maiden and stood with uplifted hands 
while the crowd of beautiful women whirled dancing around the scene and 
the lull of fountains and the song of birds mingled with the cry hail ra- 
voni we worship thee 

the sorcerer turned from the band of enthusiasts and tossed aside the 
hangings of the silken tent which arose in the full light of the dome 

 behold the arisen dead he exclaimed while a murmur of surprise 



the temple of ravoni 

pread through the group fair and beautiful as some dream which comes 
over the half-waking soul in the voluptuous softness of a summer s sunset 
a maiden form lay reclining on a couch of light crimson velvet her white 
robes displaying in easy folds the womanly symmetry of her shape her 
glowing cheek rested on her full round arm while the hand lay softly on her 
bosom rising and falling with the gentle impulse of slumber the hair 
which fell in flowing masses around her face was bright silken and glossy 
like the hue of sun-beams bathing the crest of a rippling billow 

 she has arisen from death but she still lingers in a state of trance said 
ravoni passing his hand gently along her forehead while his dark eyes 
flashed with light like a living flame arise maiden arise arise and 
speak to the children of the faith the revelations made to thee while thy soul 
freed from the body soared in the realms of trance 

the maiden slowly unclosed her eyes of a light and liquid azure the dis 
ciples clustered closer around the altar waiting the anticipated revelation 
with interest and awe while ravoni stood gazing upon the countenance of 
the light-haired girl with an expression that indicated his powerful will con 
centred jn a single object with deep and absorbing intensity 

 speak maiden said ravoni in his voice of low-toned music 

the murmur on the lips of the girl mingled with the sound of footsteps 
resounding from either side of the temple with one start the disciples of 
ravoni and the crowd of beautiful women turned their gaze from side to 
sidej while the forms of the intruders advanced into the glare of the light 

i annie j shrieked a voice hoarse with emotion and a young mam 
whose long dark hair fell waving aside from a pale face stamped with the 
traces of an agony like madness came rushing from the cloister with wild 
and unsteady footsteps 

the maiden reclining within the folds of the tent beheld him she rose 
from the couch with a faint murmur and as he rushed forward through 
the group of enthusiasts she raised her arms aloft and sunk senseless into 
his embrace 

 ha our young enthusiast hath arisen from his slumber muttered 
ravoni as he gazed upon the face of byrne wood arlington but lover 
and maiden both shall minister to my will 

as he spoke the dome was filled with a sound like the howl of an enraged 
hyena every eye was turned toward the opposite side of the temple and 
the light fell upon a deformed shape rushing wildly over the floor with 
head half-sunken between the shoulders and long arms with fingers like 
talons fiung quivering in the air that face with the wide mouth the teeth 
fixedly compressed the eyeless socket and the blazing eye ravoni knew 
it well and knew that now was the time for the exertion of his utmost 
power 

 the gal shrieked the voice of devil-bug as he strode rapidlv to 
ard the altar wizard give me that gal or or 



 the death-angels 

his teeth churned with rage and the white foam hung rouna his hug 
lips he stood with heavy chest and a burning eye gazing steadily in the 
face of ravoni the same start of fear quivered through the disciples and 
the women of ravoni with one impulse they recoiled from the altar 
leaving the master sorcerer to confront the monster who stood before him 

gently gathering his arm around the waist of izole the priestess and the 
maiden ravoni fixed the glance of his dark eye upon the face of devil-bug 
the savage looked from one to the other first on the pale face of izole 
then in dark the countenance of the sorcerer he raised his arms aloft with a 
cry of vengeance he sprung forward a murmur of horror escaped from 
the lips of the disciples devil-bug sprung forward his hands quivering 
and his eye flashing but the calm dark eye of ravoni was fixed upon him 
he made an effort to overcome the witcjomhat burning glance he 
clutched his brawny chest with his talon fingers and then fell back recoiling 
 on one knee 

 gi me the gal wizard only gi me the gal he moaned looking upward 
with a subdued and pitiful glance gi me the gal an i ll be your slave 
i ll murder stab and burn for yo i ll be yer slave for life i ll i ll only 
gi rne the gal wizard 

 slave the sneer quivered on the thin lips of ravoni know you 
that the man who treads this floor unbidden has doomed himself to death 
begone or from this temple walls you will never pass again but as a corse 

 imposter shouted a sneering voice at the back of devil-bug jug 
gler and knave resign this girl to me or i will teach you the wholesome 
discipline which judge lynch awards to strolling vagabonds 

ravoni raised his glance and beheld the tall form of luke harvey 
standing at the back of devil-bug his dark eyes flashing and his thin lip 
quivering with scorn 

 come juggler sneered luke advancing resign the girl to me 
without delay if you have so much as injured a hair of her head you 
shall answer for it with your blood 

he extended his arms izole shrunk back from his couch 

ravoni made no reply to the sneer and the threat but his olive cheek 
flushed with deep emotion and his black eye dilating suddenly absorbed 
the space between the brow and cheek-bone but an instant ago occupied by 
the fringed eyelid the sorcerer presented a terrible picture of superhuman 
anger the sneer died on luke s lip with an involuntary start he re 
coiled a step backward and stood like a man awaking from a dream 

 izole is free exclaimed ravoni in a tone of marked calmness why 
do you not advance and claim your prize maiden thou wilt go with this 
man wilt thou not 

a look of deep emotion passed over luke s face as he gazed upon the 
beautiful countenance of izole 

maiden he exclaimed your father s last word consigned you to 



the temple of ravoni a 

my care i swore a solemn oath to guard and protect you at the hazard 
of my life come with me there is danger for you in this place danger 
worse than death 

as these low pleading tones fel on the ear of the maiden devil-bug 
crawled softly along the floor and plucking the skirt of her white robe 
looked up beseechingly in her face 

come gal he muttered you shall roll in wealth you shall wear 
silks an satins come gal this feller s a wizard an a devil leave him 
 go with them said ravoni and he unwound his arm from her waist 
izole stood alone in front of the altar she looked around with a glance 
of mysterious meaning her eyes were veiled in a mist-like film that gave 
them a wild and glassy stare first she gazed in the face of devil-bug 
and some memory of the past seemed to give its light to her bewildered 
soul then her eyes encountered the gaze of luke harvey and a murmur 
of joy burst from her lips she advanced toward him with a smile 

 i will go with you she said lead me to my father the words 
died suddenly on her lips her eyes met the glance of ravoni with a soft 
gliding motion she swam to his arms 

 with thee she whispered placing a fair hand on each- shoulder and 
looking up into his face with thee forever 

at that moment ravoni s face was sublime gazing down into the coun 
tenance of the fair young girl whose bosom heaved against his chest whose 
soft hands rested warmly on his shoulders a smile broke over his face and 
his dark eye grew radiant with delight 

 izole he whispered in a voice whose tones were music chosen of 
god called to the altar whose faith is hope to man thy name shall yet 
linger on the lips of millions a sound of blessing and praise here from 
the solemn temple here from these hearts of fire shall go forth a new 
religion like the faith which in long past ages gathered men in the city 
and the plain in the mountain and the dell as brothers children of one god 
worshippers of the majesty of eternity without tithe or priest or fane 

 hail ravoni shouted the band of enthusiasts and the group of love 
ly women the vacant-eyed maniacs and the voluptuous forms of ravoni s 
harem went whirling over the floor in a bounding dance looking upon 
their master with deep reverence these forms of animal loveliness without 
soul regarded this strange scene but as a part of the mysterious ceremonies 
of ravoni kneeling on the floor beside the silken tent byrnewood arling 
ton with the senseless form of annie gathered in his embrace looked up 
in vacant wonder 

 the maiden hath chosen said ravoni turning to luke with a calm 
smile devil-bug rose silently to his feet and stood at the fcack of the 
sorcerer gazing with a wild stare in the face of izole as she hung fasci 
nated on the very look of ravoni the savage placed his hand within the 



 the death-angels 

breast of his coarse garment and his gaze wandered from the form of thlt 
sorcerer to the face of the girl 

 she hath chosen repeated ravoni with that same calm smile as he 



gazed on the wondering face of luke she hath 



the words were half-uttered when looking over luke s shoulder into a 
large mirror that hung between two columns on the opposite side of th 
temple he beheld a sight that froze his blood he beheld a huge hand ris 
ing above his head with a glittering knife grasped in the clutch of talon 
fingers it was aimed at the bosom of izole 

one look into the mirror the glance of a single moment and ravoni 
started forward to shield her bosom from the blow he started forward a 
hoarse laugh broke on the air mingled with a deep groan of agony the 
knife had entered the back of ravoni driven with all the force of a frenzied 
arm it sunk into the flesh between the shoulder blades the sorcerer felt the 
keen point at his heart he grew purple in the face and pale by turns he 
quivered from head to foot he tottered along the floor he fell 

he fell and lay a mass of palpitating agony at the maiden s feet while 
devil-bug shook his gory hands aloft with a burst of horrid laughter 

 gal i ve saved you saved you ho-hoo 

the band of enthusiasts stood thunder-stricken the shriek of the women 
of the harem mingled with the hollow laugh of the maniacs byrnewood 
arlington laid the form of the insensible girl within the folds of the tent he 
started up and gazed upon the scene 

there on the floor quivering in the agonies of an awful soul wrestling 
with death there lay the mighty man ravoni the sorcerer the wierd 
sorcerer whose magic was in his look whose sorcery was in his tone 
now his hands clutched madly at the marble floor now his knees touched 
his chin and then his head fell backward on his shoulders his back bent 
inwards with mental agony and the soles of his feet were hidden in the 
thick curls of his long dark hair pale purple livid and ashy all hues by 
sudden turns the eyes starting from their sockets and the white lips clenched 
between his teeth his face was too fearful to look upon his agony too hor 
rible for mortal man to behold 

with one yell the enthusiasts rushed upon the murderer he dashed them 
back with his weaponless hands answering their yell with shrieks of fiend 
ish laughter 

he d a-made a nun o th gal would he ho-hoo not while old 
devil-bug had a knife to stab or a hand to strike there lays yer wizard 
wrigglin like a frog yo dogs and fools where s his eye now where s 
his devilty and witchcraft ho hoo 

the orphan maiden gazed upon the quivering form of ravoni her eyes 
rolled wildly to and fro her heart grew icy she fell insensible into luke 
harvey s arms 

aain the disciples of ravoni rushed upon the murderer of their lord 



the temple of ravoni 

there was a struggle and the dome gave back the echo of mingled shrieks 
and yells 

back touch him not spoke a calm deliberate voice the enthu 
siasts started in wonder their master with his dying form supported on 
one arm raised his head and gazed calmly over the faces of his disciples 

 i am dying he said as a glow like life warmed over his livid face 
 but do not harm my murderer 

is was the voice so low-toned so soft so musical that they had heard in 
many a by-gone hour tears fell from their flashing eyes groans of an- 
guish heaved their manly bosoms silently they gathered round their dy 
ing master luke harvey with the form of the insensible izole the priestess 
and the maiden gathered in his arms was there amid that group of dark- 
eyed fanatics and there stood byrnewood arlington gazing in mute awe 
upon the awful face of ravoni and there his solitary eye blazing with a 
vacant horror as he gazed upon his victim there stood devil-bug his loig 
arms dropped listlessly by his side in the background grouping in fear 
together were the women of the harem and the maniacs of the mad-houue 
all alike beautiful all alike stricken dumb with a strange horror 

 my children i am dying he said and for a moment his dark eyes 
flashed as though he was about to speak in the calm voice of the by-gone 
time but his head dropped his lip quivered and his gaze was fixed upon 
the floor 

in that moment a voice within him spoke to his soul words of deep and 
awful interest 

 one moment of awful thought stern believer in annihilation man of 
immortal manhood suddenly hurled from thy proud eminence of eternal 
youth has the grave its terrors for thee is there a hereafter look be 
yond the veil of time and life look is there another world thine eyes 

are opening upon the secrets of death tell us oh man of fearful will and 
magic look tell us what hopes break on thee what visions affright or enrap 
ture thy soul what is the prospect of eternity no answer no murmur 
ask thine inmost soul 

 all black dull dead vacant space darkness nothingness darkness 
darkness darkness a thousand whispering tongues from the midst of 
clouds repeat that word darkness 

annihilation oh god the terrors of hell the gnawings of eternal tor 
ture anything but this nothingness to die to die like a brute of the field 
to be thought and soul to-day dust and worse than dust reeking corruption 
to-morrow 

such were the thoughts that shook ravoni s soul in that solitary moment 
as he lay with his dying form resting on his bent arm while his dark eyes 
glared fixedly on the floor 

 and shall because this awful scene of eternal nothingness presses on 
my soul ke a raven on the corse of the battle-slain shall i play the craven 



 the death-angels 

shall these lips murmur words of drivelling penitence never never h 
is my last hour but my soul shall go out in glory 

 lift me my children lift me on my feet once again he exclaimed aloud 
in a calm deliberate voice they raised him on his feet he stood erect sup- 
ported by the arms of his disciples 

 when i give the signal then draw the knife from the wound and let 
me die he cried while his form became once more erect even as the stu 
dents encircled him with their arms his eye blazed with all its former fire 
his lip curled with the proud enthusiasm of the by-gone time he looked 
beautiful even beyond the beauty of this earth his dark hair fell waving 
aside from his brow tossed gently to and fro by a cool breath of air that 
came from the dim cloisters for a moment all was still save the lull of 
fountains the voice of birds and half-suppressed breathing of living men 

 i die said ravoni in that voice of music i die but i shall live again 
when i am dead i charge ye all take my body and let it be burned to 
ashes in my most secret chamber you will find a cabinet of ebony within 
this cabinet is deposited a volume written by my own hand a volume o-f 
parchment on whose leaves are inscribed the words of the new faith there 
you will discover the sublime truths on which the brotherhood of ravoni 
will arise from those pages will dawn upon you the secrets of the olden 
sages which the present age in its vain unbelief deems but tradition and 
fable the secret of gold and the secret of immortal youth take this dying 
hand and swear to do as with my last breath i command 

hand after hand was pressed upon those icy fingers in a few brief 
moments each fanatic of the twenty-four had taken the oath why does 
byrnewood start tremble and turn pale he felt his soul drawn toward the 
soul of the dying man by an irresistible influence he too advanced he too 
reached forth his hand but ere he could grasp the hand of ravoni that 
voice of strange enthusiasm broke on the air again 

 take the knife in thy hand he said to a student whose bronzed face 
with brilliant dark eyes deeply sunk beneath a massive brow was like the 

incarnation of an enthusiastic soul when i give the signal draw it 

from the wound and let me die when i am dead let my body be burned 
from my ashes a new being will arise the secret is written in the vol 
ume the secret that shall raise these ashes into life 

 come hither youth his face was like thine the wierd sage who first 
taught me the secret of eternal youth his name was vayomer aloheim 
wear thou that name forever when i am dying gaze in my face and in- 
hale my last breath my soul shall pass into thine thou shalt be the 
second ravoni of the faith i give thee my soul with the last word i e er 
shall speak 

no more tears from the band of disciples no more groan of agony all 
was sudden and wild enthusiasm hail ravoni burst that thunder shout 
 hai ravoni we worship thee 



the temple of ravoni 

 vayomer aloheim draw the knife from the wound and let me die 

there was a pause a terrible pause the red knife glittered in the air 
the blood gushed and poured streaming on the floor they caught it on 
their white mantles on their faces and their hands it was sacred the 
blood of their founder the blood of ravoni 

he raised himself proudly to his full heighth his dark eyes glared with 
supernatural light with folded arms he stood erect 

 farewell my children izole farewell 

the words lingered on his lips as he fell dead along the marble floor

christmas eve 

ho from the mast-head a cry shrieks through the clouds of night 

 land there to the west land aye land after a long and stormy voyage 
land after bloodshed mystery and gloom hurrah 

and now white doves bearing green leaves in their beaks glide through the 
air and fruits and flowers all from the land float on the surface of the deep 

the morning breaks from the east in glory and in promise look how the 
red beams glitter over the pinions of the doves but ha what means this 
omen where doves white and snowy floated through the air but a moment 
ago now are ravens black and gloomy they shriek a mournful death-note on s 
the ear their beaks are filled with leaves sad wintry withered leaves spotted 
with blood 

the fruits and flowers floating on the rippling bosom of the ocean where are 
they now ha ha on every wave a grinning corse-head with a raven pick- -ft 
ing its goary meal from the livid brow 

yet still that cry from the mast-head

it is the hour of christmas eve one short hour s travel down the 
wintry sky and the sun will sink to rest the sky is filled with floating 
clouds grey drifting and scarf-like along the west towers one dark and 
gloomy wall with the red sunbeams pouring over each fantastic buttress 
and pinnacle 

it is cold bitter cold it is cold bitter cold and the hungry outcast 
prowls along the sidewalk while the sleigh-bells tinkle in the street there 
is a robe of snow on the ground the old state house roof is white the 

 



 christmas eve 

very trees thrusting their bare arms on high look like stalactites in some 
colossal cavern each rugged limb and tiny branch is white with srow 

to night will be eighteen hundred and forty two years since the shep 
herds watched near bethleham to morrow is the anniversary of the birth 
of christ the lord to-night the city puts on its face of smiles the poor 
man s hearth to-night will crackle and glow with mirth and plenty the

thread-bare coat is pledge for his truth will gather round god s altar and 
watch till midnight for the coming of the lord 

to-night the city which william penn built in hope and honor whose 
root was planted deep in the soil of truth and peace but whose fruits have 
been poison and rottenness riot arson murder and wrong will put on 
its face of smiles and drink and feast and dance and pray for six hours at 
least so god bless christmas eve 

 for twenty-four long hours food has not passed these lips for three 
days and nights i have been the sport of one delusion after another my 
brain burns my pulses are on fire there is a mystery about this 
whole matter an awful mystery which must be solved ere the sun goes 
down 

folding his arms across his chest byrnewood strode toward the parlor 
window and looked out upon the wintry sky his father pale wild and 
haggard stood leaning against the mantel while his mother seated on the 
sofa gazed steadily forward with a vacant eye no word passed from her 
lips but with a half-audible moaning sound she sate rocking backwards and 
forwards while her hands clasped tightly together rested on her knee tier 
eyeballs where dry and hot no tears gave tokens of the awful sorrow that 
was consuming her soul 

the light of the declining sun reflected from the snow which covered 
the streets and house-tops gave a wild glow to byrnewood s face 

jj f ha luke harvey laid the whole atrocious plot bare to my eye i 

ransacked monk-hall this morning explored each nook and cranny of that 
infernal den but still no tokens of mary luke s suspicions and my own 
point to lorrimer as the villian but i must be sure aye sure accursed 
be the drug that destroyed my memory yet still every now and then 
gleams of light break on me i can remember scenes which the tongue 
grows palsied to tell which the heart grows cold to imagine 

his dark eyes assumed an expression of deep and painful thought while 
the sunlight fell warmly over his wrinkled visage wrinkled aye 
wrinkled and grown old with the agony of three days and nights 

 byrnewood said the old man in a faint voice i shall go mad if 
this suspense continues much longer two days of agony three sleepless 
nights i can endure it no longer god be merciful to me but it is too 
 much for an old man to bear 



home once more 

the sound of merry sleighbells tinkled in the street byrnewood s eye 
flashed and his lip quivered a handsome sleigh drawn by two blood 
horses dashed by the window and while the driver cracked his whip mer 
rily a young man sate lounging against the buffalo robe while his manly 
cheeks glowed with excitement and his rich brown hair floated waving on 
the wind 

 i have sought him all day exclaimed byrnewood he has avoided 
me if he is guiltless he need not fear my presence if he is guilty then 
god have mercy on him i will bring him to your father yes yes he shall 
kneel at your feet mother he shall swear that he knows nothing of my 
sister mary i 

with these words he rushed from the room and from the house old 
mr arlington looked from the window and saw his son dashing along the 
street in pursuit of a sly while his uncovered hair fell wildly over his 
shoulders 

 he echoed mrs arlington raising her head and speaking for trie 
first time in an hour what does byrnewood mean my dear 

 i know not i know not cried the old man still looking from the 
window mary mary he murmured in a low whisper as though 
his tongue loved to linger on the music of that name 

the fire burnt cheerily in the grate its warm glow reflected to the 
burnished furniture gave a look of comfort to the spacious parlor and the 
marks of wealth and luxury were scattered all around but what were these 
in comparison with the agony that was silently gnawing the hearts of the 
merchant and his wife what were all the wealth of counting-house land 
and rent-roll in comparison with a daughters honor j 

as the merchant arlington stood gazing out of the window with a vacant 
stare a carriage drawn by two horses whose harness betrayed the hackney 
coach drove up to the door and the coachman a gentleman with stout form 
rendered excessively corpulent by a small clothing store of over-coats sprang 
from the box and let down the steps a tall lady in deep black with a 
thick veil over her face stepped from the carriage and ascended the steps 
of the merchant s mansion 

while the old man was yet wondering who the strangers could be the 
parlor door was thrown open and the form of the white haired negro 
 levvey gran appeared in the door-way 

 massa heah is a lady a-waitin to see you bery tickler de lor moses 

it may be somefin bout de chile mary god in hebben bress her who 

knows 

as lewey spoke the tall lady entered the room and confronted mr ar 
lington from head to foot her form was veiled in deep black her cloak 
and scarf were all of the same sombre hue her face was covered by n 
thick crape veil but still the gleam of two dark eyes glanced through the 
jense folds and rested on arlington s face 
 






 christmas eve 

 your name is arlington said the strange lady in a low and whisjr- 
ing voice your daughter mary 

mrs arlington rose from her seat at that word the merchant listened in 
quivering suspense 

 your daughter mary resumed the strange lady with a business of 
tone that indicated suppressed emotion has been missing for three days 

not a word from the old man s lips but his wife murmured you bring 
news of mary heaven bless you 

 i will bring your child to you again said the stranger in a deep-toned 
voice 

 god bless you was all that passed the mother s lips 

 she is alive muttered the merchant with a fierceness of tone that had 

never marked his voice before she is well unharmed no mockery 

madam if you please because d ye see our hearts are dying dying within 
us hah you start tell me is mary living or do you come to raise 
our hopes and when we look for our own sweet child again to lay a corpse 
at our feet 

 have no fears for your daughter s life i will bring your child to you 
on one condition 

 quick name it gasped arlington and his wife in the same breath 

 that you ask your daughter no questions concerning her absence from 
nome until her mind is sufficiently calm to answer 

 we promise we agree to this condition exclaimed the father and 
mother 

 youx daughter is without in my carriage began the lady when her 
words were suddenly interrupted arlington sprang to the parlor door with 
a sudden movement he opened it my child my child he exclaimed and 
then started backward with an unexpected surprise 

on the very threshold of that door stood a maiden form veiled from head 
to foot in robes of deep black had it not been for the waving of her dress 
as the wind from the front door swept through the hall you might have fan 
cied that a carved figure of ebony stood on that threshold 

 my home exclaimed a well-known voice and the maiden advanced a 
single step my home there was a quiet pathos in the tone with wnich 
this was said that would have melted a heart of stone 

 my home she repeated again in that same whispered tone 

 my child shrieked the father and mother rushing toward her with 
outspread arms 

the maiden started back recoiling on the threshold 

stand back father stand back mother she shrieked in a tone of heart 
broken despair let me pass she cried springing on her feet and moving 
hurriedly toward the back parlor i am all unworthy of your slightest 

notice i am a poor fallen thing father a stained and dishonored girl 

mother 



home once more 

as though a bolt from heaven had splintered on his forehead arlington 
started backward with a faint cry mrs arlington gazed in tne face of her 
daughter and echoed her words dishonored dishonored 

 oh mother said mary raising her hands as if she wished to shrink from 
ner mother s very touch three days ago i crossed your threshold like one 
wall ing amid the scenes of a pleasant dream now the dream is over and 

oh let me pass mother let me hide my shame from your eyes of all 

others let me pass but do not touch the polluted thing who was once your 
daughter 

 every word she utters is a dagger in my heart muttered the tall woman 
in black as with a hurried movement she closed the folding doors which 
divided the large parlor into two apartments go in mary i ll be with 
you presently 

slowly mary advanced to the folding doors her footsteps were clogged 
and leaden she advanced she was about to enter the back parlor when 
she turned and beheld the statue-like forms of her parents her father with 
iiis grey hairs falling aside from a brow on which agony like death was 
vrithing her mother with her pale face stricken with a horror that palsied 
every feature 

mary spread her arms toward them with a wild shriek father mother 

bless your child but no and she sank back recoiling from their 

outspread arms i am forever fallen ah it was a short and blessed 
dream followed by a terrible awakening here i was to return at your 

feet i was to kneel and he oh heaven he was to kneel by my side 

and crave your blessing now father now my mother it is christmas eve 
i return but 

her head drooped on her bosom low sobs choked her utterance she 
went slowly through the folding doors 

 ha muttered the woman in black approaching the window byrne- 
wood and lorrimer the brother looks wild and pale the libertine wears 
a free and careless look but hold i will yet atone for my crime i will 
orce lorrimer to do this girl the small justice of linking her name with 
his in marriage as you wish to see the mystery unravelled she ex 
claimed aloud turning to the merchant and his wife do not i beseech 
you inform any one not even mary s brother of her return home until 
the lapse of fifteen minutes do you promise me this 

 we do murmured the parents in mechanical tones 

 they come the seducer and the avenger muttered the woman in 
black and then she glided through the folding doors 

the merchant gaed silently in the face of his wife not a word was 
uttered the agony had come at last stunning darkening and over 
whelming 

 better death than dishonor muttered the merchant after the lapse w 
a painful pause his blue eye was full of wild light 



 christmas eve 

a loud and cheerful laugh resounded from the hall ha ha my deai 
boy so ridiculous it s hardly fair pon honor hardly fair to hurry a 
fellow from a nice little party of young bloods who are about to go -sleigh- 
ing all over town and country it s hardly fair and all this haste and 
hurry that i may give the lie to a ridiculous fancy that has taken posses 
sion of your brain 

the words were interrupted by the opening of the door byrne wood 
arlington and gustavus lorrimer entered the parlor arm in arm the wild 
form and haggard face of byrpewood was in strong contrast with the easy 
devil-may-care appearance of the libertine his gold-headed cane to his 
mustachoed lips his brown hair floating aside from his manly face in easy 
curls his dark eyes dancing in careless glee he came lounging into the 
parlor and greeted the merchant and his wife with a deep and respectfnl 
bow 

 why mr wilwood excuse me is that your name i never knew 
that either you or your sister were in existence until you accosted me in the 
state house yard yesterday morning 

there stand rny father and my mother said byrnewood with sup 
pressed emotion my father has not a hope that does not hang on his 
daughter s life my mother not a thought but for her peace and joy will 
you swear in their presence that you know nothing of the place where my 
sister is concealed 

 more than that i will swear that i never spoke to her in my life 
and humming an air from the last opera lorrimer lounged toward the 
window pretty hard one that but there s but one way to overcome 
their suspicions let me ha ha put brass on my face and oil on my 
tongue i must fate it out that drug of devil-bug s had rather an 
effect on our friend s intellect 

 father cried byrnewood this strange mystery grow darker and 
leeper j the dream in whose mazes i have been wandering for days becomes 
ncre dread and horrible every instant this gentleman can solve the 
mystery and awake me from the dream listen to the oath which i now 
dictate to him if he utters a false word may the curse of a father s grey 
hairs brought down to an untimely grave rest upon him and blight him 
forever 

 my son said the old man in a husky voice i will listen ro the end 
of this dark mystery 

 and i exclaimed the mother heaven grant that the wronger of 
our child may meet with the reward of his crime 

they formed a group in the centre of that parlor lorrimer stood in 
the centre with his back to the window on either side was the father 
and mother with light of the declining day falling upon their withered 
faces 



home once more 

byrnewooa stood before him his dark eye flashing with a fixed and unal 
terable glance his cheek was like death his lips white and ashy by turns 

 do you swear by your hopes of salvation that you know nothing of 
mary arlington my sister and that you never did her wrong 

 i do said the firm and bold voice of lorrimer 

 your face is truthful and your voice is firm it must have been a 
dream another test sir and i have done if you have uttered a false 
hood do you invoke upon your head that scorn of man that doom of heaven 
that ever awaits the perjurer 

he raised his hand on high and looked fixedly in the face of lorrimer 
for a moment a slight fear darkened that handsome countenance and then 
the clear words resounded through the room 

i do 

as he spoke the folding doors swung gently apart and a maiden form 
clad in deep black glided slowly into the room a sudden glow from the 
declining sun lit up her face as she advanced her cheeks warmed with 
deep emotion her blue eyes gazed steadily in lorrimer s face 

 my sister shrieked by rnewood starting with surprise mingled with 
an awful fear my own sister mary 

it was all he could say there was a death-like sensation at his heart 
a choking feeling in his throat calm and immoveable stood gustavus 
lorrimer the light from the folding doors pouring warmly over his face 
for a moment a slight quivering movement was perceptible on his mus- 
tachced lip for a single instant his brow was darkened by a convulsive 
frown 

 now swear you never wronged that girl shrieked byrne wood in a 
tone like madness 

mary advanced her arms were outspread a glow of delight warmed 
over her face 

 lorraine she cried in a tremulous voice 

 there exclaimed lorrimer with a cool smile what more proof 
do you want she does not even know my name 

 lorraine shrieked mary as with arms outspread she glided towards 
her lover there was a sneering smile on his face his arms were folded 
and he gazed upon the girl with a half-shut eye 

mary gave one look and intense look the truth broke upon her that she 
was a disowned and dishonored thing with a faint moan as though a 
falling rock had stricken her down she fell to the floor and lay insensible 
at her seducer s feet 

 if you have uttered a falsehood or sworn to a lie shrieked byrnewcod 
with a fierce and determined look do you hope that before sunset to-day 
you may die a sudden and bloody death 

 i do exclaimed lorrimer disengaging his boot from the arm of the 
fainting girl which had fallen over it i do 



 christmas eve 

 then a sudden and bloody death you shall die arose the shriek of a 
woman s voice the iblding doors were thrown open again from the 
windows of the back parlor a stream of red sunlight poured over ihe scene 
a tall woman in dark robes stood between lorrimer and the light hei 
hand upraised and her dark eyes darting a withering look upon his hand 
some face then a sudden and bloody death you shall die for youi 
words are false as hell 

lorrimer recoiled a single step and a deep curse breathed from his lips 
u ha thus ran his thoughts bess here death and confusion 
but will brazen it out byrnewood s memory is confused he remembers 
nothing of the past 

 hear me one and all exclaimed bess as with her eye flashing and 
her hand upraised she looked like an inspired prophetess this man 
lured mary arlington from her home pure and innocent as she was he 
wronged her stainless as one of god s own angels he dishonored her 
form and darkened her soul by a hideous crime i his instrument his ac 
complice accuse him and fling his money to which the hire of judas were 
a hallowed thing i fling the wages of my crime at yon perjurer s feet 

 god of heaven shrieked the old man tottering as though he had re 
ceived his death-wound what dark confession is this 

 our child dishonored echoed mrs arlington 

 further concealment is in vain cried lorrimer with a cool supercilious 
smile your daughter was weak and foolish i was but a man 

byrnewood advanced he laid his hand lightly on the seducer s shoulder 
his face was frightfully calm 

 there are but two remedies for this wrong i give you your choice 

will y ou his voice died in his throat for a moment and a sound like 

a death groan shook his chest will you marry my sister 

the old man s blue eyes shone with a fierce glance for a moment he 
smothered the hate which rose to his eyes and lips 

 marry my daughter he shrieked save her from public shame i 
let an old man s grey hairs plead with you 

no vision of christmas eve the river and the death rose up to affright 
ihe haughty pride of the libertine to be forced to marry the girl whom 
he had seduced pah he could hear the laugh of all his hollow-heartec 
friends he could see the look and the taunt and the gibe of scorn levelled 
at his head 

 why the fact is my friends i m not a marrying man he said with 
withering politeness as he moved toward the door this affair is quite 
unpleasant and c your family and mine are quite different in their style 
you are not of our set y 

he said this and rushed from the room in a moment ere the groap m 
the parlor could recover from their astonishment the merry jingle of his 
aleigh-bells broke uoon their ears 



the personage 

 now for the other remedy shrieked byrnewood arlington nay 
hold me not father mother release my arm i will neither eat nor drink 
nor sleep until i have washed out my sister s wrong in this man 
blood 



chapter second 

the personage 

the light of the declining sun reflected from the snow on the house-tops 
poured warmly into the chamber of the millionaire in the fourth story of 
thafcolossal ton housegtdim the creole boy stood before the mirror with 
his light form clad in a neat suit of blue cloth and a small cap placed 
jauntily on his head 

 de high-golly he exclaimed slapping his nether limbs as he ad- 
dresed his tutelar deity dat ill do dis chile look like a reg lar buck 
wonder whar de debbil massa is hab n t seen him since last nighj at 
camden hows ever dere s no use o frettin bout him hah-a-whah de 
debbil always takes care his own 

opening a drawer of the dressing bureau the creole drew from thence a 
box of lucifer matches and a cigar 

 de young gemmen will take a smoke said dim with quiet dignity as 
he lit the cigar and seating himself on one chair placed his feet over the 
back of another dis habanner am prime get out now who ses 
dis chile aint a gemmen born look leah yo dam-niggar brack dem 
boots right off and den or-dah coachee to bring out de carri ge or i ll 
smash yo jaw dats de talk now de young gemmen will read this 
news 

taking a dingy yellow-grey newspaper from a chair at his elbow dim 
began to peruse its contents -ft 

hello de daily brack mail wonderful abduction case miss 
arlington missing wonder whar de debbil de murders is shockin 
calamity death of albert livingstone esq and his wife burned alive 
mansion house of hawkewood in jersey dats sornefin horrible de 
high golly 

this last ejaculation was caused by the sudden opening of the chamber 
door a figure enveloped in a blue cloak spattered with dust and mud 
approached the side of the creole boy dim gave a start and from the 
folds of the cloak appeared a wan and haggard face with stiff black 
falling in matted locks around its care-worn outlines 



 christmas eve 



 massa cried dim springing from his seat 

 h-u-s-h or i ll brain you muttered the hoarse voice of fitz-cowles 
hush not a word on the peril of your life tell me quick has lie come 

the look and tone were significant 

 yes massa he am in his roomgt down sta rs 

without a word fitz-cowles drew the cloak over his haggard face and 
rushed from the chamber 

the light of an astral lamp standing on a table littered with books and 
papers fell round a spacious chamber of the ton house furnished in a 
stleof gorgeous splendor silken curtains along the northern window 
shut out the light of the declining sun a massive mirror glittered above the 
mantel pictures in showy frames adorned the walls 

leaning against the mantel was a man of wide chest and towering 
stature clad from head to foot in deep black the light from the table fell 
over his bronzed face throwing each determined feature into bold and pow 
erful relief his dark eyes were deep sunken beneath a thick eyebrow 
over which arose the massive outline of a towering forehead there was a 
gleam in those dark eyes like the glance of an enraged vulture vivid flash 
ing and merciless there was a world of thought written on the surface of 
that ponderous brow a fearful determination in that firm mouth with ts 
compressed lips an iron will in the fixed outline of that bronzed cheek and 
massive chin 

the upper part of this man s face the forehead relieved by dark hair 
sprinkled with grey the thick brows and the deep sunken eyes was full of 
intellect and soul the lower part the nose with quivering nostrils the mouth 
with the corners inclining slightly upwards the massive cheek-bone and the 
heavy chin was full of the animal and sensual 

altogether that bronzed face was a remarkable combination of the soul 
and the brute high intellect that embraced the stars and low cunning that 
grovelled in the gutter 

the towering height of this personage gave his striking face a look of 
commanding grandeur as he stood there leaning against the mantel he 
x reminded you of those stained names which blacken the page of history 
those corrupt ministers who ruled the luxurious kings of france the stern 
visconti who with steel and poison held a malignant sway over the desti 
nies of italy or those tyrants of the ancient rome who endeavored to for 
get their humble origin in seas of blood and crime 

 hah ejaculated the personage fixing his eyes u 
hung opposite man of thoughtful brow and chjyalrous look as your 
worshippers style their idols what avail has been your mind and chivalry 
against my craft have you not risen in my path at every point of my 
ambition and have i not dragged you down from the high pinnacle ogyour 
hopes ha ha craft i say craft was my silent and certain weapon 



the personage 

the mob hah curses on them eternal curses why must they worship 
an idol like that have i not stooped to them flattered them cajoled them 
ave until my gorge rose with loathing by the god that rules the fate of 
nationswhen i look over their crumbling fragment of a republic i see ri 
sing above its ruins the giant image of a empire and a king i 

his clenched hand was raised in the air and his vulture eye shot rays cf 
fire tell me was that the man to trust with power 

then looking with a sneer into the face of the portrait he sate down 
beside the table and the light strongly shone over his massive brow as he 
glanced at the papers which littered the cloth here were maps of states 
and kingdoms territories and provinces here too were piles of letters bearing 
the signatures of various men scattered all over the world dollar worship 
ping merchants scheming politicians mighty statesmen lords aud minis 
ters of kingdoms here too was a letter bearing the sign manual of a 
crowned sovereign 

 there are some men who would give their lives to know the secrets 
which lie scattered over this table said the personage with a grim smile 
as he drank from a foaming pitcher which stood beside the lamp it was a 
stout old fellow of a pitcher that and as it smoked and foamed it could 
not have contained cold water 

hah that juice of the rye is somewhat strong exclaimed he 
smacking his lips but i must be careful minds that have endured the 
shocks of fate without a murmur have gone out forever with the indulgence 
of an appetite still that rye is excellent 

the door opened there was a footstep and the haggard form of fitz- 
cowles advanced toward the table 

the personage looked upon him with a glance of cool astonishment 
twelve hours had worked a fearful change with the handsome millionaire 
his cheeks were sunken his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets his 
were stained with blood drawn from the skin by his compressed teeth 

 well sir said the personage what now 

 last night i was arrested for forgery exclaimed fitz-cowles forgery 
on the house of livingstone harvey co for the amount of one hundred 
thousand dollars i escaped from the police officers for a night and a day 
i have evaded their search 

 you are guilty said the personage in a quiet tone 

fitz-cowles assented by a nod of his head 

 what have you done with the money 

 it is safe in new york i sent it on yesterday morning directed to a 
fictitious name 

well sir what is your business with me said the personage gazing 
n fitz-cowle s face with half-closed eyes 

 the gaol the cell the lash all threaten me you must save me 



 christmas eve 

 pray sir exclaimed the personage with a smile of withering politeness 
may know the nature of your claims upon my assistance 

 certainly sir exclaimed fitz-cowles returning his withering sneer 
 for ten years past i have received large sums of money from your hands 
ft was you that rescued me at new orleans when i was about to be tried 
for that little scrape on the gulf thrice you saved me from imminent dan 
ger and until last march you paid me a regular pension of four thousand 
dollars a year 

 well sir interrupted the personage in a dry and biting tone 

on your past favors i found my present claims 

 juan larode you grow insolent and the personage rising with a calm 
sneer on his lip there is the door to the gaol or to the devil as you 
like but you gain no aid from me go 

juan larode echoed fitz-cowles as his eyes gleamed deadly rage 
old man dare you insult me with my mother s name 

 yes yes he cried moving to the door i will go to gaol i will be 
heralded from north to south as a forger but it shall be under your name 
old man as your son as juan 

he gave a clear and biting enunciation to the name of the personage 
 bastard of a creole slave muttered the personage with his eyes flash 
ing incarnate scorn dare you speak to me thus 

 do not put yourself in a passion father said fitz-cowles resuming 
his seat with a hollow mocking laugh here is the marriage certificate of 
my mother which you gave me four years ago 

the personage sate down and gazed in the face of the forger eye met 
eve sneer met sneer scowl gloomed on scowl at that moment the resem 
blance between the two was fearful and striking 

but that deadly fire gleaming from those vulture eyes that thick vein 

shooting up between the thick eye-brows fitz-cowles quailed before 

that look and frown 

 a paltry forgery laughed the personage think you juan larode 
that had that certificate been genuine i would have ever let it pass into your 
hands when i employed you as a spy yes scowl as you will as a spy a 
pimp and spy i wished to bind you to me by the substantial link of legiti 
mate relationship t gave you that forged certificate in order that you might 
th nk yourself my lawful son i knew that would not betrnv vour father 
ha ha ha and he laughed loud and long your father 

fitz-cowle s grew white in the face the hollow laugh of the man with 
the massive forehead and vulture eye s smote his ears like a de ith-knell 

 bastard he muttered the foul word and buried his face in his hands 

the personage sate looking upon him with a look of scorn 

in the gaol he will trouble me no more he muttered in gaol for life 

fitz-cowles raised his brow from his hands there was an expression of 
utter desolation in every line of his face 



the personage 

 sir i will go and to my doom he said in a subdued tone but ere 
i go you will allow me to ask you one trifling question do you remembei 
that package enveloped in yellow paper and sealed with three black seals 

the tone of fitz-cowles was mild and subdued but there was a devil s 
light in his eye the face of the personage changed color brow and cheek 
became lividly pale 

 what know you of that package he said in a careless tone you 
never saw it but once and then only the seals and the envelope 

 good eveningyaer said fitz-cowles rising with a pleasant smile 
 i ll never trouble you more 

the personage rose suddenly he dragged a massive trunk from under the 
table unlocked it and opening a secret lid drew from thence a massive 
package enveloped in yellow paper and sealed with three black seals 

 hah it is safe he muttered while fitz-cowles stood smiling beside 
the door 

 safe ha ha ha laughed the forger that sneering laugh was full 
of meaning 

with a sudden movement the personage broke upon the package seal 
after seal cracked between his fingers he unrolled the envelope and dis 
covered a mass of blank paper folded in the shape of letters 

 ha ha ha i thought the day might come when that package would 
prove servicable false keys and false seals ha ha ha 

the personage bent his head slowly down to the table his eyes sunken 
yet deeper in their sockets glared with fearful intensity 

 each of those letters is worth a thousand lives my name my honor 
will be eternally blasted by the revelation of a single letter and then my 
friends my associates all he clenched his hands fixedly together and 
was silent for a moment come here juan larode he said in a 
calm and even voice 

with a fearless step fitz-cowles approached the table inclining his 
head slightly to one shoulder the personage gazed upon him with a side 
long glance his fingers quivered tremulously and his face wore a smile 
that but faintly disguised the emotion which branched from his heart through 
every vein 

 you have those papers he said in a quiet tone 

 i have answered fitz-cowles you know father it would n t be 
at all handsome for you to see those documents published in the papers j 
some bright morning as wonderful disclosures ha ha ha 

that laugh died away into a groan with one vigorous movement of 
his stalwart arm the personage gathered fitz-cowles within his grasp and 
without rising from his seat he dragged the forger to his knees 

 now he shouted as his muscular fingers encirrled the throat of the 
bravo u now craven you must yield those papers or die with a look 
of coc determination he tightened his grasp until fitz-cowles grew purple 



 christmas eve 

in the face slowly his eyes began to start from their sockets the ille 
gitimate lay helpless in the grasp of his father struggling quivering gasp- 
ing for breath 

 the papers moaned fitz-cowles i gave them to a friend to 

keep for me in case i am imprisoned or or murdered this friend will 
despatch those letters to a friend of yours ha ha ha already they are 
enveloped and directed to his address 

with a choaking laugh he pointed to the portrait which hung on the wall 
opposite the mantel 

as though a palsy had stricken his arm the personage let go his grasp 

 get up juan larode he said in a calm voice you shall not go 
to gaol something must be done for you 

 

in less than a month fitz-cowles walked the streets a free man the 

mysteries of the forgery the hooks and crooks by which that pliable old 
gentleman the law was evaded and conciliated are they not written in the 
chronicles of the criminal courts 

who was the individual so mysteriously denominated the personage 
the documents from which this history are drawn are dark on that point 
but the reader may rest assured that the personage was either a canadian 
statesman or a british lord or a mexican prince 



chapter third 

monk-hall once more 

 what the devil yo skeered about niggers growled devil-bug turn 
ing hastily to his attendants aint i in my own home agin aint i in 
monk-hall 

 but massa de poleese is at de door muttered musquito 

 and massa de neighborhood is riz on us exclaimed glow-worm 

the sound of a loud shout mingled with yells and groans came thunder- 
fig through the front door then came a sound of violent knocking fol- 
jwed by a heavy crashing noise as though stout arms were breaking the 
panels of the door with billets of massive timber 

 come niggers said devil-bug foller me 

taking each of them a lamp in his hand from the table in the centre of the 
door-keeper s room they followed devil-bug who silently led the way down 
stairs he paused for a moment to look into the banquet-room the glare of the 
kimps flashed upon the form of the skeleton monk standing at the head of the 



monk-hall once more 

able scattered over with goblets and wine-glasses the relics of the last 
feast of the monks of monk-hall 

an expression of strange meaning came over devil-bug s face as he 
looked around the ancient room but not a word passed his lips his soli 
tary eye was unusually bright and his wide lips placed fixedly together 
slowly and silently he led the way down into the dead-vault of monk-hall 

 these old pillars is all the friends i ever had muttered devil-bug 
looking into the faces of the negroes with a strange stare these ol 
walls and these pillars and these ceilin s and these floors has always beer 
friends to me t 

the negro glow-worm looked into musquito s face with a vacant stare 
there was something in the manner of their master that excited their 
wonder 

 look here niggers exclaimed devil- bug there s no use o leavin 
the corpse o that jew above ground and so i b lieve we ll go and bury 
him hello he exclaimed as his eye rested upon a massive piece of rock 
placed against one of the brick pillars t wonders how that ud vork 

 what de debbil massa mean asked glow-worm 

 you see that rock s about three feet square answered devil-bug f it 
must a-been a piece o th foundation o monk-hall d ye see yo d n 
niggars wot i mean spose you shove that rock to that trap door and 
tumble it down into the pit o monk-hall don t yo think that jew s corpse 
ud be considerably smashed won t it be a sight easier than buryin him 

the negroes grinned hideously at each other and a loud african guffaw 
resounded through the dead vault 

 hah a-whah wot a dam idea-r 

the sound of yells and shouts mingled with the crashing of the front 
door panels came thundering down the staircase aid echoed through the 
vault 

 look here niggers that feller s body must be hid afore the poleese 
jomes i ll go down into the pit and fix it right under the trap and when 
give the word do you let the rock fall d ye hear niggers 

 yes massa chorussed the insects in a breath devil-bug sei-zed one 
of the lamps and strode rapidly from the dead-vault while the negroes bent 
their huge forms to the difficult task 

the light flashed over the arch of the deep stairway as devil-bug went 
rapidly down into its depths 

 queer he muttered cursed queer i don t see nayther of em 
tne man with the broken jaw the woman with the l oiler skull ha 
here s the old pit ag in with it s grave yard smell its big pillars o brick 
an its beams of oak here i used to tumble about when i was a little bit 
of an ugly devil here i ve seen many sights that j ud freeze most people s 
blood and here ho hoo 

over crumbling piles of boards over heaps of broken furniture devil 



 christmas eve 

bug wnt tramping through the gloomy cavern while the rats started from 
their hooks and the reptiles twining round the stout oaken beams glistened 
brightly in the lamp-beams rendered dim and flickering by the foul air of 
he place 

 f must be near the centre o th pit exclaimed devil-bug when a 
start quivered through his frame and a laugh half surprise half fear 
shrieked from his lips as a whizzing sound echoed through the air and a 
lerd of rats disturbed from their loathsome meal darted away from the light 
in the full glare of the lamp lay the mangled remains of a human body 
clothing flesh and features crushed into one undistinguishable mass of cor- 
uption and blood 

 ha gabr el von gelt you lay quiet enough quiet as a lamb 
chuckled devil-bug gazing toward the roof of the vault far above ho 
hoo the crittur fell right below the trap-door down plumb as a stone 

as he spoke there flashed the glare of a light from the roof of the vault 
it quivered through the air and resting on devil-bug s matted hair formed 
a long and bright column in the midst of darkness 

devil-bug spurned the body of the jew aside and placed the lamp on a 
stone not more than two feet from the spot where he stood the air of 
the vault was foul and stifling and the lamp flickered with a faint and tre 
mulous light then folding his arms with that column of light from the dis 
tant roof pouring on his head devil-bug stood silent and erect his tang 
led hair fell waving round his face while his compressed lips and glaring 
eye indicated a deep and settled resolve the rumbling of the rock along 
the floor above came heavily to his ear 

 ha the g-a-l shall roll in wealth dress in silks an satin s and be a 
lady all her life old devil-bug s daughter with the mark o the red snake 
on her right temple it s all settled parson pyne thinks she s the first 
child o nell tho he told me she was the second he said so afore luke 
to day ho hoo old devil-bug s daughter among the grandees o th 
quaker city 

again that rumbling sound from the roof far overhead broke on his 
car the rock drew nearer to the chasm and devil-bug chuckled grimly 
to himself 

 hello niggers are yo ready he shouted at the top of his voice 
 yes massa the answer came fainly to his ear 
 let it drop shrieked devil-bug there was a pause 
the light shone over his face it was agitated by a frightful smile 
 good bye nell he said and smiled 

then a sound like a mighty building falling to the ground shook the 
cavern it was but for an instant there was a heavy crash and all was 
darkness save that dim column of light streaming from the distant trap 
door a single beam struggled down through the darkness and rested 



monk-hall once more 

jpon the rough surface of the massive rock as it lay sunken deep in the 
cavern earth 

hello massa came the voice of musquito from the trap-door did 
dat ar smash de jew 

not a word not even a word in reply ha ha devil-bug was lying 
dormant behind some massive pillar without a doubt chuckling as he 
thought of the jew s corpse buried beneath the rock he was such a jolly 
old boy was devil-bug 

all at once like the yell of fire in the dead of night on board a ship 
at sea a wild and thundering noise echoed from the stairway leading 
down into the pit in a moment the cellar was filled by people brandish 
ing torches and clubs in their upraised hands 

 hurray hurray we ve trapped the murderer they shouted rush- 
ng in various directions through the wide cavern 

 here he is hidin behind the stone cried a well-known voice and 
easy larkspur holding a light in one hand and a pistol in the other ad 
vanced toward a massive rock which uprose from the cavern earth 

 here he is hidin behind this rock he cried as his face warmed with 
excitement resembled the full moon in a crimson mist corne out o that 
mister or i ll shoot come out i say 

there was no answer devil-bug was lying quiet and snug behind the 
rock waiting to spring on his antagonists 

 fellers stand by me said larkspur looking round into the faces of 
some dozen deppities o th honorable ma or i ll jist lean over the 
rock and take a peep at the varmint 

laying his ponderous weight on the rock the light extended in one hand 
the pistol in the other larkspur leaned gently over the opposite side 
and looked down for a single moment he remained in this attitude and 
then rose on his feet again and looked into the visages of the officers his 
face so lately burning red was now the color of yellow clay the cold 
sweat trickled down his features his bulging eyes were full of fright and 
horror 

by g d he cried in a tone that filled his comrades with horror it 
was so different from his usual voice i don t want to see a sight like that 
twice in a life-time a body smashed beneath a big rock an a head stickin 
out with a face all purple and the eye laid on the cheek and tongue lollin 
from the mouth ugh gen elmen he continued in a husky whisper 
 our pns ner s escaped an that s a fact

chapter fourth 

the meeting of the brother and the libertine 



around the blazing stove in theojster cellar were gathered a band of 
some twenty loungers smoking and swearing in a breath while smoky 
chiffin thelod of the cavern stood behind the bar dealing out hot whiskey 
punch and other fragrant liquids to a numerous band of customers

in glorious spirits whether he looked at the conventual stalls in the back- 
ground crowded with hungry citizens or the oyster box lined with shell 
fish devotees or the liquor bar thronged with thirsty worshippers of that 
jolly old giant of a decanter the prospect was alike refreshing to his pocket 
i and spirits 

two little men were walking up and down the marble floor of the eel 
lar performing an easy promenade from the looking glass to the hot stove

thin lips and looked at poodle with those dresden wax-doll eyes

 then they said that one of my best female contributors went to bed 

every night with a junk bottle of whiskey under her pillow will you 

refute that 

ere poodle could reply the stout form of easy larkspur arrayed in a 
grey overcoat stepped between him and the little magazine man 

he fixed his eye on the editor of the black mail with a look of supreme 
scorn 

 is you the squirt wot edits the black mail he asked in a tone of 
quiet wonder is you that little crooked-leg snub-nosed squirt wot the 
calls poodle 

these words were far from being complimentary poodle grew red in 
the face and then pale as his shirt bosom there was a dangerous look 
in larkspur s bulging eyes poodle squinted over his shoulder to the cel 
lar stairs and to the door 

 is you the werry contemptible squirt as made fun of my personal 
ape rence in your paper t other day growled larkspur shaking his fist 
under buzby s nose 

 oh it was n t me it was somebody else stammered the little editor 

 it wos wos it you small pattern of a man you remnant of creation 
you larkspur grew red in the face with rage you poo-die 

 sir indeed you re mistaken in the person faltered buzby 

 there s no use o lyin you ve got to be licked an i ve got to do it 

with these words he coolly tweaked the unresisting poodle by the nose 
and boxed his ears with the palm of his hand the little editor st rted 
toward the door but larkspur caught him by the wig and as poodle wrig 
gled from his grasp he held the trophy in his hand 

 why consarn my buttons the feller wears a wig cried larkspur in 
deep astonishment as he flung the mass of curly hair on the floor where it 
lay with the inside exposed to the light like a spittoon or a dish 

a roar of laughter shook the cellar smokey chiffin underwent a violem 
convulsion and the gentlemen around the blazing stove indulged in a loud 
guffaw poodle stood in the centre of the floor his naked head but scanti 
ly clothed with sparsely settled hair stiff and uncouth as a shoe brush whu 
larkspur stood opposite expectorating tobacco juice into the crown of the 
curly wig 

 



 christmas eve 

there my feller make fun o my personal n oe rence agin 
larkspur adding a handfull of pea-nut shells to the tobacco juice pel- 
ter rake up yer head o hair an travel 

his eye was fixed upon the editor s face poodle stooped to the floor 
seized the wig placed his hat under his arm and made for the door 

 by jove he snivelled as he crushed the wig tobacco juice pea-nul 
shells and all down upon his cranium this is n t the fair thing if it i 
damme 

 come my feller give us the domestic french for that exclaimed 
easy larkspur put it down in the black mai under the head of atro 
cious outrage on the liberty of the press an editors wig pulled off and 
filled with tobacco juice an ground-nut shells 

these last words escaped poodle s ear with editorial celerity he had 
vanished from the cellar 

petriken stood gazing round the place in vague wonder listening with 
evident chagrin to the hoarse laughter of the by-standers as they made 
merriment out of poodle s disgraceful hegira 

there was the sound of a hurried footstep petriken felt a hand laid on his 
shoulder and gus lorrimer stood by his side 

 the devil s to pay my boy he exclaimed in a quick and hurried 
whisper the very devil s to pay about this girl the family will raise the 
whole town on me the father and mother and i dont know how many 
couzins suspect me and will doubtless take steps to give me considerable 
annoyance silly we must leave town until the storm blows over 

 leave town echoed silly who had grown suddenly pale in the face 
 say gus you must n t drop a word about my playing parson where 
will we go raising the devil are they what a pity you did n t let the 
girl alone 

 let the girl alone cried lorrimer while his eyes shone and his cheek 
glowed phsaw the girl was pretty loveable her eye was a melt 
ing blue her lip a delicious ruby like pretty and loveable girls with 

blue eyes and ruby lips mary arlington pleased my fancy i wooed and 
won her now for the consequences we must leave town till the storm 
is over come silly 

he turned toward the door with a laugh on his lips but that laugh in 
an instant was changed into a muttered curse 

the brother of mary arlington stood between the libertine and the door 
his uncovered forehead pale as ashes corrugated in a fixed frown while his 
dark eyes sunken deep beneath the brows emitted a wild and deadly light 
while his cloak fell back from his shoulder he raised his white hand slowly 
in the air 

here in this cellar three nights ago you boasted of the seduction of 
my sister ho said in a calm and deliberate voice you filled my ears 
tmh your atrocious plot i sat listening to the s ry of my sisters sharm 



the meeting of the brother and the libertine 

while the wine cup was in mv hand the light laugh on my lip here in 
this vile retreat of the vilest dissipation you must give me satisfaction for 
he wrong you have put upon me and mine here my sister s honor shall 
be avenged and in your blood will i wash out her shame 

his tones were fearfully calm while the loungers started up in wonder 
and petriken slunk into a dark corner lorrimer stood in the centre of the 
cellar gazing over byrnewood s shoulder upon the large mirror which 
adorned one end of the saloon 

 you must fight me said byrnewood as he presented two pistols to the 
silent libertine take your choice of weapons 

 fight you echoed lorrimer in an absent tone as he stood gazing over 
the brother s shoulder into the mirror ha ha ha he laughed turning 
suddenly to the keeper of the saloon who was leaning over the bar 

say chiffin why d ye have such pictures in your cellar d n it man 

do you mean to frighten me by such cursed nonsense look there i say 
look there who painted that broad river with its waves turned to blood 
by the last rays of the setting sun and my head sinking between the 
waters with that hand clenching my throat and that foot trampling me down 
to a shameful death who has dared to paint that mockery there 

with his outstretched hand he pointed to the mirror he turned his livid 
face from side to side while his lip writhed and his hazel eye rolled wiih a 
maniac wildness the hallucination was upon him in all its horror christ 
mas eve the river and the death rushed on his soul in hues of doom and blood 

 you must answer for your crime on this spot shouted byrnewood 
advancing to the libertine hah coward are you silent do you think 
to scare me from my purpose with this silly mummery will no words no 
scorn rouse you to something like manhood then take the insult of a blow 

with his clenched hand he struck lorrimer on the chest and then seized 
him by the throat 

the libertine gazed at him with a vacant stare as he cooly unwound the 
grasp of those writhing fingers 

 fool he cried pointing to the mirror look my face in yon picture 
changes to yours it is my hand that clenches your throat it is my foot 
that tramples you beneath the waters fight you he continued suddenly 
as the livid hues of his countenance were succeeded by a henlthy glow 
 pshaw man have i not wronged the sister why should i murder the 
brother 

with a half-mocking smile he pushed byrnewood from his path and rushed 
up the cellar steps the brother stood like a man in a dream gazing around 
the crowd of wondering faces that looked upon him on every side while the 
clear ringing sound of sleigh-bells in motion came echoing down the cellar 
stairs that sound roused him from his sudden stupor he buried the pis 
tols in his bosom he rushed from the cellar 

he was in the street but he knew it not the cold wind broke over his 



 christmas eve 

uncovered brow the beams of the setting sun glistened among the ringlets 
of his waving hair he did not behold the sun he did not feelthe oitter wind 
all was darkness and heat within and without darkness while chesnut 
street was alive with the prancing of gallant steeds the gliding of sleighs 
the merry jingle of bells heat while the winter sun shone over the state 
house roof and the wide streets all white with snow heat that burned his 
brain and turned his eyes to flame 

all was darkness yet his eye beheld that distant sleigh drawn by two 
gallant steeds byrnewood had a vague consciousness of eyes fixed upon 
him of houses rushing by him yet still his eye was fixed upon that sleigh 
upon that form partly seen above its pannels upon the ruddy face turned 
over the shoulder with locks of rich brown hair tossed wildly on the wind 
this face this form he saw but nothing more the face every moment 
grew more distant yet every moment to him the frenzied brother each 
line and feature was more plain and distinguishable 

he rushed down chesnut street with his arms outspread his hair flying 
on the wind his dark eyes flashing on the distance the crowd gave way 
before his footsteps plumed belle and soft-visaged exquisite sober mer 
chant and prattling child walking by its mother s side on that pavement of 
beauty and fashion started aside at his approach 
 it was a madman the shout rung from lip to lip 
he passed the marble columns of the massive bank where the hopes of 
 thousands lie entombed he passed a long array of glittering stores and then 
his path was thronged by a crowd of ragged boys who made the air ring 
with shouts and cries 

they held papers under their arms and in their hands shouting their con 
tents in loud and boisterous tones for a single moment byrnewood listened 
 the seduction of mary arlington with a portr-a-i-t daily black mail 
only one cent 

the shame of his sister paraded in the columns of a leprous sheet the 
mouth-piece of the ruffian and the courtezan a thing so vile that to men 
tion its name in a decent presence is an insult and a disgrace the thought 
was fire to byrnewood s vein s 

he dashed onward he turned the corner of third street his eye still fixed 
upon the sleigh in a moment he stood in front of the girard bank when his 
career was suddenly terminated he felt his hand pressed in a manly grasp 
and a friendly voice rung in his ears 

 my god byrnewood what does this mean cried the hearty tones of 
luke harvey why are you rushing like a madman along the street 
the seducer of my sister he must die gasped byrnewood 
 ha muttered luke his sister s wrong has disturbed his reason i 
must lure him from the city or he will commit some desperate deed come 
byrnewood he added aloud you shall have revenge a word in your ear 
lorrimer takes the cars for baltimore this afternoon we will follow him 
 we will shrieked byrnewocd to the death 



sunset on christ m as eve 



chapter fifth 

sunset on christmas eve 

the warm glow of the setting sun gleaming through an opening in the 
clouds streamed down the hill of walnut street over the wharf and along 
ihe broad bosom of the delaware 

some few idlers were lounging round the doors of the hotel here and 
there stood a vagrant along the edges of the wharf gazing indolently at the 
form of the retreating ferry boat which some hundred yards from shore 
was ploughing its way through the waters of the delaware toward the dim 
shores of jersey 

suddenly the sun disappeared behind a cloud and two figures came 
hastening down walnut street rushing hurriedly through the snow toward 
the wharf in a few moments they attained the edge of the wharf they 
stood upon the ferry landing and gazed upon the retreating steamboat 
while an expression of deep chagrin spread over their faces 

 curse the thing cried the tallest of the twain whose manly form was 
enveloped in a tight-fitting white over-coat we are too late for the boat 

with an oath on his lips he then gazed nervously along walnut street 
and paced the wharf with a wild and hurried footstep 

his companion a little man wrapped up in a large cloak with a well- 
polished glazed cap on his head also cast an eager look along walnut 
street and then gazed at the retreating ferry boat with a deep muttered 
curse 

 gus we re too late for the boat he exclaimed in a hurried whisper 
 had n t we better go up home again i dont exactly like the idea of 
standing here in this jpublic place - 

 i will leave this town to-night exclaimed lorrimer aye leave the 
quaker city if i have to swim to yonder shore tell me good fellow is 
there no way of crossing to camden 

he spoke to a weather-beaten man whose broad shoulders and brawny 
chest were enveloped in a stout pea-jacket while an old tarpaulin hat 
shadowed over his sunburnt brow 

 that s the last ferry boat mister said the fisherman but i ve got a 
boat layin alongside the wharf there that would take you over in a jiffey 

 quick there s a dollar for you cried lorrimer in hurried tones 
row us over in time for the new-york cars and i ll make it five 

ere a moment passed petriken and the fisherman were seated in the boat 
while lorrimer lingered on the edge of the wharf 

for a single instant he stood with his handsome form raised to its full 
height while the wind played with the curb of his dark brown hair hia 



 christmas evk 

haze eye gleamed with light while his mustachioed lip was compressed 
with some deep emotion 

 christmas eve he muttered tareweli to the quaker city and fare- 
well for many a day 

he leaped into the boat and seated himselt by hetriken s side in the 
seat nearest the bow 

u trim boat cried the fisherman as he sat in the central seat with an 
oar grasped in each sturdy hand trim boat an i ll make the crittur fly 

he was about to urge the boat into the stream when his attention was 
arrested by a voice from the wharf two persons stood soliciting a passage 
to the opposite shore one was a tall quaker whose broad-brimmed haf 
shadowed a fine venerable face while his ruddy cheeks contrasted with his 
snow white hair presented the tokens of a green old age he was dressed 
in dark brown attire shapen after the peculiar fashion of his sect a capa 
cious great coat reaching to his heels thrown open in front revealing the 
under coat and voluminous waistcoat all of the same respectable hue 

 friend he said in a calm even voice i will be much obliged to thee 
for a place in thy boat in case thou art bound for camden 

 and i said a harsh and shrill voice at his side will give you five 
dollars if you will row me over in time for the new-york cars 

the person who last spoke was clad in an over-coat of coarse grey but 
toned up to his throat with a fur cap drawn down over his head and a 
large black kerchief tied round his cheeks and mouth from between the 
upraised collar of his coat and his dark fur cap a few locks of snow-white 
hair fell waving on the wind 

come on gentlemen said the old fisherman in his bluff hearty tones 
 jump in the boat an i ll spin you over like a top take that seat in the 
starn now then trim boat and away we go 

the boat darted from the wharf with the old fisherman seated in the cen 
tre while lorrimer and petriken occupied the front seat and the quaker 
sate beside the old man in the stern 

for a few moments all was silent save the sullen dipping of the oars 
one thick mass of clouds lay over the city and along the western horizon 
a dense gloom covered the face of the waters not a ray shone over the sur 
face of a rippling billow not a single golden beam lighted on the crest 
of a rolling wave lorrimer turned his face over his shoulder and glanced 
vacantly at the other occupants of the boat there was a calm smile on the 
face of the quaker but the man in the gray surtout sate with his head 
drooped on his folded arms while his long white hair lay floating on his 
shoulders one eager glance at the sky and lorrimer gazed in the pallid 
face of petriken who sate like a statue by his side he was about to speak 
lo his minion but the strange gloom which fell from the clouds upon the 
waters cast its shadow on his soul 

 it is a cold wind my friend said the quaker to the old man m the 



sunset on christmas eve 

grey surtout a bitter cold wind and look yonder surely those are 
snow flakes tossing in the air 

 yes it is cold was the reply of the old man by his side as ne sate 
with his head drooped upon his folded arms 

there was something so harsh and repulsive in the manner of this man 
that the old quaker apparently baulked in his effort to start a conversation 
with him addressed his next remark to the boatman 

 can thee tell me friend whether this darkness is caused by the clouds 
or is it sunset indeed 

sunset echoed lorrimer turning in his seat and gazing over the 
boatman s shoulder into the quaker s face who talks of sunset ah 
excuse me sir he continued as if startled by his own abruptness i 
thought the remark was addressed to me but tell me my good fellow 
has the sun gone down or is this sudden darkness but the shadow of yon- 
der wall of clouds 

 it wants five p rhaps ten minutes of sunset young gentleman was 
the answer of the boatman 

lorrimer turned his face to the jersey shore with an expression strange 
and doubtful in its character true his dark hazel eyes gleamed with a 
steady glance true his manly cheek glowed with a ruddy hue but thore 
was a gloom on his brow as vague and undefinable as the shadow resting 
on the bosom of the delaware 

pshaw he muttered the boat creeps along with a snail s pace 
would i could feel my feet upon the solid ground again would wh 
silly you sit there like a stone why don t you say something man 

 the fact is gus my spirits are rather low returned the little man 
with chattering teeth it s cursed cold on the river too that wind cuts 
a fellow like knives 

there was silence in the boat again she darted over the waves with a 
light careering motion while the dipping of the oars into the sullen wafers 
struck the ear with a wild and mournful sound the dark atmosphere 
was whitened with falling snow flakes which came dowry vith a fluttering 
motion and sunk into the waves like birds dissolving all at onoe into thin air 

in silence the boat approached the island which arises in the lordly dela 
ware she entered the canal which divides this bank of land in twain the 
sound of the dipping oars broke on the air mingled with the hoarse murmurs 
of the waves as they dashed against the oaken planks which line the shores 
of the channel still all was gloom upon the waters still the flakes of snow 
came gently down still all was silence within the boat 

this channel was soon cleared the city lay on the west like a black wall 
of houses roofs and mast-heads the boat darted toward the camden shore 

lorrimer s head was bent on his breast thoughts of his home came 
gathering around his heart like dear hopes and sad farewells he beheld 
the parlor lighted by the ohristmas eve fire he saw the form of his mother 



 christmas eve 

the angel-face of his sister and then the thought of mary tne betrayed 
the dishonored came over him grim and ghastly as a pall flang over a bed 
of roses 

 would to god we could reach the jersey shore he muttered 

 my foot once on that soil all these gloomy thoughts will banish 

the clouds broke in the west in glorious piles and towers and pinnacles 
they broke and the red sun poured a flood of glory over the waters as their 
rolling subsided to a soft and undulating motion every tiny wave was gold 
every ripplet quivered in floods of voluptuous light 

lorrimer glanced over his shoulder the aged quaker was gazing round 
in calm delight while the old man in the grey coat still sate with his head 
drooped on his folded arms with a murmur of admiration he gazed upon 
the distant city as its steeples rose in living light the river was a sheet 
of floating gold the western horizon was filled with a gorgeous world of 
clouds rising pile on pile with the light of the setting sun streaming over 
the spires and roof of the city while the white snow-flakes floated in the air 
like birds whose hues were beautiful as the rays of a star 

never had the sky looked so gorgeous the river so lovely the city so much 
like home 

with a murmur of delight lorrimer rose on his feet gazing toward the 
west with dilating eyes 

the full glory of the sun poured over his manly form as it rose in all its 
towering height it shone gladly over his face with its handsome features 
the curving lip darkened by a mustache the glowing cheeks the open brow 
with the brown locks tossing in the air his eyes were full of life his brow 
grew radient with the deep joy of existence quivering through every vein 
he stood the incarnation of manly glory and pride 

 ha ha he muttered in a half audible tone on christmas eve at the 
hour of sun-down one of ye will die by the other s hand ha ha the 
shadow is gone from my soul it is christmas eve and the prophecy is false 
he gazed toward the massive edifice of the navy yard and then as he 
stood with out-spread arms his eye was attracted by some object floating in 
the water near the boat it was a fur cap half concealed by a mass of waving 
grey hair while a syllable of wonder trembled on fyis lip he turned his gaze 
to the boat and the life-blood at his heart grew cold 

there there right before his face at the back of the old boatman stood 
a quivering form there his eye met the gaze of a dark eye flashing incar 
nate hate there his sight was blasted by the vision of a livid face with long 
dark hair streaming wildly aside from a brow like death the stranger 
whose hair was white had vanished in his place towered the form of the 
avenger byrnewood arlington 

lorrimer gave but a single look and then frozen with a strange horror 
he beheld the arm extended he saw that pale hand he saw the pistol 
pointed at his heart 



sunset on christmas eve 

u back i he shrieked you dare not murder me the prophecy u 
fel fi e hah 

 in the name of mary arlington die was the awful arid deliberate 
sentence of the avenger 

there was the sudden report of a pistol there was a cloud of curling 
blue smoke in a moment it cleared away his clenched hand raised 
stiffly in the air his chest heaving with an awful agony his parted lips dis 
closing his gnashing teeth his hazel eyes bulging from their sockets lorri- 
mer stood for a single instant and then with a faintly-muttered name he fell 

 mary the word gurgled upward with his death groan as he lay with 
his back against the hard plank of the seat while his head sunk to the bot 
tom of the boat a thick stream of blood gushed from his chest and stained 
the hands of the boatman petriken s livid face was red with the life-current 
of the libertine 

with one simultaneous cry of horror the quaker the boatman and the 
ninion started to their feet the boat quivered like a child s toy on the 
agitated waves 

that cry of horror shook the air again 

byrnewood arlington knelt on the bottom of the tossing boat the dead 
man s head upon his knees 

his face was the face of a maniac every feature quivered every linea 
ment trembled with a joy more horrible than death his black eyes stood 
out from their sockets his dark hair waved in the beams of the setting sun 

 ha ha the shout burst from his lips here is blood warm warm 
aye warm and gushing is that the murmur of a brook is that the whisper 
of a breeze is that the song of a bird no no but still it is music that 
gushing of the wronger s blood deeply wronged mary deeply darkly 
wronged but fully avenged mary aye to the last drop of his blood 
have you no music there i would dance yes yes i would dance over the 
corse ha ha ha not the sound of the organ that is too dark and 
gloomy but the drum the trumpet the chorus of full band fill heaven 
and earth with joy for in sight of god and his angels i would dance over 
the corse while a wild song of joy fills the heavens a sug h tza a 
song and the chorus mark ye how it swells huzza 

 this this is the vengeance of a brother 



the conclusion 

in a deep forest wild a maiden form bent over a spring of clear xgtd water 
which bubbled upward from among a mass of green leaves near the foot of 
a giant oak she bent down on the velvet moss while the green leaves of 
shrubbery encircling her on every side and the thick branches of trees meet 
ing over-head in a canopy of verdure made the place seem like fairy bowef 
of some olden story 

she bent down over the spring not with a cup or a goblet in her hand 
but with a white lily trembling in her delicate fingers as its petals dipped 
gently into the waters those waters so clear so cold so tranquil reflected 
the outlines of a fair young face the gleam of two mild blue eyes the grace 
ful flow of light brown hair tossed gently on the summer air as she gazed 
intohhis living mirror a single ray of sunlight fell quivering from the canopy 
overhead and trembled on the bosom of the spring while a smile stole over 
the maiden s face it was a smile but sad and mournful as a knell it was a 
smile but gloomy as a sunbeam falling over the grave of youth and beauty 

suddenly the maiden uprose from her kneeling posture she placed the 
rily on her bosom and with a light step threaded the mazes of a winding path 
that led around the trunks of colossal trees over the softly tufted moss and 
beneath the shade of leafy branches now the strain of some wild and 
melancholy song burst from her lips and now with her blue eyes upturned 
she gazed vacantly upon a glimpse of the blue heavens murmuring strange 
words to herself all the while again she bounded on her way until dash 
ing a mass of green leaves aside she stood upon the brow of a gentle hill 
with the summer wind playing among her dark brown tresses while her blue 
eyes shone with a calm and holy delight 

a calm sheet of water embosomed in the crest of the mountain with banks 
high and rugged clothed with forest trees or gentle and sloping crowned 
with soft and luxuriant shrubbery a calm sheet of water with its stainless 
depths resting in the smile of the summer sky like a sleeping child beneath 
its mother s gaze such was the vision that burst on the delighted eye of 
the maiden while her ears were soothed by the melody of the wood-bird s 
song mingling with the murmur of a brooklet echoing from the bosom of 
the shrubbery around the foot of the knoll as it sank gently into the waters 
of the mountain lake 

the maiden gazed upon this scene ralm loveliness while a mournful 
expression stole over her face as thougn some memory of the past came 
sadly to her soul 

arising from the centre of a fair garden that bloomed ovr the slope of 
glacie declining gently to the water s brink a cottage over-snadowed by

the conclusion 

grove of forest trees with vines trailing round its arching windows and 
winding walks leading down to the lake broke on the maiden s eye like 
a vision of a happy home reared by the hands of love in the solitude of the 
wilderness the cottage two stories in height with arching windows and a 
steep gabled roof arose from a flowery knoll not more than a hundred yards 
from the spot where the maiden stood v a wj m 

the faint yellow hue of the cottage walls was in beautiful contrast with 
the verdure of the vines trailing round its windows the deep green of the 
branches waving above its roof the brown gravelled paths of the garden 
or the beds of flowers scattered all around with the sunbeams gleaming 
over rose and lily as they waved gently to the summer air 

suddenly the sound of footsteps came faintly to the maiden s ear 
turning toward the forest she beheld two forms advancing along a wide 
gravelled walk which sloped down toward the knoll with the interwoven 
branches forming a verdant arch overhead a fair girl supported the arm 
of an aged woman whose tall form clad in deep black was in strong con 
trast with the light figure at her side also attired in robes of sable they 
came slowly along the walk they perceived the form of the maiden clad 
in light robes in a moment they reached her side 

 we have lost our way in the forest miss cried the aged lady gazbg 
upon the beautiful face of the girl with an expression of wonder mingled 
with admiration in company with a party of our friends we left the val 
ley of wyoming this morning with the intention of enjoying the free air of 
these mountains but having missed our friends we are forced to ask you 
to direct us to the wood which leads from the forest 

the maiden in robes of white made no reply her blue eyes were en- 
chained by the face of the maiden who accompanied the aged lady with 
slow footsteps she advanced to her side she laid her hands gently on her 
shoulders and with a wild gaze perused each feature of her beautiful coun 
tenance she was indeed beautiful as a dream waving tresses of auburn 
hair mingling the purple dyes of sunset with the deep black of midnight 
relieved a fair countenance whose pale brow was impressed with an expres 
sion of deep sadness whose dark hazel eyes were full of thoughtful sorrow 

there they stood gazing in each other s faces these two images of youth 
and loveliness while the aged dame looked from countenance to counte 
nance with an expression of mute wonder 

the free sunbeams and the glad summer air came through the windows 
of the cottage in a small room furnished in a style of neatness combined 
with taste sate a man in the prime of early manhood his form was thrown 
listlessly in a large arm chair while his arms were lightly folded across 
his chest his high forehead was rendered deathly pale by the ebon 
blackness of his hair which fell in thick masses down to his shoulders 
his dark eyes dilating with an expression of intense thought glared steadily 



 

i the conclusion 

in the air while his nether lip quivered with a tremulous motion hi 
countenance was pale yet it was not the pallor of disease but of long deep 
and absorbing thought and as a stray sunbeam fell over his brow or as 
his black hair was tossed aside from his face by an occasional breath of 
wind low-muttered words broke from his lips words fraught with many a 
bitter memory or dear hope of the by-gone time 

while he sits there in that silent room wrapt in strange thought we will 
glance at the contents of a newspaper that lay among some books and let 
ters on the table by his side

lous charge originated by some designing enemies she was acquitted bj 
the jury without leaving the box 

 the dead body of a woman was found on last thursday in the 

graveyard of l in this state the corpse when discovered was 

laying beside the grave of mr walraven once a highly respectable citizen 
of the town but now some years deceased the unknown female was 
dressed in deep black her hair was very dark and her face retained some 
tokens of former beauty having no friends to claim her corse she was 
buried in the graveyard of the county poorhouse 

in an obscure corner of the paper crowded up among a multitude of ad 
vertisements was the following brief and expressive postscript 

 the villian who perpetrated the wholesale forgery on several houses in 
new york charleston and new orleans was arrested last night just be 
fore our paper went to press he was taken to new york under care of 
the police heavily ironed in order to baulk any effort to escape he proves 
to be no less a personage than the notorious algernon fitz-cowles who 
has been displaying himself in chesnut street for a year or two past 
 

we also learn from the best authority that one of our first clergymen has 
been guilty of a most daring and atrocious act of perfidy as the case will 
shortly be brought to trial we refrain from giving the particulars suffice 
to say that the victim is the daughter of one of our wealthiest merchants 
the heartless seducer none other than the reverend doctor f a t pyne 
author of several works on the iniquities of the pope etc etc etc 

while the record of human weakness wretchedness and crime lay flut 
tering on the table the head of the young man drooped slowly down until 
his face rested on his folded arms there was a world of meaning in the 
steady gaze of his dilating eye which glared beneath his woven brows 

the silence of the room was scarcely broken by the opening of the door 
a beautiful woman advanced with a softened footstep and stole gently 
to the back of the chair her clustering hair fell in thick tresses of 
gold aside from a mild countenance or whose fair outlines were written 
the tenderness of a mother the deep and abiding love of a wife in her 
extended arms she held a sweet and laughing child whose tiny fingers 
wandered playfully through the dark locks of the father s hair 

and there in that quiet parlor sate the man of the pallid brow with his 
face drooped on his folded arms wrapt in deep and terrible thought while 
at the back of his chair leaning over his downcast head was the form of a 
fair and lovely woman with a laughing babe in her extended hands 

 byrnewood whispered the soft voice of the wife 

he raised his head he beheld the beaming countenance of his wife the 
bughing face of his child 



 the conclusion 

 annie he whispered while a smile of pleasure warmed over hn 
pale face 

he rose from his seat but that smile was gone the dark thought was 
on his soul again he turned from his wife and child toward the door of 
that chamber from which he never emerged without a flashing eye and 
and gloomy brow 

 oh byrnewood do not enter that chamber to day said the soft plead 
ing voice of his wife i have never sought to know the secret of that 
dreary place i have never crossed its threshold but this i know that 
you are always dark and gloomy after you have spent but a moment 
within its walls do not enter the chamber to day byrnewood do not i 
beseech you 

 this day annie for the last time said byrnewood as he took the 
key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock after to-day that room 
shall never make me sad or gloomy 

with a melancholy smile he opened the door passed into the chamber and 
closed it again it was a small and narrow room with a plain carpet on the 
floor a table standing in one corner and an arching window opening on the 
lake through the half closed curtains of this window came the warm sun 
shine the cool air and a glimpse of the clear waters the deep forests and 
fragrant flowers 

in the centre of the wall opposite the door a long curtain of dark velvet 
hung drooping from the ceiling to the floor byrnewood stood opposite this 
curtain with his arms sternly folded on his breast while a fearful ration 
convulsed each lineament of his expressive countenance 

 ha i remember it well he muttered i remember it well there 
there i stood with the gaze of the callous mob fixed upon my face the stern 
visages of the jury and the iron countenance of the judge these were all 
before me i stood in the presence of my fate 

there too were the lawyers full of craft and cunning they had antici 
pated long speeches ingenious pleas knotty points of law ha ha how i 
baulked them all i remember it yet plead not guilty whispered my 
lawyer i smiled in my heart i knew his plan he would clear me from 
the gibbet or the gaol by the paltry plea of insanity insane when my 
soul was firm as its own despair when my hand was true as the weapon it 
grasped guilty or not guilty whined the clerk 

 guilty i shouted rising to my feet while my lawyers started up 
with dismay guilty in the sight of god i am charged with this man s 
murder i did murder him yes yes as a dog should die he died i had 
a fair and stainless sister gentlemen my grey-haired father had a pure and 
innocent daughter on that daughter s happiness hung the life of a trupu 
heartod mother yes yes your honor that daughter was the hope and 
joy of three persons a father a mother a brother and each of these would 
have given their life for her 



the conclusion 

 a libertine came he lured this girl from her home he perjured his soul 
that he might betray her he did betray her betrayed polluted dishonored 
she returned to her father s house 

 and think ye that there was no brother to avenge her wrong ha 
ha there was a brother he pursued the libertine he overtook the cra 
ven in his guilty flight calling on the high god to nerve his arm and 
send the bullet home he shot the libertine as in the flush of triumphan 
guilt he stood glorying in his crime not guilty ha ha i am guilty 
i am the murderer i shot the libertine and would shoot him again now 
gentlemen convict me if you can now your honor pass sentence of death 
upon me if you can 

 here i rest my defence on this i peril life and honor he wronged 
my sister and he died 

 how that glad shout rung through the court house not guilty i was 
free 

as this wild soliloquy trembled from his lips in broken murmurs he tore 
aside the velvet drapery and a portrait was revealed it was the portrait of 
gustavus lorrimer strolling into the studio of a celebrated artist byrne- 
wood had seen this picture and having ascertained that it was a copy of a 
portrait painted for lorrimer a month before his death he purchased it and 
brought it to his mountain retreat among the wilds of wyoming there was 
the same laughing face of manly beauty the same dark hazel eye the scorn 
ful lip with its dark mustache the flowing locks of dark brown hair there 
vas the portrait gleaming in the light of the sun while the handsome gus 
lorrimer lay rotting in his grave six feet below the glad earth smiling in 
ihe summer sun 

the avenger knew that he was right in the sight of god in the execution 
of the fearful deed which had been death to the libertine but still there was 
one thought never absent from his soul at his board on his pillow in the 
walk through the wild wood or the crowded city the face of lorrimer was 
ever with him he found an awful pleasure in contemplating the portrait 
of the libertine he had avenged his sister s wrong but the memory of the 
scenes he had witnessed in monk-hall in the parlor of his father s house in 
the streets of the quaker city or on the broad river dwelt like a shadow on 
his soul 

while byrnewood arlington stood gazing intently upon the portrait the 
door slowly opened and three figures entered the room his reverie was 
deep and absorbing he did not hear the sound of the opening door nor the 
tread of footsteps an aged dame clad in deep black a fair young girl in 
robes white as snow and a maiden attired in sable with auburn hair floating 
along each youthful cheek these all unknown and unperceived stood ai the 
brother s side 

u ha he cried with a sudden start as he perceived the intruders mary 
have i not told you never to cross that threshold 



the conclusion 

his words were drowned in the wild shriek that quivered on each lin 
they beheld the portrait they sank kneeling on the floor 

 my child shrieked the dame and she clasped her hands in silent agony 

 my brother cried the maiden in black and she buried her face in her 
bosom while her auburn hair floated over her trembling hands 

the girl in robes of flowing white knelt on the floor with her eyes so full 
of unutterable feeling centered on the portrait her cheek flushed with strange 
emotions and her clasped hands raised on high a single word burst from 
her lips a single word uttered in a whisper like the sigh of a broken heart

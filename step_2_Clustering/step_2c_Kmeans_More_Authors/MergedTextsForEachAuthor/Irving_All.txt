master simon has a most devout abhorrence
mingled with awe for this ancient spinster he
told me the other day in a whisper that she was
a cursed brimstone in fact he added another
epithet which i would not repeat for the world
i have remarked however that he is always
extremely civil to her when they meet

 hunting
on the skirts the neighbouring village there
lives a kind small potentate who for aught i
know is a representative one the most ancient
legitimate lines the present day for the
empire over which he reigns has belonged to his
family time out mind his territories comprise
a considerable number good fat acres
and his seat power is in an old farm house
where he enjoys unmolested the stout oaken
chair his ancestors the personage to whom
 ready money jack
i allude is a sturdy old yeoman the name 
john tibbets or rather ready money jack
tibbets as he is called throughout the neighbourhood

the first place where he attracted my attention
was in the churchyard on sunday where
he sat on a tombstone after the service with his
hat a little on one side holding forth to a small
circle auditors and as i presumed expounding
the law and the prophets until on drawing
a little nearer i found he was only expatiating
on the merits a brown horse he presented
such a picture a substantial english yeoman
as he is often described in books mingled with
some little finery peculiar to himself that i
could not but take note his whole appearance

he was between fifty and sixty a strong
muscular frame and at least six feet high with
a physiognomy as grave as a lion's and set off
with short curling iron gray locks his shirt
collar was turned down and displayed a neck
covered with the same short curling hair and he
ready money jack 
wore a coloured silk neckcloth tied very loosely
and tucked in at the bosom with a green paste
broach on the knot his coat was dark green
cloth with silver buttons on each which was engraved
a stag with his own name john tibbets
underneath he had an inner waistcoat figured
chintz between which and his coat was another
 scarlet cloth unbuttoned his breeches
were also left unbuttoned at the knees not from
any slovenliness but to show a broad pair scarlet
garters his stockings were blue with white
clocks he wore large silver shoe buckles a
broad paste buckle in his hat band his sleeve buttons
were gold seven shilling pieces and he had
two or three guineas hanging as ornaments to his
watch chain
on making some inquiries about him i gathered
that he was descended from a line farmers
that had always lived on the same spot and
owned the same property and that half the
churchyard was taken up with the tombstones 
his race he has all his life been an important
character in the place when a youngster he
 ready money jack
was one the most roaring blades the neighbourhood
no one could match him at wrestling
pitching the bar cudgel play and other athletic
exercises like the renowned pinner 
wakefield he was the village champion carried
off the prizes at all the fairs and threw his gauntlet
at the country round even to this day the
old people talk his prowess and undervalue
in comparison all heroes the green that have
succeeded him nay they say that if ready
money jack were to take the field even now
there is no one could stand before him
when jack's father died the neighbours shook
their heads and predicted that young hopeful
would soon make way with the old homestead 
but jack falsified all their predictions the
moment he succeeded to the paternal farm he
assumed a new character took a wife attended
resolutely to his affairs and became an industrious
thrifty farmer with the family property
he inherited a set old family maxims to which
he steadily adhered he saw to every thing
himself put his own hand to the plough workready
money jack 
ed hard eat heartily slept soundly paid for
every thing in cash down and never danced except
he could do it to the music his own money
in both pockets he has never been without
a hundred or two pounds in golden guineas by
him and never allows a debt to stand against
him this has gained him his current name 
which by the bye he is a little proud and has
caused him to be looked upon as a very wealthy
man by all the village
notwithstanding his thrift however he has
never denied himself the amusements life 
but has taken a share in every passing pleasure
it is his maxim that he that works hard can
afford to play he is therefore an attendant
at all the country fairs and wakes and has signalized
himself by feats strength and prowess
on every village green in the shire he often
makes his appearance at horse races and sports
his half guinea and even his guinea at a time 
keeps a good horse for his own riding and to
this day is fond following the hounds and is
generally in at the death he keeps up the rusvol
i 
 ready money jack
tic revels and hospitalities too for which his
paternal farm house has always been noted has
plenty good cheer and dancing at harvest home
and above all keeps the merry night as it is
termed at christmas
with all his love amusement jack is by no
means a boisterous jovial companion he is
seldom known to laugh in the midst his gayety 
but maintains the same lionlike demeanour
he is very slow at comprehending a joke and
is apt to sit puzzling at it with a perplexed look
while the rest the company are in a roar
this gravity has perhaps grown on him with the
growing weight his character for he is gradually
growing into patriarchal dignity in his
native place though he no longer takes an
active part in athletic sports yet he always presides
at them and is appealed to on all occasions
as umpire he maintains the peace on the vilmerry
night a rustic merry making in a farm house about
christmas there is abundance homely fare tea cakes fruit and
ale various feats agility amusing games romping dancing and
kissing withal they commonly break up at midnight
ready money jack 
lage green at holyday games and quells all
brawls and quarrels by collaring the parties and
shaking them heartily if refractory no one
ever pretends to raise a hand against him or to
contend against his decisions the young men
having grown up in habitual awe his prowess
and in implicit deference to him as the champion
and lord the green
he is a regular frequenter the village tavern
 the landlady having been a sweetheart 
his in early life and he having always continued
on kind terms with her he seldom however
drinks any thing but a draught ale smokes
his pipe and pays his reckoning before leaving
the bar room here he gives his little senate
laws decides bets which are generally referred
to him determines upon the characters and
qualities horses and indeed plays now and
then the part a judge in settling petty disputes
between neighbours which otherwise might
have been nursed by country attorneys into tolerable
lawsuits jack is very candid and impartial
in his decisions but he has not a head to carse
ready money jack
ry a long argument and is very apt to get perplexed
and out patience if there is much pleading
he generally breaks through the argument
with a strong voice and brings matters to a
summary conclusion by pronouncing what he
calls the upshot the business or in other
words the long and the short the matter
jack once made a journey to london a great
many years since which has furnished him with
topics conversation ever since he saw the
old king on the terrace at windsor who stopped
and pointed him out to one the princesses
being probably struck with jack's truly yeomanlike
appearance this is a favourite anecdote
with him and has no doubt had a great effect in
making him a most loyal subject ever since in
spite taxes and poor's rates he was also at
bartholomew fair where he had half the buttons
cut off his coat and a gang pickpockets attracted
by his external show gold and silver
made a regular attempt to hustle him as he was
gazing at a show but for once they found that
they had caught a tartar for jack enacted as
ready money jack 
great wonders among the gang as samson did
among the philistines one his neighbours
who had accompanied him to town and was
with him at the fair brought back an account
 his exploits which raised the pride the
whole village who considered their champion
as having subdued all london and eclipsed the
achievements friar tuck or even the renowned
robin hood himself
 late years the old fellow has seemed to
take things more easily works less and indulges
in greater leisure his son having grownup
and succeeded to him both in the labours 
the farm and the exploits the green like
all sons distinguished men however his father's
renown is a disadvantage to him he can
never come up to public expectation though
a fine active fellow threeandtwenty and
quite the cock the walk yet the old people
declare he is nothing like what ready money
jack was at his time life the youngster
himself acknowledges his inferiority and
has a wonderful opinion the old man who
 ready money jack
indeed taught him all his athletic accomplishments
and holds such a sway over him that i
am told even to this day he would have no
hesitation to take him in hands if he rebelled
against paternal government
the squire holds jack in very high esteem
and shows him to all his visitors as a specimen
 old english heart oak he frequently
calls at his house and tastes some his home
brewed which is excellent he made jack a
present old tusser's hundredth points 
good husbandry which has furnished him with
reading ever since and is his text and manual
in all agricultural and domestic concerns
he has made dog's ears at the most favourite
passages and knows many the poetical maxims
by heart
tibbets though not a man to be daunted or
fluttered by high acquaintances and though he
cherishes a sturdy independence mind and
manner yet is evidently gratified by the attentions
 the squire whom he has known from
boyhood and pronounces a true gentleman
ready money jack 
every inch him he is also on excellent
terms with master simon who is a kind privy
counsellor to the family but his great favourite
is the oxonian whom he taught to wrestle and
play at quarterstaff when a boy and considers
the most promising young gentleman in the
whole county
bachelors
the bachelor most joyfully
in pleasant plight doth pass his daies 
good fellowship and companie
he doth maintain and kepe always
evans old ballads
there is no character in the comedy human
life that is more difficult to play well than
that an old bachelor when a single gentleman
therefore arrives at that critical period when
he begins to consider it an impertinent question
be asked his age i would advise him to look
well to his ways this period it is true is much
later with some men than with others i have
witnessed more than once the meeting two
wrinkled old lads this kind who had not seen
each other for several years and have been
amused by the amicable exchange compliments
on each other's appearance that takes
bachelors 
place on such occasions there is always one
invariable observation why bless my soul 
you look younger than when last i saw you 
whenever a man's friends begin to compliment
him about looking young he may be sure that
they think he is growing old
i am led to make these remarks by the conduct
 master simon and the general who have
become great cronies as the former is the
youngest by many years he is regarded as quite
a youthful blade by the general who moreover
looks upon him as a man great wit and prodigious
acquirements i have already hinted
that master simon is a family beau and considered
rather a young fellow by all the elderly ladies
 the connexion for an old bachelor in an old
family connexion is something like an actor ina
regular company who seems to flourish in
immortal youth and will continue to play the
romeos and rangers for half a century together
master simon too is a little the camelion
and takes a different hue with every different
companion he is very attentive and courteous
vol i 
 bachelors
and somewhat sentimental with lady lillycraft 
copies out little namby namby ditties and love
songs for her and draws quivers and doves and
darts and cupids to be worked on the corners
 her pocket handkerchiefs he indulges however
in very considerable latitude with the other
married ladies the family and has many sly
pleasantries to whisper to them that provoke an
equivocal laugh and a tap the fan but when
he gets among the young company such as
frank bracebridge the oxonian and the general
he is apt to put on the madwag and to talk
in a very bachelorlike strain about the sex
in this he has been encouraged by the example
 the general whom he looks up to as a
man the ton that has seen the world the
general in fact tells shocking stories after dinner
when the ladies are gone which he gives as
some the choice things that are served up at
a knot bon vivants in london called the mule
club he also repeats a great many
fat jokes old major slings the wit the
dub which the general can hardly relate for
bachelors 
laughing though they always make the squire
look grave who has a great antipathy to a bawdy
jest in a word the general is a complete instance
 that declension in gay life by which a
young man pleasure is apt to cool down into
an obscene old gentleman
i saw him and master simon an evening or
two since conversing with a buxom milkmaid ina
meadow and from their elbowing each other
now and then and the general's shaking his
shoulders blowing up his cheeks and breaking
out into a short fit irrepressible laughter i had
no doubt that they were playing the mischief
with the girl
as i looked at them through a hedge i could
not but think they would have made a tolerable
group for a modern picture susanna and the
two elders it is true the girl seemed in no wise
alarmed at the force the enemy and i question
had either them been alone whether she
would not have been more than they would have
ventured to encounter such veteran oysters
are daring wags when together and will put
 bachelors
any female to the blush with their jokes but they
are as quiet as lambs when they fall singly into
the clutches a fine woman
in spite the general's years he evidently
is a little vain his person and ambitious 
conquests i have observed him on sunday in
church eying the country girls most suspiciously
and have even seen him leer upon them with a
downright amorous look even when he has been
gallantry lady lillycraft with great ceremony
through the churchyard the general in fact
is a veteran in the service cupid rather than
mars having signalized himself in all the garrison
towns and country quarters and seen service
in every ball room england not a celebrated
beauty but he has laid siege to and if his
word may be taken in a matter wherein no man
is apt to be veracious it is incredible the success
he has had with the fair at present he is like a
wornout warrior retired from service but who
still cocks his beaver with a military air and
talks stoutly fighting whenever he comes
within the smell gunpowder
bachelors 
i have heard him speak his mind very freely
over his bottle about the folly the captain intaking
a wife as he thinks a young soldier should
care for nothing but his bottle and kind landlady
 but in fact he says the service on the
continent has played the mischief with the young
men they have been ruined by light wines and
french quadrilles they've nothing he says 
the spirit the old service there are none 
your sixbottle men left that were the souls a
mess dinner and used to play the very deuce
among the women
as to a bachelor the general affirms that he
is a free and easy man with no baggage to take
care but his portmanteau but a married
man with his wife hanging on his arm always
puts him in mind a chamber candlestick with
its extinguisher hitched to it
i should not mind all this if it were merelyconfined
to the general but i fear he will bethe
ruin my friend master simon who already
begins to echo his heresies and to talk in the
style a gentleman that has seen life and
 bachelors
lived upon the town indeed he seems to have
taken master simon in hand and talks showing
him the lions in london next season and 
introducing him to the mulligatawney club ashe
is continually quoting the sayings this
club i have been curious to learn something
about it i find it is composed a knot old
nabobs officers and other choice spirits that
have seen service in india and been burnt outwith
curry and touched with the liver complaint
they meet regularly to eat mulligatawney soup
smoke the hookah talk about tippoo saib
and seringapatam and be tediously agreeable
in each others company
wives
believe me man there is no greater bliss
than is the quiet joy loving wife
which whoso wants half himselfe doth miss
friend without change playfellow without strife
food without fulness counsaile without strife
is this sweet doubling our single life
sir p sidney
it is a great pity that plays and novels should
always at the wedding and should not give
us another act and another volume to let us
know how the hero and heroine conducted themselves
when married their main object seems
to be to instruct young ladies how to get husbands
 but not how to keep them now this last
it appears to me is a desideratum in modem
married life it is appalling to those who have
not yet ventured into the state to see how soon
the flame romantic love burns out or is quenched
wives
ed in matrimony and the passionate poetic lover
declines into the phlegmatic prosaic husband
i am inclined to attribute this very much
to the defect i have just mentioned in the plays
and novels which form the principal study our
young ladies and which teach them how to be
heroines but leave them totally at a loss when
they come to be wives i have lately however
met with an exception to this practice in an old
writer who has bravely attempted to support
dramatic interest in favour a woman even after
she was married i was looking over an
album the fair julia's when i found a series
 poetical extracts in the squire's handwriting
which might have been intended as matrimonial
advice to his ward i was so much struck with
the beauty several them that i took the
liberty making a copy they are from the
old play the city nightcap in which is
drawn out and exemplified in the part abates
a character a patient and faithful wife 
by thomas davenport 
wives 
which i think might vie with that the renowned
griselda though i fear it would stand almost
as little chance being adopted as a model
the following is a commendation her to
her husband lorenzo 
she's modest but not sullen and loves silence
not that she wants apt words for when she speaks
she inflames love with wonder but because
she calls wise silence the soul's harmony
she's truly chaste yet such a foe to coyness
the poorest call her courteous and which is excellent
though fair and young she shuns to expose herself
to the opinion strange eyes she either seldom
or never walks abroad but in your company j
and then with such sweet bashfulness as if
she were venturing on crack'd ice and takes delight
to step into the print your foot hath made
and will follow you whole fields so she will drive
tediousness out time with her sweet character
notwithstanding all this excellence abstemious
the misfortune to incur the unmerited jealousy
 her husband instead however resenting
his harsh treatment with clamorous upbraiding
and the stormy violence high windy
virtue by which the sparks anger are so often
blown into a flame she endures it with the
meekness conscious but patient virtue and
vol i 
 wives
makes a beautiful appeal to a friend who has
witnessed her long suffering 
hast thou not seen me
bear all his injuries as the ocean suffers
the angry bark to plough thorough her bosom
and yet is presently so smooth the eye
cannot perceive where the wide wound was made
lorenzo being wrought on by false representations
at length repudiates her to the last
however she maintains her patient sweetness
and her love for him in spite his cruelty she
deplores his error even more than his unkindness
and laments the delusion which has turned his
very affection into a source bitterness there
is a moving pathos in her parting address to lorenzo
after their divorce 
farewell lorenzo
whom my soul doth love if you e'er marry
may you meet a good wife so good that you
may not suspect her nor may she be worthy
 your suspicion and if you hear hereafter
that i am dead inquire but my last words
and you shall know that to the last i lov'd you
and when you walk forth with your second choice
into the pleasant fields and by chance talk me
imagine that you see me lean and pale
wives 
strewing your path with flowers
but may she never live to pay my debts weeps
if but in thought she wrong you may she die
in the conception the injury
pray make me wealthy with one kiss farewell sir 
let it not grieve you when you shall remember
that i was innocent nor this forget
though innocence here suffer sigh and groan
she walks but thorow thorns to find a throne
in a short time lorenzo discovers his error 
and the innocence his injured wife in the
transports his repentance he calls to mind all
her feminine excellence her gentle uncomplaining
womanly fortitude under wrongs and sorrows

oh abstemia 
how lovely thou loosest now now thou appeared
chaster than is the morning's modesty
that rises with blush over whose bosom
the western wind creeps softly now i remember
how when she sat at table her obedient eye
would dwell on mine as if it were not well
unless it looked when i looked oh how proud
she was when she could cross herself to please me 
but where now is this fair soul like a silver cloud
she hath wept herself i fear into the dead sea
and will be found no more
 
it is but doing right by the reader if interested
in the fate abstemia by the preceding
 wives
extracts to say that she was restored to the
arms and affections her husband rendered
fonder than ever by that disposition in every
good heart to atone for past injustice by an
overflowing measure returning kindness 
the wealth worth more than kingdoms i am now
confirmed past all suspicion thou art far
sweeter in thy sincere truth than a sacrifice
decked up for death with garlands the indian winds
that blow from off the coast and cheer the sailor
with the sweet savour their spices want
the delight flows in thee
i have been more affected and interested by
this little dramatic picture than by many a
popular love tale though as i said before i do
not think it likely either abstemia or patient
grizzle stand much chance being taken fora
model still i like to see poetry now and then
extending its views beyond the wedding day and
teaching a lady how to make herself attractive
even after marriage
there is no great need enforcing on an unmarried
lady the necessity being agreeable 
wives 
nor is there any great art requisite in a youthful
beauty to enable her to please nature has multiplied
attractions round her youth is in itself
attractive the freshness budding beauty
needs no foreign aid to set it off it pleases merely
because it is fresh and budding and beautiful
but it is for the married state that a woman
needs the most instruction and in which she
should be most on her guard to maintain her
powers pleasing no woman can expect
to be to her husband all that he fancied her
when he was a lover men are always doomed
to be duped not so much by the arts the sex
as by their own imaginations they are always
wooing goddesses and marrying mere mortals
a woman should therefore ascertain what was
the charm that rendered her so fascinating when
a girl and endeavour to keep it up when she has
become a wife one great thing undoubtedly
was the chariness herself and her conduct
which an unmarried female always observes
she should maintain the same niceness and re
 wives
serve in her person and habits and endeavour
still to preserve a freshness and virgin delicacy
in the eye her husband she should remember
that the province woman is to be wooed
not to woo to be caressed not to caress man
is an ungrateful being in love bounty loses instead
 winning him the secret a woman's
power does not consist so much in giving as in
withholding a woman may give up too much
even to her husband it is to a thousand little
delicacies conduct that she must trust to keep
alive passion and to protect herself from that
dangerous familiarity that thorough acquaintance
with every weakness and imperfection incident
to matrimony by these means she may still
maintain her power though she has surrendered
her person and may continue the romance 
love even beyond the honey moon
she that hath a wise husband says jeremy
taylor must entice him to an eternal dearness
by the veil modesty and the grave robes
 chastity the ornament meekness and the
wives 
jewels faith and charity she must have no
painting but blushing her brightness must be
purity and she must shine round about with
sweetness and friendship and she shall be
pleasant while she lives and desired when she
dies
 v
i have wandered into a rambling series remarks
on a trite subject and a dangerous one fora
bachelor to meddle with that i may not
however appear to confine my observations entirely
to the wife i will conclude with another
quotation from jeremy taylor in which the
duties both parties are mentioned while i
would recommend his sermon on the marriage
ring to all those who wiser than myself are
about entering the happy state wedlock
there is scarce any matter duty but it
concerns them both alike and is only distinguished
by names and hath its variety by circumstances
and little accidents and what in one is
called love in the other is called reverence and
what in the wife is obedience the same in the
 wives
man is duty he provides and she dispenses 
he gives commandments and she rules by them 
he rules her by authority and she rules him by
love she ought by all means to please him and
he must by no means displease her
a literary antiquary
printed books he contemn as a novelty this latter age but a
manuscript he pores on everlastingly especially if the cover be all
motheaten and the dust make a parenthesis between every syllable
mlcocosmographie 
in the account my christmas visit to the
hall i made some mention the parson who
is a kind family chaplain to the squire and
was his chum at oxford a farther acquaintance
with the little man has increased my esteem
for him he is a scholar without arrogance
or pedantry very ignorant the world
having lived almost entirely among books and
those too old books so that his mind is as antiquated
as the squire's garden where one
finds formal flower beds and peacocks cut in
yew
his taste for literary antiquities was first imbibed
when a student at oxford where he
vol i 
 a literary antiquary
spent the chief his leisure hours in the bodleian
library foraging among the old manuscripts

in the course his life he has visited most
 the curious libraries in england and has
ransacked many the cathedrals though in
general quiet and rather dry yet on his favourite
theme he kindles up and becomes almost
eloquent no fox hunter relating his last day's
sport could be more animated than i have seen
the worthy parson when relating his search
after a curious document which he had traced
from library to library until he fairly earthed
it in the dusty chapter house a cathedral
when too he describes some venerable manuscript
with its rich illuminations its thick
creamy vellum its glossy ink and the odour
 the cloisters that seems to exhale from it
he rivals the enthusiasm a parisian epicure
expatiating on the merits a pate de strasbourg
he has a great desire however to
read works in the old libraries and chapter
houses to which they belong for he thinks a
a literary antiquary 
black letter volume reads best in one these
old chambers where the light struggles through
dusty lancet windows and painted glass and
that it loses half its zest if taken away from the
neighbourhood the curiously carved oaken
 case and gothic reading desk
the parson i am told has been for a longtime
meditating a commentary on struts brand
and douce in which he means to detect them
in sundry dangerous errors with respect to popular
games and superstitions he is also a
casual contributor to that long established
repository national customs and antiquities
the gentleman's magazine and is one those
that every now and then make an inquiry concerning
some obsolete custom or rare legend 
nay it is said that several his communications
have been at least six inches in length
he frequently receives parcels by coach
from different parts the kingdom containing
mouldy volumes and almost illegible manuscripts
it is singular what an active correspondence
is kept up among literary antiquaries
 a literary antiquary
and how soon the fame any rare volume or
unique copy just discovered among the rubbish
 a library is circulated among them the
parson is more busy than common just now
being a little flurried by an advertisement a
work preparing for the press on the mythology
 the middle ages the little man has long
been gathering together all the hobgoblin tales
he could collect illustrative the superstitions
 former times and he is in a complete fever
lest this formidable rival should take the field
before him shortly after my arrival at the
hall i called at the parsonage in company
with mr bracebridge and the general the
parson had not been seen for several days
which was a matter some surprise as he
was an almost daily visiter at the hall we
found him in his study a small dusky chamber
lighted by a lattice window that looked into the
church yard and was overshadowed by a yew
tree his chair was surrounded by folios and
quartos piled upon the floor and his table was
covered with books and manuscripts the
a literary antiquary 
cause his seclusion was a work which he
had recently received and with which he had
retired in rapture from the world and shut himself
up to enjoy a literary honey moon undisturbed
never did boarding school girl devour
the pages a sentimental novel or don quixote
a chivalrous romance with more intense delight
than did the little man banquet on the
pages this delicious work it was dibdin's
bibliographical tour a work calculated to have
as powerful an effect on the imaginations literary
antiquaries as the tales the early
american adventurers had on the spanish
dons filling them with dreams mexican
and peruvian mines and the golden realm
 el dorado
the good parson had long been looking forward
to the fruits this bibliographical crusade 
which had far greater importance in his eyes
than the expeditions to africa or the north pole
the work had realized all his anticipations
he had been transported in idea to the libraries
 the old german convents and universities 
 a literary antiquary
his mind's eye had feasted on vellum manuscripts
and exquisitely illuminated missals his brain
was haunted with lovesick dreams about gorgeous
old works in silk linings triple gold
bands and tinted leather locked up in wire
cases and secured from the vulgar hands the
mere reader and to continue the happy expressions
 an ingenious w r river dazzling
one's eyes like eastern beauties peering through
their jealousies
when the parson had finished a rapturous
eulogy on this most curious and entertaining
work he drew forth from a little drawer a
manuscript lately received from a correspondent
which had perplexed him sadly it was written
in norman french in very ancient characters
and so faded and smouldered away as to be almost
illegible it was apparently an old norman
drinking song that might have been brought
over by one william the conqueror's carousing
followers the writing was just legible
disraeli's curiosities literature
a literary antiquary ill
enough to keep a keen antiquity hunter on a
doubtful chace here and there would be a few
words so plainly written as to put him on the
scent again in this way he had been led on
for a whole day until he had found himself completely
at fault
the squire endeavoured to assist him but
was equally baffled the old general listened
for some time to the discussion and then asked
the parson if he had read captain morris or
george stevens or anacreon moore's bacchanalian
songs on the other's replying in the negative
 oh then said the general with infinite
bon homme if you want a drinking song
i can furnish you with the latest collection
i did not know you had a turn for those kind 
things and i can lend you the encyclopaedia
 wit into the bargain i never travel without
them they're excellent reading at an inn
it would be difficult to describe the odd look
 surprise and perplexity the parson on
this proposal or the difficulty that the squire
had in making the general comprehend that
 a literary antiquary
though a jovial song the present day was
totally abhorrent to the ears wisdom and
beneath the notice a learned man yet a
trowel written by a tosspot several hundred
years since was a matter worthy the gravest
research and enough to set whole colleges by
the ears
the farm house
love and hay
are thick sown but come up full thistles
beaumont and fletcher
i was so much pleased with the anecdotes
which were told me ready money jack gibbets
that i got master simon a day or two since
to take me to his house it was an old fashioned
farm house built brick with curiously twisted
chimneys it stood at a little distance from the
road with a southern exposure looking upon a
soft green slope meadow there was a small
garden in front with a row beehives humming
among beds sweet herbs and flowers
well scoured milking tubs with bright copper
hoops hung on the garden paling fruit trees
were trained up against the cottage and pots 
vol i 
 the farm house
flowers stood in the windows a fat superannuated
mastiff lay in the sunshine at the door 
with a sleek cat sleeping peacefully across him
tibbets was from home at the time our
calling but we were received with hearty and
homely welcome by his wife a notable motherly
woman and a complete pattern for wives since
according to master simon's account she never
contradicts honest jack and yet manages to have
her own way and to control him in everything

she received us in the main room the house
a kind parlour and hall with great brown
beams timber across it which tibbets is apt
to point out with some exultation observing that
they don't put such timber in houses nowadays
the furniture was old fashioned strong and
highly polished the walls were hung with coloured
prints the story the prodigal son
who was represented in a red coat and leather
breeches over the fireplace was a blunderbuss
and a hard favoured likeness ready money
jack taken when he was a young man by the
the farm house 
same artist that painted the tavern sign his mother
having taken a notion that the tibbets had
as much right to have a gallery family portraits
as the folks at the hall
the good dame pressed us very much to take
some refreshment and tempted us with a variety
 household dainties so that we were glad to
compound by tasting some her homemade
wines while we were there the son and heir
apparent came home a good looking young fellow
and something a rustic beau he took
us over the premises and showed us the whole
establishment an air homely but substantial
plenty prevailed throughout every thing
was the jest materials and in the best condition
nothing was out place or ill made 
and you saw every where the signs a man
that took care to have the worth his money
and that paid as he went
the farm yard was well stocked under a
shed was a taxed cart in trim order in which
ready money jack took his wife about the country
his wellfed horse neighed from the stag
the farm house
able and when led into the yard to use the words
 young jack he shone like a bottle for he
said the old man made it a rule that every thing
about him should fare as well as he did himself
i was pleased to see the pride which the young
fellow seemed to have his father he gave
us several particulars concerning his habits which
were pretty much to the effect those i have
already mentioned he had never suffered an
account to stand in his life always providing the
money before he purchased any thing and if
possible paying in gold and silver he had a
great dislike to paper money and seldom went
without a considerable sum in gold about him
on my observing that it was a wonder he had
never been waylaid and robbed the young fellow
smiled at the idea any one venturing upon
such an exploit for i believe he thinks the old
man would be a match for robin hood and all
his gang
i have noticed that master simon seldom goes
into any house without having a world private
talk with some one or other the family being
the farm house 
a kind universal counsellor and confidant
we had not been long at the farm before the
old dame got him into a corner her parlour
where they had a long whispering conference
together in which i saw by his shrugs that there
were some dubious matters discussed and by his
nods that he agreed with every thing she said
after we had come out the young man accompanied
us a little distance and then drawing
master simon aside into a green lane they walked
and talked together for nearly half an hour
master simon who has the usual propensity 
confidants to blab every thing to the next friend
they meet with let me know that there was a
love affair in question the young fellow having
been smitten with the charms phoebe wilkins
the pretty niece the housekeeper at the hall
like most other love concerns it had brought
its troubles and perplexities dame tibbets
had long been on intimate gossiping terms with
the housekeeper who often visited the farmhouse
but when the neighbours spoke to her
 the likelihood a match between her son and
 the farm house
phoebe wilkins marry come up she scouted
the very idea the girl had acted as lady's
maid and it was beneath the blood the gibbets
who had lived on their own lands time out
 mind and owed reverence and thanks to nobody
to have the heir apparent marry a servant

these vapourings had faithfully been carried
to the housekeeper's ear by one their mutual
gobetween friends the old housekeeper's
blood if not as ancient was as quick as that 
dame tibbets she had been accustomed to
carry a high head at the hall and among the
villagers and her faded brocade rustled with
indignation at the slight cast upon her alliance
by the wife a petty farmer she maintained
that her niece had been a companion rather thana
waiting maid to the young ladies thank
heaven she was not obliged to work for her
living and was as idle as any young lady in the
land and when somebody died would receive
something that would be worth the notice 
some folks with all their ready money
the farm house 
a bitter feud had thus taken place between
the two worthy dames and the young people
were forbidden to think one another as to
young jack he was too much in love to reason
upon the matter and being a little heady and
not standing in much awe his mother was
ready to sacrifice the whole dignity the gibbets
to his passion he had lately however
had a violent quarrel with his mistress in consequence
 some coquetry on her part and at
present stood aloof the politic mother was
exerting all her ingenuity to widen this accidental
breach but as is most commonly the case the
more she meddled with this perverse inclination
 her son's the stronger it grew in the meantime
old ready money was kept completely in
the dark both parties were in awe and uncertainty
as to what might be his way taking the
matter and dreaded to awaken the sleeping lion
between father and son therefore the worthy
mrs tibbets was full business and at her
wit's it is true there was no great danger
 honest ready money's finding the thing out
i
 the farm house
if left to himself for he was a most unsuspicious
temper and by no means quick apprehension
 but there was daily risk his attention
being aroused by those cobwebs which his wife
was continually spinning about his nose
such is the distracted state politics in the
domestic empire ready money jack which
only shows the intrigues and internal dangers to
which the best regulated governments are liable
in this perplexed situation their affairs both
mother and son have applied to master simon
for counsel and with all his experience in meddling
with other people's concerns he finds it an
exceedingly difficult part to play to agree with
both parties seeing that their opinions and wishes
are so diametrically opposite
story telling
a favourite evening pastime at the hall and
one which the worthy squire is fond promoting
is story telling a good old fashioned
fireside amusement as he terms it indeed i
believe he promotes it chiefly because it was
one the choice recreations in those days 
yore when ladies and gentlemen were not
much in the habit reading be this as it
may he will often at supper table when conversation
flags call upon some one or other
 the company for a story as it was formerly
the custom to call for a song and it is edifying
to see the exemplary patience and even satisfaction
with which the good old gentleman will sit
and listen to some hackneyed tale that he has
heard for at least an hundred times
in this way one evening the current 
anecdotes and stories ran upon mysterious per
vol i 
 story telling
songes that have figured at different times and
filled the world with doubt and conjecture such
as the wandering jew the man with the iron
mask who tormented the curiosity all europe
the invisible girl and last though not
least the pigfaced lady
at length one the company was called
upon that had the most unpromising physiognomy
for a story teller that i had ever seen
he was a thin pale weakenfaced man extremely
nervous that had sat at one corner
 the table shrunk up as it were into himself
and almost swallowed up in the cape his
coat as a turtle in its shell
the very demand seemed to throw him into
a nervous agitation yet he did not refuse
he emerged his head out his shell made a
few odd grimaces and gesticulations before he
could get his muscles into order or his voice
under command and then offered to give some
account a mysterious personage that he had
recently encountered in the course his travels
story telling 
and one whom he thought fully entitled to be
classed with the man with the iron mask
i was so much struck with his extraordinary
narrative that i have written it out to the best
 my recollection for the amusement the
reader i think it has in it all the elements
 that mysterious and romantic narrative so
greedily sought after at the present day
the stout gentleman
a tale mystery
ill cross it though it blast me 
hamlet
it was a rainy sunday in the gloomy month
 november i had been detained in the
course a journey by a slight indisposition
from which i was recovering but i was still
feverish and was obliged to keep within doors
all day in an inn the small town derby
a wet sunday in a country inn whoever has
had the luck to experience one can alone judge
 my situation the rain pattered against
the casements the bells tolled for church
with a melancholy sound i went to the windows
in quest something to amuse the eye 
but it seemed as if i had been placed completely

the stout gentleman 
out the reach all amusement the windows
 my bed room looked out among tiled
roofs and stacks chimneys while those 
my sitting room commanded a full view the
stable yard i know nothing more calculated
to make a man sick this world than a stable
yard on a rainy day the place was littered
with wet straw that had been kicked about
by travellers and stable boys in one corner
was a stagnant pool water surrounding
an island muck there were several half
drowned fowls crowded together under a cart
among which was a miserable crestfallen
cock drenched out all life and spirit his
drooping tail matted as it were into a single
feather along which the water trickled from
his back near the cart was a halfdozing
cow chewing the cud and standing patiently
to be rained on with wreaths vapour
rising from her reeking hide a walleyed horse
tired the loneliness the stable was poking
his spectral head out a window with the rain
dripping on it from the eaves an unhappy cur
the stout gentleman
chained to a dog house hard by uttered something
every now and then between a bark and
a yelp a drab a kitchen wench tramped
backwards and forwards through the yard in
patterns looking as sulky as the weather itself
every thing in short was comfortless and forlorn
excepting a crew harddrinking ducks
assembled like boon companions round a puddle
and making a riotous noise over their liquor
i was lonely and listless and wanted amusement
my room soon became insupportable i
abandoned it and sought what is technically called
the traveller's room this is a public room
set apart at most inns for the accomodation 
a class wayfarers called travellers or riders 
a kind commercial knights errant who are
incessantly scouring the kingdom in gigs on
horseback or by coach they are the only
successors that i know at the present day
to the knights errant yore they lead the
same kind roving adventurous life only
changing the lance for a whip the buckler fora
pattern card and the coat mail for an
the stout gentleman 
upper benjamin instead vindicating the
charms peerless beauty they rove about
spreading the fame and standing some substantial
tradesman or manufacturer arid are
ready at any time to bargain in his name it
being the fashion nowadays to trade instead 
fight with one another as the room the
hostel in the good old fighting times would
be hung round at night with the armour 
wayworn warriors such as coats mail falchions
and yawning helmets so the traveller's
room is garnished with the harnessing their
successors with box coats whips all kinds
spurs gaiters and oil cloth covered hats
i was in hopes finding some these
worthies to talk with but was disappointed
there were indeed two or three in the
room but i could make nothing them one
was just finishing his breakfast quarrelling
with his bread and butter and huffing the
waiter another buttoned on a pair gaiters
with many execrations at boots for not
having cleaned his shoes well a third sat
 the stout gentleman
drumming on the table with his fingers and
looking at the rain as it streamed down the
window glass they all appeared infected by
the weather and disappeared one after the
other without exchanging a word
i sauntered to the window and stood gazing
at the people picking their way to church with
petticoats hoisted midleg high and dripping umbrellas
the bell ceased to toll and the streets
became silent i then amused myself with
watching the daughters a tradesman opposite
 who being confined to the house for fear
 wetting their sunday finery played off their
charms at the front windows to fascinate the
chance tenants the inn they at length
were summoned away by a vigilant vinegarfaced
mother and i had nothing farther from
without to amuse me
what was i to do to pass away the longlived
day i was sadly nervous and lonely 
and every thing about an inn seems calculated to
make a dull day ten times duller old newspapers
smelling beer and tobacco smoke and
the stout gentleman 
which i had already read half a dozen times
good for nothing books that were worse than
the rainy weather i bored myself to death
with an old volume the lady's magazine
i read all the common placed names ambitious
travellers scrawled on the panes glass 
the eternal families the smiths and the
browns and the jacksons and the johnson
and all the other sons and i deciphered several
scraps fatiguing innwindow poetry that
i have met with in all parts the world
the day continued lowering and gloomy 
the slovenly ragged spongy clouds drifted
heavily along in the air there was no variety
even in the rain it was one dull continued
monotonous patter patter patter excepting that
now and then i was enlivened by the idea a
brisk shower from the rattling the drops
upon a passing umbrella it was quite refreshing
if i may be allowed a hackneyed phrase
 the day when in the course the morning
a horn blew and a stage coach whirled through
the street with outside passengers stuck all
vol i 
 the stout gentleman
over it cowering under cotton umbrellas and
seethed together and reeking with the steams
 wet box coats and upper benjamins
the sound brought out from their lurking
places a crew vagabond boys and vagabond
dogs with the carrots headed hostler and that
non rescript animal ycleped boots and all the
other vagabond race that infest the purlieus 
an inn but the bustle was transient the coach
again whirled on its way and boy and dog
and hostler and boots all slunk back again to
their holes and the street again became silent
and the rain continued to rain on in fact there
was no hope its clearing up the barometer
pointed to rainy weather mine hostess tortoiseshell
cat sat by the fire washing her face and
rubbing her paws over her ears and on referring
to the almanac i found a direful prediction
stretching from the top the page to the
bottom through the whole month 

i was dreadfully hipped the hours seemed
as if they would never creep by the very
ticking the clock became irksome at length
the stout gentleman 
the stillness the house was interrupted by the
ringing a bell shortly after i heard the
voice a waiter at the bar the stout gentleman
in no wants his breakfast tea
and bread and butter with ham and eggs the
eggs not to be too much done
in such a situation as mine every incident is
 importance here was a subject speculation
presented to my mind and ample exercise
for my imagination i am prone to paint
pictures to myself and on this occasion i had
some materials to work upon had the guest
up stairs been mentioned as mr smith or
mr brown or mr jackson or mr johnson
or merely as the gentleman in no it would
have been a perfect blank to me i should have
thought nothing it but the stout gentleman
 the very name had something in it
 the picturesque it at once gave the size it
embodied the personage to my mind's eye and
my fancy did the rest he was stoutor as
some term it lusty in all probability therefore
he was advanced in life some people expanding
 the stout gentleman
as they grow old by his breakfasting rather
late and in his own room he must be a man
accustomed to live at his ease and above the
necessity early rising no doubt abound rosy
lusty old gentleman
there was another violent ringing the stout
gentleman was impatient for his breakfast he
was evidently a man importance well todo
in the world accustomed to be promptly
waited upon a keen appetite and a little cross
when hungry perhaps thought i he maybe
some london alderman or who knows but
he may be a member parliament 
 the breakfast was sent up and there was a
short interval silence he was doubtless making
the tea presently there was a violent ringing
and before it could be answered another
ringing still more violent bless me what a
choleric old gentleman the waiter came
down in a huff the butter was rancid the
eggs were overdone the ham was too salt the
stout gentleman was evidently nice in his eating
one those who eat and growl and keep the
the stout gentleman v 
waiter on the trot and live in a state militant
with the household
the hostess got into a fume i should observe
that she was a brisk coquettish woman a
little a shrew and something a slammerkin
but very pretty withal with a nincompoop
for a husband as shrews are apt to have she
rated the servants roundly for their negligence
in sending up so bad a breakfast but said not a
word against the stout gentleman by which i
clearly perceived that he must be a man consequence
 entitled to make a noise and to give
trouble at a country inn other eggs and ham
and bread and butter were sent they appeared
to be more graciously received at least there
was no further complaint
i had not made many turns about the traveller's
room when there was another ringing
shortly afterwards there was a stir and an inquest
about the house the stout gentleman
wanted the times or the chronicle newspaper
i set him down therefore for a whig or rather
from his being so absolute and lordly where he
j the stout gentleman
had a chance i suspected him being a radical
hunt i had heard was a large man who
knows thought i but it is hunt himself
my curiosity began to be awakened i inquired
 the waiter who was this stout gentleman
that was making all this stir but i could
get no information nobody seemed to know
his name the landlords bustling inns seldom
trouble their heads about the names their
transient guests the colour a coat the
shape or sifee the person is enough to suggest a
travelling name it is either the tall gentleman
or the short gentleman or the gentleman in
black or the gentleman in snuff colour or as in
the present instance the stout gentleman a designation
 the kind once hit on answers every
purpose and saves all farther inquiry
rain rain rain pitiless ceaseless rain no
such thing as putting a foot out doors and no
occupation or amusement within by and bye
i heard some one walking over head it was in
the stout gentleman's room he evidently was
a large man by the heaviness his tread and
the stout gentleman 
an old man from his wearing such creaking
soles he is doubtless thought i some
rich old square toes regular habits and is now
taking exercise after breakfast
i now read all the advertisements coaches
and hotels that were stuck about the mantlepiece
the lady's magazine had become an
abomination to me it was as tedious as the day
itself i wandered out not knowing what todo
and ascended again to my room i had not
been there long when there was a squall from a
neighbouring bed room a door opened and
slammed violently a chambermaid that i had
remarked for a ruddy good humoured face went
down stairs in a violent flurry the stout gentleman
had been rude to her
this sent a whole host my deductions to
the deuce in a moment this unknown personage
could not be an old gentleman for old gentlemen
are not apt to be so obstreperous to chambermaids
he could not be a young gentleman
 for young gentleman are not apt to inspire
such indignation he must be a middle aged
 the stout gentleman
man and confoundedly ugly into the bargain or
the girl would not have taken the matter in such
terrible dudgeon i confess i was sorely puzzled
in a few minutes i heard the voice my
landlady i caught a glance her as she came
tramping up stairs her face glowing her cap
flaring her tongue wagging the whole way
she'd have no such doings in her house she'd
warrant if gentlemen did spend their money
freely it was no rule she'd have no servant
maids her's treated in that way when they
were about their work that's what she wouldn't
as i hate squabbles particularly with women
and above all with pretty women i slunk back
into my room and partly closed the door but
my curiosity was too much excited not to listen
the landlady marched intrepidly to the enemy's
citadel and entered it with a storm the door
closed after her i heard her voice in high windy
clamour for a moment or two then it gradually
subsided like a gust wind in a garret
then there was a laugh then i heard nothing
more after a little while my landlady came
the stout gentleman 
out with an odd smile on her face adjusting her
cap which was a little on one side as she went
down stairs i heard the landlord ask her what
was the matter she said nothing at all
only the girl's a fool i was more than ever
perplexed what to make this unaccountable
personage who could put a goodnatured chambermaid
in a passion and send away a termagant
landlady in smiles he could npt be so
old nor cross nor ugly either
i had to go to work at his picture again and
to paint him entirely different i now set him
down for one those stout gentlemen that are
frequently met with swaggering about the doors
 country inns moist merry fellows in bel
cher handkerchiefs whose bulk is a little assisted
by malt liquors men who have seen the world
and been sworn at highgate who are used
to tavern life up to all the tricks tapsters
and knowing in the ways sinful publicans
free livers on a small scale who are prodigal
within the compass a guinea who call all the
waiters by name tousle the maids gossip with
vol i
 the stout gentleman
the landlady at the bar and prose over a pint 
port or a glass negus after dinner
the morning wore away in forming these and
similar surmises as fast as i wove one system
 belief some movement the unknown would
completely overturn it and throw all my thoughts
again into confusion such are the solitary operations
 a feverish mind i was as i have
said extremely nervous and the continual meditation
on the concerns this invisible personage
began to have its effect i was getting a fit 
the fidgets
dinner time came i hoped the stout gentleman
might dine in the traveller's room and that
i might at length get a view his person but
no he had dinner served in his own room
what could be the meaning this solitude and
mystery he could not be a radical there
was something too aristocratical in thus keeping
himself apart from the rest the world and
condemning himself to his own dull company
throughout a rainy day and then too he lived
i 
too well for a discontented politician he seemed
the stout gentleman 
to expatiate on a variety dishes and to sit
over his wine like a jolly friend good living
indeed my doubts on this head were soon at
an for he could not have finished his first
bottle before i could faintly hear him humming
a tune and on listening i found it to be god
save the king twas plain then he was no
radical but a faithful subject one that grew
loyal over his bottle and was ready to stand by
king and constitution when he could stand by
nothing else but who could he be my
conjectures began to run wild was he not some
personage distinction travelling incog
god knows said i at my wit's it
may be one the royal family for aught i
know for they are all stout gentlemen 
the weather continued rainy the mysterious
unknown kept his room and as far as i could
judge his chair for i did not hear him move
in the mean time as the day advanced the traveller's
room began to be frequented some
who had just arrived came in buttoned up in
box coats others came home who had been
 the stout gentleman
dispersed about the town some took their dinners
and some their tea had i been in a different
mood i should have found entertainment
in studying this peculiar class men there
were two especially who were regular wags 
the road and up to all the standing jokes travellers
they had a thousand sly things to say
to the waiting maid whom they called louisa
and ethelinda and a dozen other fine names 
changing the name every time and chuckling
amazingly at their own waggery my mind
however had become completely engrossed by
the stout gentleman he had kept my fancy in
chace during a long day and it was not now to
be diverted from the scent
the evening gradually wore away the
travellers read the papers two or three times over
some drew round the fire and told long stories
about their horses about their adventures their
overturns and breaking down they discussed
the credits different merchants and different
inns and the two wags told several choice anecdotes
 pretty chambermaids and kind landladies
the stout gentleman 
all this passed as they were quietly taking what
they called their night caps that is to say
strong glasses brandy and water with sugar or
some other mixture the kind after which they
one after another rang for boots and the chambermaid
and walked up to bed in old shoes cut
down into marvellously uncomfortable slippers
there was only one man left a short legged
longbodied plethoric fellow with a very large
sandy head he sat by himself with a glass 
port wine negus and a spoon sipping and stirring
until nothing was left but the spoon he
gradually fell asleep bolt upright in his chair
with the empty glass standing before him and
the candle seemed to fall asleep too for the wick
grew long and black and cabbaged at the 
and dimmed the little light that remained in the
chamber
the gloom that now prevailed was contagious
around hung the shapeless and almost
spectral box coats departed travellers long
since buried in deep sleep i only heard the
ticking the clock with the deepdrawn breathe
the stout gentleman
kings the sleeping toper and the drippings 
the rain dropdropdrop from the ears the
house
the church bells chimed midnight all at
once the stout gentleman began to walk overhead
pacing slowly backwards and forwards
there was something extremely awful in all this
especially to one in my state nerves these
ghastly greatcoats these guttural breathing and
the creaking footsteps this mysterious being
his steps grew fainter and fainter and at length
died away i could bear it no longer i was
wound up to the desperation a hero romance
 be he who or what he may said i
to myself i'll have a sight him i seized
a chamber candle and hurried up to no 
the door stood ajar i hesitated i entered the
room was deserted there stood a large broad
bottomed elbow chair at a table on which was
an empty tumbler and a times newspaper
and the room smelt powerfully stilton
cheese
the mysterious stranger had evidently but
just retired i turned off to my room sorely disthe
stout gentleman 
appointed as i went along the corridor i saw
a large pair boots with dirty waxed tops
standing at the door a bed chamber they
doubtless belonged to the unknown but it would
not do to disturb so redoubtable a personage in
his den he might discharge a pistol or something
worse at my head i went to bed therefore
and lay awake half the night in a terribly
nervous state and even when i fell asleep i was
still haunted in my dreams by the idea the
stout gentleman and his waxtopped boots
i slept rather late the next morning and was
awakened by some stir and bustle in the house
which i could not at first comprehend until
getting more awake i found there was a mail
coach starting from the door suddenly there
was a cry from below 
the gentleman has forgot his umbrella
look for the gentleman's umbrella in no 
i heard an immediate scampering a chambermaid
along the passage and a shrill reply
as she ran here it is here's the gentleman's
umbrella 
 the stout gentleman
the mysterious stranger then was on the
point setting off this was the only chance
i should ever have knowing him i sprang
out bed scrambled to the window snatched
aside the curtains and just caught a glimpse 
the rear a person getting in at the coach door
the skirts a brown coat parted behind and
gave me a full view the broad disk a pair
 drab breeches the door closed all right
was the word the coach whirled off and that
was all i ever saw the stout gentleman 
forest trees
a living gallery aged trees
one the favourite themes boasting with
the squire is the noble trees on his estate which
in truth has some the finest that i have seen
in england
there is something august and solemn in the
great avenues stately oaks that gather their
branches together high in the air and seem to reduce
the pedestrians between them to mere pig
mies
an avenue oaks or elms the squire observes
 is the true colonnade that should lead
to a gentleman's house as to stone and marble
any one can rear them at once they are the
work the day but commend me to the covol
i 
 forest trees
colonnades that have grown old and great with the
family and tell by their grandeur how long the
family has endured
the squire has great reverence for certain
venerable trees gray with moss which he considers
as the ancient nobility his domain
there is the ruin an enormous oak which
has been so much battered by time and tempest
that scarce any thing is left though he says
christy recollects when in his boyhood it was
healthy and flourishing until it was struck by
lightning it is now a mere trunk with one
twisted bough stretching up into the air bearing
a green branch at the it this sturdy
wreck is much valued by the squire he calls
it his standard bearer and compares it to a veteran
warrior beaten down in the battle but bearing
up his banner to the last he has actually
had a fence built round it to protect it as much
as possible from farther injury
it is with great difficulty that the squire can
be brought to have any tree cut down on his estate
to some he looks with reverence as havforest
trees 
ing been planted by his ancestors to others with
a kind paternal affection as having been
planted by himself and he feels a degree awe
in bringing down with a few strokes the axe
what it has cost centuries to build up i confess
i cannot but sympathize in some degree
with the good squire on the subject
though brought up in a country overrun with
forests where trees are apt to be considered
mere incumbrances and to be laid low without
hesitation or remorse yet i could never see a fine
tree hewn down without concern the poets
who are naturally lovers trees as they are 
every thing that is beautiful have artfully awakened
great interest in their favour by representing
them as the habitations sylvan deities 
insomuch that every great tree had its tutelar
genius or a nymph whose existence was limited
to its duration evelyn in his sylva makes several
pleasing and fanciful allusions to this superstition
 as the fall says he a very
aged oak giving a crack like thunder has often
been heard at many miles distance constrained
 forest trees
as i often am to fell them with reluctancy i do
not at any time remember to have heard the
groans those nymphs grieving to be dispossessed
 their ancient habitations without some
emotion and pity and again in alluding to a
violent storm that had devastated the woodlands
he says methinks i still hear sure i am that i
still feel the dismal groans our forests the
late dreadful hurricane having subverted so many
thousands goodly oaks prostrating the trees
laying them in ghastly postures like whole regiments
fallen in battle by the sword the conqueror
and crushing all that grew beneath them
the public accounts he adds reckon no less
than three thousand brave oaks in one part only
 the forest dean blown down
i have paused more than once in the wilderness
 america to contemplate the traces 
some blast wind which seemed to have rushed
down from the clouds and ripped its way
through the bosom the woodlands rooting
up shivering and splintering the stoutest trees
and leaving a long track desolation
forest trees 
there was something awful in the vast havoc
made among these gigantic plants and in considering
their magnificent remains so rudely
torn and mangled and hurled down to perish
prematurely on their native soil i was conscious
 a strong movement the sympathy so feelingly
expressed by evelyn i recollect also
hearing a traveller poetical temperament expressing
the kind horror which he felt on beholding
on the banks the missouri an oak 
prodigious size which had been in a manner
overpowered by an enormous wild grape vine
the vine had clasped its huge folds round the
trunk and from thence had wound about every
branch and twig until the mighty tree had
withered in its embrace it seemed like laocoon
struggling ineffectually in the hideous coils
 the monster python it was the lion trees
perishing in the embraces a vegetable boa
i am fond listening to the conversation 
english gentlemen on rural concerns and noticing
with what taste and discrimination and
what strong unaffected interest they will 
forest trees
cuss topics which in other countries are abandoned
to mere woodmen or rustic cultivators i
have heard a noble earl descant on park and forest
scenery with the science and feeling a
painter he dwelt on the shape and beauty 
particular trees on his estate with as much pride
and technical precision as though he had been
discussing the merits statues in his collection
i found that he had even gone considerable
distances to examine trees which were celebrated
among rural amateurs for it seems that
trees like houses have their established points
 excellence and that there are some in england
which enjoy very extensive celebrity from
being perfect in their kind
there is something nobly simple and pure in
such a taste it argues think a sweet and
generous nature to have this strong relish for
the beauties vegetation and this friendship
for the hardy and glorious sons the forest
there is a grandeur thought connected with
this part rural economy it is if may be
allowed the figure the heroic line husbandry
forest trees 
it is worthy liberal and free born and aspiring
men he who plants an oak looks forward
to future ages and plants for posterity
nothing can be less selfish than this he cannot
expect to sit in its shade nor enjoy its shelter
but he exults in the idea that the acorn
which he has buried in the earth shall grow up
into a lofty pile and shall keep on flourishing
and increasing and benefiting mankind long after
he shall have ceased to tread his paternal
fields
indeed it is the nature such occupations
to lift the thought above mere worldliness as
the leaves trees are said to absorb all noxious
qualities the air and to breathe forth a purer
atmosphere so it seems to me as if they drew
from us all sordid and angry passions and
breathed forth peace and philanthropy there
is a serene and settled majesty in woodland
scenery that enters into the soul and dilates
and elevates it and fills it with noble inclinations
the ancient and hereditary groves too
that embower this island are most them full
 forest trees
 story they are haunted by the recollections
 great spirits past ages who have
sought for relaxation among them from the
tumult arms or the toils state or have
wooed the muse beneath their shade
who can walk with soul unmoved among the
stately groves penshurst where the gallant
the amiable the elegant sir philip sidney passed
his boyhood or can look without fondness
upon the tree that is said to have been planted
on his birth day or can ramble among the
classic bowers harley treading in the footsteps
 a pope and a littleton or can pause
among the solitudes windsor forest and look
at the oaks around huge gray and timeworn
like the old castle towers and not feel as if he
were surrounded by so many monuments long
enduring glory it is when viewed in this
light that planted groves and stately avenues
and cultivated parks have an advantage over
the more luxuriant beauties unassisted nature
it is that they teem with moral associations and
keep up the ever interesting story human
existence
forest trees 
it is becoming then for the high and generous
spirits an ancient nation to cherish these
sacred groves that surround their ancestral mansions
and to perpetuate them to their descendants
brought up as i have been in republican
habits and principles i can feel nothing 
the servile reverence for titled rank merely because
it is titled but i trust i am neither
churl nor bigot in my creed i do see and feel
how hereditary distinction when it falls to the
lot a generous mind may elevate that mind
into true nobility it is one the effects 
hereditary rank when it falls thus happily that
it multiplies the duties and as it were extends
the existence the possessor he does not
feel himself a mere individual link in creation
responsible only for his own brief term being
he carries back his existence in proud recollection
and he extends it forward in honourable
anticipation he lives with his ancestry and
he lives with his posterity to both does he
consider himself involved in deep responsibilities
as he has received much from those that have
vol i 
 forest trees
gone before so he feels bound to transmit much
to those who are to come after him
his domestic undertakings seem to imply a
longer existence than those ordinary men
none are so apt to build and plant for future centuries
as noble spirited men who have received
their heritages from foregone ages
i can easily imagine therefore the fondness
and pride with which i have noticed english
gentlemen generous temperaments but high
aristocratic feelings contemplating those magnificent
trees which rise like towers and pyramids
from the midst their paternal lands
there is an affinity between all natures animate
and inanimate the oak in the pride and lustihood
 its growth seems to me to take its
range with the lion and the eagle and to assimilate
in the grandeur its attributes to heroic
and intellectual man
with its mighty pillar rising straight and direct
toward heaven bearing up its leafy honours
from the impurities earth and supporting
them aloft in free air and glorious sunforest
trees 
shine it is an emblem what a true nobleman
should be a refuge for the weak a shelter for
the oppressed a defence for the defenceless 
warding off from them the pelting the storm
or the scorching rays arbitrary power he
who is this is an ornament and a blessing to
his native land he who is otherwise abuses
his eminent advantages abuses the grandeur
and prosperity which he has drawn from the
bosom his country should tempests arise
and he be laid prostrate by the storm who
would mourn over his fall should he be borne
down by the oppressive hand power who
would murmur at his fate why cumbered
he the ground 
horsemanship
indeed a coach was a strange monster in those days and the
sight one put both horse and man into amazement some said it
was a great crab shell brought out china and some imagined it to
be one the pagan temples in which the cannibals adored the divell
taylor the water poet
i have made casual mention more than once
 one the squire's antiquated retainers old
christy the huntsman i find that his crusty
crabbed humours are a source much entertainment
among the young gentlemen the family
especially the oxonian who takes a mischievous
pleasure now and then in slyly rubbing the old
man against the grain and then amuses himself
with smoothing him down again for the old
fellow is as ready to bristle up his back as a
porcupine he rides an old hunter called pepper
which is a counterpart himself a most
horsemanship 
wrathful headstrong animal that frets the flesh
off its bones bites kicks and plays all kinds
 villanous tricks
he is as tough and nearly as old as his rider
who has ridden him time out mind and is indeed
the only one that can do any thing with
him sometimes however they have a complete
quarrel and a dispute for mastery and then i am
told it is as good as a farce to see the heat they
both get into and the wrong headed contest that
ensues for they are quite knowing in each other's
ways and in the art teasing and fretting
each other notwithstanding these doughty
brawls however there is nothing that nettles old
christy sooner than to question the merits his
horse which he will uphold as tenaciously asa
faithful husband will vindicate the virtues 
the termagant spouse that gives him a curtain
lecture every night his life
the young men call old christy their professor
 equitation arid in explaining this
phrase they let me into some particulars the
squire's mode bringing up his children
 horsemanship
there is an odd mixture eccentricity any
good sense in all the opinions my worthy
host his mind is like modern gothic where
plain brick work is set off with pointed arches
and quaint tracery though the main groundwork
 his opinions is correct yet he has a
thousand little notions picked up from old books
which stand out whimsically on the surface 
his mind
thus in rearing his boys pelham markham
and such like old english writers were his
manuals at an early age he took his lads out
 their mother's hands w ho was disposed as
mothers are apt to be to make fine orderly children
 them that should keep out sun and
rain and never soil their hands nor tear their
clothes in place this the squire turned them
loose to run free and wild about the park without
heeding wind or weather he was also
particularly attentive in making them bold and
expert horsemen and these were the days when
old christy the huntsman enjoyed great importance
 as the lads were put under his care to
horsemanship 
practise them at the leaping bars and to keep
an eye upon them in the chase
the squire always objected to their riding in
carriages any kind and is still a little tenacious
on this point he often rails against the
universal use carriages and quotes the words
 honest nashe to that effect it was thought
says nashe in his quaternio a kind solecism
and to savour effeminacy for a young
gentleman in the flourishing time his age to
creep into his coach and to shroud himself
from wind and weather our great delight was
to outbrave the blustering boreas upon a great
horse to arm and prepare ourselves to go with
mars and bellona into the field was our sport
and pastime coaches and arches we left unto
them for whom they were first invented for ladies
and gentlemen and decrepid age and impotent
people
the squire insists that the english gentlemen
have lost much their hardiness and manhood
since the introduction carriages compare
he will say the fine gentleman 
horsemanship
mer times ever on horseback booted and
spurred and travel stained but open frank
manly and chivalrous with the fine gentleman
 the present day full affectation and effeminacy
rolling along a turnpike in his voluptuous
vehicle the young men those days
were rendered brave and lofty and generous in
their notions by almost living in their saddles
and having their foaming steeds like proud
seas under them there is something he
adds in bestriding a fine horse that makes a
man feel more than mortal he seems to have
doubled his nature and to have added to his
own courage and sagacity the power the speed
and stateliness the superb animal on which
he is mounted
it is a great delight says old nashe to see
a young gentleman with his skill and cunning
by his voice rod and spur better to manage
and to command the great bucephalus than the
strongest milo with all his strength one while
to see him make him tread trot and gallop the
ling and one after to see him make him gather
horsemanship 
up roundly to bear his head steadily to run a
full career swiftly to stop a sudden lightly anon
after to see him make him advance to yorke to
go back and sidelong to turn on either hand 
to gallop the gallop galliard to do the capriole
the chambetta and dance the corvette
in conformity to these ideas the squire had
them all on horseback at an early age and made
them ride slap dash about the country without
flinching at hedge or ditch or stone wall to the
imminent danger their necks
even the fair julia was partially included in
this system arid under the instruction old
christy has become one the best horsewomen
in the county the squire says it is better than
all the cosmetics and sweeteners the breath
that ever were invented he extols the horsemanship
 the ladies in former times when queen
elizabeth would scarcely suffer the rain to stop her
accustomed ride and then think he will say
what nobler and sweeter beings it made them
what a difference must there be both in mind
and body between a joyous high spirited dame

 horsemanship
 those days glowing with health and exercise
freshened by every breeze that blows seated
loftily and gracefully in her saddle with plume
on head and hawk on hand and her descendant
 the present day the pale victim modern
routs and ball rooms sunk languidly in one corner
 an enervating carriage
the good squire's equestrian system has had
a happy effect for his sons having passed through
the whole course instruction without breaking
nei k or limb are now healthful spirited and
active and have the true englishman's love fora
horse if their manliness and frankness are
praised in their father's hearing he quotes the
old persian maxim and says they have been
taught to ride to shoot and to speak the
truth
it is true the oxonian has now and then practised
the old gentleman's doctrines a little in the
extreme he is a wild youngster rather fonder
 his horse than his with a little dash 
the dandy though the ladies all pronounced
him to be the flower the flock
horsemanship 
the first year that he was sent to oxford he
had a private tutor appointed to overlook him 
a dry chip the university when he returned
home in the vacation the squire made many
inquiries about how he liked his college and
his studies and his tutor
oh as to my tutor sir i've parted with
him 
you have and pray why so 
oh sir hunting was all the go at our college 
so i discharged my tutor and kept a horse you
know
ah i was not aware that tom said the
squire mildly when tom returned to college
his allowance was doubled to enable him to
keep both horse and tutor

i will now begin to sigh read poets look pale go neatly and be
most apparently in love
marston
i should not be surprised if we should have
another brace turtles at the hall for master
simon has informed me in great confidence that
he suspects the general some design upon the
susceptible heart lady lillycraft i have
indeed noticed a growing attention and courtesy
in the veteran toward her ladyship he
softens very much in her company sits by herat
table and entertains her with long stories
about seringapatam and pleasant anecdotes 
the mulligatawney club i have even seen him
present her with a full blown rose from the hothouse
in a style the most captivating gallantlove
symptoms 
ry and it was accepted with great suavity and
graciousness for her ladyship delights in receiving
the homage and attention the sex
indeed the general was one the earliest admirers
that dangled in her train during her short
reign beauty and they flirted together for half
a season in london some thirty or forty years
since she reminded him lately in the course
 conversation about former days the time
when he used to ride a white horse in hyde
park and to canter so gallantly by the side 
her carriage whereupon i have remarked that
the veteran has regularly escorted her since
when she rides out on horseback and i suspect
he almost persuades himself that he makes
as captivating an appearance as in his youthful
days
it would be an amusing event in the history
 faithful love if this spark the tender
passion after lying dormant such a length 
time should again be fanned into a flame from
among the ashes two burnt out hearts it
may however be nothing but a little venerable
 love symptoms
flirtation the general being a veteran dangler
and the good lady habituated to these kind 
attentions master simon however thinks the
general now that he is growing old is desirous
 getting into warm winter quarters and i
doubt whether the former with all his admiration
 the veteran would be pleased at his
winning the lady as he looks upon lady lilly
craft's house as one his strong holds
among other symptoms that look suspicious
i have observed that the general has lately been
very assiduous in his attentions to her ladyship's
dogs and has several times exposed his fingers
to imminent jeopardy in attempting to pat beauty
on the head it is to be hoped his advances
to the mistress will be more favourably received
as all his overtures toward a caress are greeted
by the pestilent little cur with a wary kindling
 the eye and a most venomous growl
he has moreover been very complaisant toward
my lady's gentlewoman the immaculate
mrs hannah whom he used to speak in a
way that i do not choose to mention whether
love symptoms 
she has the same suspicions with master simon
or not i cannot say but she receives his
civilities with no better grace than the implacable
beauty unscrewing her mouth into the
most acid smile and looking as though she
could bite a piece out him in short the
poor general seems to have as formidable foes
to contend with as a hero ancient fairy tale 
who had to fight his way to his enchanted princess
through ferocious monsters every kind 
and to encounter the brimstone terrors some
fiery dragon
there is still another circumstance which inclines
me to give very considerable credit to
master simon's suspicions lady lillycraft is
very fond quoting poetry and the conversation
often turns upon it on which occasions
the general is thrown completely out it happened
the other day that spenser's fairy queen
was the theme for the great part the morning
 and the poor general sat perfectly silent
i found him not long after in the library with
spectacles on nose a in his hand and
 love symptoms
fast asleep on my approach he awoke slipped
the spectacles into his pocket and began to
read very attentively after a little while he
put a piece paper in the place and laid the
volume aside which i perceived was the fairy
queen i had the curiosity to watch how he
got on in his poetical studies but though i have
repeatedly seen him with the in his hand
yet i find the paper has not advanced above
three or four pages the general being extremely
apt to fall asleep when he reads
falconry
s t e is there hawk which mantle her on perch
whether high tow'ring or accosting low
but i the measure her flight doe search
and all her prey and all her diet know
spenser
among the many recreations the good old
times which the squire has endeavoured to revive
on his estate is that hawking he decries
shooting as a skulking solitary treacherous
sport in comparison but hawking he says was
the noble art hunting carried into the skies
it was the stately amusement gentlemen for
in old times he says according to the welsh saying
 you might know a gentleman by his hawk
horse and greyhound indeed a cavalier was
seldom seen abroad without his hawk on his fist
and even a stately dame did not think herself
vol i 
 falconry
completely equipped in riding forth unless she
had her tasseledhawk held by jesses on her delicate
hand it was thought in those excellent
days says an old writer quite sufficient for a
nobleman to wind their horn and to carry their
hawke fair and leave study and learning to the
children mean people
in pursuance this notion the squire and
his faithful coadjutor master simon have bestowed
unwearied pains in endeavouring to reclaim
as it is termed and to train up hawks for
the sport a bounty has been given for all hawks
that could be brought to them alive and the hall
has been well stocked with vermin the kind
they have studied the st albans and
markham and various other books that have
treated falconry but they have more especially
studied some old tapestry in the house whereon
is represented a party ladies and gentlemen in
ancient dresses with doublets and caps and
flaunting feathers mounted on horse with attendants
on foot all in animated pursuit the
game they have met however continual checks
falconry 
and disappointments in endeavouring to bring
this project into operation their feathered
school has turned out the most untractable and
graceless scholars and then they have had so
much trouble in drilling the hangers on who
were to take charge the hawks old christy
and the game keeper both set their faces against
it for a time christy having been nettled at hearing
what he terms a wild goose chase put on a
par with a fox hunt and the gamekeeper having
always been accustomed to look upon hawks as
highway robbers which it was his duty to
shoot down and nail in terrorem against the outhouses

christy has at length taken the matter in
hand but has done still more mischief by his
intermeddling he is as positive and wrongheaded
as he is about hunting master simon
has continual disputes with him as to feeding
and training the hawks he reads to him long
passages from the st albans but
christy who cannot read has a sovereign contempt
for all knowledge and persists in
 falconry
treating the hawks as if they were game cocks
the consequence is between these jarring systems
the poor birds have had a sad time it
many have fallen victims to christy's feeding and
to master simon's physicking for the latter has
gone to work secundum autem and given them
all the vomiting and cowering laid down in
the books never were poor hawks so fed and
physicked before others have been lost by
being but half reclaimed for on being taken
ir'o the field they have raked after the game
quite out all hearing the call and never
returned to school
all these have been petty but sore grievances
to the squire and have led him to despond about
success he has lately however been rejoiced
by the receipt a fine welch falcon
which master simon terms a li stately high
flyer it is a present from his friend sir watt
williams wynne and has soared many a
time about the pure airs snowdon and the
brow penmanmaur
ever since the squire has received this inva
falconry 
liable present he has been as impatient to sally
forth and make proof it as was don quixote
to assay his rusty armour there have been
some demurs as to whether the bird was in proper
health and training or whether it was the
proper season for the sport but all these have
been overruled by the vehement desire to play
with a new toy and it has been determined
right or w long in season or out season to
have a day's sport in hawking tomorrow
the hall as usual whenever the squire is
about to make some new sally on his hobby
is all agog with the thing miss templeton
who is brought up in reverence for all her guardian's
humours has proposed to be the party
and lady lillycraft has determined to ride out
to the scene action and look on this has
gratified the old gentleman extremely he hails
it as an auspicious omen the revival falconry
 and does not despair but the time will
come when it again will be the pride a fine
lady to carry about a noble falcon in preference
to a parrot or a lap dog
 falconry
i have amused myself with the bustling preparations
 that busy spirit master simon
and the continual thwarting he receives from
the genuine son a pepperbox old christy
they have had half a dozen consultations about
how the hawk is to be prepared for the morning's
sport old nimrod as usual has always
got in a pet upon which master simon has invariably
given up the point observing in a good
humoured tone well well have it your own
way christy only don't put yourself in a passion
a reply which always nettles the old
man ten times more than ever
hawking
the soaring hawk from fist that flies
her falconer doth constrain
sometimes to range the ground about
to find her out again
and if by sight or sound bell
his falcon he may see
wo ho be cries with cheerful voice
the gladdest man is he
handful pleasant desires
at an early hour this morning the hall was
in a bustle preparing for the sport the day i
heard master simon whistling and singing a
ditty under my window at sunrise as he was
preparing some jesses for the hawk's legs a
hearty breakfast well flanked by cold meats
was served up in the great hall all the retainers
and hangers on were in motion the
horses were led up and down before the door 
there was a direful yelping dogs some that
were to accompany us eager to set out and others
 hawking
that were to stay at home being whipped back
to their kennels at length there was a general
turning out the chivalry the fair julia was
dressed in a picturesque hunting dress with a
light plume feathers in her riding hat as
she mounted her favourite galloway i remarked
with pleasure that old christy unbent from his
usual crustiness and hastened to adjust her saddle
and bridle he touched his jockey cap as she
smiled on him and thanked him and then looking
round at the other attendants gave a knowing
motion with his head in which i read pride
and exultation at the charming appearance 
his pupil
lady lillycraft had likewise determined to
witness the sport she was dressed in her
broad white beaver tied under the chin and a
riding habit the last century she rode her
sleek ambling pony whose motion was as easy
as a rocking chair and was gallantly escorted
by the general who looked not unlike one 
the doughty heroes in the old prints the battle
 blenheim
hawking 
the parson likewise accompanied her on the
other side for this was a learned amusement in
which he took great interest and indeed had
given much counsel from his knowledge old
customs at length every thing was arranged
and off we set from the hall
the exercise on horseback puts one in fine
spirits and the scene was gay and animating
the young men the family accompanied miss
templeton she sat lightly and gracefully in
her saddle her plumes dancing and waving in
the air and the group had a charming effect as
they appeared and disappeared among the trees
cantering along with the bounding animation 
youth
the squire and master simon rode together
accompanied by old christy mounted on pepper
the latter bore the hawk on his fist as he insisted
the bird was most accustomed to him there
was a rabble rout on foot composed retainers
from the hall and some idlers from the village
with two or three spaniels for the purpose
 starting the game
vol t 
 hawkins
a kind corps de reserve came on quietly
in the rear composed lady liflycraft general
harbottle the parson and a fat footman
her ladyship ambled gently along on her sleek
pony while the general mounted on a tall hunter
looked down upon her with an air the most
protecting gallantry for my part being no
sportsman i kept with this last party or rather
lagged behind that i might take in the whole
picture and the parson occasionally slackened
his pace and jogged on in company with me
the sport led us at some distance from the
hall in a soft meadow reeking with the moist
verdure spring a little river ran through it
bordered by willows which had put forth their
tender early foliage the sportsmen were inquest
 herons which were said to keep about
this stream
i saw that there was some disputing already
among the leaders the sport the squire
master simon and old christy came every now
and then to a pause to consult together like the
field officers an army and i saw by certain
hawking 
motions the head that christy was as positive
as any old wrong headed german commander

as we were prancing up this quiet meadow
every sound we made was answered by a distinct
echo from the sunny wall an old building
that lay on the opposite margin the stream
the circumstance brought to my mind and i
could not help quoting aloud the description 
an echo on webster's duchess malay 
yond side o th river lies a wall
piece cloister which in my opinion
gives the best echo that you ever heard
so plain is the distinction our words
that many have supposed it is a spirit
that answers
upon hearing this quotation the parson mentioned
a beautiful appellation which the jews
had old for the echo which they called bathcool
that is to say the daughter the
voice
note they spid it was an oracle supplying in the second temple
the want the urim and thummim with which the first temple
was honoured
beaker le monde enchants
 hawking
we had not proceeded very far when a flight
 crows that had been regaling themselves in
the meadow alarmed by the noise we made
suddenly rose old christy all in a flurry
from previous disputing and present surprise
slipped off the hood the hawk and let her
fly immediately there was a bawling and
shouting and yelping and barking that baffles
all description
the crows flew screaming in all directions 
while the hawk soared into the air my attention
however was attracted for a time to the
party in the meadow riding along in the direction
that the bird flew their bright beaming
faces turned up to the bright skies as they
watched the game the men on foot scampered
along looking up and calling out the dogs
bounding and yelping with joyous sympathy i
was delighted with the graceful figure the
fair julia her eye beaming as blue as the sky
she was contemplating her gallant lover rode
close by her side and lady liilycraft who
watched them more than the hawk would every
hawking 
now and then exclaim oh the charming couple

i had paused on a rising ground close by her
ladyship from whence i had a good view the
sport the hawk had singled out a quarry from
among the carrion crew it was in vain old
christy called and whistled and endeavoured
to lure her down she paid no regard to him and
indeed his calls were drowned in the shouts and
yelps the army militia that he had brought
into the field
it was curious to see the efforts the two
birds to get above each other one to make the
fatal swoop the other to avoid it now they
crossed athwart a bright feathery cloud and now
they were against the clear blue sky i confess
being no sportsman i was more interested for
the poor bird that was striving for its life than
for the hawk that was playing the part a mercenary
soldier at length the hawk got the upper
hand and made a rushing stoop at her quarry
but the latter made as sudden a surge downwards
and slanting up again evaded the blow
 hawking
screaming and making the best his way for a
dry tree on the brow a neighbouring hill
the poor crow however began to flag the
falcon was again getting above him i felt more
and more interested when an exclamation from
lady liliycraft made me turn my head
i beheld a complete confusion among the
sportsmen in the little vale below us they
were gal lopping and running towards the edge 
a bank and i was shocked to see miss templeton's
horse galloping along without his rider
i rode to the place to which the others were
hurrying and when i reached the bank which
almost overhung the stream i saw at the foot 
it the fair julia pale bleeding and apparently
lifeless supported in the arms her frantic
lover
in galloping heedlessly along with her eyes
turned upwards she had unwarily approached
too near the bank it had given way with her
and she and her horse had been precipitated to
the pebbled margin the river
i never saw greater consternation the caphawking
ribs
tain was distracted lady lillycraft fainting
the squire in dismay and master simon at
his wit's ends the only one that had real presence
 mind was old christy who ran to the
stream dipped his jockey cap full water and
threw some in her face the beautiful creature
at length showed signs returning life she
opened her eyes looked around her upon the
agonized group and comprehending in a moment
the nature the scene gave a sweet smile
and putting her hand in her lover's exclaimed
feebly i am not much hurt guy i could
have taken her to my heart for that single exclamation
it was found indeed that she had
escaped almost miraculously with a contusion
 the head a sprained ancle and some slight
bruises after her wound was stanched she
was taken to a neighbouring cottage until a carriage
could be summoned to take her home
when the cavalcade which had issued forth so
gayly on this enterprize returned slowly and
pensively to the hall
i had been charmed by the generous spirit
 hawking
shown by this young creature who amidst paiii
and danger had been anxious only to relieve
the distress those around her i was gratified
therefore by the universal concern displayed
by the domestics on our return they
came crowding down the avenue each eager
to render some assistance the butler stood
ready with some curiously delicate cordial
the old housekeeper was provided with half a
dozen nostrums prepared by her own hands
according to the family recipe while her
niece the melting phoebe having no other way
 assisting stood wringing her hands and weeping
aloud
the most material effect that is likely to follow
this accident is a little delay the nuptials
which were close at hand though i
commiserate the impatience the captain on
that account yet i shall not otherwise be sorry
as i shall have a better opportunity studying
the characters here assembled with which i
grow more and more entertained
i cannot but perceive that the squire is quite
hawking 
disconcerted at this unlucky result his hawking
experiment and this unfortunate illustration 
his eulogy on female equitation old christy
too is very waspish having been sorely twitted
by master simon for having let his hawk fly
at carrion as to the falcon in the confusion
occasioned by the fair julia's disaster the bird
was totally forgotten i make no doubt she has
made the best her way back to the hospitable
hall sir watkyn williams wynne and may
very possibly be pluming her wings at this present

the conversation this evening at supper table
took a curious turn on the subject a superstition
formerly very prevalent in this part the
country relative to the present night the year
which is the eve st mark's it was believed
the parson informed us that if any one would
watch in the church porch on this eve for three
successive years from eleven till one o'clock at
night he would see on the third year the shades
 those the parish who were to die in the
st mark's eve 
course the year pass by him into the church
clad in their usual apparel
dismal as such a sight would be he assured
us it was formerly a frequent thing for persons
to make the necessary vigils he had known
more than one instance in his time one old
woman who pretended to have seen this phantom
procession was an object great awe
for the whole year afterwards and caused much
uneasiness and mischief if she shook her head
mysteriously at a person it was like a death warrant
and she had nearly caused the death a
sick person by looking ruefully in at the window

there was also an old man not many years
since a sullen melancholy temperament who
had kept two vigils and began to excite some
talk in the village when fortunately for public
comfort he died shortly after his third watching 
no doubt from a cold which he had taken as the
night was tempestuous it was reported about
the village however that he had seen his own
phantom pass by him into the church
 st mark t s eve
this led to the mention another superstition
 an equally strange and melancholy kind
which however is chiefly confined to wales
it is respecting what are called corpse candles
little wandering fires a pale bluish light that
move about like tapers in the open air and are
supposed to designate the way some corpse is to
go one was seen at lanylar late at night
hovering up and down along the bank the ista
r wish and was watched by the neighbours until
they were tired and went to bed not long
afterwards there came a comely country lass
from montgomeryshire to see her friends who
dwelt on the opposite side the river she
thought to ford the stream at the very place
where the light had been first seen but was
dissuaded on account the height the flood
she walked to and fro along the bank just where
the candle had moved waiting for the subsiding
 the water she at length endeavoured
to cross but the poor girl w r as drowned in the
attempt

there was something mournful in this little
anecdote rural superstition that seemed to
affect all the listeners indeed it is curious to
remark how completely a conversation the
kind will absorb the attention a circle and
sober down its gayety however boisterous by
degrees i noticed that every one was leaning
forward over the table with their eyes fixed
upon the parson and at the mention corpse
candles which had been seen about the chamber
 a young lady who died on the eve 
her wedding day lady lillycraft turned pale
i have witnessed the introduction stories 
the kind into various evening circles they were
often commenced in jest and listened to with
smiles but i never knew the most gay or the
most enlightened audiences that were not if
the conversation continued for any length time
completely and solemnly interested in it there
is i believe a degree superstition lurking in
every mind and i doubt if any one can thoroughly
examine all his secret notions and impulses
without detecting it hidden perhaps even from
 st mark's eve
himself it seems in fact to be a part our
nature like instinct animals acting independently
 our reason it is often found existing
in lofty natures especially those that are poetical
and aspiring a great and extraordinary poet
 our day whose life and writings evince a mind
subject to powerful exaltation is said to believe
in omens and secret intimations caesar it is
well known was greatly under the influence 
such belief and napoleon had his good and evil
days and his presiding star
i am now alone in my chamber but these
themes have taken such hold my imagination
that i cannot sleep the room in which i sit is
just fitted to foster such a state mind the
walls are hung with tapestry the figures which
are faded and look like unsubstantial shapes melting
away from sight over the fireplace is the
portrait a lady who according to the housekeeper's
tradition pined to death for the loss 
her lover in the battle blenheim she has a
most pale and plaintive countenance and seems to
fix her eyes mournfully upon me the family
st mark's eve 
have long since retired i have heard their steps
die away and the distant doors clap to after them
the murmur voices and the peal remote
laughter no longer reach the ear the clock
from the church in which so many the former
inhabitants this house lie buried has chimed
the awful hour midnight
i have sat by the window and mused upon
the dusky landscape watching the lights disappearing
one by one from the distant village and
the moon rising in her silent majesty and leading
up all the silver pomp heaven as i have
gazed upon these quiet groves and shadowy
lawns silvered over and imperfectly lighted by
streaks dewy moonshine my mind has been
crowded by thick coming fancies concerning
those spiritual beings which
walk the earth
unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
are there indeed such beings is this space between
us and the deity filled up by innumerable
orders spiritual beings forming the same gras
st mark's eve
relations between the human soul and divine perfection
that we see prevailing from humanity
down to the meanest insect it is a sublime and
beautiful doctrine inculcated by the early fathers
that there are guardian angels appointed to watch
over cities and nations to take care the welfare
 good men and to guard and guide the
steps helpless infancy nothing says st
jerome gives us a greater idea the dignity
 our souls than that god has given each us
at the moment our birth an angel to have care
 it
even the doctrine departed spirits returning
to visit the scenes and beings which were dear
to them during the bodies existence though it
has been debased by the absurd superstitions 
the vulgar in itself is awfully solemn and sublime

however lightly it may be ridiculed yet the
attention involuntarily yielded to it whenever it
is made the subject serious discussion its prevalence
in all ages and countries and even
among newly discovered nations that have had
st mark's eve 
no previous interchange thought with other
parts the world prove it to be one those
mysterious and almost instinctive beliefs to
which if left to ourselves we should naturally
incline
in spite all the pride reason and philosophy
a vague doubt will still lurk in the mind 
and perhaps will never be perfectly eradicated
as it is a matter that does not admit positive
demonstration who yet has been able to comprehend
and describe the nature the soul its
mysterious connexion with the body or in
what part the frame it is situated we
know merely that it does exist but whence it
came and when it entered into us and how it
is retained and where it is seated and how it
operates are all matters mere speculation and
contradictory theories if then we are thus ignorant
 this spiritual essence even while it
forms a part ourselves and is continually present
to our consciousness how can we pretend
to ascertain or to deny its powers and operations
when released from its fleshy prison house 
vol i 
 st mark's eve
every thing connected with our spiritual nature
is full doubt and difficulty we are fearfully
and wonderfully made we are surrounded
by mysteries and we are mysteries even to ourselves
it is more the manner in which this superstition
has been degraded than its intrinsic
absurdity that has brought it into contempt
raise it above the frivolous purposes to which it
has been applied strip it the gloom and horror
with which it has been enveloped and there
is none the whole circle visionary creeds
that could more delightfully elevate the imagination
or more tenderly affect the heart it would
become a sovereign comfort at the bed death
soothing the bitter tear wrung from us by the
agony our mortal separation what could
be more consoling than the idea that the souls 
those we once loved were permitted to return
and watch over our welfare that affectionate
and guardian spirits sat by our pillows when we
slept keeping a vigil over our most helpless
hours that beauty and innocence which had
languished into the tomb yet smiled unseen
st mark's eve 
around us revealing themselves in those blest
dreams wherein we live over again the hours 
past endearments a belief this kind would
i should think be a new incentive to virtue rendering
us circumspect even in our most secret
moments from the idea that those we once
loved and honoured were invisible witnesses 
all our actions
it would take away too from that loneliness
and destitution which we are apt to feel
more and more as we get on in our pilgrimage
through the wilderness this world and find
that those who set forward with us lovingly
and cheerily on the journey have one by one
dropped away from our side place the superstition
in this light and i confess i should like to
be a believer in it i see nothing in it that is incompatible
with the tender and merciful nature
 our religion nor revolting to the wishes and
affections the heart
there are departed beings that i have loved
as i never again shall love in this world that
have loved me as i never again shall be loved
 st mark's eve
if such beings do ever retain in their blessed
spheres the attachments which they felt on
earth if they take an interest in the poor concerns
 transient mortality and are permitted
to hold communion with those whom they
have loved on earth i feel as if now at this
deep hour night in this silence and solitude
i could receive their visitation with the most
solemn but unalloyed delight
in truth such visitations would be too happy
for this world they would take away from
the bounds and barriers that hem us in and keep
us from each other our existence is doomed
to be made up transient embraces and long
separations the most intimate friendship 
what brief and scattered portions time does
it consist we take each other by the hand
and we exchange a few words and looks 
kindness and we rejoice together for a few short
moments and then days months years intervene
and we have no intercourse with each
other or if we dwell together for a season
the grave soon closes its gates and cuts off all
st mark's eve 
further communion and our spirits must remain
in separation and widowhood until they
meet again in that more perfect state being
where soul shall dwell with soul and there
shall be no such thing as death or absence or
any other interruption our union

i have mentioned some peculiarities the
squire in the education his sons but i would
not have it thought that his instructions were
directed chiefly to their personal accomplishments
he took great pains also to form their
minds and to inculcate what he calls good old
english principles such as are laid down in the
writings pelham and his contemporaries
there is one author whom he cannot speak
without indignation which is chesterfield heavers
that he did much for a time to injure the
true national character and to introduce instead
 open manly sincerity a hollow perfidious
true gentlemen 
courtliness his maxims he affirms were
calculated to chill the delightful enthusiasm 
youth to make them ashamed that romance
which is the dawn generous manhood and to
impart to them a cold polish and a premature
worldliness
many lord chesterfield's maxims would
make a young man a mere man pleasure but
an english gentleman should not be a mere man
 pleasure he has no right to such selfish
indulgence his ease his leisure his opulence
are debts due to his country he should be a
man at all points simple frank and courteous 
intelligent accomplished and informed upright y
intrepid and disinterested one that can mingle
among freemen that can cope with statesmen 
that can champion his country and its rights
either at home or abroad
in a country like england where there is
such free and unbounded scope for the exertion
 intellect and where opinion and example
have such weight with the people every gentleman
 fortune and leisure should feel himself
 true gentlemen
bound to employ himself in some way towards
promoting the prosperity or glory the nation

in a country where intellect and action are
trammelled and restrained men rank and fortune
may become idlers and triflers with impunity 
but an english coxcomb is inexcusable and this
perhaps is the reason why he is the most offensive
and insupportable coxcomb in the world
the squire as frank bracebridge informs me
would often hold forth in this manner to his sons
when they were about leaving the paternal roof
one to travel abroad one to go to the army and
one to the university he used to have them
with him in the library which is hung with the
portraits sydney surrey raleigh what and
others
look at those models true english gentlemen
my sons he would say with enthusiasm
those were men that w r reached the graces 
the most delicate and refined taste around the
hardy virtues the soldier that mingled
what was gentle and gracious with what was
true gentlemen 
hardy and manly that possessed the true chivalry
 spirit which is the exalted essence manhood
they are the lights by which the youth
 this country should array themselves they
were the patterns and the idols their country
at home they were the illustrators its dignity
abroad surrey says camden was the first
nobleman that illustrated his high birth with the
beauty learning he was acknowledged to
be the gallants man the politest lover and the
completest gentleman his time and as to
what his friend surrey most amiably testifies
 him that his person was majestic and beautiful
his visage stern and mild that he sang
and played the lute with remarkable sweetness 
spoke the foreign languages with grace and
fluency and possessed an inexhaustible fund 
wit and see what a high commendation is
passed upon these illustrious friends
they were the two chieftains who having
travelled into italy and there tasted the sweet
and stately measures and style italian poetry
greatly polished our rude and homely manner
vol i 
true gentlemen
 vulgar poetry from what it had been before
and therefore may be justly called the reformers
 our english poetry and style and sir philip
sydney who has left us such monuments 
elegant thought and generous sentiment and
who illustrated his chivalrous spirit so gloriously
in the field and sir walter raleigh
the elegant courtier the intrepid soldier the
enterprizing discoverer the enlightened philosopher
the magnanimous martyr these are
the men for english gentlemen to study chesterfield
with his cold and courtly maxims
would have chilled and impoverished such spirits
he would have blighted all the budding
romance their temperaments sydney would
never have written his arcadia nor surrey
have challenged the world in vindication the
beauties his geraldine these are the
men my sons the squire will continue u that
show to what our national character may be
exalted when its strong and powerful qualities
are duly wrought up and refined the solidtrue
gentlemen 
est bodies are capable the highest polish
and there is no character that may be wrought
to a more exquisite and unsullied brightness
than that the true english gentleman

when guy was about to depart for the army
the squire again took him aside and gave him a
long exhortation he warned him against that
affectation cool blooded indifference which he
was told was prevalent among the young british
officers among whom it was a study to sink
the soldier in the mere man fashion a soldier
said he without pride and enthusiasm in
his profession is a mere sanguinary hireling
nothing distinguishes him from the mercenary
bravo but a spirit patriotism or a thirst for
glory it is the fashion nowadays my son
said he to laugh at the spirit chivalry 
when that spirit is really extinct the profession
 the soldier becomes a mere trade blood
he then set before him the conduct edward
the black prince who is his mirror chivalry 
valiant generous affable humane gallant in
 true gentlemen
the field but when he came to dwell on his
courtesy towards his prisoner the king france 
how he received him into his tent rather as a conqueror
than as a captive attended on him at table
like one his retinue rode uncovered beside
him on his entry into london mounted on a
common palfrey while his prisoner was mounted
in state on a white steed stately beauty the
tears enthusiasm stood in the old gentleman's
eyes
finally on taking leave the good squire put
in his son's hands as a manual one his favourite
old volumes the life the chevalier bayard
by godefroy on a blank page which he had
written an extract from the morte arthur
containing the eulogy sir actor over the body
 sir lancelot the lake which the squire
considers as comprising the excellencies a true
soldier
ah sir launcelot thou wert head all
christian knights now there holiest thou wert
never matched none earthly knight's hands
and thou wert the furthest knight that ever bare
true gentlemen 
shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy
lover that ever bestrode horse and thou wert the
truest lover a simple man that ever loved woman
 and thou wert the kindest man that ever
strook with sword and thou wert the goodliest
person that ever came among the presse 
knights and thou wert the meekest man and the
gentlest that ever late in hall among ladies 
and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal
foe that ever put spare in rest

as i was walking one evening with the oxon
man master simon and the general in a meadow
not far from the village we heard the sound
 a fiddle rudely played and looking in the
direction whence it came we saw a thread
 smoke curling up from among the trees the
sound music is always attractive for wherever
there is music there is good humour or goodwill
we passed along a foot path and had a
peep through a break in the hedge at the musician
and his party when the oxonian gave us a
wink and told us that if we would follow him
we should have some sport t
fortune telling 
ft proved to be a gipsy encampment consisting
 three or four little cabins or tents made 
blankets and sail cloth spread over hoops that
were stuck in the ground it was on one side
 a green lane close under a hawthorn hedge
with a broad beech tree spreading above it a
small rill tinkled along close by through the
fresh sward that looked like a carpet
a tea kettle was hanging by a crooked piece
 iron over a fire made from dry sticks and
leaves and two old gipsies in red cloaks sat
crouched on the grass gossipping over an evening
cup tea for these creatures though they
live in the open air have their ideas fireside
comforts there were two or three children
sleeping on the straw with which the tents were
littered a couple donkeys were grazing in
the lane and a thievish looking dog was lying
before the fire some the younger gipsies
were dancing to the music a fiddle played
by a tall slender stripling in an old frock coat
with a peacock's feather stuck in his hatband
as we approached a gipsy girl with a pair 
 fortune telling
fine roguish eyes came up and as usual offered
to tell our fortunes i could not but admire
a certain degree slattern elegance about the
baggage her long black silken hair was curiously
plaited in numerous small braids and
negligently put up in a picturesque style that a
painter might have been proud to have devised
her dress was figured chintz rather ragged
and not over clean but a variety most
harmonious and agreeable colours for these
beings have a singularly fine eye for colours
her straw hat was in her hand and a red cloak
thrown over one arm
the oxonian offered at once to have his fortune
told and the girl began with the usual volubility
 her race but he drew her on one
side near the hedge as he said he had no idea 
having his secrets overheard i saw he was
talking to her instead she to him and by his
glancing toward us now and then that he was
giving the baggage some private hints
when they returned to us he assumed a very
serious air zounds said he it's very asfortune
telling 
astonishing how these creatures come by their
knowledge this girl has told me some things
that i thought no one knew but myself
the girl now assailed the general come
your honour said she i see by your face
you're a lucky man but you're not happy in
your mind you're not indeed sir but have a
good heart and give me a good piece silver
and i'll tell you a nice fortune
the general had received all her approaches
with a banter and had suffered her to get hold
 his hand but at the mention the piece 
silver he hemmed looked grave and turning tous
asked if we had not better continue our
walk come my master said the girl archly
you'd not be in such a hurry if you knew all
that i could tell you about a fair lady that has a
notion for you come sir old love burns strong
there's many a one comes to see weddings that
go away brides themselves here the girl whispered
something in a low voice at which the
general coloured up was a little fluttered and
suffered himself to be drawn aside under the

hedge where he appeared to listen to her with
great earnestness and at the paid her half a
crown with the air a man that has got the
worth his money
the girl next made her attack upon master
simon who however was too old a bird to be
caught knowing that it would in an attack
upon his purse about which he is a little sensitive
as he has a great notion however 
being considered a royster he chucked her under
the chin played her off with rather broad jokes
and put on something the rakehelly air that
we see now and then assumed on the stage by
the sadboy gentleman the old school ah
your honour said the girl with a malicious
leer you were not in such a tantrum last year
when i told you about the widow you know
who but if you had taken a friend's advice you'd
never have come away from doncaster races
with a flea in your ear
there was a secret sting in this speech that
seemed quite to disconcert master simon he
jerked away his hand in a pet smacked his
fortune telling
whip whistled to his dogs and intimated that
it was high time to go home the girl however
was determined not to lose her harvest
she made an attack upon me and as i have a
weakness spirit where there is a pretty face
concerned she soon wheedled me out my
money and in return read me a fortune which
if it prove true and i am determined to believe
it will make me one the luckiest men in the
chronicles cupid
i saw that the oxonian was at the bottom 
all this oracular mystery and was disposed to
amuse himself with the general whose tender
approaches to the widow have attracted the
notice the wag i was a little curious however
to know the meaning the dark hints
which had so suddenly disconcerted master simon
 and took occasion to fall in the rear with
the oxonian on our way home when he laughed
heartily at my questions and gave me ample information
on the subject
the truth the matter is that master simon
has met with a sad rebuff since my christfortune
telling
mas visit to the hall he used at that time to
be joked about a widow a fine dashing woman
as he privately informed me i had supposed the
pleasure he betrayed on these occasions resulted
from the usual fondness old bachelors for
being teased about getting married and about
flirting and being fickle and false hearted i
am assured however that master simon had
really persuaded himself the widow had a
kindness for him in consequence which he
had been at some extraordinary expense in new
clothes and had actually got frank bracebridge
to order him a coat from stilts he began to
throw out hints about the importance a man's
settling himself in life before he grew old he
would look grave whenever the widow and
matrimony were mentioned in the same sentence
 and privately asked the opinion 
the squire and parson about the prudence
 marrying a widow with a rich jointure but
who had several children
an important member a great family connexion
cannot harp much upon the theme 
fortune telling 
matrimony without its taking wind and it soon
got buzzed about that mr simon bracebridge
was actually gone to doncaster races with a
new horse but that he meant to return in a
curricle with a lady by his side master simon
did indeed go to the races and that with a new
horse and the dashing widow did make her
appearance in her curricle but it was unfortunately
driven by a strapping young irish dragoon
 with whom even master simon's selfcom
placenta would not allow him to venture into
competition and to whom she was married shortly
after
it was a matter sore chagrin to master simon
for several months having never before
been so fully committed the dullest head in
the family had a joke upon him and there is no
one that likes less to be bantered than an absolute
joker
he took refuge for a time at old lady lillycraft's
until the matter should blow over and
occupied himself by overlooking her accounts
regulating the village choir and teaching a bullfinch
to whistle god save the king
 fortune telling
he has now pretty nearly recovered from the
mortification holds up his head and laughs as
much as any one affects to pity married men
and is particularly facetious about widows when
lady lillycraft is not by his only time 
trial is when the general gets hold him who
is infinitely heavy and persevering in his waggery
and will interweave a dull joke through
the various topics a whole dinner time master
simon often parries these attacks by a stanza
from his old work cupid's solicitor for
love
tis in vain to woo a widow over long
in once or twice her mind you may perceive 
widows are subtle be they old or young
and by their wiles young men they will deceive

come do not weep my girl
forget him pretty pensiveness there will
come others every day as good as he
sir j suckling
the approach a wedding in a family is
always an event great importance but particularly
so in a household like this in a retired
part the country master simon who is a
pervading spirit and through means the butler
and housekeeper knows every thing that
goes forward tells me that the maid servants are
continually trying their fortunes and that the
servants hall has late been quite a scene 
incantation it is amusing to notice how the
oddities the head a family flow down
through all the branches the squire in the
indulgence his love every thing that
 love charms
smacks old times has held so many grave
conversations with the parson at table about
popular superstitions and traditional rites that
they have been carried from the parlour to the
kitchen by the listening domestics and being
apparently sanctioned by such highauthority
the whole house has become infected by them
the servants are all versed in the common
modes trying luck and the charms to ensure
constancy they read their fortunes by drawing
strokes in the ashes or by repeating a form
 words and looking in a pail water st
mark's eve i am told was a busy time with
them being an appointed night for certain mystic
ceremonies several them sowed hemp
seed to be reaped by their true lovers they
even ventured upon the solemn and fearful preparation
 the dumb cake this must be done
fasting and in silence the ingredients are
handed down in traditional form an eggshell
full salt an egg shell full malt and
an egg shell full barley meal when the
cake is ready it is put upon a pan over the fire
love charms 
and the future husband will appear turn the
cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a
fast is broken during this awful ceremony
there is no knowing what horrible consequences
would ensue the experiments in the present
instance came to no result they that sowed the
hemp seed forgot the magic rhyme that they
were to pronounce so the true lover never appeared
 and as to the dumb cake what between
the awful stillness they had to keep and the
awfulness the midnight hour their hearts
failed them when they had put the cake on the
pan and seized with a sudden panic they all
ran out the room and did not return until
morning when they found the mystic cake
burnt to a cinder
the most persevering at these spells however
is phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's niece
as she is a kind privileged personage and
rather idle she has more time to occupy herself
with these matters she has always had her
head full love and matrimony she knows
the dream by heart and is quite an oracle

among the little girls the family who always
come to her to interpret their dreams in the
mornings
during the present gayety the house however
the poor girl has gone about with a face
full trouble and to use the housekeeper's
words has fallen into a sad hysterics way
lately it seems that she was born and brought
up in the village where her father was parish
clerk and she was an early playmate and
sweetheart young jack tibbets since she
has come to live at the hall however her head
has been a little turned being very pretty
and naturally genteel she has been much noticed
and indulged and being the housekeeper's
niece she has held an equivocal station between
a servant and a companion she has learned
something fashions and notions among the
young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis
 insomuch that her finery at church
on sundays has given mortal offence to her former
intimates in the village this has occasioned
the misrepresentations which have away
charms 
kened the implacable family pride dame
tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a
spice coquetry in her disposition showed it
on one or two occasions to her lover which produced
a downright quarrel and jack being very
proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back
upon her for several successive sundays
the poor girl is full sorrow and repentance
and would fain make up with her lover 
but he feels his security and stands aloof in
this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother 
who is continually reminding him what he owes
to his family for this same family pride seems
doomed to be the eternal bane lovers as 
hate to see a pretty face in trouble i have felt
quite concerned for poor phoebe ever since i
have heard her story am told that the coolness
 young ready money is very heavy at
her heart instead singing about the house
as formerly she goes about pale and sighing
and is very apt to break into tears when her
companions are full merriment
mrs hannah the vestal gentlewoman my
 love charms
lady lillycraft has had long talks with phoebe
and has endeavoured to squeeze some her
own verjuice into the other one's milky nature
she speaks with contempt and abhorrence the
whole sex and advises phoebe to despise all the
men as she does but phoebe's loving temper
is not to be curdled there is no such thing as
hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole
composition her only thoughts are how to
conciliate and reclaim her lover
the spells and love charms which are matters
 sport to the other domestics are serious concerns
with this lovestricken lass she is continually
trying her fortune in a variety ways
i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six
wednesdays and three fridays successively
having understood that it was a sovereign charm
to ensure being married to one's liking within
the year she carries about also a lock her
sweetheart's hair and a ribband he once gave
her being a mode producing constancy in
love she even went so far as to try her fortune
by the moon which has always had much to do
love charms
with lovers dreams and fancies for this purpose
she went out in the night the full moon
knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the
old traditional rhyme 
all hail to thee moon all hail to thee
i pray thee good moon now show to me
the youth who my future husband shall be
when she came back to the house she was faint
and pale and went immediately to bed the next
morning she told her companions that she had
seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow
which she was sure was young tibbets at any
rate she had dreamt him all night both 
which she was assured were most happy signs
it has since turned out that the person in the
meadow was old christy the huntsman who
was walking his nightly rounds with the great
stag hound so that phoebe's faith in the charm
is completely shaken

yesterday the fair julia made her first appearance
down stairs since her accident and the
sight her spread a universal cheerfulness
through die household she was extremely
pale however and could not walk without pain
and difficulty she was assisted therefore to a
sopha in the library which is pleasant and retired
looking out among trees and so quiet that the
little birds came hopping upon the windows and
peering curiously into the apartment
here several the family gathered round and
devised ways to amuse her and make the day pass
pleasantly lady lillycraft lamented the want
 some new novel to while away the time and
was almost in a pet because the author 
waverley had not produced a work for the last
three months
there was a motion made to call on the parson

for some his old legends or ghost stories but

at length the captain bethought himself and
said he believed he had a manuscript tale lying
in one corner his campaigning trunk which if
he could find and the company were desirous
he would read to them the offer was eagerly
accepted he retired and soon returned with a
roll blotted manuscript in a very gentlemanlike
but nearly illegible hand and a great part
written on cartridge paper
it is one the scribbling said he u 
my poor friend charles lightly the dragoons
he was a curious romantic studious
fanciful fellow the favourite and often the
unconscious butt his fellow officers who entertained
themselves with his eccentricities he
 the library
was in some the hardest service on the peninsula
and distinguished himself by his gallantry
when the intervals duty permitted he
was fond roving about the country visiting
noted places and was extremely curious about
moorish ruins when at his quarters he was a
great scribbler and passed much his leisure
with his pen in his hand
as i was a much younger officer and a
very young man he took me in a manner
under his care and we became close friends he
used often to read his writings to me having a
great confidence in my taste for i always
praised them poor fellow he was shot
down close by me at waterloo we lay wounded
together for some time during a hard contest
that took place near at hand as i was least
hurt i tried to relieve him and to stanch the
blood which flowed from a wound in his breast
he lay with his head in my lap and looked up
thankfully in my face but shook his head faintly
and made a sign that it was all over with
him and indeed he died a few minutes afterthe
library 
wards just as our men had repulsed the enemy
and came to our relief i have his favourite
dog and his pistols to this day and several 
his manuscripts which he gave to me at different
times the one i am now going to read
is a tale which he told me he wrote in spain
during the time that he lay ill a wound received
at salamanca
we now arranged ourselves to hear the story
the captain seated himself on the sofa beside
the fair julia who i had noticed to be somewhat
affected by the picture he had carelessly
drawn wounds and dangers in a field battle
she now leaned her arm fondly on his
shoulder and her eye glistened as it rested on
the manuscript the poor literary dragoon
lady lillycraft had a deep wellcushioned elbow
chair wheeled up for her accommodation
her dogs were nestled on soft mats at her feet 
and the gallant general took his station in an
arm chair at her side and toyed with her ladyship's

once upon a time in the ancient city granada
there sojourned a young student salamanca
 the name antonio de castro he
was pursuing a course reading in the library
 the university and at the same time indulging
his curiosity by examining those remains 
moorish magnificence for which granada is renowned
while occupied in his studies he frequently
noticed an old man singular appearance
who was likewise a visiter at the library
 

 the student salamanca
he was lean and withered apparently more from
study than age his eyes though bright and
visionary were sunk in his head and thrown into
shade by overhanging eyebrows his dress was
always the same a black doublet a short
black cloak very rusty and threadbare red
stockings a small ruff and a large overshadowing
hat
his appetite for knowledge seemed insatiable
he would pass whole days in the library absorbed
in study consulting a multiplicity authors
 as though he were pursuing some interesting
subject through all its ramifications so
that in general when evening came he was
almost buried among books and manuscripts
the curiosity antonio was excited and hei
inquired the attendants concerning the stranger
no one could give him any information
excepting that he had been for some time past a
casual frequenter the library that his reading
lay chiefly among works treating the occult
sciences and that he was particularly curious
in his inquiries after arabian manuscripts they
added that he never held communication with
o
the student salamanca 
any one excepting to ask for particular works 
that after a fit studious application he would
disappear for several days and even weeks and
when he revisited the library he would look more
withered and haggard than ever
the student felt interested by this account 
he was leading rather a desultory life and had
all that capricious curiosity which springs up in
idleness he determined to make himself acquainted
with this bookworm and find out who
and what he was
the next time that he saw the old man at the
library he commenced his approaches by requesting
permission to peruse one the volumes with
which the unknown appeared to have finished
the latter merely bowed his head in token 
assent after pretending to look through the
volume with great attention he returned it with
many acknowledgments the stranger made
no reply
may i ask senor said antonio with some
hesitation may i ask what you are searching
after in all these books 
 the student salamanca
the old man raised his head with an expression
 surprise at having his studies interrupted
for the first time arid by so intrusive a question
he surveyed the student with a side glance from
head to foot wisdom my son said he calmly
 and the search requires every moment 
my attention he then cast his eyes upon his
 and resumed his studies but father
said antonio cannot you spare a moment to
point out the road to others it is to experienced
travellers like you that we strangers in the paths
 knowledge must look for directions on our
journey
the stranger looked disturbed i have not
time enough my son to learn said he much
less to teach i am ignorant myself the path
 true knowledge how then can i show it to
others 
well but father 
senor said the old man mildly but earnestly
you must see that i have but few steps
more to the grave in that short space have i
to accomplish the whole business my existence
the student salamanca 
i have no time for words every word is as one
grain sand my glass wasted suffer me to
be alone
there was no replying to so complete a closing
 the door intimacy the student found
himself calmly but totally repulsed though
curious and inquisitive yet he was naturally
modest and on after thoughts he blushed at his
own intrusion his mind soon became occupied
by other objects he passed several days wandering
among the mouldering piles moorish
architecture those melancholy monuments an
elegant and voluptuous people he paced the
deserted halls the alhambra the paradise 
the moorish kings he visited the great court
 the lions famous for the perfidious massacre
 the gallant abencerrages he gazed with
admiration at its mosaic cupolas gorgeously
painted in gold and azure its basins marble 
its alabaster vase supported by lions and storied
with inscriptions
his imagination kindled as he wandered
among these scenes they were calculated to
awaken all the enthusiasm a youthful mind
 the student salamanca
most the halls have anciently been beautified
by fountains the fine taste the arabs delighted
in the sparkling purity and reviving
freshness water and they erected as it were
altars on every side to that delicate element
poetry mingles with architecture in the al alhambra
it breathes along the very walls whereever
antonio turned his eye he beheld inscriptions
in arabic wherein the perpetuity moorish
power and splendour within these walls was
confidently predicted alas how had the prophecy
been falsified many the basins where
the fountains had once thrown up their sparkling
showers were dry and dusty some the
palaces were turned into gloomy convents and
the barefoot monk paced through those courts
which had once glittered with the array and
echoed to the music moorish chivalry
in the course his rambles the student more
than once encountered the old man the library
he was always alone and so full 
thought as not to notice any one about him
he appeared to be intent upon studying those
the student salamanca 
half buried inscriptions which are found here
and there among the moorish ruins and seem
to murmur from the earth the tale former
greatness the greater part these have since
been translated but they were supposed by
many at the time to contain symbolical revelations
and golden maxims the arabian sages
and astrologers
as antonio saw the stranger apparently decy
peering these inscriptions he felt an eager longing
to make his acquaintance and to participate
in his curious researches but the repulse he had
met with at the library deterred him from making
any farther advances
he had directed his steps one evening to the
sacred mount which overlooks the beautiful valley
watered by the darro the fertile plain the
vega and all that rich diversity vale and
mountain that surrounds granada with an earthly
paradise it was twilight when he found himself
at the place where at the present day are
situated the chapels known by the name the
sacred furnaces they are so called from
vol i 
 the student salamanca
grottoes in which some the primitive saints
are said to have been burnt at the time antonio's
visit the place was an object much
curiosity in an excavation these grottoes
several manuscripts had recently been discovered
engraved on plates lead they were written
in the arabian language excepting one which
was in unknown characters the pope had
issued a bull forbidding any one under pain 
excommunication to speak these manuscripts
the prohibition had only excited the greater
curiosity and many reports were whispered
about that these manuscripts contained treasures
 dark and forbidden knowledge
as antonio was examining the place from
whence these mysterious manuscripts had been
drawn he again observed the old man the
library wandering among the ruins his curiosity
was now fully awakened the time and
place served to stimulate it he resolved to watch
this unknown groper after secret and forgotten
lore and to trace him to his habitation there
was something like adventure in the thing that
the student salamanca 
charmed his romantic disposition he followed
the stranger therefore at a little distance at
first cautiously but he soon observed him to be
so wrapped in his own thoughts as to take little
heed external objects they passed along
the skirts the mountain and then by the shady
banks the darro they pursued their way
for some distance from granada along a lonely
road that led among the hills the gloom 
evening was gathering and it was quite dark
when the stranger stopped at the portal a solitary
mansion
it appeared to be a mere wing or ruined fragment
 what had once been a pile some consequence
the walls were great thickness
the windows narrow and generally secured by
iron bars the door was planks studded
with iron spikes and had been great strength
though at present it was much decayed atone
 the mansion was a ruinous tower in
the moorish style architecture the edifice
had probably been a country retreat or castle 
pleasure during the occupation granada by
 the student salamanca
the moors and rendered sufficiently strong to
withstand any casual assault in those warlike
times
the old man knocked at the portal a light appeared
at a small window just above it and a
female head looked out it might have served
as a model for one raphael's saints the
hair was beautifully braided and gathered in a
silken net and the complexion as well as could
be judged from the light was that soft rich brunette
so becoming in southern beauty
it is i my child said the old man the
face instantly disappeared and soon after a
wicket door in the large portal opened antonio
who had ventured near to the building caught a
transient sight a delicate female form a pair
 fine black eyes darted a look surprise at
seeing a stranger hovering near and the door
was precipitately closed
there was something in this sudden gleam 
beauty that wonderfully struck the imagination
 the student it was like a brilliant flashing
from its dark casket he sauntered about re
tee student salamanca 
harding the gloomy pile with increasing interest
a few simple wild notes from among some rocks
and trees at a little distance attracted his attention
he found there a group giants a
vagabond gipsy race that at that time abounded
in spain and lived in hovels and caves the
hills about the neighbourhood granada some
were busy about a fire others were listening to
the uncouth music which one their companions
seated on a ledge the rock was making
with a split reed
antonio endeavoured to obtain some information
 them concerning the old building and its
inhabitants
the one who appeared to be their spokesman
was a gaunt fellow with a subtle gait a whispering
voice and a sinister roll the eye he
shrugged his shoulders on the student's inquiries
and said that all was not right in that building
an old man inhabited it whom nobody knew
and whose family appeared to be only his daughter
and a female servant he and his companions
he added lived up among the neighbouring
 the student salamanca
hills and as they had been about at night they
had often seen strange lights and heard strange
sounds from the tower some the country
people who worked in the vineyards among the
hills believed the old man to be one that dealt in
the black art and were not over fond passing
near the tower at night but for our parts
said the gitano we are not a people that trouble
ourselves much with fears that kind
the student endeavoured to gain more precise
information but they had none to furnish
him they began to be solicitous for a compensation
for what they had already imparted and
recollecting the loneliness the place and the
vagabond character his companions he was
glad to give them a gratuity and to hasten homewards

he sat down to his studies but his brain was
too full what he had seen and heard his eye
was upon the page but his fancy still returned to
the tower and he was continually picturing the
little window with the beautiful head peeping
out or the door half open and the nymphlike
form within
the student salamanca 
he retired to bed but the same objects
haunted his dreams he was young and susceptible
 and the excited state his feelings from
wandering among the abodes departed grace
and gallantry had predisposed him for a sudden
impression from female beauty
the next morning he strolled again in the direction
 the tower it was still more forlorn
by the broad glare day than in the gloom 
evening the walls were crumbling and weeds
and moss were growing in every crevice it
had the look a prison rather than a dwelling
house in one angle however he remarked a
window which seemed an exception to the surrounding
squalidness there w z as a curtain
drawn within it and flowers standing on the
window stone whilst he was looking at it the
curtain was partially withdrawn and a delicate
white arm the most beautiful roundness was
put forth to water the flowers
the student made a noise to attract the attention
 the fair florist he succeeded the
curtain was farther drawn and he had a glance
 the student salamanca
 the same face he had seen the evening before
 it was but a mere glance the curtain
again fell and the casement closed all this
was calculated to excite the feelings a romantic
youth had he seen the unknown under
other circumstances it is probable that he would
not have been struck with her beauty but this
appearance being shut up and kept apart
gave her the value a treasured gem he passed
and repassed before the house several times
in the course the day but saw nothing more
he was there again in the evening the whole
aspect the house was dreary the narrow
windows emitted no rays cheerful light to indicate
that there was social life within antonio
listened at the portal but no sound voices
reached his ear just then he heard the clapping
to a distant door and fearing to be detected
in the unworthy act eavesdropping
he precipitately drew off to the opposite side 
the road and stood in the shadow a ruined
archway
he now remarked a light from a window in
the student salamanca 
the tower it was fitful and changeable commonly
feeble and yellowish as if from a lamp
with an occasional glare some vivid metallic
colour followed by a dusky glow a column
 dense smoke would now and then rise in the
air and hang like a canopy over the tower
there was altogether such a loneliness and
seeming mystery about the building and its inhabitants
that antonio was half inclined to indulge
the country people's notions and to fancy it the
den some powerful sorcerer and the fair damsel
he had seen some spellbound beauty
after some time had elapsed a light appeared
in the window where he had seen the beautiful
arm the curtain was down but it was so
thin that he could perceive the shadow someone
passing and repassing between it and the
light he fancied that he could distinguish
that the form was delicate and from the alacrity
 its movements it was evidently youthful
he had not a doubt but this was the bed chamber
 his beautiful unknown
presently he heard the sound a guitar and
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a female voice singing he drew near cautiously
and listened it was a plaintive moorish
ballad and he recognized in it the lamentations
 one the abencerrages on leaving the
walls lovely granada it was full passion
ad tenderness it spoke the delights
 early life the hours love it had enjoyed
on the banks the darro and among the
blissful abodes the alhambra it bewailed
the fallen honours the abencerrages and imprecated
vengeance on their oppressors antonio
was affected by the music it singularly
coincided with the place it was like the voice
 past times echoed in the present and breathing
among the monuments its departed glories

the voice ceased after a time the light disappeared
and all was still she sleeps said
antonio fondly he lingered about the building
with the devotion with which a lover lingers
about the bower sleeping beauty the rising
moon threw its silver beams on the gray
walls and glittered on the casement the
the student salamanca 
late gloomy landscape gradually became flooded
with its radiance finding therefore that he
could no longer move about in obscurity and
fearful that his loitering might be observed he
reluctantly retired
the curiosity which had at first drawn the
young man to the tower was now seconded by
feelings a more romantic kind his studies
were almost entirely abandoned he maintained
a kind blockade the old mansion he
would take a with him and pass a great
part the day under the trees in its vicinity 
keeping a vigilant eye upon it and endeavouring
to ascertain what were the walks his mysterious
charmer he found however that she
never went out except to mass when she was
accompanied by her father he waited at the
door the church and offered her the holy
water in the hopes touching her hand a little
office gallantry common in catholic countries
she however modestly declined without raising
her eyes to see who made the offer and always
took it herself from the font she was attentive
 the student salamanca
in her devotion her eyes were never taken from
the altar or the priest and on returning home
her countenance was almost entirely concealed
by her mantilla
antonio had now carried on the pursuit for
several days and was hourly getting more and
more interested in the pursuit but never a step
nearer to the game his lurking about the
house had probably been noticed for he no longer
saw the fair face at the window nor the white
arm put forth to water the flowers
his only consolation was to repair nightly to
his post observation listen to her warbling
and if by chance he could catch a sight her
shadow passing and repassing before the window
he thought himself most fortunate
as he was indulging in one these evening
vigils which were complete revels the imagination
the sound approaching footsteps made
him withdraw into the deep shadow the ruined
archway opposite to the tower a cavalier
approached wrapped in a large spanish cloak
he paused under the window the tower
the student op salamanca 
after a little while began a serenade accompanied
by his guitar in the usual style spanish
gallantry his voice was rich and manly he
touched the instrument with skill and sang
with amorous and impassioned eloquence
the plume his hat was buckled by jewels
that sparkled in the moon beams and as he
played on the guitar his cloak falling off from
one shoulder showed him to be richly dressed
it was evident that he was a person rank
the idea now flashed across antonio's mind
that the affections his unknown beauty might
be engaged she was young and doubtless susceptible
and it was not in the nature spanish
females to be deaf and insensible to music and
admiration the surmise brought with it a
feeling dreariness there vas a pleasant
dream several days suddenly dispelled he
had never before experienced any thing the
tender passion and as its morning dreams are
always delightful he would fain have continued
in the delusion
u but what have i to do with her attached
the student salamanca
ments thought he i have no claim on her
heart nor even on her acquaintance how do
i know that she is worthy affection or if
she is must not so gallant a lover as this with
his jewels his rank and his detestable music
have completely captivated her what idle
humour is this that i have fallen into i must
again to my books study study will soon
chase away all these idle fancies
the more he thought however the more he
became entangled in the spell which his lively
imagination had woven round him and now
that a rival had appeared in addition to the
other obstacles that environed this enchanted
beauty she appeared ten times more lovely and
desirable it was some slight consolation to
him to perceive that the gallantry the unknown
met with no apparent return from the
tower the light at the window was extinguished
 the curtain remained undrawn and
none the customary signals were given to
intimate that the serenade was accepted
the cavalier lingered for some time about the
the student salamanca 
place and sang several other tender airs with a
taste and feeling that made antonio's heartache
at length he slowly retired the student
remained with folded arms leaning against the
ruined arch endeavouring to summon up resolution
enough to depart but there was a romantic
fascination that still enchained him to the
place it is the last time said he willing to
compromise between his feelings and his judgment
 it is the last time then let me enjoy
the dream a few moments longer
as his eye ranged about the old building to
take a farewell look he observed the strange
light in the tower which he had noticed on a
former occasion it kept beaming up and declining
as before a pillar smoke rose in the
air and hung in sable volumes it was evident
the old man was busied in some those operations
that had gained him the reputation a
sorcerer throughout the neighbourhood
suddenly an intense and brilliant glare shone
through the casement followed by a loud report
and then a fierce and ruddy glow a figure 
the student salamanca
feared at the window uttering cries agony or
alarm but immediately disappeared and a body
 smoke and flame whirled out the narrow
aperture antonio rushed to the portal and
knocked at it with vehemence he was only
answered by loud shrieks and found that the
females were ready in helpless consternation
with an exertion desperate strength he forced
the wicket from its hinges and rushed into the
house
he found himself in a small vaulted hall and
by the light the moon which entered at the
door he saw a stairs to the left he hurried up
it to a narrow corridor through which was ruling
a volume smoke he found here the
two females in a frantic state alarm one 
them clasped her hands and implored him to save
her father
the corridor terminated in a small spiral staircase
leading up to the tower he sprang up it
to a small door through the chinks which
came a glow light and smoke was spurning
out he burst it open and found himself in an
he student salamanca 
antique vaulted chamber furnished with furnace
and various chemical apparatus a shattered
retort lay on the stone floor a quantity combustibles
nearly consumed with various half
burnt books and papers were sending up an expiring
flame and filling the chamber with stifling
smoke just within the threshold lay the reputed
conjurer he was bleeding his clothes
were scorched and he appeared lifeless antonio
caught him up and bore him down the
stairs to a chamber in which there was a light
and laid him on a bed
the female domestic was despatched for such
appliances as the house afforded but the daughter
threw herself frantically beside her parent
and could not be reasoned out her alarm her
dress was all in disorder her dishevelled hair
hung in rich confusion about her neck and bosom
 and never was there beheld a lovelier picture
 terror and affliction
the skilful assiduities the scholar soon produced
signs returning animation in his patient
the old man's wounds though severe
vol j 
 the student salamanca
were not dangerous they bad evidently been
produced by the bursting the retort in his
bewilderment he had been enveloped in the stifling
metallic vapours which had overpowered
his feeble frame and had not antonio arrived to
his assistance it is probable he would never have
recovered
by slow degrees he came to his senses he
looked about with a bewildered air at the chamber
the agitated group around and the student
who was leaning over him
where am i said he wildly at the
sound his voice his daughter uttered a faint
exclamation delight my poor inez said
he embracing her then putting his hand to his
head and taking it away stained with blood he
seemed suddenly to recollect himself and to be
overcome with emotion
aye cried he all is over with me all
gone all vanished gone in a moment the
labour a lifetime lost
his daughter attempted to soothe him but he
became slightly delirious and raved incoherently
the student salamanca 
about malignant demons and about the habitation
 the green lion being destroyed his
wounds being dressed and such other remedies
administered as his situation required he sank
into a state quiet antonio now turned his
attention to the daughter whose sufferings had
been little inferior to those her father having
with great difficulty succeeded in tranquillizing
her fears he endeavoured to prevail upon
her to retire and seek the repose so necessary to
her frame proffering to remain by her father
until morning i am a stranger said he it is
true and my offer may appear intrusive but
i see you are lonely and helpless and i cannot
help venturing over the limits mere ceremony
should you feel any scruple or doubt however
say but a word and i will instantly retire
there was a frankness a kindness and a
modesty mingled in antonio's deportment that
inspired instant confidence and his simple scholar's
garb was a recommendation in the house
 poverty the females consented to resign the
sufferer to his care as they would be the better
able to attend to him on the morrow
 the student salamanca
on retiring the old domestic was profuse in
her benedictions the daughter only looked her
thanks but as they shone through the tears
that filled her fine black eyes the student
thought them a thousand times the most eloquent

here then he was by a singular turn 
chance completely housed within this mysterious
mansion when left to himself and the bustle
 the scene was over his heart throbbed as he
looked round the chamber in which he was sitting
it was the daughter's room the promised
land towards which he had cast so many a longing
gaze the furniture was old and had probably
belonged to the building in its prosperous
days but every thing was arranged with propriety
the flowers that he had seen her attend stood
in the window a guitar leaned against a table
on which stood a crucifix and before it lay a
missal and a rosary there reigned an air 
purity and serenity about this little nestling place
 innocence it was the emblem a chaste
and quiet mind some few articles female
the student op salamanca 
dress lay on the chairs and there was the very
bed on which she had slept the pillow on which
her soft cheek had reclined the poor scholar
was treading enchanted ground for what fairyland
has more magic in it than the bed chamber
 innocence and beauty 
from various expressions the old man in
his ravings and from what he had noticed on a
subsequent visit to the tower to see that the fire
was extinguished antonio had gathered that
his patient was an alchymist the philosopher's
stone was an object eagerly sought after by visionaries
in those days but in consequence 

the superstitious prejudices the times and the
frequent persecutions its votaries they were
apt to pursue their experiments in secret in
lonely houses in caverns and ruins or in the
privacy cloistered cells
in the course the night the old man had
several fits restlessness and delirium he would
call out upon theophrastus and geber and
albertus magnus and other sages his art 
and anon would murmur about fermentation
 the student salamanca
and x projection until towards daylight he once
more sank into a salutary sleep
when the morning sun darted his rays into
the casement the fair inez attended by the female
domestic came blushing into the chamber
the student now took his leave having himself
need repose but obtained ready permission to
return and inquire after the sufferer when he
called again he found the alchymist languid
and in pain but apparently suffering more in
mind than in body his delirium had left him
and he had been informed the particulars 
his deliverance and the subsequent attentions
 the scholar he could do little more than
look his thanks but antonio did not require
them his own heart repaid him for all that he
had done and he almost rejoiced in the disaster
that had gained him an entrance into this mysterious
habitation
the alchymist was so helpless as to need
much assistance antonio remained with him
therefore the greater part the day he repeated
his visit the next day and the next
the student salamanca 
every day his company seemed more pleasing
to the invalid and every day he felt his interest
in the latter increasing perhaps the presence
 the daughter might have been at the
bottom this solicitude
he had frequent and long conversations with
the alchymist he found him as men his
pursuits were apt to be a mixture enthusiasm
and simplicity curious and extensive
reading on points little utility with great
inattention to the every day occurrences life
and profound ignorance the world he was
deeply versed in singular and obscure branches
 knowledge and much given to visionary
speculations antonio whose mind was a
romantic cast had himself given some attention
to the occult sciences and entered upon
those themes with an ardour that delighted the
philosopher their conversations frequently
turned upon astrology divination and the great
secret the old man would forget his aches
and wounds rise up like a spectre in his bed
and kindle into eloquence on his favourite 
the student salamanca
pics when gently admonished his situation
it would but prompt him to another sally
 thought alas r my son he would say
is not this very decrepitude and suffering
another proof the importance those secrets
with which we are surrounded why
are we trammelled by disease withered by old
age and our spirits quenched as it were within
us but because we have lost those secrets 
life and youth which were known to our parents
before their fall to regain these have philosophers
been ever since aspiring but just as
they are on the point securing the precious
secrets for ever the brief period life is at an
 they die and with them all their wisdom
and experience nothing as de nuysment
observes nothing is wanting for man's perfection
but a longer life less crost with sorrows
and maladies to the attaining the full
and perfect knowledge things
at length antonio so far gained on the heart
 his patient as to draw from him the outlines
 his story
the student salamanca 
felix de vasquez the alchymist was a native
 castile and an ancient and honourable
line early in life he had married a beautiful
female the descendant one the moorish
families the marriage displeased his father
who considered the pure spanish blood contaminated
by this foreign mixture it is true
the lady traced her descent from one the
abencerrages the most gallant moorish cavaliers
who had embraced the christian faith
on being exiled from the walls granada
the injured pride the father however was
not to be appeased he never saw his son
afterwards and on dying left him but a scanty
portion his estate bequeathing the residue
in the piety and bitterness his heart to the
erection convents and the performance 
masses for souls in purgatory don felix resided
for a long time in the neighbourhood 
valladolid in a state embarrassment and obscurity
he devoted himself to intense study 
having while at the university salamanca
imbibed a taste for the secret sciences he was
vol r 
 the student salamanca
enthusiastic and speculative he went on from
one branch knowledge to another until he
became zealous in the search after the grand
arcanum
he had at first engaged in the pursuit with the
hopes raising himself from his present obscurity
and resuming the rank arid dignity to which
his birth entitled him but as usual it ended in
absorbing every thought and becoming the business
 his existence he was at length aroused
from this mental abstraction by the calamities 
his household a malignant fever swept off his
wife and all his children excepting an infant
daughter these losses for a time overwhelmed
and stupefied him his home had in a manner
died away from around him and he felt lonely
and forlorn when his spirit revived within him
he determined to abandon the scene his humiliation
and disaster to bear away the child
that was still left him beyond the scene contagion
 and never to return to castile until he
should be enabled to reclaim the honour his
line
the student salamanca 
he had ever since been wandering and unsettled
in his abode sometimes the resident populous
cities at other times absolute solitudes
he had searched libraries meditated on inscriptions
 visited adepts different countries and
sought to gather and concentrate the raps which
had been thrown by various minds upon the secrets
 alchymy he had at one time travelled
quite to padua to search for the manuscripts 
pietro d'abano and to inspect an urn which
had been dug up near este supposed to have
been buried by maximus olibius and to have
contained the great elixir
while at padua he had met with an adept
versed in arabian lore who talked the invaluable
this urn was found in it contained a lesser one
in which was a burning lamp betwixt two small vials the one 
gold the other silver both them full a very clear liquor on
the largest was an inscription stating that maximus olibius shut up in
this small vessel elements which he had prepared with great toil
there were many disquisitions among the learned on the subject it
was the most received opinion that this maximus olibius was an inhabitant
 padua that he had discovered the great secret and that
these vessels contained liquor one to transmute metals to gold the
other to silver the peasants who found thee urns imagining this
precious liquor to be common water spilt every drop so that the art
 transmuting metals remains as much a secret as ever
 the student salamanca
able manuscripts that must remain in the spanish
libraries preserved from the spoils the
moorish academies and universities the probability
 meeting with precious unpublished
writings geber and alfarabius and avicenna
the great physicians the arabian schools who
it was well known had treated much alchymy
 but above all he spoke the arabian
tablets lead which had recently been dug up
in the neighbourhood granada and which
contained the lost secrets the art
the indefatigable alchymist once more bent
his steps for spain full renovated hope he
had made his way to granada he had wearied
himself in the study arabic in decyphering
inscriptions in rummaging libraries and exploring
every possible trace left by the arabian
sages
in all his wanderings he had been accompanied
by inez through the rough and the smooth the
pleasant and the adverse never complaining but
rather seeking to sooth his cares by her innocent
and playful caresses her instruction had been
the student salamanca 
the employment and the delight his hours 
relaxation she had grown up while they were
wandering and had scarcely ever known any
home but by his side he was family friends
home every thing to her he had carried her
in his arms when they first began their wayfaring 
had nestled her as an eagle does its young
among the rocky heights the sierra morea
she had sported about him in childhood in the
solitudes the bateucas had followed him asa
lamb does the shepherd over the rugged pyrenees
and into the fair plains languedoc and
now she was grown up to support his feeble steps
among the ruined abodes her maternal ancestors

his property had gradually wasted away in
the course his travels and his experiments
still hope the constant attendant the alchymist
led him on ever on the point reaping
the reward his labours and ever disappointed
with the credulity that often attended his art
he attributed many his disappointments to the
machinations the malignant spirits that beset
 the student salamanca
the path the alchymist and torment him in his
solitary labours
it is their constant endeavour he observed to
close up every avenue to those sublime truths
which would enable man to rise above the abject
state into which he had fallen and to return to
his original perfection to the evil offices 
these demons he attributed his late disaster he
had been on the very verge the glorious discovery
 never were the indications more completely
auspicious all was going on prosperously
when at the critical moment which should
have crowned all his labours with success and
have placed him at the very summit human
power and felicity the bursting a retort had
reduced his laboratory and himself to ruin
i must now said he give up at the very
threshold success my books and papers are
burnt my apparatus is broken i am too old
to bear up against these evils the ardour that
once inspired me is gone my poor frame is exhausted
by study and watchfulness and this last
misfortune has hurried me towards the grave
the student salamanca 
he concluded in a tone deep dejection
antonio endeavoured to comfort and reassure
him but the poor alchymist had for once
awakened to a consciousness the worldly ills
that were gathering around him and had sunk
into despondency after a pause and some
thoughtfulness and perplexity brow antonio
ventured to make a proposal
i have long said he been filled with a
love for the secret sciences but have felt too ignorant
and diffident to give myself up to them
you have acquired experience you have amassed
the knowledge a lifetime it were a 
should be thrown away you say you are too
old to renew the toils the laboratory suffer
me to undertake them add your knowledge
to my youth and activity and what shall we not
accomplish as a probationary fee and a fund
on which to proceed i will bring into the common
stock a sum gold the residue a legacy
which has enabled me to complete my education
a poor scholar cannot boast much but i
trust we shall soon put ourselves beyond the
 the student salamanca
reach want and if we should fail why 
must depend like other scholars upon my brains
to carry me through the world
the philosopher's spirits were however
more depressed than the student had imagined
this last shock following in the rear so
many disappointments had almost destroyed
the reaction his mind the fire an enthusiast
however is never so low but that it maybe
blown again into a flame by degrees the
old man was cheered and reanimated by the
buoyancy and ardour his sanguine companion
he at length agreed to accept the services 
the student and once more to renew his experiments
he objected however to using the
student's gold notwithstanding that his own
was nearly exhausted but this objection was
soon overcome the student insisted on making
it a common stock and common cause and
then how absurd was any delicacy about such
a trifle with men who looked forward to discovering
the philosopher's stone
while therefore the alchymist was slowly
the student salamanca 
recovering the student busied himself in getting
the laboratory once more in order it was
strewed with the wrecks retorts and alembics
 with old crucibles boxes and phials 
powders and tinctures and half burnt books
and manuscripts
as soon as the old man was sufficiently recovered
the studies and experiments were renewed
the student became a privileged and
frequent visiter and was indefatigable in his
toils in the laboratory the philosopher daily
derived new zeal and spirits from the animation
 his disciple he was now enabled to prosecute
the enterprise with continued exertion
having so active a coadjutor to divide the toil
while he was poring over the writings sands
and philalethes and dominus de nuys
ment and endeavouring to comprehend the symbolical
language in which they have locked up
their inscrutable mysteries antonio would occupy
himself among the retorts and crucibles
and keep the furnace in a perpetual glow
with all his zeal however for the discovery
vol i 
 the student salamanca
 the golden art the feelings the student had
not cooled as to the object that first drew him
to this ruinous mansion during the old man's
illness he had frequent opportunities being
near the daughter and every day made him
more sensible to her charms there was a pure
simplicity and an almost passive gentleness in
her manners yet with all this was mingled something
whether mere maiden shyness or a consciousness
 high descent or a dash castilian
pride or perhaps all united which prevented
undue familiarity and made her difficult approach

the danger her father and the measures to
be taken for his relief had at first overcome this
coyness and reserve but as he recovered and her
alarm subsided she seemed to shrink from the
familiarity she had indulged with the youthful
stranger and to become every day more shy
and silent
antonio had read many books but this was
the first volume woman kind that he had
ever studied he had been captivated with the
the student salamanca 
very title page but the farther he read the
more he was delighted she seemed formed to
love her soft black eye rolled languidly under
its long silken lashes and wherever it turned it
would linger and repose there was tenderness
in every beam to him alone she was reserved
and distant now that the common cares 
the sick room were at an he saw little
more her than before his admission to the
house sometimes he met her on his way to
and from the laboratory and at such times there
was ever a smile and a blush but after a simple
salutation she glided on and disappeared
tis plain thought antonio my presence
is indifferent if not irksome to her she
has noticed my admiration and is determined to
discourage it nothing but a feeling gratitude
prevents her treating me with marked distaste
 and then has she not another lover rich
gallant splendid musical how can i suppose
she would turn her eyes from so brilliant a cavalier
to a poor obscure student raking among the
cinders her father's laboratory 
 the student salamanca
indeed the idea the amorous serenader
continually haunted his mind he felt convinced
that he was a favoured lover yet if so
why did he not frequent the tower why did
he not make his approaches by noonday 
there was mystery in this eavesdropping and
musical courtship surely inez could not be
encouraging a secret intrigue oh no she was
too artless too pure too ingenuous but then
the spanish females were so prone to love and
intrigue and music and moonlight were so seductive
 and inez had such a tender soul languishing
in every look oh would the
poor scholar exclaim clasping his hands if i
could but once behold those lovely eyes beaming
on me with affection
it is incredible to those who have not experienced
it on what scanty aliment human life and
human love may be supported a dry crust
thrown now and then to a starving man will
give him a new lease existence and a faint
smile or a kind look bestowed at casual intervals
will keep a lover loving on when a man in
his sober senses would despair
the student salamanca 
when antonio found himself alone in the laboratory
his mind would be haunted by one 
these looks or smiles which he had received in
passing he would set it in every possible light
and argue on it with all the selfpleasing selfteasing
logic a lover
the country around him was enough to
awaken that voluptuousness feeling so favourable
to the growth passion the window
 the tower rose above the trees the romantic
valley the darro and looked down
upon some the loveliest scenery the vega 
where the groves citrons and orange were refreshed
by cool springs and brooks the purest
water the xenel and the darro wound their
shining streams along the plain and gleamed
from among its bowers the surrounding hills
were covered with vineyards and the mountains
crowned with snow seemed to melt into the blue
sky the delicate airs that played about the
tower were perfumed by the fragrance myrtle
and orange blossoms and the ear was charmed
with the fond warbling the nightingale which
 the student salamanca
in these happy regions sings the whole day
long sometimes too there was the idle song
 the muleteer sauntering along the solitary
road or the notes the guitar from some
group peasants dancing in the shade all
these were enough to fill the head a young
lover with poetic fancies and antonio would
picture to himself how he could live among those
happy groves and wander by those gentle rivers
and love away his life with inez
he felt at times impatient at his own weakness
and would endeavour to brush away these
cobwebs the mind he would turn his
thoughts with sudden effort to his occult studies
 or occupy himself in some perplexing process
 but often when he had partially succeeded
in fixing his attention the sound inez lute
or the soft notes her voice would come stealing
upon the stillness the chamber and as it
were floating round the tower there was no
great art in her performance but antonio thought
he had never heard music comparable to this
it was perfect witchcraft to hear her warble forth
the student salamanca 
some her national melodies those little spanish
romances and moorish ballads that transport
the hearer in idea to the banks the
guadalquiver or the walls alhambra and
make him dream beauties and balconies and
moonlight serenades
never was poor student more sadly beset than
antonio love is a troublesome companion ina
study at the best times but in the laboratory
 an alchymist his intrusion is terribly disastrous
instead attending to the retorts and
crucibles and watching the process some experiment
entrusted to his charge the student
would get entranced in one these love dreams
from which he would often be aroused by some
fatal catastrophe the philosopher on returning
from his researches in the libraries would
find every thing gone wrong and antonio in despair
over the ruins the whole day's work
the old man however took all quietly for his
had been a life experiments and failure
we must have patience my son would he
say as all the great masters that have gone 
the student salamanca
fore us have had errors arid accidents and
delays are what we have to contend with did
not pontus err two hundred times before he
could obtain even the matter on which to found
his experiments the great flame too did
he not labour four and twenty years before he
ascertained the first agent what difficulties
and hardships did not cartilages encounter
at the very threshold his discoveries and
bernard de trees even after he had attained
a knowledge all the requisites was he not
delayed full three years what you consider
accidents my son are the machinations our
invisible enemies the treasures and golden
secrets nature are surrounded by spirits hostile
to man the air about us teems with them
they lurk in the fire the furnace in the bottom
 the crucible and the alembic and are
ever on the alert to take advantage those
moments when our minds are wandering from
the intense meditation on the great truths that
we are seeking we must only strive the more
to purify ourselves from those gross and earthly
the student salamanca 
feelings which becloud the soul and prevent
her from piercing into nature's arcana
alas thought antonio if to be purified
from all earthly feeling requires that i should
cease to love inez i fear i shall never discover
the philosopher's stone 
in this way matters went on for some time at
the alchymist's day after day was sending the
student's gold in vapour up the chimney every
blast the furnace made him a ducat the
poorer without apparently helping him a jot
nearer the golden secret still the young man
stood by and saw piece after piece disappearing
without a murmur he had daily an opportunity
 seeing inez he felt as if her favour would
be better than silver or gold and that every smile
was worth a ducat
sometimes in the cool the evening when
the toils the laboratory happened to be suspended
he would walk with the alchymist in
what had once been a garden belonging to the
mansion there were still the remains terraces
and balustrades and here and there a
vol i 
 the student salamanca
marble urn or mutilated statue overturned and
buried among weeds and flowers run wild
it was the favourite resort the alchymist in
his hours relaxation where he would give full
scope to his visionary flights his mind was
tinctured with the rosycrucian doctrines he
believed in elementary beings some favourable
others adverse to his pursuits and in the exaltation
 his fancy had often imagined that he
held communion with them in his solitary walks
about the whispering groves and echoing walls
 this old garden when accompanied by antonio
he would prolong these evening recreations
indeed he sometimes did it out consideration
for his disciple for he feared his too close application
and his incessant seclusion in the tower
would be injurious to his health he was delighted
and surprised by this extraordinary zealand
perseverance in so young a tyro and looked
upon him as destined to be one the great luminaries
 the art lest the student should
repine at the time lost in these relaxations the
good alchymist would fill them up with wholethe
student salamanca 
some knowledge in matters connected with their
pursuit and would walk up and down the alleys
with his disciple imparting oral instruction like
an ancient philosopher
in all his visionary schemes there breathed a
spirit lofty though chimerical philanthropy
that won the admiration the scholar
nothing sordid nothing sensual nothing petty
or selfish seemed to enter into his views in respect
to the grand discoveries he was anticipating
on the contrary his imagination kindled
with conceptions widely dispensed happiness
he looked forward to the time when he
should be able to go about the earth relieving the
indigent comforting the distressed and by his
unlimited means devising and executing plans
for the complete extirpation poverty and all its
attendant sufferings and crimes never were
grander schemes for universal good for the distribution
 boundless wealth and universal competence
devised than by this poor indigent alchemist
in his ruined tower
antonio would attend these peripatetic 
the student salamanca
turns with all the ardour a devotee but there
was another circumstance which may have given
a secret charm to them the garden was the
resort also inez where she took her walks 
recreation the only exercise that her secluded
life permitted
as antonio was duteously pacing by the side
 his instructor he would often catch a glimpse
 the daughter walking pensively about the alleys
in the soft twilight sometimes they would
meet her unexpectedly and the heart the
student would throb with agitation a blush
too would crimson the cheek inez but still
she passed on and never joined them
he had remained one evening until rather a
late hour with the alchymist in this favourite
resort it was a delightful night after a sultry
day and the balmy air the garden was peculiarly
reviving the old man was seated on a
fragment a pedestal looking like a part 
the ruin on which he sat he was edifying his
pupil by reading long lessons wisdom from
the stars as they shone out with brilliant lustre
the student op salamanca 
in the dark blue vault a southern sky and
by quoting by memory from behmen and other
 the rosycrucians concerning the signature 
earthly things and passing events which may be
discerned in the heavens the power the
stars over corporeal beings and their influence
in the fortunes the sons men
by degrees the moon arose and shed her
gleaming light among the chequered groves
antonio apparently listened with fixed attention
to the sage but his ear was drinking in the melody
 inez voice who was singing to her lute
in one the moonlight glades the garden
the old man having exhausted his theme sat
gazing in silent reverie at the heavens antonio
could not resist an inclination to steal a look at
this coy beauty that was playing the part the
nightingale so sequestered and musical leaving
the alchymist in his celestial reverie he stole
gently along one the alleys the music had
ceased and he thought he heard the sound 
voices he came to an angle a copse that
had screened a kind green recess ornamented
 the student salamanca
by a marble fountain the moon shone full
upon the place and by its light he beheld his unknown
serenading rival at the feet inez he
was detaining her by the hand which he covered
with kisses but at the sight antonio he started
up and half drew his sword while inez disengaged
fled back to the house
all the jealous doubts and fears antonio
were now confirmed he did not remain to encounter
the resentment his happy rival at
being thus interrupted but turned from the place
with sudden wretchedness heart that inez
should love another would have been misery
enough but that she should be capable a
dishonourable amour shocked him in the extreme
the idea deception in so young and
apparently artless a being brought with it that
sudden distrust in human nature so sickening to
a youthful and ingenuous mind but when he
thought the kind simple parent she was deceiving
whose affections all centered in her he
felt for a moment a sentiment indignation
and almost aversion
the student salamanca 
he found the alchymist still seated in visionary
contemplation the moon come hither
m on said he with his usual enthusiasm
come read with me this vast volume wisdom
thus nightly unfolded before us wisely
did the chaldean sages affirm that the heaven
is as a mystic page uttering speech to those
who can rightly understand warning them 
good and evil and instructing them in the
secret decrees late
the student's heart ached for his venerable
master and for a time he felt the futility all
his occult wisdom alas poor old man
thought he little dost thou dream while busied
in airy speculations among the stars what a
treason against thy happiness is going on under
thine eye as it were in thy very bosom oh
inez inez where shall we look for truth and
innocence where shall we repose in confidence
in woman if even you can deceive 
it was a trite apostrophe such as every lover
makes when he finds his mistress not quite
such a goddess as he had painted her with
 the student salamanca
the student however it sprang from honest
anguish heart he returned to his lodgings
in pitiable confusion mind he now deplored
the infatuation that had led him on until
his feelings were so thoroughly engaged he
resolved to abandon his pursuits at the tower
and trust to absence to dispel the fascination by
which he had been spell bound he no longer
thirsted after the discovery the grand elixir 
the dream alchymy was over for without
inez what was the value the philosopher's
stone 
he rose after a sleepless night with the determination
 taking his leave the alchymist
and tearing himself from granada for
several days did he rise with the same resolution
and every night saw him come back
to his pillow to repine at his want resolution
and to make fresh determinations for the
morrow in the meanwhile he saw less inez
than ever she no longer walked in the garden
but remained almost entirely in her apartment
when she met him she blushed more
the student salamanca 
than usual and once hesitated as if she would
have spoken but after a temporary embarrassment
and still deeper blushes she made some
casual observation and retired antonio read
in this confusion a consciousness fault and
 that fault's being discovered what could
she have wished to communicate perhaps to
account for the scene in the garden but how
can she account for it or why should she account
for it to me what am i to her or
rather what is she to me exclaimed he impatiently
with a new resolution to break through
these entanglements the heart and fly from
this enchanted spot for ever
he was returning that very night to his lodgings
full these excellent determinations
when in a shadowy part the road he
passed a person whom he recognized by his
height and form for his rival he was going
in the direction the tower if any lingering
doubts remained here was an opportunity 
settling them completely he determined to
follow this unknown cavalier and under favol
i 
 the student salamanca
your the darkness observe his movements
if he obtained access to the tower or in anyway
a favourable reception antonio felt as if it
would be a relief to his mind and would enable
him to fix his waveringesolution
the unknown as he came near the tower
was more cautious and stealthy in his approaches
he was joined under a clump trees by
another person and they had much whispering
together a light was burning in the chamber
 inez the curtain was drawn but the casement
was left open as the night was warm after
some time the light was extinguished a considerable
interval elapsed the cavalier and his
companion remained under covert the trees
as if keeping watch at length they approached
the tower with silent and cautious steps the
cavalier received a dark lanthorn from his companion
and threw off his cloak the other then
softly brought something from the clump trees
which antonio perceived to be a light ladder
he placed it against the wall and the serenade
gently ascended a sickening sensation came
over antonio here was indeed a confirmathe
student salamanca 
tion every fear he was about to leave the
place never to return when he heard a stifled
shriek from inez chamber
in an instant the fellow that stood at the foot
 the ladder lay prostrate on the ground antonio
wrested a stiletto from his nerveless hand
and hurried up the ladder he sprang in at the
window and found inez struggling in the grasp
 his fancied rival the latter disturbed from
his prey caught up his lanthorn turned its light
full upon antonio and drawing his sword made
a furious assault luckily the student saw the
light gleam along the blade and parried the
thrust with the stiletto a fierce but unequal
combat ensued antonio fought exposed to the
full glare the light while his antagonist was
in shadow his stiletto too was but a poor defence
against a rapier he saw that nothing
w r ould save him but closing with his adversary
and getting within his weapon he rushed furiously
upon him and gave him a severe blow with
the stiletto but received a wound in return from
the shortened sword at the same moment a
 the student salamanca
blow was inflicted from behind by the confederate
who had ascended the ladder it felled
him to the floor and his antagonists made their
escape
by this time the cries inez had brought
her father and the domestic to the room antonio
was found weltering in his blood and
senseless he was conveyed to the chamber
 the alchymist who now repaid in kind
the attentions which the student had once bestowed
upon him among his varied knowledge
he possessed some skill in surgery which at
this moment was more value than even his
chronical lore he stanched and dressed the
wounds his disciple which on examination
proved less desperate than he had at first apprehended

for a few days however his case was anxious
and attended with danger the old man
watched over him with the affection a parent
he felt a double debt gratitude towards
him on account his daughter and himself
he loved him too as a faithful and zealous
the student salamanca 
disciple and he dreaded lest the world should
be deprived the promising talents so aspiring
an alchymist
an excellent constitution soon medicine his
wounds and there was a balsam in the looks
and words inez that had a healing effect on
still severer wounds which he carried in his
heart she displayed the strongest interest in
his safety she called him her deliverer her
preserver it seemed as if her grateful disposition
sought in the warmth its acknowledgments
to repay him for past coldness
but what most contributed to antonio's recovery
was her explanation concerning his supposed
rival it was some time since he had
first beheld her at church and he had ever since
persecuted her with his attentions
he had beset her in her walks until she had
been obliged to confine herself to the house except
when accompanied by her father he had
besieged her with letters serenades and every
art by which he could urge a vehement but
clandestine and dishonourable suit the scene
 the student salamanca
in the garden was as much a surprise to her as
to antonio her persecutor had been attracted
by her voice and had found his way over a
ruined part the wall he had come upon her
unawares was detaining her by force and pleading
his insulting passion when the appearance
 the student interrupted him and enabled her
to make her escape she had forborne to mention
to her father the persecution which she
suffered she wished to spare him unavailing
anxiety and distress and had determined to confine
herself more rigorously to the house though
it appeared that even here she had not been
safe from his daring enterprize
antonio inquired whether she knew the name
 this impetuous admirer she replied that he
had made his advances under a fictitious name
but that she had heard him once called by the
name don ambrosio de loxia
antonio knew him by report for one the
most determined and dangerous libertines in all
granada artful accomplished and if he chose
to be so insinuating but daring and headlong
the student salamanca 
in the pursuit his pleasures violent and implacable
in his resentments he rejoiced to find
that inez had been proof against his seductions
and had been inspired with loathing by his splendid
profligacy but he trembled to think the
dangers she had run and he felt solicitude about
the dangers that must yet environ her
at present however it was probable the enemy
had a temporary quietus the traces blood
had been found for some distance from the ladder
until they were lost among thickets and as
nothing had been heard or seen him since
it was concluded thathe had been seriously
wounded
as the student recovered from his wounds he
was enabled to join inez and her father in their
domestic intercourse the chamber in which
they usually met had probably been a saloon 
state in former times the floor was marble
 the walls partially covered with the remains
 tapestry the chairs richly carved and covered
with tarnished and tattered brocade against
the wall hung a long rusty rapier the only re
 the student salamanca
pique that the old man retained the chivalry 
his ancestors there might have been something
to provoke a smile in the contrast between the
mansion and its inhabitants between present
poverty and the traces departed grandeur 
but the fancy the student had thrown so
much romance about the edifice and its inmates
that every thing was clothed with charms the
philosopher with his broken down pride and his
strange pursuits seemed to comport with the
melancholy ruin he inhabited and there was a
native elegance spirit about the daughter that
showed she would have graced the mansion in
its happier days
what delicious moments were these to the
student inez was no longer coy and reserved
she was naturally artless and confiding though
the kind persecution she had experienced
from one admirer had rendered her for a time
suspicious and circumspect she now felt an
entire confidence in the sincerity and w r orth 
antonio mingled with an overflowing gratitude
when her eyes met his they beamed with symthe
student salamanca 
path and kindness and antonio no longer
haunted by the idea a favoured rival once
more aspired to success
at these domestic meetings however he had
little opportunity paying his court except by
looks the alchymist supposing him like himself
absorbed in the study alchymy endeavoured
to cheer the tediousness his recovery
by long conversations on the art he even
brought several his half burnt volumes that
the student had once rescued from the flames
and entertained him by the hour by reading copious
chapters the old man delighted in the
mystic phrases and symbolical jargon in which
the writers that have treated alchymy have
wrapped their communications rendering them
unintelligible except to the initiated with
what rapture would he elevate his voice at a
triumphant passage announcing the grand discovery
 thou shall see would he exclaim in
the words henry kuhnrade the stone the
philosophers our king go forth thebedcham
amphitheatre the eternal wisdom
vol i 
 the student salamanca
ber his glassy sepulchre into the theatre this
world that is to say regenerated and made perfect
a shining carbuncle a most temperate splendour
whose most subtle and depurated parts
re inseparable united into one with a concordia
mixture exceeding equal transparent as
chrystal shining red like a ruby permanently
colouring or ringing fixt in all temptations or
tryals yea in the examination the burning
sulphur itself and the devouring waters and in
the most vehement persecution the fire always
incombustible and permanent as a salamander

the student had a high veneration for the
fathers alchymy and a profound respect for
his instructor but what was henry kuhnrade
geber lully or even albertus magnus himself
compared to the countenance inez
which presented such a page beauty to his
perusal while therefore the good alchymist
was doling out knowledge by the hour his disciple
would forget books alchymy every thing
but the lovely object before him
the student salamanca 
inez too unpractised in the science the
heart was gradually becoming fascinated by
the silent attentions her lover day by day
she seemed more and more perplexed by the
kindling and strangely pleasing emotions her
bosom her eye was often cast down in
thought blushes stole to her cheek without
any apparent cause and light half suppressed
sighs would follow these short fits musing
her little ballads though the same that she had
always sung yet breathed a more tender spirit
either the tones her voice were most soft and
touching or some passages were delivered with
a feeling which she had never before given them
antonio beside his love for the abstruse sciences
had a pretty turn for music and never did philosopher
touch the guitar more tastefully as
by degrees he conquered the mutual embarrassment
that kept them asunder he ventured to
accompany her in some her songs he had
a voice full fire and tenderness as he sang
one would have thought from the kindling
blushes his companion that he had been
 the student salamanca
pleading his own passion in her ear let those
who would keep two youthful hearts asunder
beware music oh this leaning over chairs
and conning the same music and entwining
 voices and melting away in harmonies 
the german waltz is nothing to it the worthy
alchymist saw nothing all this his mind
could admit no idea that was not connected
with the discovery the grand arcanum and
he supposed his youthful coadjutor equally devoted
he was a mere child as to human nature
 and as to the passion love whatever
he might once have felt it he had long since
forgotten that there was such an idle passion
in existence but while he dreamed the silent
amour went on the very quiet and seclusion
 the place was favourable to the growth 
romantic passion the opening bud love
was able to put forth leaf by leaf without an
adverse wind to check its growth there was
neither officious friendship to chill by its advice
nor insidious envy to wither by its sneers nor
an observing world to look on and stare it out
the student salamanca 
 countenance there was neither declaration
nor vow nor any other form cupid's canting
school their hearts mingled together and understood
each other without the aid language
they lapsed into the full current affection
unconscious its depth and thoughtless the
rocks that might lurk beneath its surface happy
lovers who wanted nothing to make their
felicity complete but the discovery the philosopher's
stone 
at length antonio's health was sufficiently restored
to enable him to return to his lodgings in
granada he felt uneasy however at leaving
the tower while lurking danger might surround
its almost defenceless inmates he dreaded lest
don ambrosio recovered from his wounds
might plot some new attempt by secret art or
open violence from all that he had heard he
knew him to be too implacable to suffer his defeat
to pass unrevenged and too rash and fearless
when his arts were unavailing to stop at
any daring deed in the accomplishment his
purposes he urged his apprehensions to the
 the student salamanca
alchymist and his daughter and proposed that
they should abandon the dangerous vicinity

went on to paint the beauties and delights va

paints the fields and groves which he is picturing
as the future scenes his happiness his eloquence
backed by the apprehensions inez
was successful with the alchymist who indeed 
had led too unsettled a life to be particular about
the place his residence and it was determined
that as soon as antonio's health was perfectly
restored they should abandon the tower and
seek the neighbourhood valencia
to recruit his strength the student suspended
his toils in the laboratory and spent the few remaining
days before departure in taking a farewell
look at the enchanting environs granada
he felt returning health and vigour as he in
the student salamanca 
haled the pure temperate breezes that play
about its hills and the happy state his mind
contributed to his rapid recovery inez was often
the companion his walks her descent by the
mother's side from one the ancient moorish
families gave her an interest in this once favourite
seat arabian power she gazed
with enthusiasm upon its magnificent monuments
and her memory was filled with the traditional
tales and ballads moorish chivalry
indeed the solitary life she had led and the
visionary turn her father's mind had produced
an effect upon her character and given it a tinge
 what in modern days would be called romance
all this was called into full force by
this new passion for when a woman first begins
to love life is all romance to her
in one their evening strolls they had ascended
to the mountain the sun where is
situated the generalise the palace pleasure
in the days moorish dominion but now
a gloomy convent capuchins they had
wandered about its garden among groves 
 the student salamanca
orange citron and cypresses where the waters
leaping in torrents or gushing in fountains
or tossed aloft in sparkling jets fill the
air with music and freshness still there is a
melancholy mingled with all the beauties this
garden that gradually stole over the feelings
 the lovers the place is full the sad
story past times it was the favourite abode
 the lovely queen granada where she
was surrounded by the delights a gay and
voluptuous court it was here too amidst her
own bowers roses that her slanderers laid
the base story her dishonour and struck a
fatal blow to the line the gallant abencer
rages
the whole garden has a look ruin and neglect
many the fountains are dry and
broken the streams have wandered from their
marble channels and are choked by weeds and
yellow leaves the reed whistles to the wind
where it had once sported among roses and
shaken perfume from the orange blossom the
convent bell flings its sullen sound or the drown

sy vesper hymn floats along these solitudes
which once resounded with the song and the
dance and the lover's serenade well may
the moors lament over the loss this earthly
paradise well may they remember it in their
prayers and beseech heaven to restore it to the
faithful well may their ambassadors smite their
breasts when they wander among these monuments
 their race and sit down and weep
among the fading glories granada 
it is impossible to wander among these scenes
 departed love and gayety and not feel the
tenderness the heart awakened it was then
that antonio first ventured to breathe his passion
arid to express by words what his eyes had
long since so eloquently revealed he made
his avowal with fervour but with frankness
he had no gay prospects to hold out he was a
poor scholar dependent on his good spirits to
feed and clothe him but a woman in love is
no interested calculator inez listened to him
with downcast eyes but in them was a humid
gleam that showed her heart was with him
vol j 
 the student salamanca
she had no prudery in her nature and she had
not been sufficiently in society to acquire it
she loved him with all the absence worldliness
 a genuine woman and amidst timid
smiles and blushes he drew from her a modest
acknowledgment her affection they wandered
about the garden with sweet intoxication
 the soul which none but happy lovers know
the world about them was all fairy land and
indeed it spread forth one its fairest scenes
before their eyes as if to fulfil their dream 
earthly happiness they looked out from between
groves orange upon the towers granada
below them the magnificent plain the
vega beyond streaked with evening sunshine
and the distant hills tinted with rosy and purple
hues it seemed an emblem the happy future
that love and hope was decking out for them
as if to make the scene complete a group 
andalusians struck up a dance in one the
vistas the garden to the notes the guitars
 two wandering musicians the spanish
music is wild and plaintive yet the people dance
the student salamanca 
to it with enthusiasm the picturesque figures
 the dancers the girls with their hair in silken
nets that hung in knots and tassels down their
backs their mantillas floating round their airy
figures their slender feet and ankles peeping
from under their basquines their arms thrown
up in the air to play the castanets had a beautiful
effect on this airy height with the rich
evening landscape spreading out below them
in a little while the dance ceased two the
parties approached antonio and inez and began
a soft and tender moorish ballad accompanied
by the lute it alluded to the story the garden
 the wrongs the fair queen granada
and the misfortunes the abencerrages it
was one those old ballads that abound in
andalusia and seem to e like echoes about
the ruins moorish greatness the tears rose
into the eyes inez as she listened to the tale 
her heart was open to every tender impression
the singer approached her and suddenly
varying her manner sang impending danger
and treachery the manner the look the gest
the student salamanca
circulation the singer was such as to make it
pointed arid startling she was about to ask
the meaning this evidently personal application
 the song when she was interrupted by
antonio who gently drew her from the place
while she had been lost in attention to the music
he had remarked a group men in the
shadow the trees whispering together they
were enveloped in the broad hats and great
cloaks so much worn by the spanish and while
they were regarding himself and inez attentively
seemed anxious to avoid observation
not knowing what might be their character or
intention he hastened to quit a place where the
gathering shadows evening might expose
them to intrusion and insult on their way
down the hill as they passed through the woods
 elms mingled with poplars and oleanders
that skirt the road leading from the alhambra
he again saw these men apparently following
at a distance and he afterwards caught sight 
them among the trees on the banks the varro
he said nothing on the subject to inez nor
the student salamanca 
her father for he would not awaken unnecessary
alarm but he felt at a loss how to ascertain
or to avert any machinations that might
be devising again the helpless inhabitants the
tower
he took his leave them at night full this
perplexity as he left the dreary old pile he
saw some one lurking in the shadow the wall
apparently watching his movements he hastened
after the figure but it glided away and
disappeared among some ruins shortly after he
heard a low whistle which was answered from a
little distance he had no longer a doubt but
that some mischief was on foot and turned to
hasten back to the tower and put its inmates on
their guard he had scarcely turned however
before he found himself suddenly seized from
behind by some one herculean strength his
struggles were in vain he was surrounded byarmed
men one threw a mantle over him that
stifled his cries and enveloped him in its folds
and he was hurried off with irresistible rapidity
the next day passed without the appearance
 the student salamanca
 antonio at the alchymist's another and
another day succeeded and yet he did not come
nor had any thing been heard him at his lodgings
his absence caused at first surprise and
conjecture and at length alarm inez recollected
the singular intimations the ballad
singer upon the mountain which seemed to warn
her impending danger and her mind was full
 vague forebodings she sat listening to every
sound at the gate or tread on the stairs she
would take up her guitar and strike a few notes
but it would not do her heart was sickening with
suspense and anxiety she had never before
felt what it was to be really lonely she now
was conscious the force that attachment
which had taken possession her breast for
never do we know how much we love never do
we know how necessary the object our love
is to our happiness until we experience the
weary void separation
the philosopher too felt the absence his
disciple almost as sensibly as did his daughter
the animating buoyancy the youth had in
the student salamanca 
spired him with new ardour and had given to
his labours the charm full companionship
however he had resources and consolations 
which his daughter was destitute his pursuits
were a nature to occupy every thought and
keep the spirits in a state continual excitement
certain indications too had lately manifested
themselves the most favourable nature
forty days and forty nights had the process gone
on successfully the old man's hopes were constantly
rising and he now considered the glorious
moment once more at hand when he should
obtain not merely the major lunaria but likewise
the tincture salaries the means multiplying
gold and prolonging existence he
remained therefore continually shut up in his
laboratory watching his furnace for a moment's
inadvertency might once more defeat all his expectations

he was sitting one evening at one his solitary
vigils wrapped up in meditation the hour
was late and his neighbour the owl was hooting
from the battlements the tower when he
 the student salamanca
heard the door open behind him supposing
it to be his daughter coming to take her leave 
him for the night as was her frequent practice
he called her by name but a harsh voice met his
ear in reply he was grasped by the arms and
looking up perceived three strange men in the
chamber he attempted to shake them off butin
vain he called for help but they scoffed
at his cries
peace dotard cried one think'st thou
the servants the most holy inquisition are to
be daunted by thy clamours comrades away
with him 
without heeding his remonstrances and entreaties
they seized upon his books and papers
took some note the apartment and the utensils
and then bore him off a prisoner
inez left to herself had passed a sad and
lonely evening by a casement which looked into
a garden she had pensively watched star after
star sparkle out the blue depths the sky
and was indulging a crowd anxious thoughts
about her lover until the rising tears began to
the student salamanca 
flow she was suddenly alarmed by the sound
 voices that seemed to come from a distant
part the mansion there was not long after
a noise several persons descending the stairs 
surprised at these unusual sounds in their lonely
habitation she remained for a few moments in a
state trembling yet indistinct apprehension 
when the servant rushed into the room with terror
in her countenance and informed her that
her father was carried off by armed men inez
did not stop to hear farther but flew down stairs
to overtake them she had scarcely passed the
threshold when she found herself in the grasp 
strangers
away away cried she wildly do not
stop me let me follow my father
we are come to conduct you to him senora
said one the men respectfully
where is he then 
he is gone to granada replied the man
an unexpected circumstance requires his presence
there immediately but he is among
friends
vol i 
 the student salamanca
we have no friends in granada said inez
drawing back but then the idea antonio
rushed to her mind something relating to him
might have called her father thither is senor
antonio de castro with him demanded she
with agitation
i know not senora replied the man it is
very possible i only know that he is among
friends and is anxious for you to follow him
let us go then cried she eagerly the men
led her a little distance to where a mule was
waiting and assisting her to mount they conducted
her slowly towards the city
granada was on that evening a scene fanciful
revel it was one the festivals the
maestranza an association the nobility to
keep up some the gallant customs ancient
chivalry there had been a representation 
a tournament in one the squares the streets
would still occasionally resound with the beat
 a solitary drum or the bray a trumpet
from some straggling party revellers sometimes
they were met by cavaliers richly dressed
in ancient costumes attended by their squires
the student salamanca 
and at one time they passed in sight a
palace brilliantly illuminated from whence
came the mingled sounds music and the
dance shortly after they came to the square
where the mock tournament had been held it
was thronged by the populace recreating themselves
among booths and stalls where refreshments
were sold and the glare torches
showed the temporary galleries and gay coloured
awnings and armorial trophies and other
paraphernalia the show the conductors 
inez endeavoured to keep out observation and
to traverse a gloomy part the square but they
were detained at one place by the pressure a
crowd surrounding a party wandering musicians
singing one those ballads which the
spanish populace are so passionately fond the
torches which were held by some the crowd
threw a strong mass light upon inez and the
sight so beautiful a being without mantilla
or veil looking so bewildered and conducted
by men who seemed to take no gratification in
the surrounding gayety occasioned expressions
 the student salamanca
 curiosity one the ballad singers approached
and striking her guitar with peculiar
earnestness began to sing a doleful air full 
sinister forebodings inez started with surprise
it was the same ballad singer that had addressed
her in the gardens generalise she was
young and beautiful with an air wildness and
melancholy
it was the same air that she had then sung
it spoke impending dangers they seemed
indeed to be thickening around her she was
anxious to speak with this girl and to ascertain
whether indeed she had a knowledge any definite
evil that was threatening her but as she
attempted to address her the mule on which she
rode was suddenly seized and led forcibly through
the throng by one her conductors while she
saw another addressing menacing words to the
ballad singer the latter raised her hand with
a warning gesture as inez lost sight her
while inez was yet lost in perplexity caused
by this singular occurrence they stopped at the
gate a large mansion one her attendants
the student salamanca 
knocked the door was opened and they entered
a paved court where are we demanded
inez with anxiety at the house a friend
senora replied the man ascend this staircase
with me and in a moment you will meet
your father they ascended the staircase that
led to a suite splendid apartments they
passed through several until they came to an
inner chamber the door opened some one
approached but what was her terror at perceiving
not her father but don ambrosio the
men who had seized upon the alchymist had at
least been more honest in their professions they
were indeed familiars the inquisition he
was conducted in silence to the gloomy prison 
that terrible tribunal it was a mansion whose
every aspect withered joy and almost shut out
hope it was one those hideous abodes which
the bad passions men conjure up in this fair
world to rival the fancied dens demons and
the accursed
day after day went heavily by without anything
to mark the lapse time but the decline
 the student salamanca
and reappearance the light that feebly glimmered
through the narrow window the dungeon
in which the unfortunate alchymist was
buried rather than confined his mind was harassed
with uncertainties and fears about his
daughter so helpless and inexperienced he
endeavoured to gather tidings her from the
man who brought his daily portion food the
fellow stared as if astonished at being asked a
question in that mansion silence arid mystery 
but departed without saying a word every
succeeding attempt was equally fruitless
the poor alchymist was oppressed by many
griefs and it was not the least that he had been
again interrupted in his labours on the very point
 success never was alchymist so near attaining
the golden secret a little longer and all his
hopes would have been realized the thoughts
 these disappointments afflicted him more even
than the fear all that he might suffer from the
merciless inquisition his waking thoughts
would follow him into his dreams he would be
transported in fancy to his laboratory busied
the student salamanca 
again among retorts and alembics and surrounded
by lully by d'abano by olibius and the other
masters the sublime art the moment 
projection would arrive a seraphic form would
arise out the furnace holding forth a vessel
containing the precious elixir but before he
could grasp the prize he would awake and find
himself in a dungeon
all the devices inquisitorial ingenuity were
employed to ensnare the old man and to draw
from him evidence that might be brought against
himself and might corroborate certain secret information
that had been given against him he
had been accused practising necromancy and
judicial astrology and a cloud evidence had
been secretly brought forward to substantiate
the charge it would be tedious to enumerate
all the circumstances apparently corroborative
which had been industriously cited by the secret
accuser the silence which prevailed about the
tower its desolateness the very quiet its inhabitants
had been adduced as proofs that something
sinister was perpetrated within
 the student salamanca
the alchymist's conversations and soliloquies
in the garden had been overheard and misrepresented
the lights and strange appearances at
night in the tower were given with violent exaggerations
shrieks and yells were said to have
been heard from thence at midnight when it
was confidently asserted the old man raised
familiar spirits by his incantations and even
compelled the dead to rise from their graves and
answer to his questionings
the alchymist according to the custom the
inquisition was kept in complete ignorance 
his accuser the witnesses produced against
him even the crimes which he was accused
he was examined generally whether he knew
why he was arrested and was conscious any
guilt that might deserve the notice the holy
office he was examined as to his country 
his life his habits his pursuits his actions and
opinions
the old man was frank and simple in his replies
 he was conscious no guilt capable no
art practised in no dissimulation after receiving
the student salamanca 
a general admonition to bethink himself whether
he had not committed any act deserving punishment
and to prepare by confession to secure the
wellknown mercy the tribunal he was remanded
to his cell
he was now visited in his dungeon by crafty
familiars the inquisition who under pretence
 sympathy and kindness came to beguile the
tediousness his imprisonment with friendly
conversation they casually introduced the
subject alchymy on which they touched with
great caution and pretended indifference there
was no need such craftiness the honest enthusiast
had no suspicion in his nature the moment
they touched upon his favourite theme he
forgot his misfortunes and imprisonment and
broke forth into rhapsodies about the divine
science
the conversation was artfully turned to the
discussion elementary beings the alchymist
readily avowed his belief in them and
that there had been instances their attending
upon philosophers and administering to their
vol i 
 the student salamanca
wishes he related many miracles said to
have been performed by apologies thanes
through the aid spirits or demons insomuch
that he was set up by the heathens in opposition
to the messiah and was even regarded with
reverence by many christians the familiars
eagerly demanded whether he believed apollo
ninus to be a true and worthy philosopher the
unaffected piety the alchymist protected him
even in the midst his simplicity for he condemned
apologies as a sorcerer and an impostor
no art could ever draw from him an admission
that he had ever employed or invoked
spiritual agencies in the prosecution his pursuits
though he believed himself to have been
frequently impeded by them
the inquisitors were baffled and disappointed
in not being able to inveigle him into a confession
 a criminal nature they attributed it to
craft to obstinacy to every cause but the right
one namely that the harmless visionary had
nothing guilty to confess
they had abundant proof a secret nature
the student salamanca 
against him but it was the practice the inquisition
to endeavour to procure confession
from the prisoners
an autodafe was at hand the worthy fathers
were eager for his conviction for they were always
anxious to have a good number culprits
condemned to the stake to grace their
solemn triumphs he was at length brought
to a final examination
the chamber trial was spacious and
gloomy at one was a huge crucifix the
standard the inquisition a long table extended
through the centre the room at which
sat the inquisitors and their secretary at the
other a stool was placed for the prisoner
he was brought in according to custom bareheaded
and bare legged he was enfeebled by
confinement and affliction by constantly brooding
over the unknown fate his child and the
disastrous interruption his experiments he
sat bowed down and listless his head sunk
upon his breast his whole appearance that 
one past hope abandoned and by himself
given over
 the student salamanca
the accusation alleged again him was now
brought forward in a specific form he was
called upon by name felix de vasquez formerly
 castile to answer to the charges 
necromancy and demonology he was told that
the charges were amply substantiated and
was asked whether he was ready by ample confession
to throw himself upon the wellknown
mercy the holy inquisition
the philosopher testified some slight surprise
at the accusation but simply replied am
innocent
what proof have you to give your innocence
 it rather remains for you to prove
your charges cried the old man i am a
stranger and a sojourner in the land and know
no one out the doors my dwelling i can
give nothing in my vindication but the word 
a nobleman and a castilian
the inquisitor shook his head and went onto
repeat the various inquiries that had before
been made as to his mode life and pursuit
the poor alchymist was too feeble and weary
at heart to make any but brief replies he re
the student salamanca 
quested that some man science might examine
his laboratory and all his books and papers 
by which it would be made abundantly evident
that he w r as merely engaged in the study alchymy

to this the inquisitor observed that alchymy
had become a mere covert for secret and deadly
sins that the practises it were known to
scruple at no means to satisfy their inordinate
greediness gold some had been known to
use spells and impious ceremonies to conjure
the aid evil spirits nay even to sell their souls
to the enemy mankind so that they might
riot in boundless wealth while living
o
the poor alchymist had heard all patiently or
at least passively he had disdained to vindicate
his name otherwise than by his word he
had smiled at the accusations sorcery when
applied merely to himself but when the sublime
art which had been the study and passion his
life was assailed he could no longer listen in
silence his head gradually rose from his bosom
a hectic colour came in faint streaks to his
 the student salamanca
cheeks played about there disappeared returned
 and at length kindled into a burning glow
the clammy dampness dried from his forehead 
his eyes which had been nearly extinguished
lightedup again and burned with their wonted
and visionary fires
he entered into a vindication his favourite
art his voice at first was feeble and broken
but it gathered strength as he proceeded until
it rolled in a deep and sonorous volume he
gradually rose from his seat as he rose with his
subject he threw back the scanty black mantle
which had hitherto wrapped his limbs the very
uncouthness his form and looks gave an impressive
effect to what he uttered it was as
though a corpse had become suddenly animated
he repelled with scorn the aspersions cast upon
alchymy by the ignorant and vulgar he assumed
it to be the mother all art and science citing
the opinions paracelsus sandivogius
raymond lully and others in support his
assertions he maintained that it was pure and
innocent and honourable both in its purposes
the student salamanca 
and means what were its objects the perpetuation
 life and youth and the production 
gold the elixir vitae said he is no
charmed potion but merely a concentration 
those elements vitality which nature has scattered
through her works the philosopher's
stone or tincture or powder as it is variously
called is no necromantic talisman but consists
simply those particles which gold contains
within itself for its reproduction for gold like
other things has its seed within itself though
bound up with inconceivable firmness from the
vigour innate fixed salts and sulphur
in seeking to discover the elixir life then
continued he we seek only to apply some 
nature's own specifics against the disease and
decay to which our bodies are subjected and
what else does the physician when he tasks his
art and uses subtle compounds and cunning distillations
to revive our languishing powers and
avert the stroke death for a season 
 in seeking to multiply the precious metals
also we seek but to germinate and multiply by

employed the latest hour their life

gaze what a glorious reverse will there be in
his condition how will he emerge from his
solitary retreat like the sun breaking forth from

here he was interrupted by the inquisitor
who had suffered him to go on thus far in hopes 
gathering something from his unguarded enthu
the student salamanca
siam senor said he this is all rambling
visionary talk you are charged with sorcery
and in defence you give us a rhapsody about alchymy
have you nothing better than this to
offer in your defence 
the old man slowly resumed his seat but did
not deign a reply the fire that had beamed
in his eye gradually expired his cheek resumed
its wonted paleness but he did not relapse
into inanity he sat with a serene steady patient
look like one prepared not to contend but
to suffer
his trial continued for a long time with cruel
mockery justice for no witnesses were ever in
this court confronted with the accused and the
latter had continually to defend himself in the
dark some unknown and powerful enemy
had alleged charges against the unfortunate alchymist
but who he could not imagine stranger
and sojourner as he was in the land solitary
and harmless in his pursuits how could he have
provoked such hostility the tide secret testimony
however was too strong against him he
the student salamanca 
was convicted the crime magic and condemned
to expiate his sins at the stake at the
approaching autodafe
while the alchymist was undergoing his trial
at the inquisition his unhappy daughter was
exposed to trials no less severe don ambrosio
into whose hands she had fallen was as has
before been intimated one the most daring and
lawless profligates in all granada he was a
man hot blood and headlong passions that
stopped at nothing in pursuit his desires yet
with all these he possessed manners address and
accomplishments that had made him eminently
successful with the sex he was sated however
with easy conquests and wearied with a life 
continual and prompt gratification there had
been a degree difficulty and enterprize in the
pursuit inez that he had never before experienced
it had aroused him from the monotony
 mere sensual life and stimulated him
with all the charm adventure now that he
had her in his power he was determined to protract
the pleasure pursuit he was vain 
 the student salamanca
his person and address and it was a kind trial
 skill to endeavour to gain by art and ingenuity
what he could at any time obtain by violence
he affected to treat her with respect and
kindness he endeavoured to soothe her alarms
concerning her father by assurances his safety
and that she should soon be restored to him
every means was lavished to calm and soften
her and if possible to dispose her mind to favourable
impressions the house resounded
with soft music the apartments breathed perfumes
 all about her enticed to pleasure and voluptuousness
 but the heart inez turned with
distaste from the cruel mockery and if eves
don ambrosio deceived by the mute dejection
into which she would sometimes sink would attempt
to plead his passion she recoiled from
him with loathing and detestation
the vanity don ambrosio was at length
incensed at this inflexible scorn from one whom
he considered so far beneath him and who
ought to have felt honoured by his admiration
still he was determined that his triumph should
the student salamanca 
be by artifice and that she should be in a manner
accessary to her own dishonour since all
his arts seduction were no avail he endeavoured
to conquer her through her fears
he now informed her her father's confinement
in the prison the inquisition that his
case was desperate that it depended upon the
evidence don ambrosio and others who were
at his beck either to save or destroy him but
i am wrong added he it is with you beautiful
inez to say the word life or death
one kind word and you will behold me at your
feet your father at liberty and in affluence and
we shall all be happy
inez listened to him with scorn and disbelief
she looked upon it as another his deceptions
my father exclaimed she is too inoffensive
to attract persecution he is too innocent and
good to be suspected crime tis a base a
cruel artifice don ambrosio repeated what he
had said with solemn protestations its truth
but she turned from him with indignation and
he felt awed and surprised at the pride and
 the student salamanca
loftiness her demeanour he had now gone
too far to retrace his steps and resume the affectation
 kindness a few days after he brought
her the proclamation the approaching 
in which the prisoners were enumerated
she glanced her eye over it and saw her father's
name condemned to the stake for sorcery
for a moment her brain reeled she stood transfixed
with horror the artful ambrosio seized
upon the transient calm think now beautiful
inez said he with a tone affected tenderness
 his life is yet in your hands one word
from you and i can save him
monster wretch murderer exclaimed
she recoiling with shuddering abhorrence
then clasping her hands with frantic violence
oh my father my father cried she in a
tone frantic agony
the perfidious ambrosio saw the torture 
her soul and anticipated from it a triumph he
saw she was in no mood during her present paroxysm
to listen to his words but he trusted
that a night agony would subdue her stubborn
resolution
the student salamanca 
tomorrow said he as he left the room
is to be the autodafe one night more have
you to reflect tomorrow you will hear the
very tumult the procession that carries your
father to his death you will almost hear the
groans from his funeral pile i leave you to
yourself think whether you can stand all this
without shrinking think whether you can
endure the reflection that you were the cause 
his death and that merely from a perversity in
refusing proffered happiness
what a night was it to inez her heart
already harassed and almost broken by repeated
and protracted anxieties and terrors her form
wasted and nearly exhausted on every side
horrors surrounded her there seemed to be no
escape from misery and perdition is there no
relief from man no pity in heaven exclaimed
she what what have we done that we should
be thus wretched all night long she paced
her chamber her mind in a whirl anguish and
dismay as the dawn approached she heard
the distant tread footsteps in the street and the
vol i 
 the student salamanca
confused murmur voices she fancied it the
early stir the populace always eager in spain
for this horrid ceremony at sunrise the great
bell the cathedral began to toll its awful notes
 funeral preparation every stroke seemed to
beat upon her heart and inflict an absolute corporeal
pang her blood grew hot in her veins 
her tongue was parched she panted and gasped
rather than breathed blessed virgin exclaimed
she clasping her hands and turning up

her strained eyes look down with pity and
support me in this hour agony 
all granada was in agitation on the morning
 this dismal day the heavy bell the cathedral
continued to utter its clanging tones that
pervaded every part the city summoning all
persons to the tremendous spectacle that was
about to be exhibited the streets through
which the procession was to pass were crowded
with the populace the windows the roofs
every place that would admit a face or a foothold
was alive with spectators in the great
square a spacious scaffolding like an amphitheatre
student salamanca 
tre was erected where the sentences the prisoners
were to be read and the sermon faith
to be preached and close by were the stakes
prepared where the condemned were to be
burnt to death seats were arranged for the
great the gay the beautiful for such is the
horrible curiosity human nature that this
cruel sacrifice was attended with more eagerness
than a theatre or even a ball feast
as the day advanced the scaffolds and balconies
were filled with expecting multitudes the
sun shone brightly upon fair faces and gallant
dresses one would have thought it some scene
 elegant festivity instead an exhibition 
human agony and death but what a different
spectacle and ceremony was this from those
which granada exhibited in the days her
moorish splendour her galas her tournaments
her sports the ring her fetes st
john her music her umbras and admirable
tilts with canes her serenades her concerts
her songs in generalise the costly liveries
 the abencerrages their exquisite inventions 
 the student salamanca
the skill and valour the alabeces the superb
dresses the series mazas and gomez 
all these were at an the days chivalry
were over instead the prancing cavalcade
with neighing steed and lively trumpet with
burnished lance and helm and buckler with
rich confusion plume and scarf and banner
where purple and scarlet and green and orange
and every gay colour were mingled with cloth
 gold and fair embroidery instead this
crept on the gloomy pageant superstition in
cowl and sackcloth with cross and coffin and
frightful symbols human suffering in place
 the frank hardy knight open and brave with
his lady s favour in his casque and amorous
motto on his shield looking by gallant deeds to
the smile beauty came the shaven unmanly
monk with downcast eyes and head and heart
bleached in the cold cloister secretly exulting
in this bigot triumph
the sound the bells gave notice that the
road's civil wars granada
the student salamanca 
dismal procession was advancing it passed
slowly through the principal streets the city
bearing in advance the awful banner the holy
office the prisoners walked singly attended
by confessors and guarded by familiars the
inquisition they were clad in different garments
according to the nature their punishments
 those who were to suffer death wore
the hideous samaria painted with flames and
demons the procession was swelled by choirs
 boys by different religious orders and public
dignitaries and above all by the fathers 
the faith moving with slow pace and profound
gravity truly triumphing as becomes the
principal generals that great victory
as the much dreaded banner the inquisition
advanced the countless throng sunk on
their knees before it they bowed their faces to
the very earth as it passed and then slowly rose
again like a great undulating billow a murmur
 tongues prevailed as the prisoners approached
 and eager eyes we're strained and
gonsalvius p 
 the student salamanca
fingers pointed to distinguish the different orders
 penitents whose habits denoted the degree
 punishment they were to undergo but
as those drew near whose frightful garb marked
them as destined to the flames the noise the
rabble subsided they seemed almost to hold in
their breaths filled with that strange and dismal
interest with which we contemplate a human
being on the verge suffering and death
it is an awful thing a voiceless noiseless
multitude the hushed and gazing stillness 
the surrounding thousands heaped on walls
and gates and roofs and hanging as it were in
clusters heightened the effect the pageant that
moved drearily on the low murmuring the
priests could now be heard in prayer and exhortation
with the faint responses the prisoners
and now and then the voices the choir at a
distance chanting the litanies the saints
the faces the prisoners were ghastly and
disconsolate even those who had been pardoned
and wore the sanbenito or penitential garment
bare traces the horrors they had underthe
student salamanca 
gone some were feeble and tottering from long
confinement some crippled and distorted by various
tortures every countenance was a dismal
page on which might be read the secrets their
prison house but in the looks those condemned
to death there was something fierce and
eager they seemed men harrowed up by
the past and desperate as to the future they
were anticipating with spirits fevered by despair
and fixed and clenched determination the
vehement struggle with agony and death which
they were shortly to undergo some cast now
and then a wild and anguished look about them
upon the shining day the sunlight palaces 
the gay the beautiful world which they w r ere
soon to quit for ever or a glance sudden indignation
at the thronging thousands happy in
liberty and life who seemed in contemplating
their frightful situation to exult in their own
comparative security
one among the condemned however was
an exception to these remarks he was an
aged man somewhat bowed down with a serene
 the student salamanca
though dejected countenance and a beaming
melancholy eye it was the alchymist the
populace looked upon him with a degree compassion
which they were not prone to feel towards
criminals condemned by the inquisition 
but when they were told he was convicted the
crime magic they drew back with awe and
abhorrence
the procession had reached the grand square
the first part had already mounted the scaffold
and the condemned were approaching the
press the populace became excessive and was
repelled as it were in billows by the guards
just as the condemned were entering the square
a shrieking was heard among the crowd a
female pale frantic dishevelled was seen struggling
through the multitude my father my
father was all the cry she uttered but it
thrilled through every heart the crowd instinctively
drew back and made way for her as she
advanced
the poor alchymist had made his peace with
heaven and by hard struggle had closed his
the student salamanca 
heart upon the world when the voice his
child called him once more back to worldly
thought and agony he turned towards the
wellknown voice his knees smote together he
endeavoured to stretch forth his pinioned arms
and felt himself clasped in the embraces his
child the emotions both were too agonizing
for utterance convulsive sobs and broken exclamations
and embraces more anguish than
tenderness were all that passed between them
the procession was interrupted for a moment
the astonished monks and familiars were filled
with involuntary respect at this agony natural
affection ejaculations pity broke from the
crowd touched by the filial piety the extraordinary
and hopeless anguish so young and
beautiful a being
every attempt to soothe her and prevail on
her to retire was unheeded at length they endeavoured
to separate her from her father by
force the movement roused her from her temporary
abandonment
with a sudden paroxysm fury she snatched
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a sword from one the familiars her late
pale countenance was flushed with rage and fire
flashed from her once soft and languishing eyes
the guards shrunk back with awe there
was something in this filial frenzy this feminine
tenderness wrought up to desperation that
touched even their hardened hearts they endeavoured
to pacify her but in vain her eye
was eager and quick as the she wolf's guarding
her young with one arm she pressed her father
to her bosom with the other she menaced everyone
that approached
the patience the guards was very soon exhausted
they had held back in awe but not
in fear with all her desperation the weapon
was soon wrested from her feeble hand and she
was borne shrieking and struggling among the
crowd the rabble murmured compassion but
such was the dread inspired by the inquisition
that no one attempted to interfere
the procession again resumed its march inez
was ineffectually struggling to release herself
from the hands the familiars that detained
the student salamanca 
her when suddenly she saw don ambrosio before
her wretched girl exclaimed he with
fury why have you fled from your friends 
deliver her said he to the familiars to my
domestics she is under my protection
his creatures advanced to seize her oh
no oh no cried she with new terrors and
clinging to the familiars i have fled from no
friends he is not my protector he is the
murderer my father 
the familiars were perplexed the crowd
pressed on with eager curiosity stand off
cried the fiery ambrosio dashing the throng
from around him then turning to the familiars
with sudden moderation my friends
said he deliver this poor girl to me her distress
has turned her brain she has escaped from
her friends and protectors this morning during
the confusion the house as the procession
went by a little quiet and kind treatment
will restore her to tranquillity
i am not mad i am not mad cried she
vehemently oh save me save me from
 the student salamanca
these men i have no protector on earth but my
father and him they are murdering 
the familiars shook their heads her wildness
corroborated the assertions don ambrosio
and his apparent rank commanded respect and
belief they relinquished their charge to him
and he was consigning the struggling inez to
his creatures let go your hold villain
cried a voice from among the crowd and antonio
was seen eagerly tearing his way through
the press people
seize him seize him cried don am
brosio to the familiars tis an accomplice 
the sorcerer
liar retorted antonio as he thrust the
mob to the right and left and forced himself to
the spot
the sword don ambrosio flashed in an
instant from the scabbard the student was
armed and equally alert there was a fierce
clash weapons the crowd made way for
them as they fought and closed again so as
to hide them from the view inez all was
the student salamanca 
tumult and confusion for a moment when there
was a kind shout from the spectators and
the mob again opening she beheld as she
thought antonio weltering in his blood
this new shock was too great for her already
overstrained intellects a giddiness seized
upon her every thing seemed to whirl before
her eyes she gasped some incoherent words
and sunk senseless upon the ground
days weeks elapsed before inez returned to
consciousness at length she opened her eyes
as if out a troubled sleep she was lying
upon a magnificent bed in a chamber richly
furnished with pier glasses and massive tables
inlaid with silver exquisite workmanship
the walls were covered with tapestry the cornices
richly gilded through the door which
stood open she perceived a superb saloon with
statues and chrystal lustres and a magnificent
suite apartments beyond the casements 
the room were open to admit the soft breath 
summer which stole in laden with perfumes
from a neighbouring garden from whence
the student salamanca
also the refreshing sounds fountains and the
sweet notes birds came in mingled music to
her ears female attendants were moving with
noiseless step about the apartment but as she
gazed around in silent wonder her eye rested
upon a new object interest in a chair at
the head her bed sat a venerable form
watching over her with a look fond anxiety
it was her father i will not attempt to describe
the scene that ensued nor the moments
 rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings
her affectionate heart had undergone as
soon as their feelings had become more calm
the alchymist stepped out the room to introduce
a stranger to whom they were indebted
for their lives and liberties he returned leading
in antonio no longer in his poor scholar's
garb but in the rich dress a nobleman
the feelings inez were nearly overpowered
by the sudden reverses and it was some time
before she was sufficiently calm to comprehend
the explanation this seeming romance
it appeared that the lover who had sought her
the student salamanca 
affections in the lowly guise a student was
only son and heir a powerful grandee valentia
some youthful irregularities had drawn
on him the displeasure his father he had
absented himself from home and remained incognito
at granada with a full resolve by study
and self regulation to reinstate himself in his
father's favour how hard he had studied
does not remain on record all that we know
is his romantic adventure the tower
it was at first a mere youthful caprice excited
by a glimpse a beautiful face in becoming a
disciple the achy mist he probably thought 
nothing more than pursuing a light love adventure
farther acquaintance however completely
fixed his affections in the mean time
he had been traced to his concealment his
father had relieved intelligence doubtless from
don ambrosio his being entangled in the
snares a mysterious adventurer and his daughter
trusty emissaries had been sent to seize
upon him and convey him by force to the paternal
home
 the student salamanca
what eloquence he used with his father to
convince him the perfect innocence and noble
descent the alchemist and the exalted worth
 his daughter does not appear all that we
know is that the father though a very passionate
was a very reasonable man as appears by
his consenting that his son should return to granada
and conduct inez as his affianced bride to
valentia on his arrival he had been shocked
at finding the tower deserted and reading the
alchymist's name on the list the condemned
at the autodafe he arrived just in time to
save him from the flames it was don ambrosia
that had fallen in their contest being
o
severely wounded and thinking his approaching
he had confessed to one the fathers
 the inquisition that he was the sole cause 
the alchymist's condemnation and that the evidence
on which it was founded was altogether
false the testimony don antonio came
in corroboration his innocence and as he was
a relation the grand inquisitor's it perhaps had
more than usual weight thus the poor alchy
the student salamanca 
mist was in a manner snatched from the very
flames and so great had been the sympathy excited
in his case that for once the populace
rejoiced in being disappointed an execution
the residue this story may readily be imagined
by any one versed in this valuable kind 
history don antonio married the lovely inez
and took her and her father with him to valencia
as she had been a loving and dutiful daughter
so she proved a true and tender wife it was
not long before he succeeded to his father's titles
and estates and he and his fair spouse were renowned
for being the handsomest and happiest
couple in all valentia
as to don ambrosio he partially recovered
to the enjoyment a broken constitution and a
blasted name and hid his remorse and disgraces
in a convent
the worthy alchymist took up his abode with
his children a pavilion in their garden was
assigned to him as a laboratory where he resumed
his researches after the grand secret he
was now and then assisted by his soninlaw
vol i 
 the student salamanca
but the latter slackened grievously in his zeal and
diligence after marriage still he would listen
with profound gravity and attention to the old
man's quotations from paracelsus sandivogius
and peter d'abano which daily grew longer
and longer in this way the good alchymist
lived on quietly and comfortably to what is called
a good old age that is to say an age that is
good for nothing and unfortunately for mankind
was hurried out life in his ninetieth
year just as he was on the point discovering
the philosopher's stone
such was the story the captain's friend 
which whiled away the whole morning very
tolerably the captain was every now and then
interrupted by questions and remarks which i
have not mentioned lest i should break the continuity
 the tale
he was also a little disturbed once or twice
by the general who fell asleep and breathed

the student salamanca 
rather hard to the great horror and annoyance
 lady lillycraft in a long and tender love
passage also which was particularly to her
ladyship's taste the unlucky general having his
head a little sunk upon his breast kept making
a sound at regular intervals very much like the
word pish long drawn out at length he made
an odd guttural sound that suddenly woke him 
he hemmed looked about with a slight degree
 consternation and then began to play with
her ladyship's work bag which however she
rather pettishly withdrew the steady sound
 the captain's voice however was too potent
a soporific for the poor general he kept gleaming
up and sinking in the socket until the cessation
 the tale again roused him when he
started awake put his foot down upon lady
lilly craft's cur the sleeping beauty which yelled
and seized him by the leg and in a moment
the whole library resounded with yelping and
exclamations never did a man more completely
mar his fortunes while he was asleep
silence was at length restored all the company
 the student op salamanca
expressed their thanks to the captain and gave
various opinions the story the parson said
he should have liked to have heard more the
leaden manuscript dug up at granada the general
said he could not well make out the drift
 the story he thought it a little confused i
am glad however said he that they burnt the
old chap the tower for i have no doubt he
was a notorious impostor

his certain life that never can deceive him
is full thousand sweets and rich content 
the smoothleav'd beeches in the field receive him
with coolest shade till noontide's heat be spent
his life is neither tost in boist'rous seas
or the vexatious world or lost in slothful ease
pleas'd and full blest he lives when he his god can please
phineas fletcher
i take great pleasure in accompanying the
squire in his perambulations about his estate
in which he is often attended by a kind cabinet
council his prime minister the steward is a
very worthy and honest old man and one those
veteran retainers that assume a right way 
that is to say a right to have his own way from
having lived time out mind on the place he
loves the estate even better than he does the 
 english country gentlemen
squire and thwarts the latter sadly in many 
his projects improvement and alteration indeed
the old man is a little apt to oppose every
plan that does not originate with himself and
will hold long arguments about it over a stile
or on a rise ground until the squire who hasa
high opinion his ability and integrity is fain
to give up the point such concession immediately
mollifies the old steward and it often happens
that after walking a field or two in silence
with his hands behind his back chewing the cud
 reflection he will suddenly observe that he
has been turning the matter over in his mind
and upon the whole he thinks he will take his
honour's advice
christy the huntsman is another the squire's
frequent attendants to whom he continually refers
in matters local history as to a chronicle
 the estate having been in a manner acquainted
with many the trees from the very
time that they were acorns old nimrod as i
have already shown is rather pragmatical on all
these points knowledge upon which he values
english country gentlemen 
himself but the squire never contradicts him 
and is certainly one the most indulgent potentates
that was ever henpecked by his ministers
he often laughs about it himself and evidently
yields to these old men in compliance
with the bent his own humour he likes this
honest independence old age for with all his
aristocratical feelings there is nothing that disgusts
him sooner than any appearance fawning
or servility
i really have seen no display royal state
that could compare with one the squire's
progresses about his paternal fields and through
his hereditary woodlands with several these
faithful adherents about him and followed by a
body guard dogs he encourages a frankness
and manliness deportment among his
dependants and is the personal friend his
tenants inquiring into their concerns and assisting
them in times difficulty and hardship
this has rendered him one the most popular
and course one the happiest landlords

 english country gentlemen
indeed i do not know a more enviable condition
 life than that an english gentleman
 sound judgment and good feelings who passes
the greater part his time on an hereditary estate
in the country from the excellence the
roads and the rapidity and exactness the public
conveyances he is enabled to command all
the comforts and conveniences all the intelligence
and novelties the capital while he is
removed from its hurry and distractions he
has ample means occupation and amusement
within his own domains he may diversify his
time by rural occupations by rural sports by
study and by the delights friendly society
collected within his own hospitable halls
or if his views and feelings are a more extensive
and liberal nature he has it greatly in his
power to do good and to have that good immediately
reflected back upon himself he can
render essential service to his country by assisting
in the disinterested administration the
laws by watching over the opinions and principles
 the lower orders around him by diff
country gentlemen 
fusing among them those lights which may be
important to their welfare by mingling frankly
among them gaining their confidence becoming
the immediate auditor their complaints
 informing himself their wants making
himself a channel through which their grievances
may be quietly communicated to the proper
sources mitigation and relief or by
becoming if need be the intrepid and incorruptible
guardian their liberties the enlightened
champion their rights
all this it appears to me can be done without
any sacrifice personal dignity without any
degrading arts popularity without any truckling
to vulgar prejudices or concurrence in vulgar
clamour but by the steady influence sincere
and friendly council fair upright and
generous deportment whatever may be said 
english mobs and english demagogues i have
never met with a people more open to reason 
more considerate in their tempers more tractable
by argument in the roughest times than the
english they are remarkably quick at dist
english country gentlemen
morning and appreciating whatever is manly and
honourable they are by nature and habit methodical
and orderly and feel the value all
that is regular and respectable they may occasionally
be deceived by sophistry and excited
into turbulence by public distresses and the misrepresentations
 designing men but open their
eyes and they will eventually rally round the
landmarks steady truth and deliberate good
sense they are fond established customs 
they are fond long established names and
that love order and quiet which characterizes
the nation gives a vast influence to the descendants
 the old families whose forefathers have
been lords the soil from time immemorial
it is when the rich and well educated and
highly privileged classes neglect their duties 
when they neglect to study the interests and
conciliate the affections and instruct the opinions
and champion the rights the people
that the latter become discontented and turbulent
and fall into the hands demagogues
the demagogue always steps in where the paenglish
country gentlemen 
trot is wanting there is a common high
handed cant among high feeding and as they
fancy themselves high minded men about putting
down the mob but all true physicians
know that it is better to sweeten the blood than
to attack the tumour to apply the emollient
rather than the cautery
it is absurd in a country like england where
there is so much freedom and such a jealousy
 right for any man to assume an aristocratical
tone and to talk superciliously the common
people there is no rank that makes him
independent the opinion and affections his
fellow men there is no rank nor distinction
that severs him from his fellow subject and if
by any gradual neglect or assumption on the
one side and discontent and jealousy on the
other the orders society should really separate
let those that stand on the eminence beware
that the chasm is not mining at their feet
the orders society in all well constituted
governments are mutually bound together and
important to each other there can be no such
 english country gentlemen
thing in a free government as a vacuum and
wherever one is likely to take place by the
drawing off the rich and intelligent from the
poor the bad passions society will rush in r
to fill up the space and rend the whole asunder
though born and brought up in a republic
and more and more confirmed in republican
principles by every year's observation and experience
yet i am not insensible to the excellence
that may exist in other forms government
 nor to the fact that they may be more
suitable to the situation and circumstances 
the countries in which they exist i have endeavoured
rather to look at them as they are
and to observe how they are calculated to effect
the which they propose considering
therefore the mixed nature the government
 this country and its representative form i
have looked with admiration at the manner in
which the wealth and influence and intelligence
were spread over its whole surface not
as in some monarchies drained from the country
and collected in towns and cities i have
english country gentlemen 
considered the great rural establishments the
nobility and the lesser establishments the
gentry as so many reservoirs wealth and intelligence
distributed about the kingdom apart
from the towns to irrigate freshen and fertilize
the surrounding country have looked
upon them too as the august retreats patriots
and statesmen where in the enjoyment 
honourable independence and elegant leisure
they might train up their minds to appear in
those legislative assemblies whose debates and
decisions form the study and precedents 
other nations and involve the interests the
world
i have been both surprised and disappointed
therefore at finding that on this subject i was
often indulging in a utopian dream rather thana
well grounded opinion i have been concerned
at finding that these fine estates were too
often involved and mortgaged or placed in the
hands creditors and the owners exiled from
their paternal lands there is an extravagance
i am told that runs parallel with wealth a lavish
vol 
ib english country gentlemen
expenditure among the great a senseless competition
among the aspiring a heedless joyless
dissipation among all the upper ranks that often
beggars even these splendid establishments
breaks down the pride and principles their
possessors and makes too many them mere
place hunters or shifting absentees it is thus
that so many are thrown into the hands government
 and a court which ought to be the
most pure and honourable in europe is so often
degraded by noble but importunate timeservers
it is thus too that so many become exiles from
their native land crowding the hotels foreign
nations and expending upon thankless strangers
the wealth so hardly drained from their laborious
peasantry having as it were their roots in their
own country but spreading forth their branches
and bearing their fruits in another i have looked
upon these latter with a mixture censure
and concern knowing the almost bigotted
fondness an englishman for his native home
i can conceive what must be their compunction
and regret when they call to mind amidst the
english country gentlemen 
sunburnt plains france the green fields 
england the hereditary groves which they have
abandoned the hospitable roof their fathers
which they have left desolate or to be inhabited
by strangers but retrenchment is no plea for
an abandonment country they have risen
with the prosperity the land let them abide its
fluctuations and conform to its fortunes it is
not for the rich to draw off from the country because
it is suffering let them share in their
relative proportion the common lot they owe
it to the land that has elevated them to honour
and affluence when the poor have to diminish
their scanty morsel bread when they have
to compound with the cravings nature and
study with how little they can do and not be
starved it is not then for the rich to fly and
diminish still farther the resources the poor
that they themselves may live in splendour in a
cheaper country let them rather retire to their
estates and there practise retrenchment let
them return to that noble simplicity that practical
good sense that honest pride which form the
 english country gentlemen
foundation true english character and from
them they may again rear the edifice fair and
honourable prosperity
on the rural habits the english nobility
and gentry on the manner in which they discharge
their duties on their patrimonial possessions
depend greatly the virtue and welfare 
the nation so long as they pass the greater
part their time in the quiet and purity the
country surrounded by the monuments their
illustrious ancestors surrounded by every thing
that can inspire generous pride noble emulation
and amiable and magnanimous sentiment
so long they are safe and in them the nation
may repose its interests and its honour but
the moment that they become the servile thronged
 court avenues and give themselves up to
the political intrigues and heartless dissipations
 the metropolis that moment they lose the
real nobility their natures and become the
mere leeches the country
that the great majority nobility and gentry
in england are endowed with high notions
english country gentlemen 
 honour and independence i thoroughly believe
they have evidenced it lately on very
important questions and have given an example
 adherence to principle in preference to
party and power that must have astonished
many the venal and obsequious courts 
europe such are the glorious effects freedom
even when infused into a constitution but
it seems to me that they are apt to forget the positive
nature their duties and to fancy that
their eminent privileges are only so many means
 self indulgence they should recollect that
in a constitution like that england the titled
orders are intended to be as useful as they are
ornamental and it is their virtues alone that
can render them both their duties are divided
between the sovereign and the subject surrounding
and giving lustre and dignity to the throne
and at the same time tempering and mitigating
its rays until they are transmitted in mild and
genial radiance to the people born to leisure
and opulence they owe the exercise their
talents and the expenditure their wealth to
 english country gentlemen
their native country they may be compared
to the clouds which being drawn up by the
sun and elevated in the heavens reflect and
magnify his splendour while they repay the
earth from which they derive their sustenance
by returning their treasures to its bosom in fertilizing
showers
a bachelor's confessions
i'll live a private pensive single life
the collier croydon
i was sitting in my room a morning or two
since reading when some one tapped at the
door and master simon entered he had an
unusually fresh appearance he had put on a
bright green riding coat with a bunch violets
in the button hole and had the air an old
bachelor trying to remunerate himself he had
not however his usual briskness and vivacity
but loitered about the room with somewhat 
absence manner humming the old song go
lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and
me and then leaning against the window and
looking upon the landscape he uttered a very 
a bachelor's confessions
bible sigh as i had not been accustomed to
see master simon in a pensive mood i thought
there might be some vexation preying on his
mind and i endeavoured to introduce a cheerful
strain conversation but he was not in the
vein to follow it up and proposed that we should
take a walk it w r as a beautiful morning 
that soft vernal temperature that seems to thaw
all the frost out one's blood and to set all nature
in a ferment the very fishes felt its influence
 the cautious trout ventured out his dark
hole to seek his mate the roach and the dace
rose up to the surface the brook to bask in the
sunshine and the amorous frog piped from among
the rushes if ever an oyster can really fall in
love as has been said or sung it must be on such
a morning
the weather certainly had its effect even upon
master simon for he seemed obstinately bent
upon the pensive mood instead skipping
briskly along smacking his dog whip whistling
quaint ditties or telling sporting anecdotes he
leaned on my arm and talked about the 
bachelor's confessions 
preaching nuptials from whence he made several
digressions upon the character women 
touched a little upon the tender passion and
made sundry very excellent though rather trite
observations upon disappointments in love it
was evident that he had something on his mind
which he wished to impart but felt awkward in
approaching it i was curious to see to what
this strain would lead but i was determined not
to assist him indeed i mischievously pretended
to turn the conversation and talked his
usual topics dogs horses and hunting but he
w as very brief in his replies and invariably got
back by hook or by crook into the sentimental
vein at length we came to a clump trees
that overhung a whispering brook with a rustic
bench at their feet the trees were grievously
scored with letters and devices which had grown
out all shape and size by the growth the
bark and it appeared that this grove had served
as a kind register the family loves from
time immemorial here master simon made
a pause pulled up a tuft flowers threw
vol 
 a bachelor's confessions
them one by one into the water and at length
turning somewhat abruptly upon me asked me
if i had ever been in love i confess the question
startled me a little as i am not over fond 
making confessions my amorous follies and
above all should never dream choosing my
friend master simon for a confidant he did
not wait however for a reply the inquiry was
merely a prelude to a confession on his own
part and after several circumlocutions and whimsical
preambles he fairly disburdened himself
 a very tolerable story his having been crossed
in love
the reader will very probably suppose that it
related to the gay widow who jilted him not
long since at doncaster races no such thing
it was about a sentimental passion that he
once had for a most beautiful young lady who
wrote poetry and played on the harp he used
to serenade her and indeed he described several
tender and gallant scenes in which he evidently
was picturing himself in his mind's eye as some
elegant hero romance though unfortunately
a bachelor's confessions 
for the tale i only saw him as he stood before
me a dapper little old bachelor with a face like
an apple that has dried with the bloom on it
what were the particulars this tender tale
i have already forgotten indeed i listened to it
with a heart like a very pebble stone having
hard work to repress a smile while master simon
was putting on the amorous swain uttering
every now and then a sigh and endeavouring to
look sentimental and melancholy
all that i recollect is that the lady according
to his account was certainly a little touched
for she used to accept all the music that he
copied for her harp and the patterns that he
drew for her dresses and he began to flatter
himself after a long course delicate attentions
that he was gradually fanning a gentle flame in
her heart when she suddenly accepted the hand
 a rich boisterous foxhunting baronet without
either music or sentiment who carried herby
storm after a fortnight's courtship master
simon could not help concluding by some obser
a bachelor's confessions
nation about modest merit and the power
 gold over the sex as a remembrance 
his passion he pointed out a heart carved on
the bark one the trees but which in the
process time had grown out into a large
excrescence and he showed me a lock her
hair which he wore in a true lover's knot in a
large gold brooch
j have seldom met with an old bachelor that
had not some time or other his nonsensical moment
when he would become tender and sentimental
talk about the concerns the heart
and have some confession a delicate nature
to make almost every man has some little
tract romance in his life to which he looks
back with fondness and about which he is apt
to grow garrulous occasionally he recollects
himself as he was at the time young and gamesome
 and forgets that his hearers have no other
idea the hero the tale but such as he may
appear at the time telling it peradventure a
withered whimsical spindleshanked old gentle
bachelor's confessions 
men with married men it is true this is not
so frequently the case their amorous romance
is apt to decline after marriage why i cannot
for the life me imagine but with a bachelor
though it may slumber it never dies it is always
liable to break out again in transient flashes
and never so much as on a spring morning in the
country or on a winter evening when seated in
his solitary chamber stirring up the fire and
talking matrimony
the moment that master simon had gone
through his confession and to use the common
phrase had made a clean breast it he became
quite himself again he had settled the
point which had been worrying his mind and
doubtless considered himself established as a
man sentiment in my opinion before we
had finished our morning's stroll he was singing
as blythe as a grasshopper whistling to his
dogs and telling droll stories and i recollect
that he was particularly facetious that day at
dinner on the subject matrimony and uttered
 a bachelor's confessions
several excellent jokes not to be found in joe
miller that made the future bride blush and
look down but set all the old gentlemen at the
table in a roar and absolutely brought tears into
the general's eyes

merrier england 
ancient phrase
there is nothing so rare as for a man to
ride his hobby without molestation i find the
squire has been repeatedly thwarted in his humours
and has suffered a kind well meaning
persecution late by a mr faddy an old gentleman
 some weight at least purse who
has moved into the neighbourhood he is a
worthy manufacturer who having accumulated
a large fortune by steam and spinning jennies
has retired from business and buried himself in
the shades the country
he has taken an old country seat and refitted
it and painted it until it looks not unlike his
own manufactory he has been particularly
 english gravity
careful in mending the walls and hedges and
putting up notices spring guns and men traps
in every part his premises indeed he shows
great jealousy in asserting his territorial rights
having stopped up a foot path that led across
one his fields and given notice in staring
letters that whoever was found trespassing
on these grounds would be prosecuted with
the utmost rigour the law he has brought
into the country with him all his trite maxims
and practical habits business and is
one those intolerably prosing sensible useful
troublesome old gentlemen that go about
wearying and worrying society with plans 
public utility
he is very much disposed to be on good
terms with the squire and is every now and
then calling upon him with some excellent measure
for the good the neighbourhood which
happens to run diametrically opposite to someone
or other the squire's peculiar notions 
but which is too sensible a measure to be
openly opposed
english gravity 
thus he has annoyed him excessively by enforcing
the vagrant laws expelling the gypsies
punishing poachers and endeavouring to suppress
country wakes and rustic games which
he considers great nuisances and causes the
deadly sin idleness i have observed however
that the manufacturer is gradually swelling
into the aristocrat he is losing sight his
origin or fancying that others have lost sight 
it and is attempting in a casual way to shuffle
himself into the pack gentility he has a
great deal to say about the common people 
talks his park his gamekeeper and the necessity
 keeping up the game laws and
makes frequent use the phrase the gentry
 the neighbourhood
he came to the hall lately with a face full 
business to consult with the squire about some
mode putting a stop to the frolicking at the village
on the approaching mayday as it drew idle
people together from all parts the neighbourhood
who spent the day fiddling and drinking
vol 
 english gravity
and dancing instead staying at home to work
for their families as the squire is at the bottom
 these mayday revels it may be supposed
that the suggestions the matteroffact
mr faddy were not received with the best grace
in the world after he was gone the squire could
not contain his indignation at having his poetical
cobwebs invaded by this buzzing blue bottle
fly traffick
in the warmth his feelings he made a
whimsical tirade at the whole race manufacturers
whom he accused being the manners
 the face the country and the destroyers 
rural manners sir said he with emotion
it makes my heart bleed to see all our fine
streams dammed up and bestrode by cotton
mills our valleys smoking with steam engines 
to hear the din the hammer and the loom
scaring away all our rural delights to see our
sturdy peasantry metamorphosed into pin makers
and stocking weavers and merry sherwood
and all the green wood haunts robin
hood covered with manufacturing towns
english gravity 
sir t have stood on the tottering ruins 
dudley castle and looked round with an aching
heart on what were once beautiful vales and
fertile hills now turned into a mere campus
phlegrae the whole country reeking with
coal pits a region fire where furnaces and
smelting houses were vomiting forth flumes and
smoke the people pale and ghastly looked
more like demons than human beings as they
toiled among these noxious exhalations and the
clanking wheels and engines seen through the
murky atmosphere looked like instruments 
torture in this terrestrial pandemonium what
is to become the country with these evils rankling
in its very core sir these manufacturers
will be the ruin the national character they
will not leave materials for a line poetry 
there was something in this in mentation
over public improvements and national industry
that amused me exceedingly but i find that the
squire really grieves over the growing spirit 
trade as destroying the charm life he considers
every new shorthand mode doing things
 english gravity
as an inroad snug sordid method and thinks
that this will soon become a mere matteroffact
world where life will be reduced to a mathematical
calculation conveniences and everything
will be done by steam
he maintains also that the nation has declined
in its free and joyous spirit in proportion
as it has turned its attention to commerce and
manufactures and that in old times when england
was an idler it was also a merrier little
island
indeed the old gentleman adduces a number
 authorities that in some measure bear him
out in his notions if we may judge from the
frequency and extravagance ancient festivals
and merrymakings and the hearty spirit with
which they were kept up by all classes people
the english were a much gayer people than
at present
stow in his survey london gives us many
animating pictures the revels on holidays at
the inns court and the mummers reasonings
and bonfires about the streets london then
english gravity 
resembled the continental cities in its manners
and amusements
the court used to dance after dinner on public
occasions after the coronation dinner 
richard the king the prelates the nobles
the knights and the rest the company danced
in westminster hall to the music the minstrels

the example the court was followed by
the middling classes who spent much the
time in dancing
stow gives us a gay city picture that resembles
the lively groups one may often see in paris
 for he tells us that on holidays after
evening prayers the maidens used to assemble
before the door in sight their masters and
dames and while one played on a timbrel the
others would dance for garlands hanged athwart
the street
 the gayety that prevailed in dress throughout
all ranks society we have abundant testimony
in the rich and fanciful costumes preserved
in books and paintings i have myself says
 english gravity
germaine markham met an ordinary tapster
in his silk stockings garters deep fringed vvith
gold lace the rest his apparel suitable with
cloak lined with velvet nashe too who
wrote in exclaims at the folly and finery
 the nation england the players stage 
gorgeous attire the ape all nations superfluities
the continual masquer in outlandish habiliments

these and many such authorities are quoted
by the squire by way contrasting the former
spirit and vivacity the nation with its present
monotonous habits and appearance john
bull he will say was then a gay cavalier
with a feather in his cap and a sword by his side 
but he is now a plodding citizen in snuff coloured
coat and gaiters
but what in fact has caused such a decline
 gayety in the national character that the
country has almost lost all right to its favourite
old title merry england it may be attributed
in part to the growing hardships the
times and the necessity turning the whole atenglish
gravity 
mention to the means subsistence but england's
gayest customs prevailed at times when
her common people enjoyed comparatively few
 the comforts and conveniences that they doat
present it may be still more attributed to
the universal spirit gain and the calculating
habits business that commerce has introduced 
but i am inclined to attribute it chiefly to the
gradual increase the liberty the subject
arid the general freedom and activity opinion
a free people are apt to be grave and thoughtful
they have high and important matters to
occupy their thoughts they feel it is their
right their interest and their duty to mingle in
public concerns and to watch over the general
welfare
the continual exercise the mind on political
topics gives intense habits thinking and
a more serious and earnest demeanour a nation
becomes less gay but more intellectually
active and vigorous it evinces less play 
the fancy but more power the imagination 
less taste and elegance but more grandeur 
 english gravity
mind less animated vivacity but deeper enthusiasm

if is when men are shut out the regions 
manly thought by a despotic government when
every grave and lofty theme is rendered perilous to
discussion and almost to reflection it is then that
they turn to the safer occupations taste and
amusement trifles rise to importance and occupy
the craving activity intellect
no being is more void care and reflection
than the slave none dances more gayly in his
intervals labour but make him free give
him rights and interests to guard and he becomes
thoughtful and laborious
the french are a gayer people than the english
why partly from temperament perhaps 
but greatly because they have been accustomed
to governments which surrounded the free exercise
 thought with danger and where he only
was safe who shut his eyes and ears to public
events and enjoyed the passing pleasure tie
day within late years they have had more opportunities
 exercising their minds and within
english gravity 
late years the national character has essentially
changed never did the french enjoy such a
degree freedom as they do at this moment 
and at this moment the french are comparatively
a grave people

gipsies
what's that to absolute freedom such as the very beggars have 
to feast and revel here to day and yonder tomorrow next day
where they please and so on still the whole country or kingdom
over there's liberty the birds the air can take no more
jovial crew
since the rencontre with the gipsies which i
have related in a former paper i have observed
several them haunting the purlieus the
hall in spite a positive interdiction the
squire's they are part a gang that has
long kept about this neighbourhood to the great
annoyance the farmers whose poultry yards
often suffer from their nocturnal invasions they
are however in some measure patronized by the
squire who considers the race as belonging to
the good old times which to confess the
private truth seem to have abounded with good
for nothing characters
gipsies 
this roving crew is called starlight tom's
gang from the name its chieftain a notorious
poacher i have heard repeatedly the
misdeeds this minion the moon for
every midnight depredation that takes place in
park or fold or farm yard is laid to his charge
starlight tom in fact answers to his name he
seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be
traced in the mornings by the mischief he has
done he reminds me that fearful personage
in the nursery rhyme 
who goes round the house at night 
none but bloody tom 
who steals all the sheep at night 
none but one by one 
in short starlight tom is the scapegoat 
the neighbourhood but as cunning and adroit
that there is no detecting him old christy
and the gamekeeper have watched many a night
in hopes entrapping him and christy often
patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose
but all in vain it is said that the squire winks
hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feels
gipsies
iris toward the vagabond because his being
very expert at all kinds games a great shot
with the cross bow and the best morris dancer
in the country
the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested
about the skirts his estate on condition
that they do not come about the house the
approaching wedding however has made a kind
 saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension
 all sober rule it has produced a
great sensation throughout the female part the
household not a housemaid but dreams wedding
favours and has a husband running in her
head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies
there is a public footpath leading across one
part the park by which they have free ingress 
and they are continually hovering about the
grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or
getting smuggled in to the young ladies
i believe the oxonian amuses himself very
much by furnishing them with hints in private
and bewildering all the weak brains in the house
with their wonderful revelations the general
gipsies 
certainly was very much astonished by the communications
made to him the other evening by
the gipsy girl he kept a wary silence towards
us on the subject and affected to treat it lightly 
but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his
attentions to lady lillycraft and her dogs
i have seen also phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's
pretty and lovesick niece holding a
long conference with one these old sybil behind
a large tree in the avenue and often looking
round to see that she w r as not observed i
make no doubt that she was endeavouring to get
some favourable augury about the result her
love quarrel with young readymoney as oracles
have always been more consulted on love
affairs than upon any thing else i fear however
that in this instance the response was not
as favourable as usual for i perceived poor
phoebe returning pensively towards the house
her head hanging down her hat in her hand and
the ribband trailing along the ground
at another time as i turned a corner a
terrace at the bottom the garden just by a
 gipsies
clump trees and a large stone urn came
upon a bevy the young girls the family
attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was
at a loss to comprehend the meaning their
blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation
until i saw the red cloak a gipsy vanishing
among the shrubbery a few moments
after i caught sight master simon and the
oxonian stealing along one the walks in the
garden chuckling and laughing at their successful
waggery having evidently put the gipsy
up to the thing and instructed her what to
say
after all there is something strangely pleasing
in these tampering with the future even
where we are convinced the fallacy the
prediction it is singular how willingly the
mind will half deceive itself and with wheat a
degree awe we will listen to these babblers
about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry
with those poor vagabonds that seek to deceive
us into bright hopes and expectations i have
always been something a castle builder and
gipsies 
have found my liveliest pleasures arising from
the illusions which fancy has cast over common
placed realities as i get on in life i find it
more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful
manner and should be thankful to any
prophet however false that should conjure the
clouds which hang over futurity into palaces
and all its doubtful regions into fairy land
the squire who as i have observed has a
private good will toward gipsies has suffered
considerable annoyance on their account not
that they requite his indulgence with ingratitude
for they do not deprecate very flagrantly op his
estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds
occasion loud murmurs in the village
for my own part i have a great toleration
for all kinds vagrant sunshiny existence and
must confess i take a pleasure in observing the
ways gipsies the english who are accustomed
to them from childhood and often suffer
from their petty depredations consider them as
mere nuisances but i have been very much
struck with their peculiarities i like to behold
 gipsies
their clear olive complexions their romantic
black eyes their raven locks their lithe slender
figures and to hear them in low silver
tones dealing forth magnificent promises 
honours and estates world's wealth and
ladies love
their mode life too has something in it
very fanciful and picturesque they are the
denizens nature and maintain a primitive
independence in spite law and gospel 
county gaols and country magistrates it is curious
to see this obstinate adherence to the wild
unsettled habits savage life transmitted from
generation to generation and preserved in the
midst one the most cultivated populous
and systematic countries in the world they
are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people
about them they seem to be like indians
either above or below the ordinary cares and
anxieties mankind heedless power 
honour wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations
 the times the rise or fall grain or
stock or empires they seem to laugh at the toilgipsies

are always to be found lurking about fairs and

times and are whimsically associated in my
mind with fairies and witches robin good fellow

mayday customs
happy the age and harmless were the dayes
for then true love and amity was found
when every village did a maypole raise
and whitsunales and maygames did abound 
and all the lusty yonkers in a rout
with merry lasses danced the rod about
then friendship to their banquets bid the guests
and poore men fared the better for their feasts
then lords castles manners towns and towers
rejoic'd when they beheld the farmers flourish
and would come downe unto the summerbowers
to see the countrygallants dance the morris
pasouil's palinodia 
the month april has nearly passed away
and we are fast approaching that poetical day
which was considered in old times as the
boundary that parted the frontiers winter and
summer with all its caprices however i like
the month april i like these laughing and
crying days when sunshine and shade seem to
run in billows over the landscape i like to
 mayday customs
see the sudden shower coming over the meadows
and giving all nature a greener smile and the
bright sunbeams chasing the flying cloud and
turning all its drops into diamonds
i was enjoying a morning the kind in company
with the squire in one the finest parts 
the park
we were skirting a beautiful grove and he
was giving me a kind biographical account
 several his favourite forest trees when we
heard the strokes an axe from the midst a
thick copse the squire paused and listened
with manifest signs uneasiness he turned
his steps in the direction the sound the
strokes grew louder and louder as we advanced 
there was evidently a vigorous arm wielding the
axe the squire quickened his pace but in
vain a loud crack and a succeeding crash told
that the mischief had been done and some child
 the forest laid low when we came to the
place we found master simon and several others
standing about a tall and beautifully straight
young larch which had just been felled
mayday customs 
the squire though a man most harmonious
disposition was completely put out 
tune by this circumstance he felt like a monarch
witnessing the murder one his liege
subjects and demanded with some asperity the
meaning the outrage it turned out to be an
affair master simon's who had selected the
tree from its height and straightness for a maypole
 the old one which stood on the village
green being unfit for farther service
if any thing could have soothed the ire my
worthy host it would have been the reflection
that his tree had fallen in a good cause and i
saw that there was a great struggle between his
fondness for his groves and his devotion to may
day
he could not contemplate the prostrate tree
however without indulging in lamentation and
making a kind funeral eulogy and he forbad
that any tree should thenceforward be cut down
ort his estate without a warrant from himself
being determined he said to hold the sovereign
power life and death in his own hands
 mayday customs
this mention the maypole struck my attention
and i inquired whether the old customs
connected with it were still kept up with any
spirit in this part the country
the squire shook his head mournfully and i
found i had touched on one his tender points
for he grew quite melancholy in bewailing the
total decline old mayday though it is regularly
celebrated in the neighbouring village
yet it has been merely resuscitated by his countenance
and is kept up in a forced state existence
at his expense he meets with continual
discouragements and finds great difficulty in
getting the country bumpkins to play their parts
tolerably
he manages to have every year a queen 
the may but as to robin hood friar tuck
the dragon the hobby horse and all the other
mostly crew that used to enliven the day with
their mummery he has not ventured to introduce
them
still i look forward with some interest to the
promised shadow old mayday even though
mayday customs 
it be but a shadow and i feel more and more
pleased with this whimsical yet harmless hobby
 my host which is surrounding him with agreeable
associations and making a little world 
poetry about him
brought up as i have been in a new country
i may appreciate too highly the faint vestiges 
ancient customs which now and then meet
with and the interest i express in them may
provoke a smile from those who are negligently
suffering them to pass away but with whatever
indifference they may be regarded by those
to the manner born yet in my mind the
lingering flavour them imparts a charm to
rustic life which nothing else could readily supr
shall never forget the delight i felt on first
seeing a maypole it was on the banks the
dee close by the picturesque old bridge that
stretches across that river from the quaint little
city chester had already been carried
back into former days by the antiquities that
venerable place the examination which is
 mayday customs
equal to turning over the pages a black letter
volume or gazing on the pictures in froissart
the maypole on the margin that poetic
stream completed the illusion my fancy adorned
it with wreaths flowers and peopled the
green bank with all the dancing revelry may
day the mere sight the maypole gave a
glow to my feelings and spread a charm over
the country for th rest the day and as i
traversed a part the fair plain cheshire
and the beautiful borders wales and looked
from among swelling hills down a long green
valley through which the deva wound its
wizard stream my imagination turned all into
a perfect arcadia
whether it be owing to such poetical associations
early instilled into my mind or whether
there is as it were a sympathetic revival and
budding forth the feelings at this season certain
it is that i always experience wherever i
may be placed a delightful expansion the heart
at the return may it is said that birds about
this time will become restless in their cages as if
mayday customs 
instinct with the season conscious the revelry
that is going on in the groves and impatient to
break from their bondage and join in the jubilee
 the year
in like manner i have felt myself excited even
in the midst the metropolis when the windows
which had been churlishly closed all winter
were again thrown open to receive the balmy
breath may when the sweets the country
were breathed into the town and flowers
were cried about the streets
i have considered the treasure flowers thus
poured in as so many missives from nature inviting
us forth to enjoy the virgin beauty the
year before its freshness is exhaled by the
heats sunny summer y
one can readily imagine what a gay scene it
must have been in jolly old london on a may
day in former times when the doors were decorated
with flowering branches when every hat
was decked with hawthorn and robin hood
friar tuck maid marian the morris dancers
and all the other fantastic masks and revellers
vol 
 mayday customs
were performing their antics about the maypole
in every part the city
i am not a bigoted admirer old times and
old customs rrterely because their antiquity
but while i rejoice in the decline many 
the rude usages and coarse amusements former
days i cannot but regret that this innocent
and fanciful festival has fallen into disuse it
seemed appropriate to this verdant and pastoral
country and calculated to light up the too pervading
gravity the nation i value every
custom that tends to infuse poetical feeling into
the common people and to sweeten and soften
the rudeness rustic manners without destroying
their simplicity indeed it is to the decline
 this happy simplicity that the decline this
custom may be traced and the rural dance on
the green and the homely mayday pageant
have gradually disappeared in proportion as the
peasantry have become expensive and artificial
in their pleasures and too knowing for simple
enjoyment
mayday customs 
some attempts the squire informs me have
been made late years by men both taste
and learning to rally back the popular feeling
to these standards primitive simplicity but
the time has gone by the feeling has become
chilled by habits gain and traffick the country
apes the manners and amusements the
town and little is heard mayday at present
excepting from the lamentations authors who
sigh after it from among the brick walls the
city
for for the hobby horse is forgot

village worthies
nay i tell you i am so well beloved in our town that not the
worst dog in the street will hurt my little finger
collier croydon
as the neighbouring village is one those
outoftheway but gossipping little places
where a small matter makes a great stir it is
not to be supposed that the approach a festival
like that mayday can be regarded with
indifference especially since it is made a matter
 such moment by the great folks at the hall
master simon who is the faithful factotum 
the worthy squire and jumps with his humour
in every thing is frequent just now in his visits
to the village to give directions for the impending
fete and as i have taken the liberty occasionally
 accompanying him i have been
 village worthies 
enabled to get some insight into the characters
and internal politics this very sagacious
little community
master simon is in fact the caesar the village
it is true the squire is the protecting
power but his factotum is the active and busy
agent he intermeddle in all its concerns
is acquainted with all the inhabitants and their
domestic history gives counsel to the old folks
in their business matters and the young folks
in their love affairs and enjoys the proud satisfaction
 being a great mart in a little world
he is the dispenser too the squire's charity
which is bounteous and to do master simon
justice he performs this part his functions
with great alacrity indeed i have been entertained
with the mixture bustle importance
and kind heartiness which he displays he
is too vivacious a temperament to comfort
the afflicted by sitting down moping and whining
and blowing noses in concert but goes
whisking about like a sparrow chirping consolation
into every hole and corner the village
 village worthies
i have seen an old woman in a red cloak hold
him for half an hour together with some long
phthisical tale distress to which master simon
listened with many a bob the head
smack his whip and other symptoms impatience
 though he afterwards made a most
faithful and circumstantial report the case to
the squire i have watched him too during
one his pop visits into the cottage a superannuated
villager who is a pensioner the
squire's where he fidgeted about the room
without sitting down made many excellent offhand
reflections with the old invalid who was
propped up in his chair about the shortness 
life the certainty death and the necessity

village worthies 
he has also his cabinet councillors in the
village with whom he is very busy just now
preparing for the mayday ceremonies among
these is the village tailor a palefaced fellow that
plays the clarion in the church choir and being
a great musical genius has frequent meetings 
the band at his house where they make night
hideous by their concerts he is in consequence
high in favour with master simon and
through his influence has the making or rather
marring all the liveries the hall which generally
look as though they had been cut out by
one those scientific tailors the flying island
 laputa who took measure their customers
with a quadrant the tailor in fact might rise
to be one the monied men the village if he
were not rather too prone to gossip and keep
holidays and give concerts and blow all his
substance real and personal through his clarion
 which literally keeps him poor both in
body and estate he has for the present thrown
by all his regular work and suffered the breeches
 the village to go unmade and unmended

while he is occupied in making garlands parti
coloured rags in imitation flowers for the
decoration the maypole
another master simon's councillors is the
apothecary a short and rather fat man with a
pair prominent eyes that diverge like those 
a lobster he is the village wise man very
sententious and full profound remarks on
shallow subjects master simon often quotes
his sayings and mentions him as rather an extraordinary
man and even consults him occasionally
in desperate cases the dogs and horses
indeed he seems to have been overwhelmed by
the apothecary's philosophy which is exactly
one observation deep consisting indisputable
maxims such as may be gathered from the mottoes
 tobacco boxes i had a specimen his
philosophy in my very first conversation with
him in the course which he observed with
great solemnity and emphasis that man is a
compound wisdom and folly upon which
master simon who had hold my arm pressed
very hard upon it and whispered in my ear
that's a devilish shrewd remark 
the schoolmaster
there will no moss stick to the stone sisyphus no grasse hang
on the heels mercury no butter cleave on the bread a traveller

her bauld in her age so the traveller in every country loseth some

among the worthies the village that enjoy
the peculiar confidence master simon is one
who has struck my fancy so much that i have
thought him worthy a separate notice it is
slingsbyby the schoolmaster a thin elderly man
rather threadbare and slovenly somewhat indolent
in manner and with an easy good humoured
look not often met with in his craft i have
been interested in his favour by a few anecdotes
which i have picked up concerning him
he is a native the village and was a convol
 
 the schoolmaster
temporary and playmate ready money jack's
in the days their boyhood indeed they carried
on a kind league mutual good offices
slingsbyby was rather puny and withall somewhat
 a coward but very apt at his learning jack
on the contrary was a bullyboy out doors
but a sad laggard at his books slingsbyby helped
jack therefore to all his lessons and jack fought
all slingsbyby's battles and they were inseparable
friends this mutual kindness continued even
after they left the school notwithstanding the
dissimilarity their characters jack took to
ploughing and reaping and prepared himself to
till his paternal acres while the other loitered
negligently on in the path learning until he
penetrated even into the confines latin and
mathematics in an unlucky hour however
he took to reading voyages and travels and was
smitten with a desire to see the world this
desire increased upon him as he grew up so
early one bright sunny morning he put all his
effects in a knapsack slung it on his back took
staff in hand and called in his way to take leave
the schoolmaster 
 his early schoolmate jack was just going
out with the plough the friends shook hands
over the farm house gate jack drove his team
afield and slingsbyby whistled over the hills
and far away and sallied forth gayly to seek
his fortune
years and years passed by and young tom
slingsbyby was forgotten when one mellow sunday
afternoon in autumn a thin man somewhat
advanced in life with a coat out at elbows
a pair old nankeen gaiters and a few things
tied in a handkerchief and slung on the 
a stick was seen loitering through the village
he appeared to regard several houses attentively
to peer into the windows that were open
to eye the villagers wistfully as they returned
from church and then to pass some time in the
churchyard reading the tombstones
at length he found his way to the farm house
 ready money jack but paused ere he attempted
the wicket contemplating the picture
 substantial independence before him in
the porch the house sat ready money jack
 the schoolmaster
in his sunday dress with his hat upon his head
his pipe in his mouth and his tankard before
him the monarch all he surveyed beside
him lay his fat house dog the varied sounds
 poultry were heard from the well stocked
farm yard the bees hummed from their hives in
the garden the cattle lowed in the rich meadow 
while the crammed barns and ample stacks bore
proof an abundant harvest
the stranger opened the gate and advanced
dubiously toward the house the mastiff growled
at the sight him but was immediately
silenced by his master who taking his pipe
from his mouth awaited with inquiring aspect
the address this equivocal personage the
stranger eyed old jack for a moment so portly
in his dimensions and decked out in gorgeous
apparel then cast a glance upon his own threadbare
and starveling condition and the scanty
bundle which he held in his hand then giving
his shrunk waistcoat a twitch to make it meet
his receding waistband and casting another
look half sad half humorous at the sturdy
the schoolmaster 
yeoman i suppose said he mr gibbets
you have forgot old times and old playmates
the latter gazed at him with scrutinizing
look but acknowledged that he had no recollection
 him 
like enough like enough said the
stranger every body seems to have forgotten
poor slingsbyby
why no sure it can't be tom slingsbyby 
yes but it is though replied the other
shaking his head
ready money jack was on his feet in a
twinkling thrust out his hand gave his ancient
crony the gripe a giant and slapping the
other hand on a bench sit down there cried
he tom slingsbyby 
a long conversation ensued about old times
while slingsbyby was regaled with the best cheer
that the farm house afforded for he was hungry
as well as wayworn and had the keen appetite
 a poor pedestrian the early playmates
then talked over their lives and adventures
jack had but little to relate and was never good
 the schoolmaster
at a long story a prosperous life passed at
home has little incident for narration it is only
poor devils that are tossed about the world that
are the true heroes story jack had stuck by
the paternal farm followed tfce same plough that
his forefathers had driven and had waxed richer
and richer as he grew older as to tom slingsbyby
he was an exemplification the old proverb
a rolling stone gathers no moss he had
sought his fortune about the world without ever
finding it being a thing oftener found at home
than abroad he had been in all kinds situations
 had learnt a dozen different modes making
a living but had found his way back to
his native village rather poorer than when he
left it his knapsack having dwindled down into
a scanty bundle
as luck would have it the squire was passing
by the farm house that very evening and
called there as is often his custom he found
the two schoolmates still gossiping in the porch
and according to the good old scottish song
taking a cup kindness yet for auld lang
the schoolmaster 
syne the squire was struck by the contrast
in appearance and fortunes these early
playmates ready money jack seated in lordly
state surrounded by the good things this
life with golden guineas hanging to his very
watch chain and the poor pilgrim slingsbyby
thin as a weasel with all his worldly effects
his bundle hat and walking staff lying on the
ground beside him
the good squire's heart warmed towards the
cosmopolite for he is a little prone to like such
half vagrant kind characters he cast about
in his mind how he should contrive once more to
anchor slingsbyby in his native village honest
jack had already offered him a present shelter
under his roof in spite the hints and winks
and half remonstrances the shrewd dame gibbets
 but how to provide for his permanent
maintenance was the question luckily the
squire bethought himself that the village school
was without a teacher a little farther conversation
convinced him that slingsbyby was
as fit for that as for any thing else and
 the schoolmaster
in a day or two he was seen swaying the rod 
empire in the very schoolhouse where he had
often been horsed in the days his boyhood
here he has remained for several years and
being honoured by the countenance the squire
and the fast friendship mr tibbets he has
grown into much importance and consideration
in the village i am v told however that he still
shows now and then a degree restlessness
and a disposition to rove abroad again and see a
little more the world an inclination which
seems particularly to haunt him about springtime
there is nothing so difficult to conquer
as the vagrant humour when once it has been
fully indulged
since i have heard these anecdotes poor
slingsbyby i have more than once mused upon
the picture presented by him and his schoolmate
ready money jack on their coming together
again after so long a separation it is difficult
to determine between lots in life where each is
attended with its peculiar discontents he who
never leaves his home repines at his monotonous
the schoolmaster 
existence and envies the traveller whose life is a
constant tissue wonder and adventure while
he who is tossed about the world looks back with
many a sigh on the safe and quiet shore which
he has abandoned i cannot help thinking
however that the man that stays at home and
cultivates the comforts and pleasures daily springing
up around him stands the best chance for
happiness there is nothing so fascinating to a
young mind as the idea travelling and there
is very witchcraft in the old phrase found in
every nursery tale going to seek one's fortune
a continual change place and change
 object promises a continual succession adventure
and gratification curiosity but there
is a limit to all our enjoyments and every desire
bears its death in its very gratification curiosity
languishes under repeated stimulants
novelties cease to excite surprise until at length
we cannot wonder even at a miracle he who
has sallied forth into the world like poor slingsbyby
full sunny anticipations finds too soon
how different the distant scene becomes when
vol 
 the schoolmaster
visited the smooth place roughens as he approaches
 the wild place becomes tame and barren
 the fairy tints that beguiled him on still fly
to the distant hill or gather upon the land he
has left behind and every part the landscape is
greener than the spot he stands on
the school
but to come down from great men and higher matters to my little
children and poor school house again i will god willing go forward
orderly as i purposed to instruct children and young men both
for learning and manners
roger ascham
having given the reader a slight sketch 
the village schoolmaster he may be curious to
learn something concerning his school as the
squire takes much interest in the'education the
neighbouring children he put into the hands 
the teacher on first installing him in office a
copy roger ascham's schoolmaster and
advised him moreover to con over that portion
 old pelham which treats the duty 
masters and which condemns the favourite
method making boys wise by flagellation
he exhorted slingsbyby not to break down or
 the school
depress the free spirit the boys by harshness
and slavish fear but to lead them freely and
joyously on in the path knowledge making
it pleasant and desirable in their eyes he
wished to see the youth trained up in the manners
and habitudes the peasantry the good
old times and thus to lay a foundation for the
accomplishment his favourite object the revival
 old english customs and character
he recommended that all the ancient holidays
should be observed and that the sports the
boys in their hours play should be regulated
according to the standard authorities laid down
in struts a copy whose invaluable work
decorated with plates was deposited in the
school house above all he exhorted the pedagogue
to abstain from the use birch an instrument
 instruction which the good squire
regards with abhorrence as fit only for the
coercion brute natures that cannot be reasoned
with
mr slingsbyby has followed the squire's instructions
to the best his disposition and abi
the school 
cities he never flogs the boys because he is too
easy goodhumoured a creature to inflict pain
on a worm he is bountiful in holidays because
he loves holidays himself and has a sympathy
with the urchins impatience confinement
from having divers times experienced its
irksomeness during the time that he was seeing
the world
as to sports and pastimes the boys are faithfully
exercised in all that are on record quoits
races prison bars tipcat trapball bandyball
wrestling leaping and what not the only
misfortune is that having banished the birch
honest slingsbyby has not studied roger ascham
sufficiently to find out a substitute or rather he
has not the management in his nature to apply
one his school therefore though one the
happiest is one the most unruly in the country
 and never was a pedagogue more liked or
less heeded by his disciples than slingsbyby
he has lately taken a coadjutor worthy 
himself being another stray sheep that has returned
to the village fold this is no other than
 the school
the son the musical tailor who had bestowed
some cost upon his education hoping to see him
one day arrive at the dignity an exciseman or
at least a parish clerk the lad grew up
however as idle and musical as his father and
being captivated by the drum and fife a recruiting
party he followed them off to the army
he returned not long since out money and
out at the elbows the prodigal son the village
he remained for some time lounging
about the place in a half tattered soldier's dress
with a foraging cap on one side his head
jerking stones across the brook or loitering about
the tavern door a burthen to his father and regarded
with great coldness by all the warm
householders
something however drew honest slingsbyby
towards the youth it might be the kindness
he bore to his father who is one the schoolmaster's
great cronies it might be that secret
sympathy which draws men vagrant propensities
towards each other for there is something
truly magnetic in the vagabond feeling or it
the school 
might be that he remembered the time when he
himself had come back like this youngster a
wreck to his native place at any rate whatever
the motive slingsbyby drew towards the
youth they had many conversations in the
village taproom about foreign parts and the
various scenes and places they had witnessed
during their wayfaring about the world the
more slingsbyby talked with him the more he
found him to his taste and finding him almost
as learned as himself he forthwith engaged
him as an assistant or usher in the school
under such admirable tuition the school as
may be supposed flourishes apace and if the
scholars do not become versed in all the holyday
accomplishments the good old times to the
squire's heart's content it will not be the fault
 their teachers the prodigal son has become
almost as popular among the boys as the pedagogue
himself his instructions are not limited
to the school hours and having inherited the
musical taste and talents his father he has
bitten the whole school with the mania he
so the school
is a great hand at beating a drum which is often
heard rumbling from the rear the school house
he is teaching half the boys the village also
to play the fife and the pandean pipes and they
weary the whole neighbourhood with their
vague pipings as they sit perched on stiles or
loitering about the barn doors in the evenings
among the other exercises the school also
he has introduced the ancient art archery
one the squire's favourite themes with
such success that the whispers roam in truant
bands about the neighbourhood practising with
their bows and arrows upon the birds the air
and the beasts the field in a word so completely
are the ancient english customs and habits
cultivated at this school that i should not be
surprised if the squire should live to see one 
his poetic visions realized and a brood reared up
worthy successors to robin hood and his merry
gang outlaws

bishop cokjbet
i have mentioned the squire's fondness for
the marvellous and this predilection for legends
and romances his library contains a curious
collection old works this kind which bear
evident marks having been much read in
his great love for all that is antiquated he cherishes
popular superstitions and listens with very
grave attention to every tale however strange 
so that through his countenance the household
and indeed the whole neighbourhood is well
vol 
 popular superstitions
stocked with wonderful stories and if ever a
doubt is expressed anyone them the narrator
will generally observe that the squire
thinks there's something in it
the hall course comes in for its share the
common people having always a propensity to
furnish a great superannuated building the
kind with supernatural inhabitants the gloomy
galleries such old family mansions the stately
chambers adorned with grotesque carvings and
faded paintings the sounds that vaguely echo
about them the moaning the wind the cries
 rooks and ravens from the trees and chimney
tops all produce a state mind favourable to
superstitious fancies
in one chamber the hall just opposite a
door which opens upon a dusky passage there
is a full length portrait a warrior in armour 
when on suddenly turning into this passage
i have caught a sight the portrait thrown into
strong relief by the dark panelling against
which it hangs i have more than once been
startled as though it were a figure advancing
popular superstitions 
towards me to superstitious minds therefore
predisposed by the strange and melancholy stories
that are often connected with family paintings
it needs but little stretch fancy on a
moonlight night or by the flickering light a
candle to set the old pictures on the walls in
motion sweeping in their robes and trains about
the galleries
to tell the truth the squire confesses that
he used to take a pleasure in his younger days
in setting marvellous stories afloat and connecting
them with the lonely and peculiar places 
the neighbourhood whenever he read any
legend a striking nature he endeavoured to
transplant it and give it a local habitation
among the scenes his boyhood many 
these stories took root and he says he is often
amused with the odd shapes in which they will
come back to him in some old woman's narrative
after they have been circulating for years
among the peasantry and undergoing rustic additions
and amendments among these may
doubtless be numbered that the crusader's
 popular superstitions
ghost which i have mentioned in the account 
my christmas visit and another about the
hardriding squire yore the family nimrod
who is sometimes heard on stormy winter
nights galloping with hound and horn over a
wild moor a few miles distant from the hall
this i apprehend to have had its origin in the
famous story the wild huntsman the favourite
goblin in german tales though by thei

bye as i was talking on the subject with master
simon the other evening in the dark avenue he
hinted that he had himself once or twice heard
strange sounds at night very like a pack 
hounds in cry and that once as he was returning
rather late from a hunting dinner he had
seen a strange figure galloping along this same
moor but as he was riding rather fast at the
time and in a hurry to get home he did not
stop to ascertain what it was
popular superstitions are fast fading away in
england owing to the general diffusion knowledge
and the bustling intercourse kept up
throughout the country still they have their
popular superstitions 
strong holds and lingering places and a retired
neighbourhood like this is apt to be one them
the parson tells me that he meets with many traditional
beliefs and notions among the common
people which he has been able to draw from them
in the course familiar conversation though they
are rather shy avowing them to strangers and
particularly to the gentry who are apt to
laugh at them he says there are several his
old parishioners who remember when the village
had its barguest or bar ghost a spirit supposed
to belong to a town or village and to predict any
impending misfortune by midnight shrieks and
failings the last time it was heard was just
before the death mr drawbridge's father
who was much beloved throughout the neighbourhood
 though there are not wanting some
obstinate unbelievers who insist that it was nothing
but the howling a watch dog
i have been greatly delighted however at
meeting with some traces my old favourite
robin good fellow though under a different
appellation from any those by which i have
 popular superstitions
heretofore heard him called the parson assures
me that many the peasantry believe in
household goblins called dobbies which live
about particular farms and houses in the same
way that robin good fellow did old sometimes
they haunt the barns and outhouses and
now and then will assist the farmer wonderfully
by getting in all his hay or corn in a single night
in general however they prefer to live within
doors and are fond keeping about the great
hearths and basking at night after the family
have gone to bed by the glowing embers when
put into particular good humour by the warmth
 their lodgings and the tidiness the housemaids
they will overcome their natural laziness
arid do a vast deal household work before
morning churning the cream brewing the
beer or spinning all the good dame's flax all
this is precisely the conduct robin good
fellow described so charmingly by milton 
tells how the drudging goblin sweat
to earn his creambowl duly set
when in one night ere glimpse morn
his shadowy flail had threshed the con
popular superstitions 
that ten daylabourers could not 
then lays him down the lubberfiend
and stretched out all the chimney's length
basks at the fire his hairy strength
and cropfull out door he flings
ere the first cock his matin rings
but beside these household dobbies there are
others a more gloomy and unsocial nature 
that keep about lonely barns at a distance from
any dwelling house or about ruins and old
bridges these are full mischievous and
often malignant tricks and are fond playing
pranks upon benighted travellers there
is a story among the old people one that
haunted a ruined mill just by a bridge that
crosses a small stream how that late one night
as a traveller was passing on horseback the
dobbin jumped up behind him and grasped him
so close round the body that he had no power
to help himself but expected to be squeezed to
death luckily his heels were loose with which
he plied the sides his steed and was carried
with the wonderful instinct a traveller's
horse straight to the village inn had the inn
 popular superstitions
been at any greater distance there is no doubt
but he would have been strangled to death as
it was the good people were a long time in
bringing him to his senses and it was remarked
that the first sign he showed returning consciousness
was to call for a bottom brandy
the only instance one the household
dobbies that the parson has met with is one
that was said to keep about the old farm house
 ready money jack it has long been traditional
i am told that one these good natured
goblins is attached to the tibbets family and
came with them when they moved into this part
 the country for it is remarked that they keep
with certain families and follow them wherever
they remove there is a large old fashioned
fireplace in the farm house which affords fine
quarters for a chimney corner sprite the kind
that likes to lie warm especially as ready
money jack keeps up rousing fires in the wintertime
the old people the village recollect
many stories that were told about this goblin in
popular superstitions 
their young days it was thought to have
brought good luck to the house and to be the
reason why the tibbets were always beforehand
in the world why their farm was always
in better order their hay got in sooner 
and their corn better stacked than that their
neighbours the present mrs tibbets at the
time her courtship had a number these
stones told her by the country gossips and when
married was a little fearful about living in a
house where such a hobgoblin was said to haunt
jack however who has always treated this story
with great contempt assured her that there was
no spirit kept about his house that he could not
at any time lay in the red sea with one flourish
 his cudgel still his wife has never got completely
over her notions on the subject she
has had a horseshoe nailed on the threshold
and keeps a branch country or mountain ash
with its red berries suspended from one the
great beams in the parlour sure protections from
all evil spirits
vol 
popular superstitions
these stories however as i before observed
are fast fading away and in another generation
or two will probably be completely forgotten
there is something however about these rural
superstitions that is extremely pleasing to the
imagination i allude to those concerning the
good humoured race household demons and
indeed to the whole fairy mythology the
english have given an inexpressible charm to
these superstitions by the manner in which they
have associated them with whatever is most
homefelt and delightful in rustic life or refreshing
and beautiful in nature i do not know a
more fascinating race beings than these little
fabled people that haunted the southern sides 
hills and mountains lurked in flowers and about
fountain heads glided through keyhole into ancient
halls watched over farm houses and dairies 
danced on the green by summer moonlight and on
the kitchen hearth in winter they seem to me to
accord with the nature english housekeeping
and english scenery i always have them in mind
when i see a fine old english mansion with its
popular superstitions 
wide hall and spacious kitchen or a venerable
farm house in which there is so much fireside
comfort and good housewifery there was something
 national character in their love order
and cleanliness in the vigilance with which
they watched over the economy the kitchen
and the functions the servants munificently
rewarding with silver sixpence in shoe the tidy
housemaid but venting their direful wrath in
midnight bobs and pinches upon the sluttish
dairy maid i think i can trace the good effects
 this ancient fairy sway over household concerns
in the care that prevails to the present day
among english housemaids to put their kitchens
in order before they go to bed
i have said too that these fairy superstitions
seemed to me to accord with the nature english
scenery they suit these small landscapes
which are divided by honeysuckled hedges into
sheltered fields and meadows where the grass
is mingled with daisies butter cups and harebells
when i first found myself among english
scenery i was continually reminded the
popular superstitions
sweet pastoral images which distinguish their
fairy mythology and when for the first time a
circle in the grass was pointed out to me as one
 the rings where they were formerly supposed
to have held their moonlight revels it seemed
for a moment as if fairy land were no longer
a fable
browne in his britannia's pastorals gives a
picture the kind scenery to which i allude
a pleasant mead
where fairies often did their measures tread
which in the meadows make such circles green
as if with garlands it had crowned been
within one these rounds was to be seen
a hillock rise where oft the fairy queen
at twilight sat
and there is another picture the same in a
poem ascribed to ben jonson
i
by wells and rills in meadows green
we nightly dance our heyday guise
and to our fairy king and queen
we chaunt our moonlight mistresses
indeed it seems to me that the older british
poets with that true feeling for nature which
distinguishes them have closely adhered to the
popular superstitions s
simple and familiar imagery which they found
in these popular superstitions and have thus
given to their fairy mythology those continual
allusions to the farm house and the dairy the
green meadow and the fountain head that fill
our minds with the delightful associations 
rural life it is curious to observe how the
most beautiful fictions have their origin among
the rude and ignorant there is an indescribable
charm about the illusions with which chimerical
ignorance once clothed every subject
these twilight views nature are often more
captivating than any which are revealed by the
rays enlightened philosophy the most accomplished
and poetical minds therefore have
been fain to search back into these accidental
conceptions what are termed barbarous ages
and to draw from thence their finest imagery
and machinery if we look through our most
admired poets we shall find that their minds
have been impregnated by these popular fancies
 and that those have succeeded best who
have adhered closest to the simplicity their
 popular superstitions
rustic originals such is the case with shakspeare
in his midsummer's night's dream
which so minutely describes the employments
and amusements fairies and embodies all
the notions concerning them which were current
among the vulgar
it is thus that poetry in england has
echoed back every rustic note softened into
perfect melody it is thus that it has spread its
charms over every day life displacing nothing 
taking things as it found them but tinting them
up with its own magical hues until every green
hill and fountain head every fresh meadow
nay every humble flower is full song and
story
i am dwelling too long perhaps upon a threadbare
subject yet it brings up with it a thousand
delicious recollections those happy days 
childhood when the imperfect knowledge i have
since obtained had not yet dawned upon my
mind and when a fairy tale was true history tome
i have often been so transported by the
pleasure these recollections as almost to wish
popular superstitions 
that i had been born in the days when the fictions
 poetry were believed even now i cannot
look upon these fanciful creations ignorance
and credulity without a lurking regret that
they have all passed away the experience 
my early days tells me that they were sources 
exquisite delight and i sometimes question
whether the naturalist who can dissect the flowers
 the field receives half the pleasure from contemplating
them that he did who considered
them the abodes elves and fairies i feel convinced
that the true interests and solid happiness
 man are promoted by the advancement 
truth yet i cannot but mourn over the pleasant
errors which it has trampled down in its progress
the fawns and sylphs the household sprite the
moonlight revel oberon queen mab and the
delicious realms fairy land all vanish before the
light true philosophy but who does not sometimes
turn with distaste from the cold realities

in an old play entitled the maids metamorphosis

i am so full nimble stratagems that i should have ordered affairs

the goblins
in one my visits to the village with master
simon he proposed that we should stop at the
inn which he wanted to show me as a specimen
 a real country inn the head quarters village
gossip i had remarked it before in my
perambulations about the place it has a deep
old fashioned porch leading into a large hall
which serves for a tap room and traveller's room
having a wide fireplace with highbacked settles
on each side where the wise men the
village gossip over their ale and hold their sessions
during the long winter evenings the
a village politician 
landlord is an easy indolent fellow shaped a little
like one his own beer barrels who is apt
to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on
one side and his hands in his pockets whilst his
wife and daughter attend to customers his
wife however is fully competent to manage the
establishment and indeed from long habitude
rules over all the frequenters the tap room as
completely as if they were her dependents instead
 her patrons not a veteran ale bibber
but pays homage to her having no doubt been
often in her arrears i have already hinted that
she is on very good terms with ready money
jack he was a sweetheart her's in early
life and has always countenanced the tavern on
her account indeed he is quite the cock 
the walk at the tap room
as we approached the inn we heard someone
talk with great volubility and distinguished
the ominous words taxes poor's rates
and agricultural distress it proved to be a
thin loquacious fellow who had got the landlord
pinned up in one corner the porch with his
 a village politician
hands in his pockets as usual listening with an
air the most vacant acquiescence
the sight seemed to have a curious effect on
master simon as he squeezed my arm and altering
his course sheered wide the porch as
though he had not had any idea entering
this evident evasion made me notice the orator
more particularly he was meagre but active
in his make with a long pale bilious face a
black beard so ill shaven as to bloody his shirtcollar
a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at
the sides into a most pragmatical shape he
had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be
commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction
 mine host at the sight master
simon the landlord was a little flurried and
began to rub his hands edge away from his corner
and make several profound publican bows 
while the orator took no other notice my companion
than to talk rather louder than before
and with as i thought something an air 
defiance master simon however as i have
before said sheered off from the porch and passa
village politician 
ed on pressing my arm within his and whispering
as we got by in a tone awe and horror
 that's a radical he reads cobbett 
i endeavoured to get a more particular account
 him from my companion but he
seemed unwilling even to talk about him assuring
me only in general terms that he was
a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded
trick talking and was apt to bother one
about the national debt and such nonsense 
from which i suspected that master simon had
been rendered wary him by some accidental
encounter on the field argument for these
radicals are continually roving about in quest 
wordy warfare and never so happy as when
they can tilt a gentleman logician out his
saddle
on subsequent inquiry my suspicions have
been confirmed i find the radical has but recently
found his way into the village where he
threatens to commit fearful devastation with his
doctrines he has already made two or three
complete converts or new lights has shaken the
 a village politician
faith several others and has grievously puzzled
the brains many the oldest villagers
who had never thought about politics or scarce
any thing else during their whole lives
he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness
 mind and body worrying about with
newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which
he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has
shocked several the staunchest villagers by
talking lightly the squire and his family and
hinting it would be better the park should be
cut up into small farms and kitchen gardens or
feed good mutton instead worthless deer
he is a great thorn in the side the squire
who is sadly afraid he will introduce politics into
the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking
community he is a still greater grievance
to master simon who has hitherto been able to
sway the political opinions the place without
much cost learning or logic but has been
very much puzzled late to weed out the doubts
and heresies already sown by this champion 
reform indeed the latter has taken complete
a village politician 
command at the tap room the tavern not so
much because he has convinced as because he
has out talked all the old established oracles
the apothecary with all his philosophy has
been as naught before him he has convinced
and converted the landlord at least a dozen times
who however is liable to be convinced and converted
the other way by the next person with
whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent
antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently
loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king
master simon and the squire she now and
then comes out upon the reformer with all the
the fierceness a cata mountain and does not
spare her own soft headed husband for listening
to what she terms such low lived politics
what makes the good woman the more violent
is the perfect coolness with which the radical
listens to her attacks drawing his face up into
a provoking supercilious smile and when she
has talked herself out breath quietly asking
her for a taste her homebrewed
the only person that is in any way a match

 a village politician
for this redoubtable politician is ready money
jack tibbets who maintains his stand in the
tap room in defiance the radical and all his
works jack is one the most loyal men in the
country without being able to reason about the
matter he has that admirable quality for a
tough arguer also that he never knows when
he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims
which he advances on all occasions and though
his antagonist may overturn them never so often
yet he always brings them anew to the field
he is like the robber in ariosto who though
his head might be cut off half a hundred times
yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling
and returned as sound a man as ever to the
charge
whatever does not square with jack's simple
and obvious creed he sets down for french
politics for notwithstanding the peace he
cannot be persuaded the french are not still
laying plots to ruin the nation and get hold the
bank england the radical attempted to
overwhelm him one day by a long passage from
a village politician 
 
a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes
in newspapers in reply he gave him
one the stanzas which he has by heart from
his favourite and indeed only author old tusser
and which he calls his golden rules 
leave princes affairs descanted on
and tend to such doings as stand thee upon
fear god and offend not the king nor his laws
and keep thyself out the magistrate's claws
when tibbets had pronounced this with great
emphasis he pulled out a wellfilled leathern
purse took out a handful gold and silver
paid his score at the bar with great punctuality
returned his money piece by piece into his
purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned
up and then giving his cudgel a stout
thump upon the floor and bidding the radical
 good morning sir with the tone 
a man who conceives he has completely done
for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity
out the house two or three jack's
admirers who were present and were afraid
to take the field themselves looked upon this
 a village politician
as a perfect triumph and winked at each other
when the radical's back was turned aye
aye said mine host as soon as the radical
was out hearing let old jack alone i'll
warrant he'll give him his own

doctor mirriemaw 
the squire has lately received another shock
in the saddle and been almost unseated by his
marplot neighbour the indefatigable mr faddy
who rides his jogtrot hobby with equal zealand
is so bent upon improving and reforming
the neighbourhood that the squire thinks in a
little while it will be scarce worth living in the
enormity that has just discomposed my worthy
host is an attempt the manufacturer to have
a line coaches established that shall diverge
 travelling
from the old route and pass through the neighbouring
village i believe have mentioned that
the hall is situated in a retired part the country
at a distance from any great coach road in
so much that the arrival a traveller is apt to
make every one look out the window and to
cause some talk among the ale drinkers at the
little inn i was at a loss therefore to account
for the squire's indignation at a measure apparently
fraught with convenience and advantage
until i found that the conveniences travelling
were among his greatest grievances
in fact he rails against stage coaches post
chaises and turnpike roads as serious causes 
the corruption english rural manners they
have given facilities he says to every humdrum
citizen to trundle his family about the kingdom
and have sent the follies and fashions town
whirling in coach loads to the remotest parts 
the island the whole country he says is traversed
by these flying cargoes every byroad is
explored by enterprizing tourists from cheapside
and the poultry and every gentleman's park
travelling ill
and lawns invaded by cockney sketchers both
sexes with portable chairs and portfolios for
drawing
he laments over this as destroying the charm
 privacy and interrupting the quiet country
life but more especially as affecting the
simplicity the peasantry and filling their
heads with half city notions a great coach
inn he says is enough to ruin the manners 
a whole village it creates a horde sots and
idlers makes gapers and gazers and news
mongers the common people and knowing
jokes the country bumpkins the squire
has something the old feudal feeling he
looks back with regret to the good old times
when journeys were only made on horseback
and the extraordinary difficulties travelling
owing to bad roads bad accommodations and
highway robbers seemed to separate each village
and hamlet from the rest the world
the lord the manor was then a kind 
monarch in the little realm around him he
held his court in his paternal hall and was
 travelling
looked up to with almost as much loyalty and
deference as the king himself every neighbourhood
was a little world within itself having its
local manners and customs its local history and
local opinions the inhabitants were fonder 
their homes and thought less wandering it
was looked upon as an expedition to travel
out sight the parish steeple and a man
that had been to london w r as a village oracle for
the rest his life
what a difference between the mode travelling
in those days and at present at that
time when a gentlemen went on a distant visit
he set forth like a knight errant on an enterprize
 and every family excursion was a pageant
how splendid and fanciful must one 
those domestic cavalcades have been when
the beautiful dames were mounted on palfreys
magnificently caparisor i with embroidered
harness all tinkling with silver bells attended
by cavaliers richly attired on prancing steeds
and followed by pages and serving men as we
see them represented in old tapestry the gentravelling

try as they travelled about in those days were
like moving pictures they delighted the eyes
and awakened the admiration the common
people and passed before them like superior
beings and they were so there was a hardy
and healthful exercise connected with this
equestrian style that made them generous and
noble
in his fondness for the old style travelling
the squire makes most his journeys on horseback
 though he laments the modern deficiency
 incident on the road from the want fellow
wayfarers and the rapidity with which everyone
else is whirled along in coaches and post
chaises in the good old times on the contrary
a cavalier jogged on through bog and mire
from town to town and hamlet to hamlet conversing
with friars and franklins and all other
chance companions f the road beguiling the
way with travellers tales which then were truly
wonderful for every thing beyond one's neighbourhood
was full marvel and romance stopvol
 
 travelling
ing at night at some hostel where the bush
over the door proclaimed good wine or a pretty
hostess made bad wine palatable meeting at
supper with travellers like himself discussing
their day's adventures or listening to the song
or merry story the host who was generally a
boon companion and presided at his own
board for according to old tusser's innhold
er's posse 
at males my friend who violet here
and sitter with his host
shall both be sure better cheer
and scape with lesser cost
the squire is fond too stopping at those
inns which may be met with here and there in
ancient houses wood and plaister or alliance
houses as they are called by antiquaries
with deep porches diamondpaned bow windows
and panelled rooms and great fireplaces
he will prefer them to more spacious and modern
inns and will cheerfully put up with bad
cheer and bad accommodations in the gratification
 his humour they give him he says
travelling 
the feeling old times insomuch that he almost
expects in the dusk the evening to see
some party weary travellers ride up to the
door with plumes and mantles trunk hose wide
boots and long rapiers
the good squire's remarks brought to mind
a visit which i once paid to the tabard inn famous
for being the place assemblage from
whence chaucer's pilgrims set forth for canterbury
it is in the borough southwark not
far from london bridge and bears at present
the name the talbot it has sadly declined
in dignity since the days chaucer being a
mere rendezvous and packing place the great
wagons that travel into kent the court yard
which was anciently the mustering place the
pilgrims previous to their departure was now
lumbered with huge wagons crates boxes
hampers and baskets containing the good things
 town and country were piled about them 
while among the straw and litter the motherly
hens scratched and clucked with their hungry
broods at their heels instead chaucer's
 travelling
mostly and splendid throng i only saw a group
 wagoners and stable boys enjoying a circulating
pot ale while a long bodied dog sat
by with head on one side one ear cocked up
and wistful gaze as if waiting for his turn 
the tankard
notwithstanding this grievous declension
however i was gratified at perceiving that the
present occupants were not unconscious the
poetical renown their mansion
an inscription over the gateway proclaimed
it to be the inn where chaucer's pilgrims slept
on the night previous to their departure and at
the bottom the yard was a magnificent sign
representing them in the act sallying forth
i was pleased too at noticing that though the
present inn was comparatively modern yet
the form the old inn was preserved there
were galleries round the yard as in old times on
which opened the chambers the guests to
these ancient inns have antiquaries ascribed the
present forms our theatres plays were originally
acted in inn yards
travelling 
the guests lolled over the galleries which
answered to our modern dress circle the critical
mob clustered in the yard instead the pit and
the groups gazing from the garret windows were
no bad representatives the gods the shilling
gallery when therefore the drama grew important
enough to have a house its own the
architects took a hint for its construction from
the yard the ancient hostel
i was so well pleased at finding these remembrances
 chaucer and his poem that i took my
dinner in the little parlour the talbot whilst
it was preparing i sat by the window musing and
gazing into the court yard and conjuring up recollections
 the scenes depicted in such lively
colours by the poet until by degrees bales boxes
and hampers boys wagoners and dogs faded
from sight and my fancy peopled the place with
the mostly throng canterbury pilgrims the
galleries once more swarmed with idle gazers
in the rich dresses chaucer's time and the
whole cavalcade seemed to pass before me
there was the stately knight on sober steed who
 travelling
had ridden in healthiness and had fought
for our faith at tramissene and his son the
young squire a lover and a lusty bachelor with
curled locks and gay embroidery a bold rider a
dancer and a writer verses singing and fluting
all day long and fresh as the month may
and his knot beaded yeoman a bold forester in
green with horn and baldric and dagger a mighty
bow in hand and a sheaf peacock arrows
shining beneath his belt and the coy smiling
simple nun with her gray eyes her small red
mouth and fair forehead her coral beads about
her arm her golden broach with a love motto
and her pretty oath by saint ely and the
marchant solemn in speech and high on horse
with forked beard and flounders bever hat
and the sleek lusty monk on berry brown palfrey
 his hood fastened with gold pin wrought
with a love knot his bald head shining like
glass and his face glistening as though it had
been anointed and the lean logical sententious
clerke oxenforde upon his halfstarved
scholarlike horse and the bowing sompnour
travelling 
with fiery cherub face all knobbed with pirnpies
an eater garlic and onions and drinker
 strong wine red as blood that carried a
cake for a buckler and babbled latin in his
cups whose brimstone visage children
were sore afford and the buxom wife 
bath the widow five husbands upon her
ambling nag with her hat broad as a buckler
her red stockings and sharp spurs and
the slender choleric reeve norfolk with
close shaven beard and hair cropped round
his ears and long lean careless legs a rusty
blade by his side bestriding his good gray stot
and the jolly limitour with lisping tongue and
twinkling eye well beloved franklins and
housewives a great promoter marriages
among young women known at the taverns in
every town and by every hostler and gay
tapster in short before i was roused from
my reverie by the less poetical but more substantial
apparition a smoking beef steak 
had seen the whole cavalcade issue forth from
the hostel gate with the brawny double jointed
travelling
red haired miller playing the bagpipes before
them and the ancient host the tabard giving
them his farewell godsend to canterbury
when i told the squire the existence 
this legitimate descendant the ancient tabard
inn his eyes absolutely glistened with delight
he determined to hunt it up the very first time
he visited london and to eat a dinner there and
drink a cup mine host's best wine in memory
 old chaucer
the general who happened to be present immediately
begged to be the party for he liked
to encourage these long established houses as
they are apt to have choice old wines
mayday
ow the bright morning star day's harbinger
comes dancing from the east and leads with her
the flow'ry may who from her green lap throws
the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose
hail bounteous may that dost inspire
mirth and youth and warm desire
woods and groves are thy dressing
hill and dale doth boast thy blessing

as i was lying in bed this morning enjoying
one those half dreams half reveries which
are so pleasant in the country when the birds are
singing about the window and the sunbeams
peeping through the curtains i was roused by
the sound music on going down stairs i
found a number villagers drest in their holyday
clothes bearing a pole ornamented with garlands
and ribbands and accompanied by the vilvol
 
 mayday
lage band music under the direction the
tailor the pale fellow who plays on the clarion
they had all sprigs hawthorn or as it is called
 the may in their hats and had brought
green branches and flowers to decorate the hall
door and windows they had come to give notice
that the maypole was reared on the green
and to invite the household to witness the sports
the hall according to custom became a scene
 hurry and delighted confusion the servants
were all agog with may and music and there
was no keeping the tongues or the feet the
maids quiet who were anticipating the sports 
the green and the evening dance
i repaired to the village at an early hour to
enjoy the merrymaking the morning was
pure and sunny such as a maymorning is always
described the fields were white with daisies 
the hawthorn was covered with its fragrant blossoms
the bee hummed about every bank and
the swallow played high in the air about the village
steeple it was one those days when
we seem to draw in pleasure with the very air
mayday 
we breathe and to feel happy we know not why
whoever has felt the worth worthy man or
has doated on lovely woman will on such a day
call them tenderly to mind and feel his heart all
alive with long buried recollections
before reaching the village i saw the maypole
towering above the cottages with its gay
garlands and streamers and heard the sound 
music i found that there had been booths setup
near it for the reception company and a
bower green branches and flowers for the
queen may a fresh rosycheeked girl the
village
a band morris dancers were capering on
the green in their fantastic dresses jingling with
hawks bells with a boy dressed up as maid
marian and the attendant fool rattling his box
to collect contributions from the bystanders
i noticed also the gipsy women already
plying their mystery in scorners the village
reading the hands the simple country
girls and no doubt promising them all good
husbands and tribes children
 mayday
the squire made his appearance in the
course the morning attended by the parson
and was received with loud acclamations he
mingled among the country people throughout
the day giving and receiving pleasure wherever
he went
the amusements the day were under the
management slingsbyby the schoolmaster 
who is not merely lord misrule in his
school but likewise master the revels to the
village he was bustling about with the perplexed
and anxious air a man who has the
oppressive burthen promoting other people's
merriment upon his mind he had involved
himself in a dozen scrapes in consequence 
a politic intrigue which by the bye master
simon and the oxonian were at the bottom 
which had for object the election the queen
 may he had met with violent opposition
from a faction ale drinkers who were in favour
 a bouncing bar maid the daughter the tavern
keeper but he had been too strongly backed
not to carry his point though it shows that
mayday 
these crowns like all others are objects 
great ambition and heart burning j am told
that master simon takes great interest though
in an underhand way in the election these
may day queens and that the chaplet is generally
secured for some rustic beauty that has
found favour in his eyes
in the course the day there were various
games strength and agility on the green at
which a knot village veterans presided as
judges the lists among these i perceived
that ready money jack took the lead looking
with a learned and critical eye on the merits 
the different candidates his hat was drawn a
little on one side over his brow which gave
additional effect to his decisions and though he
was very laconic and sometimes merely expressed
himself by a nod yet it was evident that his
opinions far outweighed those the most
loquacious
young jack tibbets was the hero the day
and carried off most the prizes though in
some the feats agility he was rivalled by the
 mayday
prodigal son who appeared much in his
element on this occasion but his most formidable
competitor was the notorious gipsy the redoubtable
starlight tom i was rejoiced at
having an opportunity seeing this minion
 the moon in broad daylight i found him
to be a tall swarthy goodlooking fellow with
a lofty air something like i have seen in an indian
chieftain and with a certain lounging easy and
almost graceful carriage which i have often remarked
in beings the macaroni order that
lead an idle loitering life and have a gentlemanlike
contempt labour
master simon and the general reconnoitred
the ground together indulging a vast deal 
harmless raking among the buxom country girls
master simon would give some them a kiss
on meeting with them and would ask after their
sisters for he is acquainted with most the farmers
families sometimes he would whisper
and affect to talk mischievously with them and
if bantered on the subject would turn it off with
a laugh though it was evident he liked to be
mayday 
suspected being a gay lothario amongst
them
he had much to say to the farmers about their
farms and seemed to know all their horses byname
there was an old fellow with a round
ruddy face and a night cap under his hat who
is the wit the village and who took several
occasions to crack a joke with master simon in
the hearing his companions to whom he
would turn and wink hard when master simon
had passed
the harmony the day however had nearly
at one time been interrupted by the appearance
 the radical on the ground with two or three
 his disciples he soon got engaged in argument
in the very thick the throng above
which i could hear his voice and now and then
see his meagre hand half a mile out the
sleeve elevated in the air in violent gesticulation
and flourishing a pamphlet by way truncheon
he was decrying these idle nonsensical amusements
in times public distress when it was
every one's business to think other matters
 mayday
and to be miserable the honest village logicians
could make no stand against him especially
as he was seconded by his proselytes when to
their great joy master simon and the general
got embroiled in the discussion i saw that the
former rather entered into it with an ill grace
from which i was persuaded that he must before
this have had a brush with the radical but the
general was too loyal to suffer such talk in his
hearing and thought no doubt that a look and
a word from a gentleman would be sufficient to
shut up so shabby an orator the latter however
was no respecter persons but rather
seemed to exult in having such important antagonists
he talked with greater volubility than
ever and soon drowned them in declamation on
the subject taxes poor's rates and the national
debt master simon endeavoured to
brush along in his usual excursive manner which
had always answered amazingly well with the
villagers but the radical was one those pestilent
fellows that pin a man down to facts and
indeed he had two or three pamphlets in his
mayday 
pocket to support every thing he advanced by
printed documents in a word the two worthies
from the hall were completely dumbfounded
and this too in the presence several master
simon's staunch admirers who had always
looked up to him as infallible i do not know
how he and the general would have managed to
draw their forces decently from the field had
there not been a match grinning through a
horsecollar announced whereupon the radical
retired with great expression contempt and as
soon as his back was turned the argument was
carried against him all hollow
in the latter part the day the ladies from
the hall paid a visit to the green the fair
julia made her appearance leaning on her lover's
arm and looking extremely pale and
interesting as she is a great favourite in
the village where she has been known from
childhood and as her late accident had been
much talked about the sight her caused very
manifest delight and some the old women 
the village blessed her sweet face as she passed
vol 
 mayday
while they were walking about i noticed the
little schoolmaster in earnest conversation with
the young girl that represented the queen 
may evidently endeavouring to spirit her up to
some formidable undertaking at length as the
party from the hall approached her bower she
came forth faltering at every step until she
reached the spot where the fair julia stood between
her lover and lady lillycraft the little
queen then took the chaplet flowers from
her head and attempted to put it on that the
bride elect but the confusion both was so
great that the wreath would have fallen to the
ground had not the officer caught it and
laughing placed it upon the blushing brows 
his mistress there was something charming
in the very embarrassment these two young
creatures both so beautiful yet so different in
their kinds beauty master simon told me
afterwards that the queen may was to have
spoken a few verses which the schoolmaster had
written for her but that she had neither wit to
understand nor memory to recollect them
mayday 
besides added he between you and i she
murders the king's english abominably so
she has acted the part a wise woman in
holding her tongue and trusting to her pretty
face
among the other characters from the hall
was mrs hannah my lady lillycraft's gentlewoman
 to my surprise she was escorted by
old christy the huntsman and followed by his
ghost a greyhound but i find they are very
old acquaintances being drawn together by
some sympathy disposition mrs hannah
moved about with starched dignity among the
rustics who drew back from her with more awe
than they did from her mistress her mouth
seemed shut as with a clasp excepting that i
now and then heard the word fellows escape
from between her lips as she got accidentally
jostled in the crowd
but there was one other heart present that did
not enter into the merriment the scene which
was that the simple phoebe wilkins the
housekeeper's niece the poor girl has 

tinned to pine and whine for some time past
in consequence the obstinate coldness her
lover never was a little flirtation more severely
punished she appeared this day on the green
gallant by a smart servant out livery and
had evidently resolved to try the hazardous experiment
 awakening the jealousy her lover
she was dressed out in her very best affected
an air great gayety talked loud and girlishly
and laughed when there was nothing to laugh at
there was however an aching heavy heart in
the poor baggage's bosom under all this levity
i saw her eye in the midst her mirth turn
with an anxious expression every now and then
in quest her reckless swain and her cheek
turned pale and her fictitious gayety vanished
on his paying his rustic homage to the little
mayday queen
my attention was now diverted by a fresh stir
and bustle music was heard at a distance 
a banner was seen advancing up the road preceded
by a rustic band playing something like
a march and followed by a sturdy throng the
mayday 
chivalry a neighbouring and rival village
no sooner had they reached the green than they
challenged the heroes the day to new trials 
strength and activity several gymnastic contests
ensued for the honour the respective
villages in the course these exercises young
tibbets and the champion the adverse party
had an obstinate match at wrestling they
tugged and strained and panted without either
getting the mastery until both came to the
ground and rolled upon the green
just then the disconsolate phoebe came by
she saw her recreant lover in fierce contest as
she thought and in danger in a moment pride
pique and coquetry were forgotten she darted
into the ring seized upon the rival champion by
the hair and was on the point wreaking on
him her puny vengeance when a buxom strapping
country lass the sweetheart the prostrate
swain pounced upon her like a hawk and would
have stripped her her fine plumage in an instant
had she not been seized in her turn
a complete tumult ensued the chivalry 
 mayday
the two villages became embroiled blows
began to be dealt and sticks to be flourished
phoebe was carried off from the field in hysterics
in vain did the sages the village interfere
i saw the sententious apothecary tumbled into
the dirt as he was endeavouring to spread the oil
 wisdom over this tempestuous sea passion
slingsbyby who is a great lover peace went
into the midst the throng as marshal the
day to put an to the commotion but was
speedily rent in twain and came out with his
garment hanging in two strips from his shoulders
 while the prodigal son dashed in with fury
to revenge the insult which his patron had sustained

the tumult thickened i caught glimpses 
the jockey cap old christy like the helmet 
a chieftain bobbing about in the midst the
scuffle while mistress hannah separated from
her doughty protector was squalling and striking
at right and left with a faded parasol being tossed
and tousled about by the crowd in such wise
as was never maiden gentlewoman before
mayday 
at length i beheld old ready money jack
making his way into the very thickest the
throng tearing it as it were apart and enforcing
peace et armis it was surprising to seethe
sudden quiet that ensued the storm settled
down into tranquillity the parties having no
real grounds hostility became readily pacified
and in fact were a little at a loss to know why
they had got by the ears the schoolmaster
was pinned together again by his wife mrs
hannah drew on one side to plume her rumpled
feathers and then swept back again to the hall
ten times more bitter against mankind than ever
the tibbets family alone seemed slow in recovering
from the agitation the scene young
jack was evidently very much moved by the heroism
 the unlucky phoebe his mother
who had been summoned to the field action
by news the affray was in a sad panic and
had need all her management to keep him
from following his mistress and having a perfect
reconciliation
 mayday
what heightened the alarm and perplexity 
the good managing dame was that the matter
had aroused the slow apprehension old
ready money himself who was very much
struck by the intrepid interference so pretty
and delicate a girl and was sadly puzzled to understand
the meaning the violent agitation in
his family
when all this came to the ears the squire
he was grievously scandalized that his mayday
fete should have been disgraced by such a brawl
he ordered phoebe to appear before him but the
girl was so frightened and distressed that she
appeared sobbing and trembling and could make
no answer to his questions
lady lillycraft who had understood there
was an affair the heart at the bottom this
distress immediately took the girl into great
favour and protection and made her peace with
the squire
this was the only thing that disturbed the harmony
 the day if we except the discomfiture
 master simon and the general by the radical
matday 
upon the whole therefore the squire had very
fair reason to be satisfied that he had rode his
hobby throughout the day without any other
molestation
the reader learned in these matters will perceive
that all this was but a faint shadow the
once gay and fanciful rites may the peasantry
have lost the proper feeling for these rites
and have grown almost as strange to them as the
boors la marcia were to the customs 
chivalry in the days the valorous don quixote
indeed i considered it a proof the discretion
with which the squire rides his hobby
that he had not pushed the thing any farther
nor attempted to revive many obsolete usages 
the day which in the present matteroffact
times would appear affected and absurd i must
say however though i do it under the rose that
the general brawl in which this festival had nearly
terminated has made me doubt whether these
rural customs the good old times were
always so very loving and innocent as we are
apt to fancy them and whether the peasantry
vol 
 mayday
in those times were really so arcadian as they
have been fondly represented i begin to fear
those days were never airy dreams
sat for the picture and the poet's hand
imparting substance to an empty shade
impos'd a gay delirium for a truth
grant it i still must envy them an age
that favoured such a dream
the manuscript
yesterday was a day quiet and repose
after the bustle mayday during the morning
i joined the ladies in a small sitting room
the windows which came down to the floor
and opened upon a terrace the garden which
was set out with delicate shrubs and flowers
the soft sunshine that fell into the room through
the branches trees that overhung the windows
 the sweet smell the flowers and the
singing the birds seemed to produce a pleasing
yet calming effect on the whole party for
some time elapsed without any one speaking
lady lillycraft and miss templeton were
sitting by an elegant work table near one the
windows occupied with some pretty ladylike
work the captain was on a stool at his mistress
feet looking over some music and poor
 the manuscript
phoebe wilkins who has always been a kind 
pet among the ladies but who has risen vastly in
favour with lady lillycraft in consequence 
some tender confessions sat in one corner with
swoln eyes working pensively at some the
fair julia's wedding ornaments the silence
was interrupted by her ladyship who suddenly
proposed a task to the captain i am in your
debt said she for that tale you read to us the
other day i will now furnish one in return if
you'll read it and it is just suited to this sweet
may morning for it is all about love 
the proposition seemed to delight every one
present the captain smiled assent her ladyship
rang for her page in green and despatched
him to her room for the manuscript
as the captain said she gave us an account
 the author his story it is but right
i should give one mine it was written by
the parson the parish where i reside a
thin elderly man a delicate constitution but
positively one the most charming men that
ever lived he lost his wife a few years since
the manuscript 
one the sweetest women you ever saw he
has two sons whom he educates himself both
 whom already write delightful poetry this
parsonage is a lovely place close by the church 
all overrun with ivy and honeysuckles with
the sweetest flower garden about it for you
know our country clergymen are almost always
fond flowers and make their parsonages perfect
pictures
his living is a very good one and he is
very much beloved and does a great deal 
good in the neighbourhood and among the poor
and then such sermons as he preaches oh if
you could only hear one taken from a text in
solomon's songs all about love and marino
none the sweetest things you ever heard
he preaches it at least once a year in springtime
for he knows i am fond it
he always dines with me on sundays and
often brings rne some the sweetest pieces 
poetry all about the pleasures melancholy
and such subjects that make me cry so you
can't think
 the manuscript
i wish he would publish i think he has
some things as sweet as any thing in moore or
lord byron
he fell into very ill health some time ago
and was advised to go to the continent and i
gave him no peace until he went and promised
to take care his two boys until he returned
he was gone for above a year and was quite
restored when he came back he sent me the
tale i'm going to show you oh here it is said
she as the page put in her hands a beautiful
box satin wood she unlocked it and from
among several parcels notes on embossed paper
cards charades and copies verses
she drew out a crimson velvet case that smelt
very much perfumes
from this she took a manuscript daintily written
on giltedged vellum paper and stitched
with a light blue ribband this she handed to
the captain who read the following tale which
i have procured for the satisfaction the reader
annette delamere
oh wander no more on the storm beaten shore
nor heed the loud whistling gale 
nor strain thy sad eye to where sea meets with sky
in search thy true lover's sail
anon
in the course a tour that i once made in

lower normandy i remained for a day or two
at the old town honfleur which standgrnear
the mouth the seine it was the timgof a fete
and all the world was thronging in jtfoe evening
to dance at the fair held before the chapel our
lady grace as i like all kings isitcent
merrymaking i joined the throng
the chapel is situated on the top a high
hill or promontory from whence its bell maybe
heard at a distance by the mariner at night
it is said to have given the name to the port 
 annette delamere
 havre de grace which lies directly opposite
on the other side the seine the road up to
the chapel went in a zigzag course along the
brow the steep coast it was shaded by trees
from between which i had beautiful peeps at
the ancient towers moniteur below the varied
scenery the opposite shore the white
buildings havre in the distance and the
wide sea beyond the road was enlivened by
groups peasant girls in their bright crimson
dresses and tall caps and i found all the flower
 the neighbourhood assembled on the green
that crowns the summit the hill
xje chapel notre dame de grace is a
favourite resort the inhabitants honfleur
and its vicinity both for pleasure and devotion

at this littk chapel prayers are put up by the
mariners r ne p ort previous to their voyages
and by their friends during their absence and
votive offerings are hung about its walls in fulfilment
 vows made during times shipwreck
and disaster the chapel is surrounded by
trees over the portal is an image the virgin
annette delamere 
arid child with an inscription which struck meas
being quite poetical 
etoile de la mer priez pour nous
star the sea pray for us
on a level spot near the chapel under a grove
 noble trees the populace dance on fine summer
evenings and here are held frequent fairs
and fetes which assemble all the rustic beauty
 the loveliest parts lower normandy the
present was an occasion the kind booths
and tents were erected among the trees there
were the usual displays finery to tempt the
rural coquette wonderful shows to entice
the curious mountebanks were exerting their
eloquence jugglers and fortunetellers astonishing
the credulous while whole rows grotesque
saints in wood and waxwork were offered
for the purchase the pious
the fete had assembled in one view all the
picturesque costumes the pays d'ange and
the cote de caux i beheld tall stately caps and
vol it 
 annette delamere
trim bodies according to fashions which have
been handed down from mother to daughter for
centuries the exact counterparts those worn
in the time the conqueror and which surprised
me by their faithful resemblance to those
which i had seen in the old pictures froissart's
chronicles and in the paintings illuminated
manuscripts any one also that has been
in lower normandy must have remarked the
beauty the peasantry and that air native
elegance which prevails among them it is to
this country undoubtedly that the english owe
their good looks it was from hence that the
bright carnation the fine blue eye the light auburn
hair passed over to england in the train
 the conqueror and filled the land with beauty
the scene before me was perfectly enchanting
the assemblage so many fresh and
blooming faces the gay groups in fanciful
dresses some dancing on the green others
strolling about or seated on the grass the fine
clumps trees in the foreground bordering the
annette delamere 
brow this airy height and the broad green
sea sleeping in summer tranquillity in the distance

whilst i was regarding this animated picture
i was struck with the appearance a beautiful
girl who passed through the crowd without
seeming to take any interest in their amusements
she was slender and delicate in her form she
had not the bloom upon her cheek that is usual
among the peasantry normandy and her
blue eyes had a singular and melancholy expression
she was accompanied by a venerable
looking man whom i presumed to be her father
there was a whisper among the bystanders and
a wistful look after her as she passed the young
men touched their hats and some the children
followed her at a little distance watching her
movements she approached the edge the
hill where there is a little platform from whence
the people honfleur look out for the approach
 vessels here she stood for some time gazing
on the sea and waving her handkerchief though
there was nothing to be seen but two or three
 annette delamere
fishing boats far below like mere specks on the
bosom the distant ocean
these circumstances excited my curiosity and
i made some inquiries about her which were
answered with readiness and intelligence by a
priest the neighbouring chapel our conversation
drew together several the bystanders
each whom had something to communicate
and from them all i gathered the following particulars

annette delarbre was the only daughter 
one the higher order farmers or small proprietors
as they are called who lived at pont
l'eveque a pleasant village not far from honfleur
in that rich pastoral part lower normandy
called the pays d'ange annette was
the pride and delight her parents and was
brought up with the fondest indulgence she
was gay tender petulant and susceptible all
her feelings were quick and ardent and having
never experienced contradiction or restraint she
was little practised in selfcontrol nothing but
annette delamere 
the native goodness her heart kept her from
running continually into error
even while a child her susceptibility was
evinced in an attachment which she formed to a
playmate eugene la forge the only son a
widow who lived in the neighbourhood their
childish love was an epitome maturer passion 
it had its caprices and jealousies and quarrels
and reconciliations it was assuming something
 a graver character as annette entered her fifteenth
and eugene his nineteenth year when
he was suddenly carried off to the army by the
conscription it was a heavy blow to his widowed
mother for he was her only pride and comfort
 but it was one those sudden bereavements
which mothers were perpetually doomed
to feel in france during the time that continual
and bloody wars were incessantly draining her
youth it was a temporary affliction also to annette
to lose her lover with tender embraces
half childish half womanish she parted from
him the tears streamed from her blue eyes as
she bound a long braid her fair hair round his
 annette delamere
wrist but the smiles still broke through for
she was yet too young to feel how serious a thing
is separation and how many chances there are
when parting in this wide world against our ever
meeting again
weeks months years flew by annette increased
in beauty as she increased in years and
was the reigning belle the neighbourhood her
time passed innocently and happily her father
was a man some consequence in the rural
community and his house was the resort the
gayest the village annette held a kind rural
court she was always surrounded by companions
 her own age among whom she shone
unrivalled much their time was past in
making lace the prevalent manufacture the
neighbourhood as they sat at this delicate and
feminine labour the merry tale and sprightly
song went round none laughed with a lighter
heart than annette and if she sang her voice
was perfect melody their evenings were enlivened
by the dance or by those pleasant social
games so prevalent among the french and
annette delamere 
when she appeared at the village ball on sunday
evenings she was the theme universal admiration

as she was a rural heiress she did not want
for suitors many advantageous offers were
made her but she refused them all she laughed
at the pretended pangs her admirers and
triumphed over them with the caprice buoyant
youth and conscious beauty with all her
apparent levity however could any one have
read the story her heart they might have traced
in it some fond remembrance her early
playmate not so deeply graven as to be painful 
but too deep to be easily obliterated and they
might have noticed amidst all her gayety the
tenderness that marked her manner towards the
mother eugene she would often steal away
from her youthful companions and their amusements
to pass whole days with the good widow 
listening to her fond talk about her boy and
blushing with secret pleasure when his letters
were read at finding herself a constant theme
 recollection and inquiry
 annette delamere
at length the sudden return peice which
sent many a warrior to his native cottage brought
back eugene a young sunburnt soldier to the
village i need not say how rapturously his return
was greeted by his mother who saw in
him the pride and staff her old age he had
risen in the service by his merit but brought
away little from the wars excepting a soldierlike
air a gallant name and a scar across the
forehead he brought back however a nature
unspoiled by the camp he was frank open
generous and ardent his heart was quick and
kind in its impulses and was perhaps a little
softer from having suffered it was full tenderness
for annette he had received frequent
accounts her from his mother and the mention
 her kindness to his lonely parent had
rendered ner doubly dear to him he had been
wounded he had been a prisoner he had been
in various troubles but he had always preserved
the braid her hair which she had bound round
his arm it had been a kind talisman to
him when wounded and in prison he had many
annette delamere 
a time looked upon it as he lay on the hard
ground and the thought that he might one day
see annette again and the fair fields about his
native village had cheered his heart and enabled
him to bear up against every hardship
he had left anne te almost a child he found
her a blooming woman if he had loved her
before he now adored her annette was equally
struck with the improvement which time had
made in her lover she noticed with secret admiration
his superiority to the other young men
 the village the frank lofty military air that
distinguished him from all the rest at their rural
gatherings the more she saw him the more
her light playful fondness former years deepened
into ardent and powerful affection but
annette was a rural belle she had tasted the
sweets dominion and had been rendered
wilful and capricious by constant indulgence at
home and admiration abroad she was conscious
 her power over eugene and delighted
in exercising it she sometimes treated him
with petulant caprice enjoying the pain which
vol 
 annette delamere
she inflicted by her frowns from the idea how
soon she would chace it away again by her
smiles she took a pleasure in alarming his
fears by affecting a temporary preference to someone
or other his rivals and then would delight
in allaying them by an ample measure 
returning kindness perhaps there was some
degree vanity gratified by all this it might bea
matter triumph to show her absolute power
over the young soldier who was the universal
object female admiration eugene however
was too serious and ardent a nature to be
trifled with he loved too fervently not to be
filled with doubt he saw annette surrounded
by admirers and full animation the gayest
among the gay at all their rural festivities
and apparently most gay when he was most
dejected every one saw through this caprice
but himself every one saw that in reality she
doated on him but eugene alone suspected the
sincerity her affection for some time he
bore this coquetry with secret impatience and
distrust but his feelings grew sore and irritable
annette delamere 
and overcame his self command a slight misunderstanding
took place a quarrel ensued
annette unaccustomed to be thwarted and contradicted
and full the insolence youthful
beauty assumed an air disdain she refused
all explanations to her lover and they parted in
anger that very evening eugene saw her full
 gayety dancing with one his rivals and
as her eye caught his his fixed on her with unfeigned
distress it sparkled with more than usual
vivacity it was a finishing blow to his hopes
already so much impaired by secret distrust
pride and resentment both struggled in his breast 
and seemed to rouse his spirit to all its wonted
energy he retired from her presence with
the hasty determination never to see her again
a woman is more considerate in affairs 
love than man because love is more the study
and business her life annette soon repented
 her indiscretion she felt that she had used
her lover unkindly she felt that she had trifled
with his sincere and generous nature and then
he looked so handsome when he parted after
 annette delamere
their quarrel his fine features lighted up by indignation
she had intended making up with him
at the evening dance but his sudden departure
prevented her she now promised herself that
when next they met she would amply repay
him by the sweets a perfect reconciliation
and that thenceforward she would never never
tease him more 
that promise was not to be fulfilled day
after day passed but eugene did not make his
appearance sunday evening came the usual
time when all the gayety the village assembled
but eugene was not there she inquired
after him he had left the village she now
became alarmed and forgetting all coyness and
affected indifference called on eugene's mother
for an explanation she found her full affliction
and learnt with surprise and consternation
that eugene had gone to sea
while his feelings were yet smarting with
her affected disdain and his heart a prey to alternate
indignation and despair he had suddenly
embraced an invitation which had repeatedly
annette delamere 
been made him by a relative who was fitting
out a ship from the port honfleur and who
wished him to be the companion his voyage
absence appeared to him the only cure for his
unlucky passion and in the temporary transports
 his feelings there was something gratifying
in the idea having half the world intervene
between them the hurry necessary for
his departure left no time for cool reflection it
rendered him deaf to the remonstrances his
afflicted mother he hastened to honfleur justin
time to make the needful preparations for the
voyage and the first news that annette received
 this sudden determination was a letter delivered
by his mother returning her pledges 
affection particularly the long treasured braid
 her hair and bidding her a last farewell in
terms more full sorrow and tenderness than
upbraiding
this was the first stroke real anguish that
annette had ever received and it overcame her
 
the vivacity her spirits were apt to hurry her
to extremes she for a time gave way to ungo
 annette delamere
enable transports affliction and remorse and
discovered by her violent exclamations the real
ardour her affection the thought occurred
to her that the ship might not yet have sailed 
she seized on the hope with eagerness and hastened
with her father to honfleur the ship
had sailed that very morning from the heights
above the town she saw it lessening to a speck
on the broad bosom the ocean and before
evening the white sail had faded from her sight
she turned full anguish to the neighbouring
chapel our lady grace and throwing
herself on the pavement poured out prayers and
tears for the safe return her lover
when she returned home the cheerfulness 
her spirits was at an she looked back with
remorse and self upbraiding at her past caprices 
she turned with distaste from the adulation 
her admirers and had no longer any relish for
the amusements the village with humiliation
and diffidence she sought the widowed mother
 eugene but was received by her with
an overflowing heart for she only beheld in her
annette delamere 
one who could sympathize in her doating fondness
for her son it seemed some alleviation 
her remorse to sit by the mother all day to
study her wants to beguile her heavy hours 
to hang about her with the caressing endearments
 a daughter and to seek by every means if possible
to supply the place the son whom she
reproached herself with having driven away
in the mean time the ship made a prosperous
voyage to her destined port eugene's mother
received a letter from him in which he lamented
the precipitancy his departure the voyage
had given him time for sober reflection if annette
had been unkind to him he ought not to
have forgotten what was due to his mother who
was now advanced in years he accused himself
 selfishness in only listening to the suggestions
 his own inconsiderate passions he
promised to return with the ship to make his
mind up to his disappointment and to think 
nothing but making iii mother happy and
when he does return said annette clasping her
 annette delamere
hands with transport it shall not be tiny fault
if he ever leaves us again 
the time approached for the ship's return
she was daily expected when the weather became
dreadfully tempestuous day after day
brought news vessels foundered or driven on
shore and the sea coast was strewed with
wrecks intelligence was received the looked
for ship having been seen dismasted in a violent
storm and the greatest fears were entertained for
her safety
annette never left the side eugene's mother
she watched every change her countenance
with painful solicitude and endeavoured
to cheer her with hopes while her own mind
was racked by anxiety she tasked her efforts
to be gay but it was a forced and unnatural
gayety a sigh from the mother would completely
check it and when she could no longer
restrain the rising tears she would hurry away
and pour out her agony in secret
every anxious look every anxious inquiry 
the mother whenever a door opened or a strange
annette delamere 
face appeared was an arrow to her soul she
considered every disappointment as a pang her
own infliction and her heart sickened under the
careworn expression the maternal eye at
length this suspense became insupportable she
left the village and hastened to honfleur hoping
every hour every moment to receive some tidings
 her lover she paced the pier and wearied
the seamen the port with her inquiries she
made a daily pilgrimage to the chapel our
lady grace hung votive garlands on the
wall and passed hours either kneeling before
the altar or looking out from the brow the
hill upon the angry sea
at length word was brought that the long
wished for vessel was in sight she was seen
standing into the mouth the seine shattered
and crippled bearing marks having been sadly
tempest tost there was a general joy diffused
by her return and there was not a brighter eye
nor a lighter heart than annette's in the little
port honfleur the ship came to anchor in
the river and shortly after a boat put off for the
vol 
annette delamere
shore the populace crowded down to the
pier head to welcome it annette stood blushing
and smiling and trembling and weeping 
for a thousand painfully pleasing emotions agitated
her breast at the thoughts the meeting
and the reconciliation that was about to take
place her heart throbbed to pour itself out
and atone to her gallant lover for all its errors
her agitation increased as the boat drew near 
until it became distressing at one moment
she placed herself in a conspicuous place where
she might at once catch his view and surprize
him by her welcome the next moment she
shrunk among the throng trembling and faint
and gasping with her emotions
it was almost a relief to her when she perceived
that her lover was not in the boat she
presumed that he had remained on board to prepare
for his return home and she felt as if the
delay would enable her to gather more selfpos
session for the meeting as the boat was nearing
the shore there were a thousand inquiries
made and laconic answers returned at length
annette delamere 
annette heard some one inquire after her lover
her heart palpitated there was a moment's
pause the reply was brief but awful he had
been washed from the deck with two the
crew in the midst a stormy night when it
was impossible to render any assistance a
piercing shriek broke from among the crowd
and annette had nearly fallen into the waves
the sudden revulsion feelings after such
wearing anxiety was too much for her frame
she was carried home senseless her life was
for some time despaired and it was months
before she recovered her health but she never
had perfectly recovered her mind it still remained
unsettled with respect to her lover's
fate
the subject continued my informer is
never mentioned in her hearing but she sometimes
speaks it and it seems as though there
were some vague train impressions in her
mind in which hope and fear are strangely
mingled some imperfect idea his shipwreck
and yet some expectation his return
annette delamere
her parents have tried every means to cheer
her up and to banish these gloomy images from
her thoughts they assemble round her the
young companions in whose society she used to
delight and they will work and chat and sing
and laugh as formerly but she will sit silently
among them and will sometimes weep in the
midst their gayety and if spoken to will
make no reply but look up with streaming eyes
and sing a dismal little song which she has learnt
somewhere about a shipwreck it makes everyone's
heart ache to see her in this way for she
used to be the happiest creature in the village
she passes the greater part the time with
eugene's mother whose only consolation is her
society and who doats on her with a mother's
tenderness she is the only one that has perfect
influence over annette in every mood the
poor girl seems as formerly to make an effort to
be cheerful in her company but will sometimes
gaze upon her with the most piteous look and
then put back her cap and kiss her gray hairs
and fall on her neck and weep
annette delamere 
 she is not always melancholy however 
she has occasional intervals when she will be
bright and animated for days together but there
is a degree wildness attending these fits 
gayety that prevents their yielding any encouragement
to her friends at such times she will
arrange her room which is all covered with pictures
 ships and legends saints and will
wreath a white chaplet as if for a wedding and
prepare wedding ornaments she will listen
anxiously at the door and look frequently at the
window as if expecting some one s arrival it
is supposed that at such times she is looking for
her lover's return but as no one touches upon
the theme or mentions his name in her presence
the current her thoughts are for the most part
merely conjecture
now and then she will rriake a pilgrimage
to the chapel notre dame de grace where
she will pray for hours at the altar and decorate
the images with wreaths that she has woven or
will wave her handkerchief from the terrace
 annette delamere
as you have seen if there is any vessel to be
seen in the distance
nearly two years he informed me had
now elapsed without effacing from her mind
this singular taint insanity still her friends
hoped it might gradually wear away they
had at one time removed her to a distant part 
the country in hopes that absence from the scenes
connected with her story might have a salutary
effect but when her periodical melancholy returned
she became more restless and wretched
than usual and privately escaping from her
friends set out on foot without knowing the
road on one her pilgrimages to the chapel
this little story entirely drew my attention
from the gay scene the fete and fixed it upon
the beautiful annette while she was yet standing
on the terrace the vesper bell was rung from
the neighbouring chapel she listened for a moment
and then drawing a small rosary from her
bosom walked in that direction several the
peasantry followed her in silence and i felt too
much interested not to do the same
annette delamere 
the chapel as i said before is in the midst 
a grove on the high promontory the inside is
hung round with miniature ships and rude paintings
 wrecks and perils at sea and providential
deliverance the votive offerings captains and
crews that have been saved on entering annette
paused for a moment before a picture the
virgin which i observed had recently been decorated
with a wreath artificial flowers when
she reached the middle the chapel she knelt
down and those who followed her involuntarily
did the same at a little distance the evening
sun shone softly through the chequered grove into
one window the chapel a perfect stillness
reigned within and this stillness was the more
impressive contrasted with the distant sound 
music and merriment the fair
i could not take my eyes off from the poor
suppliant her lips moved as she told her beads 
but her prayers were breathed in silence it
might have been mere fancy excited by the scene
that as she raised her eyes to heaven i thought
they had an expression truly seraphic but i am
 annette delamere
easily affected by female beauty and there was
something in this mixture love devotion and
partial insanity that was inexpressibly touching

as the poor girl left the chapel there was a
sweet serenity in her looks and i was told that
she w r ould now return home and in all probability
be calm and cheerful for days and even
weeks in which time it was supposed that hope
predominated in her mental malady and that
when the dark side her mind as her friends
called it was about to turn up it would be known
by her neglecting her distaff or her lace singing
plaintive songs and weeping in silence
she passed on from the chapel without noticing
the fete but smiling and speaking to many
as she passed i followed her with my eye as
she descended the winding road towards honfleur
leaning on her father's arm heaven
thought i has ever its store balms for the
hurt mind and wounded spirit and may in time
raise up this broken flower to be once more the
pride and joy the valley the very delusion
annette delamere 
in which the poor girl walks may be one 
those mists kindly diffused by providence over
the regions thought when they become too
fruitful misery the veil may gradually be
raised which obscures the horizon her mind
as she is enabled steadily and calmly to contemplate
the sorrows at present hidden in mercy
from her view

part 
on my return from paris about a year afterwards
i turned off from the beaten route at
rouen to revisit some the most striking scenes
 lower normandy has ing passed through
the lovely country the pays d'ange i reached
honfleur on a fine afternoon intending to
cross to havre the next morning and embark for
england as i had no other way passing
the evening i strolled up the hill to enjoy the
fine prospect from the chapel notre dame de
grace and while there i thought inquiring
after the fate poor annette delarbre the
priest who had told me her story was officiating
at vespers after which i accosted him and learnt
from him the remaining circumstances
he told me that from the time i had seen herat
the chapel her disorder took a sudden turn for
the worse and her health rapidly declined her
cheerful intervals became shorter and less free
delamere 
quest and attended with more incoherency she
grew languid silent and moody in her melancholy
 her form was wasted her looks pale
and disconsolate and it was feared she would
never recover she became impatient all
sounds gayety and was never so contented
as when eugene's mother was near her the
good woman watched over her with patient and
yearning solicitude and in seeking to beguile
her sorrows would half forget her own sometimes
as she sat looking upon her pallid face the
tears would fill her eyes which when annette
perceived she would anxiously wipe them away
and tell her not to grieve for that eugene would
soon return and then she would affect a forced
gayety as in former times and sing a lively air 
but a sudden recollection would come over her
and she would burst into tears hang on the poor
mother's neck and entreat her not to curse her
for having destroyed her son
just at this time to the astonishment everyone
news was received eugene who it appeared
was still living when almost drowned
 annette delamere
he had fortunately seized upon a spar which had
been washed from the ship's deck finding
himself nearly exhausted he had fastened himself
to it and floated for a day and a night until all
sense had left him on recovering he had found
himself on board a vessel bound to india but so
ill as not to move without assistance his health
had continued precarious throughout the voyage
on arriving in india he had experienced many
vicissitudes and had been transferred from ship
to ship and hospital to hospital his constitution
had enabled him to struggle through every
hardship and he was now in a distant port
waiting only for the sailing a ship to return
home
great caution was necessary in imparting
these tidings to the mother and even then she
was nearly overcome by the transports her
joy but how to impart them to annette was a
matter still greater perplexity her state 
mind had been so morbid she had been subject to
such violent changes and the cause her derangement
had been such an inconsolable
annette delamere 
and hopeless kind that her friends had always
forbore to tamper with her feelings they had
never even hinted at the subject her griefs 
nor encouraged the theme when she adverted toit
 but had passed it over in silence hoping that
time would gradually wear the traces it from
her recollection or at least would render them
less painful they now felt at a loss how to undeceive
her even in her misery lest the sudden
recurrence happiness might confirm the estrangement
 her reason or might overpower
her enfeebled frame they ventured however
to probe those wounds which they formerly did
not dare to touch for they now had the balm to
pour into them they led the conversation to
those topics which they had hitherto shunned 
and endeavoured to ascertain the current her
thoughts in those varying moods that had formerly
perplexed them they found however
that her mind was even more affected than they
had imagined all her ideas were confused and
wandering her bright and cheerful moods
which now grew seldom than ever were all
 annette delamere
the effects mental delusion at such times
she had no recollection her lover's having
been in danger but was only anticipating his
arrival when the winter has passed away
said she and the trees put on their blossoms
and the swallow comes back over the sea he
will return when she was drooping and desponding
it was in vain to remind her what she
had said in her gayer moments and to assure
her that eugene would indeed return shortly
she wept on in silence and appeared insensible to
their words but at times her agitation became
violent when she would upbraid herself with
having driven eugene from his mother and
brought sorrow on her gray hairs her mind
admitted but one leading idea at a time which
nothing could divert or efface or if they ever
succeeded in interrupting the current her fancy
it only became the more incoherent and increased
the feverishness that preyed upon both mind
and body her friends felt more alarm for her
than ever for they feared that her senses were
annette delamere 
irrecoverably gone and her constitution completely
undermined
in the mean time eugene returned to the village
he was violently affected when the story
 annette was told him with bitterness 
heart he upbraided his own rashness and infatuation
that had hurried him away from her and
accused himself as the author all her woes
his mother would describe to him all the anguish
and remorse poor annette the tenderness
with which she clung to her and endeavoured
even in the midst her insanity to
console her for the loss her son and the
touching expressions affection that were
mingled with her most incoherent wanderings
 thought until his feelings would be wound
up to agony and he would intreat her to desist
from the recital they did not dare as yet to
bring him into annette's sight but he was permitted
to see her when she was sleeping the
tears streamed down his sunburnt cheeks as he
contemplated the ravages which grief and malady
had made and his heart swelled almost to
 annette delamere
breaking as he beheld round her neck the very
braid hair which she once gave him in token
 girlish affection and which he had returned
to her in anger
at length the physician that attended her determined
to adventure upon an experiment to
take advantage one those cheerful moods
when her mind was visited by hope and to endeavour
to engraft as it were the reality upon
the delusions her fancy these moods had
now become very rare for nature was sinking
under the continual pressure her mental
malady and the principle reaction was daily
growing weaker every effort was tried to
bring on a cheerful interval the kind several
 her most favourite companions were kept
continually about her they chatted gayly 
they laughed and sang and danced but annette
reclined with languid frame and hollow
eye and took no part in their gayety at length
the winter was gone the trees put forth their
leaves the swallow began to build in the eaves
 the house and the robin and wren piped all
annette delamere 
day beneath the window annette's spirits gradually
revived she began to deck her person
with unusual care and bringing forth a basket 
artificial flowers she went to work to wreathe
a bridal chaplet white roses her companions
asked her why she prepared the chaplet
 what said she with a smile have
you not noticed the trees putting on their wedding
dresses blossoms has not the swallow
flown back over the sea do you not know that
the time is come for eugene to return that he
will be home tomorrow and that on sunday
we are to be married 
her words were reported to the physician
and he seized on them at once he directed
that her idea should be encouraged and acted
upon her words were echoed through the
house every one talked the return eugene
as a matter course they congratulated
her upon her approaching happiness and assisted
her in her preparations the next morning
the same theme was resumed she was dressed
out to receive her lover every bosom fluttered
vol n 
 annette delamere
with anxiety a cabriolet drove into the village
 eugene is coming was the cry she
saw him alight at the door and rushed with a
shriek into his arms
her friends trembled for the result this
critical experiment but she did not sink under
it for her fancy had prepared her for his return
she was as one in a dream to whom a tide 
unlocked for prosperity that would have overwhelmed
his waking reason seems but the natural
current circumstances her conversation
however showed that her senses were
wandering there was an absolute forgetfulness
 all past sorrow a wild and feverish
gayety that at times was incoherent
the next morning she awoke languid and exhausted
all the occurrences the preceding
day had passed away from her mind as though
they had been the mere illusions her fancy
she rose melancholy and abstracted and as she
dressed herself was heard to sing one her
plaintive ballads when she entered the parlour
her eyes were swoln with weeping shea

annette delamere 
heard eugene's voice without and started she
passed her hand across her forehead and stood
musing like one endeavouring to recall a dream
eugene entered the room and advanced towards
her she looked at him with an eager searching
look murmured some indistinct words and before
he could reach her sunk upon the floor
she relapsed into a wild and unsettled state 
mind butnow that the first shock was over the
physician ordered that eugene should keep continually
in her sight sometimes she did not
know him at other times she would talk to him
as if he were going to sea and would implore
him not to part from her in anger and when he
was not present she would speak him as buried
in the ocean and would sit with clasped hands
looking upon the ground the picture despair

as the agitation her feelings subsided and
her frame recovered from the shock which it
had received she became more placid and coherent
eugene kept almost continually near her
he formed the real object round which her 
annette delamere
tered ideas once more gathered and which linked
them once mor with the realities life but
her changeful disorder now appeared to take a
new turn she became languid and inert and
would sit for hours silent and almost in a state 
lethargy if roused from this stupor it seemed
as if her mind would make some attempts to
follow up a train thought but soon became
confused she would regard every one that approached
her with an anxious and inquiring eye
that seemed continually to disappoint itself
sometimes as her lover sat holding her hand she
would look pensively in his face without saying
a word until his heart was overcome and after
these transient fits intellectual exertion she
would sink again into lethargy
by degrees this stupor increased her mind
appeared to have subsided into a stagnant and
almost deathlike calm for the greater part 
the time her eyes were closed her face almost
as fixed and passionless as that a
corpse she no longer took any notice 
surrounding objects there was an awfulness
annette delamere 
in this tranquillity that filled her friends with
apprehension the physician ordered that she
should be kept perfectly quiet or that if she
evinced any agitation she should be gently lulled
like a child by some favourite tune
she remained in this state for hours hardly
seeming to breathe and apparently sinking into
the sleep death her chamber was profoundly
still the attendants moved about it
with noiseless tread every thing was communicated
by signs and whispers her lover sat by
her side watching her with painful anxiety and
fearing that every breath which stole from her
pale lips would be the last
at length she heaved a deep sigh and from
some convulsive motions appeared to be troubled
in her sleep her agitation increased accompanied
by an indistinct moaning one 
her companions remembering the physician's instructions
endeavoured to lull her by singing
in a low voice a tender little air which was a
particular favourite annette's probably it
had some connection in her mind with her story 
 annette delamere
for every fond girl has some ditty the kind
linked in her thoughts with sweet and sad remembrances

as she sang the agitation annette subsided
a streak faint colour came into her
cheeks her eyelids became swoln with rising
tears w r which trembled there for a moment and
then stealing forth coursed down her pallid
cheek when the song was ended she opened
her eyes and looked about her as one awaking
in a strange place
oh eugene eugene said she it seems
as if i have had a long and dismal dream what
has happened and what has been the matter
with me 
the questions were embarrassing and before
they could be answered the physician who was
in the next room entered she took him by the
hand looked up in his face and made the same
inquiry he endeavoured to put her off with
some evasive answer no no cried she
i know i've been ill and i have been dreaming
strangely i thought eugene had left us and
annette delamere 
that he had gone to sea and that and that he
was drowned but he has been to sea added
she earnestly as recollection kept flashing
upon her and he has been wrecked and we
were all so wretched and he came home again
one bright morning and oh said she
pressing her hand against her forehead with a
sickly smile i see how it is all has not been
right here i begin to recollect but it is all
past now eugene is here and his mother is
happy and we shall never never part again
shall we eugene 
she sunk back in her chair exhausted the
tears streamed down her cheeks her companions
hovered round her not knowing what to
make this sudden dawn reason her lover
sobbed aloud she opened her eyes again and
looked upon them with an air the sweetest
acknowledgment you are all so good to me 
said she faintly
the physician drew the father aside your
daughter's mind is restored said he she is
sensible that she has been deranged she is
 annette delamere
growing conscious the past and conscious 
the present all that now remains is to keep
her calm and quiet until her health is reesta
blushed and then let her be married in god's
name 
the wedding took place said the good
priest but a short time since they were hereat
the last fete during their honey moon and a
handsomer and happier couple was not to be seen
as they danced under yonder trees the young
man his wife and mother now live on a fine
farm at pont l'eveque and that model a
ship which you see yonder with white flowers
wreathed round it is annette's offering thanks
to our lady grace for having listened to her
prayers and protected her lover in the hour 
peril
annette delamere 
the captain having finished there was a
momentary silence the tender hearted lady
lillycraft who knew the story by heart had led
the way in weeping and indeed had often begun
to shed tears before they had come to the
right place the fair julia was a little flurried
at the passage where wedding preparations were
mentioned but the auditor most affected was the
simple phoebe wilkins she had gradually
dropt her work in her lap and sat sobbing through
the latter part the story until towards the 
when the happy reverse had nearly produced
another scene hysterics go take this
case to my room again child said lady lillycraft
kindly and don't cry so much
i won't an't please your ladyship if i can
help it but i'm glad they made all up again
and were married
by the way the case this lovelorn damsel
begins to make some talk in the household esvol
n 
 annette delamere
specially among certain little ladies not far in
their teens whom she has made confidants
she is a great favourite with them all but
particularly so since she has confided to them
her love secrets
they enter into her concerns with all the
violent zeal and overwhelming sympathy with
which little boarding school ladies engage in the
politics a love affair i have noticed them
frequently clustering about her in private conferences
 or walking up and down the garden
terrace under my window listening to some long
and dolorous story her afflictions which
i could now and then distinguish the ever recurring
phrases says he and says she
i accidentally interrupted one these little
councils war when they were all huddled together
under a tree and seemed to be earnestly
considering some interesting document
the flutter at my approach showed that there
were some secrets under discussion and i observed
the disconsolate phoebe crumpling into
her bosom either a love letter or an old valentine
and brushing away the tears from her cheeks
annette delamere 
the girl is a good girl a soft melting nature
and shows her concern at the cruelty 
her lover only in tears and drooping looks but
with the little ladies who have espoused her
cause it sparkles up into fiery indignation and
i have noticed on sunday many a glance
darted at the pew the tibbets enough to
melt down the silver buttons on old ready mos
jacket
the c u l p r i t 
from fire from water and all things amiss
deliver the house an honest justice
the widow
the serenity the hall has been suddenly
interrupted by a very important occurrence in
the course this morning a posse villagers
was seen trooping up the avenue with boys
shouting in advance as it drew near we perceived
ready money jack tibbets striding
along wielding his cudgel in one hand and
with the other grasping the collar a tall fellow
whom on still nearer approach we recognised
for the redoubtable gipsy hero starlight
tom he was now however completely
the culprit 
cowed and crestfallen and his courage seemed
to have quailed in the iron gripe the lionhearted
jack
the whole gang gipsy women and children
came draggling in the rear some in tears others
making a violent clamour about the ears old
ready money who however trudged on in
silence with his prey heeding their abuse as little
as a hawk that has pounced upon a barn
door hero regards the outcries and cackling 
his whole feathered seraglio
he had passed through the village on his was
to the hall and course had made a great
sensation in that most excitable place where
every event is a matter gaze and gossip the
report had circulated like wildfire that old gibbets
had taken starlight tom prisoner the
ale drinkers forthwith abandoned the tap room
slingsbyby's school broke loose without waiting to
be dismissed and masters and boys swelled the
tide that came rolling at the heels old ready
money and his captive the uproar increased
as they approached the hall it aroused the
the culprit
whole garrison dogs and the crew hangers
on the great mastiff barked from the dog
house the stag hound and the greyhound and
the spaniel came barking from the hall door and
my lady lillycraft's little dogs barked from the
parlour windows i remarked however that
the gipsy dogs made no reply to all these menaces
and insults but crept close to the gang
looking round with a guilty poaching air and
now and then glancing up a dubious eye to their
owners which shows that the moral characters
even dogs may be ruined by bad company 
when the throng reached the front the
house they were brought to a halt by a kind 
advanced guard composed old christy the
gamekeeper and two or three servants the
house who had been brought out by the noise
the common herd the village fell back with
respect the boys were driven back by old
christy and his compeers while ready money
jack maintained his ground and his hold the
prisoner and was surrounded by the tailor the
schoolmaster and several other dignitaries the
the culprit
village and by the clamorous brood gipsies
who were neither to be silenced nor intimidated
by this time the whole household were brought
to the doors and windows and the squire to the
portal an audience was demanded by ready
money jack who had detected the prisoner in
the very act sheep stealing on his domains
and had borne him off to be examined before
the squire who is in the commission the
peace
a kind tribunal was immediately held in
the servant's hall a large chamber with a stone
floor and a long table in the centre at one 
 which just under an enormous clock was
placed the squire's chair justice while master
simon took his place at the table as clerk 
the court an attempt had been made by old
christy to keep out the gipsy gang but in vain 
and they with the village worthies and the
household half filled the hall the old housekeeper
and the butler were in a panic at this dangerous
irruption they hurried away all the
valuable things and portable articles that were at
 the culprit
hand and even kept a dragon watch on the gipsies
lest they should carry off the house clock or
the deal table
old christy and his faithful coadjutor the
gamekeeper acted as constables to guard the
prisoner and appeared to triumph in having at
last got this terrible nightwalking offender in
their clutches by the bye i am inclined to suspect
that the old huntsman bore some peevish
recollection having been handled rather roughly
by the gipsy in the chance medley affray 
mayday
silence was now commanded by master simon
but it was difficult to be enforced in such a mostly
assemblage there was a continual snarling
and yelping dogs and as fast as it was quelled
in one corner it broke out in another the
poor gipsy curs who like arrant thieves could
not hold up their heads in an honest house were
worried and insulted by the gentlemen dogs 
the establishment without offering to make resistance
 the very curs my lady lillycraft
bullied them with impunity
the culprit 
the examination was conducted with great
mildness and indulgence by the squire partly
from the kindness his nature and partly i
suspect because his heart yearned towards the
culprit who as i have before mentioned had
found great favour in his eyes from the skill he
had at various times displayed in archery morrice
dancing and other obsolete accomplishments
proofs however were too strong ready
money jack told his story in a straight forward
independent way nothing daunted by the presence
in which he found himself he had suffered
from various depredations on his sheepfold
and poultry yard and had at length kept watch
and caught the delinquent in the very act 
making off with a sheep on his shoulders
tibbets was repeatedly interrupted in the
course his testimony by the culprit's mother
a furious old beldame with an insufferable tongue
and who in fact was several times on the point
 flying at him tooth and nail the wife 
the prisoner whom i am told he does not beat
above half a dozen times a week completely in
vol 
 the culprit
treated lady lillycraft in her husband's behalf
by her tears and supplications and several the
other gipsy women were awakening strong sympathy
among the young girls and maid servants
in the back ground the pretty black eyed
gipsy girl whom i have mentioned on a former
occasion as the sybil that read the fortunes 
the general now endeavoured to wheedle that
doughty warrior into their interests and even
made some approaches to her old acquaintance
master simon but was repelled by the latter
with all the dignity office having assumed a
gravity and importance suitable to the occasion
i was a little surprised at first to find honest
slingsbyby the schoolmaster rather opposed to his
old crony tibbets and coming forward as a
kind advocate for the accused it seems that
he had taken compassion on the forlorn fortunes
 starlight tom arid had been trying his eloquence
in his favour the whole way from the village
but without effect during the examination
 ready money jack also slingsbyby had
stood like dejected pity at his side seeking
the culprit 
every now and then by a soft word to soothe any
exacerbation his ire or to qualify any harsh
expression he now ventured to make a few
observations to the squire in palliation the
delinquent's offences but poor slingsbyby spoke
more from the heart than the head and was evidently
actuated merely by a general sympathy
for any poor devil in trouble and a liberal toleration
for all kinds vagabond existence
the ladies too large and small with the
kindheartedness the sex were zealous on the
side mercy and interceded strenuously with
the squire insomuch that the prisoner finding
himself unexpectedly surrounded by active
friends once more reared his crest and seemed
disposed for a time to put on the airs injured
innocence the squire however with all his
benevolence heart and his lurking weakness
towards the prisoner was too conscientious
to swerve from the strict path justice there
was abundant concurring testimony that made
the proof guilt incontrovertible and starlight
tom's mittimus was made out accordingly
 the culprit
the sympathy the ladies was now greater
than ever they even made some attempts to
mollify the ire ready money jack but that
sturdy potentate had been too much incensed
by the repeated incursions that had been made
into his territories by the predatory band 
starlight tom and he was resolved he said
to drive the garment reptiles out the
neighbourhood to avoid all further importunities
as soon as the mittimus was made out
he girded up his loins and strode back to his
seat empire accompanied by his interceding
friend slingsbyby and followed by a detachment
 the gipsy gang who hung on his rear assailing
him with mingled prayers and declarations

the question now was how to dispose the
prisoner a matter great moment in this
peaceful establishment where so formidable a
character as starlight torn was like a hawk
entrapped in a dove cote as the hubbub and
examination had occupied a considerable time
it was too late in the day to send him to the
the culprit 
county prison and that the village was sadly
out repair from long want occupation
old christy who took great interest in the affair
proposed that the culprit should be committed
for the night to an upper loft a kind tower
in one the outhouses where he and the
gamekeeper would mount guard after much
deliberation this measure was adopted the premises
in question were examined and made secure
and christy and his trusty ally the one
armed with a fowling piece the other with an
ancient blunderbuss turned out as sentries to
keep watch over this donjon keep
such is the momentous affair that has just
taken place and it is an event too great moment
in this quiet little world not to turn it
completely topsyturvy labour is at a stand
the house has been a scene confusion the
whole evening the mansion has been beleaguered
by gipsy women with their children on
their backs wailing and lamenting while the old
virago a mother has cruised up and down before
the house shaking her head and muttering
 the culprit
to herself and now and then breaking into a
paroxysm rage brandishing her fist at the
hall and denouncing ill luck upon ready money
jack and even upon the squire himself
lady lillycraft has given repeated audiences
to the culprit's weeping wife at the hall door and
the servant maids have stole out to confer with
the gipsy women under the trees as to the
little ladies the family they are all outrageous
at ready money jack whom they look upon
in the light a tyrannical giant fairy tale
phoebe wilkins contrary to her usual nature
is the only female that is pitiless in this affair
she thinks mr tibbets quite in the right and
thinks the gipsies deserve to be punished severely
for meddling with the sheep the tibbets
in the mean time the females the family
have evinced all the provident kindness the
sex ever ready to soothe and succour the distressed
right or wrong lady lillycraft has had a
mattress taken to the outhouse and comforts
and delicacies all kinds have been taken to the
prisoner even the little girls have sent their
the culprit 
cakes and sweetmeats so that i'll warrant the
vagabond has never fared so well in his life before
old christy it is true looks upon everything
with a waryee struts about with his
blunderbuss with the air a veteran campaigner
keeps every one at bay and will hardly allow
himself to be spoken to the gipsy women
dare not come within gunshot and every tatterdemalion
 a boy has been frightened from the
park the old fellow is determined to lodge
starlight tom in prison with his own hands
and hopes he says to see one the poaching
crew made an example 
i doubt after all whether the worthy squire
is not the greatest sufferer in the whole affair
his honourable sense duty obliges him to be
rigid but the overflowing kindness his nature
makes this a grievous trial to him he is
not accustomed to have such demands upon his
justice in his truly patriarchal domain and it
wounds his benevolent spirit that while prosperity
and happiness are flowing in thus bounds
the culprit
teouslj upon him he should have to inflict
misery upon fellow being
he has been troubled and cast down the whole
evening took leave the family on going to
bed with a sigh instead his usual hearty and
affectionate tone and will in all probability have
a far more sleepless night than his prisoner indeed
this unlucky affair has cast a damp upon the
whole household as there appears to be an
universal opinion that the unlucky culprit will
come to the gallows
morning the clouds last evening are
all blown over a load has been taken from
the squire's heart and every face is once more
in smiles the gamekeeper made his appearance
at an early hour completely shamefaced
and chapfallen starlight tom had made his
escape in the night how he had got out the
loft no one could tell the devil must have assisted
him old christy was so mortified that
he would not show his face but had shut himself
up in his strong hold at the dogkennel and
the culprit 
would not be spoken with what has particularly
relieved the squire is that there is very
little likelihood the culprit's being retaken
having gone off on one the old gentleman's
best hunters
vol 
the historian
i have forborne to recount various tales which
have been told during the evenings at the hall
because some them were rather hackneyed
and tedious and others i did not feel warranted
in betraying into print i was suddenly startled
lately by a call from the squire to furnish a story
in my turn and having been a profound listener
to those others i could not in conscience refuse
 so i begged leave to read a manuscript tale
from the pen the late mr heinrich knickerbocker
the historian new york
as some curiosity was expressed about the author
i had to explain that he was a native 
new york a descendant one the ancient
dutch families that originally settled that province
and remained there after it was taken
possession by the english in that
the historian s
the descendants these dutch families still remained
in villages and neighbourhoods in various
parts the country retaining with singular
fidelity the dresses manners and even language
 their ancestors and forming a very distinct
and curious feature in the population the
state
that mr knickerbocker had written a history
 his native city comprising the reign the
three first governors who held a delegated sway
under the hogen moyens holland that in
this the worthy little dutchman had displayed
great historical research and a wonderful sense
 the dignity his subject but that his work
had been so little understood as to be pronounced
a mere work humour satirizing the follies
 the times in politics and morals and giving
whimsical views human nature
that among the papers left behind him were
several tales a lighter nature apparently
thrown together from materials which he had
gathered during his profound researches for his
history and which he seemed to have thrown
 the historian
by with neglect as unworthy publication
that these had fallen into my hands by an accident
which it was needless to mention and one
 those stories with its prelude in the words 
mr knickerbocker i now undertook to read
by way acquitting myself the debt which
i owed to the other storytellers in company
the haunted house
from the mss the late heinrich knickerbocker
formerly almost every place had a house this kind if a house
was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic
manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such
as murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a
mark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the habitation a
bourne s antiquities
in the neighbourhood the ancient city 
manhattoes there stood not very many years
since an old mansion which when i was a boy
went by the name the haunted house it was
one the very few remains the architecture
 the early dutch settlers and must have been
a house some consequence at the time when
it was built it consisted a centre and two
wings the gable ends which were shaped
like stairs it was built partly wood and
 the haunted house
partly small dutch bricks such as the worthy
colonists brought with them from holland 
before they discovered that bricks could be
manufactured elsewhere the house stood remote
from the road in the centre a large
field with an avenue old locust trees leading
up to it several which had been shivered
by lightning and two or three blown down
a few apple trees grew straggling about the
field there were traces also what had been
a kitchen garden but the fences were broken
down the vegetables had disappeared or had
grown wild and turned to little better than
weeds with here and there a ragged rose bush
or a tall sunflower shooting up from among the
brambles and hanging its head sorrowfully as
if contemplating the desolation around it part
 the roof the old house had fallen in the
windows were shattered the pannels the
doors broken and mended with rough boards 
and there were two rusty weathercocks at the
ends the house which made a great jingling
acacias
the haunted house 
and whistling as they whirled about but always
poiutecl wrong the appearance the whole
was forlorn and desolate at the best times 
but in unruly weather the howling the wind
about the crazy old mansion the screeching 
the weathercocks the slamming and banging
 a few loose window shutters had altogether
so wild and dreary an effect that the neighbourhood
stood perfectly in awe the place and
pronounced it the rendezvous hobgoblins i
recollect the old building well for i recollect
how many times when an idle unlucky urchin
i have prowled round its precincts with some
 my graceless companions on holyday afternoons
when out on a freebooting cruise among
the orchards
there was a tree standing near the house
that bore the most beautiful and tempting fruit 
but then it was on enchanted ground for the
place was so charmed by frightful stories that we
dreaded to approach it sometimes we would
venture in a body and get near the hesperian
tree keeping an eye upon the old mansion and
 the haunted house
darting fearful glances into its shattered windows
 when just as we were about tf seize
upon our prize an exclamation from some one
 the gang or an accidental noise would throw
us all into a panic and we wo old scamper headlong
from the place nor ever stop until we had
got quite into the road then there were sure
to be a host anecdotes told about strange
cries and groans or some hideous face suddenly
seen staring out one the windows
by degrees we ceased to venture into these lonely
grounds but would stand at a distance and
throw stones at the building and there was something
fearfully pleasing in the sound as they
rattled along the roof or sometimes struck some
jingling fragments glass out the windows
the origin the house was lost in the obscurity
that covers the early period the province
whilst under the government their high
mightiness the states general some reported
it to have been a country residence wilhelm
kieft commonly called the testy one 
the dutch governors newamsterdam others
the haunted house 
said that it had been built by a naval commander
who served under van tromp and who on
being disappointed preferment retired from
the service in disgust became a philosopher
through sheer spire and brought over all his
wealth to the province that he might live according
to his humour and despise the world the
reason its having fallen to decay was likewise
a matter dispute some said that it was in
chancery and had already cost more than its
worth in legal expenses but the most current
and course the most probable account was
that it was haunted and that nobody could live
quietly in it there can in fact be very little
doubt that this last was the case there were so
many corroborating stories to prove it riot an
old woman in the neighbourhood but could furnish
at least a score there was a gray headed
curmudgeon a negro that lived hard by who
had a whole budget them to tell many 
which had happened to himself
i recollect many a time stopping with my
vol n 
 the haunted house
schoolmates and getting him to relate some
the old crone lived in a hovel in the midst a
small patch potatoes and indian corn which
his master had given him on setting him free
he would come to us with his hoe in his hand
and as we sat perched like a row swallows
on the rail the fence in the mellow twilight
 a summer evening he would tell us such
fearful stories accompanied by such awful
rolling his white eyes that we wre almost
afraid our own footsteps as we returned home
afterwards in the dark
poor old pompey many years are past since
he died and went to keep company with the
ghosts he was so fond talking about
he was buried in a corner his own little
ito patch the plough soon passed over his
ive and levelled it with the rest the field
and nobody thought any more the gray headed
negro by singular chance i was strolling in
that neighbourhood several years afterwards
when i had grown up to be a young man and i
found a knot gossips speculating on a skull
the haunted house 
which had just been turned up by a ploughshare

they course determined it to be the remains
 some one that had been murdered and
they had raked up with it some the traditionary
tales the haunted house i knew it at
once to be the relique poor pompey but i
held my tongue for i am too considerate 
other people's enjoyment ever to mar a story 
a ghost or a murder i took care however to
see the bones my old friend once more buried
in a place where they were not likely to be disturbed
as i sat on the turf and watched the
interment i fell into a long conversation with an
old gentleman the neighbourhood john fosse
windermere a pleasant gossiping man whose
whole life was spent in hearing and telling the
news the province he recollected old poi
pey and his stories about the haunted house 
but he assured me he could give me one still
more strange than any that pompey had related 
and on my expressing a great curiosity to hear it
he sat down beside me on the turf and told the
the haunted house
following tale i have endeavoured to give it as
nearly as possible in his words but it is now
many years since and i am grown old and my
memory is not over good cannot therefore
vouch for the language but i am always scrupulous
as to facts

in the early times the province newyork
while it groaned under the tyranny the
english governor lord carbury who carried
his cruelties toward the dutch inhabitants so jar
as to allow no dominie nor schoolmaster to oj
cite in their language without his special license
 about this time there lived in the jolly little
old city the manhattoes a kind motherly
dame known by the name dame heyliger
she was the widow a dutch sea captain
 adolph heyliger
who died suddenly a fever in consequence 
working too hard and eating too heartily at
the time when all the inhabitants turned out ina
panic to fortify the place against the invasion
 a small french privateer he left her with
very little money and one infant son the only
survivor several children the good woman
had need much management to make both
ends meet and keep up a decent appearance
however as her husband had fallen a victim to
his zeal for the public safety it was universally
agreed that something ought to be done for the
widow and on the hopes this something
she lived very tolerably for some years in the
mean time every body pitied and spoke well 
her and that helped along
she lived in a small house in a small street
called garden street very probably from a
garden which may have flourished there sometime
or other as her necessities every year
grew greater and the talk the public about
doing something for her grew less she had

adolph heyliger 
to cast about for some mode doing something
for herself by way helping out her slender
means and maintaining her independence 
which she was somewhat tenacious
living in a mercantile town she had caught
something the spirit and determined to venture
a little in the great lottery commerce
on a sudden therefore to the great surprise 
the street there appeared at her window a grand
array gingerbread kings and queens with
their arms stuck akimbo after the invariable
royal manner there were also several broken
tumblers some filled with sugar plumbs some
with marbles there were moreover cakes 
various kinds and barley sugar and holland
dolls and wooden horses with here and there
gilt covered picture books and now and then a
skein thread or a dangling pound candle
at the door the house sat the good old
dame's cat a decent demure looking personage
that seemed to scan every body that passed to
criticise their dress and now and then to stretch
her neck and look out with sudden curiosity to
adolph heyliger
see what was going on at the other the
street but if by chance any idle vagabond dog
came by and offered to be uncivil hoitytoity 
how she would bristle up and growl and spit
and strike out her paws she was as indignant
as ever was an ancient and ugly spinster on the
approach some graceless profligate
but though the good woman had to comedown
to those humble means subsistence yet
she still kept up a feeling family pride having
descended from the vanderspiegels amsterdam
 and she had the family arms painted
and framed and hung over her mantlepiece she
vas in truth much respected by all the poorer
people the place her house was quite a resort
 the old wives the neighbourhood they
would drop in there a winter's afternoon as
le sat knitting on one side her fireplace her
cat purring on the other and the teakettle singing
before it and they would gossip with her
until late in the evening there was always an
armchair for old peter de groodt sometimes
called long peter and sometimes peter longlegs
bolph heyliger 
the clerk and sexton the little lutheran
church who was her great crony and indeed
the oracle her fireside nay the dominie
himself did not disdain now and then to stop in
converse about the state her mind and take a
glass her especial good cherry brandy indeed
he never failed to call on new year's day
and wish her a happy new year and the good
dame who was a little vain on some points always
piqued herself on giving him as large a cake
as any one in town
i have said that she had one son he was
the child her old age butcould hardly be
called the comfort for all unlucky urchins
dolph heyliger was the most mischievous not
that the whisper was really vicious he was
only full fun and frolick and had that daring
gamesome spirit which is extolled in a rich man's
child but execrated in a poor man's he was
continually getting into scrapes his mother was
incessantly harassed with complaints some
waggish prank which he had played off bills
were sent in for windows that he had broken in
vol it 
s adolph heyligek
a word he had not reached his fourteenth year
before he was pronounced by all the neighbourhood
to be a wicked dog the wickedest dog
in the street nay one old gentleman in a
claret coloured coat with a thin red face and
ferret eyes went so far as to assure dame heytiger
that her son would one day or other come
to the gallows 
yet notwithstanding all this the poor old soul
loved her boy it seemed as though she loved
him the better the worse he behaved and that
he grew more in her favour the more he grew
out favour with the world mothers are
foolish fond hearted beings there's no reasoning
them out their dotage and indeed this
poor woman's child was all that was left to love
her in this world so w e must not think it hard
that she turned a deaf ear to her good friends
who sought to prove to her that dolph must inevitably
come to a halter to do the varlet justice
too he was strongly attached to his parent
he would not willingly have given her pain on
any account and when he had been doing wrong
adolph heyliger 
it was but foe him to catch his poor mother's eye
fixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him to fill
his heart with bitterness and contrition but he
was a heedless youngster and could not for the
life him resist any new temptation to fun and
mischief though quick at his learning whenever
he could be brought to apply himself yet he
was always prone to be led away by idle company
 and would play truant to hunt after bird's
nests to rob orchards or to swim in the hudson

in this way he grew up a tall lubberly boy
and his mother began to be greatly perplexed
what to do with him or how to put him in a
way to do for himself for he had acquired such
an unlucky reputation that no one seemed willing
to employ him many was the consultation
that she held with peter de groodt the clerk
and sexton who was her prime councillor
peter was as much perplexed as herself for he
had no great opinion the boy and thought he
would never come to good he at one time
advised her to send him to sea a piece advice
 adolph heyliger
only given in the most desperate cases but dame
heyliger would not listen to such an idea she
could not think letting dolph go out her
sight she was sitting one day knitting by her
fireside in great perplexity when the sexton
entered with an air unusual vivacity and briskness
he had just come from a funeral it had
been that a boy dolph's years who had
been apprentice to a famous german doctor
who had died a consumption it is true there
had been a whisper that the deceased had been
brought to his by being made the subject 
the doctor's experiments on which he was apt
to try the effects a new compound or a quieting
draught this however it is likely was a
mere scandal at any rate peter de groodt did
not think it worth mentioning though had we
time to philosophize it would be a curious matter
for speculation why a doctor's family is apt
to be so lean and cadaverous and a butcher's so
jolly and rubicund
peter de groodt as i said before entered the
house dame heyliger with unusual alacrity
adolph heyliger 
he was full a bright idea that had popped
into his head at the funeral and over which he
had chuckled as he shovelled the earth into the
grave the doctor's disciple it had occurred
to him thar as the situation the deceased was
vacant at the doctor's it would be the very
place for dolph the boy had parts and could
pound a pestle and run an errand with any boy in
the town and what more was wanted in a student

the suggestion the sage peter was a vision
 glory to the mother she already saw dolphin
her mind's eye with a cane at his nose a
knocker at his door and an m d at the 
 his name one the established dignitaries 
the town 
the matter once undertaken was soon effected
 the sexton had some influence with the
doctor they having had much dealing together
in the way their separate professions and
the very next morning he called and conducted
the urchin clad in his sunday clothes to undergo
 adolph heyliger
the inspection doctor karl lodovich knip
perhausen
they found the doctor seated in an elbow
chair in one corner his study or laboratory
with a large volume in german print before him
he was a short fat man with a dark square
lace rendered more dark by a black velvet cap
he had a little robbed nose not unlike the ace
 spades with a pair spectacles gleaming
on each side his dusky countenance like a
couple bow windows
dolph felt struck with awe on entering into
the presence this learned man and gazed
about him with boyish wonder at the furniture
 this chamber knowledge which appeared
to him almost as the den a magician in the
centre stood a claw footed table with pestle and
mortar phials and galli pots and a pair small
burnished scales at one was a heavy
clothes press turned into a receptacle for drugs
and compounds against which hung the doctor's
hat and cloak and goldheaded cane and on
the top grinned a human scull along the randolph
heyliger 
timepiece were glass vessels holding snakes and
lizards and a human foetus preserved in spirits
a closet the doors which were taken off
contained three whole shelves full books and
some too mighty folio dimensions a collection
the like which dolph had never before
beheld as however the library did not
take up the whole the closet the doctor's
thrifty housekeeper had occupied the rest with
pots pickles and preserves and had hung
about the room among awful implements the
healing art strings red peppers and corpulent
cucumbers carefully preserved for seed
peter de groodt and his protege were received
with great gravity and stateliness by the
doctor who was a very wise dignified little
man and never smiled he surveyed dolph
from head to foot above and under and through
his spectacles and the poor lad's heart quailed as
these great glasses glared on him like two full
moons the doctor heard all that peter de
groodt had to say in favour the youthful candidate
 and then wetting his thumb with the
 adolph belligerent
 his tongue he began deliberately to turnover
page after page the great black volume
before him at length after many hums and
haws and stroking the chin and all that hesitation
and deliberation with which a wise man
proceeds to do what he intended to do from the
very first the doctor agreed to take the lad as a
disciple to give him bed board and clothing
and to instruct him in the healing art in return
for which he was to have his services until his
twentyfirst year behold then our hero all at
once transformed from an unlucky urchin running
wild about the streets to a student medicine
diligently pounding a pestle under the auspices
 the learned doctor karl lodovich
knipperhauseri it was a happy transition for
his fond old mother she was delighted with
the idea her boy's being brought up worthy
 his ancestors and anticipated the day when
he would be able to hold up his head with the
lawyer that lived in the large door opposite or
peradventure with the dominie himself
adolph heyliger 
doctor knipperhausen was a native the palatinate
in germany from whence in company
with many his countrymen he had taken refuge
in england on account religious persecution
he was one nearly three thousand
palatines who came over from england in 
under the protection governor hunter where
the doctor had studied how he had acquired
his medical knowledge and where he had received
his diploma it is hard at present to say
for nobody knew at the time yet it is certain
that his profound skill and abstruse knowledge
were the talk and wonder the common people
far and near his practice was totally different
from that any other physician consisting
in mysterious compounds known only to himself
in the preparing and administering 
which it was said he always consulted the stars
so high an opinion was entertained his skill
particularly by the german and dutch inhabitants
that they always resorted to him in desperate
cases he was one those infallible doctors
that are always effecting sudden and surprise
 
 adolph heyliger
sing cures when the patient has been given up
by all the regular physicians unless as is
shrewdly observed the case has been left too
long before it was put into his hands the
doctor's library was the talk and marvel the
neighbourhood i might almost say the entire
burgh the good people looked with reverence
at a man that had read three whole shelves full
 books and some them too as large as a
family bible there were many disputes among
the members the little lutheran church as
to which was the wisest man the doctor or the
dominie some his admirers even went so far
as to say that he knew more than the governor
himself in a word it was thought that there
was no to his knowledge 
no sooner was dolph received into the doctor's
family than he was put in possession the
lodgings his predecessor it was a garret
room a steep roofed dutch house where the
rain pattered on the shingles and the lightning
gleamed arid the wind piped through the crannies
in stormy weather and where whole troops
adolph heyligeiu 
 hungry rats galloped about like don cossacks
in defiance traps and ratsbane
he was soon up to his ears in medical studies
being employed morning noon and night in
rolling pills filtering tinctures or pounding the
pestle and mortar in one corner the laboratory
 while the doctor would take his seat in
another corner when he had nothing else to door
expected visitors and arrayed in his morning
gown and velvet cap would pore over the contents
 some folio volume it is true that the
regular thumping dolph's pestle or perhaps
the drowsy buzzing the summer flies would
now and then lull the little man into a slumber 
but then his spectacles were always wide awake
and studiously regarding the 
there was another personage in the house
however to whom dolph was obliged to pay
allegiance though a bachelor and a man 
such great dignity and importance yet the doctor
was like many other wise men subject to
petticoat goverment he was completely under
the sway his housekeeper a spare busy
 adolph heyliger
fretting housewife in a little round quilted
german cap with a huge bunch keys jingling
at the girdle an exceedingly long waist
fran use or frow ilsyy as it was pronounced
had accompanied him in his various migrations
from germany to england and from england
to the province managing his establishment
and himself too ruling him it is true with a
gentle hand but carrying a high hand with all
the world beside how she had acquired such
ascendancy i do not pretend to say people
it is true did talk but have not people been
prone to talk ever since the world began who
can tell how women generally contrive to get
the upper hand a husband it is true may
now and then be master in his own house but
who ever knew a bachelor that was not managed
by his housekeeper 
indeed frau ilsyy's power was not confined
to the doctor's household she was one 
those prying gossips that know every one's business
better than they do themselves and
whose allseeing eyes and alltelling tongues
adolph heyliger 
are terrors throughout a neighbourhood nothing
 any moment transpired m the world 
scandal this little burgh but it was kiiown
to frau ilsyy she had her crew cronies
that were perpetually hurrying to her little parlour
with some precious bit news nay she
would sometimes discuss a whole volume secret
history as she held the street door ajar and
gossiped with one those garrulous crones
in the very teeth a december blast
between the doctor and the housekeeper it
may easily be supposed that dolph had a busy
life it as frau f isy kept the keys and literally
ruled the roast it was starvation to offend
her though he found the study her temper
more perplexing even than that medicine
when not busy in the laboratory she kept him
running hither and thither on her own errands 
and on sundays he was obliged to accompany
her to and from church and carry her bible and
many a time has the poor varlet stood shivering
and blowing his fingers or holding his frostbit
ten nose in the church yard while frau ilsyy
 adolph heyliger
and her cronies were huddled together wagging
their heads and tearing some unlucky character
to pieces
with allhis advantages however dolph made
but very slow progress in his art this was no
fault the doctor's certainly for he took unwearied
pains with the lad keeping him close
to the pestle and mortar or on the trot about
town with phials and pillboxes and if he ever
flagged in his industry which he was rather apt
to do the doctor would fly into a passion and
ask him if he ever expected to learn his profession
unless he applied himself closer to the study
the fact is he still retained the fondness for
sport and mischief that had marked his childhood
the habit indeed strengthened with his
years and gained force from being thwarted and
constrained he daily grew more and more untractable
 and lost favour in the eyes both the
doctor and the housekeeper
in the mean time the doctor went on waxing
wealthy and renowned he was famous for his
skill in managing cases not laid down in the
adolph heyliger 
books he had cured several old women and
young girls witchcraft a terrible complaint
nearly as prevalent in the province in those days
as hydrophobia is at present he had even restored
one strapping country girl to perfect health
who had gone so far as to vomit crooked pins
and needles which is considered a desperate
stage the malady it was whispered also
that he was possessed the art preparing
love ponders and many applications had he inconsequence
from lovesick patients both
sexes but all these cases formed the mysterious
part his practice in which according to the
cant phrase secrecy and honour might be
depended on dolph therefore was obliged to
turn out the study when such consultations
occurred though it is said he learnt more the
secrets the art at the key hole than by all the
rest his studies put together
as the doctor increased in wealth he began to
extend his possessions and to look forward like
other great men to the time when he should retire
to the repose a country seat for this
adolph heyligek
purpose he had purchased a farm or as the
dutch settlers called it a bower a few miles
from town it had been the residence a wealthy
family that had returned some time since to
holland a large mansion house stood in the
centre it very much out repair and which
in consequence certain reports had received
the appellation the haunted house either
from these reports or from its actual dreariness
the doctor had found it impossible to get a tenant
and that the place might not fall to ruin
before he could reside in it himself he had placed
a country boor with his family in one wing
with the privilege cultivating the farm on
shares
the doctor now felt all the dignity a landholder
rising within him he had a little the
german pride territory in his composition
and almost looked upon himself as owner a
principality he began to complain the fatigue
 business and was fond riding out
to look at his estate his little expeditions
to his lands were attended with a bustle and paadolph
heyliger 
rade that created a sensation throughout the
neighbourhood his walleyed horse stood stamping
and whisking off the flies for a full hour before
the house then the doctor's saddle bags
would be brought out and adjusted then after
a little while his cloak would be rolled up and
strapped to the saddle then his umbrella would
be buckled to the cloak while in the meantime
a group ragged boys that observant
class beings would gather before the door
at length the doctor would issue forth in a pair
 jack boots that reached above his knees and
a cocked hat flapped down in front as he was
a short fat man he took some time to mount
into the saddle and when there he took sometime
to have the saddle and stirrups properly
adjusted enjoying the wonder and admiration
 the urchin crowd even after he had set
off he would pause in the middle the street
or trot back two or three times to give some
parting orders which were answered by the
housekeeper from the door or dolph from the
study or the black cook from the cellar or the
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
chambermaid from the garret window and
there were generally some last words bawled
after him just as he was turning the corner
the whole neighbourhood would be aroused
by this pomp and circumstance the cobbler
would leave his last the barber would thrust
out his frizzed head with a comb sticking in ita
knot would collect at the grocer's door and
the word would be buzzed from one the
street to the other the doctor's riding out to
his country seat 
these were golden moments for dolph no
sooner was the doctor out sight than pestle
and mortar were abandoned the laboratory was
left to take care itself and the student was
off on some madcap frolick indeed it must be
confessed the youngster as he grew up seemed
in a fair way to fulfil the prediction the old
claret coloured gentleman he was the ringleader
 all holyday sports and midnight gambols
 ready for all kinds mischievous pranks
and harebrained adventure there is nothing
so troublesome as a hero on a small scale or
oolph heyliger 
rather a hero in a small town dolph soon became
the abhorrence all drowsy housekeeping
old citizens who hated noise and had no relish
for waggery the good dames too considered
him as little better than a reprobate 
gathered their daughters under their wings
whenever he approached and pointed him out
as a warning to their sons no one seemed to
hold him in much regard excepting the wild
striplings the place who were captivated by
his openhearted daring manners and the negroes
who always look upon every idle dono
thing youngster as a kind gentleman even
the good peter de groodt who had considered
himself a kind patron the lad began to
despair him and would shake his head dubiously
as he listened to a long complaint the
housekeeper's and sipped a glass her raspberry
brandy
still his mother was not to be wearied out
 her affection by all the waywardness her
boy nor disheartened by the stories his misdeeds
with which her good friends were 
adolph heyliger
annually regaling her she had it is true very
little the pleasure which rich people enjoy
in always hearing their children praised but
she considered all this ill will as a kind persecution
which he suffered and she liked him
the better on that account she saw him growing
up a fine tall good looking youngster and
she looked at him with the secret pride a mother's
heart it was her great desire that dolph
should appear like a gentleman and all the money
she could save went towards helping out
his pocket and his wardrobe she would lookout
 the window after him as he sallied forth
in his best and her heart would yearn with delight
 and once when peter de groodt struck
with the youngster's gallant appearance on a
bright sunday morning observed well after
all dolph does grow a comely fellow the
tear pride started into the mother's eye ah
neighbour neighbour exclaimed she they
may say what they please poor dolph will yet
hold up his head with the best them 
dolph heyliger had now nearly attained his
adolph heyliger 
oneandtwentieth year and the term his
medical studies was just expiring yet it must
be confessed that he knew little more the profession
than when he first entered the doctor's
doors this however could not be from any
want quickness parts for he showed amazing
aptness in mastering other branches 
knowledge which he could only have studied at
intervals he was for instance a sure marksman
and won all the geese and turkeys at christmas
holidays he was a bold rider he was
famous for leaping and wrestling he played tolerably
on the fiddle could swim like a fish
and was the best hand in the whole place at
fives and ninepins
all these accomplishments however procured
him no favour in the eyes the doctor who
grew more and more crabbed and intolerant the
nearer the term apprenticeship approached
frau ilsyy too was forever finding some occasion
to raise a windy tempest about his ears 
and seldom encountered him about the house
without a clatter the tongue so that at length
 adolph heyliger
the jingling her keys as she approached was
to dolph like the ringing the prompter's bell
that gives notice a theatrical thunder storm
nothing but the infinite good humour the
heedless youngster enabled him to bear all this
domestic tyranny without open rebellion it
was evident that the doctor and his housekeeper
were preparing to beat the poor youth out the
nest the moment his term should have expired 
a shorthand mode which the doctor had providing
for useless disciples
indeed the little man had been rendered more
than usually irritable lately in consequence 
various cares and vexations which his country
estate had brought upon him the doctor had
been repeatedly annoyed by the rumours and
tales which prevailed concerning the old mansion
and found it difficult to prevail even upon
the countryman and his family to remain there
rent free every time he rode out to the farm
he was teased by some fresh complaint strange
noises and fearful sights with which the tenants
were disturbed at night and the doctor would
adolph meyliger 
come home fretting arid fuming and vent his
spleen upon the whole household it was indeed
a sore grievance that affected him both in
pride and purse he was threatened with an
absolute loss the profits his property and
then what a blow to his territorial consequence
to be the landlord a haunted house it was
observed however that with all his vexation
the doctor never proposed to sleep in the house
himself nay he could never be prevailed upon
to remain on the premises after dark but made
the best his way for town as soon as the bats
began to flit about in the twilight the fact
was the doctor was a secret believer in ghosts
having passed the early part his life in a country
where they particularly abound and indeed
the story went that when a boy he had
once seen the devil upon the harts mountains
in germany
at length the doctor's vexations on this head
were brought to a crisis one morning as he
sat dozing over a volume in his study he was
 adolph heyliger
suddenly startled from his slumbers by the bustling
in the housekeeper
here's a fine todo cried she as she entered
the room here's claus hopper come
in bag and baggage from the farm and swears
he'll have nothing more to do with it the
whole family have been frightened out their
wits for there's such racketing and rummaging
about the old house that they can't sleep quiet
in their beds
donner und bitten cried the doctor
impatiently will they never have done chattering
about that house what a pack fools
to let a few hungry rats and mice frighten them
out good quarters
nay nay said the housekeeper wagging
her head knowingly and piqued at having a
good ghost story doubted there's more in it
than rats and mice all the neighbourhood talks
about the house and then such sights have
been seen in it peter de groodt tells me that
the family that sold you the house and went to
holland dropped several strange hints about it
adolph heyliger 
and said they wished you joy your bargain 
and you know yourself there's no getting any
family to live in it
peter de groodt's a ninny an old woman
said the doctor peevishly i'll warrant he's
been filling these people's heads full stories
it's just like his nonsense about the ghost that
haunted the church belfry as an excuse for not
ringing the bell that cold night when germanus
brinkerhoff's house was on fire send clans
to me
claus hopper now made his appearance a
simple country lout full awe at finding himself
in the very study dr knipperhausen and
too much embarrassed to enter into much detail
 the matters that had caused his alarm he
stood twirling his hat in one hand resting sometimes
on one leg sometimes on the other looking
occasionally at the doctor and now and then
stealing a fearful glance at the death's head that
seemed ogling him from the top the clothes
press
the doctor tried every means to persuade him
vol 
 adolph heyliger
to return to the farm but all in vain he maintained
a dogged determination on the subject 
and at the close every argument or solicitation
would make the same brief inflexible reply
ici kan night mynheer
the doctor was a little pot and soon hot
his patience was exhausted by these continual
vexations about his estate the stubborn refusal
 claus hopper seemed to him like flat
rebellion his temper suddenly boiled over and
claus was glad to make a rapid retreat to escape
scalding
when the bumpkin got to the housekeeper's
room he found peter de groodt and several other
true believers ready to receive him here he
indemnified himself for the restraint he had
suffered in the study and opened a budget 
stories about the haunted house that astonished
all his hearers the housekeeper believed them
all if it was only to spite the doctor for having
received her intelligence so uncourteous peter
de groodt matched them with many a wonderful
legend the times the dutch dynasty and
adolph heyliger 
 the devil's stepping stones and the pirate
that was hanged at gibbet island and continued
to swing there at night long after the gallows
was taken down and the ghost the unfortunate
german lesser who was hanged for
treason which haunted the old fort and the government
house the gossiping knot dispersed
each charged with direful intelligence the
sexton disburdened himself at a vestry meeting
that was held that very day and the black
cook forsook her kitchen and spent half the
day at the street pump that gossiping place 
servants dealing forth the news to all that came
for water in a little while the whole town was
in a buzz with tales about the haunted house
some said that claus hopper had seen the
devil while others hinted that the house was
haunted by the ghosts some the patients
which the doctor had physicked out the
world and that was the reason why he did not
venture to live in it himself
all this put the little doctor in a terrible fume
he threatened vengeance on any one who
 adolph heyliger
should affect the value his property by exciting
popular prejudices he complained loud
 thus being in a manner dispossessed his
territories by mere bugbears but he secretly
determined to have the house exorcised by the
dominie
great was his relief therefore when in the
midst his perplexities dolph stepped forward
and undertook to garrison the haunted house
the youngster had been listening to all the stones
 claus hopper and peter de groodt he
was fond adventure he loved the marvellous
 and his imagination had become quite excited
by these tales wonder besides he had
led such an uncomfortable life at the doctor's
being subjected to the intolerable thraldom 
early hours that he was delighted at the prospect
 having a house to himself even though it
should be a haunted one his offer was eagerly
accepted and it was determined that he should
mount guard that very night his only stipulation
was that the enterprize should be kept secret
from his mother for he knew the poor soul
adolph heyliger 
would not sleep a wink if she knew that her son
was waging war with the powers darkness
when night came on he set out on this perilous
expedition the old black cook his only
friend in the household had provided him with
a little mess for supper and a rush light and
she tied round his neck an amulet given herby
an african conjuror as a charm against evil
spirits dolph was escorted on his way by the
doctor and peter de groodt who had agreed to
accompany him to the house and to see him safe
lodged
the night was overcast and it was very dark
when they arrived at the grounds which surrounded
the mansion the sexton led the way
with a lanthorn as they walked along the avenue
 acacias the fitful light catching from
bush to bush and tree to tree often startled the
doughty peter and made him fall back upon his
followers and the doctor grappled still closer
hold dolph's arm observing that the ground
was very slippery and uneven at one time they
were nearly put to total rout by a bat which
c adolph heyliger
came flitting about the lanthorn and the notes
 the insects from the trees and the frogs from
a neighbouring pond formed a most drowsy and
doleful concert
the front door the mansion opened with a
grating sound that made the doctor turn pale
they entered a tolerably large hall such as is
common in american country houses to serve
for sitting rooms in warm weather from hence
they went up a wide staircase that groaned and
creaked as they trod every step making its particular
note like the key a harpsichord this
led to another hall on the second story from
whence they entered the room where dolph was
to sleep it was large and scantily furnished
the shutters were closed but as they were
much shattered there was not want a circulation
 air it appeared to have been that sacred
chamber known among dutch housewives
by the name the best bed room which is
the best furnished but in which scarce any body
is ever permitted to sleep its splendour however
was all at an a few broken articles
adolph heyliger 
 furniture were about the walls and in the
centre the room was a heavy deal table and
a large arm chair both which had the look 
being coeval with the mansion the fireplace
was wide and had been faced with dutch tiles
representing scripture stories but several 
them had fallen out their places and lay shattered
about the hearth
the sexton had lit the rush light and the doctor
looking fearfully about the room was just
exhorting dolph to be good cheer and to
pluck up a stout heart when a noise in the chimney
like voices and struggling struck a sudden
panic into the sexton he took to his
heels with the lanthorn the doctor followed
hard after him the stairs groaned and whistled
as they hurried down increasing their agitation
and speed by its noises the front door slammed
after them and dolph heard them scrambling
down the avenue till the sound their feet
was lost in the distance that he did not join in
this precipitate retreat might have been owing
to his possessing a little more courage than his
 adolph heylger
companions or perhaps that he had caught a
glimpse the cause their dismay in a nest
 chimney swallows that came tumbling down
into the fireplace
being now left to himself he secured the front
door by a strong bolt and bar and having seen
that the other entrances were fastened he returned
to his desolate chamber having made his
supper from the basket which the good old cook
had provided he locked the chamber door and
retired to rest on a mattress in one corner the
night was calm and still and nothing broke
upon the profound quiet but the lonely chirping
 a cricket from the chimney a distant chamber
the rush light which stood in the centre
 the deal table shed a feeble yellow ray dimly
illumining the chamber and making uncouth
shapes and shadows on the walls from the clothes
which dolph had thrown over a chair
with all his boldness heart there was something
subduing in this desolate scene and he
felt his spirits flag within him as he lay on his
hard bed and gazed about the room he was
adolph heyligeh 
turning over in his mind his idle habits his
doubtful prospects and now and then heaving
a heavy sigh as he thought on his poor old mother
 for there is nothing like the silence and
loneliness night to bring dark shadows over
the brightest mind by and bye he thought he
heard a sound as if some one was walking below
stairs he listened and distinctly heard a step
on the great staircase it approached solemnly
and slowly tramp tramp tramp it was
evidently the tread some heavy personage 
and yet how could he have got into the house
without making a noise he had examined all
the fastenings and was certain that every entrance
was secured still the steps advanced
tramp tramp tramp it was evident that
the person approaching could not be a robber 
the step was too loud and deliberate a robber's
would be either stealthy or precipitate and
now the footsteps had ascended the staircase 
they were slowly advancing along the passage
resounding through the silent and empty apartments
the very cricket had ceased its means
 
 adolph heyliger
holy note and nothing interrupted their awful
distinctness the door which had been locked
on the inside slowly swung open as if self moved
the footsteps entered the room but no one
was to be seen they passed slowly and audibly
across it tramp tramp tramp but whatever
made the sound was invisible dolph rubbed
his eves and stared about him he could see
to every part the dimly lighted chamber all
was vacant yet still he heard these mysterious
footsteps solemnly walking about the chamber
they ceased and all was dead silence there
was something more appalling in this invisible
visitation than there would have been in anything
that addressed itself to the eyesight it
was awfully vague and indefinite he felt his
heart beat hard against his ribs a cold sweat
broke out upon his forehead he lay for sometime
in a state violent agitation nothing
however occurred to increase his alarm his
light gradually burnt down into the socket and
he felt asleep when he awoke it was broad
daylight the sun was peering through the
adolph heyliqer
cracks the window shutters and the birds
were merrily singing about the house the
bright cheery day soon put to flight all the terrors
 the preceding night dolph laughed or
rather tried to laugh at all that had passed and
endeavoured to persuade himself that it was a
mere freak the imagination conjured up by
the stories he had heard but he was a little
puzzled to find the door his room locked on
the inside notwithstanding that he had positively
seen it swing open as the footsteps entered
he returned to town in a state considerable
perplexity but he determined to say nothing on
the subject until his doubts were either confirmed
or removed by another night's watching
his silence was a grievous disappointment to the
gossips who had gathered at the doctor's mansion
they had prepared their minds to hear
direful tales and they were almost in a rage at
being assured that he had nothing to relate
the next night then dolph repeated his
vigil he now entered the house with some
trepidation he was particular in examining
 adolph heyligek
the fastenings all the doors and securing
them well he locked the door his chamber
and placed a chair upon it then having
despatched his supper he threw himself on his
mattress and endeavoured to sleep it was all
in vain a thousand crowding fancies kept him
waking the time slowly dragged on as if
minutes were spinning themselves out into
hours as the night advanced he grew more
and more nervous and he almost started from
his couch when he heard the mysterious footstep
again on the staircase up it came as
before solemnly and slowly tramp tramp
tramp it approached along the passage the
door again swung open as if there had been
neither lock nor impediment and a strange
looking figure stalked into the room it w as
an elderly man large and robust clothed in the
old flemish fashion he had on a kind short
cloak with a garment under it belted round
the waist a pair russet boots very large
at top and standing widely from his legs he
had trunk hose with great bunches at the
bolph heyliger 
knees his hat was broad and slouched with
a feather trailing over one side his irongray
hair hung in thick masses in his neck and he
had a short grizzled beard he walked slowly
round the room as if examining that all was
safe then hanging his hat on a peg beside the
door he sat down in the elbow chair and leaning
his elbow on the table fixed his eyes on
dolph with an unmoving and deadening stare
dolph was not naturally a coward but he
had been brought up in an implicit belief in
ghosts and goblins a thousand stories came
swarming to his mind that he had heard about
this building and as he looked at this strange personage
with his uncouth garb his pale visage
his grizzly beard and his fixed staring fishlike
eye his teeth began to chatter his hair to rise
on his head and a cold sweat to break out allover
his body how long he remained in this
situation he could not tell for he was like one
fascinated he could not take his gaze off
from the spectre but lay staring at him with
his whole intellect absorbed in the contemplated
adolph heyliger
tion the old man remained seated behind the
table without stirring or turning an eye always
keeping a dead stead glare upon dolph
at length the household cock from a neighbouring
farm clapped his wings and gave a loud
cheerful crow that rung over the fields at the
sound the old man slowly rose and took down
his hat from the peg the door opened and
closed after him he was heard to go slowly
down the staircase tramp tramp tramp and
when he had got to the bottom all was again
silent dolph lay and listened earnestly counted
every foot fall listened and listened if the steps
should return until exhausted with watching
and agitation he fell into a troubled sleep
daylight again brought fresh courage and assurance
he would fain have considered all that
had passed as a mere dream yet there stood
the chair in which the unknown had seated himself
 there was the table on which he had leaned
 there was the peg on w r which he had hung his
hat and there was the door locked precisely ashe
himself locked it with the chair placed against
adolph heyliger 
it he hastened down stairs and examined the
doors and windows all were exactly in the same
state in which he had left them and there was
no apparent way by which any being could have
entered and left the house without leaving some
trace behind pooh said dolph to himself
it was all a dream but it would not do the
more he endeavoured to shake the scene off from
his mind the more it haunted him
though he persisted in a strict silence as to
all that he had seen and heard yet his looks betrayed
the uncomfortable night that he had passed
it was evident there was something wonderful
hidden under this mysterious reserve the
doctor took him into the study locked the door
and sought to have a full and confidential communication
 but he could get nothing out him
frau use took him aside into the pantry but to
as little purpose and peter de groodt held him
by the button for a full hour in the churchyard
the very place to get at the bottom a ghost
story but came off not a whit wiser than the
rest it is always the case however that one
 adolph heyligkk
truth concealed makes a dozen current lies it
is like a guinea locked up in a bank that has a
dozen paper representatives before the day
was over the neighbourhood was full reports
some said that dolph heyliger watched in the
haunted house with pistols loaded with silver
bullets others that he had had a long talk with a
spectre without a head others that doctor
knipperhausen and the sexton had been hunted
down the bowerylane and quite into town by
a legion ghosts their old customers some
shook their heads and thought it a shame that
the doctor should put dolph to pass the night
alone in that dismal house where he might be
spirited away no one knew whither while others
observed with a shrug that if the devil did carry
off the youngster it would but be taking his
own
these rumours at length reached the ears 
the good dame heyliger and as may be supposed
threw her into a terrible alarm for her
son to have exposed himself to dangers from living
foes would have been nothing so dreadful
adolph heylfger 
in her eyes as to dare alone the terrors the
haunted house she hastened goethe doctor's
and passed a great part the day in attempting
to dissuade dolph from repeating his vigil she
told him a score tales which her gossiping
friends had just related to her persons who
had been carried off when watching alone in old
ruinous houses it was all to no effect dolph's
pride as well as curiosity was piqued he endeavoured
to calm the apprehensions his mother
and to assure her that there was no truth
in all the rumours she had heard she looked
at him dubiously and shook her head but finding
his determination was not to be shaken she
brought him a little thick dutch bible with brass
clasps to take with him as a sword wherewith
to fight the powers darkness and lest that
might not be sufficient the housekeeper gave him
the heidelberg catechism by way dagger
the next night therefore dolph took up his
quarters for the third time in the old mansion
whether dream or not the same thing was repeated
towards midnight when every thing
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
was still the same sound echoed through the
empty halls tramp tramp tramp the stairs
were again ascended the door again swung
open the old man entered walked round the
room hung up his hat and seated himself by
the table the same fear and trembling came
over poor dolph though not in so violent a degree
he lay in the same way motionless and
fascinated staring at the figure which regarded
him as before with a dead fixed chilling
gaze in this way they remained for a longtime
till by degrees dolph's courage began gradually
to revive whether alive or dead this
being had certainly some object in his visitation
and he recollected to have heard it said that
spirits have no power to speak until they are
spoken to summoning up resolution therefore
and making two or three attempts before he
could get his parched tongue in motion he addressed
the unknown in the most solemn form
 adjuration that he could recollect and demanded
to know what was the motive his
visit
adolph heylifier 
no sooner had he finished than the old man
rose and took down his hat the door opened and
he went out looking back upon dolph just ashe
crossed the threshold as if expecting him to
follow the youngster did not hesitate an instant
he took the candle in his hand and the
bible under his arm and obeyed the tacit invitation
the candle emitted a feeble uncertain
ray but still he could see the figure before him
slowly descending the stairs he followed trembling
when it had reached the bottom the
stairs it turned through the hall towards the back
door the mansion dolph held the light over
balustrades but in his eagerness to catch a sight
 the unknown he flared his feeble taper so
suddenly that it went out still there was
sufficient light from the pale moon beams that
fell through a narrow window to give him an
indistinct view the figure near the door he
followed therefore down stairs and turned
towards the place but when he got there
the unknown had disappeared the door remained
fast barred and bolted there was no
 adolph heyliger
other mode exit yet the being whatever he
might be was gone he unfastened the door
and looked out into the fields it was a hazy
moonlight night so that the eye could distinguish
objects at some distance he thought he
saw the unknown in a footpath that led from
the door he was not mistaken but how had
he got out the house he did not pause to
think but followed on the old man proceeded
at a measured pace without looking about him
his footsteps sounding on the hard ground he
passed through the orchard apple trees that
stood near the house always keeping to the footpath
it led to a well situated in a little hollow
which had supplied the farm with water just
at this well dolph lost sight him he rubbed
his eyes and looked again but nothing was
to be seen the unknown he reached the
well but nobody was there all the surrounding
ground was open and clear there was no
bush nor hiding place he looked down the
well and saw at a great depth the reflection 
the sky in the still water after remaining here
adolph heyliger 
for some time without seeing or hearing anything
more his mysterious conductor hereturned
to the house full awe and wonder
he bolted the door groped his way back to
bed and it was long before he could compose
himself to sleep
his dreams were strange and troubled he
thought he was following the old man along the
side a great river until they came to a vessel
that was on the point sailing and that his
conductor led him on board arid vanished he
remembered the commander the vessel a short
swarthy man with cried black hair blind 
one eye and lame one leg but the rest his
dream was very confused sometimes he wassailing
sometimes on shore now amidst storms
and tempests and now wandering quietly in unknown
streets the figure the unknown was
strangely mingled up with the incidents the
dream and the whole distinctly wound up by
his finding himself on board the vessel again
returning home with a great bag money 
 adolph heyliger
when he woke the gray cool light dawn
was streaking the horizon and the cocks passing
the rcveil from farm to farm throughout the
country he rose more harassed and perplexed
than ever he was singularly confounded by
all that he had seen and dreamt and began to
doubt whether his mind was not affected and
whether all that was passing in his thoughts
might not be mere feverish fantasy in his present
state mind he did not feel disposed to
return immediately to the doctor's and undergo
the crossquestioning the household he
made a scanty breakfast therefore on the remains
 his last night's provisions and then
wandered out into the fields to meditate on all
that had befallen him lost in thought he rambled
about gradually approaching the town until
the morning was far advanced when he was
roused by a hurry and bustle around him he
found himself near the water's edge in a throng
 people hurrying to a pier where there was a
vessel ready to make sail he was unconsciously
carried along by the impulse the crowd and
adolph heyliger 
found that it was a sloop on the point sailing
up the hudson to albany there was much
leavetaking and kissing old women and
children and great activity in carrying on board
baskets bread and cakes and provisions all
kinds notwithstanding the mighty joints 
meat that dangled over the stern for a voyage
to albany was an expedition great moment
in those days the commander the sloop
was hurrying about and giving a world orders
which were not very strictly attended to 
one man being busy in lighting his pipe and another
in sharpening his snickersee
the appearance the commander suddenly
caught dolph's attention he was short and swarthy
with cried black hair blind one eye
and lame one leg the very commander that
he had seen in his dream surprized and aroused
he considered the scene more attentively and
recalled still further traces his dream the
appearance the vessel the river and a
a variety other objects accorded with the imperfect
images vaguely rising to recollection
 adolph heyliger
as he stood musing on these circumstances
the captain suddenly called to him in dutch
step on board young man or you'll be left
behind he was startled by the summons
he saw that the sloop was cast loose and was
actually moving from the pier it seemed as if he
was actuated by some irresistible impulse he
sprung upon the deck and the next moment the
sloop was hurried off by the wind and tide
dolph's thoughts and feelings were all in tumult
and confusion he had been strongly
worked upon by the events that had recently
befallen him and could not but think that there
was some connexion between his present situation
and his last night's dream he felt as if he
was under supernatural influence and he tried
to assure himself with an old and favourite maxim
 his that one way or other all would turnout
for the best for a moment the indignation
 the doctor at his departure without leave
passed across his mind but that was a matter 
little moment then he thought the distress 
his mother at his strange disappearance and the
adolph heyliger 
idea gave him a sudden pang he would have
intreated to he put on shore but he knew with
such wind and tide the entreaty would have been
in vain then the inspiring love novelty and
adventure nine rushing in full tide through his
bosom he felt himself launched strangely and
suddenly on the world and under full way to explore
the regions wonder that lay up this mighty
river and beyond those blue mountains that had
bounded his horizon since childhood while he
was lost in this whirl thought the sails strained
to the freeze the shores seemed to hurry away
behind him and before he perfectly recovered
his selfpossession the sloop was ploughing her
way past spiking devil and yonkers and the
tallest chimney the manhattoes had faded
from his sight
i have said that a voyage up the hudson in
those days was an undertaking some moment
 indeed it was as much thought as a
voyage to europe is at present the sloops
were often many days on the way the cautious
navigators taking in sail when it blew fresh and
vol 
 adolph heyligek
coming to anchor at night and stopping to send
the boat ashore for milk for tea without which
it w r as impossible for the worthy old lady passengers
to subsist and then there were the
much talked perils the tappaan zee and
the highlands in short a prudent dutch burgher
would talk such a voyage for months and
even years before hand and never undertook
it without putting his affairs in order making
his will and having prayers said for him in the
low dutch churches
in the course such a voyage therefore
dolph was satisfied he would have time enough
to reflect and to make up his mind what he
should do when he arrived at albany the captain
with his blind eye and lame leg would it is
true bring his strange dream to mind and perplex
him sadly for a few moments but late his
life had been made up so much dreams arid
realities his nights and days had been so jumbled
together that he seemed to be moving continually
in a delusion there is always however
a kind vagabond consolation in a man's
adolph heyliger 
having nothing in this world to lose with this
dolph comforted his heart and determined
to make the most the present enjoyment
in the second day their voyage they came
to the highlands it was the latter part a
calm sultry day that they floated gently with
the tide between these stern mountains there
was that perfect quiet which prevails over nature
in the languor summer heat the turning
 a plank or the accidental falling an
oar on deck was echoed from the mountain side
and reverberated along the shores and if by
chance the captain gave a shout command
there were airy tongues that mocked it from
every cliff
dolph gazed about him in mute delight and
wonder at these scenes nature's magnificence
to the left the dunderberg heaved its woody
precipices height over height forest over forest
away into the deep summer sky to the right
strutted forth the bold promontory anthony's
nose with a solitary eagle wheeling about it 
while beyond mountain succeeded to mountain
 adolph heyliger
until they seemed to lock their arms together
and confine this mighty river in their embraces
there was a feeling quiet luxury in gazing
at the broad green bosoms here and there scooped
out among the precipices or at woodlands
high in air nodding over the edge some beetling
bluff and all transparent in the yellow
sunshine
in the midst his admiration dolph remarked
a pile bright snowy clouds peering above
the western heights it was succeeded by
another and another each seemingly pushing
onwards its predecessor and towering with dazzling
brilliancy in the deep blue atmosphere
and now muttering peals thunder were faintly
heard rolling behind the mountains the river
hitherto still and glassy reflecting pictures 
the sky and land now showed a dark ripple
at a distance as the breeze came creeping up it
the fish hawks wheeled and screamed and
sought their nests on the high dry trees the
crows flew clamorously to the crevices the
adolph heyliger 
rocks and all nature seemed conscious the approaching
thunder gust
the clouds now rolled in volumes over the
mountain tops their summits still bright and
snowy but the lower parts an inky blackness
the rain began to patter down in broad
and scattered drops the wind freshened and
curled up the waves at length it seemed as if
the bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain
tops and complete torrents rain came
rattling down the lightning leaped from cloud
to cloud and streamed quivering against the
rocks splitting and rending the stoutest forest
trees the thunder burst in tremendous explosions
 the peals were echoed from mountain to
mountain they crashed upon dunderberg and
then rolled up the long defile the highlands
each headland making a new echo until old
bull hill seemed to bellow back the storm
for a time the scudding rack and mist and
the sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from
the sight there was a fearful gloom illumined
still more fearfully by the streams lightning
 adolph heyliger
which glittered among the rain drops never
had dolph beheld such an absolute warring 
the elements it seemed as if the storm was
tearing and rending its way through this mountain
defile and had brought all the artillery 
heaven into action
the vessel was hurried on by the increasing
wind until she came to where the river makes
a sudden bend the only one in the whole course
 its majestic career just as they turned the
point a violent flaw wind came sweeping down
a mountain gully bending the forest before it
and in a moment lashing up the river into white
froth and foam the captain saw the danger
and cried out to lower the sail before the order
could be obeyed the flaw struck the sloop and
threw her on her beam ends every thing now
was fright and confusion the flapping the
sails the whistling and rushing the wind 
the bawling the captain and crew the shrieking
 the passengers all mingled with the rollthis
must have been the bend at west point
adolph heyliger 
ing and bellowing the thunder in the midst
 the uproar the sloop righted at the same
time the mainsail shifted the boom came sweeping
the quarterdeck and dolph who was gazing
unguardedly at the clouds found himself ina
moment floundering in the river
for once in his life one his idle accomplishments
was use to him the many truant
hours which he had devoted to sporting in the
hudson had made him an expert swimmer 
yet with all his strength and skill he found
great difficulty in reaching the shore his disappearance
from the deck had not been noticed
by the crew who were all occupied with their
own danger the sloop was driven along with
inconceivable rapidity she had hard work to
weather a long promontory on the eastern shore
round which the river turned and which completely
shut her from dolph's view
it was on a point the western shore that
he landed and scrambling up the rocks he
threw himself faint and exhausted at the foot
 a tree by degrees the thunder gust passed
 adolph heyliger
over the clouds rolled away to the east
where they lay piled in feathery masses tinted
with the last rosy rays the sun the distant
play the lightning might be still seen about
their dark bases and now and then might be
heard the faint muttering the thunder
dolph rose and sought about to see if any path
led from the shore but all was savage and
trackless the rocks were piled upon each
other great trunks trees lay shattered about
as they had been blown down by the strong
winds which draw through these mountains or
had fallen through age the rocks too were
overhung with wild vines and briars which
completely matted themselves together and opposed
a barrier to all ingress every movement
that he made shook down a shower from the
dripping foliage he attempted to scale one 
these almost perpendicular heights he was
strong and agile but he found it an herculean
undertaking often he was supported merely
by crumbling projections the rock and sometimes
he clung to roots and branches trees
adolph heyliger 
and hung almost suspended in the air the
wood pigeon came cleaving his whistling flight
by him and the eagle screamed from the brow
 the impending cliff as he was thus clambering
he was on the point seizing hold 
a shrub to aid his ascent when something rustled
swiftly among the leaves and he saw a snake
quivering along like lightning almost from under
his hand it coiled itself up immediately
in an attitude defiance with flattened head
distended jaws and quickly vibrating tongue
that played like a little flame about its mouth
dolph's heart turned faint within him and he
had well nigh let go his hold and tumbled
down the precipice the serpent stood on the
defensive but for an instant it was an instinctive
movement defence and finding there
was no attack it glided away into a cleft the
rock dolph's eye followed it with fearful intensity
and he saw at a glance that he was in
the vicinity a nest adders that lay knotted
and writhing and hissing in the chasm
he hastened with all speed to escape from so
vol 
 adolph heyliger
frightful a neighbourhood his imagination
was full this new horror he saw an adder
in every curling vine and heard the tail a rattle
snake in every dry leaf that rustled
at length he succeeded in scrambling to the
summit a precipice but it was covered by a
dense forest wherever he could gain a lookout
between the trees he saw that the coast rose
into heights and cliffs one rising beyond another
until huge mountains overtopped the whole
there were no signs cultivation nor any
smoke curling from among the trees to indicate
a human residence every thing was wild and
solitary as he was standing on the edge a
precipice that overlooked a deep ravine fringed
with trees his feet detached a great fragment 
rock it fell crashing its way through the treetops
down into the chasm a loud whoop or
rather a yell issued from the bottom the glen 
the moment after there was the report a gun
and a ball came whistling over his head cutting
the twigs and leaves and burying itself deep in
the bark a chestnut tree
adolph heyliger 
dolph did not wait for a second shot but made
a precipitate retreat fearing every moment to
hear the enemy in pursuit he succeeded however
in returning unmolested to the shore and
determined to penetrate no farther into a country
so beset with savage perils
he sat himself down dripping disconsolately
on a wet stone what was to be done where
was he to shelter himself the hour repose
was approaching the birds were seeking their
nests the bat began to flit about in the twilight 
and the night hawk soaring high in heaven seemed
to be calling out the stars night gradually
closed in and wrapped every thing in gloom and
though it was the latter part summer yet the
breeze stealing along the river and among these
dripping forests was chilly and penetrating
especially to a halfdrowned man
as he sat drooping and despondent in this comfortless
condition he perceived a light gleaming
through the trees near the shore where the
winding the river made a deep bay it
cheered him with the hopes that here might be
 adolph heyliger
some human habitation where he might get
something to appease the clamorous cravings 
his stomach and what was equally necessary in
his shipwrecked condition a comfortable shelter
for the night it was with extreme difficulty
that he made his way towards the light along
ledges rocks down which he was in danger
 sliding into the river and over great trunks
 fallen trees some which had been blown
down in the late storm and lay so thickly together
that he had to struggle through their
branches at length he came to the brow a
rock that overhung a small dell from whence
the light proceeded it was from a fire at the
foot a great tree that stood in the midst a
grassy interval or plat among the rocks the
fire cast up a red glare among the gray crags and
impending trees leaving chasms deep gloom
that looked like entrances to caverns a small
brook rippled close by betrayed by the quivering
reflection the frame there were two
figures moving about the fire and others squatted
before it as they were between him and
adolph heyliger 
the light they were in complete shadow but one
 them happening to move round to the opposite
side dolph was startled at perceiving by the
full glare falling on painted features and glittering
on silver ornaments that he was an indian
he now looked more narrowly and saw guns
leaning against a tree and a dead body lying on
the ground
dolph now began to doubt whether he was
not in a worse condition than before here was
the very foe that had fired at him from the glen
he endeavoured to retreat quietly not caring to
intrust himself to these half human beings in so
savage and lonely a place it was too late the
indian with that eagle quickness eye so remarkable
in his race perceived something stirring
among the bushes on the rock he seized
one the guns that leaned against the tree a
moment more and dolph might have had his
passion for adventure cured by a bullet he
hallooed loudly in the indian salutation friendship
the whole party sprang upon their feet 
the salutation was returned and the straggler
was invited to join them at the fire
 adolph heyliger
on approaching he found to his consolation
that the party was composed white men as
well as indians one who was evidently the
principal personage or commander was seated
on a trunk a tree before the fire he was a
large stout man somewhat advanced in life
but hale and hearty his face was bronzed almost
to the colour an indian's with strong
but rather jovial features an aquiline nose and
a mouth shaped like a mastiff's his face was
half thrown in shade by a broad hat with a
buck's tail in it his iron gray hair hung short
in his neck he wore a hunting frock with
indian leggings and mockasons and a tomahawk
in the broad wampum belt round his waist
as dolph caught a distinct view his person
and features he was struck with something that
reminded him the old man the haunted
house the man before him however was different
in his dress and age he was more cheery
too in his aspect and it was hard to define where
the vague resemblance lay but a resemblance
there certainly was dolph felt some degree 
adolph heyliger 
awe in approaching him but was assured by
the frank hearty welcome with which he was
received as he cast his eyes about too he
was still farther encouraged by perceiving that
the dead body which had caused him some alarm
was that a deer and his satisfaction was
complete in discovering by the savoury steams
which issued from a kettle suspended by a
hooked stick over the fire that there was a part
cooking for the evening's repast he now found
that he had fallen in with a rambling hunting
party such as often took place in those days
among the settlers along the river the hunter is
always hospitable and nothing makes men more
social and unceremonious than meeting in the
wilderness the commander the party
poured him out a dram cheering liquor which
he gave him with a merry leer to warm his
heart and ordered one his followers to fetch
some garments from a pinnace which was
moored in a cove close by while those in
which our hero was dripping might be dried
before the fire
 adolph heyliger
dolph found as he had suspected that the
shot from the glen which had come so near
giving him his quietus when on the precipice
was from the party before him he had nearly
crushed one them by the fragment rock
which he had detached and the jovial old
hunter in the broad hat and bucktail had fired
at the place where he saw the bushes move
supposing it to be some wild animal he
laughed heartily at the blunder it being what
is considered an exceeding good joke among
hunters but faith my lad said he if i
had but caught a glimpse you to take sight
at you would have followed the rock antony
vander heyden is seldom known to miss his
aim these last words were at once a clue
to dolph's curiosity and a few questions let
him completely into the character the man
before him and his band woodland rangers
the commander in the broad hat and
hunting frock was no less a personage than the
heer antony vander heyden albany 
whom dolph had many a time heard he was
adolph heyliger 
in fact the hero many a story being a man 
singular humours and whimsical habits that
were matters wonder to his quiet dutch neighbours
as he was a man property having
had a father before him from whom he inherited
large tracts wild land and whole barrels full
 wampum he could indulge his humours
without control instead staying quietly at
home eating and drinking at regular meal times
amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the
bench before the door and then turning into a
comfortable bed at night he delighted in all
kinds rough wild expeditions he was
never so happy as when on a hunting party in
the wilderness sleeping under trees or bark
sheds or cruising down the river or on some
woodland lake fishing and fowling and living
the lord knows how
he was a great friend to indians and to an
indian mode life which he considered true
natural liberty and manly enjoyment when at
home he had always several indian hangerson
who loitered about his house sleeping like
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
hounds in the sunshine or preparing hunting and
fishing tackle for some new expedition or shooting
at marks with bows and arrows over these
vagrant beings heer antony had as perfect command
as a huntsman over his pack though they
were great nuisances to the regular people his
neighbourhood as he was a rich man no one
ventured to thwart his humours indeed he had
a hearty joyous manner about him that made him
universally popular he would troll a dutch
song as he tramped along the street hail everyone
half a mile off and when he entered a house
he would slap the good man familiarly on his
back shake him by the hand till he roared and
kiss his wife and daughters before his face in
short there was no pride nor ill humour about
heer antony
beside his indian hangerson he had three
or four humble friends among the white men
who looked up to him as a patron and had the
run his kitchen and the favour being taken
with jim occasionally on his expeditions it
was with a medley such retainers that he was
adolph heyliger 
at present on a cruize along the shores the
hudson in a pinnace which he kept for his own
recreation there were two white men with
him dressed partly in the indian style with
mockasons and hunting shirts the rest his
crew consisted four favourite indians they
had been prowling about the river without any
definite object until they had found themselves
in the highlands where they had passed two or
three days hunting the deer which still lingered
among those mountains
it is a lucky circumstance young man
said antony vander heyden that you happened
to be knocked overboard today as tomorrow
morning we start early on our return
homewards and you might then have looked
in vain for a meal among these mountains
u but come lads stir about stir about let's
see what prog we have for supper the kettle
has boiled long enough my stomach cries cupboard
 and i'll warrant our guest is in no mood
to dally with his trencher
there was a bustle now in the little encamped
adolph heyliger
merit one took off the kettle and turned apart 
the contents into a huge wooden bowl another
prepared a flat rock for a table while a third
brought various utensils from the pinnace which
was moored close by and heer antony himself
brought a flask or two precious liquor from
his own private locker knowing his boon companions
too well to trust any them with the
key a rude but hearty repast was soon spread 
consisting smoking venison and cold bacon
with indian corn and round brown loaves 
good household bread never had dolph made
a more delicious repast and when he had washed
it down by two or three draughts from the
heer antony's flask and felt the jolly liquor sending
its warmth through his veins and glowing
round his heart he would not have changed his
situation no not with the governor the
province
the heer antony too grew chirping and
joyous he told half a dozen fat stories at which
his white followers laughed immoderately
though the indians as usual maintained an invincible
gravity this is your true life my
bolfh heyliger 
boy would he say slapping dolph on the
shoulder a man is never a man till he can
defy wind and weather range in the woods
sleep under a tree and live on bass wood leaves 
and then he would sit with his hat on one side
swaying a short squab dutch bottle in his hand
and sing a stave or two a dutch drinking
song to which his myrmidons would join in
chorus
with all his joviality however he mingled
discretion though he pushed the bottle unreservedly
to dolph yet he always took care to
help his followers himself and was particular in
only granting a certain allowance to the indians
heer antony knew the kind beings he had to
deal with
the repast was now at an the indians
had made their supper in silence from the contents
 the kettle and having drank their allowance
and smoked their pipes they wrapped
themselves in their blankets stretched themselves
on the ground with their feet to the fire and
soon fell asleep the others remained chatting
 adolph heyliger
before the fire which the gloom the forest and
the dampness the air from the late storm rendered
extremely comfortable and cheering
the conversation gradually moderated from
the hilarity supper time and turned upon
hunting adventures and exploits and perils in the
wilderness many which were so strange and
improbable that i will not venture to repeat
them lest the veracity heer antony and his
comrades be brought into question there were
many legendary tales told also about the river
and the settlements on its borders and as heer
antony sat in a twisted root a fallen tree that
served him for a kind arm chair and told these
wild stories with the fire gleaming on his strongly
marked face dolph was again repeatedly
struck with something in his looks that reminded
him the nightly visiter to the haunted house
the circumstance dolph's falling overboard
led to the relation anecdotes mishaps that
had befallen voyagers on this great river many
 which were attributed to supernatural causes
on dolph's staring at this suggestion antony
adolph heyliger 
vander heyden assured him that it was very
currently believed among the settlers along the
river that these highlands were under the dominion
 supernatural and mischievous beings 
which seemed particularly to vent their spleen
upon the dutch skippers some he said believed
them to be the evil spirits conjured up by
the indian wizards in the early times the
province to revenge themselves on the strangers
who had dispossessed them their country the
greater part however accounted for them by
the legend the storm ship which haunted
pointnopoint finding dolph to be utterly
ignorant this tradition heer antony undertook
to tell it in the very words in which it had
been written out by mynheer selon an early
poet the newnetherlands giving therefore
a stir to the fire he adjusted himself comfortably
in his root a tree and throwing back his
head and closing his eyes for a few moments to
summon up his recollection he related the follow t 
ing legend
 adolph heyliger
the storm ship
in the golden age the province the
new netherlands when it was under the sway
 outer van tiller otherwise called walter
the doubter the people the manhattoes
were alarmed one sultry afternoon just about
the time the summer solstice by a tremendous
storm thunder and lightning the rain descended
in such torrents as absolutely to spatter
up and smoke along the ground it seemed as
if the thunder rattled and rolled over the very
roofs the houses the lightning was seen
to play about the church st nicholas and
to strive three times in vain to strike its weather
cock garret van home's new chimney
was split almost from top to bottom and doffue
mildeberger was struck speechless from his baldfaced
mare just as as he was riding into town
in a word it was one those unparalleled
storms that only happen once within the meadolph
heyliger 
more that venerable personage known in all
towns by the appellation the oldest inhabitant

great was the terror the good old women
 the manhattoes they gathered their children
together and took refuge in the cellars after
having hung a shoe on the iron point every
bed post lest they should attract the lightning
at length the storm abated the thunder sunk
into a growl and the setting sun breaking from
under the fringed borders the clouds made
the broad bosom the bay to gleam like a sea
 molten gold
the word was given from the fort that a ship
was standing up the bay it passed from mouth
to mouth and street to street and soon put the
little capital in a bustle the arrival a ship
in those early times the settlement was an
event vast importance to the inhabitants it
brought them news from the old world from the
land their birth from which they were so completely
severed to the yearly ship too they
looked for their supply luxuries finery 
vol 
adolph heyliger
comforts and almost necessaries the good
vrouw could not have her new cap nor new
gown until the arrival the ship the artist
waited for it for his tools the burgomaster for
his pipe and his supply hollands the schoolboy
for his top and marbles and the lordly
landholder for the bricks with which he was to
build his new mansion thus every one rich
and poor great and small looked out for the arrival
 the ship it was the great yearly
event the town new amsterdam and
from one the year to the other the ship
the ship the ship was the continual topic
 conversation
the news from the fort therefore brought all
the populace down to the battery to behold the
wishedfor sight it was not exactly the time
when she had been expected to arrive and the
circumstance was a matter some speculation
many were the groups collected about the battery
here and there might be seen a burgomaster 
slow and pompous gravity giving his opinion
with great confidence to a crowd old women
adolph heyllger 
and idle boys at another place was a knot 
old weather beaten fellows who had been seamen
or fishermen in their times and were great
authorities on such occasions these gave different
opinions and caused great disputes among
their several adherents but the man most
looked up to and followed and watched by the
crowd was hans van pelt an old dutch sea captain
retired from service the nautical oracle 
the place he reconnoitred the ship through
an ancient telescope covered with tarry canvas
hummed a dutch tune to himself and said no
things hum however from hans van pek
had always more weight with the public thana
speech from another man
in the mean time the ship became more distinct
to the naked eye she was a stout round
dutch built vessel with high bow and poop and
bearing dutch colours the evening sun gilded
her bellying canvas as she came riding over
the long waving billows the sentinel who had
given notice her approach declared that he
first got sight her when she was in the centre
 adolph heyliger
 the bay and that she broke suddenly upon
his sight just as if she had come out the bosom
 the black thunder cloud the bystanders
looked at hans van pelt to see what he
would say to this report hans van pelt screwed
his mouth closer together and said nothing 
upon which some shook their heads and others
shrugged their shoulders
the ship was now repeatedly hailed but made
no reply and passing by the fort stood on up the
hudson a gun was brought to bear on her
and with some difficulty loaded and fired by
hans van pelt the garrison not being expert in
artillery the shot seemed absolutely to pass
through the ship and to skip along the water
on the other side but no notice was taken it
what was strange she had all her sails set and
sailed right against wind and tide which were
both down the river
upon this hans van pelt who was likewise
harbour master ordered his boat and set off to
board her but after rowing for two or three hours
he returned without success sometimes he
adolph heyliger 
would get within one or two hundred yards 
her and then in a twinkling she would be half
a mile off some said it w r as because his oarsmen
who were rather pursy and short winded
stopped every now and then to take breath and
spit on their hands but this it is probable was a
mere scandal h e got near enough however to
see the crew who were all dressed in the dutch
style the officers in doublets and high hats and
feathers not a word was spoken by any one
on board they stood as motionless as so many
statues and the ship seemed as ifleft to her own
government thus she kept on away up the
river lessening and lessening in the evening sunshine
until she faded from sight like a little
white cloud melting away in a summer sky
the appearance this ship threw the governor
into one the deepest doubts that ever beset
him in the whole course his administration
fears were entertained for the security the
infant settlements on the river lest this might
be an enemy's ship in disguise sent to take
possession the governor called together his
counsel repeatedly to assist him with their conadolph
heyliger
lectures he sat in his chair state built 
timber from the sacred forest the hague and
smoked his long jasmin pipe and listened to
all that his counsellors had to say on a subject
about which they knew nothing but in spite 
all the conjecturing the sagest and oldest heads
the governor still continued to doubt
messengers were despatched to different places
on the river but they returned without any
tidings the ship had made no port day after
dny and week after week elapsed but she never
returned down the hudson as however the
council seemed solicitous for intelligence they
soon had it in abundance the captains the
sloops seldom arrived without bringing some report
 having seen the strange ship at different
parts the river sometimes near the pallisadoes
 sometimes off croton point and sometimes
in the highlands but she was never reported
as having been seen above the highlands
the crews the sloops it is true generally differed
among themselves in their accounts 
these apparitions but that may have arisen
adolph heyliger 
from the uncertain situations in which they saw
her sometimes it was by the flashes a thunder
storm lighting up a pitchy night and giving
glimpses her careering across tappaan zee or
the wide waste haverstraw bay at one
moment she would appear close upon them as if
likely to run them down and would throw
them into great bustle and alarm when the next
flash would show her far off always sailing
against the wind sometimes in quiet moonlight
nights she would be seen under some high
bluff the highlands all in deep shadow excepting
her topsails glittering in the moonbeams
by the time however that the voyagers
would reach the place there would be no ship
to be seen and when they had passed on for
some distance and looked back behold there
she was again with her topsails in the moonshine
 her appearance was always just after
or just before or just in the midst unruly
weather and she was known by all the skippers
and voyagers the hudson by the name the
storm ship
 adolph heyligeu
these reports perplexed the governor and his
council more than ever and it would be endless
to repeat the conjectures and opinions that
were uttered on the subject some quoted
cases in point ships seen off the coast 
newengland navigated by witches and goblins
old hans van pelt who had been more
than once to the dutch colony at the cape 
good hope insisted that this must be the flying
dutchman which had so long haunted table
bay but being unable to make port had
now sought another harbour others suggested
that if it really was a supernatural apparition
as there was every natural reason to believe
it might be hendrick hudson and his crew 
the half moon who it was well known had
once run aground in the upper part the river
in seeking a northwest passage to china this
opinion had very little weight with the governor 
but it passed current out doors indeed it
had already been reported that hendrick hudson
and his crew haunted the kaatskill mountain
 and it appeared very reasonable to 
heyliger 
pose that his ship might infest the river where
the enterprise was baffled or that it might bear
the shadowy crew to their periodical revels in
the mountain
other events occurred to occupy the thoughts
and doubts the sage outer and his council 
and the storm ship ceased to be a subject 
deliberation at the board it continued however
to be a matter popular belief and marvellous
anecdote throughout the whole time 
the dutch goverment and particularly just before
the capture newamsterdam and the
subjugation the province by the english
squadron about that time the storm ship
was repeatedly seen in the tappaan zee about
weehawk and even down as far as hoboken
and her appearance was supposed to be ominous
 the approaching squall in public affairs
and the downfall dutch domination
since that time we have no authentic accounts
 her though it is said she still haunts
the highlands and cruises about pointnopoint
people who live along the river insist that they
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
sometimes see her in summer moonlight and
that in a deep still midnight they have heard
the chant her crew as if heaving the lead 
but sights and sounds are so deceptive along
the mountainous shores and about the wide
bays and long reaches this great river that
i confess i have very strong doubts upon the
subject
it is certain nevertheless that strange things
have been seen in these highlands in storms
which are considered as connected with the old
story the ship the captains the river
craft talk a little bulbousbottomed dutch
goblin in trunk hose and su garloaf d hat with
a speaking trumpet in his hand which they say
keeps about the dunderberg mountain they
declare that they have heard him in stormy
weather in the midst the turmoil giving orders
in low dutch for the piping up a fresh gust 
wind or the rattling off another thunder clap
that sometimes he has been seen surrounded by
a crew little imps in broad breeches and short
doublets tumbling head over heels in the rack
adolph meyliger
and mist and playing a thousand gambols in
the air or buzzing like a swarm flies about
antony's nose and that at such time the
hurryscurry the storm was always greatest
one time a sloop in passing by dunderberg
was overtaken by a thunderous that came
scouring down from the mountain and seemed
to burst just over the vessel though tight and
well ballasted yet she laboured dreadfully and
rocked until the water came over the gunwale
all the crew were amazed when it was discovered
that there was a little white sugarloaf hat on
the mast head w which was known at once for
the hat the heer the dunderberg nobody
however dared to climb to the mast head
and get rid this terrible hat the sloop continued
labouring and rocking as if she would
have rolled her mast overboard she seemed
in continual danger either upsetting or running
on shore in this way she drove quite
through the highlands until she had passed
pollopeps island where it is said the jurisdiction
 the dunderberg potentate ceases no
 adolph heyliger
sooner had she passed this bourne than the little
hat all at once spun up into the air like a top 
whirled up all the clouds into a vortex and
hurried them back to the summit the under
 while the sloop righted herself and sailed
on as quietly as if in a millpond nothing
saved her from utter wreck but the fortunate
circumstance having a horse shoe nailed
against the mast a wise precaution against evil
spirits which has since been adopted by all the
dutch captains that navigate this haunted river
there is another story told this foul weather
urchin by skipper daniel ouslesticker 
fishkill who was never known to tell a lie
he declared that in a severe squall he saw him
seated astride his bowsprit riding the sloop
ashore full butt against antony's nose
and that he was exorcised by dominie van
gibson esopus who happened to be onboard
and who sung the hymn st nicholas 
whereupon the goblin threw himself up in the
air like a ball and went off in a whirlwind
carrying away with him the nightcap the
adolph heyliger 
dominie's wife which was discovered the next

sunday morning hanging on the weathercock
 esopus church steeple at least forty miles
off after several events this kind had taken
place the regular skippers the river for a
long time did not venture to pass the under
without lowering their peak out homage
to the heer the mountain and it was
observed that all such as paid this tribute respect
were suffered to pass unmolested
such said antony vander heyden area
few the stories written down by selon the
poet concerning this storm ship which he affirms
to have brought this colony mischievous
imps into the province from some old ghostrid
den country europe i could give you a
host more if necessary for all the accidents
that so often befall the river craft in the highlands
are said to be tricks played off by these
 adolph heyliger
imps the dunderberg but i see that you are
nodding so let us turn in for the night
the moon had now just raised her silver
horns above the round back old bull hill 
and lit up the gray rocks and shagged forests 
and glittered on the waving bosom the river
the night dew was falling and the late gloomy
mountains began to soften and put on a gray
aerial tint in the dewy light the hunters stirred
the fire and threw on fresh fuel to qualify
the damp the night air they then prepared
a bed branches and dry leaves under a
ledge rocks for dolph while antony wander
heyden wrapping himself up in a huge coat
made skins stretched himself before the fire
it was some time however before dolph
could close his eyes he lay contemplating the
strange scene before him the wild w r gods and
rocks around the fire throwing fitful gleams on
the faces the sleeping savages and the heer
antony too who so singularly yet vaguely reminded
him the nightly visitant to the haunted
house now and then he heard the cry 
adolph heyliger 
some animal from the forest or the hooting 
the owl or the notes the whippoorwill which
seemed to abound among these solitudes or the
splash a sturgeon leaping out the river
and falling back full length on its placid surface
he contrasted all this with his accustomed nest
in the garret room the doctor's mansion 
where the only sounds he heard at night were
the church clock telling the hour the drowsy
voice the watchman drawling out that all was
well the deep snoring the doctor's clubbed
nose from below stairs or the cautious labours
 some carpenter rat gnawing in the wainscot
his thoughts then wandered to his poor old
mother what would she think his mysterious
disappearance what anxiety and distress
would she not suffer this was the thought that
would continually intrude itself to mar his present
enjoyment it brought with it a feeling 
pain and compunction and he fell asleep with
the tears yet standing in his eyes
were this a mere tale fancy here would
be a fine opportunity for weaving in strange 
adolph heyliger
ventures among these wild mountains and roving
hunters and after involving my hero ina
variety perils and unheardof difficulties
rescuing him from them all by some miraculous
contrivance but as this is absolutely a true
story i must content myself with simple facts
and keep to probabilities
at an early hour the next day therefore after
a hearty morning's meal the encampment
broke up and our adventurers embarked in the
pinnace antony vander heyden there being
no wind for the sails the indians rowed her
gently along keeping time to a kind chant
 one the white men the day was serene
and beautiful the river without a wave and
as the vessel cleft the glassy water it left a long
undulating track behind the crows who had
scented the hunters banquet were already
gathering and hovering in the air just where a
column thin blue smoke rising from among
the trees showed the place their last night's
quarters as they coasted along the bases 
the mountains the heer antony pointed out to
adolph heyliger 
dolph a bald eagle the sovereign these regions
who sat perched on a dry tree that projected
over the river and with eye turned upwards
seemed to be drinking in the splendour
 the morning sun their approach disturbed
the monarch's meditations he first spread one
wing and then the other balanced himself fora
moment and then quitting his perch with
dignified composure wheeled slowly over their
heads dolph snatched up a gun and sent a
whistling ball after him that cut some the
feathers from his wing the report the gun
leaped sharply from rock to rock and awakened
a thousand echoes but the monarch the
air sailed calmly on ascending higher and higher
and wheeling widely as he ascended soaring
up the green bosom the woody mountain
until he disappeared over the brow a beetling
precipice dolph felt in a manner rebuked by
this proud tranquillity and almost reproached
himself for having so wantonly insulted this
majestic bird heer antony told him laughing
to remember that he was not yet out the tervol
n 
 adolph heyligelt
histories the lord the dunderberg and an old
indian shook his head and observed that there
was bad luck in killing an eagle the hunter on
the contrary should always leave horn a portion
 his spoils
nothing however occurred to molest them
on their voyage they passed pleasantly through
these magnificent and lonely scenes until they
came to where pollopel's island lies like a floating
bower at the extremity the highlands
here they landed until the heat the day should
abate or a breeze spring up that might supersede
the labour the oar some prepared the midday
meal while others reposed under the shade
 the trees in luxurious summer indolence 
looking drowsily forth upon the beauty the
scene on the one side were the highlands
vast and cragged feathered to the top with forests
and throwing their shadows on the glassy
water that dimpled at their feet on the other
side was a wide expanse the river like a
broad lake with long sunny reaches and green
headlands and the distant line shawungunk
adolph heyliger 
mountains waving along a clear horizon or chequered
by a fleecy cloud
but i forbear to dwell on the particulars 
their cruize along the river this vagrant amphibious
life careering across silver sheets 
water coasting wild woodland shores banquetting
on shady promontories with the spreading
tree overhead the river curling its light foam
to one's feet and distant mountain and rock and
tree and snowy cloud and deep blue sky all
mingling in summer beauty before one all this
though never cloying in the enjoyment would
be but tedious in narration
when encamped by the water side some 
the party would go into the woods and hunt 
others would fish sometimes they would amuse
themselves by shooting at a mark by leaping by
running by wrestling and dolph gained great
favour in the eyes antony vander hey den
by his skill and adroitness in all these exercises
which the heer considered as the highest 
manly accomplishments
 adolph heyligek
thus did they coast jollily on choosing only
the pleasant hours for voyaging sometimes in
the cool morning dawn sometimes in the sober
evening twilight and sometimes when the
moonshine spangled the crisp curling waves
that whispered along the sides their little bark
never had dolph felt so completely in his element
 never had he met with any thing so completely
to his taste as this wild haphazard life
he was the very man to second antony vander
heyden in his rambling humours and gained
continually on his affections the heart the
old bushwhacker yearned towards the young
man who seemed thus growing up in his own
likeness and as they approached the their
voyage he could not help inquiring a little into
his history dolph frankly told him his course
 life his severe medical studies his little proficiency
and his very dubious prospects the
heer vas shocked to find that such amazing
talents and accomplishments were to be cramped
and buried under a doctor's wig he had a sovereign
contempt for the healing art having never
adolph heyliger 
had any other physician than the butcher he
bore a mortal grudge to all kinds study also
ever since he had been flogged about an unintelligible
 when he was a boy but to think
that a young fellow like dolph such wonderful
abilities who could shoot fish run jump
ride and wrestle should be obliged to roll pills
and administer juleps for a living twas monstrous
 he told dolph never to despair but to
throw physic to the dogs for a young fellow
 his prodigious talents could never fail to make
his way as you seem to have no acquaintance
in albany said heer antony you shall go
home with me and remain under my roof until
you can look about you and in the mean time y
we can take an occasional bout at shooting and
fishing for it is a pity such talents should be
idle
dolph who was at the mercy chance was
not hard to be persuaded indeed on turning
over matters in his mind which he did very sagely
and deliberately he could not but think that antony
vander heyden was somehow or other 
 adolph heyligek
connected with the story the haunted house 
that the misadventure in the highlands which
had thrown them so strangely together was
somehow or other to work out something
good in short there is nothing so convenient as
this somehow or other way accommodating
one's self to circumstances it is the mainstay
 a heedless actor and tardy reasoner like
dolph heyliger and he who can in this loose
easy way link foregone evil to anticipated good
possesses a secret happiness almost equal to
the philosopher's stone
on their arrival at albany the sight dolph's
companion seemed to cause universal satisfaction
many were the greetings at the river side
and the salutations in the streets the dogs
bounded before him the boys whooped as he
passed every body seemed to know antony
vander heyden dolph followed on in silence
admiring the neatness this worthy burgh for
in those days albany was in all its glory inhabited
almost exclusively by the descendants 
the original dutch settlers it had not as yet
adolph heyliger 
been discovered and colonized by the restless
people newengland every thing was quiet
and orderly every thing was conducted calmly
and leisurely no hurry no bustle no struggling
and scrambling for existence the grass
grew about the unpaved streets and relieved the
eye by its refreshing verdure tall sycamores
or pendent willows shaded the houses with caterpillars
swinging in long silken strings from
their branches or moths fluttering about like
coxcombs in joy at their gay transformation
the houses were built in the old dutch style
with the gable ends towards the street the
thrifty housewife was seated on a bench before
her door in a close crimped cap bright flowered
gown and white apron busily employed in knitting
the husband smoked his pipe on the opposite
bench and the little pet negro girl seated
on the step at her mistress feet was industriously
plying her needle the swallows sported
about the eaves or skimmed along the streets
and brought back some rich booty for their clamorous
young and the little housekeeping wren
 adolph heyliger
flew in and out a lilliputian house or an old
hat nailed against the wall the cows were
coming home lowing through the streets to be
milked at their owners doors and if perchance
there were any loiterers some negro urchin with
a long goad was gently urging them homewards
as dolph's companion passed on he received
a tranquil nod from the burghers and a friendly
word from their wives all calling him familiarly
by the name anton j for it was the custom
in this strong hold the patriarchs where they
had all grown up together from childhood to
call every one by the christian name the
heer did not pause to have his usual jokes with
them for he was impatient to reach his home
at length they arrived at his mansion it was
 some magnitude in the dutch style with
large iron figures on the gables that gave the
date its erection and showed that it had been
built in the earliest times the settlement
the news heer antony's arrival had preceded
him and the whole household was on
the look out a crew negroes large and
dolfh heyliger 
small had collected in front the house to receive
him the old whiteheaded ones who
had grown gray in his service grinned for joy
and made many awkward bows and grimaces 
and the little ones capered about his knees but
the most happy being in the household was a
little plump blooming lass his only child and
the darling his heart she came bounding
out the house but the sight a strange
young man with her father called up for a moment
all the bashfulness a homebred damsel
dolph gazed at her with wonder and delight
never had he seen as he thought any thing so
comely in the shape woman she was dressed
in the good old dutch taste with long stays
and full short petticoats so admirably adapted to
show and set off the female form her hair
turned up under a small round cap displayed
the fairness her forehead she had fine blue
laughing eyes a trim slender waist and soft
swell but in a word she was a little dutch
divinity and dolph who never stopped half
vol 
 adolph heyliger
way in a new impulse fell desperately in love
with her
dolph was now ushered into the house with
a hearty welcome in the interior was a mingled
display heer antony's taste and habits and
the opulence his predecessors the chambers
were furnished with good old carved mahogany
the beaufets and cupboards glittered with embossed
silver and painted china over the parlour
fireplace was as usual the family coat 
arms painted and framed above which was a
long duck fowling piece flanked by an indian
pouch and a powderhorn the room was decorated
with many indian articles such as pipes
 peace tomahawks scalping knives hunting
pouches and belts wampum and there were
various kinds fishing tackle and two or three
fowling pieces in the corners the household
affairs seemed to be conducted in some measure
after the master's humours corrected perhaps
by a little quiet management the daughter's
there was a great degree patriarchal simplicity
and good humoured indulgence the neadolph
heyliger 
goes came into the room without being called
merely to look at their master and hear his
adventures they would stand listening at the
door until he had finished a story and then go
off on a broad grin to repeat it in the kitchen
a couple pet negro children were playing
about the floor with the dogs and sharing with
them their bread and butter all the domestics
looked hearty and happy and when the table
was set for the evening repast the variety and
abundance good household luxuries bore testimony
to the open handed liberality the heer
and the notable housewifery his daughter
in the evening there dropped in several the
worthies the place the van rensselaer
and the gansevoorts and the rosebooms and
others antony vander heyden's intimates
to hear an account his expedition for he was
the sindbad albany and his exploits and adventures
were favourite topics conversation
among the inhabitants while these sat gossiping
together about the door the hall and
telling long twilight stories dolph was cosily
 adolph heyliger
seated entertaining the daughter on a window
bench he had already got on intimate terms
for those were not times false reserve and
idle ceremony and besides there is something
wonderfully propitious to a lover's suit in th
delightful dusk a long summer evening it
gives courage to the most timid tongue and
hides the blushes the bashful the stars
alone twinkled brightly and now and then a
firefly streamed his transient light before the
window or wandering into the room flew
gleaming about the ceiling
what dolph whispered in her ear that long
summer evening it is impossible to say his
words were so low and indistinct that they have
never reached the ear the historian it is
probable however that they were to the purpose
for he had a natural talent at pleasing the
sex and was never long in company with a petticoat
without paying proper court to it in
the mean time the visitors one by one departed
antony vander heyden who had fairly talked
himself silent sat nodding alone in his chair by
adolph heyliger 
the door when he was suddenly aroused by the
hearty salute with which dolph heyliger had
unguardedly rounded off one his periods and
which echoed through the still chamber like the
report a pistol the heer started up rubbed
his eyes called for lights and observed that it
was high time to go to bed on parting for the
night he squeezed dolph heartily by the hand 
looked waggishly in his face shook his head
knowingly ah dolph dolph said he
chuckling i see you're a sly dogjust like i
was at your age 
the chamber in which our hero was lodged
was spacious and panelled with oak it was
furnished with clothes presses and mighty chests
 drawers well waxed and glittering with brass
ornaments these contained ample stock 
family linen for the dutch housewives had always
a laudable pride in showing off their household
treasures to strangers
dolph's mind however was too full to take
particular note the objects around him yet
he could not help continually comparing the free
 adolph heyligek
openhearted cheeriness this establishment
with the starveling sordid joyless housekeeping
at doctor knypperhausen's still there was
something that marred the enjoyment the idea
that he must take leave his hearty host and
pretty hostess and cast himself once more adrift
upon the world to linger here would be folly
he should only get deeper in love and for a
poor varlet like himself to aspire to the daughter
 the great heer vander heyden it was
madness to think such a thing the very
kindness that the girl had shown towards him
prompted him on reflection to hasten his departure
 it would be a poor return for the frank
hospitality his host to entangle his daughter's
heart in an injudicious attachment in a word
dolph was like many other young reasoners 
exceeding good hearts and giddy heads who
think after they act and act differently from what
they think who make excellent determinations
over night and forget to keep them the next
morning
adolph heyliger 
this is a fine conclusion truly my voyage
said he as he almost buried himself in a
sumptuous feather bed and drew the fresh white
sheets up to his chin here am i instead 
finding a bag money to carry home launched
in a strange place with scarcely a stiver in my
pocket and what is worse have jumped ashore
up to my very ears in love into the bargain
however added he after some pause stretching
himself and turning in bed i'm in good
quarters for the present at least so i'll e'en
enjoy the present moment and let the next take
care itself i dare say all will work out
some how or other for the best
as he said these words he reached out his hand
to extinguish the candle when he was suddenly
struck with astonishment and dismay for he
thought he beheld the spectre the haunted
house staring at him from a dusky part the
chamber a second look reassured him as he
perceived that what he had taken for the spectre
was in fact nothing but a flemish portrait that
hung in a shadowy corner just behind a clothes
 adolph heyliger
press it was however the precise representation
 his nightly visiter the same cloak and
belted jerkin the same grizzled beard and fixed
eye the same broad slouched hat with a feather
hanging over one side dolph now called to
mind the resemblance he had frequently remarked
between his host and the old man the haunted
house and was fully convinced that they were
in some way connected and that some especial
destiny had governed his voyage he lay gazing
on the portrait with almost as much awe as he
had gazed on the ghostly original until the
shrill house clock warned him the lateness 
the hour he put out the light but remained
for a long time turning over these curious circumstances
and coincidences in his mind until
he fell asleep his dreams partook the nature
 his waking thoughts he fancied that he
still lay gazing on the picture until by degrees
it became animated that the figure descended
from the wall and walked out the room
that he followed it and found himself by the
well to which the old man pointed smiled on
him and disappeared
rolph heyliger 
in the morning when dolph waked he found
his host standing by his bed side who gave him
a hearty morning's salutation and asked him how
he had slept dolph answered cheerily and took
the occasion to inquire about the portrait that
hung against the wall ah said heer antony
 that's a portrait old killian vanderspie
gel once a burgomaster amsterdam who on
some popular troubles abandoned holland and
came over to the province during the government
 peter stuyvesant he was my ancestor
by the mother's side and an old miserly curmudgeon
he was when the english took
possession new amsterdam in he retired
into the country he fell into a melancholy
apprehending that his wealth would betaken
from him and that he would come to
beggary he turned all his property into cash
and used to hide it away he was for a year
or two concealed in various places fancying
himself sought after by the english to strip him
 his wealth and finally was found dead in
his bed one morning without any one being
vol h 
 adolph heylgek
able to discover where he had concealed the
greater part his money
when his host had left the room dolph remained
for some time lost in thought his
whole mind was occupied by what he had
heard vanderspiegel was his mother's family
name and he recollected to have heard her
speak this very killian vanderspiegel as one
 her ancestors he had heard her say too
that her father was killian's rightful heir only
that the old man died without leaving any thing
to be inherited it now appeared that heer
antony was likewise a descendant and perhaps
an heir also this poor old rich man 
and that thus the heyligers and the vander
hey dens were remotely connected what
thought he if after all this is the interpretation
 my dream j that this is the way i am to
make my fortune by this voyage to albany
and that i am to find the old man's hidden
wealth in the bottom that well but
what an odd roundabout mode communicating
the matter why the vengeance could not
adolph heyliger 
the old goblin have told me about the well at
once without sending me all the way to albany
to hear a story that was to send me all
the way back again 
these thoughts passed through his mind ashe
was dressing he descended the stairs full
 perplexity when the bright face marie
vander heyden suddenly beamed in smiles
upon him and seemed to give him a clue to the
whole mystery after all thought he the
old goblin is in the right if am to get his
wealth he means that i shall marry his pretty
descendant thus both branches the family
will be again united and the property go on in
the proper channel
no sooner did this idea enter his head than it
carried conviction with it he was now all impatience
to hurry back and secure the treasure 
which he did not doubt lay at the bottom 
the well and which he feared every moment
might be discovered by some other person
who knows thought he but this nightwalking
old fellow the haunted house may
 adolph heyliger
be in the habit haunting every visiter and may
give a hint to some shrewder fellow than myself
who will take a shorter cut to the well than by
the way albany he wished a thousand
times that the babbling old ghost was laid in the
red sea and his rambling portrait with him
he was in a perfect fever to depart two or
three days elapsed before any opportunity presented
for returning down the river they were
ages to dolph notwithstanding that he was
basking in the smiles the pretty marie and
daily getting more and more enamoured at
length the very sloop from which he had been
knocked overboard prepared to make sail dolph
made an awkward apology to his host for his
sudden departure antony vaiider heyden was
sorely astonished he had concerted half a
dozen excursions into the wilderness and his
indians were actually preparing for a grand expedition
to one the lakes he took dolph
aside and exerted his eloquence to get him to
give up all thoughts business and to remain
with him but in vain and he at length gave
adolph heyliger 
up the attempt observing that it was a thousand
pities so fine a young man should throw
himself away heer antony however gave
him a hearty shake by the hand at parting with
a favourite fowling piece and an invitation to
come to his house whenever he revisited albany
the pretty little marie said nothing but as he
gave her a farewell kiss her dimpled cheek
turned pale and a tear stood in her eye
dolph sprang lightly on board the vessel
they hoisted sail the wind was fair they
soon lost sight albany and its green hills
and embowered islands they were wafted
gaily past the kaatskill mountains whose fairy
heights were bright and cloudless they passed
prosperously through the highlands without
any molestation from the dunderberg goblin and
his crew they swept on across haverstraw
bay and by croton point and through the
tappaan zee and under the pallisadoes until
on the afternoon the third day they saw the
promontory hoboken hanging like a cloud in
 adolph heyliger
the air and shortly after the roofs the manbattles
rising out the water
dolph's first care was to repair to his mother's
house for he was continually goaded by the
idea the uneasiness she must experience on
his account on his way thither he endeavoured
to arrange some mode accounting for his
absence but felt sadly at a loss for with all his
heedlessness he was naturally frank and sincere
and had never deceived her he had conned
over something that he thought would do when
on entering the street in which her house was
situated he was thunderstruck on beholding ita
heap ruins there had been a great fire
which had destroyed several large houses and
the humble dwelling poor dame heyliger had
been involved in the conflagration the walls
were not so completely destroyed but that dolph
could perceive some traces the scene humble
quiet the scene his childhood the fireplace
with a few the tiles yet remained
though shattered to pieces the wreck the
good old dame's elbow chair and her dutch
adolph heyliger 
family bible reduced almost to a cinder lay
among the rubbish for a moment dolph's
head reeled he was stunned as with a blow 
but the next was a moment excruciating
agony for the idea rushed to his mind that she
had perished in the flames he was relieved
from the worst his fears by one the neighbours
who informed him that his mother was
yet alive but that overcome with fright and
affliction she lay ill at the house old peter
che groodt where she had taken refuge
dolph hastened thither with the penitent
feeling the prodigal son he recalled all
her tenderness her unwearied attention to his
comfort her indulgence his errors her
fond blindness to his faults and then he reflected
on his own idleness and want consideration
 only let her live said dolph
mentally and clasping his hands and i'll
show myself indeed a son 
he found old peter de groodt coming out
 the house peter started back on seeing
him and was for a moment doubtful whether
 adolph heyliger
it was not a ghost that stood before him then
shaking his head he pointed to the door ah
young man young man you're in a hopeful
way truly go in go in and see your poor
mother more sick on your account than her
own
it required some preparation however before
dolph's return could be made known to his
mother and even then the news almost overcame
her when he was admitted to see her
he sunk down beside her bed the poor woman
threw her arms round his neck my boy
my boy art thou still alive for a time she
seemed to have forgotten all her losses and
troubles in her joy at his return at length
recollecting herself ah my poor dolph 
said she thy mother can help thee no longer 
she can no longer help herself what will
become thee my poor son 
mother said dolph don't talk in that
way i've been too long a charge upon you
it's now my part to take care you in your old
days but come be good heart i'm here
adolph heyliger 
again sound and hearty something will yet
turn up things will all olph heyliger
was filled with broad golden pieces a coinage
which he had never seen before it was evident
he had lit on the place where old killian
vanderspiegel had concealed his treasure
fearful being seen by some straggler he
cautiously retired and buried his pot money
in a secret place he now spread terrible stones
about the haunted house and deterred
every one from approaching it while he made
frequent visits to it in stormy days when no one
was stirring in the neighbouring fields though
to tell the truth he did not care to venture therein
the dark for once in his life he was diligent
and industrious and followed up his new
trade angling with such perseverance and
success that in a little while he had hooked up
wealth enough to make him in those moderate
days a rich burgher for life
it would be tedious to detail minutely the
rest his story to tell how he gradually
managed to bring his property into use without
exciting surprise and inquiry how he satisfied
all scruples with regard to retaining the proadolph
heyliger 
party and at the same time gratified his own
feelings by marrying the pretty marie vander
hey den and how he and heer antony had
many a merry and roving expedition together
i must not omit to say however that dolph
took his mother home to live with him and cherished
her in her old days the good dame too
had the satisfaction no longer hearing her son
made the theme censure on the contrary he
grew daily in public esteem every body spoke
well him and his wines and the loveliest
burgomaster was never known to decline his invitation
to dinner dolph often related at his
own table the wicked pranks which had once
been the abhorrence the town but they were
now considered excellent jokes and the gravest
dignitary was ready to die with laughing at them
no one was more struck with dolph's increasing
merit than his old master the doctor and
so forgiving was dolph in his temper that he
absolutely employed the doctor as his family
physician only taking care that his prescriptions
should always be thrown out the 
adolph heylioer
dow his mother had often her junto old
cronies to take a snug cup tea with her in her
comfortable little parlour and peter de groodt
as he sat by the fire side with one her grandchildren
on his knee would many a time congratulate
her upon her son's turning out so great
a man upon which the good old soul would
wag her head with exultation and exclaim ah
neighbour neighbour did i not say that dolph
would one day or other hold up his head with
the best them 
thus did dolph heyliger go on cheerily
and prosperously growing merrier as he grew
older and wiser and completely falsifying the
old proverb about money got over the devil's
back for he made good use his wealth and
became a distinguished citizen and a valuable
member the community he was a great
promoter public institutions such as beefsteak
societies and catch clubs he presided
at all public dinners and was the first that introduced
turtle from the west indies he improved
the breed race horses and game cocks 
adolph heyliger 
he was a great patron modest merit insomuch
that any one who could sing a good song
or tell a good story was sure to find a place at
his table and his benevolence became so well
known that every now and then a bantling was
laid at his door which he never failed to take
into the house and cherish as his own
he was a member too the corporation made
several laws for the protection game and oysters
and bequeathed to the board a large silver
punch bowl made out the identical porringer
before mentioned and which is in the possession
 the corporation to this very day
finally he died at a florid and jolly old age
 an apoplexy at a corporation feast and was
buried with great honours in the yard the little
dutch church in garden street where his
tombstone may still be seen with an epitaph in
dutch verse by his friend mynheer justus benson
an ancient and excellent poet the manbattles

the foregoing tale rests on better authority
than most tales the kind as i have it at second
 adolph heyliger
hand from the lips dolph hejliger himself
he never related it until towards the latter part
 his life and then in great confidence for he
was very discreet to a few particular cronies at
his own table over an extra bowl punch 
and strange as the hobgoblin parts the story
may seem there never was a single doubt expressed
on the subject by any his guests it
may not be amiss before concluding to observe
that in addition to his other accomplishments
dolph heyliger was noted for being the ablest
drawer the long bow in the whole province
the wedding
no more no more much honor aye betide
the lofty bridegroom and the lovely bride
that their succeeding days and years may say
each day appears like to a marriage day
braithttaite
the fair julia having recovered from the
effects her fall the day for the wedding was
at length appointed as it drew near there rose
several doubts and conversations between lady
lilly craft master simon and the parson on the
subject marrying in the month may 
against which i find there is an ancient prejudice
as being an unfortunate month for matrimony
from the discussions that took place
on these occasions i picked up much valuable
information relative to weddings such as that
if there were two celebrated in the same church
tol n 
 the wedding
on the same day the first would be happy the
second otherwise if in going to church they
should meet the funeral a female the bride
would die first if a male the bridegroom
if the new married couple were to dance together
on their wedding day the wife would
thenceforth rule the roast with many more curious
facts the same kind which made me
ponder more than ever upon the perils which
surround this happy state and how little men
know the awful risks they run in venturing upon
it i abstain however from enlarging on this
topic as i have no wish to promote the increase
 bachelors
the squire however though he gave due
weight to all these ancient saws yet had a host
 poetical authorities in favour this loving
month which i suppose were conclusive with
the young couple as i found they were perfectly
willing to marry in may and abide the consequences

the wedding has accordingly taken place at
the village church in presence a numerous
the wedding 
company relations and friends and many 
the tenantry the squire must needs have
something the old ceremonies observed on the
occasion so at the gate the churchyard
several little girls the village dressed in white
were in readiness with baskets flowers which
they strewed before the bride and the butler
bore before her the bride cup a great embossed
silver bowl one the family reliques from the
days the hard drinkers this was filled with
rich wine and decorated with a branch rosemary
tied with gay ribbands according to ancient
custom
happy is the bride that the sun shines on
says the old proverb and it was as sunny and
auspicious a morning as heart could wish the
bride looked uncommonly beautiful but in
fact what woman does not look interesting on her
wedding day there is something extremely
touching in the appearance a young and timid
bride in her robes virgin white led up trembling
to the altar when thus i behold a lovely
girl in the tenderness her years forsaking her
 the wedding
father's house and the home her childhood
and giving herself up with implicit confiding to
the man her choice in the good old language
 the ceremony for better for worse for
richer for poorer in sickness and in health to
love honour and obey till death us do part
it brings to my mind the beautiful self devotion
 ruth whither thou goes i will go and
where thou longest i will lodge thy people shall
be my people and thy god my god
the fair julia was supported on the trying
occasion by lady lillycraft whose heart was
overflowing with its wonted sympathy in all
matters love and matrimony as the bride
approached the altar her face would be one moment
covered with blushes and the next deadly
pale and she seemed almost ready to shrink from
sight among her female companions i do not
know what it is that makes every one serious
and as it were awe struck at a marriage ceremony
 which is generally considered as an occasion
 festivity and rejoicing as the ceremony
was performing i observed many a rosy
the wedding 
face among the country girls turn pale and i
did not see a smile throughout the church the
young ladies from the hall were almost as much
frightened as if it had been their own case and
stole many a look sympathy at their trembling
companion a tear stood in the eye the sensitive
lady lillycraft and as to phoebe wilkins
who was present the soft hearted baggage absolutely
wept and sobbed aloud but it is hard to
tell half the time what these fond foolish creatures
are crying about
the captain too though naturally gay and
unconcerned was much agitated on the occasion
and in attempting to put the ring upon the
bride's finger dropped it on the floor which i am
since told is a very lucky omen even master
simon had lost his usual vivacity and had assumed
a most whimsically solemn face which
he is apt to do on all occasions ceremony
he had much whispering with the parson and
parish clerk for he is always a busy personage
in the scene and he echoed the clerk's amen
with a solemnity and devotion that edified the
whole assemblage
 the wedding
the moment however that the ceremony
was over the transition was magical the
bride cup was passed round according to ancient
usage for the company to drink to a
happy union every one's feelings seemed to
break forth from restraint master simon had a
world bachelor pleasantries to utter and
as to the gallant general he bowed and cooed
about the dulcet lady lillycraft like a mighty
cock pigeon about his dame
the villagers gathered in the churchyard to
cheer the happy couple as they left the church
and the musical tailor had marshalled his band
and set up a hideous discord as the blushing
and smiling bride passed through a lane honest
peasantry to her carriage the children
shouted and threw up their hats the bells rang
a merry peal that threatened to bring down the
battlements the old tower and set all the
crows and rooks flying and cawing about the
air and there was a continual popping off 
rusty firelock from every part the neighbourhood

the wedding 
the prodigal son distinguished himself on
the occasion but had nearly done mischief as
the horses the bride's carriage took fright
from the discharge a row old gun barrels
which he had mounted as a park artillery in
front the school house to give the captain a
military salute as he passed
the day passed off with great rustic rejoin
kings tables were spread under the trees in
the park where all the peasantry the neighbourhood
were regaled with roast beef and
plum pudding and oceans ale ready money
jack presided at one the tables and became
so full good cheer as to unbend from
his usual gravity sing a song out all tune
and give two or three shouts laughter that
almost electrified his neighbours like so many
peals thunder slingsbyby the schoolmaster
and the apothecary vied with each
other in making speeches over their liquor and
there were occasional glees and musical performances
by the village band that must have
 the wedding
frightened every fawn and dryad from the
park
old christy even was warmed into a flow on
the occasion he appeared newly equipped
from top to toe with bright leather breeches
and a great wedding favour flaunting in his
jockey cap the old man drank health and
happiness to the young couple at least a dozen
times and ended by dancing a hornpipe on
one the tables to the great astonishment 
the whole world
equal gayety reigned within doors where a
large party friends were entertained everyone
laughed at his own pleasantry without attending
to that his neighbour's the bride
cup was carried about according to ancient form
and loads bride cake distributed the young
ladies were all busy in passing morsels cake
through the wedding ring to dream on and i
myself assisted a fine little boarding school girl
in putting up a quantity for her companions
which i have no doubt will set all the little
heads in the school gadding for a week to come
the wedding 
in the evening we were entertained by a display
 fireworks got up by the schoolmaster
and apothecary with the assistance the prodigal
son whom the squire talks making his
gamekeeper by way reward for his extraordinary
services the village also was generally
illuminated excepting the house the radical
who has not shown his face during the rejoin
kings
one wedding makes many says an old proverb
and i should not be surprised if it holds
good in the present instance i have seen several
flirtations among the young people that have
been brought together on this occasion master
simon however has told me in great confidence
that he thinks the old general's case is
desperate with lady lillycraft she having determined
that he is quite destitute sentiment
it is with some concern therefore that i have
seen him throwing away tender glances upon
her at the w r adding dinner during the changing
 the dishes
i am told moreover that young jack tibi
 
 the wedding
bets was so touched by the wedding ceremony
at which he was present and captivated by the
sensibility poor phoebe wilkins that he had
a reconciliation with her that very day after dinner
in one the groves the park and danced
with her at the village in the evening to the
complete confusion old dame tibbets
domestic politics
what is more lady lillycraft who with her
usual benevolence in all concerns the heart
had lately taken an interest in this love affair
on hearing the reconciliation the lovers
undertook the critical task breaking the matter
to ready money jack she thought there
was no time like the present and attacked the
sturdy old yeoman that very evening in the park
while his heart was yet lifted up with the squire's
good cheer jack was a little surprised at being
drawn aside by her ladyship but was not to be
flurried by such anhonour he was still more
surprised by the nature her communication 
and this first intelligence an affair that had
been passing under his eye he listened howthe
wedding 
ever with his usual gravity as her ladyship represented
the advantages the match the good
qualities the girl and the distress which all
parties had lately suffered at length his eye began
to kindle and his hand to play with the
head his cudgel lady lillycraft saw that
something in the narrative had gone wrong
and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating
the soft hearted phoebe's merit and
fidelity and her great unhappiness when old
ready money suddenly interrupted her by
exclaiming that if jack did not marry the
wench he'd break every bone in his body 
the match therefore is considered a settled
thing dame tibbets and the housekeeper have
made friends and drank tea together and phoebe
has again recovered her good looks and good
spirits and is caroling from morning till night
like a lark
but the most whimsical caprice cupid is
one that i should be almost afraid to mention
did i not know that i was writing for readers
well experienced in the waywardness this
 the wedding
most mischievous deity the morning after
the wedding therefore while lady lillycraft
was making preparations for her departure an
audience was requested by her immaculate handmaid
mrs hannah who with much primming
 the mouth and many maidenly hesitations
requested leave to stay behind and that lady
lillycraft would supply her place with some
other servant her ladyship was thunderstruck 
what hannah going to quit her that had lived
with her so long 
why one could not help it one must settle
in life some time or other
the good lady was still lost in amazement 
at length the secret was gasped from the dry
lips the maiden gentlewoman she had been
some time thinking changing her condition
and at length had given her word last evening
to mr christy the huntsman 
how or when or where this singular courtship
had been carried on i have not been able to
learn or how she has been able with the vinegar
 her disposition to soften the stony heart
the wedding 
 old nimrod so however it is and it has
astonished every one with all her ladyship's
love match making this last fume hymen's
torch has been too much for her she
has endeavoured to reason with mrs hannah
but all in vain her mind was made up and she
grew tart on the least contradiction lady lily
applied to the squire for his interference 
she did not know what she should do without
mrs hannah she had been used to have her
about her so long a time
the squire on the contrary rejoiced in the
match as relieving the good lady from a kind 
toilette tyrant under whose sway she had suffered
for years instead thwarting the affair
therefore he has given it his full countenance
and declares that he will set up the young
couple in one the best cottages on his estate
the approbation the squire has been followed
by that the whole household they all
declare that if ever matches are really made in
heaven this must have been for that old
christy and mrs hannah were as cordially
 the wedding
formed to be linked together as ever were 
box and vinegar cruet
is soon as this matter was arranged lady
lillyiaft took her leave the family at the
hall taking with her the captain and his blushing
bride who are to pass the honeymoon with
her master simon accompanied them on
horseback and indeed means to ride on a head
to make preparations the general who was
fishing in vain for an invitation to her seat
handed her ladyship into her carriage with a
heavy sigh upon which his bosom friend master
simon who was just mounting his horse
gave me a knowing wink made an abominably
wry face and leaning from his saddle whispered
loudly in my ear it wont do then putting
spurs to his horse away he cantered off
the general stood for some time waving his
hat after the carriage as it rolled down the
avenue until he was seized with a fit sneezing
from exposing his head to the cool breeze
the company have now almost all taken
their departure i have determined to do the
the wedding 
same tomorrow morning and i hope my reader
may not think that i have already lingered too
long at the ball i have been tempted to do so
however because i thought i had lit upon one
 the retired places where there are yet some
traces to be met with old english character
a little while hence and all these will have
passed away
ready money jack will sleep with his fathers
the good squire and all his peculiarities
will be buried in the parish church the old
hall will be modernized into a fashionable
country seat or pera venture a manufactory
the park will be cut up into kitchen gardens
a daily coach will run through the village and
it will become like all other commonplace villages
thronged with coachmen postboys tipplers
and politicians and christmas mayday
and all their hearty merrymakings will be
forgotten 

the sketch book

the author's account of himself

i am of this mind with homer that as the snaile that crept out of her
shel was turned eftsoones into a toad i and thereby was forced to make a
stoole to sit on so the traveller that stragleth from his owne country
is in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape that he is
faine to alter his mansion with his manners and to live where he can
not where he would lyly's euphues

i was always fond of visiting new scenes and observing strange
characters and manners even when a mere child i began my travels and
made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of
my native city to the frequent alarm of my parents and the emolument
of the town crier as i grew into boyhood i extended the range of my
observations my holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the
surrounding country i made myself familiar with all its places famous
in history or fable i knew every spot where a murder or robbery had
been committed or a ghost seen i visited the neighboring villages
and added greatly to my stock of knowledge by noting their habits and
customs and conversing with their sages and great men i even journeyed
one long summer's day to the summit of the most distant hill whence i
stretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita and was astonished
to find how vast a globe i inhabited

this rambling propensity strengthened with my years books of voyages
and travels became my passion and in devouring their contents i
neglected the regular exercises of the school how wistfully would
i wander about the pier-heads in fine weather and watch the parting
ships bound to distant climes with what longing eyes would i gaze
after their lessening sails and waft myself in imagination to the ends
of the earth

further reading and thinking though they brought this vague inclination
into more reasonable bounds only served to make it more decided i
visited various parts of my own country and had i been merely a lover
of fine scenery i should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere
its gratification for on no country had the charms of nature been more
prodigally lavished her mighty lakes her oceans of liquid silver her
mountains with their bright aerial tints her valleys teeming with
wild fertility her tremendous cataracts thundering in their solitudes
her boundless plains waving with spontaneous verdure her broad deep
rivers rolling in solemn silence to the ocean her trackless forests
where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence her skies kindling
with the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine no never need
an american look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of
natural scenery

but europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical
association there were to be seen the masterpieces of art the
refinements of highly cultivated society the quaint peculiarities
of ancient and local custom my native country was full of youthful
promise europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age her very
ruins told the history of the times gone by and every mouldering
stone was a chronicle i longed to wander over the scenes of renowned
achievement to tread as it were in the footsteps of antiquity to
loiter about the ruined castle to meditate on the falling tower to
escape in short from the commonplace realities of the present and
lose myself among the shadowy grandeurs of the past

i had besides all this an earnest desire to see the great men of the
earth we have it is true our great men in america not a city but has
an ample share of them i have mingled among them in my time and been
almost withered by the shade into which they cast me for there
is nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great one
particularly the great man of a city but i was anxious to see the great
men of europe for i had read in the works of various philosophers that
all animals degenerated in america and man among the number a great
man of europe thought i must therefore be as superior to a great man
of america as a peak of the alps to a highland of the hudson and in
this idea i was confirmed by observing the comparative importance and
swelling magnitude of many english travellers among us who i was
assured were very little people in their own country i will visit this
land of wonders thought i and see the gigantic race from which i am
degenerated

it has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion
gratified i have wandered through different countries and witnessed
many of the shifting scenes of life i cannot say that i have studied
them with the eye of a philosopher but rather with the sauntering gaze
with which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll from the window
of one print-shop to another caught sometimes by the delineations of
beauty sometimes by the distortions of caricature and sometimes by
the loveliness of landscape as it is the fashion for modern tourists
to travel pencil in hand and bring home their portfolios filled with
sketches i am disposed to get up a few for the entertainment of my
friends when however i look over the hints and memorandums i have
taken down for the purpose my heart almost fails me at finding how
my idle humor has led me astray from the great object studied by every
regular traveller who would make a book i fear i shall give equal
disappointment with an unlucky landscape-painter who had travelled on
the continent but following the bent of his vagrant inclination had
sketched in nooks and corners and by-places his sketch-book was
accordingly crowded with cottages and landscapes and obscure ruins
but he had neglected to paint st peter's or the coliseum the cascade
of terni or the bay of naples and had not a single glacier or volcano
in his whole collection




the voyage

 ships ships i will descrie you
 amidst the main
 i will come and try you
 what you are protecting
 and projecting
 what's your end and aim
 one goes abroad for merchandise and trading
 another stays to keep his country from invading
 a third is coming home with rich and wealthy lading
 hallo my fancie whither wilt thou go
 old poem

to an american visiting europe the long voyage he has to make is an
excellent preparative the temporary absence of worldly scenes and
employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive
new and vivid impressions the vast space of waters that separate the
hemispheres is like a blank page in existence there is no gradual
transition by which as in europe the features and population of one
country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another from the
moment you lose sight of the land you have left all is vacancy until
you step on the opposite shore and are launched at once into the bustle
and novelties of another world

in travelling by land there is a continuity of scene and a connected
succession of persons and incidents that carry on the story of life
and lessen the effect of absence and separation we drag it is true
a lengthening chain at each remove of our pilgrimage but the chain is
unbroken we can trace it back link by link and we feel that the last
still grapples us to home but a wide sea voyage severs us at once
it makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of
settled life and sent adrift upon a doubtful world it interposes a
gulf not merely imaginary but real between us and our homes a
gulf subject to tempest and fear and uncertainty rendering distance
palpable and return precarious

such at least was the case with myself as i saw the last blue lines
of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon it seemed as if
i had closed one volume of the world and its concerns and had time for
meditation before i opened another that land too now vanishing from
my view which contained all most dear to me in life what vicissitudes
might occur in it what changes might take place in me before i should
visit it again who can tell when he sets forth to wander whither he
may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence or when he may
return or whether it may be ever his lot to revisit the scenes of his
childhood

i said that at sea all is vacancy i should correct the impression to
one given to day-dreaming and fond of losing himself in reveries a sea
voyage is full of subjects for meditation but then they are the wonders
of the deep and of the air and rather tend to abstract the mind from
worldly themes i delighted to loll over the quarter-railing or climb to
the main-top of a calm day and muse for hours together on the tranquil
bosom of a summer's sea to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just
peering above the horizon fancy them some fairy realms and people
them with a creation of my own to watch the gently undulating billows
rolling their silver volumes as if to die away on those happy shores

there was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with which i
looked down from my giddy height on the monsters of the deep at their
uncouth gambols shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship
the grampus slowly heaving his huge form above the surface or the
ravenous shark darting like a spectre through the blue waters my
imagination would conjure up all that i had heard or read of the watery
world beneath me of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys
of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the
earth and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and
sailors

sometimes a distant sail gliding along the edge of the ocean would be
another theme of idle speculation how interesting this fragment of a
world hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence what a glorious
monument of human invention which has in a manner triumphed over
wind and wave has brought the ends of the world into communion has
established an interchange of blessings pouring into the sterile
regions of the north all the luxuries of the south has diffused the
light of knowledge and the charities of cultivated life and has thus
bound together those scattered portions of the human race between which
nature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier

we one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance at
sea every thing that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse
attracts attention it proved to be the mast of a ship that must have
been completely wrecked for there were the remains of handkerchiefs by
which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar to prevent
their being washed off by the waves there was no trace by which the
name of the ship could be ascertained the wreck had evidently drifted
about for many months clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it and
long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides but where thought i is the crew
their struggle has long been over they have gone down amidst the roar
of the tempest their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep
silence oblivion like the waves have closed over them and no one
can tell the story of their end what sighs have been wafted after that
ship what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home how
often has the mistress the wife the mother pored over the daily news
to catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep how has
expectation darkened into anxiety anxiety into dread and dread into
despair alas not one memento may ever return for love to cherish all
that may ever be known is that she sailed from her port and was never
heard of more

the sight of this wreck as usual gave rise to many dismal anecdotes
this was particularly the case in the evening when the weather which
had hitherto been fair began to look wild and threatening and gave
indications of one of those sudden storms that will sometimes break in
upon the serenity of a summer voyage as we sat round the dull light of
a lamp in the cabin that made the gloom more ghastly everyone had his
tale of shipwreck and disaster i was particularly struck with a short
one related by the captain

as i was once sailing said he in a fine stout ship across the
banks of newfoundland one of those heavy fogs that prevail in those
parts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead even in the
daytime but at night the weather was so thick that we could not
distinguish any object at twice the length of the ship i kept lights
at the mast-head and a constant watch forward to look out for fishing
smacks which are accustomed to anchor of the banks the wind was
blowing a smacking breeze and we were going at a great rate through
the water suddenly the watch gave the alarm of a sail ahead it was
scarcely uttered before we were upon her she was a small schooner at
anchor with her broadside toward us the crew were all asleep and had
neglected to hoist a light we struck her just amidships the force the
size and weight of our vessel bore her down below the waves we passed
over her and were hurried on our course as the crashing wreck was
sinking beneath us i had a glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches
rushing from her cabin they just started from their beds to be
swallowed shrieking by the waves i heard their drowning cry mingling
with the wind the blast that bore it to our ears swept us out of all
further hearing i shall never forget that cry it was some time before
we could put the ship about she was under such headway we returned as
nearly as we could guess to the place where the smack had anchored we
cruised about for several hours in the dense fog we fired signal-guns
and listened if we might hear the halloo of any survivors but all was
silent we never saw or heard any thing of them more

i confess these stories for a time put an end to all my fine fancies
the storm increased with the night the sea was lashed into tremendous
confusion there was a fearful sullen sound of rushing waves and broken
surges deep called unto deep at times the black volume of clouds
overhead seemed rent asunder by flashes of lightning which quivered
along the foaming billows and made the succeeding darkness doubly
terrible the thunders bellowed over the wild waste of waters and were
echoed and prolonged by the mountain waves as i saw the ship staggering
and plunging among these roaring caverns it seemed miraculous that she
regained her balance or preserved her buoyancy her yards would dip
into the water her bow was almost buried beneath the waves sometimes
an impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm her and nothing but a
dexterous movement of the helm preserved her from the shock

when i retired to my cabin the awful scene still followed me the
whistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like funereal
wailings the creaking of the masts the straining and groaning of
bulkheads as the ship labored in the weltering sea were frightful as
i heard the waves rushing along the side of the ship and roaring in my
very ear it seemed as if death were raging around this floating prison
seeking for his prey the mere starting of a nail the yawning of a
seam might give him entrance

a fine day however with a tranquil sea and favoring breeze soon put
all these dismal reflections to flight it is impossible to resist the
gladdening influence of fine weather and fair wind at sea when the ship
is decked out in all her canvas every sail swelled and careering gayly
over the curling waves how lofty how gallant she appears how she
seems to lord it over the deep

i might fill a volume with the reveries of a sea voyage for with me it
is almost a continual reverie but it is time to get to shore

it was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of land was given
from the mast-head none but those who have experienced it can form an
idea of the delicious throng of sensations which rush into an american's
bosom when he first comes in sight of europe there is a volume of
associations with the very name it is the land of promise teeming with
everything of which his childhood has heard or on which his studious
years have pondered

from that time until the moment of arrival it was all feverish
excitement the ships of war that prowled like guardian giants along
the coast the headlands of ireland stretching out into the channel
the welsh mountains towering into the clouds all were objects of
intense interest as we sailed up the mersey i reconnoitred the shores
with a telescope my eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages with their
trim shrubberies and green grass-plots i saw the mouldering ruin of an
abbey overrun with ivy and the taper spire of a village church rising
from the brow of a neighboring hill all were characteristic of
england

the tide and wind were so favorable that the ship was enabled to come
at once to her pier it was thronged with people some idle lookers-on
others eager expectants of friends or relations i could distinguish
the merchant to whom the ship was consigned i knew him by his
calculating brow and restless air his hands were thrust into his
pockets he was whistling thoughtfully and walking to and fro a
small space having been accorded him by the crowd in deference to his
temporary importance there were repeated cheerings and salutations
interchanged between the shore and the ship as friends happened to
recognize each other i particularly noticed one young woman of humble
dress but interesting demeanor she was leaning forward from among the
crowd her eye hurried over the ship as it neared the shore to catch
some wished-for countenance she seemed disappointed and sad when i
heard a faint voice call her name it was from a poor sailor who had
been ill all the voyage and had excited the sympathy of every one on
board when the weather was fine his messmates had spread a mattress
for him on deck in the shade but of late his illness had so increased
that he had taken to his hammock and only breathed a wish that he might
see his wife before he died he had been helped on deck as we came up
the river and was now leaning against the shrouds with a countenance
so wasted so pale so ghastly that it was no wonder even the eye of
affection did not recognize him but at the sound of his voice her eye
darted on his features it read at once a whole volume of sorrow she
clasped her hands uttered a faint shriek and stood wringing them in
silent agony

all now was hurry and bustle the meetings of acquaintances the
greetings of friends the consultations of men of business i alone was
solitary and idle i had no friend to meet no cheering to receive i
stepped upon the land of my forefathers but felt that i was a stranger
in the land




roscoe

 in the service of mankind to be
 a guardian god below still to employ
 the mind's brave ardor in heroic aims
 such as may raise us o'er the grovelling herd
 and make us shine for ever that is life
 thomson

one of the first places to which a stranger is taken in liverpool is
the athenaeum it is established on a liberal and judicious plan it
contains a good library and spacious reading-room and is the great
literary resort of the place go there at what hour you may you are
sure to find it filled with grave-looking personages deeply absorbed in
the study of newspapers

as i was once visiting this haunt of the learned my attention was
attracted to a person just entering the room he was advanced in life
tall and of a form that might once have been commanding but it was
a little bowed by time perhaps by care he had a noble roman style of
countenance a a head that would have pleased a painter and though some
slight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought had been busy
there yet his eye beamed with the fire of a poetic soul there was
something in his whole appearance that indicated a being of a different
order from the bustling race round him

i inquired his name and was informed that it was roscoe i drew back
with an involuntary feeling of veneration this then was an author of
celebrity this was one of those men whose voices have gone forth to
the ends of the earth with whose minds i have communed even in the
solitudes of america accustomed as we are in our country to know
european writers only by their works we cannot conceive of them as of
other men engrossed by trivial or sordid pursuits and jostling with
the crowd of common minds in the dusty paths of life they pass before
our imaginations like superior beings radiant with the emanations of
their genius and surrounded by a halo of literary glory

to find therefore the elegant historian of the medici mingling among
the busy sons of traffic at first shocked my poetical ideas but it is
from the very circumstances and situation in which he has been placed
that mr roscoe derives his highest claims to admiration it is
interesting to notice how some minds seem almost to create themselves
springing up under every disadvantage and working their solitary but
irresistible way through a thousand obstacles nature seems to delight
in disappointing the assiduities of art with which it would rear
legitimate dulness to maturity and to glory in the vigor and luxuriance
of her chance productions she scatters the seeds of genius to the
winds and though some may perish among the stony places of the world
and some be choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity yet
others will now and then strike root even in the clefts of the rock
struggle bravely up into sunshine and spread over their sterile
birthplace all the beauties of vegetation

such has been the case with mr roscoe born in a place apparently
ungenial to the growth of literary talent in the very market-place of
trade without fortune family connections or patronage self-prompted
self-sustained and almost self-taught he has conquered every obstacle
achieved his way to eminence and having become one of the ornaments of
the nation has turned the whole force of his talents and influence to
advance and embellish his native town

indeed it is this last trait in his character which has given him the
greatest interest in my eyes and induced me particularly to point him
out to my countrymen eminent as are his literary merits he is but one
among the many distinguished authors of this intellectual nation
they however in general live but for their own fame or their own
pleasures their private history presents no lesson to the world or
perhaps a humiliating one of human frailty or inconsistency at best
they are prone to steal away from the bustle and commonplace of busy
existence to indulge in the selfishness of lettered eas and to revel
in scenes of mental but exclusive enjoyment

mr roscoe on the contrary has claimed none of the accorded privileges
of talent he has shut himself up in no garden of thought nor elysium
of fancy but has gone forth into the highways and thoroughfares of
life he has planted bowers by the wayside for the refreshment of the
pilgrim and the sojourner and has opened pure fountains where the
laboring man may turn aside from the dust and heat of the day and drink
of the living streams of knowledge there is a daily beauty in his
life on which mankind may meditate and grow better it exhibits no
lofty and almost useless because inimitable example of excellence but
presents a picture of active yet simple and imitable virtues which are
within every man's reach but which unfortunately are not exercised by
many or this world would be a paradise

but his private life is peculiarly worthy the attention of the citizens
of our young and busy country where literature and the elegant arts
must grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily necessity
and must depend for their culture not on the exclusive devotion of time
and wealth nor the quickening rays of titled patronage but on
hours and seasons snatched from the purest of worldly interests by
intelligent and public-spirited individuals

he has shown how much may be done for a place in hours of leisure by
one master-spirit and how completely it can give its own impress to
surrounding objects like his own lorenzo de medici on whom he
seems to have fixed his eye as on a pure model of antiquity he has
interwoven the history of his life with the history of his native town
and has made the foundations of his fame the monuments of his virtues
wherever you go in liverpool you perceive traces of his footsteps in
all that is elegant and liberal he found the tide of wealth flowing
merely in the channels of traffic he has diverted from it invigorating
rills to refresh the garden of literature by his own example and
constant exertions he has effected that union of commerce and the
intellectual pursuits so eloquently recommended in one of his latest
writings and has practically proved how beautifully they may be
brought to harmonize and to benefit each other the noble institutions
for literary and scientific purposes which reflect such credit on
liverpool and are giving such an impulse to the public mind have
mostly been originated and have all been effectively promoted by
mr roscoe and when we consider the rapidly increasing opulence and
magnitude of that town which promises to vie in commercial importance
with the metropolis it will be perceived that in awakening an ambition
of mental improvement among its inhabitants he has effected a great
benefit to the cause of british literature


 address on the opening of the liverpool institution


in america we know mr roscoe only as the author in liverpool he is
spoken of as the banker and i was told of his having been unfortunate
in business i could not pity him as i heard some rich men do i
considered him far above the reach of pity those who live only for the
world and in the world may be cast down by the frowns of adversity
but a man like roscoe is not to be overcome by the reverses of fortune
they do but drive him in upon the resources of his own mind to the
superior society of his own thoughts which the best of men are apt
sometimes to neglect and to roam abroad in search of less worthy
associates he is independent of the world around him he lives with
antiquity and with posterity with antiquity in the sweet communion of
studious retirement and with posterity in the generous aspirings
after future renown the solitude of such a mind is its state of highest
enjoyment it is then visited by those elevated meditations which
are the proper aliment of noble souls and are like manna sent from
heaven in the wilderness of this world

while my feelings were yet alive on the subject it was my fortune
to light on further traces of mr roscoe i was riding out with a
gentleman to view the environs of liverpool when he turned off
through a gate into some ornamented grounds after riding a short
distance we came to a spacious mansion of freestone built in the
grecian style it was not in the purest style yet it had an air of
elegance and the situation was delightful a fine lawn sloped away from
it studded with clumps of trees so disposed as to break a soft fertile
country into a variety of landscapes the mersey was seen winding a
broad quiet sheet of water through an expanse of green meadow land
while the welsh mountains blended with clouds and melting into
distance bordered the horizon

this was roscoe's favorite residence during the days of his prosperity
it had been the seat of elegant hospitality and literary retirement the
house was now silent and deserted i saw the windows of the study which
looked out upon the soft scenery i have mentioned the windows were
closed the library was gone two or three ill-favored beings were
loitering about the place whom my fancy pictured into retainers of the
law it was like visiting some classic fountain that had once welled
its pure waters in a sacred shade but finding it dry and dusty with
the lizard and the toad brooding over the shattered marbles

i inquired after the fate of mr roscoe's library which had consisted
of scarce and foreign books from many of which he had drawn the
materials for his italian histories it had passed under the hammer of
the auctioneer and was dispersed about the country the good people
of the vicinity thronged liked wreckers to get some part of the
noble vessel that had been driven on shore did such a scene admit of
ludicrous associations we might imagine something whimsical in this
strange irruption in the regions of learning pigmies rummaging the
armory of a giant and contending for the possession of weapons which
they could not wield we might picture to ourselves some knot of
speculators debating with calculating brow over the quaint binding and
illuminated margin of an obsolete author of the air of intense but
baffled sagacity with which some successful purchaser attempted to dive
into the black-letter bargain he had secured

it is a beautiful incident in the story of mr roscoe's misfortunes and
one which cannot fail to interest the studious mind that the parting
with his books seems to have touched upon his tenderest feelings and
to have been the only circumstance that could provoke the notice of
his muse the scholar only knows how dear these silent yet eloquent
companions of pure thoughts and innocent hours become in the season of
adversity when all that is worldly turns to dross around us these only
retain their steady value when friends grow cold and the converse of
intimates languishes into vapid civility and commonplace these only
continue the unaltered countenance of happier days and cheer us with
that true friendship which never deceived hope nor deserted sorrow

i do not wish to censure but surely if the people of liverpool had
been properly sensible of what was due to mr roscoe and themselves his
library would never have been sold good worldly reasons may doubtless
be given for the circumstance which it would be difficult to combat
with others that might seem merely fanciful but it certainly appears
to me such an opportunity as seldom occurs of cheering a noble mind
struggling under misfortunes by one of the most delicate but most
expressive tokens of public sympathy it is difficult however to
estimate a man of genius properly who is daily before our eyes he
becomes mingled and confounded with other men his great qualities lose
their novelty we become too familiar with the common materials which
form the basis even of the loftiest character some of mr roscoe's
townsmen may regard him merely as a man of business others as
a politician all find him engaged like themselves in ordinary
occupations and surpassed perhaps by themselves on some points of
worldly wisdom even that amiable and unostentatious simplicity of
character which gives the nameless grace to real excellence may cause
him to be undervalued by some coarse minds who do not know that true
worth is always void of glare and pretension but the man of letters
who speaks of liverpool speaks of it as the residence of roscoe the
intelligent traveller who visits it inquires where roscoe is to be seen
he is the literary landmark of the place indicating its existence to
the distant scholar he is like pompey's column at alexandria towering
alone in classic dignity

the following sonnet addressed by mr roscoe to his books on parting
with them has already been alluded to if anything can add effect
to the pure feeling and elevated thought here displayed it is the
conviction that the who leis no effusion of fancy but a faithful
transcript from the writer's heart

 to my books

 as one who destined from his friends to part
 regrets his loss but hopes again erewhile
 to share their converse and enjoy their smile
 and tempers as he may affliction's dart

 thus loved associates chiefs of elder art
 teachers of wisdom who could once beguile
 my tedious hours and lighten every toil
 i now resign you nor with fainting heart

 for pass a few short years or days or hours
 and happier seasons may their dawn unfold
 and all your sacred fellowship restore
 when freed from earth unlimited its powers
 mind shall with mind direct communion hold
 and kindred spirits meet to part no more




the wife

 the treasures of the deep are not so precious
 as are the concealed comforts of a man
 lock'd up in woman's love i scent the air
 of blessings when i came but near the house
 what a delicious breath marriage sends forth 
 the violet bed's no sweeter
 middleton

i have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women
sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune those disasters which
break down the spirit of a man and prostrate him in the dust seem to
call forth all the energies of the softer sex and give such intrepidity
and elevation to their character that at times it approaches to
sublimity nothing can be more touching than to behold a soft and
tender female who had been all weakness and dependence and alive to
every trivial roughness while threading the prosperous paths of life
suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and support of her
husband under misfortune and abiding with unshrinking firmness the
bitterest blasts of adversity

as the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak
and been lifted by it into sunshine will when the hardy plant is
rifted by the thunderbolt cling round it with its caressing tendrils
and bind up its shattered boughs so is it beautifully ordered by
providence that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man
in his happier hours should be his stay and solace when smitten with
sudden calamity winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature
tenderly supporting the drooping head and binding up the broken heart

i was once congratulating a friend who had around him a blooming
family knit together in the strongest affection i can wish you
no better lot said he with enthusiasm than to have a wife
and children if you are prosperous there they are to share your
prosperity if otherwise there they are to comfort you and indeed i
have observed that a married man falling into misfortune is more apt to
retrieve his situation in the world than a single one partly because
he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and
beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence but chiefly because
his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments and his
self-respect kept alive by finding that though all abroad is darkness
and humiliation yet there is still a little world of love at home of
which he is the monarch whereas a single man is apt to run to waste
and self-neglect to fancy himself lonely and abandoned and his heart
to fall to ruin like some deserted mansion for want of an inhabitant

these observations call to mind a little domestic story of which i was
once a witness my intimate friend leslie had married a beautiful and
accomplished girl who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable
life she had it is true no fortune but that of my friend was ample
and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in every elegant
pursuit and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that
spread a kind of witchery about the sex her life said he shall be
like a fairy tale

the very difference in their characters produced a harmonious
combination he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast she was
all life and gladness i have often noticed the mute rapture with which
he would gaze upon her in company of which her sprightly powers made
her the delight and how in the midst of applause her eye would still
turn to him as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance when
leaning on his arm her slender form contrasted finely with his tall
manly person the fond confiding air with which she looked up to
him seemed to call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing
tenderness as if he doated on his lovely burden from its very
helplessness never did a couple set forward on the flowery path of
early and well-suited marriage with a fairer prospect of felicity

it was the misfortune of my friend however to have embarked his
property in large speculations and he had not been married many months
when by a succession of sudden disasters it was swept from him and he
found himself reduced to almost penury for a time he kept his situation
to himself and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking
heart his life was but a protracted agony and what rendered it more
insupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence of
his wife for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the news
she saw however with the quick eyes of affection that all was not
well with him she marked his altered looks and stifled sighs and was
not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness she
tasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him back
to happiness but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul the
more he saw cause to love her the more torturing was the thought that
he was soon to make her wretched a little while thought he and the
smile will vanish from that cheek the song will die away from those
lips the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow and the
happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down
like mine by the cares and miseries of the world

at length he came to me one day and related his whole situation in a
tone of the deepest despair when i had heard him through i inquired
does your wife know all this at the question he burst into an agony
of tears for god's sake cried he if you have any pity on me don't
mention my wife it is the thought of her that drives me almost to
madness

and why not said i she must know it sooner or later you cannot
keep it long from her and the intelligence may break upon her in a more
startling manner than if imparted by yourself for the accents of those
we love soften the harshest tidings besides you are depriving
yourself of the comforts of her sympathy and not merely that but also
endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together an unreserved
community of thought and feeling she will soon perceive that something
is secretly preying upon your mind and true love will not brook
reserve it feels undervalued and outraged when even the sorrows of
those it loves are concealed from it

oh but my friend to think what a blow i am to give to all her future
prospects how i am to strike her very soul to the earth by telling
her that her husband is a beggar that she is to forego all the
elegancies of life all the pleasures of society to shrink with me into
indigence and obscurity to tell her that i have dragged her down
from the sphere in which she might have continued to move in constant
brightness the light of every eye the admiration of every heart how
can she bear poverty she has been brought up in all the refinements of
opulence how can she bear neglect she has been the idol of society
oh it will break her heart it will break her heart

i saw his grief was eloquent and i let it have its flow for sorrow
relieves itself by words when his paroxysm had subsided and he had
relapsed into moody silence i resumed the subject gently and urged
him to break his situation at once to his wife he shook his head
mournfully but positively

but how are you to keep it from her it is necessary she should
know it that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your
circumstances you must change your style of living nay observing a
pang to pass across his countenance don't let that afflict you i am
sure you have never placed your happiness in outward show you have yet
friends warm friends who will not think the worse of you for being
less splendidly lodged and surely it does not require a palace to be
happy with mary 

i could be happy with her cried he convulsively in a hovel i
could go down with her into poverty and the dust i could i could god
bless her god bless her cried he bursting into a transport of grief
and tenderness

and believe me my friend said i stepping up and grasping him
warmly by the hand believe me she can be the same with you ay more
it will be a source of pride and triumph to her it will call forth all
the latent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature for she will
rejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself there is in every true
woman's heart a spark of heavenly fire which lies dormant in the broad
daylight of prosperity but which kindles up and beams and blazes
in the dark hour of adversity no man knows what the wife of his bosom
is no man knows what a ministering angel she is until he has gone with
her through the fiery trials of this world

there was something in the earnestness of my manner and the figurative
style of my language that caught the excited imagination of leslie i
knew the auditor i had to deal with and following up the impression i
had made i finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad
heart to his wife

i must confess notwithstanding all i had said i felt some little
solicitude for the result who can calculate on the fortitude of one
whose life has been a round of pleasures her gay spirits might revolt
at the dark downward path of low humility suddenly pointed out before
her and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto
revelled besides ruin in fashionable life is accompanied by so many
galling mortifications to which in other ranks it is a stranger in
short i could not meet leslie the next morning without trepidation
he had made the disclosure

and how did she bear it

like an angel it seemed rather to be a relief to her mind for she
threw her arms around my neck and asked if this was all that had lately
made me unhappy but poor girl added he she cannot realize the
change we must undergo she has no idea of poverty but in the abstract
she has only read of it in poetry where it is allied to love she feels
as yet no privation she suffers no loss of accustomed conveniences nor
elegancies when we come practically to experience its sordid cares its
paltry wants its petty humiliations then will be the real trial

but said i now that you have got over the severest task that of
breaking it to her the sooner you let the world into the secret the
better the disclosure may be mortifying but then it is a single
misery and soon over whereas you otherwise suffer it in anticipation
every hour in the day it is not poverty so much as pretence that
harasses a ruined man the struggle between a proud mind and an empty
purse-the keeping up a hollow show that must soon come to an end have
the courage to appear poor and you disarm poverty of its sharpest
sting on this point i found leslie perfectly prepared he had no false
pride himself and as to his wife she was only anxious to conform to
their altered fortunes

some days afterwards he called upon me in the evening he had disposed
of his dwelling-house and taken a small cottage in the country a few
miles from town he had been busied all day in sending out furniture
the new establishment required few articles and those of the simplest
kind all the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold
excepting his wife's harp that he said was too closely associated
with the idea of herself it belonged to the little story of their loves
for some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he
had leaned over that instrument and listened to the melting tones of
her voice i could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry
in a doating husband

he was now going out to the cottage where his wife had been all
day superintending its arrangement my feelings had become strongly
interested in the progress of his family story and as it was a fine
evening i offered to accompany him

he was wearied with the fatigues of the day and as we walked out fell
into a fit of gloomy musing

poor mary at length broke with a heavy sigh from his lips

and what of her asked i has anything happened to her

what said he darting an impatient glance is it nothing to be
reduced to this paltry situation to be caged in a miserable cottage to
be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched
habitation

has she then repined at the change

repined she has been nothing but sweetness and good-humor indeed she
seems in better spirits than i have ever known her she has been to me
all love and tenderness and comfort

admirable girl exclaimed i you call yourself poor my friend
you never were so rich you never knew the boundless treasures of
excellence you possessed in that woman

oh but my friend if this first meeting at the cottage were over
i think i could then be comfortable but this is her first day of real
experience she has been introduced into a humble dwelling she has
been employed all day in arranging its miserable equipments she has
for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment she has
for the first time looked around her on a home destitute of every thing
elegant almost of every thing convenient and may now be sitting down
exhausted and spiritless brooding over a prospect of future poverty

there was a degree of probability in this picture that i could not
gainsay so we walked on in silence

after turning from the main road up a narrow lane so thickly shaded
with forest-trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion we came
in sight of the cottage it was humble enough in its appearance for the
most pastoral poet and yet it had a pleasing rural look a wild vine
had overrun one end with a profusion of foliage a few trees threw their
branches gracefully over it and i observed several pots of flowers
tastefully disposed about the door and on the grass-plot in front
a small wicket-gate opened upon a footpath that wound through some
shrubbery to the door just as we approached we heard the sound of
music leslie grasped my arm we paused and listened it was mary's
voice singing in a style of the most touching simplicity a little air
of which her husband was peculiarly fond

i felt leslie's hand tremble on my arm he stepped forward to hear more
distinctly his step made a noise on the gravel-walk a bright beautiful
face glanced out at the window and vanished a light footstep-was
heard and mary came tripping forth to meet us she was in a pretty
rural dress of white a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine
hair a fresh bloom was on her cheek her whole countenance beamed with
smiles i had never seen her look so lovely

my dear george cried she i am so glad you are come i have been
watching and watching for you and running down the lane and looking
out for you i've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind
the cottage and i've been gathering some of the most delicious
strawberries for i know you are fond of them and we have such
excellent cream and everything is so sweet and still here-oh said
she putting her arm within his and looking up brightly in his face
oh we shall be so happy

poor leslie was overcome he caught her to his bosom he folded his
arms round her he kissed her again and again he could not speak but
the tears gushed into his eyes and he has often assured me that
though the world has since gone prosperously with him and his life has
indeed been a happy one yet never has he experienced a moment of more
exquisite felicity




rip van winkle

a posthumous writing of diedrich knickerbocker

 by woden god of saxons
 from whence comes wensday that is wodensday
 truth is a thing that ever i will keep
 unto thylke day in which i creep into
 my sepulchre 
 cartwright

the following tale was found among the papers of the late diedrich
knickerbocker an old gentleman of new york who was very curious in the
dutch history of the province and the manners of the descendants from
its primitive settlers his historical researches however did not lie
so much among books as among men for the former are lamentably scanty
on his favorite topics whereas he found the old burghers and still
more their wives rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true
history whenever therefore he happened upon a genuine dutch family
snugly shut up in its low-roofed farm-house under a spreading sycamore
he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter and
studied it with the zeal of a bookworm

the result of all these researches was a history of the province during
the reign of the dutch governors which he published some years since
there have been various opinions as to the literary character of his
work and to tell the truth it is not a whit better than it should be
its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy which indeed was a little
questioned on its first appearance but has since been completely
established and it is now admitted into all historical collections as
a book of unquestionable authority

the old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work and
now that he is dead and gone it cannot do much harm to his memory to
say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier
labors he however was apt to ride his hobby his own way and though
it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his
neighbors and grieve the spirit of some friends for whom he felt
the truest deference and affection yet his errors and follies
are remembered more in sorrow than in anger and it begins to be
suspected that he never intended to injure or offend but however his
memory may be appreciated by critics it is still held dear among many
folks whose good opinion is well worth having particularly by certain
biscuit-bakers who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their
new-year cakes and have thus given him a chance for immortality
almost equal to the being stamped on a waterloo medal or a queen anne's
farthing


whoever has made a voyage up the hudson must remember the kaatskill
mountains they are a dismembered branch of the great appalachian
family and are seen away to the west of the river swelling up to a
noble height and lording it over the surrounding country every change
of season every change of weather indeed every hour of the day
produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains
and they are regarded by all the good wives far and near as perfect
barometers when the weather is fair and settled they are clothed in
blue and purple and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky
but sometimes when the rest of the landscape is cloudless they will
gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits which in the last
rays of the setting sun will glow and light up like a crown of glory

at the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may have descried the
light smoke curling up from a village whose shingle roofs gleam among
the trees just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the
fresh green of the nearer landscape it is a little village of great
antiquity having been founded by some of the dutch colonists in the
early times of the province just about the beginning of the government
of the good peter stuyvesant may he rest in peace and there were
some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years
built of small yellow bricks brought from holland having latticed
windows and gable fronts surmounted with weathercocks

in that same village and in one of these very houses which to tell
the precise truth was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten there lived
many years since while the country was yet a province of great britain
a simple good-natured fellow of the name of rip van winkle he was a
descendant of the van winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous
days of peter stuyvesant and accompanied him to the siege of fort
christina he inherited however but little of the martial character of
his ancestors i have observed that he was a simple good-natured man
he was moreover a kind neighbor and an obedient henpecked husband
indeed to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of
spirit which gained him such universal popularity for those men are apt
to be obsequious and conciliating abroad who are under the discipline
of shrews at home their tempers doubtless are rendered pliant
and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation and a
curtain-lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the
virtues of patience and long-suffering a termagant wife may therefore
in some respects be considered a tolerable blessing and if so rip van
winkle was thrice blessed

certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of
the village who as usual with the amiable sex took his part in all
family squabbles and never failed whenever they talked those matters
over in their evening gossipings to lay all the blame on dame van
winkle the children of the village too would shout with joy whenever
he approached he assisted at their sports made their playthings
taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles and told them long stories
of ghosts witches and indians whenever he went dodging about the
village he was surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts
clambering on his back and playing a thousand tricks on him with
impunity and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood

the great error in rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to
all kinds of profitable labor it could not be for want of assiduity
or perseverance for he would sit on a wet rock with a rod as long
and heavy as a tartar's lance and fish all day without a murmur even
though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble he would carry
a fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours together trudging through
woods and swamps and up hill and down dale to shoot a few squirrels
or wild pigeons he would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the
roughest toil and was a foremost man in all country frolics for husking
indian corn or building stone fences the women of the village too
used to employ him to run their errands and to do such little odd jobs
as their less obliging husbands would not do for them in a word rip
was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own but as to doing
family duty and keeping his farm in order he found it impossible

in fact he declared it was of no use to work on his farm it was the
most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country everything
about it went wrong in spite of him his fences were continually
falling to pieces his cow would either go astray or get among the
cabbages weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere
else the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some
out-door work to do so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled
away under his management acre by acre until there was little more
left than a mere patch of indian corn and potatoes yet it was the
worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood

his children too were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to
nobody his son rip an urchin begotten in his own likeness promised
to inherit the habits with the old clothes of his father he was
generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels equipped in
a pair of his father's cast-off galligaskins which he had much ado to
hold up with one hand as a fine lady does her train in bad weather

rip van winkle however was one of those happy mortals of foolish
well-oiled dispositions who take the world easy eat white bread or
brown whichever can be got with least thought or trouble and would
rather starve on a penny than work for a pound if left to himself he
would have whistled life away in perfect contentment but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness his carelessness
and the ruin he was bringing on his family morning noon and night
her tongue was incessantly going and every thing he said or did was
sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence rip had but one way
of replying to all lectures of the kind and that by frequent use had
grown into a habit he shrugged his shoulders shook his head cast
up his eyes but said nothing this however always provoked a fresh
volley from his wife so that he was fain to draw off his forces and
take to the outside of the house the only side which in truth belongs
to a henpecked husband

rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog wolf who was as much henpecked
as his master for dame van winkle regarded them as companions in
idleness and even looked upon wolf with an evil eye as the cause of
his master's going so often astray true it is in all points of spirit
befitting in honorable dog he was as courageous an animal as ever
scoured the woods but what courage can withstand the evil-doing and
all-besetting terrors of a woman's tongue the moment wolf entered the
house his crest fell his tail drooped to the ground or curled between
his legs he sneaked about with a gallows air casting many a sidelong
glance at dame van winkle and at the least flourish of a broomstick or
ladle he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation

times grew worse and worse with rip van winkle as years of matrimony
rolled on a tart temper never mellows with age and a sharp tongue
is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use for a long
while he used to console himself when driven from home by frequenting
a kind of perpetual club of the sages philosophers and other idle
personages of the village which held its sessions on a bench before a
small inn designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty george the
third here they used to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer's
day talking listlessly over village gossip or telling endless sleepy
stories about nothing but it would have been worth any statesman's
money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place
when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing
traveller how solemnly they would listen to the contents as drawled
out by derrick van bummel the school-master a dapper learned little
man who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the
dictionary and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some
months after they had taken place

the opinions of this junto were completely controlled by nicholas
vedder a patriarch of the village and landlord of the inn at the
door of which he took his seat from morning till night just moving
sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree so
that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as
by a sun-dial it is true he was rarely heard to speak but smoked his
pipe incessantly his adherents however for every great man has
his adherents perfectly understood him and knew how to gather his
opinions when any thing that was read or related displeased him he was
observed to smoke his pipe vehemently and to send forth frequent
and angry puffs but when pleased he would inhale the smoke slowly
and tranquilly and emit it in light and placid clouds and sometimes
taking the pipe from his mouth and letting the fragrant vapor
curl about his nose would gravely nod his head in token of perfect
approbation

from even this stronghold the unlucky rip was at length routed by his
termagant wife who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of
the assemblage and call the members all to nought nor was that august
personage nicholas vedder himself sacred from the daring tongue of
this terrible virago who charged him outright with encouraging her
husband in habits of idleness

poor rip was at last reduced almost to despair and his only
alternative to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his
wife was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods here
he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree and share
the contents of his wallet with wolf with whom he sympathized as a
fellow-sufferer in persecution poor wolf he would say thy mistress
leads thee a dog's life of it but never mind my lad whilst i live
thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee wolf would wag his
tail look wistfully in his master's face and if dogs can feel pity i
verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart

in a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day rip had
unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the kaatskill
mountains he was after his favorite sport of squirrel-shooting and the
still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun
panting and fatigued he threw himself late in the afternoon on a
green knoll covered with mountain herbage that crowned the brow of a
precipice from an opening between the trees he could overlook all the
lower country for many a mile of rich woodland he saw at a distance
the lordly hudson far far below him moving on its silent but majestic
course with the reflection of a purple cloud or the sail of a lagging
bark here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom and at last losing
itself in the blue highlands

on the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen wild
lonely and shagged the bottom filled with fragments from the impending
cliffs and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting
sun for some time rip lay musing on this scene evening was gradually
advancing the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over
the valleys he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the
village and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the
terrors of dame van winkle

as he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing
rip van winkle rip van winkle he looked around but could see
nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain he
thought his fancy must have deceived him and turned again to descend
when he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air rip van
winkle rip van winkle at the same time wolf bristled up his back
and giving a low growl skulked to his master's side looking fearfully
down into the glen rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over
him he looked anxiously in the same direction and perceived a strange
figure slowly toiling up the rocks and bending under the weight of
something he carried on his back he was surprised to see any human
being in this lonely and unfrequented place but supposing it to be some
one of the neighborhood in need of his assistance he hastened down to
yield it

on nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of
the stranger's appearance he was a short square-built old fellow with
thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard his dress was of the antique
dutch fashion a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist several pairs of
breeches the outer one of ample volume decorated with rows of buttons
down the sides and bunches at the knees he bore on his shoulders
a stout keg that seemed full of liquor and made signs for rip to
approach and assist him with the load though rather shy and distrustful
of this new acquaintance rip complied with his usual alacrity and
mutually relieving each other they clambered up a narrow gully
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent as they ascended rip
every now and then heard long rolling peals like distant thunder that
seemed to issue out of a deep ravine or rather cleft between lofty
rocks toward which their rugged path conducted he paused for an
instant but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient
thunder-showers which often take place in the mountain heights he
proceeded passing through the ravine they came to a hollow like a
small amphitheatre surrounded by perpendicular precipices over the
brinks of which impending trees shot their branches so that you only
caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud during
the whole time rip and his companion had labored on in silence for
though the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying
a keg of liquor up this wild mountain yet there was something strange
and incomprehensible about the unknown that inspired awe and checked
familiarity

on entering the amphitheatre new objects of wonder presented
themselves on a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking
personages playing at ninepins they were dressed in quaint outlandish
fashion some wore short doublets others jerkins with long knives in
their belts and most of them had enormous breeches of similar style
with that of the guide's their visages too were peculiar one had
a large head broad face and small piggish eyes the face of another
seemed to consist entirely of nose and was surmounted by a white
sugar-loaf hat set off with a little red cock's tail they all had
beards of various shapes and colors there was one who seemed to be
the commander he was a stout old gentleman with a weather-beaten
countenance he wore a laced doublet broad belt and hanger
high-crowned hat and feather red stockings and high-heeled shoes with
roses in them the whole group reminded rip of the figures in an old
flemish painting in the parlor of dominie van schaick the village
parson and which had been brought over from holland at the time of the
settlement

what seemed particularly odd to rip was that though these folks were
evidently amusing themselves yet they maintained the gravest faces the
most mysterious silence and were withal the most melancholy party of
pleasure he had ever witnessed nothing interrupted the stillness of
the scene but the noise of the balls which whenever they were rolled
echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder

as rip and his companion approached them they suddenly desisted from
their play and stared at him with such a fixed statue-like gaze and
such strange uncouth lack-lustre countenances that his heart turned
within him and his knees smote together his companion now emptied the
contents of the keg into large flagons and made signs to him to wait
upon the company he obeyed with fear and trembling they quaffed the
liquor in profound silence and then returned to their game

by degrees rip's awe and apprehension subsided he even ventured when
no eye was fixed upon him to taste the beverage which he found had much
of the flavor of excellent hollands he was naturally a thirsty soul
and was soon tempted to repeat the draught one taste provoked another
and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often that at length his
senses were overpowered his eyes swam in his head his head gradually
declined and he fell into a deep sleep

on waking he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first
seen the old man of the glen he rubbed his eyes it was a bright sunny
morning the birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes and
the eagle was wheeling aloft and breasting the pure mountain breeze
surely thought rip i have not slept here all night he recalled
the occurrences before he fell asleep the strange man with the keg
of liquor the mountain ravine the wild retreat among the rocks the
woe-begone party at ninepins the flagon oh that flagon that wicked
flagon thought rip what excuse shall i make to dame van winkle

he looked round for his gun but in place of the clean well-oiled
fowling-piece he found an old firelock lying by him the barrel
encrusted with rust the lock falling off and the stock worm-eaten he
now suspected that the grave roysterers of the mountains had put a trick
upon him and having dosed him with liquor had robbed him of his
gun wolf too had disappeared but he might have strayed away after a
squirrel or partridge he whistled after him and shouted his name but
all in vain the echoes repeated his whistle and shout but no dog was
to be seen

he determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol and if
he met with any of the party to demand his dog and gun as he rose to
walk he found himself stiff in the joints and wanting in his usual
activity these mountain beds do not agree with me thought rip and
if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism i shall
have a blessed time with dame van winkle with some difficulty he got
down into the glen he found the gully up which he and his companion
had ascended the preceding evening but to his astonishment a mountain
stream was now foaming down it leaping from rock to rock and filling
the glen with babbling murmurs he however made shift to scramble
up its sides working his toilsome way through thickets of birch
sassafras and witch-hazel and sometimes tripped up or entangled by
the wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to
tree and spread a kind of network in his path

at length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs
to the amphitheatre but no traces of such opening remained the rocks
presented a high impenetrable wall over which the torrent came tumbling
in a sheet of feathery foam and fell into a broad deep basin black
from the shadows of the surrounding forest here then poor rip was
brought to a stand he again called and whistled after his dog he was
only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows sporting high
in the air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice and who
secure in their elevation seemed to look down and scoff at the poor
man's perplexities what was to be done the morning was passing away
and rip felt famished for want of his breakfast he grieved to give up
his dog and gun he dreaded to meet his wife but it would not do to
starve among the mountains he shook his head shouldered the rusty
firelock and with a heart full of trouble and anxiety turned his
steps homeward

as he approached the village he met a number of people but none
whom he new which somewhat surprised him for he had thought himself
acquainted with every one in the country round their dress too was
of a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed they all
stared at him with equal marks of surprise and whenever they cast eyes
upon him invariably stroked their chins the constant recurrence of
this gesture induced rip involuntarily to do the same when to his
astonishment he found his beard had grown a foot long

he had now entered the skirts of the village a troop of strange
children ran at his heels hooting after him and pointing at his
gray beard the dogs too not one of which he recognized for an old
acquaintance barked at him as he passed the very village was altered
it was larger and more populous there were rows of houses which he
had never seen before and those which had been his familiar haunts had
disappeared strange names were over the doors strange faces at the
windows everything was strange his mind now misgave him he began
to doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched
surely this was his native village which he had left but a day before
there stood the kaatskill mountains there ran the silver hudson at
a distance there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always
been rip was sorely perplexed that flagon last night thought he
has addled my poor head sadly

it was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house
which he approached with silent awe expecting every moment to hear the
shrill voice of dame van winkle he found the house gone to decay the
roof had fallen in the windows shattered and the doors off the hinges
a half-starved dog that looked like wolf was skulking about it rip
called him by name but the cur snarled showed his teeth and passed
on this was an unkind cut indeed my very dog sighed poor rip has
forgotten me

he entered the house which to tell the truth dame van winkle had
always kept in neat order it was empty forlorn and apparently
abandoned this desolateness overcame all his connubial fears he called
loudly for his wife and children the lonely chambers rang for a moment
with his voice and then all again was silence

he now hurried forth and hastened to his old resort the village
inn but it too was gone a large rickety wooden building stood in its
place with great gaping windows some of them broken and mended with
old hats and petticoats and over the door was painted the union
hotel by jonathan doolittle instead of the great tree that used to
shelter the quiet little dutch inn of yore there now was reared a tall
naked pole with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap
and from it was fluttering a flag on which was a singular assemblage
of stars and stripes all this was strange and incomprehensible he
recognized on the sign however the ruby face of king george
under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe but even this was
singularly metamorphosed the red coat was changed for one of blue and
buff a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre the head
was decorated with a cocked hat and underneath was painted in large
characters general washington

there was as usual a crowd of folk about the door but none that rip
recollected the very character of the people seemed changed there was
a busy bustling disputatious tone about it instead of the accustomed
phlegm and drowsy tranquillity he looked in vain for the sage nicholas
vedder with his broad face double chin and fair long pipe uttering
clouds of tobacco-smoke instead of idle speeches or van bummel the
schoolmaster doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper in
place of these a lean bilious-looking fellow with his pockets full
of handbills was haranguing vehemently about rights of
citizens-elections members of congress liberty bunker's hill heroes
of seventy-six-and other words which were a perfect babylonish jargon
to the bewildered van winkle

the appearance of rip with his long grizzled beard his rusty
fowling-piece his uncouth dress and the army of women and children at
his heels soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians they
crowded round him eying him from head to foot with great curiosity
the orator bustled up to him and drawing him partly aside inquired
on which side he voted rip stared in vacant stupidity another short
but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm and rising on tiptoe
inquired in his ear whether he was federal or democrat rip
was equally at a loss to comprehend the question when a knowing
self-important old gentleman in a sharp cocked hat made his way
through the crowd putting them to the right and left with his elbows as
he passed and planting himself before van winkle with one arm akimbo
the other resting on his cane his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating
as it were into his very soul demanded in an austere tone what
brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his
heels and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village

alas gentlemen cried rip somewhat dismayed i am a poor quiet
man a native of the place and a loyal subject of the king god bless
him

here a general shout burst from the bystanders-a tory a tory a spy
a refugee hustle him away with him it was with great difficulty
that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order and having
assumed a tenfold austerity of brow demanded again of the unknown
culprit what he came there for and whom he was seeking the poor
man humbly assured him that he meant no harm but merely came there in
search of some of his neighbors who used to keep about the tavern

well who are they name them

rip bethought himself a moment and inquired where's nicholas vedder

there was a silence for a little while when an old man replied in a
thin piping voice nicholas vedder why he is dead and gone these
eighteen years there was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used
to tell all about him but that's rotten and gone too

where's brom dutcher

oh he went off to the army in the beginning of the war some say he
was killed at the storming of stony-point others say he was drowned in
a squall at the foot of antony's nose i don't know he never came back
again

where's van bummel the schoolmaster

he went off to the wars too was a great militia general and is now
in congress

rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home
and friends and finding himself thus alone in the world every answer
puzzled him too by treating of such enormous lapses of time and of
matters which he could not understand war congress-stony-point he
had no courage to ask after any more friends but cried out in despair
does nobody here know rip van winkle

oh rip van winkle exclaimed two or three oh to be sure that's
rip van winkle yonder leaning against the tree

rip looked and beheld a precise counterpart of himself as he went up
the mountain apparently as lazy and certainly as ragged the poor
fellow was now completely confounded he doubted his own identity and
whether he was himself or another man in the midst of his bewilderment
the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was and what was his name

god knows exclaimed he at his wit's end i'm not myself i'm
somebody else that's me yonder-no that's somebody else got into my
shoes i was myself last night but i fell asleep on the mountain and
they've changed my gun and everything's changed and i'm changed and i
can't tell what's my name or who i am

the by-standers began now to look at each other nod wink
significantly and tap their fingers against their foreheads there was
a whisper also about securing the gun and keeping the old fellow from
doing mischief at the very suggestion of which the self-important man
with the cocked hat retired with some precipitation at this critical
moment a fresh comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep
at the gray-bearded man she had a chubby child in her arms which
frightened at his looks began to cry hush rip cried she hush
you little fool the old man won't hurt you the name of the child
the air of the mother the tone of her voice all awakened a train of
recollections in his mind

what is your name my good woman asked he

judith cardenier

and your father's name

ah poor man rip van winkle was his name but it's twenty years
since he went away from home with his gun and never has been heard of
since his dog came home without him but whether he shot himself
or was carried away by the indians nobody can tell i was then but a
little girl

rip had but one more question to ask but he put it with a faltering
voice

where's your mother

oh she too had died but a short time since she broke a blood-vessel in
a fit of passion at a new-england pedler

there was a drop of comfort at least in this intelligence the honest
man could contain himself no longer he caught his daughter and her
child in his arms i am your father cried he-young rip van winkle
once-old rip van winkle now does nobody know poor rip van winkle

all stood amazed until an old woman tottering out from among the
crowd put her hand to her brow and peering under it in his face for
a moment exclaimed sure enough it is rip van winkle it is himself
welcome home again old neighbor why where have you been these twenty
long years

rip's story was soon told for the whole twenty years had been to him
but as one night the neighbors stared when they heard it some were
seen to wink at each other and put their tongues in their cheeks and
the self-important man in the cocked hat who when the alarm was over
had returned to the field screwed down the corners of his mouth and
shook his head upon which there was a general shaking of the head
throughout the assemblage

it was determined however to take the opinion of old peter vanderdonk
who was seen slowly advancing up the road he was a descendant of the
historian of that name who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the
province peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village and well
versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood
he recollected rip at once and corroborated his story in the most
satisfactory manner he assured the company that it was a fact handed
down from his ancestor the historian that the kaatskill mountains had
always been haunted by strange beings that it was affirmed that the
great hendrick hudson the first discoverer of the river and country
kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years with his crew of the
half-moon being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his
enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city
called by his name that his father had once seen them in their old
dutch dresses playing at ninepins in the hollow of the mountain and
that he himself had heard one summer afternoon the sound of their
balls like distant peals of thunder

to make a long story short the company broke up and returned to the
more important concerns of the election rip's daughter took him home to
live with her she had a snug well-furnished house and a stout cheery
farmer for a husband whom rip recollected for one of the urchins that
used to climb upon his back as to rip's son and heir who was the ditto
of himself seen leaning against the tree he was employed to work on
the farm but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to any thing
else but his business

rip now resumed his old walks and habits he soon found many of his
former cronies though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of
time and preferred making friends among the rising generation with
whom he soon grew into great favor

having nothing to do at home and being arrived at that happy age when a
man can be idle with impunity he took his place once more on the bench
at the inn door and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the
village and a chronicle of the old times before the war it was some
time before he could get into the regular track of gossip or could be
made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his
torpor how that there had been a revolutionary war that the country
had thrown off the yoke of old england and that instead of being a
subject to his majesty george the third he was now a free citizen
of the united states rip in fact was no politician the changes of
states and empires made but little impression on him but there was
one species of despotism under which he had long groaned and that
was petticoat government happily that was at an end he had got his
neck out of the yoke of matrimony and could go in and out whenever he
pleased without dreading the tyranny of dame van winkle whenever her
name was mentioned however he shook his head shrugged his shoulders
and cast up his eyes which might pass either for an expression of
resignation to his fate or joy at his deliverance

he used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at mr
doolittle's hotel he was observed at first to vary on some points
every time he told it which was doubtless owing to his having so
recently awaked it at last settled down precisely to the tale i have
related and not a man woman or child in the neighborhood but knew it
by heart some always pretended to doubt the reality of it and insisted
that rip had been out of his head and that this was one point on which
he always remained flighty the old dutch inhabitants however almost
universally gave it full credit even to this day they never hear a
thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the kaatskill but they say
hendrick hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins and it is
a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood when life
hangs heavy on their hands that they might have a quieting draught out
of rip van winkle's flagon

note

the foregoing tale one would suspect had been suggested to mr
knickerbocker by a little german superstition about the emperor
frederick der rothbart and the kypphauser mountain the subjoined note
however which had appended to the tale shows that it is an absolute
fact narrated with his usual fidelity

the story of rip van winkle may seem incredible to many but
nevertheless i give it my full belief for i know the vicinity of our
old dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and
appearances indeed i have heard many stranger stories than this in
the villages along the hudson all of which were too well authenticated
to admit of a doubt i have even talked with rip van winkle myself
who when last i saw him was a very venerable old man and so
perfectly rational and consistent on every other point that i think no
conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain nay i
have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice
and signed with cross in the justice's own handwriting the story
therefore is beyond the possibility of doubt

postscript

the following are travelling notes from a memorandum-book of mr
knickerbocker

the kaatsberg or catskill mountains have always been a region full of
fable the indians considered them the abode of spirits who influenced
the weather spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape and
sending good or bad hunting seasons they were ruled by an old squaw
spirit said to be their mother she dwelt on the highest peak of the
catskills and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut
them at the proper hour she hung up the new moons in the skies and
cut up the old ones into stars in times of drought if properly
propitiated she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and
morning dew and send them off from the crest of the mountain flake
after flake like flakes of carded cotton to float in the air until
dissolved by the heat of the sun they would fall in gentle showers
causing the grass to spring the fruits to ripen and the corn to grow
an inch an hour if displeased however she would brew up clouds black
as ink sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the
midst of its web and when these clouds broke woe betide the valleys

in old times say the indian traditions there was a kind of manitou or
spirit who kept about the wildest recesses of the catskill mountains
and took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kind of evils and
vexations upon the red men sometimes he would assume the form of a
bear a panther or a deer lead the bewildered hunter a weary chase
through tangled forests and among ragged rocks and then spring off with
a loud ho ho leaving him aghast on the brink of a beetling precipice
or raging torrent

the favorite abode of this manitou is still shown it is a rock or cliff
on the loneliest port of the mountains and from the flowering vines
which clamber about it and the wild flowers which abound in its
neighborhood is known by the name of the garden rock near the foot of
it is a small lake the haunt of the solitary bittern with water-snakes
basking in the sun on the leaves of the pond-lilies which lie on the
surface this place was held in great awe by the indians insomuch that
the boldest hunter would not pursue his game within its precincts once
upon a time however a hunter who had lost his way penetrated to the
garden rock where he beheld a number of gourds placed in the crotches
of trees one of these he seized and made off with it but in the hurry
of his retreat he let it fall among the rocks when a great stream
gushed forth which washed him away and swept him down precipices where
he was dished to pieces and the stream made its way to the hudson and
continues to flow to the present day being the identical stream known
by the name of the kaaterskill




english writers on america

methinks i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousting herself
like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks
methinks i see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling
her endazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam milton on the liberty of
the press

it is with feelings of deep regret that i observe the literary animosity
daily growing up between england and america great curiosity has been
awakened of late with respect to the united states and the london press
has teemed with volumes of travels through the republic but they seem
intended to diffuse error rather than knowledge and so successful have
they been that notwithstanding the constant intercourse between
the nations there is no people concerning whom the great mass of the
british public have less pure information or entertain more numerous
prejudices

english travellers are the best and the worst in the world where no
motives of pride or interest intervene none can equal them for
profound and philosophical views of society or faithful and graphical
description of external objects but when either the interest or
reputation of their own country comes in collision with that of another
they go to the opposite extreme and forget their usual probity and
candor in the indulgence of splenetic remark and an illiberal spirit
of ridicule

hence their travels are more honest and accurate the more remote the
country described i would place implicit confidence in an englishman's
description of the regions beyond the cataracts of the nile of unknown
islands in the yellow sea of the interior of india or of any other
tract which other travellers might be apt to picture out with the
illusions of their fancies but i would cautiously receive his account
of his immediate neighbors and of those nations with which he is in
habits of most frequent intercourse however i might be disposed to
trust his probity i dare not trust his prejudices

it has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the
worst kind of english travellers while men of philosophical spirit and
cultivated minds have been sent from england to ransack the poles to
penetrate the deserts and to study the manners and customs of barbarous
nations with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or
pleasure it has been left to the broken-down tradesman the scheming
adventurer the wandering mechanic the manchester and birmingham agent
to be her oracles respecting america from such sources she is content
to receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of
moral and physical development a country in which one of the greatest
political experiments in the history of the world is now performing and
which presents the most profound and momentous studies to the statesman
and the philosopher

that such men should give prejudicial accounts of america is not a
matter of surprise the themes it offers for contemplation are too vast
and elevated for their capacities the national character is yet in a
state of fermentation it may have its frothiness and sediment but
its ingredients are sound and wholesome it has already given proofs of
powerful and generous qualities and the whole promises to settle
down into something substantially excellent but the causes which are
operating to strengthen and ennoble it and its daily indications of
admirable properties are all lost upon these purblind observers who
are only affected by the little asperities incident to its present
situation they are capable of judging only of the surface of things
of those matters which come in contact with their private interests and
personal gratifications they miss some of the snug conveniences
and petty comforts which belong to an old highly-finished and
over-populous state of society where the ranks of useful labor are
crowded and many earn a painful and servile subsistence by studying
the very caprices of appetite and self-indulgence these minor comforts
however are all-important in the estimation of narrow minds which
either do not perceive or will not acknowledge that they are more than
counterbalanced among us by great and generally diffused blessings

they may perhaps have been disappointed in some unreasonable
expectation of sudden gain they may have pictured america to themselves
an el dorado where gold and silver abounded and the natives were
lacking in sagacity and where they were to become strangely and
suddenly rich in some unforeseen but easy manner the same weakness
of mind that indulges absurd expectations produces petulance in
disappointment such persons become embittered against the country on
finding that there as everywhere else a man must sow before he can
reap must win wealth by industry and talent and must contend with the
common difficulties of nature and the shrewdness of an intelligent and
enterprising people

perhaps through mistaken or ill-directed hospitality or from the
prompt disposition to cheer and countenance the stranger prevalent
among my countrymen they may have been treated with unwonted respect
in america and having been accustomed all their lives to consider
themselves below the surface of good society and brought up in a
servile feeling of inferiority they become arrogant on the common
boon of civility they attribute to the lowliness of others their
own elevation and underrate a society where there are no artificial
distinctions and where by any chance such individuals as themselves
can rise to consequence

one would suppose however that information coming from such sources
on a subject where the truth is so desirable would be received with
caution by the censors of the press that the motives of these men
their veracity their opportunities of inquiry and observation and
their capacities for judging correctly would be rigorously scrutinized
before their evidence was admitted in such sweeping extent against a
kindred nation the very reverse however is the case and it furnishes
a striking instance of human inconsistency nothing can surpass the
vigilance with which english critics will examine the credibility of
the traveller who publishes an account of some distant and comparatively
unimportant country how warily will they compare the measurements of a
pyramid or the description of a ruin and how sternly will they censure
any inaccuracy in these contributions of merely curious knowledge while
they will receive with eagerness and unhesitating faith the gross
misrepresentations of coarse and obscure writers concerning a country
with which their own is placed in the most important and delicate
relations nay they will even make these apocryphal volumes text-books
on which to enlarge with a zeal and an ability worthy of a more
generous cause

i shall not however dwell on this irksome and hackneyed topic nor
should i have adverted to it but for the undue interest apparently
taken in it by my countrymen and certain injurious effects which i
apprehend it might produce upon the national feeling we attach too much
consequence to these attacks they cannot do us any essential injury
the tissue of misrepresentations attempted to be woven round us are
like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant our country
continually outgrows them one falsehood after another falls off of
itself we have but to live on and every day we live a whole volume of
refutation

all the writers of england united if we could for a moment suppose
their great minds stooping to so unworthy a combination could not
conceal our rapidly growing importance and matchless prosperity they
could not conceal that these are owing not merely to physical and
local but also to moral causes to the political liberty the general
diffusion of knowledge the prevalence of sound moral and religious
principles which give force and sustained energy to the character of
a people and which in fact have been the acknowledged and wonderful
supporters of their own national power and glory

but why are we so exquisitely alive to the aspersions of england why
do we suffer ourselves to be so affected by the contumely she has
endeavored to cast upon us it is not in the opinion of england alone
that honor lives and reputation has its being the world at large is
the arbiter of a nation's fame with its thousand eyes it witnesses a
nation's deeds and from their collective testimony is national glory or
national disgrace established

for ourselves therefore it is comparatively of but little importance
whether england does us justice or not it is perhaps of far more
importance to herself she is instilling anger and resentment into the
bosom of a youthful nation to grow with its growth and strengthen
with its strength if in america as some of her writers are laboring
to convince her she is hereafter to find an invidious rival and a
gigantic foe she may thank those very writers for having provoked
rivalship and irritated hostility every one knows the all-pervading
influence of literature at the present day and how much the opinions
and passions of mankind are under its control the mere contests of the
sword are temporary their wounds are but in the flesh and it is the
pride of the generous to forgive and forget them but the slanders of
the pen pierce to the heart they rankle longest in the noblest spirits
they dwell ever present in the mind and render it morbidly sensitive
to the most trifling collision it is but seldom that any one overt act
produces hostilities between two nations there exists most commonly a
previous jealousy and ill-will a predisposition to take offence trace
these to their cause and how often will they be found to originate in
the mischievous effusions of mercenary writers who secure in their
closets and for ignominious bread concoct and circulate the venom that
is to inflame the generous and the brave

i am not laying too much stress upon this point for it applies most
emphatically to our particular case over no nation does the press
hold a more absolute control than over the people of america for the
universal education of the poorest classes makes every individual a
reader there is nothing published in england on the subject of our
country that does not circulate through every part of it there is not
a calumny dropt from an english pen nor an unworthy sarcasm uttered by
an english statesman that does not go to blight good-will and add to
the mass of latent resentment possessing then as england does
the fountain-head whence the literature of the language flows how
completely is it in her power and how truly is it her duty to make it
the medium of amiable and magnanimous feeling a stream where the two
nations might meet together and drink in peace and kindness should she
however persist in turning it to waters of bitterness the time may
come when she may repent her folly the present friendship of america
may be of but little moment to her but the future destinies of that
country do not admit of a doubt over those of england there lower
some shadows of uncertainty should then a day of gloom arrive should
those reverses overtake her from which the proudest empires have
not been exempt she may look back with regret at her infatuation in
repulsing from her side a nation she might have grappled to her bosom
and thus destroying her only chance for real friendship beyond the
boundaries of her own dominions

there is a general impression in england that the people of the united
states are inimical to the parent country it is one of the errors
which have been diligently propagated by designing writers there is
doubtless considerable political hostility and a general soreness at
the illiberality of the english press but collectively speaking the
prepossessions of the people are strongly in favor of england indeed
at one time they amounted in many parts of the union to an absurd
degree of bigotry the bare name of englishman was a passport to
the confidence and hospitality of every family and too often gave a
transient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful throughout the
country there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea
of england we looked to it with a hallowed feeling of tenderness and
veneration as the land of our forefathers the august repository of the
monuments and antiquities of our race the birthplace and mausoleum of
the sages and heroes of our paternal history after our own country
there was none in whose glory we more delighted none whose good opinion
we were more anxious to possess none toward which our hearts yearned
with such throbbings of warm consanguinity even during the late war
whenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring
forth it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show
that in the midst of hostilities they still kept alive the sparks of
future friendship

is all this to be at an end is this golden band of kindred sympathies
so rare between nations to be broken forever perhaps it is for the
best it may dispel an allusion which might have kept us in mental
vassalage which might have interfered occasionally with our true
interests and prevented the growth of proper national pride but it
is hard to give up the kindred tie and there are feelings dearer than
interest closer to the heart than pride that will still make us cast
back a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from the paternal
roof and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the
affections of the child

short-sighted and injudicious however as the conduct or england may be
in this system of aspersion recrimination on our part would be equally
ill-judged i speak not of a prompt and spirited vindication of our
country or the keenest castigation of her slanderers but i allude to
a disposition to retaliate in kind to retort sarcasm and inspire
prejudice which seems to be spreading widely among our writers let us
guard particularly against such a temper for it would double the evil
instead of redressing the wrong nothing is so easy and inviting as
the retort of abuse and sarcasm but it is a paltry and an unprofitable
contest it is the alternative of a morbid mind fretted into petulance
rather than warmed into indignation if england is willing to permit the
mean jealousies of trade or the rancorous animosities of politics to
deprave the integrity of her press and poison the fountain of public
opinion let us beware of her example she may deem it her interest
to diffuse error and engender antipathy for the purpose of checking
emigration we have no purpose of the kind to serve neither have we
any spirit of national jealousy to gratify for as yet in all our
rivalships with england we are the rising and the gaining party
there can be no end to answer therefore but the gratification of
resentment a mere spirit of retaliation and even that is impotent our
retorts are never republished in england they fall short therefore
of their aim but they foster a querulous and peevish temper among
our writers they sour the sweet flow of our early literature and
sow thorns and brambles among its blossoms what is still worse they
circulate through our own country and as far as they have effect
excite virulent national prejudices this last is the evil most
especially to be deprecated governed as we are entirely by public
opinion the utmost care should be taken to preserve the purity of
the public mind knowledge is power and truth is knowledge whoever
therefore knowingly propagates a prejudice wilfully saps the
foundation of his country's strength

the members of a republic above all other men should be candid and
dispassionate they are individually portions of the sovereign mind
and sovereign will and should be enabled to come to all questions of
national concern with calm and unbiassed judgments from the peculiar
nature of our relations with england we must have more frequent
questions of a difficult and delicate character with her than with
any other nation questions that affect the most acute and excitable
feelings and as in the adjustment of these our national measures
must ultimately be determined by popular sentiment we cannot be
too anxiously attentive to purify it from all latent passion or
prepossession

opening too as we do an asylum for strangers every portion of the
earth we should receive all with impartiality it should be our pride
to exhibit an example of one nation at least destitute of national
antipathies and exercising not merely the overt acts of hospitality
but those more rare and noble courtesies which spring from liberality of
opinion

what have we to do with national prejudices they are the inveterate
diseases of old countries contracted in rude and ignorant ages when
nations knew but little of each other and looked beyond their own
boundaries with distrust and hostility we on the contrary have sprung
into national existence in an enlightened and philosophic age when the
different parts of the habitable world and the various branches of the
human family have been indefatigably studied and made known to each
other and we forego the advantages of our birth if we do not shake off
the national prejudices as we would the local superstitions of the old
world

but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far
as to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and
amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an
imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree
from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of
our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous
to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activity their
freedom of opinion their habits of thinking on those subjects which
concern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private
life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all
intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people
that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however
the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be
something solid in the basis admirable in the materials and stable in
the structure of an edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the
tempests of the world

let it be the pride of our writers therefore discarding all feelings
of irritation and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of british
authors to speak of the english nation without prejudice and with
determined candor while they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with
which some of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing english
merely because it is english let them frankly point out what is
really worthy of approbation we may thus place england before us as
a perpetual volume of reference wherein are recorded sound deductions
from ages of experience and while we avoid the errors and absurdities
which may have crept into the page we may draw thence golden maxims of
practical wisdom wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national
character




rural life in england

 oh friendly to the best pursuits of man
 friendly to thought to virtue and to peace
 domestic life in rural pleasures past
 cowper

the stranger who would form a correct opinion of the english character
must not confine his observations to the metropolis he must go forth
into the country he must sojourn in villages and hamlets he must visit
castles villas farm-houses cottages he must wander through parks
and gardens along hedges and green lanes he must loiter about country
churches attend wakes and fairs and other rural festivals and cope
with the people in all their conditions and all their habits and
humors

in some countries the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of
the nation they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent
society and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish
peasantry in england on the contrary the metropolis is a mere
gathering-place or general rendezvous of the polite classes where
they devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gayety and
dissipation and having indulged this kind of carnival return again to
the apparently more congenial habits of rural life the various orders
of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom
and the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different
ranks

the english in fact are strongly gifted with the rural feeling they
possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature and a keen relish
for the pleasures and employments of the country this passion seems
inherent in them even the inhabitants of cities born and brought up
among brick walls and bustling streets enter with facility into rural
habits and evince a tact for rural occupation the merchant has his
snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis where he often displays
as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower-garden and the
maturing of his fruits as he does in the conduct of his business
and the success of a commercial enterprise even those less fortunate
individuals who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and
traffic contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green
aspect of nature in the most dark and dingy quarters of the city the
drawing-room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers every spot
capable of vegetation has its grass-plot and flower-bed and every
square its mimic park laid out with picturesque taste and gleaming
with refreshing verdure

those who see the englishman only in town are apt to form an
unfavorable opinion of his social character he is either absorbed in
business or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time
thought and feeling in this huge metropolis he has therefore too
commonly a look of hurry and abstraction wherever he happens to be he
is on the point of going somewhere else at the moment he is talking
on one subject his mind is wandering to another and while paying a
friendly visit he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to
pay the other visits allotted to the morning an immense metropolis
like london is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting
in their casual and transient meetings they can but deal briefly in
commonplaces they present but the cold superfices of character its
rich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow

it is in the country that the englishman gives scope to his natural
feelings he breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative
civilities of town throws off his habits of shy reserve and becomes
joyous and free-hearted he manages to collect round him all the
conveniences and elegancies of polite life and to banish its
restraints his country-seat abounds with every requisite either for
studious retirement tasteful gratification or rural exercise books
paintings music horses dogs and sporting implements of all kinds
are at hand he puts no constraint either upon his guests or himself
but in the true spirit of hospitality provides the means of enjoyment
and leaves every one to partake according to his inclination

the taste of the english in the cultivation of land and in what is
called landscape gardening is unrivalled they have studied nature
intently and discovered an exquisite sense of her beautiful forms and
harmonious combinations those charms which in other countries she
lavishes in wild solitudes are here assembled round the haunts of
domestic life they seem to have caught her coy and furtive graces and
spread them like witchery about their rural abodes

nothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of english park
scenery vast lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green with here
and there clumps of gigantic trees heaping up rich piles of foliage
the solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades with the deer trooping in
silent herds across them the hare bounding away to the covert or the
pheasant suddenly bursting upon the wing the brook taught to wind in
natural meanderings or expand into a glassy lake the sequestered pool
reflecting the quivering trees with the yellow leaf sleeping on its
bosom and the trout roaming fearlessly about its limpid waters while
some rustic temple or sylvan statue grown green and dank with age
gives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion

these are but a few of the features of park scenery but what most
delights me is the creative talent with which the english decorate the
unostentatious abodes of middle life the rudest habitation the most
unpromising and scanty portion of land in the hands of an englishman of
taste becomes a little paradise with a nicely discriminating eye
he seizes at once upon its capabilities and pictures in his mind the
future landscape the sterile spot grows into loveliness under his hand
and yet the operations of art which produce the effect are scarcely to
be perceived the cherishing and training of some trees the cautious
pruning of others the nice distribution of flowers and plants of tender
and graceful foliage the introduction of a green slope of velvet turf
the partial opening to a peep of blue distance or silver gleam of
water-all these are managed with a delicate tact a pervading yet quiet
assiduity like the magic touchings with which a painter finishes up a
favorite picture

the residence of people of fortune and refinement in the country has
diffused a degree of taste and elegance in rural economy that descends
to the lowest class the very laborer with his thatched cottage and
narrow slip of ground attends to their embellishment the trim hedge
the grass-plot before the door the little flower-bed bordered with snug
box the woodbine trained up against the wall and hanging its blossoms
about the lattice the pot of flowers in the window the holly
providently planted about the house to cheat winter of its dreariness
and to throw in a semblance of green summer to cheer the fireside all
these bespeak the influence of taste flowing down from high sources
and pervading the lowest levels of the public mind if ever love as
poets sing delights to visit a cottage it must be the cottage of an
english peasant

the fondness for rural life among the higher classes of the english has
had a great and salutary effect upon the national character i do not
know a finer race of men than the english gentlemen instead of the
softness and effeminacy which characterize the men of rank in most
countries they exhibit a union of elegance and strength a robustness
of frame and freshness of complexion which i am inclined to attribute
to their living so much in the open air and pursuing so eagerly the
invigorating recreations of the country the hardy exercises produce
also a healthful tone of mind and spirits and a manliness and
simplicity of manners which even the follies and dissipations of the
town cannot easily pervert and can never entirely destroy in the
country too the different orders of society seem to approach more
freely to be more disposed to blend and operate favorably upon each
other the distinctions between them do not appear to be so marked
and impassable as in the cities the manner in which property has been
distributed into small estates and farms has established a regular
gradation from the noblemen through the classes of gentry small landed
proprietors and substantial farmers down to the laboring peasantry
and while it has thus banded the extremes of society together has
infused into each intermediate rank a spirit of independence this it
must be confessed is not so universally the case at present as it was
formerly the larger estates having in late years of distress absorbed
the smaller and in some parts of the country almost annihilated the
sturdy race of small farmers these however i believe are but casual
breaks in the general system i have mentioned

in rural occupation there is nothing mean and debasing it leads a man
forth among scenes of natural grandeur and beauty it leaves him to the
workings of his own mind operated upon by the purest and most elevating
of external influences such a man may be simple and rough but he
cannot be vulgar the man of refinement therefore finds nothing
revolting in an intercourse with the lower orders in rural life as he
does when he casually mingles with the lower orders of cities he lays
aside his distance and reserve and is glad to waive the distinctions of
rank and to enter into the honest heartfelt enjoyments of common life
indeed the very amusements of the country bring men more and more
together and the sound hound and horn blend all feelings into harmony
i believe this is one great reason why the nobility and gentry are more
popular among the inferior orders in england than they are in any other
country and why the latter have endured so many excessive pressures and
extremities without repining more generally at the unequal distribution
of fortune and privilege

to this mingling of cultivated and rustic society may also be attributed
the rural feeling that runs through british literature the frequent
use of illustrations from rural life those incomparable descriptions of
nature that abound in the british poets that have continued down from
the flower and the leaf of chaucer and have brought into our closets
all the freshness and fragrance of the dewy landscape the pastoral
writers of other countries appear as if they had paid nature an
occasional visit and become acquainted with her general charms but the
british poets have lived and revelled with her they have wooed her in
her most secret haunts they have watched her minutest caprices a
spray could not tremble in the breeze a leaf could not rustle to the
ground a diamond drop could not patter in the stream a fragrance could
not exhale from the humble violet nor a daisy unfold its crimson
tints to the morning but it has been noticed by these impassioned and
delicate observers and wrought up into some beautiful morality

the effect of this devotion of elegant minds to rural occupations has
been wonderful on the face of the country a great part of the island
is rather level and would be monotonous were it not for the charms
of culture but it is studded and gemmed as it were with castles and
palaces and embroidered with parks and gardens it does not abound in
grand and sublime prospects but rather in little home scenes of rural
repose and sheltered quiet every antique farm-house and moss-grown
cottage is a picture and as the roads are continually winding and
the view is shut in by groves and hedges the eye is delighted by a
continual succession of small landscapes of captivating loveliness

the great charm however of english scenery is the moral feeling that
seems to pervade it it is associated in the mind with ideas of order
of quiet of sober well-established principles of hoary usage and
reverend custom every thing seems to be the growth of ages of regular
and peaceful existence the old church of remote architecture with its
low massive portal its gothic tower its windows rich with tracery
and painted glass in scrupulous preservation its stately monuments of
warriors and worthies of the olden time ancestors of the present lords
of the soil its tombstones recording successive generations of sturdy
yeomanry whose progeny still plough the same fields and kneel at the
same altar the parsonage a quaint irregular pile partly
antiquated but repaired and altered in the tastes of various ages and
occupants the stile and foot-path leading from the churchyard across
pleasant fields and along shady hedgerows according to an immemorial
right of way the neighboring village with its venerable cottages
its public green sheltered by trees under which the forefathers of the
present race have sported the antique family mansion standing apart
in some little rural domain but looking down with a protecting air on
the surrounding scene all these common features of english landscape
evince a calm and settled security a hereditary transmission of
homebred virtues and local attachments that speak deeply and touchingly
for the moral character of the nation

it is a pleasing sight of a sunday morning when the bell is sending
its sober melody across the quiet fields to behold the peasantry in
their best finery with ruddy faces and modest cheerfulness thronging
tranquilly along the green lanes to church but it is still more
pleasing to see them in the evenings gathering about their cottage
doors and appearing to exult in the humble comforts and embellishments
which their own hands have spread around them

it is this sweet home-feeling this settled repose of affection in the
domestic scene that is after all the parent of the steadiest virtues
and purest enjoyments and i cannot close these desultory remarks
better than by quoting the words of a modern english poet who has
depicted it with remarkable felicity

 through each gradation from the castled hall
 the city dome the villa crowned with shade
 but chief from modest mansions numberless
 in town or hamlet shelt'ring middle life
 down to the cottaged vale and straw-roof'd shed
 this western isle has long been famed for scenes
 where bliss domestic finds a dwelling-place
 domestic bliss that like a harmless dove
 honor and sweet endearment keeping guard
 can centre in a little quiet nest
 all that desire would fly for through the earth
 that can the world eluding be itself
 a world enjoyed that wants no witnesses
 but its own sharers and approving heaven
 that like a flower deep hid in rock cleft
 smiles though t is looking only at the sky


 from a poem on the death of the princess charlotte by the
 reverend rann kennedy am





the broken heart

 i never heard
 of any true affection but t was nipt
 with care that like the caterpillar eats
 the leaves of the spring's sweetest book the rose
 middleton

it is a common practice with those who have outlived the susceptibility
of early feeling or have been brought up in the gay heartlessness of
dissipated life to laugh at all love stories and to treat the tales
of romantic passion as mere fictions of novelists and poets my
observations on human nature have induced me to think otherwise they
have convinced me that however the surface of the character may be
chilled and frozen by the cares of the world or cultivated into mere
smiles by the arts of society still there are dormant fires lurking
in the depths of the coldest bosom which when once enkindled become
impetuous and are sometimes desolating in their effects indeed i am
a true believer in the blind deity and go to the full extent of his
doctrines shall i confess it i believe in broken hearts and the
possibility of dying of disappointed love i do not however consider
it a malady often fatal to my own sex but i firmly believe that it
withers down many a lovely woman into an early grave

man is the creature of interest and ambition his nature leads him forth
into the struggle and bustle of the world love is but the embellishment
of his early life or a song piped in the intervals of the acts he
seeks for fame for fortune for space in the world's thought and
dominion over his fellow-men but a woman's whole life is a history of
the affections the heart is her world it is there her ambition strives
for empire it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures she
sends forth her sympathies on adventure she embarks her whole soul in
the traffic of affection and if shipwrecked her case is hopeless for
it is a bankruptcy of the heart

to a man the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs
it wounds some feelings of tenderness it blasts some prospects of
felicity but he is an active being he may dissipate his thoughts in
the whirl of varied occupation or may plunge into the tide of pleasure
or if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations
he can shift his abode at will and taking as it were the wings of the
morning can fly to the uttermost parts of the earth and be at rest

but woman's is comparatively a fixed a secluded and meditative life
she is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings and if they
are turned to ministers of sorrow where shall she look for consolation
her lot is to be wooed and won and if unhappy in her love her heart
is like some fortress that has been captured and sacked and abandoned
and left desolate

how many bright eyes grow dim how many soft cheeks grow pale how many
lovely forms fade away into the tomb and none can tell the cause that
blighted their loveliness as the dove will clasp its wings to its side
and cover and conceal the arrow that is preying on its vitals so is
it the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs of wounded
affection the love of a delicate female is always shy and silent even
when fortunate she scarcely breathes it to herself but when otherwise
she buries it in the recesses of her bosom and there lets it cower and
brood among the ruins of her peace with her the desire of her heart
has failed the great charm of existence is at an end she neglects all
the cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits quicken the pulses
and send the tide of life in healthful currents through the veins her
rest is broken the sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy
dreams dry sorrow drinks her blood until her enfeebled frame sinks
under the slightest external injury look for her after a little while
and you find friendship weeping over her untimely grave and wondering
that one who but lately glowed with all the radiance of health and
beauty should so speedily be brought down to darkness and the worm
you will be told of some wintry chill some casual indisposition that
laid her low but no one knows of the mental malady which previously
sapped her strength and made her so easy a prey to the spoiler

she is like some tender tree the pride and beauty of the grove
graceful in its form bright in its foliage but with the worm preying
at its heart we find it suddenly withering when it should be most
fresh and luxuriant we see it drooping its branches to the earth and
shedding leaf by leaf until wasted and perished away it falls even in
the stillness of the forest and as we muse over the beautiful ruin
we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have
smitten it with decay

i have seen many instances of women running to waste and self-neglect
and disappearing gradually from the earth almost as if they had been
exhaled to heaven and have repeatedly fancied that i could trace their
deaths through the various declensions of consumption cold debility
languor melancholy until i reached the first symptom of disappointed
love but an instance of the kind was lately told to me the
circumstances are well known in the country where they happened and i
shall but give them in the manner in which they were related

every one must recollect the tragical story of young e the irish
patriot it was too touching to be soon forgotten during the troubles
in ireland he was tried condemned and executed on a charge of
treason his fate made a deep impression on public sympathy he was so
young so intelligent so generous so brave so every thing that we are
apt to like in a young man his conduct under trial too was so lofty
and intrepid the noble indignation with which he repelled the charge of
treason against his country the eloquent vindication of his
name and his pathetic appeal to posterity in the hopeless hour of
condemnation all these entered deeply into every generous bosom and
even his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution

but there was one heart whose anguish it would be impossible to
describe in happier days and fairer fortunes he had won the affections
of a beautiful and interesting girl the daughter of a late celebrated
irish barrister she loved him with the disinterested fervor of a
woman's first and early love when every worldly maxim arrayed itself
against him when blasted in fortune and disgrace and danger
darkened around his name she loved him the more ardently for his very
sufferings if then his fate could awaken the sympathy even of
his foes what must have been the agony of her whose whole soul was
occupied by his image let those tell who have had the portals of the
tomb suddenly closed between them and the being they most loved on
earth who have sat at its threshold as one shut out in a cold and
lonely world whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed

but then the horrors of such a grave so frightful so dishonored
there was nothing for memory to dwell on that could soothe the pang of
separation none of those tender though melancholy circumstances which
endear the parting scene nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed
tears sent like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parting
hour of anguish

to render her widowed situation more desolate she had incurred her
father's displeasure by her unfortunate attachment and was an exile
from the parental roof but could the sympathy and kind offices of
friends have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror she
would have experienced no want of consolation for the irish are a
people of quick and generous sensibilities the most delicate
and cherishing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and
distinction she was led into society and they tried by all kinds of
occupation and amusement to dissipate her grief and wean her from the
tragical story of her loves but it was all in vain there are some
strokes of calamity that scathe and scorch the soul which penetrate to
the vital seat of happiness and blast it never again to put forth bud
or blossom she never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure but
was as much alone there as in the depths of solitude walking about in a
sad revery apparently unconscious of the world around her she
carried with her an inward woe that mocked at all the blandishments of
friendship and heeded not the song of the charmer charm he never so
wisely

the person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade there can
be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and painful than
to meet it in such a scene to find it wandering like a spectre lonely
and joyless where all around is gay to see it dressed out in the
trappings of mirth and looking so wan and woe-begone as if it had
tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into momentary forgetfulness of
sorrow after strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with
an air of utter abstraction she sat herself down on the steps of an
orchestra and looking about for some time with a vacant air that
showed her insensibility to the garish scene she began with the
capriciousness of a sickly heart to warble a little plaintive air
she had an exquisite voice but on this occasion it was so simple so
touching it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness that she drew a
crowd mute and silent around her and melted every one into tears

the story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest
in a country remarkable for enthusiasm it completely won the heart of
a brave officer who paid his addresses to her and thought that one so
true to the dead could not but prove affectionate to the living she
declined his attentions for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed by
the memory of her former lover he however persisted in his suit he
solicited not her tenderness but her esteem he was assisted by
her conviction of his worth and her sense of her own destitute and
dependent situation for she was existing on the kindness of friends
in a word he at length succeeded in gaining her hand though with the
solemn assurance that her heart was unalterably another's

he took her with him to sicily hoping that a change of scene might
wear out the remembrance of early woes she was an amiable and exemplary
wife and made an effort to be a happy one but nothing could cure the
silent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very soul she
wasted away in a slow but hopeless decline and at length sunk into the
grave the victim of a broken heart

it was on her that moore the distinguished irish poet composed the
following lines

 she is far from the land where her young hero sleeps
 and lovers around her are sighing
 but coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps
 for her heart in his grave is lying

 she sings the wild song of her dear native plains
 every note which he loved awaking 
 ah little they think who delight in her strains
 how the heart of the minstrel is breaking

 he had lived for his love for his country he died
 they were all that to life had entwined him 
 nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried
 nor long will his love stay behind him

 oh make her a grave where the sunbeams rest
 when they promise a glorious morrow
 they'll shine o'er her sleep like a smile from the west
 from her own loved island of sorrow




the art of book-making

if that severe doom of synesius be true it is a greater offence to
steal dead men's labor than their clothes what shall become of most
writers burton's anatomy of melancholy

i have often wondered at the extreme fecundity of the press and how
it comes to pass that so many heads on which nature seems to have
inflicted the curse of barrenness should teem with voluminous
productions as a man travels on however in the journey of life his
objects of wonder daily diminish and he is continually finding out some
very simple cause for some great matter of marvel thus have i chanced
in my peregrinations about this great metropolis to blunder upon a
scene which unfolded to me some of the mysteries of the book-making
craft and at once put an end to my astonishment

i was one summer's day loitering through the great saloons of the
british museum with that listlessness with which one is apt to saunter
about a museum in warm weather sometimes lolling over the glass cases
of minerals sometimes studying the hieroglyphics on an egyptian mummy
and some times trying with nearly equal success to comprehend the
allegorical paintings on the lofty ceilings whilst i was gazing about
in this idle way my attention was attracted to a distant door at the
end of a suite of apartments it was closed but every now and then it
would open and some strange-favored being generally clothed in black
would steal forth and glide through the rooms without noticing any
of the surrounding objects there was an air of mystery about this that
piqued my languid curiosity and i determined to attempt the passage of
that strait and to explore the unknown regions beyond the door yielded
to my hand with all that facility with which the portals of enchanted
castles yield to the adventurous knight-errant i found myself in a
spacious chamber surrounded with great cases of venerable books above
the cases and just under the cornice were arranged a great number of
black-looking portraits of ancient authors about the room were placed
long tables with stands for reading and writing at which sat many
pale studious personages poring intently over dusty volumes rummaging
among mouldy manuscripts and taking copious notes of their contents
a hushed stillness reigned through this mysterious apartment excepting
that you might hear the racing of pens over sheets of paper and
occasionally the deep sigh of one of these sages as he shifted his
position to turn over the page of an old folio doubtless arising from
that hollowness and flatulency incident to learned research

now and then one of these personages would write something on a small
slip of paper and ring a bell whereupon a familiar would appear take
the paper in profound silence glide out of the room and return shortly
loaded with ponderous tomes upon which the other would fall tooth
and nail with famished voracity i had no longer a doubt that i had
happened upon a body of magi deeply engaged in the study of occult
sciences the scene reminded me of an old arabian tale of a philosopher
shut up in an enchanted library in the bosom of a mountain which
opened only once a year where he made the spirits of the place bring
him books of all kinds of dark knowledge so that at the end of the
year when the magic portal once more swung open on its hinges he
issued forth so versed in forbidden lore as to be able to soar above
the heads of the multitude and to control the powers of nature

my curiosity being now fully aroused i whispered to one of
the familiars as he was about to leave the room and begged an
interpretation of the strange scene before me a few words were
sufficient for the purpose i found that these mysterious personages
whom i had mistaken for magi were principally authors and were in the
very act of manufacturing books i was in fact in the reading-room of
the great british library an immense collection of volumes of all ages
and languages many of which are now forgotten and most of which are
seldom read one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature to
which modern authors repair and draw buckets full of classic lore or
pure english undefiled wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of
thought

being now in possession of the secret i sat down in a corner and
watched the process of this book manufactory i noticed one lean
bilious-looking wight who sought none but the most worm-eaten volumes
printed in black letter he was evidently constructing some work of
profound erudition that would be purchased by every man who wished to
be thought learned placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library or
laid open upon his table but never read i observed him now and then
draw a large fragment of biscuit out of his pocket and gnaw whether
it was his dinner or whether he was endeavoring to keep off that
exhaustion of the stomach produced by much pondering over dry works i
leave to harder students than myself to determine

there was one dapper little gentleman in bright-colored clothes with a
chirping gossiping expression of countenance who had all the appearance
of an author on good terms with his bookseller after considering him
attentively i recognized in him a diligent getter-up of miscellaneous
works which bustled off well with the trade i was curious to see how
he manufactured his wares he made more stir and show of business than
any of the others dipping into various books fluttering over the
leaves of manuscripts taking a morsel out of one a morsel out of
another line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there
a little the contents of his book seemed to be as heterogeneous as
those of the witches cauldron in macbeth it was here a finger and
there a thumb toe of frog and blind worm's sting with his own gossip
poured in like baboon's blood to make the medley slab and good

after all thought i may not this pilfering disposition be implanted in
authors for wise purposes may it not be the way in which providence
has taken care that the seeds of knowledge and wisdom shall be preserved
from age to age in spite of the inevitable decay of the works in
which they were first produced we see that nature has wisely though
whimsically provided for the conveyance of seeds from clime to clime
in the maws of certain birds so that animals which in themselves are
little better than carrion and apparently the lawless plunderers of the
orchard and the corn-field are in fact nature's carriers to disperse
and perpetuate her blessings in like manner the beauties and fine
thoughts of ancient and obsolete authors are caught up by these flights
of predatory writers and cast forth again to flourish and bear fruit
in a remote and distant tract of time many of their works also
undergo a kind of metempsychosis and spring up under new forms what
was formerly a ponderous history revives in the shape of a romance an
old legend changes into a modern play and a sober philosophical
treatise furnishes the body for a whole series of bouncing and sparkling
essays thus it is in the clearing of our american woodlands where we
burn down a forest of stately pines a progeny of dwarf oaks start up in
their place and we never see the prostrate trunk of a tree mouldering
into soil but it gives birth to a whole tribe of fungi

let us not then lament over the decay and oblivion into which ancient
writers descend they do but submit to the great law of nature which
declares that all sublunary shapes of matter shall be limited in their
duration but which decrees also that their element shall never
perish generation after generation both in animal and vegetable life
passes away but the vital principle is transmitted to posterity and
the species continue to flourish thus also do authors beget authors
and having produced a numerous progeny in a good old age they sleep
with their fathers that is to say with the authors who preceded
them and from whom they had stolen

whilst i was indulging in these rambling fancies i had leaned my head
against a pile of reverend folios whether it was owing to the soporific
emanations for these works or to the profound quiet of the room or
to the lassitude arising from much wandering or to an unlucky habit
of napping at improper times and places with which i am grievously
afflicted so it was that i fell into a doze still however my
imagination continued busy and indeed the same scene continued before
my mind's eye only a little changed in some of the details i dreamt
that the chamber was still decorated with the portraits of ancient
authors but that the number was increased the long tables had
disappeared and in place of the sage magi i beheld a ragged
threadbare throng such as may be seen plying about the great repository
of cast-off clothes monmouth street whenever they seized upon a book
by one of those incongruities common to dreams methought it turned into
a garment of foreign or antique fashion with which they proceeded to
equip themselves i noticed however that no one pretended to clothe
himself from any particular suit but took a sleeve from one a cape
from another a skirt from a third thus decking himself out piecemeal
while some of his original rags would peep out from among his borrowed
finery

there was a portly rosy well-fed parson whom i observed ogling
several mouldy polemical writers through an eyeglass he soon contrived
to slip on the voluminous mantle of one of the old fathers and having
purloined the gray beard of another endeavored to look exceedingly
wise but the smirking commonplace of his countenance set at naught
all the trappings of wisdom one sickly-looking gentleman was busied
embroidering a very flimsy garment with gold thread drawn out of several
old court-dresses of the reign of queen elizabeth another had trimmed
himself magnificently from an illuminated manuscript had stuck a
nosegay in his bosom culled from the paradise of dainty devices and
having put sir philip sidney's hat on one side of his head strutted off
with an exquisite air of vulgar elegance a third who was but of puny
dimensions had bolstered himself out bravely with the spoils from
several obscure tracts of philosophy so that he had a very imposing
front but he was lamentably tattered in rear and i perceived that
he had patched his small-clothes with scraps of parchment from a latin
author

there were some well-dressed gentlemen it is true who only helped
themselves to a gem or so which sparkled among their own ornaments
without eclipsing them some too seemed to contemplate the costumes
of the old writers merely to imbibe their principles of taste and to
catch their air and spirit but i grieve to say that too many were apt
to array themselves from top to toe in the patchwork manner i have
mentioned i shall not omit to speak of one genius in drab breeches
and gaiters and an arcadian hat who had a violent propensity to the
pastoral but whose rural wanderings had been confined to the classic
haunts of primrose hill and the solitudes of the regent's park he had
decked himself in wreaths and ribbons from all the old pastoral poets
and hanging his head on one side went about with a fantastical
lackadaisical air babbling about green field but the personage that
most struck my attention was a pragmatical old gentleman in clerical
robes with a remarkably large and square but bald head he entered the
room wheezing and puffing elbowed his way through the throng with a
look of sturdy self-confidence and having laid hands upon a thick
greek quarto clapped it upon his head and swept majestically away in a
formidable frizzled wig

in the height of this literary masquerade a cry suddenly resounded from
every side of thieves thieves i looked and lo the portraits about
the walls became animated the old authors thrust out first a head
then a shoulder from the canvas looked down curiously for an instant
upon the motley throng and then descended with fury in their eyes
to claim their rifled property the scene of scampering and hubbub that
ensued baffles all description the unhappy culprits endeavored in vain
to escape with their plunder on one side might be seen half a dozen
old monks stripping a modern professor on another there was sad
devastation carried into the ranks of modern dramatic writers beaumont
and fletcher side by side raged round the field like castor and
pollux and sturdy ben jonson enacted more wonders than when a volunteer
with the army in flanders as to the dapper little compiler of farragos
mentioned some time since he had arrayed himself in as many patches and
colors as harlequin and there was as fierce a contention of claimants
about him as about the dead body of patroclus i was grieved to
see many men to whom i had been accustomed to look up with awe and
reverence fain to steal off with scarce a rag to cover their nakedness
just then my eye was caught by the pragmatical old gentleman in the
greek grizzled wig who was scrambling away in sore affright with half
a score of authors in full cry after him they were close upon his
haunches in a twinkling off went his wig at every turn some strip of
raiment was peeled away until in a few moments from his domineering
pomp he shrunk into a little pursy chopp'd bald shot and made his
exit with only a few tags and rags fluttering at his back

there was something so ludicrous in the catastrophe of this learned
theban that i burst into an immoderate fit of laughter which broke the
whole illusion the tumult and the scuffle were at an end the chamber
resumed its usual appearance the old authors shrunk back into their
picture-frames and hung in shadowy solemnity along the walls in short
i found myself wide awake in my corner with the whole assemblage of
hookworms gazing at me with astonishment nothing of the dream had been
real but my burst of laughter a sound never before heard in that grave
sanctuary and so abhorrent to the ears of wisdom as to electrify the
fraternity

the librarian now stepped up to me and demanded whether i had a card of
admission at first i did not comprehend him but i soon found that the
library was a kind of literary preserve subject to game-laws and
that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and
permission in a word i stood convicted of being an arrant poacher and
was glad to make a precipitate retreat lest i should have a whole pack
of authors let loose upon me




a royal poet

 though your body be confined
 and soft love a prisoner bound
 yet the beauty of your mind
 neither check nor chain hath found
 look out nobly then and dare
 even the fetters that you wear
 fletcher

on a soft sunny morning in the genial month of may i made an excursion
to windsor castle it is a place full of storied and poetical
associations the very external aspect of the proud old pile is enough
to inspire high thought it rears its irregular walls and massive
towers like a mural crown around the brow of a lofty ridge waves its
royal banner in the clouds and looks down with a lordly air upon the
surrounding world

on this morning the weather was of that voluptuous vernal kind which
calls forth all the latent romance of a man's temperament filling his
mind with music and disposing him to quote poetry and dream of beauty
in wandering through the magnificent saloons and long echoing galleries
of the castle i passed with indifference by whole rows of portraits
of warriors and statesmen but lingered in the chamber where hang the
likenesses of the beauties which graced the gay court of charles
the second and as i gazed upon them depicted with amorous
half-dishevelled tresses and the sleepy eye of love i blessed the
pencil of sir peter lely which had thus enabled me to bask in the
reflected rays of beauty in traversing also the large green courts
with sunshine beaming on the gray walls and glancing along the velvet
turf my mind was engrossed with the image of the tender the gallant
but hapless surrey and his account of his loiterings about them in his
stripling days when enamoured of the lady geraldine 

 with eyes cast up unto the maiden's tower
 with easie sighs such as men draw in love

in this mood of mere poetical susceptibility i visited the ancient keep
of the castle where james the first of scotland the pride and theme of
scottish poets and historians was for many years of his youth detained
a prisoner of state it is a large gray tower that has stood the brunt
of ages and is still in good preservation it stands on a mound which
elevates it above the other parts of the castle and a great flight of
steps leads to the interior in the armory a gothic hall furnished with
weapons of various kinds and ages i was shown a coat of armor hanging
against the wall which had once belonged to james hence i
was conducted up a staircase to a suite of apartments of faded
magnificence hung with storied tapestry which formed his prison and
the scene of that passionate and fanciful amour which has woven into
the web of his story the magical hues of poetry and fiction

the whole history of this amiable but unfortunate prince is highly
romantic at the tender age of eleven he was sent from home by his
father robert iii and destined for the french court to be reared
under the eye of the french monarch secure from the treachery and
danger that surrounded the royal house of scotland it was his mishap
in the course of his voyage to fall into the hands of the english
and he was detained prisoner by henry iv notwithstanding that a truce
existed between the two countries

the intelligence of his capture coming in the train of many sorrows and
disasters proved fatal to his unhappy father the news we are told
was brought to him while at supper and did so overwhelm him with grief
that he was almost ready to give up the ghost into the hands of the
servants that attended him but being carried to his bedchamber he
abstained from all food and in three days died of hunger and grief at
rothesay


 buchanan


james was detained in captivity above eighteen years but though
deprived of personal liberty he was treated with the respect due to
his rank care was taken to instruct him in all the branches of useful
knowledge cultivated at that period and to give him those mental and
personal accomplishments deemed proper for a prince perhaps in this
respect his imprisonment was an advantage as it enabled him to apply
himself the more exclusively to his improvement and quietly to imbibe
that rich fund of knowledge and to cherish those elegant tastes which
have given such a lustre to his memory the picture drawn of him in
early life by the scottish historians is highly captivating and seems
rather the description of a hero of romance than of a character in real
history he was well learnt we are told to fight with the sword
to joust to tourney to wrestle to sing and dance he was an expert
mediciner right crafty in playing both of lute and harp and sundry
other instruments of music and was expert in grammar oratory and
poetry


 ballenden's translation of hector boyce


with this combination of manly and delicate accomplishments fitting him
to shine both in active and elegant life and calculated to give him an
intense relish for joyous existence it must have been a severe trial
in an age of bustle and chivalry to pass the spring-time of his years
in monotonous captivity it was the good fortune of james however to
be gifted with a powerful poetic fancy and to be visited in his prison
by the choicest inspirations of the muse some minds corrode and grow
inactive under the loss of personal liberty others grow morbid
and irritable but it is the nature of the poet to become tender and
imaginative in the loneliness of confinement he banquets upon the honey
of his own thoughts and like the captive bird pours forth his soul in
melody

 have you not seen the nightingale
 a pilgrim coop'd into a cage
 how doth she chant her wonted tale
 in that her lonely hermitage
 even there her charming melody doth prove
 that all her boughs are trees her cage a grove

 roger l'estrange

indeed it is the divine attribute of the imagination that it is
irrepressible unconfinable that when the real world is shut out
it can create a world for itself and with a necromantic power can
conjure up glorious shapes and forms and brilliant visions to make
solitude populous and irradiate the gloom of the dungeon such was the
world of pomp and pageant that lived round tasso in his dismal cell at
ferrara when he conceived the splendid scenes of his jerusalem and we
may consider the king's quair composed by james during his captivity
at windsor as another of those beautiful breakings forth of the soul
from the restraint and gloom of the prison-house

the subject of the poem is his love for the lady jane beaufort daughter
of the earl of somerset and a princess of the blood-royal of england
of whom he became enamoured in the course of his captivity what gives
it a peculiar value is that it may be considered a transcript of
the royal bard's true feelings and the story of his real loves and
fortunes it is not often that sovereigns write poetry or that poets
deal in fact it is gratifying to the pride of a common man to find
a monarch thus suing as it were for admission into his closet and
seeking to win his favor by administering to his pleasures it is a
proof of the honest equality of intellectual competition which strips
off all the trappings of factitious dignity brings the candidate down
to a level with his fellow-men and obliges him to depend on his own
native powers for distinction it is curious too to get at the history
of a monarch's heart and to find the simple affections of human nature
throbbing under the ermine but james had learnt to be a poet before he
was a king he was schooled in adversity and reared in the company of
his own thoughts monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts
or to meditate their minds into poetry and had james been brought up
amidst the adulation and gayety of a court we should never in all
probability have had such a poem as the quair


 quair an old term for book


i have been particularly interested by those parts of the poem which
breathe his immediate thoughts concerning his situation or which are
connected with the apartment in the tower they have thus a personal and
local charm and are given with such circumstantial truth as to make the
reader present with the captive in his prison and the companion of his
meditations

such is the account which he gives of his weariness of spirit and of
the incident which first suggested the idea of writing the poem it was
the still mid-watch of a clear moonlight night the stars he says were
twinkling as fire in the high vault of heaven and cynthia rinsing her
golden locks in aquarius he lay in bed wakeful and restless and took
a book to beguile the tedious hours the book he chose was boetius
consolations of philosophy a work popular among the writers of that
day and which had been translated by his great prototype chaucer from
the high eulogium in which he indulges it is evident this was one of
his favorite volumes while in prison and indeed it is an admirable
text-book for meditation under adversity it is the legacy of a noble
and enduring spirit purified by sorrow and suffering bequeathing to
its successors in calamity the maxims of sweet morality and the trains
of eloquent but simple reasoning by which it was enabled to bear
up against the various ills of life it is a talisman which the
unfortunate may treasure up in his bosom or like the good king james
lay upon his nightly pillow

after closing the volume he turns its contents over in his mind and
gradually falls into a fit of musing on the fickleness of fortune the
vicissitudes of his own life and the evils that had overtaken him even
in his tender youth suddenly he hears the bell ringing to matins but
its sound chiming in with his melancholy fancies seems to him like a
voice exhorting him to write his story in the spirit of poetic errantry
he determines to comply with this intimation he therefore takes pen in
hand makes with it a sign of the cross to implore a benediction
and sallies forth into the fairy-land of poetry there is something
extremely fanciful in all this and it is interesting as furnishing
a striking and beautiful instance of the simple manner in which
whole trains of poetical thought are sometimes awakened and literary
enterprises suggested to the mind

in the course of his poem he more than once bewails the peculiar
hardness of his fate thus doomed to lonely and inactive life and
shut up from the freedom and pleasure of the world in which the meanest
animal indulges unrestrained there is a sweetness however in his very
complaints they are the lamentations of an amiable and social spirit at
being denied the indulgence of its kind and generous propensities there
is nothing in them harsh nor exaggerated they flow with a natural and
touching pathos and are perhaps rendered more touching by their
simple brevity they contrast finely with those elaborate and iterated
repinings which we sometimes meet with in poetry the effusions of
morbid minds sickening under miseries of their own creating and
venting their bitterness upon an unoffending world james speaks of his
privations with acute sensibility but having mentioned them passes on
as if his manly mind disdained to brood over unavoidable calamities
when such a spirit breaks forth into complaint however brief we
are aware how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur we
sympathize with james a romantic active and accomplished prince cut
off in the lustihood of youth from all the enterprise the noble uses
and vigorous delights of life as we do with milton alive to all the
beauties of nature and glories of art when he breathes forth brief but
deep-toned lamentations over his perpetual blindness

had not james evinced a deficiency of poetic artifice we might almost
have suspected that these lowerings of gloomy reflection were meant as
preparative to the brightest scene of his story and to contrast with
that refulgence of light and loveliness that exhilarating accompaniment
of bird and song and foliage and flower and all the revel of the
year with which he ushers in the lady of his heart it is this scene
in particular which throws all the magic of romance about the old
castle keep he had risen he says at daybreak according to custom to
escape from the dreary meditations of a sleepless pillow bewailing in
his chamber thus alone despairing of all joy and remedy for tired
of thought and woe-begone he had wandered to the window to indulge
the captive's miserable solace of gazing wistfully upon the world from
which he is excluded the window looked forth upon a small garden which
lay at the foot of the tower it was a quiet sheltered spot adorned
with arbors and green alleys and protected from the passing gaze by
trees and hawthorn hedges

 now was there made fast by the tower's wall
 a garden faire and in the corners set
 an arbour green with wandis long and small
 railed about and so with leaves beset
 was all the place and hawthorn hedges knet
 that lyf was none walkyng there forbye
 that might within scarce any wight espye

 so thick the branches and the leves grene
 beshaded all the alleys that there were
 and midst of every arbour might be seen
 the sharpe grene swete juniper
 growing so fair with branches here and there
 that as it seemed to a lyf without
 the boughs did spread the arbour all about

 and on the small grene twistis set
 the lytel swete nightingales and sung
 so loud and clear the hymnis consecrate
 of lovis use now soft now loud among
 that all the garden and the wallis rung
 right of their song 


 lyf person

 twistis small boughs or twigs note the language of the
 quotations is generally modernized


it was the month of may when every thing was in bloom and he
interprets the song of the nightingale into the language of his
enamoured feeling

 worship all ye that lovers be this may
 for of your bliss the kalends are begun
 and sing with us away winter away
 come summer come the sweet season and sun

as he gazes on the scene and listens to the notes of the birds he
gradually relapses into one of those tender and undefinable reveries
which fill the youthful bosom in this delicious season he wonders what
this love may be of which he has so often read and which thus seems
breathed forth in the quickening breath of may and melting all nature
into ecstasy and song if it really be so great a felicity and if it be
a boon thus generally dispensed to the most insignificant beings why is
he alone cut off from its enjoyments

 oft would i think o lord what may this be
 that love is of such noble myght and kynde
 loving his folke and such prosperitee
 is it of him as we in books do find
 may he oure hertes setten and unbynd
 hath he upon oure hertes such maistrye
 or is all this but feynit fantasye

 for giff he be of so grete excellence
 that he of every wight hath care and charge
 what have i gilt to him or done offense
 that i am thral'd and birdis go at large


 setten incline

 gilt what injury have i done etc


in the midst of his musing as he casts his eye downward he beholds
the fairest and the freshest young floure that ever he had seen it is
the lovely lady jane walking in the garden to enjoy the beauty of that
fresh may morrowe breaking thus suddenly upon his sight in a moment
of loneliness and excited susceptibility she at once captivates the
fancy of the romantic prince and becomes the object of his wandering
wishes the sovereign of his ideal world

there is in this charming scene an evident resemblance to the early
part of chaucer's knight's tale where palamon and arcite fall in
love with emilia whom they see walking in the garden of their prison
perhaps the similarity of the actual fact to the incident which he had
read in chaucer may have induced james to dwell on it in his poem his
description of the lady jane is given in the picturesque and minute
manner of his master and being doubtless taken from the life is a
perfect portrait of a beauty of that day he dwells with the fondness
of a lover on every article of her apparel from the net of pearl
splendent with emeralds and sapphires that confined her golden hair
even to the goodly chaine of small orfeverye about her neck whereby
there hung a ruby in shape of a heart that seemed he says like a
spark of fire burning upon her white bosom her dress of white
tissue was looped up to enable her to walk with more freedom she was
accompanied by two female attendants and about her sported a little
hound decorated with bells probably the small italian hound of
exquisite symmetry which was a parlor favorite and pet among the
fashionable dames of ancient times james closes his description by a
burst of general eulogium

 in her was youth beauty with humble port
 bounty richesse and womanly feature
 god better knows than my pen can report
 wisdom largesse estate and cunning sure
 in every point so guided her measure
 in word in deed in shape in countenance
 that nature might no more her child advance


 wrought gold

 largesse bounty

 estate dignity

 cunning discretion


the departure of the lady jane from the garden puts an end to this
transient riot of the heart with her departs the amorous illusion
that had shed a temporary charm over the scene of his captivity and he
relapses into loneliness now rendered tenfold more intolerable by this
passing beam of unattainable beauty through the long and weary day he
repines at his unhappy lot and when evening approaches and phoebus
as he beautifully expresses it had bade farewell to every leaf and
flower he still lingers at the window and laying his head upon the
cold stone gives vent to a mingled flow of love and sorrow until
gradually lulled by the mute melancholy of the twilight hour he lapses
half-sleeping half swoon into a vision which occupies the remainder
of the poem and in which is allegorically shadowed out the history of
his passion

when he wakes from his trance he rises from his stony pillow and
pacing his apartment full of dreary reflections questions his spirit
whither it has been wandering whether indeed all that has
passed before his dreaming fancy has been conjured up by preceding
circumstances or whether it is a vision intended to comfort and assure
him in his despondency if the latter he prays that some token may be
sent to confirm the promise of happier days given him in his slumbers
suddenly a turtledove of the purest whiteness comes flying in at the
window and alights upon his hand bearing in her bill a branch of red
gilliflower on the leaves of which is written in letters of gold the
following sentence

 awake awake i bring lover i bring
 the newis glad that blissful is and sure
 of thy comfort now laugh and play and sing
 for in the heaven decretit is thy cure

he receives the branch with mingled hope and dread reads it with
rapture and this he says was the first token of his succeeding
happiness whether this is a mere poetic fiction or whether the lady
jane did actually send him a token of her favor in this romantic way
remains to be determined according to the fate or fancy of the reader
he concludes his poem by intimating that the promise conveyed in the
vision and by the flower is fulfilled by his being restored to liberty
and made happy in the possession of the sovereign of his heart

such is the poetical account given by james of his love adventures
in windsor castle how much of it is absolute fact and how much the
embellishment of fancy it is fruitless to conjecture let us not
however reject every romantic incident as incompatible with real life
but let us sometimes take a poet at his word i have noticed merely
those parts of the poem immediately connected with the tower and have
passed over a large part which was in the allegorical vein so
much cultivated at that day the language of course is quaint and
antiquated so that the beauty of many of its golden phrases will
scarcely be perceived at the present day but it is impossible not to
be charmed with the genuine sentiment the delightful artlessness and
urbanity which prevail throughout it the descriptions of nature too
with which it is embellished are given with a truth a discrimination
and a freshness worthy of the most cultivated periods of the art

as an amatory poem it is edifying in these days of coarser thinking
to notice the nature refinement and exquisite delicacy which
pervade it banishing every gross thought or immodest expression and
presenting female loveliness clothed in all its chivalrous attributes
of almost supernatural purity and grace

james flourished nearly about the time of chaucer and gower and was
evidently an admirer and studier of their writings indeed in one of
his stanzas he acknowledges them as his masters and in some parts
of his poem we find traces of similarity to their productions more
especially to those of chaucer there are always however general
features of resemblance in the works of contemporary authors which are
not so much borrowed from each other as from the times writers like
bees toll their sweets in the wide world they incorporate with their
own conceptions the anecdotes and thoughts current in society and thus
each generation has some features in common characteristic of the age
in which it lives

james belongs to one of the most brilliant eras of our literary history
and establishes the claims of his country to a participation in
its primitive honors whilst a small cluster of english writers are
constantly cited as the fathers of our verse the name of their
great scottish compeer is apt to be passed over in silence but he
is evidently worthy of being enrolled in that little constellation of
remote but never-failing luminaries who shine in the highest firmament
of literature and who like morning stars sang together at the bright
dawning of british poesy

such of my readers as may not be familiar with scottish history though
the manner in which it has of late been woven with captivating fiction
has made it a universal study may be curious to learn something of the
subsequent history of james and the fortunes of his love his passion
for the lady jane as it was the solace of his captivity so it
facilitated his release it being imagined by the court that a
connection with the blood-royal of england would attach him to its own
interests he was ultimately restored to his liberty and crown having
previously espoused the lady jane who accompanied him to scotland and
made him a most tender and devoted wife

he found his kingdom in great confusion the feudal chieftains
having taken advantage of the troubles and irregularities of a long
interregnum to strengthen themselves in their possessions and place
themselves above the power of the laws james sought to found the basis
of his power in the affections of his people he attached the lower
orders to him by the reformation of abuses the temperate and equable
administration of justice the encouragement of the arts of peace and
the promotion of every thing that could diffuse comfort competency
and innocent enjoyment through the humblest ranks of society he
mingled occasionally among the common people in disguise visited
their firesides entered into their cares their pursuits and their
amusements informed himself of the mechanical arts and how they could
best be patronized and improved and was thus an all-pervading spirit
watching with a benevolent eye over the meanest of his subjects having
in this generous manner made himself strong in the hearts of the common
people he turned himself to curb the power of the factious nobility
to strip them of those dangerous immunities which they had usurped to
punish such as had been guilty of flagrant offences and to bring the
whole into proper obedience to the crown for some time they bore
this with outward submission but with secret impatience and brooding
resentment a conspiracy was at length formed against his life at the
head of which was his own uncle robert stewart earl of athol who
being too old himself for the perpetration of the deed of blood
instigated his grandson sir robert stewart together with sir robert
graham and others of less note to commit the deed they broke into his
bedchamber at the dominican convent near perth where he was residing
and barbarously murdered him by oft-repeated wounds his faithful queen
rushing to throw her tender body between him and the sword was twice
wounded in the ineffectual attempt to shield him from the assassin and
it was not until she had been forcibly torn from his person that the
murder was accomplished

it was the recollection of this romantic tale of former times and of
the golden little poem which had its birthplace in this tower that
made me visit the old pile with more than common interest the suit
of armor hanging up in the hall richly gilt and embellished as if to
figure in the tourney brought the image of the gallant and romantic
prince vividly before my imagination i paced the deserted chambers
where he had composed his poem i leaned upon the window and endeavored
to persuade myself it was the very one where he had been visited by
his vision i looked out upon the spot where he had first seen the lady
jane it was the same genial and joyous month the birds were again
vying with each other in strains of liquid melody every thing was
bursting into vegetation and budding forth the tender promise of the
year time which delights to obliterate the sterner memorials of human
pride seems to have passed lightly over this little scene of poetry and
love and to have withheld his desolating hand several centuries have
gone by yet the garden still flourishes at the foot of the tower it
occupies what was once the moat of the keep and though some parts have
been separated by dividing walls yet others have still their arbors
and shaded walks as in the days of james and the whole is sheltered
blooming and retired there is a charm about the spot that has been
printed by the footsteps of departed beauty and consecrated by the
inspirations of the poet which is heightened rather than impaired by
the lapse of ages it is indeed the gift of poetry to hallow every
place in which it moves to breathe around nature an odor more exquisite
than the perfume of the rose and to shed over it a tint more magical
than the blush of morning

others may dwell on the illustrious deeds of james as a warrior and a
legislator but i have delighted to view him merely as the companion
of his fellow-men the benefactor of the human heart stooping from his
high estate to sow the sweet flowers of poetry and song in the paths of
common life he was the first to cultivate the vigorous and hardy plant
of scottish genius which has since become so prolific of the most
wholesome and highly flavored fruit he carried with him into the
sterner regions of the north all the fertilizing arts of southern
refinement he did every thing in his power to win his countrymen to the
gay the elegant and gentle arts which soften and refine the character
of a people and wreathe a grace round the loftiness of a proud and
warlike spirit he wrote many poems which unfortunately for the
fulness of his fame are now lost to the world one which is still
preserved called christ's kirk of the green shows how diligently he
had made himself acquainted with the rustic sports and pastimes which
constitute such a source of kind and social feeling among the scottish
peasantry and with what simple and happy humor he could enter into
their enjoyments he contributed greatly to improve the national music
and traces of his tender sentiment and elegant taste are said to exist
in those witching airs still piped among the wild mountains and lonely
glens of scotland he has thus connected his image with whatever is most
gracious and endearing in the national character he has embalmed his
memory in song and floated his name to after-ages in the rich streams
of scottish melody the recollection of these things was kindling at my
heart as i paced the silent scene of his imprisonment i have visited
vaucluse with as much enthusiasm as a pilgrim would visit the shrine
at loretto but i have never felt more poetical devotion than when
contemplating the old tower and the little garden at windsor and
musing over the romantic loves of the lady jane and the royal poet of
scotland




the country church

 a gentleman
 what o the woolpack or the sugar-chest
 or lists of velvet which is t pound or yard
 you vend your gentry by
 beggar's bush

there are few places more favorable to the study of character than an
english country church i was once passing a few weeks at the seat of
a friend who resided in the vicinity of one the appearance of which
particularly struck my fancy it was one of those rich morsels of quaint
antiquity which gives such a peculiar charm to english landscape
it stood in the midst of a country filled with ancient families and
contained within its cold and silent aisles the congregated dust of many
noble generations the interior walls were encrusted with monuments
of every age and style the light streamed through windows dimmed with
armorial bearings richly emblazoned in stained glass in various parts
of the church were tombs of knights and highborn dames of gorgeous
workmanship with their effigies in colored marble on every side the
eye was struck with some instance of aspiring mortality some haughty
memorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust in this
temple of the most humble of all religions

the congregation was composed of the neighboring people of rank who sat
in pews sumptuously lined and cushioned furnished with richly-gilded
prayer-books and decorated with their arms upon the pew doors of the
villagers and peasantry who filled the back seats and a small gallery
beside the organ and of the poor of the parish who were ranged on
benches in the aisles

the service was performed by a snuffling well-fed vicar who had a snug
dwelling near the church he was a privileged guest at all the tables
of the neighborhood and had been the keenest fox-hunter in the country
until age and good living had disabled him from doing anything more than
ride to see the hounds throw off and make one at the hunting dinner

under the ministry of such a pastor i found it impossible to get into
the train of thought suitable to the time and place so having like
many other feeble christians compromised with my conscience by laying
the sin of my own delinquency at another person's threshold i occupied
myself by making observations on my neighbors

i was as yet a stranger in england and curious to notice the manners
of its fashionable classes i found as usual that there was the least
pretension where there was the most acknowledged title to respect i was
particularly struck for instance with the family of a nobleman of high
rank consisting of several sons and daughters nothing could be more
simple and unassuming than their appearance they generally came to
church in the plainest equipage and often on foot the young ladies
would stop and converse in the kindest manner with the peasantry caress
the children 
and listen to the stories of the humble cottagers their
countenances were open and beautifully fair with an expression of
high refinement but at the same time a frank cheerfulness and engaging
affability their brothers were tall and elegantly formed they were
dressed fashionably but simply with strict neatness and propriety but
without any mannerism or foppishness their whole demeanor was easy
and natural with that lofty grace and noble frankness which bespeak
free-born souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings
of inferiority there is a healthful hardiness about real dignity that
never dreads contact and communion with others however humble it is
only spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive and shrinks from every
touch i was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with
the peasantry about those rural concerns and field-sports in which the
gentlemen of the country so much delight in these conversations there
was neither haughtiness on the one part nor servility on the other and
you were only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect
of the peasant

in contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen who had
amassed a vast fortune and having purchased the estate and mansion of
a ruined nobleman in the neighborhood was endeavoring to assume all the
style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil the family always
came to church en prince they were rolled majestically along in a
carriage emblazoned with arms the crest glittered in silver radiance
from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed
a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat richly laced and a flaxen wig
curling close round his rosy face was seated on the box with a sleek
danish dog beside him two footmen in gorgeous liveries with huge
bouquets and gold-headed canes lolled behind the carriage rose and
sunk on its long springs with a peculiar stateliness of motion the very
horses champed their bits arched their necks and glanced their eyes
more proudly than common horses either because they had caught a little
of the family feeling or were reined up more tightly than ordinary

i could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant
was brought up to the gate of the churchyard there was a vast effect
produced at the turning of an angle of the wall a great smacking of the
whip straining and scrambling of the horses glistening of harness and
flashing of wheels through gravel this was the moment of triumph and
vainglory to the coachman the horses were urged and checked until they
were fretted into a foam they threw out their feet in a prancing trot
dashing about pebbles at every step the crowd of villagers sauntering
quietly to church opened precipitately to the right and left gaping in
vacant admiration on reaching the gate the horses were pulled up with
a suddenness that produced an immediate stop and almost threw them on
their haunches

there was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight pull down the
steps and prepare everything for the descent on earth of this august
family the old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the
door looking about him with the pompous air of a man accustomed to rule
on change and shake the stock market with a nod his consort a fine
fleshy comfortable dame followed him there seemed i must confess
but little pride in her composition she was the picture of broad
honest vulgar enjoyment the world went well with her and she liked
the world she had fine clothes a fine house a fine carriage fine
children everything was fine about her it was nothing but driving
about and visiting and feasting life was to her a perpetual revel it
was one long lord mayor's day

two daughters succeeded to this goodly couple they certainly were
handsome but had a supercilious air that chilled admiration and
disposed the spectator to be critical they were ultrafashionable in
dress and though no one could deny the richness of their decorations
yet their appropriateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of
a country church they descended loftily from the carriage and moved up
the line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod
on they cast an excursive glance around that passed coldly over the
burly faces of the peasantry until they met the eyes of the nobleman's
family when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles and
they made the most profound and elegant courtesies which were returned
in a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances

i must not forget the two sons of this inspiring citizen who came to
church in a dashing curricle with outriders they were arrayed in the
extremity of the mode with all that pedantry of dress which marks
the man of questionable pretensions to style they kept entirely by
themselves eying every one askance that came near them as if measuring
his claims to respectability yet they were without conversation except
the exchange of an occasional cant phrase they even moved artificially
for their bodies in compliance with the caprice of the day had been
disciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom art had done
everything to accomplish them as men of fashion but nature had denied
them the nameless grace they were vulgarly shaped like men formed for
the common purposes of life and had that air of supercilious assumption
which is never seen in the true gentleman

i have been rather minute in drawing the pictures of these two families
because i considered them specimens of what is often to be met with in
this country the unpretending great and the arrogant little i have no
respect for titled rank unless it be accompanied with true nobility
of soul but i have remarked in all countries where artificial
distinctions exist that the very highest classes are always the most
courteous and unassuming those who are well assured of their own
standing are least apt to trespass on that of others whereas nothing
is so offensive as the aspirings of vulgarity which thinks to elevate
itself by humiliating its neighbor

as i have brought these families into contrast i must notice their
behavior in church that of the nobleman's family was quiet serious
and attentive not that they appeared to have any fervor of devotion
but rather a respect for sacred things and sacred places inseparable
from good-breeding the others on the contrary were in a perpetual
flutter and whisper they betrayed a continual consciousness of finery
and the sorry ambition of being the wonders of a rural congregation

the old gentleman was the only one really attentive to the service he
took the whole burden of family devotion upon himself standing bolt
upright and uttering the responses with a loud voice that might be
heard all over the church it was evident that he was one of these
thorough church-and-king men who connect the idea of devotion and
loyalty who consider the deity somehow or other of the government
party and religion a very excellent sort of thing that ought to be
countenanced and kept up

when he joined so loudly in the service it seemed more by way of
example to the lower orders to show them that though so great and
wealthy he was not above being religious as i have seen a turtle-fed
alderman swallow publicly a basin of charity soup smacking his lips at
every mouthful and pronouncing it excellent food for the poor

when the service was at an end i was curious to witness the several
exits of my groups the young noblemen and their sisters as the day
was fine preferred strolling home across the fields chatting with the
country people as they went the others departed as they came in grand
parade again were the equipages wheeled up to the gate there was again
the smacking of whips the clattering of hoofs and the glittering of
harness the horses started off almost at a bound the villagers again
hurried to right and left the wheels threw up a cloud of dust and the
aspirin family was rapt out of sight in a whirlwind




the widow and her son

 pittie olde age within whose silver haires
 honour and reverence evermore have rain'd
 marlowe's tamburlaine

those who are in the habit of remarking such matters must have noticed
the passive quiet of an english landscape on sunday the clacking of
the mill the regularly recurring stroke of the flail the din of the
blacksmith's hammer the whistling of the ploughman the rattling of
the cart and all other sounds of rural labor are suspended the
very farm-dogs bark less frequently being less disturbed by passing
travellers at such times i have almost fancied the wind sunk into
quiet and that the sunny landscape with its fresh green tints melting
into blue haze enjoyed the hallowed calm

 sweet day so pure so calm so brigh
 the bridal of the earth and sky

well was it ordained that the day of devotion should be a day of rest
the holy repose which reigns over the face of nature has its moral
influence every restless passion is charmed down and we feel the
natural religion of the soul gently springing up within us for my
part there are feelings that visit me in a country church amid the
beautiful serenity of nature which i experience nowhere else and if
not a more religious i think i am a better man on sunday than on any
other day of the seven

during my recent residence in the country i used frequently to attend
at the old village church its shadowy aisles its mouldering monuments
its dark oaken panelling all reverend with the gloom of departed years
seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation but being in a
wealthy aristocratic neighborhood the glitter of fashion penetrated
even into the sanctuary and i felt myself continually thrown back upon
the world by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me the
only being in the whole congregation who appeared thoroughly to feel the
humble and prostrate piety of a true christian was a poor decrepit old
woman bending under the weight of years and infirmities she bore the
traces of something better than abject poverty the lingerings of decent
pride were visible in her appearance her dress though humble in the
extreme was scrupulously clean some trivial respect too had been
awarded her for she did not take her seat among the village poor but
sat alone on the steps of the altar she seemed to have survived all
love all friendship all society and to have nothing left her but the
hopes of heaven when i saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form
in prayer habitually conning her prayer-book which her palsied hand
and failing eyes could not permit her to read but which she evidently
knew by heart i felt persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor
woman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk the swell
of the organ or the chanting of the choir

i am fond of loitering about country churches and this was so
delightfully situated that it frequently attracted me it stood on a
knoll round which a small stream made a beautiful bend and then wound
its way through a long reach of soft meadow scenery the church was
surrounded by yew trees which seemed almost coeval with itself its
tall gothic spire shot up lightly from among them with rooks and crows
generally wheeling about it i was seated there one still sunny morning
watching two laborers who were digging a grave they had chosen one of
the most remote and neglected corners of the churchyard where from the
number of nameless graves around it would appear that the indigent and
friendless were huddled into the earth i was told that the new-made
grave was for the only son of a poor widow while i was meditating on
the distinctions of worldly rank which extend thus down into the very
dust the toll of the bell announced the approach of the funeral they
were the obsequies of poverty with which pride had nothing to do a
coffin of the plainest materials without pall or other covering was
borne by some of the villagers the sexton walked before with an air
of cold indifference there were no mock mourners in the trappings of
affected woe but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after
the corpse it was the aged mother of the deceased the poor old woman
whom i had seen seated on the steps of the altar she was supported by
a humble friend who was endeavoring to comfort her a few of the
neighboring poor had joined the train and some children of the village
were running hand in hand now shouting with unthinking mirth and now
pausing to gaze with childish curiosity on the grief of the mourner

as the funeral train approached the grave the parson issued from the
church-porch arrayed in the surplice with prayer-book in hand and
attended by the clerk the service however was a mere act of charity
the deceased had been destitute and the survivor was penniless it
was shuffled through therefore in form but coldly and unfeeling the
well-fed priest moved but a few steps from the church door his voice
could scarcely be heard at the grave and never did i hear the funeral
service that sublime and touching ceremony turned into such a frigid
mummery of words

i approached the grave the coffin was placed on the ground on it were
inscribed the name and age of the deceased george somers aged 
years the poor mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head
of it her withered hands were clasped as if in prayer but i could
perceive by a feeble rocking of the body and a convulsive motion of
the lips that she was gazing on the last relics of her son with the
yearnings of a mother's heart

preparations were made to deposit the coffin in the earth there was
that bustling stir which breaks so harshly on the feelings of grief and
affection directions given in the cold tones of business the striking
of spades into sand and gravel which at the grave of those we love
is of all sounds the most withering the bustle around seemed to
waken the mother from a wretched revery she raised her glazed eyes and
looked about with a faint wildness as the men approached with cords to
lower the coffin into the grave she wrung her hands and broke into
an agony of grief the poor woman who attended her took her by the arm
endeavoring to raise her from the earth and to whisper something like
consolation nay now nay now don't take it so sorely to heart
she could only shake her head and wring her hands as one not to be
comforted

as they lowered the body into the earth the creaking of the cords
seemed to agonize her but when on some accidental obstruction there
was a jostling of the coffin all the tenderness of the mother burst
forth as if any harm could come to him who was far beyond the reach of
worldly suffering

i could see no more my heart swelled into my throat my eyes filled
with tears i felt as if i were acting a barbarous part in standing by
and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish i wandered to another
part of the churchyard where i remained until the funeral train had
dispersed

when i saw the mother slowly and painfully quitting the grave leaving
behind her the remains of all that was dear to her on earth and
returning to silence and destitution my heart ached for her what
thought i are the distresses of the rich they have friends to
soothe pleasures to beguile a world to divert and dissipate their
griefs what are the sorrows of the young their growing minds soon
close above the wound their elastic spirits soon rise beneath the
pressure their green and ductile affections soon twine round new
objects but the sorrows of the poor who have no outward appliances to
soothe the sorrows of the aged with whom life at best is but a wintry
day and who can look for no after-growth of joy the sorrows of a
widow aged solitary destitute mourning over an only son the last
solace of her years these are indeed sorrows which make us feel the
impotency of consolation

it was some time before i left the churchyard on my way homeward i met
with the woman who had acted as comforter she was just returning from
accompanying the mother to her lonely habitation and i drew from her
some particulars connected with the affecting scene i had witnessed

the parents of the deceased had resided in the village from childhood
they had inhabited one of the neatest cottages and by various rural
occupations and the assistance of a small garden had supported
themselves creditably and comfortably and led a happy and a blameless
life they had one son who had grown up to be the staff and pride of
their age oh sir said the good woman he was such a comely lad
so sweet-tempered so kind to every one around him so dutiful to his
parents it did one's heart good to see him of a sunday drest out in
his best so tall so straight so cheery supporting his old mother to
church for she was always fonder of leaning on george's arm than on her
good man's and poor soul she might well be proud of him for a finer
lad there was not in the country round

unfortunately the son was tempted during a year of scarcity and
agricultural hardship to enter into the service of one of the small
craft that plied on a neighboring river he had not been long in this
employ when he was entrapped by a press-gang and carried off to sea
his parents received tidings of his seizure but beyond that they could
learn nothing it was the loss of their main prop the father who was
already infirm grew heartless and melancholy and sunk into his grave
the widow left lonely in her age and feebleness could no longer
support herself and came upon the parish still there was a kind
feeling towards her throughout the village and a certain respect as
being one of the oldest inhabitants as no one applied for the cottage
in which she had passed so many happy days she was permitted to remain
in it where she lived solitary and almost helpless the few wants of
nature were chiefly supplied from the scanty productions of her little
garden which the neighbors would now and then cultivate for her it was
but a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told
me that she was gathering some vegetables for her repast when she
heard the cottage-door which faced the garden suddenly opened a
stranger came out and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around
he was dressed in seamen's clothes was emaciated and ghastly pale and
bore the air of one broken by sickness and hardships he saw her and
hastened towards her but his steps were faint and faltering he sank on
his knees before her and sobbed like a child the poor woman gazed upon
him with a vacant and wandering eye oh my dear dear mother don't
you know your son your poor boy george it was indeed the wreck
of her once noble lad who shattered by wounds by sickness and foreign
imprisonment had at length dragged his wasted limbs homeward to
repose among the scenes of his childhood

i will not attempt to detail the particulars of such a meeting where
sorrow and joy were so completely blended still he was alive he was
come home he might yet live to comfort and cherish her old age nature
however was exhausted in him and if any thing had been wanting to
finish the work of fate the desolation of his native cottage would have
been sufficient he stretched himself on the pallet on which his widowed
mother had passed many a sleepless night and he never rose from it
again

the villagers when they heard that george somers had returned crowded
to see him offering every comfort and assistance that their humble
means afforded he was too weak however to talk he could only
look his thanks his mother was his constant attendant and he seemed
unwilling to be helped by any other hand

there is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood
that softens the heart and brings it back to the feelings of infancy
who that has languished even in advanced life in sickness and
despondency who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and
loneliness of a foreign land but has thought on the mother that looked
on his childhood that smoothed his pillow and administered to his
helplessness oh there is an enduring tenderness in the love of a
mother to a son that transcends all other affections of the heart
it is neither to be chilled by selfishness nor daunted by danger
nor weakened by worthlessness nor stifled by ingratitude she will
sacrifice every comfort to his convenience she will surrender every
pleasure to his enjoyment she will glory in his fame and exult in his
prosperity and if misfortune overtake him he will be the dearer to
her from misfortune and if disgrace settle upon his name she will
still love and cherish him in spite of his disgrace and if all the
world beside cast him off she will be all the world to him

poor george somers had known what it was to be in sickness and none to
soothe lonely and in prison and none to visit him he could not endure
his mother from his sight if she moved away his eye would follow her
she would sit for hours by his bed watching him as he slept sometimes
he would start from a feverish dream and look anxiously up until he saw
her bending over him when he would take her hand lay it on his bosom
and fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child in this way he died

my first impulse on hearing this humble tale of affliction was to visit
the cottage of the mourner and administer pecuniary assistance and if
possible comfort i found however on inquiry that the good feelings
of the villagers had prompted them to do everything that the case
admitted and as the poor know best how to console each other's sorrows
i did not venture to intrude

the next sunday i was at the village church when to my surprise i saw
the poor old woman tottering down the aisle to her accustomed seat on
the steps of the altar

she had made an effort to put on something like mourning for her son
and nothing could be more touching than this struggle between pious
affection and utter poverty a black ribbon or so a faded black
handkerchief and one or two more such humble attempts to express by
outward signs that grief which passes show when i looked round upon
the storied monuments the stately hatchments the cold marble pomp with
which grandeur mourned magnificently over departed pride and turned to
this poor widow bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her god
and offering up the prayers and praises of a pious though a broken
heart i felt that this living monument of real grief was worth them
all

i related her story to some of the wealthy members of the congregation
and they were moved by it they exerted themselves to render her
situation more comfortable and to lighten her afflictions it was
however but smoothing a few steps to the grave in the course of a
sunday or two after she was missed from her usual seat at church and
before i left the neighborhood i heard with a feeling of satisfaction
that she had quietly breathed her last and had gone to rejoin those she
loved in that world where sorrow is never known and friends are never
parted




a sunday in london

 part of a sketch omitted in the preceding editions


in a preceding paper i have spoken of an english sunday in the country
and its tranquillizing effect upon the landscape but where is its
sacred influence more strikingly apparent than in the very heart of that
great babel london on this sacred day the gigantic monster is charmed
into repose the intolerable din and struggle of the week are at an
end the shops are shut the fires of forges and manufactories are
extinguished and the sun no longer obscured by murky clouds of smoke
pours down a sober yellow radiance into the quiet streets the
few pedestrians we meet instead of hurrying forward with anxious
countenances move leisurely along their brows are smoothed from the
wrinkles of business and care they have put on their sunday looks and
sunday manners with their sunday clothes and are cleansed in mind as
well as in person

and now the melodious clangor of bells from church towers summons their
several flocks to the fold forth issues from his mansion the family
of the decent tradesman the small children in the advance then the
citizen and his comely spouse followed by the grown-up daughters
with small morocco-bound prayer-books laid in the folds of their
pocket-handkerchiefs the housemaid looks after them from the window
admiring the finery of the family and receiving perhaps a nod and
smile from her young mistresses at whose toilet she has assisted

now rumbles along the carriage of some magnate of the city peradventure
an alderman or a sheriff and now the patter of many feet announces it
procession of charity scholars in uniforms of antique cut and each with
a prayer-book under his arm

the ringing of bells is at an end the rumbling of the carriage has
ceased the pattering of feet is heard no more the flocks are folded
in ancient churches cramped up in by-lanes and corners of the crowded
city where the vigilant beadle keeps watch like the shepherd's dog
round the threshold of the sanctuary for a time everything is hushed
but soon is heard the deep pervading sound of the organ rolling and
vibrating through the empty lanes and courts and the sweet chanting of
the choir making them resound with melody and praise never have i been
more sensible of the sanctifying effect of church music than when i
have heard it thus poured forth like a river of joy through the inmost
recesses of this great metropolis elevating it as it were from all
the sordid pollutions of the week and bearing the poor world-worn soul
on a tide of triumphant harmony to heaven

the morning service is at an end the streets are again alive with the
congregations returning to their homes but soon again relapse into
silence now comes on the sunday dinner which to the city tradesman
is a meal of some importance there is more leisure for social enjoyment
at the board members of the family can now gather together who are
separated by the laborious occupations of the week a school-boy may be
permitted on that day to come to the paternal home an old friend of
the family takes his accustomed sunday seat at the board tells over
his well-known stories and rejoices young and old with his well-known
jokes

on sunday afternoon the city pours forth its lesions to breathe the
fresh air and enjoy the sunshine of the parks and rural environs
satirists may say what they please about the rural enjoyments of a
london citizen on sunday but to me there is something delightful in
beholding the poor prisoner of the crowded and dusty city enabled thus
to come forth once a week and throw himself upon the green bosom of
nature he is like a child restored to the mother's breast and they
who first spread out these noble parks and magnificent pleasure-grounds
which surround this huge metropolis have done at least as much for
its health and morality as if they had expended the amount of cost in
hospitals prisons and penitentiaries




the boar's head tavern eastcheap

a shakespearian research

a tavern is the rendezvous the exchange the staple of good fellows
i have heard my great-grandfather tell how his great-great-grandfather
should say that it was an old proverb when his great-grandfather was a
child that it was a good wind that blew a man to the wine

mother bombie

it is a pious custom in some catholic countries to honor the memory of
saints by votive lights burnt before their pictures the popularity of
a saint therefore may be known by the number of these offerings
one perhaps is left to moulder in the darkness of his little chapel
another may have a solitary lamp to throw its blinking rays athwart his
effigy while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine
of some beatified father of renown the wealthy devotee brings his huge
luminary of wax the eager zealot his seven-branched candlestick and
even the mendicant pilgrim is by no means satisfied that sufficient
light is thrown upon the deceased unless he hangs up his little lamp
of smoking oil the consequence is that in the eagerness to enlighten
they are often apt to obscure and i have occasionally seen an unlucky
saint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his
followers

in like manner has it fared with the immortal shakespeare every writer
considers it his bounden duty to light up some portion of his character
or works and to rescue some merit from oblivion the commentator
opulent in words produces vast tomes of dissertations the common herd
of editors send up mists of obscurity from their notes at the bottom of
each page and every casual scribbler brings his farthing rushlight of
eulogy or research to swell the cloud of incense and of smoke

as i honor all established usages of my brethren of the quill i thought
it but proper to contribute my mite of homage to the memory of the
illustrious bard i was for some time however sorely puzzled in what
way i should discharge this duty i found myself anticipated in every
attempt at a new reading every doubtful line had been explained a dozen
different ways and perplexed beyond the reach of elucidation and as
to fine passages they had all been amply praised by previous admirers
nay so completely had the bard of late been overlarded with panegyric
by a great german critic that it was difficult now to find even a fault
that had not been argued into a beauty

in this perplexity i was one morning turning over his pages when i
casually opened upon the comic scenes of henry iv and was in a
moment completely lost in the madcap revelry of the boar's head tavern
so vividly and naturally are these scenes of humor depicted and with
such force and consistency are the characters sustained that they
become mingled up in the mind with the facts and personages of real
life to few readers does it occur that these are all ideal creations
of a poet's brain and that in sober truth no such knot of merry
roisterers ever enlivened the dull neighborhood of eastcheap

for my part i love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry a hero
of fiction that never existed is just as valuable to me as a hero of
history that existed a thousand years since and if i may be excused
such an insensibility to the common ties of human nature i would not
give up fat jack for half the great men of ancient chronicle what
have the heroes of yore done for me or men like me they have conquered
countries of which i do not enjoy an acre or they have gained laurels
of which i do not inherit a leaf or they have furnished examples of
hair-brained prowess which i have neither the opportunity nor the
inclination to follow but old jack falstaff kind jack falstaff sweet
jack falstaff has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment he has
added vast regions of wit and good-humor in which the poorest man may
revel and has bequeathed a never-failing inheritance of jolly laughter
to make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity

a thought suddenly struck me i will make a pilgrimage to eastcheap
said i closing the book and see if the old boar's head tavern still
exists who knows but i may light upon some legendary traces of dame
quickly and her guests at any rate there will be a kindred pleasure in
treading the halls once vocal with their mirth to that the toper enjoys
in smelling to the empty cask once filled with generous wine

the resolution was no sooner formed than put in execution i forbear to
treat of the various adventures and wonders i encountered in my travels
of the haunted regions of cock lane of the faded glories of little
britain and the parts adjacent what perils i ran in cateaton street
and old jewry of the renowned guildhall and its two stunted giants the
pride and wonder of the city and the terror of all unlucky urchins and
how i visited london stone and struck my staff upon it in imitation of
that arch-rebel jack cade

let it suffice to say that i at length arrived in merry eastcheap that
ancient region of wit and wassail where the very names of the streets
relished of good cheer as pudding lane bears testimony even at the
present day for eastcheap says old stow was always famous for its
convivial doings the cookes cried hot ribbes of beef roasted pies well
baked and other victuals there was clattering of pewter pots harpe
pipe and sawtrie alas how sadly is the scene changed since the
roaring days of falstaff and old stow the madcap roisterer has given
place to the plodding tradesman the clattering of pots and the sound of
harpe and sawtrie to the din of carts and the accurst dinging of the
dustman's bell and no song is heard save haply the strain of some
syren from billingsgate chanting the eulogy of deceased mackerel

i sought in vain for the ancient abode of dame quickly the only
relict of it is a boar's head carved in relief in stone which formerly
served as the sign but at present is built into the parting line of two
houses which stand on the site of the renowned old tavern

for the history of this little abode of good fellowship i was referred
to a tallow-chandler's widow opposite who had been born and brought up
on the spot and was looked up to as the indisputable chronicler of the
neighborhood i found her seated in a little back parlor the window
of which looked out upon a yard about eight feet square laid out as a
flower-garden while a glass door opposite afforded a distant view of
the street through a vista of soap and tallow candles the two views
which comprised in all probability her prospects in life and the
little world in which she had lived and moved and had her being for the
better part of a century

to be versed in the history of eastcheap great and little from london
stone even unto the monument was doubtless in her opinion to be
acquainted with the history of the universe yet with all this she
possessed the simplicity of true wisdom and that liberal communicative
disposition which i have generally remarked in intelligent old ladies
knowing in the concerns of their neighborhood

her information however did not extend far back into antiquity she
could throw no light upon the history of the boar's head from the time
that dame quickly espoused the valiant pistol until the great fire of
london when it was unfortunately burnt down it was soon rebuilt
and continued to flourish under the old name and sign until a dying
landlord struck with remorse for double scores bad measures and
other iniquities which are incident to the sinful race of publicans
endeavored to make his peace with heaven by bequeathing the tavern to
st michael's church crooked lane toward the supporting of a chaplain
for some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there but it
was observed that the old boar never held up his head under church
government he gradually declined and finally gave his last gasp about
thirty years since the tavern was then turned into shops but she
informed me that a picture of it was still preserved in st michael's
church which stood just in the rear to get a sight of this picture
was now my determination so having informed myself of the abode of
the sexton i took my leave of the venerable chronicler of eastcheap my
visit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore
and furnished an important incident in the history of her life

it cost me some difficulty and much curious inquiry to ferret out the
humble hanger-on to the church i had to explore crooked lane and divers
little alleys and elbows and dark passages with which this old city is
perforated like an ancient cheese or a worm-eaten chest of drawers
at length i traced him to a corner of a small court surrounded by lofty
houses where the inhabitants enjoy about as much of the face of heaven
as a community of frogs at the bottom of a well

the sexton was a meek acquiescing little man of a bowing lowly habit
yet he had a pleasant twinkling in his eye and if encouraged would
now and then hazard a small pleasantry such as a man of his low estate
might venture to make in the company of high churchwardens and other
mighty men of the earth i found him in company with the deputy
organist seated apart like milton's angels discoursing no doubt
on high doctrinal points and settling the affairs of the church over a
friendly pot of ale for the lower classes of english seldom deliberate
on any weighty matter without the assistance of a cool tankard to clear
their understandings i arrived at the moment when they had finished
their ale and their argument and were about to repair to the church
to put it in order so having made known my wishes i received their
gracious permission to accompany them

the church of st michael's crooked lane standing a short distance
from billingsgate is enriched with the tombs of many fishmongers
of renown and as every profession has its galaxy of glory and
its constellation of great men i presume the monument of a mighty
fishmonger of the olden time is regarded with as much reverence by
succeeding generations of the craft as poets feel on contemplating the
tomb of virgil or soldiers the monument of a marlborough or turenne

i cannot but turn aside while thus speaking of illustrious men to
observe that st michael's crooked lane contains also the ashes of
that doughty champion william walworth knight who so manfully clove
down the sturdy wight wat tyler in smithfield a hero worthy of
honorable blazon as almost the only lord mayor on record famous for
deeds of arms the sovereigns of cockney being generally renowned as the
most pacific of all potentates


 the following was the ancient inscription on the monument
 of this worthy which unhappily was destroyed in the great
 conflagration

 hereunder lyth a man of fame
 william walworth callyd by name
 fishmonger he was in lyfftime here
 and twise lord maior as in books appere
 who with courage stout and manly myght
 slew jack straw in kyng richard's sight
 for which act done and trew entent
 the kyng made him knyght incontinent
 and gave him armes as here you see
 to declare his fact and chivaldrie
 he left this lyff the yere of our god
 thirteen hundred fourscore and three odd

an error in the foregoing inscription has been corrected by the
venerable stow whereas saith he it hath been far spread abroad by
vulgar opinion that the rebel smitten down so manfully by sir william
walworth the then worthy lord maior was named jack straw and not wat
tyler i thought good to reconcile this rash-conceived doubt by such
testimony as i find in ancient and good records the principal leaders
or captains of the commons were wat tyler as the first man the
second was john or jack straw etc etc stow's london


adjoining the church in a small cemetery immediately under the back
window of what was once the boar's head stands the tombstone of robert
preston whilom drawer at the tavern it is now nearly a century since
this trusty drawer of good liquor closed his bustling career and was
thus quietly deposited within call of his customers as i was clearing
away the weeds from his epitaph the little sexton drew me on one side
with a mysterious air and informed me in a low voice that once upon
a time on a dark wintry night when the wind was unruly howling and
whistling banging about doors and windows and twirling weathercocks
so that the living were frightened out of their beds and even the dead
could not sleep quietly in their graves the ghost of honest preston
which happened to be airing itself in the churchyard was attracted
by the well-known call of waiter from the boar's head and made its
sudden appearance in the midst of a roaring club just as the parish
clerk was singing a stave from the mirre garland of captain death to
the discomfiture of sundry train-band captains and the conversion of an
infidel attorney who became a zealous christian on the spot and
was never known to twist the truth afterwards except in the way of
business

i beg it may be remembered that i do not pledge myself for the
authenticity of this anecdote though it is well known that the
churchyards and by-corners of this old metropolis are very much infested
with perturbed spirits and every one must have heard of the cock lane
ghost and the apparition that guards the regalia in the tower which has
frightened so many bold sentinels almost out of their wits

be all this as it may this robert preston seems to have been a worthy
successor to the nimbletongued francis who attended upon the revels of
prince hal to have been equally prompt with his anon anon sir
and to have transcended his predecessor in honesty for falstaff the
veracity of whose taste no man will venture to impeach flatly accuses
francis of putting lime in his sack whereas honest preston's epitaph
lands him for the sobriety of his conduct the soundness of his wine
and the fairness of his measure the worthy dignitaries of the church
however did not appear much captivated by the sober virtues of the
tapster the deputy organist who had a moist look out of the eye made
some shrewd remark on the abstemiousness of a man brought up among
full hogsheads and the little sexton corroborated his opinion by a
significant wink and a dubious shake of the head


 as this inscription is rife with excellent morality i
 transcribe it for the admonition of delinquent tapsters it
 is no doubt the production of some choice spirit who once
 frequented the boar's head

 bacchus to give the toping world surprise
 produced one sober son and here he lies
 though rear'd among full hogsheads he defy'd
 the charms of wine and every one beside
 o reader if to justice thou rt inclined
 keep honest preston daily in thy mind
 he drew good wine took care to fill his pots
 had sundry virtues that excused his faults
 you that on bacchus have the like dependence
 pray copy bob in measure and attendance


thus far my researches though they threw much light on the history of
tapsters fishmongers and lord mayors yet disappointed me in the
great object of my quest the picture of the boar's head tavern no
such painting was to be found in the church of st michael's marry and
amen said i here endeth my research so i was giving the matter
up with the air of a baffled antiquary when my friend the sexton
perceiving me to be curious in everything relative to the old tavern
offered to show me the choice vessels of the vestry which had been
handed down from remote times when the parish meetings were held at the
boar's head these were deposited in the parish club-room which had
been transferred on the decline of the ancient establishment to a
tavern in the neighborhood

a few steps brought us to the house which stands no miles lane
bearing the title of the mason's arms and is kept by master edward
honeyball the bully-rock of the establishment it is one of those
little taverns which abound in the heart of the city and form the centre
of gossip and intelligence of the neighborhood we entered the barroom
which was narrow and darkling for in these close lanes but few rays of
reflected light are enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants whose
broad day is at best but a tolerable twilight the room was partitioned
into boxes each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth
ready for dinner this showed that the guests were of the good old
stamp and divided their day equally for it was but just one o'clock
at the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire before which a
breast of lamb was roasting a row of bright brass candlesticks and
pewter mugs glistened along the mantelpiece and an old fashioned clock
ticked in one corner there was something primitive in this medley of
kitchen parlor and hall that carried me back to earlier times and
pleased me the place indeed was humble but everything had that look
of order and neatness which bespeaks the superintendence of a notable
english housewife a group of amphibious-looking beings who might be
either fishermen or sailors were regaling themselves in one of the
boxes as i was a visitor of rather higher pretensions i was ushered
into a little misshapen back room having at least nine corners it was
lighted by a sky-light furnished with antiquated leathern chairs and
ornamented with the portrait of a fat pig it was evidently appropriated
to particular customers and i found a shabby gentleman in a red nose
and oil-cloth hat seated in one corner meditating on a half empty pot of
porter

the old sexton had taken the landlady aside and with an air of profound
importance imparted to her my errand dame honeyball was a likely
plump bustling little woman and no bad substitute for that paragon
of hostesses dame quickly she seemed delighted with an opportunity to
oblige and hurrying upstairs to the archives of her house where
the precious vessels of the parish club were deposited she returned
smiling and courtesying with them in her hands

the first she presented me was a japanned iron tobacco-box of gigantic
size out of which i was told the vestry had smoked at their stated
meetings since time immemorial and which was never suffered to be
profaned by vulgar hands or used on common occasions i received it
with becoming reverence but what was my delight at beholding on
its cover the identical painting of which i was in quest there was
displayed the outside of the boar's head tavern and before the door was
to be seen the whole convivial group at table in full revel pictured
with that wonderful fidelity and force with which the portraits of
renowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco-boxes for
the benefit of posterity lest however there should be any mistake
the cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of prince hal and
falstaff on the bottoms of their chairs

on the inside of the cover was an inscription nearly obliterated
recording that this box was the gift of sir richard gore for the use of
the vestry meetings at the boar's head tavern and that it was repaired
and beautified by his successor mr john packard such is a
faithful description of this august and venerable relic and i question
whether the learned scriblerius contemplated his roman shield or
the knights of the round table the long-sought san-greal with more
exultation

while i was meditating on it with enraptured gaze dame honeyball
who was highly gratified by the interest it excited put in my hands
a drinking-cup or goblet which also belonged to the vestry and was
descended from the old boar's head it bore the inscription of having
been the gift of francis wythers knight and was held she told me in
exceeding great value being considered very antyke this last opinion
was strengthened by the shabby gentleman with the red nose and oilcloth
hat and whom i strongly suspected of being a lineal descendant from the
variant bardolph he suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of
porter and casting a knowing look at the goblet exclaimed ay ay
the head don't ache now that made that there article

the great importance attached to this memento of ancient revelry by
modern churchwardens at first puzzled me but there is nothing sharpens
the apprehension so much as antiquarian research for i immediately
perceived that this could be no other than the identical parcel-gilt
goblet on which falstaff made his loving but faithless vow to dame
quickly and which would of course be treasured up with care among the
regalia of her domains as a testimony of that solemn contract


 thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet sitting
 in my dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea-coal
 fire on wednesday in whitsun-week when the prince broke
 thy head for likening his father to a singing man at
 windsor thou didst swear to me then as i was washing thy
 wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife canst
 thou deny it henry iv part 


mine hostess indeed gave me a long history how the goblet had been
handed down from generation to generation she also entertained me
with many particulars concerning the worthy vestrymen who have seated
themselves thus quietly on the stools of the ancient roisterers of
eastcheap and like so many commentators utter clouds of smoke in
honor of shakespeare these i forbear to relate lest my readers should
not be as curious in these matters as myself suffice it to say the
neighbors one and all about eastcheap believe that falstaff and his
merry crew actually lived and revelled there nay there are several
legendary anecdotes concerning him still extant among the oldest
frequenters of the mason's arms which they give as transmitted down
from their forefathers and mr m'kash an irish hair-dresser whose
shop stands on the site of the old boar's head has several dry jokes
of fat jack's not laid down in the books with which he makes his
customers ready to die of laughter

i now turned to my friend the sexton to make some further inquiries but
i found him sunk in pensive meditation his head had declined a little
on one side a deep sigh heaved from the very bottom of his stomach
and though i could not see a tear trembling in his eye yet a moisture
was evidently stealing from a corner of his mouth i followed the
direction of his eye through the door which stood open and found it
fixed wistfully on the savory breast of lamb roasting in dripping
richness before the fire

i now called to mind that in the eagerness of my recondite
investigation i was keeping the poor man from his dinner my bowels
yearned with sympathy and putting in his hand a small token of my
gratitude and goodness i departed with a hearty benediction on him
dame honeyball and the parish club of crooked lane not forgetting my
shabby but sententious friend in the oil-cloth hat and copper nose

thus have i given a tedious brief account of this interesting
research for which if it prove too short and unsatisfactory i can
only plead my inexperience in this branch of literature so deservedly
popular at the present day i am aware that a more skilful illustrator
of the immortal bard would have swelled the materials i have touched
upon to a good merchantable bulk comprising the biographies of william
walworth jack straw and robert preston some notice of the eminent
fishmongers of st michael's the history of eastcheap great and
little private anecdotes of dame honeyball and her pretty daughter
whom i have not even mentioned to say nothing of a damsel tending the
breast of lamb and whom by the way i remarked to be a comely lass
with a neat foot and ankle the whole enlivened by the riots of wat
tyler and illuminated by the great fire of london

all this i leave as a rich mine to be worked by future commentators
nor do i despair of seeing the tobacco-box and the parcel-gilt goblet
which i have thus brought to light the subject of future engravings
and almost as fruitful of voluminous dissertations and disputes as the
shield of achilles or the far-famed portland vase




the mutability of literature

a colloquy in westminster abbey

 i know that all beneath the moon decays
 and what by mortals in this world is brought
 in time's great periods shall return to nought
 i know that all the muses heavenly rays
 with toil of sprite which are so dearly bought
 as idle sounds of few or none are sought 
 that there is nothing lighter than mere praise
 drummond of hawthornden

there are certain half-dreaming moods of mind in which we naturally
steal away from noise and glare and seek some quiet haunt where we may
indulge our reveries and build our air castles undisturbed in such a
mood i was loitering about the old gray cloisters of westminster abbey
enjoying that luxury of wandering thought which one is apt to dignify
with the name of reflection when suddenly an irruption of madcap boys
from westminster school playing at football broke in upon the monastic
stillness of the place making the vaulted passages and mouldering tombs
echo with their merriment i sought to take refuge from their noise by
penetrating still deeper into the solitudes of the pile and applied to
one of the vergers for admission to the library he conducted me through
a portal rich with the crumbling sculpture of former ages which opened
upon a gloomy passage leading to the chapter-house and the chamber in
which doomsday book is deposited just within the passage is a small
door on the left to this the verger applied a key it was double
locked and opened with some difficulty as if seldom used we now
ascended a dark narrow staircase and passing through a second door
entered the library

i found myself in a lofty antique hall the roof supported by massive
joists of old english oak it was soberly lighted by a row of gothic
windows at a considerable height from the floor and which apparently
opened upon the roofs of the cloisters an ancient picture of some
reverend dignitary of the church in his robes hung over the fireplace
around the hall and in a small gallery were the books arranged in
carved oaken cases they consisted principally of old polemical writers
and were much more worn by time than use in the centre of the library
was a solitary table with two or three books on it an inkstand without
ink and a few pens parched by long disuse the place seemed fitted
for quiet study and profound meditation it was buried deep among the
massive walls of the abbey and shut up from the tumult of the world
i could only hear now and then the shouts of the school-boys faintly
swelling from the cloisters and the sound of a bell tolling for prayers
echoing soberly along the roofs of the abbey by degrees the shouts of
merriment grew fainter and fainter and at length died away the bell
ceased to toll and a profound silence reigned through the dusky hall

i had taken down a little thick quarto curiously bound in parchment
with brass clasps and seated myself at the table in a venerable
elbow-chair instead of reading however i was beguiled by the solemn
monastic air and lifeless quiet of the place into a train of musing
as i looked around upon the old volumes in their mouldering covers thus
ranged on the shelves and apparently never disturbed in their repose
i could not but consider the library a kind of literary catacomb where
authors like mummies are piously entombed and left to blacken and
moulder in dusty oblivion

how much thought i has each of these volumes now thrust aside with
such indifference cost some aching head how many weary days how
many sleepless nights how have their authors buried themselves in the
solitude of cells and cloisters shut themselves up from the face of
man and the still more blessed face of nature and devoted themselves
to painful research and intense reflection and all for what to occupy
an inch of dusty shelf to have the titles of their works read now and
then in a future age by some drowsy churchman or casual straggler like
myself and in another age to be lost even to remembrance such is the
amount of this boasted immortality a mere temporary rumor a local
sound like the tone of that bell which has tolled among these towers
filling the ear for a moment lingering transiently in echo and then
passing away like a thing that was not

while i sat half-murmuring half-meditating these unprofitable
speculations with my head resting on my hand i was thrumming with the
other hand upon the quarto until i accidentally loosened the clasps
when to my utter astonishment the little book gave two or three yawns
like one awaking from a deep sleep then a husky hem and at length
began to talk at first its voice was very hoarse and broken being much
troubled by a cobweb which some studious spider had woven across it and
having probably contracted a cold from long exposure to the chills and
damps of the abbey in a short time however it became more distinct
and i soon found it an exceedingly fluent conversable little tome
its language to be sure was rather quaint and obsolete and its
pronunciation what in the present day would be deemed barbarous but i
shall endeavor as far as i am able to render it in modern parlance

it began with railings about the neglect of the world about merit being
suffered to languish in obscurity and other such commonplace topics of
literary repining and complained bitterly that it had not been opened
for more than two centuries that the dean only looked now and then into
the library sometimes took down a volume or two trifled with them for
a few moments and then returned them to their shelves what a plague
do they mean said the little quarto which i began to perceive was
somewhat choleric what a plague do they mean by keeping several
thousand volumes of us shut up here and watched by a set of old
vergers like so many beauties in a harem merely to be looked at now
and then by the dean books were written to give pleasure and to be
enjoyed and i would have a rule passed that the dean should pay each of
us a visit at least once a year or if he is not equal to the task let
them once in a while turn loose the whole school of westminster among
us that at any rate we may now and then have an airing

softly my worthy friend replied i you are not aware how much
better you are off than most books of your generation by being stored
away in this ancient library you are like the treasured remains of those
saints and monarchs which lie enshrined in the adjoining chapels while
the remains of their contemporary mortals left to the ordinary course
of nature have long since returned to dust

sir said the little tome ruffling his leaves and looking big i
was written for all the world not for the bookworms of an abbey i was
intended to circulate from hand to hand like other great contemporary
works but here have i been clasped up for more than two centuries and
might have silently fallen a prey to these worms that are playing the
very vengeance with my intestines if you had not by chance given me an
opportunity of uttering a few last words before i go to pieces

my good friend rejoined i had you been left to the circulation of
which you speak you would long ere this have been no more to judge
from your physiognomy you are now well stricken in years very few of
your contemporaries can be at present in existence and those few owe
their longevity to being immured like yourself in old libraries which
suffer me to add instead of likening to harems you might more properly
and gratefully have compared to those infirmaries attached to religious
establishments for the benefit of the old and decrepit and where by
quiet fostering and no employment they often endure to an amazingly
good-for-nothing old age you talk of your contemporaries as if in
circulation where do we meet with their works what do we hear of
robert grosteste of lincoln no one could have toiled harder than he for
immortality he is said to have written nearly two hundred volumes he
built as it were a pyramid of books to perpetuate his name but
alas the pyramid has long since fallen and only a few fragments are
scattered in various libraries where they are scarcely disturbed
even by the antiquarian what do we hear of giraldus cambrensis the
historian antiquary philosopher theologian and poet he declined two
bishoprics that he might shut himself up and write for posterity but
posterity never inquires after his labors what of henry of huntingdon
who besides a learned history of england wrote a treatise on the
contempt of the world which the world has revenged by forgetting him
what is quoted of joseph of exeter styled the miracle of his age in
classical composition of his three great heroic poems one is lost
forever excepting a mere fragment the others are known only to a few
of the curious in literature and as to his love verses and epigrams
they have entirely disappeared what is in current use of john wallis
the franciscan who acquired the name of the tree of life of william
of malmsbury of simeon of durham of benedict of peterborough of john
hanvill of st albans of 

prithee friend cried the quarto in a testy tone how old do you
think me you are talking of authors that lived long before my time and
wrote either in latin or french so that they in a manner expatriated
themselves and deserved to be forgotten but i sir was ushered into
the world from the press of the renowned wynkyn de worde i was written
in my own native tongue at a time when the language had become fixed
and indeed i was considered a model of pure and elegant english

i should observe that these remarks were couched in such intolerably
antiquated terms that i have had infinite difficulty in rendering them
into modern phraseology

i cry you mercy said i for mistaking your age but it matters
little almost all the writers of your time have likewise passed into
forgetfulness and de worde's publications are mere literary rarities
among book-collectors the purity and stability of language too on
which you found your claims to perpetuity have been the fallacious
dependence of authors of every age even back to the times of the worthy
robert of gloucester who wrote his history in rhymes of mongrel saxon
even now many talk of spenser's well of pure english undefiled as
if the language ever sprang from a well or fountain-head and was not
rather a mere confluence of various tongues perpetually subject to
changes and intermixtures it is this which has made english literature
so extremely mutable and the reputation built upon it so fleeting
unless thought can be committed to something more permanent and
unchangeable than such a medium even thought must share the fate of
everything else and fall into decay this should serve as a check
upon the vanity and exultation of the most popular writer he finds
the language in which he has embarked his fame gradually altering and
subject to the dilapidations of time and the caprice of fashion he
looks back and beholds the early authors of his country once the
favorites of their day supplanted by modern writers a few short ages
have covered them with obscurity and their merits can only be relished
by the quaint taste of the bookworm and such he anticipates will be
the fate of his own work which however it may be admired in its day
and held up as a model of purity will in the course of years grow
antiquated and obsolete until it shall become almost as unintelligible
in its native land as an egyptian obelisk or one of those runic
inscriptions said to exist in the deserts of tartary i declare added
i with some emotion when i contemplate a modern library filled
with new works in all the bravery of rich gilding and binding i feel
disposed to sit down and weep like the good xerxes when he surveyed
his army pranked out in all the splendor of military array and
reflected that in one hundred years not one of them would be in
existence


 in latin and french hath many soueraine wittes had great
 delyte to endite and have many noble thinges fulfilde but
 certes there ben some that speaken their poisye in french
 of which speche the frenchmen have as good a fantasye as w
 ave in hearying of frenchmen's englishe chaucer's
 testament of love

 holinshed in his chronicle observes afterwards also
 by diligent vell f geffry chaucer and john gowre in the
 time of richard the second and after them of john scogan
 and john lydgate monke of berrie our said toong was
 brought to an excellent passe notwithstanding that it never
 came unto the type of perfection until the time of queen
 elizabeth wherein john jewell bishop of sarum john fox
 and sundrie learned and excellent writers have fully
 accomplished the ornature of the same to their great praise
 and mortal commendation


ah said the little quarto with a heavy sigh i see how it is these
in modern scribblers have superseded all the good old authors i suppose
nothing is read nowadays but sir philip sidney's arcadia sackville's
stately plays and mirror for magistrates or the fine-spun euphuisms of
the unparalleled john lyly

there you are again mistaken said i the writers whom you suppose in
vogue because they happened to be so when you were last in circulation
have long since had their day sir philip sidney's arcadia the
immortality of which was so fondly predicted by his admirers and
which in truth was full of noble thoughts delicate images and
graceful turns of language is now scarcely ever mentioned sackville
has strutted into obscurity and even lyly though his writings were
once the delight of a court and apparently perpetuated by a proverb is
now scarcely known even by name a whole crowd of authors who wrote and
wrangled at the time have likewise gone down with all their writings
and their controversies wave after wave of succeeding literature has
rolled over them until they are buried so deep that it is only now and
then that some industrious diver after fragments of antiquity brings up
a specimen for the gratification of the curious


 live ever sweete booke the simple image of his gentle
 witt and the golden pillar of his noble courage and ever
 notify unto the world that thy writer was the secretary of
 eloquence the breath of the muses the honey bee of the
 daintyest flowers of witt and arte the pith of morale and
 intellectual virtues the arme of bellona in the field the
 tongue of suada in the chamber the spirits of practise in
 esse and the paragon of excellence in print harvey
 pierce's supererogation


for my part i continued i consider this mutability of language a
wise precaution of providence for the benefit of the world at large and
of authors in particular to reason from analogy we daily behold the
varied and beautiful tribes of vegetables springing up flourishing
adorning the fields for a short time and then fading into dust to
make way for their successors were not this the case the fecundity of
nature would be a grievance instead of a blessing the earth would groan
with rank and excessive vegetation and its surface become a tangled
wilderness in like manner the works of genius and learning decline and
make way for subsequent productions language gradually varies and with
it fade away the writings of authors who have flourished their allotted
time otherwise the creative powers of genius would overstock the world
and the mind would be completely bewildered in the endless mazes of
literature formerly there were some restraints on this excessive
multiplication works had to be transcribed by hand which was a slow
and laborious operation they were written either on parchment which
was expensive so that one work was often erased to make way for
another or on papyrus which was fragile and extremely perishable
authorship was a limited and unprofitable craft pursued chiefly by
monks in the leisure and solitude of their cloisters the accumulation
of manuscripts was slow and costly and confined almost entirely to
monasteries to these circumstances it may in some measure be owing
that we have not been inundated by the intellect of antiquity that the
fountains of thought have not been broken up and modern genius drowned
in the deluge but the inventions of paper and the press have put an end
to all these restraints they have made every one a writer and enabled
every mind to pour itself into print and diffuse itself over the
whole intellectual world the consequences are alarming the stream of
literature has swollen into a torrent augmented into a river-expanded
into a sea a few centuries since five or six hundred manuscripts
constituted a great library but what would you say to libraries such
as actually exist containing three or four hundred thousand volumes
legions of authors at the same time busy and the press going on with
fearfully increasing activity to double and quadruple the number
unless some unforeseen mortality should break out among the progeny of
the muse now that she has become so prolific i tremble for posterity
i fear the mere fluctuation of language will not be sufficient
criticism may do much it increases with the increase of literature
and resembles one of those salutary checks on population spoken of by
economists all possible encouragement therefore should be given to
the growth of critics good or bad but i fear all will be in vain let
criticism do what it may writers will write printers will print and
the world will inevitably be overstocked with good books it will soon
be the employment of a lifetime merely to learn their names many a man
of passable information at the present day reads scarcely anything but
reviews and before long a man of erudition will be little better than a
mere walking catalogue

my very good sir said the little quarto yawning most drearily in my
face excuse my interrupting you but i perceive you are rather given
to prose i would ask the fate of an author who was making some noise
just as i left the world his reputation however was considered quite
temporary the learned shook their heads at him for he was a poor
half-educated varlet that knew little of latin and nothing of greek
and had been obliged to run the country for deer-stealing i think his
name was shakespeare i presume he soon sunk into oblivion

on the contrary said i it is owing to that very man that the
literature of his period has experienced a duration beyond the ordinary
term of english literature there rise authors now and then who seem
proof against the mutability of language because they have rooted
themselves in the unchanging principles of human nature they are like
gigantic trees that we sometimes see on the banks of a stream which
by their vast and deep roots penetrating through the mere surface and
laying hold on the very foundations of the earth preserve the soil
around them from being swept away by the ever-flowing current and hold
up many a neighboring plant and perhaps worthless weed to perpetuity
such is the case with shakespeare whom we behold defying the
encroachments of time retaining in modern use the language and
literature of his day and giving duration to many an indifferent
author merely from having flourished in his vicinity but even he i
grieve to say is gradually assuming the tint of age and his whole form
is overrun by a profusion of commentators who like clambering vines
and creepers almost bury the noble plant that upholds them

here the little quarto began to heave his sides and chuckle until at
length he broke out into a plethoric fit of laughter that had wellnigh
choked him by reason of his excessive corpulency mighty well cried
he as soon as he could recover breath mighty well and so you would
persuade me that the literature of an age is to be perpetuated by a
vagabond deer-stealer by a man without learning by a poet forsooth a
poet and here he wheezed forth another fit of laughter

i confess that i felt somewhat nettled at this rudeness which however
i pardoned on account of his having flourished in a less polished age i
determined nevertheless not to give up my point

yes resumed i positively a poet for of all writers he has the best
chance for immortality others may write from the head but he writes
from the heart and the heart will always understand him he is the
faithful portrayer of nature whose features are always the same and
always interesting prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy their
pages crowded with commonplaces and their thoughts expanded into
tediousness but with the true poet every thing is terse touching or
brilliant he gives the choicest thoughts in the choicest language he
illustrates them by everything that he sees most striking in nature and
art he enriches them by pictures of human life such as it is passing
before him his writings therefore contain the spirit the aroma if i
may use the phrase of the age in which he lives they are caskets which
inclose within a small compass the wealth of the language its family
jewels which are thus transmitted in a portable form to posterity the
setting may occasionally be antiquated and require now and then to be
renewed as in the case of chaucer but the brilliancy and intrinsic
value of the gems continue unaltered cast a look back over the long
reach of literary history what vast valleys of dulness filled with
monkish legends and academical controversies what bogs of theological
speculations what dreary wastes of metaphysics here and there only
do we behold the heaven-illumined bards elevated like beacons on
their widely-separated heights to transmit the pure light of poetical
intelligence from age to age

i was just about to launch forth into eulogiums upon the poets of the
day when the sudden opening of the door caused me to turn my head it
was the verger who came to inform me that it was time to close the
library i sought to have a parting word with the quarto but the worthy
little tome was silent the clasps were closed and it looked perfectly
unconscious of all that had passed i have been to the library two
or three times since and have endeavored to draw it into further
conversation but in vain and whether all this rambling colloquy
actually took place or whether it was another of those old day-dreams
to which i am subject i have never to this moment been able to
discover

rural funerals

 here's a few flowers but about midnight more

 the herbs that have oil them cold dew o the night
 are strewings fitt'st for graves 
 you were as flowers now withered even so
 these herblets shall which we upon you strow
 cymbeline

among the beautiful and simple-hearted customs of rural life which still
linger in some parts of england are those of strewing flowers before the
funerals and planting them at the graves of departed friends these it
is said are the remains of some of the rites of the primitive church
but they are of still higher antiquity having been observed among the
greeks and romans and frequently mentioned by their writers and were
no doubt the spontaneous tributes of unlettered affection originating
long before art had tasked itself to modulate sorrow into song or story
it on the monument they are now only to be met with in the most distant
and retired places of the kingdom where fashion and innovation have not
been able to throng in and trample out all the curious and interesting
traces of the olden time

in glamorganshire we are told the bed whereon the corpse lies is
covered with flowers a custom alluded to in one of the wild and
plaintive ditties of ophelia

 white his shroud as the mountain snow

 larded all with sweet flowers
 which be-wept to the grave did go
 with true love showers

there is also a most delicate and beautiful rite observed in some of
the remote villages of the south at the funeral of a female who has
died young and unmarried a chaplet of white flowers is borne before
the corpse by a young girl nearest in age size and resemblance and
is afterwards hung up in the church over the accustomed seat of the
deceased these chaplets are sometimes made of white paper in imitation
of flowers and inside of them is generally a pair of white gloves they
are intended as emblems of the purity of the deceased and the crown of
glory which she has received in heaven

in some parts of the country also the dead are carried to the grave
with the singing of psalms and hymns a kind of triumph to show says
bourne that they have finished their course with joy and are become
conquerors this i am informed is observed in some of the northern
counties particularly in northumberland and it has a pleasing though
melancholy effect to hear of a still evening in some lonely country
scene the mournful melody of a funeral dirge swelling from a distance
and to see the train slowly moving along the landscape

 thus thus and thus we compass round
 thy harmless and unhaunted ground
 and as we sing thy dirge we will
 the daffodill
 and other flowers lay upon
 the altar of our love thy stone
 herrick

there is also a solemn respect paid by the traveller to the passing
funeral in these sequestered places for such spectacles occurring
among the quiet abodes of nature sink deep into the soul as the
mourning train approaches he pauses uncovered to let it go by he then
follows silently in the rear sometimes quite to the grave at other
times for a few hundred yards and having paid this tribute of respect
to the deceased turns and resumes his journey

the rich vein of melancholy which runs through the english character
and gives it some of its most touching and ennobling graces is finely
evidenced in these pathetic customs and in the solicitude shown by the
common people for an honored and a peaceful grave the humblest peasant
whatever may be his lowly lot while living is anxious that some little
respect may be paid to his remains sir thomas overbury describing the
faire and happy milkmaid observes thus lives she and all her care
is that she may die in the spring-time to have store of flowers stucke
upon her winding-sheet the poets too who always breathe the feeling
of a nation continually advert to this fond solicitude about the grave
in the maid's tragedy by beaumont and fletcher there is a beautiful
instance of the kind describing the capricious melancholy of a
broken-hearted girl

 when she sees a bank
 stuck full of flowers she with a sigh will tell
 her servants what a pretty place it were
 to bury lovers in and made her maids
 bluck em and strew her over like a corse

the custom of decorating graves was once universally prevalent osiers
were carefully bent over them to keep the turf uninjured and about
them were planted evergreens and flowers we adorn their graves says
evelyn in his sylva with flowers and redolent plants just emblems
of the life of man which has been compared in holy scriptures to those
fading beauties whose roots being buried in dishonor rise again in
glory this usage has now become extremely rare in england but it
may still be met with in the churchyards of retired villages among the
welsh mountains and i recollect an instance of it at the small town of
ruthven which lies at the head of the beautiful vale of clewyd i have
been told also by a friend who was present at the funeral of a young
girl in glamorganshire that the female attendants had their aprons full
of flowers which as soon as the body was interred they stuck about
the grave

he noticed several graves which had been decorated in the same manner
as the flowers had been merely stuck in the ground and not planted
they had soon withered and might be seen in various states of decay
some drooping others quite perished they were afterwards to be
supplanted by holly rosemary and other evergreens which on some
graves had grown to great luxuriance and overshadowed the tombstones

there was formerly a melancholy fancifulness in the arrangement of these
rustic offerings that had something in it truly poetical the rose
was sometimes blended with the lily to form a general emblem of frail
mortality this sweet flower said evelyn borne on a branch set with
thorns and accompanied with the lily are natural hieroglyphics of our
fugitive umbratile anxious and transitory life which making so
fair a show for a time is not yet without its thorns and crosses the
nature and color of the flowers and of the ribbons with which they were
tied had often a particular reference to the qualities or story of the
deceased or were expressive of the feelings of the mourner in an
old poem entitled corydon's doleful knell a lover specifies the
decorations he intends to use

 a garland shall be framed
 by art and nature's skill
 of sundry-colored flowers
 in token of good-will

 and sundry-colored ribbons
 on it i will bestow
 but chiefly blacke and yellowe
 with her to grave shall go

 i'll deck her tomb with flowers
 the rarest ever seen
 and with my tears as showers
 i'll keep them fresh and green

the white rose we are told was planted at the grave of a virgin her
chaplet was tied with white ribbons in token of her spotless innocence
though sometimes black ribbons were intermingled to bespeak the grief
of the survivors the red rose was occasionally used in remembrance of
such as had been remarkable for benevolence but roses in general were
appropriated to the graves of lovers evelyn tells us that the custom
was not altogether extinct in his time near his dwelling in the county
of surrey where the maidens yearly planted and decked the graves
of their defunct sweethearts with rose-bushes and camden likewise
remarks in his britannia here is also a certain custom observed time
out of mind of planting rose-trees upon the graves especially by the
young men and maids who have lost their loves so that this churchyard
is now full of them

when the deceased had been unhappy in their loves emblems of a more
gloomy character were used such as the yew and cypress and if flowers
were strewn they were of the most melancholy colors thus in poems by
thomas stanley esq published in is the following stanza

 yet strew
 upon my dismall grave
 such offerings as you have
 forsaken cypresse and yewe
 for kinder flowers can take no birth
 or growth from such unhappy earth

in the maid's tragedy a pathetic little air is introduced
illustrative of this mode of decorating the funerals of females who had
been disappointed in love

 lay a garland on my hearse
 of the dismall yew
 maidens willow branches wear
 say i died true

 my love was false but i was firm
 from my hour of birth
 upon my buried body lie
 lightly gentle earth

the natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate
the mind and we have a proof of it in the purity of sentiment and the
unaffected elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these
funeral observances thus it was an especial precaution that none but
sweet-scented evergreens and flowers should be employed the intention
seems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb to beguile the
mind from brooding over the disgraces of perishing mortality and
to associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and
beautiful objects in nature there is a dismal process going on in the
grave ere dust can return to its kindred dust which the imagination
shrinks from contemplating and we seek still to think of the form
we have loved with those refined associations which it awakened when
blooming before us in youth and beauty lay her i the earth says
laertes of his virgin sister

 and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
 may violets spring

herrick also in his dirge of jephtha pours forth a fragrant flow
of poetical thought and image which in a manner embalms the dead in the
recollections of the living

 sleep in thy peace thy bed of spice
 and make this place all paradise
 may sweets grow here and smoke from hence
 fat frankincense

 let balme and cassia send their scent
 from out thy maiden monument
 
 may all shie maids at wonted hours
 come forth to strew thy tombe with flowers
 may virgins when they come to mourn
 male incense burn
 upon thine altar then return
 and leave thee sleeping in thy urn

i might crowd my pages with extracts from the older british poets who
wrote when these rites were more prevalent and delighted frequently
to allude to them but i have already quoted more than is necessary i
cannot however refrain from giving a passage from shakespeare even
though it should appear trite which illustrates the emblematical
meaning often conveyed in these floral tributes and at the same time
possesses that magic of language and appositeness of imagery for which
he stands pre-eminent

 with fairest flowers
 whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
 i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
 the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
 the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
 the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
 outsweetened not thy breath

there is certainly something more affecting in these prompt and
spontaneous offerings of nature than in the most costly monuments of
art the hand strews the flower while the heart is warm and the tear
falls on the grave as affection is binding the osier round the sod but
pathos expires under the slow labor of the chisel and is chilled among
the cold conceits of sculptured marble

it is greatly to be regretted that a custom so truly elegant and
touching has disappeared from general use and exists only in the most
remote and insignificant villages but it seems as if poetical custom
always shuns the walks of cultivated society in proportion as people
grow polite they cease to be poetical they talk of poetry but they
have learnt to check its free impulses to distrust its sallying
emotions and to supply its most affecting and picturesque usages by
studied form and pompous ceremonial few pageants can be more stately
and frigid than an english funeral in town it is made up of show and
gloomy parade mourning carriages mourning horses mourning plumes
and hireling mourners who make a mockery of grief there is a grave
digged says jeremy taylor and a solemn mourning and a great talk
in the neighborhood and when the daies are finished they shall be and
they shall be remembered no more the associate in the gay and crowded
city is soon forgotten the hurrying succession of new intimates and new
pleasures effaces him from our minds and the very scenes and circles in
which he moved are incessantly fluctuating but funerals in the country
are solemnly impressive the stroke of death makes a wider space in
the village circle and is an awful event in the tranquil uniformity
of rural life the passing bell tolls its knell in every ear it steals
with its pervading melancholy over hill and vale and saddens all the
landscape

the fixed and unchanging features of the country also perpetuate
the memory of the friend with whom we once enjoyed them who was the
companion of our most retired walks and gave animation to every lonely
scene his idea is associated with every charm of nature we hear his
voice in the echo which he once delighted to awaken his spirit haunts
the grove which he once frequented we think of him in the wild upland
solitude or amidst the pensive beauty of the valley in the freshness of
joyous morning we remember his beaming smiles and bounding gayety
and when sober evening returns with its gathering shadows and subduing
quiet we call to mind many a twilight hour of gentle talk and
sweet-souled melancholy

 each lonely place shall him restore
 for him the tear be duly shed
 beloved till life can charm no more
 and mourn'd till pity's self be dead

another cause that perpetuates the memory of the deceased in the country
is that the grave is more immediately in sight of the survivors they
pass it on their way to prayer it meets their eyes when their hearts
are softened by the exercises of devotion they linger about it on
the sabbath when the mind is disengaged from worldly cares and most
disposed to turn aside from present pleasures and present loves and
to sit down among the solemn mementos of the past in north wales the
peasantry kneel and pray over the graves of their deceased friends
for several sundays after the interment and where the tender rite of
strewing and planting flowers is still practised it is always renewed
on easter whitsuntide and other festivals when the season brings
the companion of former festivity more vividly to mind it is also
invariably performed by the nearest relatives and friends no menials
nor hirelings are employed and if a neighbor yields assistance it
would be deemed an insult to offer compensation

i have dwelt upon this beautiful rural custom because as it is one of
the last so is it one of the holiest offices of love the grave is
the ordeal of true affection it is there that the divine passion of the
soul manifests its superiority to the instinctive impulse of mere animal
attachment the latter must be continually refreshed and kept alive by
the presence of its object but the love that is seated in the soul can
live on long remembrance the mere inclinations of sense languish and
decline with the charms which excited them and turn with shuddering
disgust from the dismal precincts of the tomb but it is thence that
truly spiritual affection rises purified from every sensual desire and
returns like a holy flame to illumine and sanctify the heart of the
survivor

the sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be
divorced every other wound we seek to heal every other affliction
to forget but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open this
affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude where is the mother
who would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from
her arms though every recollection is a pang where is the child that
would willingly forget the most tender of parents though to remember be
but to lament who even in the hour of agony would forget the friend
over whom he mourns who even when the tomb is closing upon the remains
of her he most loved when he feels his heart as it were crushed in
the closing of its portal would accept of consolation that must be
bought by forgetfulness no the love which survives the tomb is one of
the noblest attributes of the soul if it has its woes it has likewise
its delights and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed
into the gentle tear of recollection when the sudden anguish and the
convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved is
softened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of
its loveliness who would root out such a sorrow from the heart though
it may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety
or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom yet who would
exchange it even for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry no
there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song there is a remembrance
of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living oh
the grave the grave it buries every error covers every defect
extinguishes every resentment from its peaceful bosom spring none but
fond regrets and tender recollections who can look down upon the grave
even of an enemy and not feel a compunctious throb that he should ever
have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies mouldering before
him

but the grave of those we loved what a place for meditation there
it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue
and gentleness and the thousand endearments lavished upon us almost
unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy there it is that we dwell
upon the tenderness the solemn awful tenderness of the parting
scene the bed of death with all its stifled griefs its noiseless
attendance its mute watchful assiduities the last testimonies
of expiring love the feeble fluttering thrilling oh how
thrilling pressure of the hand the faint faltering accents
struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection the last
fond look of the glazing eye turning upon us even from the threshold of
existence

ay go to the grave of buried love and meditate there settle the
account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited every
past endearment unregarded of that departed being who can
never-never never return to be soothed by thy contrition

if thou art a child and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul or a
furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent if thou art a
husband and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole
happiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth
if thou art a friend and hast ever wronged in thought or word or deed
the spirit that generously confided in thee if thou art a lover and
hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart which now lies
cold and still beneath thy feet then be sure that every unkind look
every ungracious word every ungentle action will come thronging back
upon thy memory and knocking dolefully at thy soul then be sure that
thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave and utter
the unheard groan and pour the unavailing tear more deep more bitter
because unheard and unavailing

then weave thy chaplet of flowers and strew the beauties of nature about
the grave console thy broken spirit if thou canst with these tender
yet futile tributes of regret but take warning by the bitterness of
this thy contrite affliction over the dead and henceforth be more
faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living

 

in writing the preceding article it was not intended to give a full
detail of the funeral customs of the english peasantry but merely to
furnish a few hints and quotations illustrative of particular rites to
be appended by way of note to another paper which has been withheld
the article swelled insensibly into its present form and this is
mentioned as an apology for so brief and casual a notice of these usages
after they have been amply and learnedly investigated in other works

i must observe also that i am well aware that this custom of adorning
graves with flowers prevails in other countries besides england indeed
in some it is much more general and is observed even by the rich and
fashionable but it is then apt to lose its simplicity and to degenerate
into affectation bright in his travels in lower hungary tells of
monuments of marble and recesses formed for retirement with seats
placed among bowers of greenhouse plants and that the graves generally
are covered with the gayest flowers of the season he gives a casual
picture of filial piety which i cannot but transcribe for i trust it is
as useful as it is delightful to illustrate the amiable virtues of the
sex when i was at berlin says he i followed the celebrated iffland
to the grave mingled with some pomp you might trace much real feeling
in the midst of the ceremony my attention was attracted by a young
woman who stood on a mound of earth newly covered with turf which she
anxiously protected from the feet of the passing crowd it was the tomb
of her parent and the figure of this affectionate daughter presented a
monument more striking than the most costly work of art

i will barely add an instance of sepulchral decoration that i once
met with among the mountains of switzerland it was at the village of
gersau which stands on the borders of the lake of lucerne at the foot
of mount rigi it was once the capital of a miniature republic shut up
between the alps and the lake and accessible on the land side only by
footpaths the whole force of the republic did not exceed six hundred
fighting men and a few miles of circumference scooped out as it were
from the bosom of the mountains comprised its territory the village
of gersau seemed separated from the rest of the world and retained
the golden simplicity of a purer age it had a small church with a
burying-ground adjoining at the heads of the graves were placed crosses
of wood or iron on some were affixed miniatures rudely executed but
evidently attempts at likenesses of the deceased on the crosses
were hung chaplets of flowers some withering others fresh as if
occasionally renewed i paused with interest at this scene i felt
that i was at the source of poetical description for these were the
beautiful but unaffected offerings of the heart which poets are fain to
record in a gayer and more populous place i should have suspected them
to have been suggested by factitious sentiment derived from books but
the good people of gersau knew little of books there was not a novel
nor a love-poem in the village and i question whether any peasant of
the place dreamt while he was twining a fresh chaplet for the grave of
his mistress that he was fulfilling one of the most fanciful rites of
poetical devotion and that he was practically a poet




the inn kitchen

 shall i not take mine ease in mine inn
 falstaff

during a journey that i once made through the netherlands i had arrived
one evening at the pomme d'or the principal inn of a small flemish
village it was after the hour of the table d'hote so that i was
obliged to make a solitary supper from the relics of its ampler board
the weather was chilly i was seated alone in one end of a great gloomy
dining-room and my repast being over i had the prospect before me
of a long dull evening without any visible means of enlivening it i
summoned mine host and requested something to read he brought me the
whole literary stock of his household a dutch family bible an almanac
in the same language and a number of old paris newspapers as i sat
dozing over one of the latter reading old news and stale criticisms
my ear was now and then struck with bursts of laughter which seemed to
proceed from the kitchen every one that has travelled on the continent
must know how favorite a resort the kitchen of a country inn is to the
middle and inferior order of travellers particularly in that equivocal
kind of weather when a fire becomes agreeable toward evening i threw
aside the newspaper and explored my way to the kitchen to take a peep
at the group that appeared to be so merry it was composed partly of
travellers who had arrived some hours before in a diligence and partly
of the usual attendants and hangers-on of inns they were seated round
a great burnished stove that might have been mistaken for an altar at
which they were worshipping it was covered with various kitchen vessels
of resplendent brightness among which steamed and hissed a huge copper
tea-kettle a large lamp threw a strong mass of light upon the group
bringing out many odd features in strong relief its yellow rays
partially illumined the spacious kitchen dying duskily away into remote
corners except where they settled in mellow radiance on the broad side
of a flitch of bacon or were reflected back from well-scoured utensils
that gleamed from the midst of obscurity a strapping flemish lass
with long golden pendants in her ears and a necklace with a golden heart
suspended to it was the presiding priestess of the temple

many of the company were furnished with pipes and most of them with
some kind of evening potation i found their mirth was occasioned by
anecdotes which a little swarthy frenchman with a dry weazen face and
large whiskers was giving of his love-adventures at the end of each of
which there was one of those bursts of honest unceremonious laughter in
which a man indulges in that temple of true liberty an inn

as i had no better mode of getting through a tedious blustering evening
i took my seat near the stove and listened to a variety of travellers
tales some very extravagant and most very dull all of them however
have faded from my treacherous memory except one which i will endeavor
to relate i fear however it derived its chief zest from the manner in
which it was told and the peculiar air and appearance of the narrator
he was a corpulent old swiss who had the look of a veteran traveller
he was dressed in a tarnished green travelling-jacket with a broad belt
round his waist and a pair of overalls with buttons from the hips to
the ankles he was of a full rubicund countenance with a double chin
aquiline nose and a pleasant twinkling eye his hair was light and
curled from under an old green velvet travelling-cap stuck on one side
of his head he was interrupted more than once by the arrival of guests
or the remarks of his auditors and paused now and then to replenish his
pipe at which times he had generally a roguish leer and a sly joke for
the buxom kitchen-maid

i wish my readers could imagine the old fellow lolling in a huge
arm-chair one arm a-kimbo the other holding a curiously twisted
tobacco-pipe formed of genuine ecume de mer decorated with silver chain
and silken tassel his head cocked on one side and a whimsical cut of
the eye occasionally as he related the following story




the spectre bridegroom

a traveller's tale

 he that supper for is dight
 he lyes full cold i trow this night
 yestreen to chamber i him led
 this night gray-steel has made his bed
 sir eger sir grahame and sir gray-steel

on the summit of one of the heights of the odenwald a wild and romantic
tract of upper germany that lies not far from the confluence of the
main and the rhine there stood many many years since the castle of the
baron von landshort it is now quite fallen to decay and almost
buried among beech trees and dark firs above which however its old
watch-tower may still be seen struggling like the former possessor i
have mentioned to carry a high head and look down upon the neighboring
country

the baron was a dry branch of the great family of katzenellenbogen
and inherited the relics of the property and all the pride of his
ancestors though the warlike disposition of his predecessors had much
impaired the family possessions yet the baron still endeavored to keep
up some show of former state the times were peaceable and the german
nobles in general had abandoned their inconvenient old castles perched
like eagles nests among the mountains and had built more convenient
residences in the valleys still the baron remained proudly drawn up in
his little fortress cherishing with hereditary inveteracy all the
old family feuds so that he was on ill terms with some of his nearest
neighbors on account of disputes that had happened between their
great-great-grandfathers


 the erudite reader well versed in good-for-nothing lore
 will perceive that the above tale must have been suggested
 to the old swiss by a little french anecdote a circumstance
 said to have taken place in paris

 ie cat's elbow the name of a family of those parts
 and very powerful in former times the appellation we are
 told was given in compliment to a peerless dame of the
 family celebrated for a fine arm


the baron had but one child a daughter but nature when she grants but
one child always compensates by making it a prodigy and so it was with
the daughter of the baron all the nurses gossips and country cousins
assured her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all germany
and who should know better than they she had moreover been brought up
with great care under the superintendence of two maiden aunts who had
spent some years of their early life at one of the little german courts
and were skilled in all branches of knowledge necessary to the education
of a fine lady under their instructions she became a miracle of
accomplishments by the time she was eighteen she could embroider to
admiration and had worked whole histories of the saints in tapestry
with such strength of expression in their countenances that they
looked like so many souls in purgatory she could read without great
difficulty and had spelled her way through several church legends and
almost all the chivalric wonders of the heldenbuch she had even made
considerable proficiency in writing could sign her own name without
missing a letter and so legibly that her aunts could read it without
spectacles she excelled in making little elegant good-for-nothing
lady-like knicknacks of all kinds was versed in the most abstruse
dancing of the day played a number of airs on the harp and guitar and
knew all the tender ballads of the minnelieders by heart

her aunts too having been great flirts and coquettes in their younger
days were admirably calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict
censors of the conduct of their niece for there is no duenna so rigidly
prudent and inexorably decorous as a superannuated coquette she was
rarely suffered out of their sight never went beyond the domains of
the castle unless well attended or rather well watched had continual
lectures read to her about strict decorum and implicit obedience and
as to the men pah she was taught to hold them at such a distance and
in such absolute distrust that unless properly authorized she would
not have cast a glance upon the handsomest cavalier in the world no
not if he were even dying at her feet

the good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent the young
lady was a pattern of docility and correctness while others were
wasting their sweetness in the glare of the world and liable to be
plucked and thrown aside by every hand she was coyly blooming into
fresh and lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate
spinsters like a rosebud blushing forth among guardian thorns her
aunts looked upon her with pride and exultation and vaunted that
though all the other young ladies in the world might go astray yet
thank heaven nothing of the kind could happen to the heiress of
katzenellenbogen

but however scantily the baron von landshort might be provided with
children his household was by no means a small one for providence
had enriched him with abundance of poor relations they one and all
possessed the affectionate disposition common to humble relatives were
wonderfully attached to the baron and took every possible occasion
to come in swarms and enliven the castle all family festivals were
commemorated by these good people at the baron's expense and when they
were filled with good cheer they would declare that there was nothing
on earth so delightful as these family meetings these jubilees of the
heart

the baron though a small man had a large soul and it swelled with
satisfaction at the consciousness of being the greatest man in the
little world about him he loved to tell long stories about the stark
old warriors whose portraits looked grimly down from the walls around
and he found no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense he
was much given to the marvellous and a firm believer in all those
supernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in germany
abounds the faith of his guests exceeded even his own they listened
to every tale of wonder with open eyes and mouth and never failed to be
astonished even though repeated for the hundredth time thus lived the
baron von landshort the oracle of his table the absolute monarch of
his little territory and happy above all things in the persuasion
that he was the wisest man of the age

at the time of which my story treats there was a great family gathering
at the castle on an affair of the utmost importance it was to receive
the destined bridegroom of the baron's daughter a negotiation had been
carried on between the father and an old nobleman of bavaria to unite
the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children the
preliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio the young people
were betrothed without seeing each other and the time was appointed for
the marriage ceremony the young count von altenburg had been recalled
from the army for the purpose and was actually on his way to the
baron's to receive his bride missives had even been received from him
from wurtzburg where he was accidentally detained mentioning the day
and hour when he might be expected to arrive

the castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a suitable
welcome the fair bride had been decked out with uncommon care the two
aunts had superintended her toilet and quarrelled the whole morning
about every article of her dress the young lady had taken advantage of
their contest to follow the bent of her own taste and fortunately
it was a good one she looked as lovely as youthful bridegroom could
desire and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre of her
charms

the suffusions that mantled her face and neck the gentle heaving of
the bosom the eye now and then lost in reverie all betrayed the soft
tumult that was going on in her little heart the aunts were continually
hovering around her for maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in
affairs of this nature they were giving her a world of staid counsel
how to deport herself what to say and in what manner to receive the
expected lover

the baron was no less busied in preparations he had in truth nothing
exactly to do but he was naturally a fuming bustling little man and
could not remain passive when all the world was in a hurry he worried
from top to bottom of the castle with an air of infinite anxiety he
continually called the servants from their work to exhort them to be
diligent and buzzed about every hall and chamber as idly restless and
importunate as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day

in the mean time the fatted calf had been killed the forests had rung
with the clamor of the huntsmen the kitchen was crowded with good
cheer the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of rhein-wein and
ferre-wein and even the great heidelberg tun had been laid under
contribution everything was ready to receive the distinguished guest
with saus und braus in the true spirit of german hospitality but the
guest delayed to make his appearance hour rolled after hour the sun
that had poured his downward rays upon the rich forest of the odenwald
now just gleamed along the summits of the mountains the baron mounted
the highest tower and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a distant
sight of the count and his attendants once he thought he beheld them
the sound of horns came floating from the valley prolonged by the
mountain-echoes a number of horsemen were seen far below slowly
advancing along the road but when they had nearly reached the foot of
the mountain they suddenly struck off in a different direction the last
ray of sunshine departed the bats began to flit by in the twilight the
road grew dimmer and dimmer to the view and nothing appeared stirring
in it but now and then a peasant lagging homeward from his labor

while the old castle of landshort was in this state of perplexity a very
interesting scene was transacting in a different part of the odenwald

the young count von altenburg was tranquilly pursuing his route in that
sober jog-trot way in which a man travels toward matrimony when his
friends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his
hands and a bride is waiting for him as certainly as a dinner at the
end of his journey he had encountered at wurtzburg a youthful
companion-in-arms with whom he had seen some service on the
frontiers herman von starkenfaust one of the stoutest hands and
worthiest hearts of german chivalry who was now returning from the
army his father's castle was not far distant from the old fortress of
landshort although an hereditary feud rendered the families hostile and
strangers to each other

in the warm-hearted moment of recognition the young friends related all
their past adventures and fortunes and the count gave the whole history
of his intended nuptials with a young lady whom he had never seen but
of whose charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions

as the route of the friends lay in the same direction they agreed to
perform the rest of their journey together and that they might do it
the more leisurely set off from wurtzburg at an early hour the count
having given directions for his retinue to follow and overtake him

they beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their military
scenes and adventures but the count was apt to be a little tedious now
and then about the reputed charms of his bride and the felicity that
awaited him

in this way they had entered among the mountains of the odenwald and
were traversing one of its most lonely and thickly wooded passes it is
well known that the forests of germany have always been as much infested
by robbers as its castles by spectres and at this time the former were
particularly numerous from the hordes of disbanded soldiers wandering
about the country it will not appear extraordinary therefore that the
cavaliers were attacked by a gang of these stragglers in the midst
of the forest they defended themselves with bravery but were nearly
overpowered when the count's retinue arrived to their assistance at
sight of them the robbers fled but not until the count had received a
mortal wound he was slowly and carefully conveyed back to the city
of wurtzburg and a friar summoned from a neighboring convent who was
famous for his skill in administering to both soul and body but half
of his skill was superfluous the moments of the unfortunate count were
numbered

with his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair instantly to the
castle of landshort and explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his
appointment with his bride though not the most ardent of lovers he was
one of the most punctilious of men and appeared earnestly solicitous
that his mission should be speedily and courteously executed unless
this is done said he i shall not sleep quietly in my grave he
repeated these last words with peculiar solemnity a request at a moment
so impressive admitted no hesitation starkenfaust endeavored to soothe
him to calmness promised faithfully to execute his wish and gave him
his hand in solemn pledge the dying man pressed it in acknowledgment
but soon lapsed into delirium raved about his bride his engagements
his plighted word ordered his horse that he might ride to the castle
of landshort and expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the
saddle

starkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier's tear on the untimely
fate of his comrade and then pondered on the awkward mission he had
undertaken his heart was heavy and his head perplexed for he was to
present himself an unbidden guest among hostile people and to damp
their festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes still there were
certain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this far-famed
beauty of katzenellenbogen so cautiously shut up from the world for
he was a passionate admirer of the sex and there was a dash of
eccentricity and enterprise in his character that made him fond of all
singular adventure

previous to his departure he made all due arrangements with the holy
fraternity of the convent for the funeral solemnities of his friend
who was to be buried in the cathedral of wurtzburg near some of his
illustrious relatives and the mourning retinue of the count took charge
of his remains

it is now high time that we should return to the ancient family of
katzenellenbogen who were impatient for their guest and still more
for their dinner and to the worthy little baron whom we left airing
himself on the watch-tower

night closed in but still no guest arrived the baron descended from
the tower in despair the banquet which had been delayed from hour to
hour could no longer be postponed the meats were already overdone the
cook in an agony and the whole household had the look of a garrison
that had been reduced by famine the baron was obliged reluctantly to
give orders for the feast without the presence of the guest all were
seated at table and just on the point of commencing when the sound of
a horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger
another long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes
and was answered by the warder from the walls the baron hastened to
receive his future son-in-law

the drawbridge had been let down and the stranger was before the
gate he was a tall gallant cavalier mounted on a black steed his
countenance was pale but he had a beaming romantic eye and an air of
stately melancholy the baron was a little mortified that he should
have come in this simple solitary style his dignity for a moment was
ruffled and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper respect
for the important occasion and the important family with which he was to
be connected he pacified himself however with the conclusion that it
must have been youthful impatience which had induced him thus to spur on
sooner than his attendants

i am sorry said the stranger to break in upon you thus
unseasonably 

here the baron interrupted him with a world of compliments and
greetings for to tell the truth he prided himself upon his courtesy
and eloquence the stranger attempted once or twice to stem the torrent
of words but in vain so he bowed his head and suffered it to flow on
by the time the baron had come to a pause they had reached the inner
court of the castle and the stranger was again about to speak when he
was once more interrupted by the appearance of the female part of the
family leading forth the shrinking and blushing bride he gazed on her
for a moment as one entranced it seemed as if his whole soul beamed
forth in the gaze and rested upon that lovely form one of the maiden
aunts whispered something in her ear she made an effort to speak her
moist blue eye was timidly raised gave a shy glance of inquiry on the
stranger and was cast again to the ground the words died away but
there was a sweet smile playing about her lips and a soft dimpling of
the cheek that showed her glance had not been unsatisfactory it was
impossible for a girl of the fond age of eighteen highly predisposed
for love and matrimony not to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier

the late hour at which the guest had arrived left no time for parley
the baron was peremptory and deferred all particular conversation until
the morning and led the way to the untasted banquet

it was served up in the great hall of the castle around the walls
hung the hard-favored portraits of the heroes of the house of
katzenellenbogen and the trophies which they had gained in the field
and in the chase hacked corselets splintered jousting-spears and
tattered banners were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare the
jaws of the wolf and the tusks of the boar grinned horribly among
crossbows and battle-axes and a huge pair of antlers branched
immediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom

the cavalier took but little notice of the company or the entertainment
he scarcely tasted the banquet but seemed absorbed in admiration of his
bride he conversed in a low tone that could not be overheard for the
language of love is never loud but where is the female ear so dull that
it cannot catch the softest whisper of the lover there was a mingled
tenderness and gravity in his manner that appeared to have a powerful
effect upon the young lady her color came and went as she listened with
deep attention now and then she made some blushing reply and when his
eye was turned away she would steal a sidelong glance at his romantic
countenance and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness it was evident
that the young couple were completely enamored the aunts who were
deeply versed in the mysteries of the heart declared that they had
fallen in love with each other at first sight

the feast went on merrily or at least noisily for the guests were
all blessed with those keen appetites that attend upon light purses and
mountain air the baron told his best and longest stories and never had
he told them so well or with such great effect if there was anything
marvellous his auditors were lost in astonishment and if anything
facetious they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place the
baron it is true like most great men was too dignified to utter any
joke but a dull one it was always enforced however by a bumper of
excellent hockheimer and even a dull joke at one's own table served
up with jolly old wine is irresistible many good things were said by
poorer and keener wits that would not bear repeating except on similar
occasions many sly speeches whispered in ladies ears that almost
convulsed them with suppressed laughter and a song or two roared out
by a poor but merry and broad-faced cousin of the baron that absolutely
made the maiden aunts hold up their fans

amidst all this revelry the stranger guest maintained a most singular
and unseasonable gravity his countenance assumed a deeper cast of
dejection as the evening advanced and strange as it may appear even
the baron's jokes seemed only to render him the more melancholy at
times he was lost in thought and at times there was a perturbed and
restless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease
his conversations with the bride became more and more earnest and
mysterious lowering clouds began to steal over the fair serenity of her
brow and tremors to run through her tender frame

all this could not escape the notice of the company their gayety was
chilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom their spirits were
infected whispers and glances were interchanged accompanied by shrugs
and dubious shakes of the head the song and the laugh grew less and
less frequent there were dreary pauses in the conversation which were
at length succeeded by wild tales and supernatural legends one
dismal story produced another still more dismal and the baron nearly
frightened some of the ladies into hysterics with the history of the
goblin horseman that carried away the fair leonora a dreadful story
which has since been put into excellent verse and is read and believed
by all the world

the bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention he kept
his eyes steadily fixed on the baron and as the story drew to a close
began gradually to rise from his seat growing taller and taller until
in the baron's entranced eye he seemed almost to tower into a giant
the moment the tale was finished he heaved a deep sigh and took a
solemn farewell of the company they were all amazement the baron was
perfectly thunderstruck

what going to leave the castle at midnight why everything was
prepared for his reception a chamber was ready for him if he wished to
retire

the stranger shook his head mournfully and mysteriously i must lay my
head in a different chamber to-night

there was something in this reply and the tone in which it was uttered
that made the baron's heart misgive him but he rallied his forces and
repeated his hospitable entreaties

the stranger shook his head silently but positively at every offer
and waving his farewell to the company stalked slowly out of the hall
the maiden aunts were absolutely petrified the bride hung her head and
a tear stole to her eye

the baron followed the stranger to the great court of the castle where
the black charger stood pawing the earth and snorting with impatience
when they had reached the portal whose deep archway was dimly lighted
by a cresset the stranger paused and addressed the baron in a hollow
tone of voice which the vaulted roof rendered still more sepulchral

now that we are a lone said he i will impart to you the reason of
my going i have a solemn an indispensable engagement 

why said the baron cannot you send some one in your place

it admits of no substitute i must attend it in person i must away to
wurtzburg cathedral 

ay said the baron plucking up spirit but not until
to-morrow to-morrow you shall take your bride there

no no replied the stranger with tenfold solemnity my engagement
is with no bride the worms the worms expect me i am a dead man i
have been slain by robbers my body lies at wurtzburg at midnight i am
to be buried the grave is waiting for me i must keep my appointment

he sprang on his black charger dashed over the drawbridge and the
clattering of his horse's hoofs was lost in the whistling of the night
blast

the baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation and related
what had passed two ladies fainted outright others sickened at the
idea of having banqueted with a spectre it was the opinion of some that
this might be the wild huntsman famous in german legend some talked of
mountain-sprites of wood-demons and of other supernatural beings with
which the good people of germany have been so grievously harassed since
time immemorial one of the poor relations ventured to suggest that it
might be some sportive evasion of the young cavalier and that the
very gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy a
personage this however drew on him the indignation of the whole
company and especially of the baron who looked upon him as little
better than an infidel so that he was fain to abjure his heresy as
speedily as possible and come into the faith of the true believers

but whatever may have been the doubts entertained they were completely
put to an end by the arrival next day of regular missives confirming the
intelligence of the young count's murder and his interment in wurtzburg
cathedral

the dismay at the castle may well be imagined the baron shut himself up
in his chamber the guests who had come to rejoice with him could not
think of abandoning him in his distress they wandered about the courts
or collected in groups in the hall shaking their heads and shrugging
their shoulders at the troubles of so good a man and sat longer than
ever at table and ate and drank more stoutly than ever by way of
keeping up their spirits but the situation of the widowed bride was
the most pitiable to have lost a husband before she had even embraced
him and such a husband if the very spectre could be so gracious and
noble what must have been the living man she filled the house with
lamentations

on the night of the second day of her widowhood she had retired to her
chamber accompanied by one of her aunts who insisted on sleeping with
her the aunt who was one of the best tellers of ghost-stories in all
germany had just been recounting one of her longest and had fallen
asleep in the very midst of it the chamber was remote and overlooked a
small garden the niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the rising
moon as they trembled on the leaves of an aspen tree before the lattice
the castle clock had just tolled midnight when a soft strain of music
stole up from the garden she rose hastily from her bed and stepped
lightly to the window a tall figure stood among the shadows of
the trees as it raised its head a beam of moonlight fell upon the
countenance heaven and earth she beheld the spectre bridegroom a loud
shriek at that moment burst upon her ear and her aunt who had been
awakened by the music and had followed her silently to the window fell
into her arms when she looked again the spectre had disappeared

of the two females the aunt now required the most soothing for she was
perfectly beside herself with terror as to the young lady there was
something even in the spectre of her lover that seemed endearing there
was still the semblance of manly beauty and though the shadow of a man
is but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a lovesick girl
yet where the substance is not to be had even that is consoling the
aunt declared she would never sleep in that chamber again the niece
for once was refractory and declared as strongly that she would sleep
in no other in the castle the consequence was that she had to sleep in
it alone but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story
of the spectre lest she should be denied the only melancholy pleasure
left her on earth that of inhabiting the chamber over which the
guardian shade of her lover kept its nightly vigils

how long the good old lady would have observed this promise is
uncertain for she dearly loved to talk of the marvellous and there is
a triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story it is however
still quoted in the neighborhood as a memorable instance of female
secrecy that she kept it to herself for a whole week when she was
suddenly absolved from all further restraint by intelligence brought to
the breakfast-table one morning that the young lady was not to be found
her room was empty the bed had not been slept in the window was open
and the bird had flown

the astonishment and concern with which the intelligence was received
can only be imagined by those who have witnessed the agitation which the
mishaps of a great man cause among his friends even the poor relations
paused for a moment from the indefatigable labors of the trencher when
the aunt who had at first been struck speechless wrung her hands
and shrieked out the goblin the goblin she's carried away by the
goblin

in a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden and
concluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride two of the
domestics corroborated the opinion for they had heard the clattering of
a horse's hoofs down the mountain about midnight and had no doubt that
it was the spectre on his black charger bearing her away to the tomb
all present were struck with the direful probability for events of
the kind are extremely common in germany as many well-authenticated
histories bear witness

what a lamentable situation was that of the poor baron what a
heartrending dilemma for a fond father and a member of the great family
of katzenellenbogen his only daughter had either been rapt away to the
grave or he was to have some wood-demon for a son-in-law and perchance
a troop of goblin grandchildren as usual he was completely bewildered
and all the castle in an uproar the men were ordered to take horse and
scour every road and path and glen of the odenwald the baron himself
had just drawn on his jack-boots girded on his sword and was about
to mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest when he was
brought to a pause by a new apparition a lady was seen approaching the
castle mounted on a palfrey attended by a cavalier on horseback she
galloped up to the gate sprang from her horse and falling at the
baron's feet embraced his knees it was his lost daughter and her
companion the spectre bridegroom the baron was astounded he looked
at his daughter then at the spectre and almost doubted the evidence of
his senses the latter too was wonderfully improved in his appearance
since his visit to the world of spirits his dress was splendid and
set off a noble figure of manly symmetry he was no longer pale and
melancholy his fine countenance was flushed with the glow of youth and
joy rioted in his large dark eye

the mystery was soon cleared up the cavalier for in truth as you
must have known all the while he was no goblin announced himself as
sir herman von starkenfaust he related his adventure with the young
count he told how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the
unwelcome tidings but that the eloquence of the baron had interrupted
him in every attempt to tell his tale how the sight of the bride had
completely captivated him and that to pass a few hours near her he
had tacitly suffered the mistake to continue how he had been sorely
perplexed in what way to make a decent retreat until the baron's
goblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit how fearing the feudal
hostility of the family he had repeated his visits by stealth had
haunted the garden beneath the young lady's window had wooed had
won had borne away in triumph and in a word had wedded the fair

under any other circumstances the baron would have been inflexible for
he was tenacious of paternal authority and devoutly obstinate in all
family feuds but he loved his daughter he had lamented her as lost
he rejoiced to find her still alive and though her husband was of
a hostile house yet thank heaven he was not a goblin there was
something it must be acknowledged that did not exactly accord with his
notions of strict veracity in the joke the knight had passed upon him of
his being a dead man but several old friends present who had served
in the wars assured him that every stratagem was excusable in love
and that the cavalier was entitled to especial privilege having lately
served as a trooper

matters therefore were happily arranged the baron pardoned the young
couple on the spot the revels at the castle were resumed the
poor relations overwhelmed this new member of the family with
loving-kindness he was so gallant so generous and so rich the
aunts it is true were somewhat scandalized that their system of strict
seclusion and passive obedience should be so badly exemplified but
attributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows grated
one of them was particularly mortified at having her marvellous story
marred and that the only spectre she had ever seen should turn out a
counterfeit but the niece seemed perfectly happy at having found him
substantial flesh and blood and so the story ends




westminster abbey

 when i behold with deep astonishment
 to famous westminster how there resorte
 living in brasse or stoney monument
 the princes and the worthies of all sorte
 doe not i see reformde nobilitie
 without contempt or pride or ostentation
 and looke upon offenselesse majesty
 naked of pomp or earthly domination
 and how a play-game of a painted stone
 contents the quiet now and silent sprites
 whome all the world which late they stood upon
 could not content nor quench their appetites
 life is a frost of cold felicitie
 and death the thaw of all our vanitie
 christolero's epigrams by t b 

on one of those sober and rather melancholy days in the latter part of
autumn when the shadows of morning and evening almost mingle together
and throw a gloom over the decline of the year i passed several hours
in rambling about westminster abbey there was something congenial to
the season in the mournful magnificence of the old pile and as i passed
its threshold it seemed like stepping back into the regions of antiquity
and losing myself among the shades of former ages

i entered from the inner court of westminster school through a long
low vaulted passage that had an almost subterranean look being dimly
lighted in one part by circular perforations in the massive walls
through this dark avenue i had a distant view of the cloisters with
the figure of an old verger in his black gown moving along their shadowy
vaults and seeming like a spectre from one of the neighboring tombs
the approach to the abbey through these gloomy monastic remains prepares
the mind for its solemn contemplation the cloisters still retain
something of the quiet and seclusion of former days the gray walls are
discolored by damps and crumbling with age a coat of hoary moss has
gathered over the inscriptions of the mural monuments and obscured the
death's heads and other funeral emblems the sharp touches of the chisel
are gone from the rich tracery of the arches the roses which adorned
the keystones have lost their leafy beauty everything bears marks of
the gradual dilapidations of time which yet has something touching and
pleasing in its very decay

the sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the square of
the cloisters beaming upon a scanty plot of grass in the centre
and lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with a kind of dusky
splendor from between the arcades the eye glanced up to a bit of blue
sky or a passing cloud and beheld the sun-gilt pinnacles of the abbey
towering into the azure heaven

as i paced the cloisters sometimes contemplating this mingled
picture of glory and decay and sometimes endeavoring to decipher the
inscriptions on the tombstones which formed the pavement beneath my
feet my eye was attracted to three figures rudely carved in relief
but nearly worn away by the footsteps of many generations they were
the effigies of three of the early abbots the epitaphs were entirely
effaced the names alone remained having no doubt been renewed in later
times vitalis abbas and gislebertus crispinus abbas 
and laurentius abbas i remained some little while musing over
these casual relics of antiquity thus left like wrecks upon this distant
shore of time telling no tale but that such beings had been and had
perished teaching no moral but the futility of that pride which hopes
still to exact homage in its ashes and to live in an inscription a
little longer and even these faint records will be obliterated and the
monument will cease to be a memorial whilst i was yet looking down
upon the gravestones i was roused by the sound of the abbey clock
reverberating from buttress to buttress and echoing among the cloisters
it is almost startling to hear this warning of departed time sounding
among the tombs and telling the lapse of the hour which like a billow
has rolled us onward towards the grave i pursued my walk to an
arched door opening to the interior of the abbey on entering here the
magnitude of the building breaks fully upon the mind contrasted with
the vaults of the cloisters the eyes gaze with wonder at clustered
columns of gigantic dimensions with arches springing from them to such
an amazing height and man wandering about their bases shrunk into
insignificance in comparison with his own handiwork the spaciousness
and gloom of this vast edifice produce a profound and mysterious awe
we step cautiously and softly about as if fearful of disturbing the
hallowed silence of the tomb while every footfall whispers along the
walls and chatters among the sepulchres making us more sensible of the
quiet we have interrupted

it seems as if the awful nature of the place presses down upon the soul
and hushes the beholder into noiseless reverence we feel that we are
surrounded by the congregated bones of the great men of past times who
have filled history with their deeds and the earth with their renown

and yet it almost provokes a smile at the vanity of human ambition
to see how they are crowded together and jostled in the dust what
parsimony is observed in doling out a scanty nook a gloomy corner a
little portion of earth to those whom when alive kingdoms could not
satisfy and how many shapes and forms and artifices are devised to
catch the casual notice of the passenger and save from forgetfulness
for a few short years a name which once aspired to occupy ages of the
world's thought and admiration

i passed some time in poet's corner which occupies an end of one of
the transepts or cross aisles of the abbey the monuments are generally
simple for the lives of literary men afford no striking themes for
the sculptor shakespeare and addison have statues erected to their
memories but the greater part have busts medallions and sometimes
mere inscriptions notwithstanding the simplicity of these memorials
i have always observed that the visitors to the abbey remained longest
about them a kinder and fonder feeling takes place of that cold
curiosity or vague admiration with which they gaze on the splendid
monuments of the great and the heroic they linger about these as about
the tombs of friends and companions for indeed there is something of
companionship between the author and the reader other men are known
to posterity only through the medium of history which is continually
growing faint and obscure but the intercourse between the author and
his fellowmen is ever new active and immediate he has lived for them
more than for himself he has sacrificed surrounding enjoyments and
shut himself up from the delights of social life that he might the more
intimately commune with distant minds and distant ages well may the
world cherish his renown for it has been purchased not by deeds of
violence and blood but by the diligent dispensation of pleasure
well may posterity be grateful to his memory for he has left it an
inheritance not of empty names and sounding actions but whole treasures
of wisdom bright gems of thought and golden veins of language

from poet's corner i continued my stroll towards that part of the abbey
which contains the sepulchres of the kings i wandered among what once
were chapels but which are now occupied by the tombs and monuments
of the great at every turn i met with some illustrious name or the
cognizance of some powerful house renowned in history as the eye
darts into these dusky chambers of death it catches glimpses of quaint
effigies some kneeling in niches as if in devotion others stretched
upon the tombs with hands piously pressed together warriors in armor
as if reposing after battle prelates with crosiers and mitres and
nobles in robes and coronets lying as it were in state in glancing
over this scene so strangely populous yet where every form is so still
and silent it seems almost as if we were treading a mansion of that
fabled city where every being had been suddenly transmuted into stone

i paused to contemplate a tomb on which lay the effigy of a knight in
complete armor a large buckler was on one arm the hands were pressed
together in supplication upon the breast the face was almost covered by
the morion the legs were crossed in token of the warrior's having been
engaged in the holy war it was the tomb of a crusader of one of those
military enthusiasts who so strangely mingled religion and romance
and whose exploits form the connecting link between fact and fiction
between the history and the fairytale there is something extremely
picturesque in the tombs of these adventurers decorated as they are
with rude armorial bearings and gothic sculpture they comport with the
antiquated chapels in which they are generally found and in considering
them the imagination is apt to kindle with the legendary associations
the romantic fiction the chivalrous pomp and pageantry which poetry has
spread over the wars for the sepulchre of christ they are the relics
of times utterly gone by of beings passed from recollection of customs
and manners with which ours have no affinity they are like objects from
some strange and distant land of which we have no certain knowledge
and about which all our conceptions are vague and visionary there is
something extremely solemn and awful in those effigies on gothic tombs
extended as if in the sleep of death or in the supplication of the dying
hour they have an effect infinitely more impressive on my feelings
than the fanciful attitudes the over wrought conceits the allegorical
groups which abound on modern monuments i have been struck also with
the superiority of many of the old sepulchral inscriptions there was a
noble way in former times of saying things simply and yet saying
them proudly and i do not know an epitaph that breathes a loftier
consciousness of family worth and honorable lineage than one which
affirms of a noble house that all the brothers were brave and all the
sisters virtuous

in the opposite transept to poet's corner stands a monument which is
among the most renowned achievements of modern art but which to
me appears horrible rather than sublime it is the tomb of mrs
nightingale by roubillac the bottom of the monument is represented
as throwing open its marble doors and a sheeted skeleton is starting
forth the shroud is falling from his fleshless frame as he launches his
dart at his victim she is sinking into her affrighted husband's arms
who strives with vain and frantic effort to avert the blow the whole
is executed with terrible truth and spirit we almost fancy we hear
the gibbering yell of triumph bursting from the distended jaws of the
spectre but why should we thus seek to clothe death with unnecessary
terrors and to spread horrors round the tomb of those we love the
grave should be surrounded by everything that might inspire tenderness
and veneration for the dead or that might win the living to virtue it
is the place not of disgust and dismay but of sorrow and meditation

while wandering about these gloomy vaults and silent aisles studying
the records of the dead the sound of busy existence from without
occasionally reaches the ear the rumbling of the passing equipage the
murmur of the multitude or perhaps the light laugh of pleasure the
contrast is striking with the deathlike repose around and it has a
strange effect upon the feelings thus to hear the surges of active life
hurrying along and beating against the very walls of the sepulchre

i continued in this way to move from tomb to tomb and from chapel
to chapel the day was gradually wearing away the distant tread of
loiterers about the abbey grew less and less frequent the sweet-tongued
bell was summoning to evening prayers and i saw at a distance the
choristers in their white surplices crossing the aisle and entering
the choir i stood before the entrance to henry the seventh's chapel a
flight of steps leads up to it through a deep and gloomy but magnificent
arch great gates of brass richly and delicately wrought turn heavily
upon their hinges as if proudly reluctant to admit the feet of common
mortals into this most gorgeous of sepulchres

on entering the eye is astonished by the pomp of architecture and the
elaborate beauty of sculptured detail the very walls are wrought into
universal ornament encrusted with tracery and scooped into niches
crowded with the statues of saints and martyrs stone seems by the
cunning labor of the chisel to have been robbed of its weight and
density suspended aloft as if by magic and the fretted roof achieved
with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb

along the sides of the chapel are the lofty stalls of the knights of
the bath richly carved of oak though with the grotesque decorations
of gothic architecture on the pinnacles of the stalls are affixed the
helmets and crests of the knights with their scarfs and swords
and above them are suspended their banners emblazoned with armorial
bearings and contrasting the splendor of gold and purple and crimson
with the cold gray fretwork of the roof in the midst of this grand
mausoleum stands the sepulchre of its founder his effigy with that of
his queen extended on a sumptuous tomb and the whole surrounded by a
superbly-wrought brazen railing

there is a sad dreariness in this magnificence this strange mixture of
tombs and trophies these emblems of living and aspiring ambition
close beside mementos which show the dust and oblivion in which all
must sooner or later terminate nothing impresses the mind with a deeper
feeling of loneliness than to tread the silent and deserted scene of
former throng and pageant on looking round on the vacant stalls of
the knights and their esquires and on the rows of dusty but gorgeous
banners that were once borne before them my imagination conjured up the
scene when this hall was bright with the valor and beauty of the land
glittering with the splendor of jewelled rank and military array alive
with the tread of many feet and the hum of an admiring multitude all
had passed away the silence of death had settled again upon the place
interrupted only by the casual chirping of birds which had found
their way into the chapel and built their nests among its friezes and
pendants sure signs of solitariness and desertion

when i read the names inscribed on the banners they were those of men
scattered far and wide about the world some tossing upon distant seas
some under arms in distant lands some mingling in the busy intrigues
of courts and cabinets all seeking to deserve one more distinction in
this mansion of shadowy honors the melancholy reward of a monument

two small aisles on each side of this chapel present a touching instance
of the equality of the grave which brings down the oppressor to a
level with the oppressed and mingles the dust of the bitterest enemies
together in one is the sepulchre of the haughty elizabeth in the other
is that of her victim the lovely and unfortunate mary not an hour in
the day but some ejaculation of pity is uttered over the fate of
the latter mingled with indignation at her oppressor the walls of
elizabeth's sepulchre continually echo with the sighs of sympathy heaved
at the grave of her rival

a peculiar melancholy reigns over the aisle where mary lies buried the
light struggles dimly through windows darkened by dust the greater part
of the place is in deep shadow and the walls are stained and tinted by
time and weather a marble figure of mary is stretched upon the tomb
round which is an iron railing much corroded bearing her national
emblem the thistle i was weary with wandering and sat down to
rest myself by the monument revolving in my mind the chequered and
disastrous story of poor mary

the sound of casual footsteps had ceased from the abbey i could only
hear now and then the distant voice of the priest repeating the
evening service and the faint responses of the choir these paused for
a time and all was hushed the stillness the desertion and obscurity
that were gradually prevailing around gave a deeper and more solemn
interest to the place

 for in the silent grave no conversation
 no joyful tread of friends no voice of lovers
 no careful father's counsel nothing's heard
 for nothing is but all oblivion
 dust and an endless darkness

suddenly the notes of the deep-laboring organ burst upon the ear
falling with doubled and redoubled intensity and rolling as it were
huge billows of sound how well do their volume and grandeur accord
with this mighty building with what pomp do they swell through its vast
vaults and breathe their awful harmony through these caves of death
and make the silent sepulchre vocal and now they rise in triumphant
acclamation heaving higher and higher their accordant notes and piling
sound on sound and now they pause and the soft voices of the choir
break out into sweet gushes of melody they soar aloft and warble along
the roof and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the pure
airs of heaven again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders
compressing air into music and rolling it forth upon the soul what
long-drawn cadences what solemn sweeping concords it grows more and
more dense and powerful it fills the vast pile and seems to jar the
very walls the ear is stunned the senses are overwhelmed and now it
is winding up in full jubilee it is rising from the earth to heaven
the very soul seems rapt away and floated upwards on this swelling tide
of harmony

i sat for some time lost in that kind of reverie which a strain of
music is apt sometimes to inspire the shadows of evening were gradually
thickening round me the monuments began to cast deeper and deeper
gloom and the distant clock again gave token of the slowly waning day

i rose and prepared to leave the abbey as i descended the flight of
steps which lead into the body of the building my eye was caught by the
shrine of edward the confessor and i ascended the small staircase that
conducts to it to take from thence a general survey of this wilderness
of tombs the shrine is elevated upon a kind of platform and close
around it are the sepulchres of various kings and queens from this
eminence the eye looks down between pillars and funeral trophies to
the chapels and chambers below crowded with tombs where warriors
prelates courtiers and statesmen lie mouldering in their beds of
darkness close by me stood the great chair of coronation rudely
carved of oak in the barbarous taste of a remote and gothic age the
scene seemed almost as if contrived with theatrical artifice to produce
an effect upon the beholder here was a type of the beginning and the
end of human pomp and power here it was literally but a step from the
throne to the sepulchre would not one think that these incongruous
mementos had been gathered together as a lesson to living greatness to
show it even in the moment of its proudest exaltation the neglect
and dishonor to which it must soon arrive how soon that crown which
encircles its brow must pass away and it must lie down in the dust and
disgraces of the tomb and be trampled upon by the feet of the meanest
of the multitude for strange to tell even the grave is here no longer
a sanctuary there is a shocking levity in some natures which leads them
to sport with awful and hallowed things and there are base minds
which delight to revenge on the illustrious dead the abject homage and
grovelling servility which they pay to the living the coffin of edward
the confessor has been broken open and his remains despoiled of their
funereal ornaments the sceptre has been stolen from the hand of the
imperious elizabeth and the effigy of henry the fifth lies headless
not a royal monument but bears some proof how false and fugitive is the
homage of mankind some are plundered some mutilated some covered with
ribaldry and insult all more or less outraged and dishonored

the last beams of day were now faintly streaming through the painted
windows in the high vaults above me the lower parts of the abbey were
already wrapped in the obscurity of twilight the chapels and aisles
grew darker and darker the effigies of the kings faded into shadows
the marble figures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in the
uncertain light the evening breeze crept through the aisles like the
cold breath of the grave and even the distant footfall of a verger
traversing the poet's corner had something strange and dreary in its
sound i slowly retraced my morning's walk and as i passed out at the
portal of the cloisters the door closing with a jarring noise behind
me filled the whole building with echoes

i endeavored to form some arrangement in my mind of the objects i
had been contemplating but found they were already falling into
indistinctness and confusion names inscriptions trophies had all
become confounded in my recollection though i had scarcely taken my
foot from off the threshold what thought i is this vast assemblage
of sepulchres but a treasury of humiliation a huge pile of reiterated
homilies on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of oblivion it
is indeed the empire of death his great shadowy palace where he sits
in state mocking at the relics of human glory and spreading dust and
forgetfulness on the monuments of princes how idle a boast after all
is the immortality of a name time is ever silently turning over his
pages we are too much engrossed by the story of the present to think
of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past and
each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten the idol of
to-day pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection and will in
turn be supplanted by his successor of tomorrow our fathers says sir
thomas browne find their graves in our short memories and sadly tell
us how we may be buried in our survivors history fades into fable
fact becomes clouded with doubt and controversy the inscription
moulders from the tablet the statue falls from the pedestal columns
arches pyramids what are they but heaps of sand and their epitaphs
but characters written in the dust what is the security of a tomb or
the perpetuity of an embalmment the remains of alexander the great have
been scattered to the wind and his empty sarcophagus is now the mere
curiosity of a museum the egyptian mummies which cambyses or time
hath spared avarice now consumeth mizraim cures wounds and pharaoh is
sold for balsams

what then is to ensure this pile which now towers above me from sharing
the fate of mightier mausoleums the time must come when its gilded
vaults which now spring so loftily shall lie in rubbish beneath the
feet when instead of the sound of melody and praise the wind shall
whistle through the broken arches and the owl hoot from the shattered
tower when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy mansions of
death and the ivy twine round the fallen column and the fox-glove hang
its blossoms about the nameless urn as if in mockery of the dead
thus man passes away his name passes from record and recollection his
history is as a tale that is told and his very monument becomes a ruin

christmas

but is old old good old christmas gone nothing but the hair of his
good gray old head and beard left well i will have that seeing i
cannot have more of him hue and cry after christmas

 a man might then behold
 at christmas in each hall
 good fires to curb the cold
 and meat for great and small
 the neighbors were friendly bidden
 and all had welcome true
 the poor from the gates were not chidden
 when this old cap was new
 old song

nothing in england exercises a more delightful spell over my imagination
than the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural games of former
times they recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in the may morning
of life when as yet i only knew the world through books and believed
it to be all that poets had painted it and they bring with them the
flavor of those honest days of yore in which perhaps with equal
fallacy i am apt to think the world was more homebred social and
joyous than at present i regret to say that they are daily growing
more and more faint being gradually worn away by time but still more
obliterated by modern fashion they resemble those picturesque morsels
of gothic architecture which we see crumbling in various parts of the
country partly dilapidated by the waste of ages and partly lost in the
additions and alterations of latter days poetry however clings with
cherishing fondness about the rural game and holiday revel from which
it has derived so many of its themes as the ivy winds its rich foliage
about the gothic arch and mouldering tower gratefully repaying their
support by clasping together their tottering remains and as it were
embalming them in verdure

of all the old festivals however that of christmas awakens the
strongest and most heartfelt associations there is a tone of solemn and
sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality and lifts the spirit to
a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment the services of the church
about this season are extremely tender and inspiring they dwell on the
beautiful story of the origin of our faith and the pastoral scenes that
accompanied its announcement they gradually increase in fervor and
pathos during the season of advent until they break forth in full
jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men i do not
know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to hear the
full choir and the pealing organ performing a christmas anthem in a
cathedral and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant
harmony

it is a beautiful arrangement also derived from days of yore that
this festival which commemorates the announcement of the religion
of peace and love has been made the season for gathering together of
family connections and drawing closer again those bands of kindred
hearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are
continually operating to cast loose of calling back the children of a
family who have launched forth in life and wandered widely asunder once
more to assemble about the paternal hearth that rallying-place of the
affections there to grow young and loving again among the endearing
mementos of childhood

there is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to
the festivity of christmas at other times we derive a great portion of
our pleasures from the mere beauties of nature our feelings sally forth
and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape and we live abroad
and everywhere the song of the bird the murmur of the stream the
breathing fragrance of spring the soft voluptuousness of summer the
golden pomp of autumn earth with its mantle of refreshing green and
heaven with it deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence all
fill us with mute but exquisite delight and we revel in the luxury of
mere sensation but in the depth of winter when nature lies despoiled
of every charm and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow we turn for
our gratifications to moral sources the dreariness and desolation of
the landscape the short gloomy days and darksome nights while they
circumscribe our wanderings shut in our feelings also from rambling
abroad and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasure of the social
circle our thoughts are more concentrated our friendly sympathies more
aroused we feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society
and are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for
enjoyment heart calleth unto heart and we draw our pleasures from the
deep wells of loving-kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of our
bosoms and which when resorted to furnish forth the pure element of
domestic felicity

the pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room
filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire the ruddy blaze
diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room and lights
up each countenance in a kindlier welcome where does the honest face of
hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile where is the
shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent than by the winter fireside
and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the hall claps
the distant door whistles about the casement and rumbles down the
chimney what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and
sheltered security with which we look round upon the comfortable chamber
and the scene of domestic hilarity

the english from the great prevalence of rural habit throughout
every class of society have always been found of those festivals and
holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life and
they were in former days particularly observant of the religious and
social rites of christmas it is inspiring to read even the dry details
which some antiquaries have given of the quaint humors the burlesque
pageants the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship with
which this festival was celebrated it seemed to throw open every door
and unlock every heart it brought the peasant and the peer together
and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness
the old halls of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and
the christmas carol and their ample boards groaned under the weight of
hospitality even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with
green decorations of bay and holly the cheerful fire glanced its rays
through the lattice inviting the passengers to raise the latch and join
the gossip knot huddled round the hearth beguiling the long evening with
legendary jokes and oft-told christmas tales

one of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it
has made among the hearty old holiday customs it has completely taken
off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments
of life and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished
but certainly a less characteristic surface many of the games and
ceremonials of christmas have entirely disappeared and like the
sherris sack of old falstaff are become matters of speculation and
dispute among commentators they flourished in times full of spirit
and lustihood when men enjoyed life roughly but heartily and
vigorously times wild and picturesque which have furnished poetry with
its richest materials and the drama with its most attractive variety of
characters and manners the world has become more worldly there is
more of dissipation and less of enjoyment pleasure has expanded into a
broader but a shallower stream and has forsaken many of those deep
and quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of
domestic life society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone
but it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities its homebred
feelings its honest fireside delights the traditionary customs
of golden-hearted antiquity its feudal hospitalities and lordly
wassailings have passed away with the baronial castles and stately
manor-houses in which they were celebrated they comported with the
shadowy hall the great oaken gallery and the tapestried parlor but
are unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the
modern villa

shorn however as it is of its ancient and festive honors christmas
is still a period of delightful excitement in england it is gratifying
to see that home-feeling completely aroused which holds so powerful a
place in every english bosom the preparations making on every side
for the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred the
presents of good cheer passing and repassing those tokens of regard and
quickeners of kind feelings the evergreens distributed about houses
and churches emblems of peace and gladness all these have the most
pleasing effect in producing fond associations and kindling benevolent
sympathies even the sound of the waits rude as may be their
minstrelsy breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the
effect of perfect harmony as i have been awakened by them in that still
and solemn hour when deep sleep falleth upon man i have listened
with a hushed delight and connecting them with the sacred and
joyous occasion have almost fancied them into another celestial choir
announcing peace and good-will to mankind

how delightfully the imagination when wrought upon by these moral
influences turns everything to melody and beauty the very crowing
of the cock heard sometimes in the profound repose of the country
telling the night-watches to his feathery dames was thought by the
common people to announce the approach of this sacred festival

 some say that ever gainst that season comes
 wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated
 this bird of dawning singeth all night long
 and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
 the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
 no fairy takes no witch hath power to charm
 so hallow'd and so gracious is the time

amidst the general call to happiness the bustle of the spirits and
stir of the affections which prevail at this period what bosom can
remain insensible it is indeed the season of regenerated feeling the
season for kindling not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall but
the genial flame of charity in the heart

the scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile
waste of years and the idea of home fraught with the fragrance of
home-dwelling joys reanimates the drooping spirit as the arabian
breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the
weary pilgrim of the desert

stranger and sojourner as i am in the land though for me no social
hearth may blaze no hospitable roof throw open its doors nor the
warm grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold yet i feel the
influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of
those around me surely happiness is reflective like the light of
heaven and every countenance bright with smiles and glowing with
innocent enjoyment is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a
supreme and ever-shining benevolence he who can turn churlishly away
from contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings and can sit down
darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful may
have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification but he
wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a
merry christmas




the stage-coach

 omne bene
 sine poena
 tempua est ludendi
 venit hora
 absque mora
 libros deponendi
 old holiday school-song

in the preceding paper i have made some general observations on the
christmas festivities of england and am tempted to illustrate them by
some anecdotes of a christmas passed in the country in perusing which
i would most courteously invite my reader to lay aside the austerity of
wisdom and to put on that genuine holiday spirit which is tolerant of
folly and anxious only for amusement

in the course of a december tour in yorkshire i rode for a long
distance in one of the public coaches on the day preceding christmas
the coach was crowded both inside and out with passengers who by
their talk seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or
friends to eat the christmas dinner it was loaded also with hampers of
game and baskets and boxes of delicacies and hares hung dangling their
long ears about the coachman's box presents from distant friends for
the impending feast i had three fine rosy-cheeked school boys for my
fellow-passengers inside full of the buxom health and manly spirit
which i have observed in the children of this country they were
returning home for the holidays in high glee and promising themselves a
world of enjoyment it was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of the
little rogues and the impracticable feats they were to perform during
their six weeks emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book birch
and pedagogue they were full of anticipations of the meeting with the
family and household down to the very cat and dog and of the joy
they were to give their little sisters by the presents with which their
pockets were crammed but the meeting to which they seemed to look
forward with the greatest impatience was with bantam which i found to
be a pony and according to their talk possessed of more virtues than
any steed since the days of bucephalus how he could trot how he could
run and then such leaps as he would take there was not a hedge in the
whole country that he could not clear

they were under the particular guardianship of the coachman to whom
whenever an opportunity presented they addressed a host of questions
and pronounced him one of the best fellows in the world indeed i could
not but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of
the coachman who wore his hat a little on one side and had a large
bunch of christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his coat he
is always a personage full of mighty care and business but he is
particularly so during this season having so many commissions to
execute in consequence of the great interchange of presents and here
perhaps it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers to have a
sketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous
and important class of functionaries who have a dress a manner a
language an air peculiar to themselves and prevalent throughout the
fraternity so that wherever an english stage-coachman may be seen he
cannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery

he has commonly a broad full face curiously mottled with red as if
the blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the
skin he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt
liquors and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of
coats in which he is buried like a cauliflower the upper one reaching
to his heels he wears a broad-brimmed low-crowned hat a huge roll of
colored handkerchief about his neck knowingly knotted and tucked in
at the bosom and has in summer-time a large bouquet of flowers in his
buttonhole the present most probably of some enamored country
lass his waistcoat is commonly of some bright color striped and his
small-clothes extend far below the knees to meet a pair of jockey boots
which reach about halfway up his legs

all this costume is maintained with much precision he has a pride in
having his clothes of excellent materials and notwithstanding the
seeming grossness of his appearance there is still discernible
that neatness and propriety of person which is almost inherent in an
englishman he enjoys great consequence and consideration along the
road has frequent conferences with the village housewives who look
upon him as a man of great trust and dependence and he seems to have
a good understanding with every bright-eyed country lass the moment
he arrives where the horses are to be changed he throws down the reins
with something of an air and abandons the cattle to the care of the
ostler his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another when
off the box his hands are thrust into the pockets of his great coat and
he rolls about the inn-yard with an air of the most absolute lordliness
here he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of ostlers
stableboys shoeblacks and those nameless hangers-on that infest
inns and taverns and run errands and do all kind of odd jobs for the
privilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the leakage
of the tap-room these all look up to him as to an oracle treasure up
his cant phrases echo his opinions about horses and other topics of
jockey lore and above all endeavor to imitate his air and carriage
every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the
pockets rolls in his gait talks slang and is an embryo coachey

perhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in
my own mind that i fancied i saw cheerfulness in every countenance
throughout the journey a stage-coach however carries animation always
with it and puts the world in motion as it whirls along the horn
sounded at the entrance of the village produces a general bustle some
hasten forth to meet friends some with bundles and bandboxes to secure
places and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the
group that accompanies them in the meantime the coachman has a world of
small commissions to execute sometimes he delivers a hare or pheasant
sometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a public
house and sometimes with knowing leer and words of sly import
hands to some half-blushing half-laughing house-maid an odd-shaped
billet-doux from some rustic admirer as the coach rattles through the
village every one runs to the window and you have glances on every side
of fresh country faces and blooming giggling girls at the corners are
assembled juntos of village idlers and wise men who take their stations
there for the important purpose of seeing company pass but the sagest
knot is generally at the blacksmith's to whom the passing of the coach
is an event fruitful of much speculation the smith with the horse's
heel in his lap pauses as the vehicle whirls by the cyclops round the
anvil suspend their ringing hammers and suffer the iron to grow cool
and the sooty spectre in brown paper cap laboring at the bellows leans
on the handle for a moment and permits the asthmatic engine to heave a
long-drawn sigh while he glares through the murky smoke and sulphurous
gleams of the smithy

perhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual
animation to the country for it seemed to me as if everybody was in
good looks and good spirits game poultry and other luxuries of
the table were in brisk circulation in the villages the grocers
butchers and fruiterers shops were thronged with customers the
housewives were stirring briskly about putting their dwellings in
order and the glossy branches of holly with their bright-red berries
began to appear at the windows the scene brought to mind an old
writer's account of christmas preparation now capons and hens besides
turkeys geese and ducks with beef and mutton must all die for in
twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little now
plums and spice sugar and honey square it among pies and broth now
or never must music be in tune for the youth must dance and sing to
get them a heat while the aged sit by the fire the country maid leaves
half her market and must be sent again if she forgets a pack of cards
on christmas eve great is the contention of holly and ivy whether
master or dame wears the breeches dice and cards benefit the butler
and if the cook do not lack wit he will sweetly lick his fingers

i was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a shout from
my little travelling companions they had been looking out of the
coach-windows for the last few miles recognizing every tree and cottage
as they approached home and now there was a general burst of joy
there's john and there's old carlo and there's bantam cried the
happy little rogues clapping their hands

at the end of a lane there was an old sober-looking servant in livery
waiting for them he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer and by
the redoubtable bantam a little old rat of a pony with a shaggy mane
and long rusty tail who stood dozing quietly by the roadside little
dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him

i was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped
about the steady old footman and hugged the pointer who wriggled his
whole body for joy but bantam was the great object of interest all
wanted to mount at once and it was with some difficulty that john
arranged that they should ride by turns and the eldest should ride
first

off they set at last one on the pony with the dog bounding and barking
before him and the others holding john's hands both talking at
once and overpowering him with questions about home and with school
anecdotes i looked after them with a feeling in which i do not know
whether pleasure or melancholy predominated for i was reminded of those
days when like them i had known neither care nor sorrow and a holiday
was the summit of earthly felicity we stopped a few moments afterwards
to water the horses and on resuming our route a turn of the road
brought us in sight of a neat country-seat i could just distinguish the
forms of a lady and two young girls in the portico and i saw my
little comrades with bantam carlo and old john trooping along the
carriage-road i leaned out of the coach-window in hopes of witnessing
the happy meeting but a grove of trees shut it from my sight

in the evening we reached a village where i had determined to pass the
night as we drove into the great gateway of the inn i saw on one side
the light of a rousing kitchen-fire beaming through a window i entered
and admired for the hundredth time that picture of convenience
neatness and broad honest enjoyment the kitchen of an english inn
it was of spacious dimensions hung round with copper and tin vessels
highly polished and decorated here and there with a christmas green
hams tongues and flitches of bacon were suspended from the ceiling a
smoke-jack made its ceaseless clanking beside the fireplace and a clock
ticked in one corner a well-scoured deal table extended along one side
of the kitchen with a cold round of beef and other hearty viands
upon it over which two foaming tankards of ale seemed mounting guard
travellers of inferior order were preparing to attack this stout repast
while others sat smoking and gossiping over their ale on two high-backed
oaken settles beside the fire trim housemaids were hurrying backwards
and forwards under the directions of a fresh bustling landlady but
still seizing an occasional moment to exchange a flippant word and have
a rallying laugh with the group round the fire the scene completely
realized poor robin's humble idea of the comforts of midwinter

 now trees their leafy hats do bare
 to reverence winter's silver hair
 a handsome hostess merry host
 a pot of ale now and a toast
 tobacco and a good coal fire
 are things this season doth require


 poor robin's almanack 


i had not been long at the inn when a post-chaise drove up to the door
a young gentleman stept out and by the light of the lamps i caught a
glimpse of a countenance which i thought i knew i moved forward to
get a nearer view when his eye caught mine i was not mistaken it was
frank bracebridge a sprightly good-humored young fellow with whom i
had once travelled on the continent our meeting was extremely cordial
for the countenance of an old fellow-traveller always brings up
the recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes odd adventures and
excellent jokes to discuss all these in a transient interview 
at an
inn was impossible and finding that i was not pressed for time and was
merely making a tour of observation he insisted that i should give him
a day or two at his father's country-seat to which he was going to pass
the holidays and which lay at a few miles distance it is better
than eating a solitary christmas dinner at an inn said he and i can
assure you of a hearty welcome in something of the old-fashioned style
his reasoning was cogent and i must confess the preparation i had seen
for universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little
impatient of my loneliness i closed therefore at once with his
invitation the chaise drove up to the door and in a few moments i was
on my way to the family mansion of the bracebridges


christmas eve

 saint francis and saint benedight
 blesse this house from wicked wight
 from the night-mare and the goblin
 that is hight good fellow robin
 keep it from all evil spirits
 fairies weezels rats and ferrets
 from curfew time
 to the next prime
 cartwright

it was a brilliant moonlight night but extremely cold our chaise
whirled rapidly over the frozen ground the postboy smacked his whip
incessantly and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop he
knows where he is going said my companion laughing and is eager to
arrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants
hall my father you must know is a bigoted devotee of the old school
and prides himself upon keeping up something of old english hospitality
he is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet with nowadays
in its purity the old english country gentleman for our men of fortune
spend so much of their time in town and fashion is carried so much into
the country that the strong rich peculiarities of ancient rural life
are almost polished away my father however from early years took
honest peacham for his textbook instead of chesterfield he determined
in his own mind that there was no condition more truly honorable and
enviable than that of a country gentleman on his paternal lands and
therefore passes the whole of his time on his estate he is a strenuous
advocate for the revival of the old rural games and holiday observances
and is deeply read in the writers ancient and modern who have treated
on the subject indeed his favorite range of reading is among the
authors who flourished at least two centuries since who he insists
wrote and thought more like true englishmen than any of their
successors he even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few
centuries earlier when england was itself and had its peculiar manners
and customs as he lives at some distance from the main road in rather
a lonely part of the country without any rival gentry near him he has
that most enviable of all blessings to an englishman an opportunity
of indulging the bent of his own humor without molestation being
representative of the oldest family in the neighborhood and a great
part of the peasantry being his tenants he is much looked up to and
in general is known simply by the appellation of the squire a title
which has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial
i think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father to
prepare you for any eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd


 peacham's complete gentleman 


we had passed for some time along the wall of a park and at length the
chaise stopped at the gate it was in a heavy magnificent old style
of iron bars fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers
the huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the
family crest close adjoining was the porter's lodge sheltered under
dark fir trees and almost buried in shrubbery

the postboy rang a large porter's bell which resounded though the still
frosty air and was answered by the distant barking of dogs with which
the mansion-house seemed garrisoned an old woman immediately appeared
at the gate as the moonlight fell strongly upon her i had a full view
of a little primitive dame dressed very much in the antique taste with
a neat kerchief and stomacher and her silver hair peeping from under a
cap of snowy whiteness she came curtseying forth with many expressions
of simple joy at seeing her young master her husband it seemed was up
at the house keeping christmas eve in the servants hall they could
not do without him as he was the best hand at a song and story in the
household

my friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to
the hall which was at no great distance while the chaise should follow
on our road wound through a noble avenue of trees among the naked
branches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep
vault of a cloudless sky the lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight
covering of snow which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught
a frosty crystal and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent
vapor stealing up from the low grounds and threatening gradually to
shroud the landscape

my companion looked around him with transport how often said he
have i scampered up this avenue on returning home on school vacations
how often have i played under these trees when a boy i feel a degree of
filial reverence for them as we look up to those who have cherished us
in childhood my father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays
and having us around him on family festivals he used to direct and
superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the
studies of their children he was very particular that we should play
the old english games according to their original form and consulted
old books for precedent and authority for every merrie disport yet i
assure you there never was pedantry so delightful it was the policy
of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the
happiest place in the world and i value this delicious home-feeling as
one of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow

we were interrupted by the clamor of a troop of dogs of all sorts and
sizes mongrel puppy whelp and hound and curs of lower degree
that disturbed by the ring of the porter's bell and the rattling of the
chaise came bounding open-mouthed across the lawn

 the little dogs and all tray blanch
 and sweetheart see they bark at me

cried bracebridge laughing at the sound of his voice the bark was
changed into a yelp of delight and in a moment he was surrounded and
almost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals

we had now come in full view of the old family mansion partly thrown in
deep shadow and partly lit up by the cold moonshine it was an irregular
building of some magnitude and seemed to be of the architecture of
different periods one wing was evidently very ancient with heavy
stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy from among
the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered
with the moonbeams the rest of the house was in the french taste of
charles the second's time having been repaired and altered as my
friend told me by one of his ancestors who returned with that monarch
at the restoration the grounds about the house were laid out in the
old formal manner of artificial flower-beds clipped shrubberies raised
terraces and heavy stone balustrades ornamented with urns a leaden
statue or two and a jet of water the old gentleman i was told was
extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its
original state he admired this fashion in gardening it had an air
of magnificence was courtly and noble and befitting good old family
style the boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening had sprung
up with modern republican notions but did not suit a monarchical
government it smacked of the leveling system i could not help smiling
at this introduction of politics into gardening though i expressed some
apprehension that i should find the old gentleman rather intolerant
in his creed frank assured me however that it was almost the only
instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics and
he believed that he had got this notion from a member of parliament who
once passed a few weeks with him the squire was glad of any argument
to defend his clipped yew trees and formal terraces which had been
occasionally attacked by modern landscape gardeners

as we approached the house we heard the sound of music and now and
then a burst of laughter from one end of the building this bracebridge
said must proceed from the servants hall where a great deal of
revelry was permitted and even encouraged by the squire throughout the
twelve days of christmas provided everything was done conformably to
ancient usage here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind shoe
the wild mare hot cockles steal the white loaf bob apple and snap
dragon the yule-clog and christmas candle were regularly burnt and the
mistletoe with its white berries hung up to the imminent peril of all
the pretty housemaids


 the mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens
 at christmas and the young men have the privilege of
 kissing the girls under it plucking each time a berry from
 the bush when the berries are all plucked the privilege
 ceases


so intent were the servants upon their sports that we had to ring
repeatedly before we could make ourselves heard on our arrival being
announced the squire came out to receive us accompanied by his two
other sons one a young officer in the army home on a leave of absence
the other an oxonian just from the university the squire was a fine
healthy-looking old gentleman with silver hair curling lightly round an
open florid countenance in which the physiognomist with the advantage
like myself of a previous hint or two might discover a singular
mixture of whim and benevolence

the family meeting was warm and affectionate as the evening was far
advanced the squire would not permit us to change our travelling
dresses but ushered us at once to the company which was assembled in
a large old-fashioned hall it was composed of different branches of a
numerous family connection where there were the usual proportion of old
uncles and aunts comfortable married dames superannuated spinsters
blooming country cousins half-fledged striplings and bright-eyed
boarding-school hoydens they were variously occupied some at a round
game of cards others conversing around the fireplace at one end of the
hall was a group of the young folks some nearly grown up others of
a more tender and budding age fully engrossed by a merry game and a
profusion of wooden horses penny trumpets and tattered dolls about
the floor showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings who having
frolicked through a happy day had been carried off to slumber through a
peaceful night

while the mutual greetings were going on between young bracebridge and
his relatives i had time to scan the apartment i have called it a hall
for so it had certainly been in old times and the squire had evidently
endeavored to restore it to something of its primitive state over
the heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior
in armor standing by a white horse and on the opposite wall hung a
helmet buckler and lance at one end an enormous pair of antlers were
inserted in the wall the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend
hats whips and spurs and in the corners of the apartment were
fowling-pieces fishing-rods and other sporting implements the
furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days though some
articles of modern convenience had been added and the oaken floor had
been carpeted so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlor and
hall

the grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace to
make way for a fire of wood in the midst of which was an enormous log
glowing and blazing and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat
this i understood was the yule-clog which the squire was particular
in having brought in and illumined on a christmas eve according to
ancient custom


 the yule-clog is a great log of wood sometimes the root
 of a tree brought into the house with great ceremony on
 christmas eve laid in the fireplace and lighted with the
 brand of last year's clog while it lasted there was great
 drinking singing and telling of tales sometimes it was
 accompanied by christmas candles but in the cottages the
 only light was from the ruddy blaze of the great wood fire
 the yule-clog was to burn all night if it went out it was
 considered a sign of ill luck

herrick mentions it in one of his songs

 come bring with a noise
 my metric merrie boys
 the christmas log to the firing
 while my good dame she
 bids ye all be free
 and drink to your hearts desiring

the yule-clog is still burnt in many farm-houses and kitchens in
england particularly in the north and there are several superstitions
connected with it among the peasantry if a squinting person come to the
house while it is burning or a person barefooted it is considered an
ill omen the brand remaining from the yule-clog is carefully put away
to light the next year's christmas fire


it was really delightful to see the old squire seated in his hereditary
elbow-chair by the hospitable fireside of his ancestors and looking
around him like the sun of a system beaming warmth and gladness to
every heart even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet as he
lazily shifted his position and yawned would look fondly up in his
master's face wag his tail against the floor and stretch himself again
to sleep confident of kindness and protection there is an emanation
from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is
immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease i had not
been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy old
cavalier before i found myself as much at home as if i had been one of
the family

supper was announced shortly after our arrival it was served up in a
spacious oaken chamber the panels of which shone with wax and around
which were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy
besides the accustomed lights two great wax tapers called christmas
candles wreathed with greens were placed on a highly polished beaufet
among the family plate the table was abundantly spread with substantial
fare but the squire made his supper of frumenty a dish made of wheat
cakes boiled in milk with rich spices being a standing dish in old
times for christmas eve i was happy to find my old friend minced pie
in the retinue of the feast and finding him to be perfectly orthodox
and that i need not be ashamed of my predilection i greeted him with
all the warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel
acquaintance

the mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humors of an
eccentric personage whom mr bracebridge always addressed with the
quaint appellation of master simon he was a tight brisk little man
with the air of an arrant old bachelor his nose was shaped like the
bill of a parrot his face slightly pitted with the small-pox with a
dry perpetual bloom on it like a frostbitten leaf in autumn he had an
eye of great quickness and vivacity with a drollery and lurking waggery
of expression that was irresistible he was evidently the wit of the
family dealing very much in sly jokes and innuendoes with the ladies
and making infinite merriment by harping upon old themes which
unfortunately my ignorance of the family chronicles did not permit
me to enjoy it seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep
a young girl next to him in a continual agony of stifled laughter in
spite of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother who sat opposite
indeed he was the idol of the younger part of the company who laughed
at everything he said or did and at every turn of his countenance
i could not wonder at it for he must have been a miracle of
accomplishments in their eyes he could imitate punch and judy make
an old woman of his hand with the assistance of a burnt cork and
pocket-handkerchief and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature
that the young folks were ready to die with laughing

i was let briefly into his history by frank bracebridge he was an old
bachelor of a small independent income which by careful management was
sufficient for all his wants he revolved through the family system
like a vagrant comet in its orbit sometimes visiting one branch and
sometimes another quite remote as is often the case with gentlemen of
extensive connections and small fortunes in england he had a chirping
buoyant disposition always enjoying the present moment and his
frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those
rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so
uncharitably charged he was a complete family chronicle being versed
in the genealogy history and intermarriages of the whole house of
bracebridge which made him a great favorite with the old folks he was
a beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters among whom
he was habitually considered rather a young fellow and he was master
of the revels among the children so that there was not a more popular
being in the sphere in which he moved than mr simon bracebridge of
late years he had resided almost entirely with the squire to whom he
had become a factotum and whom he particularly delighted by jumping
with his humor in respect to old times and by having a scrap of an
old song to suit every occasion we had presently a specimen of his
last-mentioned talent for no sooner was supper removed and spiced wines
and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced than master simon
was called on for a good old christmas song he bethought himself for a
moment and then with a sparkle of the eye and a voice that was by no
means bad excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto like the
notes of a split reed he quavered forth a quaint old ditty

 now christmas is come
 let us beat up the drum
 and call all our neighbors together
 and when they appear
 let us make them such cheer
 as will keep out the wind and the weather c

the supper had disposed every one to gayety and an old harper was
summoned from the servants hall where he had been strumming all the
evening and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the
squire's home-brewed he was a kind of hanger-on i was told of the
establishment and though ostensibly a resident of the village was
oftener to be found in the squire's kitchen than his own home the old
gentleman being fond of the sound of harp in hall

the dance like most dances after supper was a merry one some of the
older folks joined in it and the squire himself figured down several
couple with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every
christmas for nearly half a century master simon who seemed to be a
kind of connecting link between the old times and the new and to
be withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments
evidently piqued himself on his dancing and was endeavoring to gain
credit by the heel and toe rigadoon and other graces of the ancient
school but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping girl
from boarding-school who by her wild vivacity kept him continually on
the stretch and defeated all his sober attempts at elegance such are
the ill-sorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately
prone

the young oxonian on the contrary had led out one of his maiden aunts
on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity he
was full of practical jokes and his delight was to tease his aunts and
cousins yet like all madcap youngsters he was a universal favorite
among the women the most interesting couple in the dance was the
young officer and a ward of the squire's a beautiful blushing girl of
seventeen from several shy glances which i had noticed in the course of
the evening i suspected there was a little kindness growing up between
them and indeed the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a
romantic girl he was tall slender and handsome and like most
young british officers of late years had picked up various small
accomplishments on the continent he could talk french and italian draw
landscapes sing very tolerably dance divinely but above all he had
been wounded at waterloo what girl of seventeen well read in poetry
and romance could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection

the moment the dance was over he caught up a guitar and lolling
against the old marble fireplace in an attitude which i am half inclined
to suspect was studied began the little french air of the troubadour
the squire however exclaimed against having anything on christmas eve
but good old english upon which the young minstrel casting up his eye
for a moment as if in an effort of memory struck into another strain
and with a charming air of gallantry gave herrick's night-piece to
julia

 her eyes the glow-worm lend thee
 the shooting stars attend thee
 and the elves also
 whose little eyes glow
 like the sparks of fire befriend thee

 no will-o-the-wisp mislight thee
 nor snake nor slow-worm bite thee
 but on thy way
 not making a stay
 since ghost there is none to affright thee

 then let not the dark thee cumber
 what though the moon does slumber
 the stars of the night
 will lend thee their light
 like tapers clear without number

 then julia let me woo thee
 thus thus to come unto me
 and when i shall meet
 thy silvery feet
 my soul i'll pour into thee

the song might or might not have been intended in compliment to the
fair julia for so i found his partner was called she however was
certainly unconscious of any such application for she never looked
at the singer but kept her eyes cast upon the floor her face was
suffused it is true with a beautiful blush and there was a gentle
heaving of the bosom but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise
of the dance indeed so great was her indifference that she amused
herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers
and by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the
floor

the party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of
shaking hands as i passed through the hall on my way to my chamber the
dying embers of the yule-clog still sent forth a dusky glow and had it
not been the season when no spirit dares stir abroad i should have
been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight and peep whether the
fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth

my chamber was in the old part of the mansion the ponderous furniture
of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants the room
was panelled with cornices of heavy carved work in which flowers and
grotesque faces were strangely intermingled and a row of black-looking
portraits stared mournfully at me from the walls the bed was of rich
though faded damask with a lofty tester and stood in a niche opposite
a bow window i had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed
to break forth in the air just below the window i listened and found
it proceeded from a band which i concluded to be the waits from some
neighboring village they went round the house playing under the
windows i drew aside the curtains to hear them more distinctly
the moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement partially
lighting up the antiquated apartment the sounds as they receded
became more soft and aerial and seemed to accord with the quiet and
moonlight i listened and listened they became more and more tender and
remote and as they gradually died away my head sunk upon the pillow
and i fell asleep




christmas day

 dark and dull night flie hence away
 and give the honor to this day
 that sees december turn'd to may
 
 why does the chilling winter's morne
 smile like a field beset with corn
 or smell like to a meade new-shorne
 thus on the sudden come and see
 the cause why things thus fragrant be
 herrick

when i woke the next morning it seemed as if all the events of the
preceding evening had been a dream and nothing but the identity of the
ancient chamber convinced me of their reality while i lay musing on my
pillow i heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door
and a whispering consultation presently a choir of small voices chanted
forth an old christmas carol the burden of which was 

 rejoice our saviour he was born
 on christmas day in the morning

i rose softly slipt on my clothes opened the door suddenly and beheld
one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could
imagine it consisted of a boy and two girls the eldest not more than
six and lovely as seraphs they were going the rounds of the house and
singing at every chamber door but my sudden appearance frightened them
into mute bashfulness they remained for a moment playing on their lips
with their fingers and now and then stealing a shy glance from under
their eyebrows until as if by one impulse they scampered away and as
they turned an angle of the gallery i heard them laughing in triumph at
their escape

everything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this
stronghold of old-fashioned hospitality the window of my chamber looked
out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape there was
a sloping lawn a fine stream winding at the foot of it and a tract of
park beyond with noble clumps of trees and herds of deer at a distance
was a neat hamlet with the smoke from the cottage chimneys hanging over
it and a church with its dark spire in strong relief against the clear
cold sky the house was surrounded with evergreens according to the
english custom which would have given almost an appearance of summer
but the morning was extremely frosty the light vapor of the preceding
evening had been precipitated by the cold and covered all the trees and
every blade of grass with its fine crystalizations the rays of a bright
morning sun had a dazzling effect among the glittering foliage a robin
perched upon the top of a mountain-ash that hung its clusters of red
berries just before my window was basking himself in the sunshine
and piping a few querulous notes and a peacock was displaying all
the glories of his train and strutting with the pride and gravity of a
spanish grandee on the terrace walk below

i had scarcely dressed myself when a servant appeared to invite me to
family prayers he showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing
of the house where i found the principal part of the family already
assembled in a kind of gallery furnished with cushions hassocks and
large prayer-books the servants were seated on benches below the old
gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery and master
simon acted as clerk and made the responses and i must do him the
justice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum

the service was followed by a christmas carol which mr bracebridge
himself had constructed from a poem of his favorite author herrick and
it had been adapted to an old church melody by master simon as there
were several good voices among the household the effect was extremely
pleasing but i was particularly gratified by the exaltation of heart
and sudden sally of grateful feeling with which the worthy squire
delivered one stanza his eye glistening and his voice rambling out of
all the bounds of time and tune

 tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth
 with guiltless mirth
 and givest me wassaile bowles to drink
 spiced to the brink
 lord tis thy plenty-dropping hand
 that soiles my land
 and giv'st me for my bushell sowne
 twice ten for one

i afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every
sunday and saint's day throughout the year either by mr bracebridge or
by some member of the family it was once almost universally the case
at the seats of the nobility and gentry of england and it is much to
be regretted that the custom is falling into neglect for the dullest
observer must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those
households where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship
in the morning gives as it were the keynote to every temper for the
day and attunes every spirit to harmony

our breakfast consisted of what the squire denominated true old english
fare he indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts
of tea and toast which he censured as among the causes of modern
effeminacy and weak nerves and the decline of old english heartiness
and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his
guests yet there was a brave display of cold meats wine and ale on
the sideboard

after breakfast i walked about the grounds with frank bracebridge
and master simon or mr simon as he was called by everybody but the
squire we were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs that seemed
loungers about the establishment from the frisking spaniel to the
steady old stag-hound the last of which was of a race that had been
in the family time out of mind they were all obedient to a dog-whistle
which hung to master simon's buttonhole and in the midst of their
gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried
in his hand

the old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine
than by pale moonlight and i could not but feel the force of the
squire's idea that the formal terraces heavily moulded balustrades and
clipped yew trees carried with them an air of proud aristocracy there
appeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place and i was
making some remarks upon what i termed a flock of them that were basking
under a sunny wall when i was gently corrected in my phraseology
by master simon who told me that according to the most ancient and
approved treatise on hunting i must say a muster of peacocks in the
same way added he with a slight air of pedantry we say a flight
of doves or swallows a bevy of quails a herd of deer of wrens or
cranes a skulk of foxes or a building of rooks he went on to inform
me that according to sir anthony fitzherbert we ought to ascribe to
this bird both understanding and glory for being praised he will
presently set up his tail chiefly against the sun to the intent you
may the better behold the beauty thereof but at the fall of the leaf
when his tail falleth he will mourn and hide himself in corners till
his tail come again as it was

i could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so
whimsical a subject but i found that the peacocks were birds of some
consequence at the hall for frank bracebridge informed me that they
were great favorites with his father who was extremely careful to keep
up the breed partly because they belonged to chivalry and were in
great request at the stately banquets of the olden time and partly
because they had a pomp and magnificence about them highly becoming an
old family mansion nothing he was accustomed to say had an air of
greater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone
balustrade

master simon had now to hurry off having an appointment at the parish
church with the village choristers who were to perform some music of
his selection there was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful
flow of animal spirits of the little man and i confess i had been
somewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly
were not in the range of every-day reading i mentioned this last
circumstance to frank bracebridge who told me with a smile that master
simon's whole stock of erudition was confined to some half a dozen old
authors which the squire had put into his hands and which he read over
and over whenever he had a studious fit as he sometimes had on a
rainy day or a long winter evening sir anthony fitzherbert's book of
husbandry markham's country contentments the tretyse of hunting by
sir thomas cockayne knight isaac walton's angler and two or three
more such ancient worthies of the pen were his standard authorities
and like all men who know but a few books he looked up to them with a
kind of idolatry and quoted them on all occasions as to his songs
they were chiefly picked out of old books in the squire's library and
adapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last
century his practical application of scraps of literature however had
caused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of book-knowledge by all the
grooms huntsmen and small sportsmen of the neighborhood

while we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell
and i was told that the squire was a little particular in having his
household at church on a christmas morning considering it a day of
pouring out of thanks and rejoicing for as old tusser observed 

 at christmas be merry and thankful withal
 and feast thy poor neighbors the great with the small

if you are disposed to go to church said frank bracebridge i can
promise you a specimen of my cousin simon's musical achievements as the
church is destitute of an organ he has formed a band from the village
amateurs and established a musical club for their improvement he has
also sorted a choir as he sorted my father's pack of hounds according
to the directions of jervaise markham in his country contentments for
the bass he has sought out all the deep solemn mouths and for the
tenor the loud-ringing mouths among the country bumpkins and for
sweet-mouths he has culled-with curious taste among the prettiest
lasses in the neighborhood though these last he affirms are the most
difficult to keep in tune your pretty female singer being exceedingly
wayward and capricious and very liable to accident

as the morning though frosty was remarkably fine and clear the most
of the family walked to the church which was a very old building of
gray stone and stood near a village about half a mile from the park
gate adjoining it was a low snug parsonage which seemed coeval with the
church the front of it was perfectly matted with a yew tree that had
been trained against its walls through the dense foliage of which
apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique
lattices as we passed this sheltered nest the parson issued forth and
preceded us

i had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor such as is often
found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron's table but i
was disappointed the parson was a little meagre black-looking man
with a grizzled wig that was too wide and stood off from each ear so
that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it like a dried filbert
in its shell he wore a rusty coat with great skirts and pockets that
would have held the church bible and prayer-book and his small legs
seemed still smaller from being planted in large shoes decorated with
enormous buckles

i was informed by frank bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of
his father's at oxford and had received this living shortly after the
latter had come to his estate he was a complete black-letter hunter
and would scarcely read a work printed in the roman character the
editions of caxton and wynkyn de worde were his delight and he was
indefatigable in his researches after such old english writers as have
fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness in deference perhaps to
the notions of mr bracebridge he had made diligent investigations into
the festive rites and holiday customs of former times and had been as
zealous in the inquiry as if he had been a boon companion but it was
merely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament
follow up any track of study merely because it is denominated learning
indifferent to its intrinsic nature whether it be the illustration of
the wisdom or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity he had pored
over these old volumes so intensely that they seemed to have been
reflected into his countenance which if the face be indeed an index of
the mind might be compared to a title-page of black-letter

on reaching the church-porch we found the parson rebuking the
gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which
the church was decorated it was he observed an unholy plant profaned
by having been used by the druids in their mystic ceremonies and
though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of
halls and kitchens yet it had been deemed by the fathers of the church
as unhallowed and totally unfit for sacred purposes so tenacious was
he on this point that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great
part of the humble trophies of his taste before the parson would consent
to enter upon the service of the day

the interior of the church was venerable but simple on the walls were
several mural monuments of the bracebridges and just beside the altar
was a tomb of ancient workmanship on which lay the effigy of a warrior
in armor with his legs crossed a sign of his having been a crusader i
was told it was one of the family who had signalized himself in the holy
land and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall

during service master simon stood up in the pew and repeated the
responses very audibly evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion
punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school and a man of old
family connections i observed too that he turned over the leaves of a
folio prayer-book with something of a flourish possibly to show off an
enormous seal-ring which enriched one of his fingers and which had the
look of a family relic but he was evidently most solicitous about
the musical part of the service keeping his eye fixed intently on the
choir and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis

the orchestra was in a small gallery and presented a most whimsical
grouping of heads piled one above the other among which i particularly
noticed that of the village tailor a pale fellow with a retreating
forehead and chin who played on the clarinet and seemed to have blown
his face to a point and there was another a short pursy man stooping
and laboring at a bass-viol so as to show nothing but the top of a
round bald head like the egg of an ostrich there were two or three
pretty faces among the female singers to which the keen air of a frosty
morning had given a bright rosy tint but the gentlemen choristers had
evidently been chosen like old cremona fiddles more for tone than
looks and as several had to sing from the same book there were
clusterings of odd physiognomies not unlike those groups of cherubs we
sometimes see on country tombstones

the usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well the vocal
parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental and some
loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling
over a passage with prodigious celerity and clearing more bars than the
keenest fox-hunter to be in at the death but the great trial was an
anthem that had been prepared and arranged by master simon and on which
he had founded great expectation unluckily there was a blunder at the
very outset the musicians became flurried master simon was in a fever
everything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus
beginning now let us sing with one accord which seemed to be a
signal for parting company all became discord and confusion each
shifted for himself and got to the end as well or rather as soon as
he could excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles
bestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose who happened to stand
a little apart and being wrapped up in his own melody kept on a
quavering course wriggling his head ogling his book and winding all
up by a nasal solo of at least three bars duration

the parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies
of christmas and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day
of thanksgiving but of rejoicing supporting the correctness of his
opinions by the earliest usages of the church and enforcing them by the
authorities of theophilus of caesarea st cyprian st chrysostom st
augustine and a cloud more of saints and fathers from whom he made
copious quotations i was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity
of such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one
present seemed inclined to dispute but i soon found that the good man
had a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with having in the course
of his researches on the subject of christmas got completely embroiled
in the sectarian controversies of the revolution when the puritans made
such a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the church and poor old
christmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of parliament
the worthy parson lived but with times past and knew but little of the
present

shut up among worm-eaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated
little study the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the
day while the era of the revolution was mere modern history he forgot
that nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of
poor mince-pie throughout the land when plum porridge was denounced as
mere popery and roast beef as anti-christian and that christmas had
been brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of king charles
at the restoration he kindled into warmth with the ardor of his contest
and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat he had a
stubborn conflict with old prynne and two or three other forgotten
champions of the roundheads on the subject of christmas festivity
and concluded by urging his hearers in the most solemn and affecting
manner to stand to the traditional customs of their fathers and feast
and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the church


 from the flying eagle a small gazette published
 december the house spent much time this day about
 the business of the navy for settling the affairs at sea
 and before they rose were presented with a terrible
 remonstrance against christmas day grounded upon divine
 scriptures cor v i cor xv and in honor of
 the lord's day grounded upon these scriptures john xx i
 rev i psalms cxviii lev xxiii mark xv
 psalms lxxxiv in which christmas is called anti-
 christ's masse and those masse-mongers and papists who
 observe it etc in consequence of which parliament spent
 some time in consultation about the abolition of christmas
 day passed orders to that effect and resolved to sit on
 the following day which was commonly called christmas day


i have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate
effects for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and
all possessed with the gayety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their
pastor the elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard greeting
and shaking hands and the children ran about crying ule ule and
repeating some uncouth rhymes which the parson who had joined us
informed me had been handed down from days of yore the villagers doffed
their hats to the squire as he passed giving him the good wishes of the
season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity and were invited by
him to the hall to take something to keep out the cold of the weather
and i heard blessings uttered by several of the poor which convinced
me that in the midst of his enjoyments the worthy old cavalier had not
forgotten the true christmas virtue of charity


 ule ule
 three puddings in a pule
 crack nuts and cry ule


on our way homeward his heart seemed overflowed with generous and happy
feelings as we passed over a rising ground which commanded something
of a prospect the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our
ears the squire paused for a few moments and looked around with an
air of inexpressible benignity the beauty of the day was of itself
sufficient to inspire philanthropy notwithstanding the frostiness of
the morning the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient
power to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern
declivity and to bring out the living green which adorns an english
landscape even in mid-winter large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted
with the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows every
sheltered bank on which the broad rays rested yielded its silver rill of
cold and limpid water glittering through the dripping grass and sent
up slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just
above the surface of the earth there was something truly cheering in
this triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter
it was as the squire observed an emblem of christmas hospitality
breaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness and thawing
every heart into a flow he pointed with pleasure to the indications of
good cheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farm-houses and
low thatched cottages i love said he to see this day well kept
by rich and poor it is a great thing to have one day in the year
at least when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go and of
having as it were the world all thrown open to you and i am almost
disposed to join with poor robin in his malediction on every churlish
enemy to this honest festival

 those who at christmas do repine
 and would fain hence dispatch him
 may they with old duke humphry dine
 or else may squire ketch catch'em

the squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and
amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower
orders and countenanced by the higher when the old halls of castles and
manor-houses were thrown open at daylight when the tables were covered
with brawn and beef and humming ale when the harp and the carol
resounded all day long and when rich and poor were alike welcome to
enter and make merry our old games and local customs said he had
a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home and the promotion
of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord they made the times
merrier and kinder and better and i can truly say with one of our old
poets

 i like them well the curious preciseness
 and all-pretended gravity of those
 that seek to banish hence these harmless sports
 have thrust away much ancient honesty

the nation continued he is altered we have almost lost our
simple true-hearted peasantry they have broken asunder from the higher
classes and seem to think their interests are separate they have
become too knowing and begin to read newspapers listen to ale-house
politicians and talk of reform i think one mode to keep them in
good-humor in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to
pass more time on their estates mingle more among the country-people
and set the merry old english games going again


 an english gentleman at the opening of the great day 
 ie on christmas day in the morning had all his tenants
 and neighbors enter his hall by daybreak the strong beer
 was broached and the black-jacks went plentifully about
 with toast sugar and nutmeg and good cheshire cheese the
 hackin the great sausage must be boiled by daybreak or
 else two young men must take the maiden ie the cook by
 the arms and run her round the market-place till she is
 shamed of her laziness round about our sea-coal fire


such was the good squire's project for mitigating public discontent
and indeed he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice and
a few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old
style the country-people however did not understand how to play their
parts in the scene of hospitality many uncouth circumstances occurred
the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country and more
beggars drawn into the neighborhood in one week than the parish officers
could get rid of in a year since then he had contented himself with
inviting the decent part of the neighboring peasantry to call at the
hall on christmas day and with distributing beef and bread and ale
among the poor that they might make merry in their own dwellings

we had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a
distance a band of country lads without coats their shirt-sleeves
fancifully tied with ribbons their hats decorated with greens and
clubs in their hands was seen advancing up the avenue followed by a
large number of villagers and peasantry they stopped before the hall
door where the music struck up a peculiar air and the lads performed
a curious and intricate dance advancing retreating and striking their
clubs together keeping exact time to the music while one whimsically
crowned with a fox's skin the tail of which flaunted down his back
kept capering round the skirts of the dance and rattling a christmas box
with many antic gesticulations

the squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and
delight and gave me a full account of its origin which he traced to
the times when the romans held possession of the island plainly proving
that this was a lineal descendant of the sword dance of the ancients
it was now he said nearly extinct but he had accidentally met
with traces of it in the neighborhood and had encouraged its revival
though to tell the truth it was too apt to be followed up by the rough
cudgel play and broken heads in the evening

after the dance was concluded the whole party was entertained with brawn
and beef and stout home-brewed the squire himself mingled among the
rustics and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and
regard it is true i perceived two or three of the younger peasants as
they were raising their tankards to their mouths when the squire's
back was turned making something of a grimace and giving each other the
wink but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces and were
exceedingly demure with master simon however they all seemed more
at their ease his varied occupations and amusements had made him well
known throughout the neighborhood he was a visitor at every farmhouse
and cottage gossiped with the farmers and their wives romped with
their daughters and like that type of a vagrant bachelor the
humblebee tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country
round

the bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and
affability there is something genuine and affectionate in the gayety
of the lower orders when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of
those above them the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth
and a kind word or a small pleasantry frankly uttered by a patron
gladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine when the
squire had retired the merriment increased and there was much joking
and laughter particularly between master simon and a hale ruddy-faced
white-headed farmer who appeared to be the wit of the village for i
observed all his companions to wait with open months for his retorts
and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand
them

the whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment as i passed to my
room to dress for dinner i heard the sound of music in a small court
and looking through a window that commanded it i perceived a band
of wandering musicians with pandean pipes and tambourine a pretty
coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad while
several of the other servants were looking on in the midst of her sport
the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window and coloring up
ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion




the christmas dinner

 lo now is come our joyful'st feast
 let every man be jolly
 eache roome with yvie leaves is drest
 and every post with holly
 now all our neighbours chimneys smoke
 and christmas blocks are burning
 their ovens they with bak't meats choke
 and all their spits are turning
 without the door let sorrow lie
 and if for cold it hap to die
 wee'l bury t in a christmas pye
 and evermore be merry
 withers juvenilia

i had finished my toilet and was loitering with frank bracebridge in
the library when we heard a distant thwacking sound which he informed
me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner the squire kept up old
customs in kitchen as well as hall and the rolling-pin struck upon the
dresser by the cook summoned the servants to carry in the meats

 just in this nick the cook knock'd thrice
 and all the waiters in a trice
 his summons did obey
 each serving-man with dish in hand
 march'd boldly up like our train-band
 presented and away


 sir john suckling


the dinner was served up in the great hall where the squire always held
his christmas banquet a blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped
on to warm the spacious apartment and the flame went sparkling and
wreathing up the wide-mouthed chimney the great picture of the crusader
and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the
occasion and holly and ivy had like-wise been wreathed round the helmet
and weapons on the opposite wall which i understood were the arms of
the same warrior i must own by the by i had strong doubts about
the authenticity of the painting and armor as having belonged to the
crusader they certainly having the stamp of more recent days but i was
told that the painting had been so considered time out of mind and that
as to the armor it had been found in a lumber-room and elevated to its
present situation by the squire who at once determined it to be the
armor of the family hero and as he was absolute authority on all
such subjects in his own household the matter had passed into current
acceptation a sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy
on which was a display of plate that might have vied at least in
variety with belshazzar's parade of the vessels of the temple
flagons cans cups beakers goblets basins and ewers the gorgeous
utensils of good companionship that had gradually accumulated through
many generations of jovial housekeepers before these stood the two yule
candles beaming like two stars of the first magnitude other lights
were distributed in branches and the whole array glittered like a
firmament of silver

we were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy
the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace and
twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody never
did christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of
countenances those who were not handsome were at least happy and
happiness is a rare improver of your hard-favored visage i always
consider an old english family as well worth studying as a collection of
holbein's portraits or albert durer's prints there is much antiquarian
lore to be acquired much knowledge of the physiognomies of former
times perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those
rows of old family portraits with which the mansions of this country
are stocked certain it is that the quaint features of antiquity are
often most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines and i have
traced an old family nose through a whole picture-gallery legitimately
handed down from generation to generation almost from the time of the
conquest something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company
around me many of their faces had evidently originated in a gothic
age and been merely copied by succeeding generations and there was one
little girl in particular of staid demeanor with a high roman nose
and an antique vinegar aspect who was a great favorite of the squire's
being as he said a bracebridge all over and the very counterpart of
one of his ancestors who figured in the court of henry viii

the parson said grace which was not a short familiar one such as is
commonly addressed to the deity in these unceremonious days but a long
courtly well-worded one of the ancient school there was now a pause
as if something was expected when suddenly the butler entered the hall
with some degree of bustle he was attended by a servant on each side
with a large wax-light and bore a silver dish on which was an enormous
pig's head decorated with rosemary with a lemon in its mouth which was
placed with great formality at the head of the table the moment this
pageant made its appearance the harper struck up a flourish at the
conclusion of which the young oxonian on receiving a hint from the
squire gave with an air of the most comic gravity an old carol the
first verse of which was as follows

 caput apri defero
 reddens laudes domino
 the boar's head in hand bring i
 with garlands gay and rosemary
 i pray you all synge merily
 qui estis in convivio

though prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities from
being apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host yet i confess the
parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me
until i gathered from the conversation of the squire and the parson that
it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boar's head a dish
formerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and
song at great tables on christmas day i like the old custom said the
squire not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself
but because it was observed at the college at oxford at which i was
educated when i hear the old song chanted it brings to mind the time
when i was young and gamesome and the noble old college hall and my
fellow-students loitering about in their black gowns many of whom poor
lads are now in their graves

the parson however whose mind was not haunted by such associations
and who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment
objected to the oxonian's version of the carol which he affirmed
was different from that sung at college he went on with the dry
perseverance of a commentator to give the college reading accompanied
by sundry annotations addressing himself at first to the company at
large but finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk and
other objects he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished
until he concluded his remarks in an under voice to a fat-headed old
gentleman next him who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge
plateful of turkey


 the old ceremony of serving up the boar's head on
 christmas day is still observed in the hall of queen's
 college oxford i was favored by the parson with a copy of
 the carol as now sung and as it may be acceptable to such
 of my readers as are curious in these grave and learned
 matters i give it entire

 the boar's head in hand bear i
 bedeck'd with bays and rosemary
 and i pray you my masters be merry
 quot estis in convivio
 caput apri defero
 reddens laudes domino

 the boar's head as i understand
 is the rarest dish in all this land
 which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
 let us servire cantico
 caput apri defero etc

 our steward hath provided this
 in honor of the king of bliss
 which on this day to be served is
 in reginensi atrio
 caput apri defero etc etc etc


the table was literally loaded with good cheer and presented an
epitome of country abundance in this season of overflowing larders
a distinguished post was allotted to ancient sirloin as mine host
termed it being as he added the standard of old english hospitality
and a joint of goodly presence and full of expectation there were
several dishes quaintly decorated and which had evidently something
traditional in their embellishments but about which as i did not like
to appear overcurious i asked no questions

i could not however but notice a pie magnificently decorated with
peacock's feathers in imitation of the tail of that bird which
overshadowed a considerable tract of the table this the squire
confessed with some little hesitation was a pheasant pie though a
peacock pie was certainly the most authentical but there had been such
a mortality among the peacocks this season that he could not prevail
upon himself to have one killed


 the peacock was anciently in great demand for stately
 entertainments sometimes it was made into a pie at one end
 of which the head appeared above the crust in all its
 plumage with the beak richly gilt at the other end the
 tail was displayed such pies were served up at the solemn
 banquets of chivalry when knights-errant pledged themselves
 to undertake any perilous enterprise whence came the
 ancient oath used by justice shallow by cock and pie

the peacock was also an important dish for the christmas feast and
massinger in his city madam gives some idea of the extravagance
with which this as well as other dishes was prepared for the gorgeous
revels of the olden times

 men may talk of country christmasses
 their thirty pound butter'd eggs their pies of carps tongues
 their pheasants drench'd with ambergris the carcases of three
 fat wethers bruised for gravy to make sauce for a single peacock


it would be tedious perhaps to my wiser readers who may not have
that foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things to which i am a
little given were i to mention the other makeshifts or this worthy old
humorist by which he was endeavoring to follow up though at humble
distance the quaint customs of antiquity i was pleased however to
see the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives who
indeed entered readily into the full spirit of them and seemed all
well versed in their parts having doubtless been present at many a
rehearsal i was amused too at the air of profound gravity with which
the butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them however
eccentric they had an old-fashioned look having for the most part
been brought up in the household and grown into keeping with the
antiquated mansion and the humors of its lord and most probably looked
upon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of honorable
housekeeping

when the cloth was removed the butler brought in a huge silver vessel
of rare and curious workmanship which he placed before the squire
its appearance was hailed with acclamation being the wassail bowl so
renowned in christmas festivity the contents had been prepared by the
squire himself for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which
he particularly prided himself alleging that it was too abstruse and
complex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant it was a potation
indeed that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him being
composed of the richest and raciest wines highly spiced and sweetened
with roasted apples bobbing about the surface


 the wassail bowl was sometimes composed of ale instead of
 wine with nutmeg sugar toast ginger and roasted crabs
 in this way the nut-brown beverage is still prepared in some
 old families and round the hearths of substantial farmers at
 christmas it is also called lamb's wool and is celebrated
 by herrick in his twelfth night

 next crowne the bowle full
 with gentle lamb's wool
 add sugar nutmeg and ginger
 with store of ale too
 and thus ye must doe
 to make the wassaile a swinger


the old gentleman's whole countenance beamed with a serene look of
indwelling delight as he stirred this mighty bowl having raised it to
his lips with a hearty wish of a merry christmas to all present he
sent it brimming round the board for every one to follow his example
according to the primitive style pronouncing it the ancient fountain
of good feeling where all hearts met together


 the custom of drinking out of the same cup gave place to
 each having his cup when the steward came to the doore with
 the wassel he was to cry three times wassel wassel
 wassel and then the chappell chaplain was to answer with
 a song archaeologia


there was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of christmas
joviality circulated and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies when it
reached master simon he raised it in both hands and with the air of a
boon companion struck up an old wassail chanson

 the brown bowle
 the merry brown bowle
 as it goes round-about-a
 fill
 still
 let the world say what it will
 and drink your fill all out-a

 the deep canne
 the merry deep canne
 as thou dost freely quaff-a
 sing
 fling
 be as merry as a king
 and sound a lusty laugh-a


 from poor robin's almanack


much of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics to
which i was a stranger there was however a great deal of rallying of
master simon about some gay widow with whom he was accused of having
a flirtation this attack was commenced by the ladies but it was
continued throughout the dinner by the fat-headed old gentleman next
the parson with the persevering assiduity of a slow hound being one of
those long-winded jokers who though rather dull at starting game are
unrivalled for their talents in hunting it down at every pause in the
general conversation he renewed his bantering in pretty much the same
terms winking hard at me with both eyes whenever he gave master simon
what he considered a home thrust the latter indeed seemed fond of
being teased on the subject as old bachelors are apt to be and he took
occasion to inform me in an undertone that the lady in question was a
prodigiously fine woman and drove her own curricle

the dinner-time passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity and
though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene
of broader rout and revel yet i doubt whether it ever witnessed more
honest and genuine enjoyment how easy it is for one benevolent being to
diffuse pleasure around him and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of
gladness making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles the
joyous disposition of the worthy squire was perfectly contagious he was
happy himself and disposed to make all the world happy and the little
eccentricities of his humor did but season in a manner the sweetness
of his philanthropy

when the ladies had retired the conversation as usual became still
more animated many good things were broached which had been thought
of during dinner but which would not exactly do for a lady's ear and
though i cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered yet
i have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less
laughter wit after all is a mighty tart pungent ingredient and much
too acid for some stomachs but honest good-humor is the oil and wine
of a merry meeting and there is no jovial companionship equal to that
where the jokes are rather small and the laughter abundant

the squire told several long stories of early college pranks and
adventures in some of which the parson had been a sharer though in
looking at the latter it required some effort of imagination to figure
such a little dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap
gambol indeed the two college chums presented pictures of what men
may be made by their different lots in life the squire had left the
university to live lustily on his paternal domains in the vigorous
enjoyment of prosperity and sunshine and had flourished on to a hearty
and florid old age whilst the poor parson on the contrary had dried
and withered away among dusty tomes in the silence and shadows of his
study still there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire
feebly glimmering in the bottom of his soul and as the squire hinted
at a sly story of the parson and a pretty milkmaid whom they once met
on the banks of the isis the old gentleman made an alphabet of faces
which as far as i could decipher his physiognomy i verily believe was
indicative of laughter indeed i have rarely met with an old gentleman
that took absolute offence at the imputed gallantries of his youth

i found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of
sober judgment the company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew
duller master simon was in as chirping a humor as a grasshopper filled
with dew his old songs grew of a warmer complexion and he began to
talk maudlin about the widow he even gave a long song about the wooing
of a widow which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent
black-letter work entitled cupid's solicitor for love containing store
of good advice for bachelors and which he promised to lend me the
first verse was to effect

 he that will woo a widow must not dally
 he must make hay while the sun doth shine
 he must not stand with her shall i shall i
 but boldly say widow thou must be mine

this song inspired the fat-headed old gentleman who made several
attempts to tell a rather broad story out of joe miller that was pat to
the purpose but he always stuck in the middle everybody recollecting
the latter part excepting himself the parson too began to show the
effects of good cheer having gradually settled down into a doze and his
wig sitting most suspiciously on one side just at this juncture we were
summoned to the drawing room and i suspect at the private instigation
of mine host whose joviality seemed always tempered with a proper love
of decorum

after the dinner-table was removed the hall was given up to the younger
members of the family who prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the
oxonian and master simon made its old walls ring with their merriment
as they played at romping games i delight in witnessing the gambols of
children and particularly at this happy holiday season and could not
help stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of
laughter i found them at the game of blindman's-buff master simon who
was the leader of their revels and seemed on all occasions to fulfill
the office of that ancient potentate the lord of misrule was blinded
in the midst of the hall the little beings were as busy about him as
the mock fairies about falstaff pinching him plucking at the skirts of
his coat and tickling him with straws one fine blue-eyed girl of about
thirteen with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion her frolic
face in a glow her frock half torn off her shoulders a complete
picture of a romp was the chief tormentor and from the slyness with
which master simon avoided the smaller game and hemmed this wild little
nymph in corners and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs
i suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was
convenient


 at christmasse there was in the kinges house wheresoever
 hee was lodged a lorde of misrule or mayster of merie
 disportes and the like had ye in the house of every
 nobleman of honor or good worshipper were he spirituall or
 temporall stow


when i returned to the drawing-room i found the company seated round the
fire listening to the parson who was deeply ensconced in a high-backed
oaken chair the work of some cunning artificer of yore which had been
brought from the library for his particular accommodation from this
venerable piece of furniture with which his shadowy figure and dark
weazen face so admirably accorded he was dealing out strange accounts
of the popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country
with which he had become acquainted in the course of his antiquarian
researches i am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was
himself somewhat tinctured with superstition as men are very apt to
be who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the
country and pore over black-letter tracts so often filled with the
marvelous and supernatural he gave us several anecdotes of the fancies
of the neighboring peasantry concerning the effigy of the crusader which
lay on the tomb by the church altar as it was the only monument of
the kind in that part of the country it had always been regarded with
feelings of superstition by the good wives of the village it was said
to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy
nights particularly when it thundered and one old woman whose cottage
bordered on the churchyard had seen it through the windows of the
church when the moon shone slowly pacing up and down the aisles
it was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the
deceased or some treasure hidden which kept the spirit in a state of
trouble and restlessness some talked of gold and jewels buried in the
tomb over which the spectre kept watch and there was a story current
of a sexton in old times who endeavored to break his way to the coffin
at night but just as he reached it received a violent blow from
the marble hand of the effigy which stretched him senseless on the
pavement these tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier
among the rustics yet when night came on there were many of the
stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath
that led across the churchyard

from these and other anecdotes that followed the crusader appeared to be
the favorite hero of ghost-stories throughout the vicinity his picture
which hung up in the hall was thought by the servants to have something
supernatural about it for they remarked that in whatever part of the
hall you went the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you the old
porter's wife too at the lodge who had been born and brought up in
the family and was a great gossip among the maid-servants affirmed
that in her young days she had often heard say that on midsummer eve
when it was well known all kinds of ghosts goblins and fairies become
visible and walk abroad the crusader used to mount his horse come down
from his picture ride about the house down the avenue and so to the
church to visit the tomb on which occasion the church-door most civilly
swung open of itself not that he needed it for he rode through closed
gates and even stone walls and had been seen by one of the dairymaids
to pass between two bars of the great park gate making himself as thin
as a sheet of paper

all these superstitions i found had been very much countenanced by the
squire who though not superstitious himself was very fond of seeing
others so he listened to every goblin tale of the neighboring gossips
with infinite gravity and held the porter's wife in high favor on
account of her talent for the marvellous he was himself a great reader
of old legends and romances and often lamented that he could not
believe in them for a superstitious person he thought must live in a
kind of fairy-land

whilst we were all attention to the parson's stories our ears were
suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall in
which were mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy with the
uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter the door suddenly flew
open and a train came trooping into the room that might almost
have been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of faery that
indefatigable spirit master simon in the faithful discharge of his
duties as lord of misrule had conceived the idea of a christmas mummery
or masking and having called in to his assistance the oxonian and the
young officer who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion
romping and merriment they had carried it into instant effect the old
housekeeper had been consulted the antique clothespresses and wardrobes
rummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the
light for several generations the younger part of the company had been
privately convened from the parlor and hall and the whole had been
bedizened out into a burlesque imitation of an antique mask


 maskings or mummeries were favorite sports at christmas in
 old times and the wardrobes at halls and manor-houses were
 often laid under contribution to furnish dresses and
 fantastic disguisings i strongly suspect master simon to
 have taken the idea of his from ben jonson's masque of
 christmas


master simon led the van as ancient christmas quaintly apparelled in
a ruff a short cloak which had very much the aspect of one of the old
housekeeper's petticoats and a hat that might have served for a
village steeple and must indubitably have figured in the days of the
covenanters from under this his nose curved boldly forth flushed with
a frost-bitten bloom that seemed the very trophy of a december blast he
was accompanied by the blue-eyed romp dished up as dame mince pie
in the venerable magnificence of a faded brocade long stomacher peaked
hat and high-heeled shoes the young officer appeared as robin hood in
a sporting dress of kendal green and a foraging cap with a gold tassel

the costume to be sure did not bear testimony to deep research and
there was an evident eye to the picturesque natural to a young gallant
in the presence of his mistress the fair julia hung on his arm in a
pretty rustic dress as maid marian the rest of the train had been
metamorphosed in various ways the girls trussed up in the finery of the
ancient belles of the bracebridge line and the striplings bewhiskered
with burnt cork and gravely clad in broad skirts hanging sleeves
and full-bottomed wigs to represent the character of roast beef plum
pudding and other worthies celebrated in ancient maskings the whole
was under the control of the oxonian in the appropriate character of
misrule and i observed that he exercised rather a mischievous sway with
his wand over the smaller personages of the pageant

the irruption of this motley crew with beat of drum according to
ancient custom was the consummation of uproar and merriment master
simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which as
ancient christmas he walked a minuet with the peerless though giggling
dame mince pie it was followed by a dance of all the characters which
from its medley of costumes seemed as though the old family portraits
had skipped down from their frames to join in the sport different
centuries were figuring at cross hands and right and left the dark
ages were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons and the days of queen
bess jigging merrily down the middle through a line of succeeding
generations

the worthy squire contemplated these fantastic sports and this
resurrection of his old wardrobe with the simple relish of childish
delight he stood chuckling and rubbing his hands and scarcely hearing
a word the parson said notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing
most authentically on the ancient and stately dance of the pavon or
peacock from which he conceived the minuet to be derived for my
part i was in a continual excitement from the varied scenes of whim
and innocent gayety passing before me it was inspiring to see wild-eyed
frolic and warm-hearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills
and glooms of winter and old age throwing off his apathy and catching
once more the freshness of youthful enjoyment i felt also an interest
in the scene from the consideration that these fleeting customs were
posting fast into oblivion and that this was perhaps the only family
in england in which the whole of them was still punctiliously observed
there was a quaintness too mingled with all this revelry that gave
it a peculiar zest it was suited to the time and place and as the old
manor-house almost reeled with mirth and wassail it seemed echoing back
the joviality of long departed years


 sir john hawkins speaking of the dance called the pavon
 from pavo a peacock says it is a grave and majestic
 dance the method of dancing it anciently was by gentlemen
 dressed with caps and swords by those of the long robe in
 their gowns by the peers in their mantles and by the
 ladies in gowns with long trains the motion whereof in
 dancing resembled that of a peacock history of music

 at the time of the first publication of this paper the
 picture of an old-fashioned christmas in the country was
 pronounced by some as out of date the author had afterwards
 an opportunity of witnessing almost all the customs above
 described existing in unexpected vigor in the skirts of
 derbyshire and yorkshire where he passed the christmas
 holidays the reader will find some notice of them in the
 author's account of his sojourn at newstead abbey


but enough of christmas and its gambols it is time for me to pause
in this garrulity methinks i hear the questions asked by my graver
readers to what purpose is all this how is the world to be made
wiser by this talk alas is there not wisdom enough extant for the
instruction of the world and if not are there not thousands of abler
pens laboring for its improvement it is so much pleasanter to please
than to instruct to play the companion rather than the preceptor

what after all is the mite of wisdom that i could throw into the mass
of knowledge or how am i sure that my sagest deductions may be safe
guides for the opinions of others but in writing to amuse if i fail
the only evil is in my own disappointment if however i can by any
lucky chance in these days of evil rub out one wrinkle from the brow
of care or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow if i can now
and then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy prompt a
benevolent view of human nature and make my reader more in good-humor
with his fellow-beings and himself surely surely i shall not then
have written entirely in vain




london antiques

 i do walk
 methinks like guide vaux with my dark lanthorn
 stealing to set the town o fire i th country
 i should be taken for william o the wisp
 or robin goodfellow
 fletcher

i am somewhat of an antiquity-hunter and am fond of exploring london in
quest of the relics of old times these are principally to be found in
the depths of the city swallowed up and almost lost in a wilderness of
brick and mortar but deriving poetical and romantic interest from the
commonplace prosaic world around them i was struck with an instance of
the kind in the course of a recent summer ramble into the city for the
city is only to be explored to advantage in summer-time when free from
the smoke and fog and rain and mud of winter i had been buffeting for
some time against the current of population setting through fleet
street the warm weather had unstrung my nerves and made me sensitive to
every jar and jostle and discordant sound the flesh was weary the
spirit faint and i was getting out of humor with the bustling busy
throng through which i had to struggle when in a fit of desperation i
tore my way through the crowd plunged into a by-lane and after
passing through several obscure nooks and angles emerged into a quaint
and quiet court with a grassplot in the centre overhung by elms and
kept perpetually fresh and green by a fountain with its sparkling jet of
water a student with book in hand was seated on a stone bench partly
reading partly meditating on the movements of two or three trim
nursery-maids with their infant charges

i was like an arab who had suddenly come upon an oasis amid the panting
sterility of the desert by degrees the quiet and coolness of the place
soothed my nerves and refreshed my spirit i pursued my walk and came
hard by to a very ancient chapel with a low-browed saxon portal of
massive and rich architecture the interior was circular and lofty and
lighted from above around were monumental tombs of ancient date on
which were extended the marble effigies of warriors in armor some had
the hands devoutly crossed upon the breast others grasped the pommel of
the sword menacing hostility even in the tomb while the crossed legs
of several indicated soldiers of the faith who had been on crusades to
the holy land

i was in fact in the chapel of the knights templars strangely
situated in the very centre of sordid traffic and i do not know a more
impressive lesson for the many of the world than thus suddenly to turn
aside from the highway of busy money-seeking life and sit down
among these shadowy sepulchres where all is twilight dust and
forget-fullness

in a subsequent tour of observation i encountered another of these
relics of a foregone world locked up in the heart of the city i had
been wandering for some time through dull monotonous streets destitute
of anything to strike the eye or excite the imagination when i beheld
before me a gothic gateway of mouldering antiquity it opened into a
spacious quadrangle forming the courtyard of a stately gothic pile the
portal of which stood invitingly open

it was apparently a public edifice and as i was antiquity-hunting i
ventured in though with dubious steps meeting no one either to oppose
or rebuke my intrusion i continued on until i found myself in a
great hall with a lofty arched roof and oaken gallery all of gothic
architecture at one end of the hall was an enormous fireplace with
wooden settles on each side at the other end was a raised platform
or dais the seat of state above which was the portrait of a man in
antique garb with a long robe a ruff and a venerable gray beard

the whole establishment had an air of monastic quiet and seclusion and
what gave it a mysterious charm was that i had not met with a human
being since i had passed the threshold

encouraged by this loneliness i seated myself in a recess of a large
bow window which admitted a broad flood of yellow sunshine checkered
here and there by tints from panes of colored glass while an open
casement let in the soft summer air here leaning my head on my hand
and my arm on an old oaken table i indulged in a sort of reverie about
what might have been the ancient uses of this edifice it had evidently
been of monastic origin perhaps one of those collegiate establishments
built of yore for the promotion of learning where the patient monk
in the ample solitude of the cloister added page to page and volume to
volume emulating in the productions of his brain the magnitude of the
pile he inhabited

as i was seated in this musing mood a small panelled door in an arch at
the upper end of the hall was opened and a number of gray-headed old
men clad in long black cloaks came forth one by one proceeding in
that manner through the hall without uttering a word each turning a
pale face on me as he passed and disappearing through a door at the
lower end

i was singularly struck with their appearance their black cloaks and
antiquated air comported with the style of this most venerable and
mysterious pile it was as if the ghosts of the departed years about
which i had been musing were passing in review before me pleasing
myself with such fancies i set out in the spirit of romance to
explore what i pictured to myself a realm of shadows existing in the
very centre of substantial realities

my ramble led me through a labyrinth of interior courts and corridors
and dilapidated cloisters for the main edifice had many additions and
dependencies built at various times and in various styles in one open
space a number of boys who evidently belonged to the establishment
were at their sports but everywhere i observed those mysterious
old gray men in black mantles sometimes sauntering alone sometimes
conversing in groups they appeared to be the pervading genii of the
place i now called to mind what i had read of certain colleges in
old times where judicial astrology geomancy necromancy and other
forbidden and magical sciences were taught was this an establishment of
the kind and were these black-cloaked old men really professors of the
black art

these surmises were passing through my mind as my eye glanced into
a chamber hung round with all kinds of strange and uncouth
objects implements of savage warfare strange idols and stuffed
alligators bottled serpents and monsters decorated the mantelpiece
while on the high tester of an old-fashioned bedstead grinned a human
skull flanked on each side by a dried cat

i approached to regard more narrowly this mystic chamber which seemed a
fitting laboratory for a necromancer when i was startled at beholding
a human countenance staring at me from a dusky corner it was that of a
small shrivelled old man with thin cheeks bright eyes and gray wiry
projecting eyebrows i at first doubted whether it were not a mummy
curiously preserved but it moved and i saw that it was alive it was
another of these black-cloaked old men and as i regarded his quaint
physiognomy his obsolete garb and the hideous and sinister objects by
which he was surrounded i began to persuade myself that i had come upon
the arch-mage who ruled over this magical fraternity

seeing me pausing before the door he rose and invited me to enter i
obeyed with singular hardihood for how did i know whether a wave of his
wand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster or conjure me
into one of the bottles on his mantelpiece he proved however to be
anything but a conjurer and his simple garrulity soon dispelled all the
magic and mystery with which i had enveloped this antiquated pile and
its no less antiquated inhabitants

it appeared that i had made my way into the centre of an ancient asylum
for superannuated tradesmen and decayed householders with which was
connected a school for a limited number of boys it was founded upwards
of two centuries since on an old monastic establishment and retained
somewhat of the conventual air and character the shadowy line of old
men in black mantles who had passed before me in the hall and whom i
had elevated into magi turned out to be the pensioners returning from
morning service in the chapel

john hallum the little collector of curiosities whom i had made the
arch magician had been for six years a resident of the place and
had decorated this final nestling-place of his old age with relics
and rarities picked up in the course of his life according to his
own account he had been somewhat of a traveller having been once in
france and very near making a visit to holland he regretted not having
visited the latter country as then he might have said he had been
there he was evidently a traveller of the simple kind

he was aristocratical too in his notions keeping aloof as i found
from the ordinary run of pensioners his chief associates were a blind
man who spoke latin and greek of both which languages hallum was
profoundly ignorant and a broken-down gentleman who had run through
a fortune of forty thousand pounds left him by his father and ten
thousand pounds the marriage portion of his wife little hallum seemed
to consider it an indubitable sign of gentle blood as well as of lofty
spirit to be able to squander such enormous sums

ps the picturesque remnant of old times into which i have thus
beguiled the reader is what is called the charter house originally
the chartreuse it was founded in on the remains of an ancient
convent by sir thomas sutton being one of those noble charities set
on foot by individual munificence and kept up with the quaintness and
sanctity of ancient times amidst the modern changes and innovations
of london here eighty broken-down men who have seen better days
are provided in their old age with food clothing fuel and a yearly
allowance for private expenses they dine together as did the monks of
old in the hall which had been the refectory of the original convent
attached to the establishment is a school for forty-four boys

stow whose work i have consulted on the subject speaking of the
obligations of the gray-headed pensioners says they are not to
intermeddle with any business touching the affairs of the hospital
but to attend only to the service of god and take thankfully what is
provided for them without muttering murmuring or grudging none to
wear weapon long hair colored boots spurs or colored shoes feathers
in their hats or any ruffian-like or unseemly apparel but such as
becomes hospital-men to wear and in truth adds stow happy are
they that are so taken from the cares and sorrows of the world and
fixed in so good a place as these old men are having nothing to care
for but the good of their souls to serve god and to live in brotherly
love

for the amusement of such as have been interested by the preceding
sketch taken down from my own observation and who may wish to know a
little more about the mysteries of london i subjoin a modicum of local
history put into my hands by an odd-looking old gentleman in a small
brown wig and a snuff-colored coat with whom i became acquainted
shortly after my visit to the charter house i confess i was a little
dubious at first whether it was not one of those apocryphal tales often
passed off upon inquiring travellers like myself and which have brought
our general character for veracity into such unmerited reproach on
making proper inquiries however i have received the most satisfactory
assurances of the author's probity and indeed have been told that he
is actually engaged in a full and particular account of the very
interesting region in which he resides of which the following may be
considered merely as a foretaste




little britain

what i write is most true i have a whole booke of cases lying by
me which if i should sette foorth some grave auntients within the
hearing of bow bell would be out of charity with me nash

in the centre of the great city of london lies a small neighborhood
consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts of very venerable
and debilitated houses which goes by the name of little britain christ
church school and st bartholomew's hospital bound it on the west
smithfield and long lane on the north aldersgate street like an arm
of the sea divides it from the eastern part of the city whilst the
yawning gulf of bull-and-mouth street separates it from butcher lane
and the regions of newgate over this little territory thus bounded and
designated the great dome of st paul's swelling above the intervening
houses of paternoster row amen corner and ave-maria lane looks down
with an air of motherly protection

this quarter derives its appellation from having been in ancient times
the residence of the dukes of brittany as london increased however
rank and fashion rolled off to the west and trade creeping on at their
heels took possession of their deserted abodes for some time little
britain became the great mart of learning and was peopled by the busy
and prolific race of booksellers these also gradually deserted it and
emigrating beyond the great strait of newgate street settled down
in paternoster row and st paul's churchyard where they continue to
increase and multiply even at the present day

but though thus fallen into decline little britain still bears traces
of its former splendor there are several houses ready to tumble down
the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings
of hideous faces unknown birds beasts and fishes and fruits and
flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify there are also
in aldersgate street certain remains of what were once spacious and
lordly family mansions but which have in latter days been subdivided
into several tenements here may often be found the family of a petty
tradesman with its trumpery furniture burrowing among the relics of
antiquated finery in great rambling time-stained apartments with fretted
ceilings gilded cornices and enormous marble fireplaces the lanes and
courts also contain many smaller houses not on so grand a scale but
like your small ancient gentry sturdily maintaining their claims to
equal antiquity these have their gable ends to the street great bow
windows with diamond panes set in lead grotesque carvings and low
arched doorways


 it is evident that the author of this interesting
 communication has included in his general title of little
 britain man of those little lanes and courts that belong
 immediately to cloth fair


in this most venerable and sheltered little nest have i passed several
quiet years of existence comfortably lodged in the second floor of
one of the smallest but oldest edifices my sitting-room is an old
wainscoted chamber with small panels and set off with a miscellaneous
array of furniture i have a particular respect for three or four
high-backed claw-footed chairs covered with tarnished brocade which
bear the marks of having seen better days and have doubtless figured
in some of the old palaces of little britain they seem to me to
keep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their
leathern-bottomed neighbors as i have seen decayed gentry carry a
high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to
associate the whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a
bow window on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous
occupants for many generations mingled with scraps of very indifferent
gentleman-like poetry written in characters which i can scarcely
decipher and which extol the charms of many a beauty of little britain
who has long long since bloomed faded and passed away as i am an
idle personage with no apparent occupation and pay my bill regularly
every week i am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of
the neighborhood and being curious to learn the internal state of a
community so apparently shut up within itself i have managed to work my
way into all the concerns and secrets of the place

little britain may truly be called the heart's core of the city the
stronghold of true john bullism it is a fragment of london as it was in
its better days with its antiquated folks and fashions here flourish
in great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore
the inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on shrove tuesday hot
cross-buns on good friday and roast goose at michaelmas they send
love-letters on valentine's day burn the pope on the fifth of november
and kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at christmas roast beef and
plum-pudding are also held in superstitious veneration and port and
sherry maintain their grounds as the only true english wines all others
being considered vile outlandish beverages

little britain has its long catalogue of city wonders which its
inhabitants consider the wonders of the world such as the great bell
of st paul's which sours all the beer when it tolls the figures that
strike the hours at st dunstan's clock the monument the lions in the
tower and the wooden giants in guildhall they still believe in dreams
and fortune-telling and an old woman that lives in bull-and-mouth
street makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods
and promising the girls good husbands they are apt to be rendered
uncomfortable by comets and eclipses and if a dog howls dolefully at
night it is looked upon as a sure sign of death in the place there
are even many ghost-stories current particularly concerning the old
mansion-houses in several of which it is said strange sights are
sometimes seen lords and ladies the former in full-bottomed wigs
hanging sleeves and swords the latter in lappets stays hoops and
brocade have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers
on moonlight nights and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient
proprietors in their court-dresses

little britain has likewise its sages and great men one of the most
important of the former is a tall dry old gentleman of the name
of skryme who keeps a small apothecary's shop he has a cadaverous
countenance full of cavities and projections with a brown circle round
each eye like a pair of horn spectacles he is much thought of by the
old women who consider him as a kind of conjurer because he has two or
three stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop and several snakes in
bottles he is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers and is much
given to pore over alarming accounts of plots conspiracies fires
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which last phenomena he considers
as signs of the times he has always some dismal tale of the kind to
deal out to his customers with their doses and thus at the same time
puts both soul and body into an uproar he is a great believer in omens
and predictions and has the prophecies of robert nixon and mother
shipton by heart no man can make so much out of an eclipse or even
an unusually dark day and he shook the tail of the last comet over the
heads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly frightened
out of their wits he has lately got hold of a popular legend or
prophecy on which he has been unusually eloquent there has been a
saying current among the ancient sibyls who treasure up these things
that when the grasshopper on the top of the exchange shook hands with
the dragon on the top of bow church steeple fearful events would take
place this strange conjunction it seems has as strangely come to
pass the same architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the
cupola of the exchange and the steeple of bow church and fearful to
relate the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie cheek by jole in
the yard of his workshop

others as mr skryme is accustomed to say may go star-gazing and
look for conjunctions in the heavens but here is a conjunction on the
earth near at home and under our own eyes which surpasses all
the signs and calculations of astrologers since these portentous
weathercocks have thus laid their heads together wonderful events had
already occurred the good old king notwithstanding that he had lived
eighty-two years had all at once given up the ghost another king had
mounted the throne a royal duke had died suddenly another in france
had been murdered there had been radical meetings in all parts of the
kingdom the bloody scenes at manchester the great plot in cato street
and above all the queen had returned to england all these sinister
events are recounted by mr skyrme with a mysterious look and a dismal
shake of the head and being taken with his drugs and associated in the
minds of his auditors with stuffed-sea-monsters bottled serpents and
his own visage which is a title-page of tribulation they have spread
great gloom through the minds of the people of little britain they
shake their heads whenever they go by bow church and observe that they
never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple which in
old times told nothing but glad tidings as the history of whittington
and his cat bears witness

the rival oracle of little britain is a substantial cheesemonger
who lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions and is as
magnificently lodged as a round-bellied mite in the midst of one of his
own cheshires indeed he is a man of no little standing and importance
and his renown extends through huggin lane and lad lane and even unto
aldermanbury his opinion is very much taken in affairs of state having
read the sunday papers for the last half century together with
the gentleman's magazine rapin's history of england and the naval
chronicle his head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne
the test of time and use for centuries it is his firm opinion that
it is a moral impossible so long as england is true to herself that
anything can shake her and he has much to say on the subject of the
national debt which somehow or other he proves to be a great national
bulwark and blessing he passed the greater part of his life in the
purlieus of little britain until of late years when having become
rich and grown into the dignity of a sunday cane he begins to take his
pleasure and see the world he has therefore made several excursions to
hampstead highgate and other neighboring towns where he has passed
whole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a telescope
and endeavoring to descry the steeple of st bartholomew's not a
stage-coachman of bull-and-mouth street but touches his hat as he
passes and he is considered quite a patron at the coach-office of the
goose and gridiron st paul's churchyard his family have been very
urgent for him to make an expedition to margate but he has great doubts
of those new gimcracks the steamboats and indeed thinks himself too
advanced in life to undertake sea-voyages

little britain has occasionally its factions and divisions and party
spirit ran very high at one time in consequence of two rival burial
societies being set up in the place one held its meeting at the swan
and horse-shoe and was patronized by the cheesemonger the other at the
cock and crown under the auspices of the apothecary it is needless to
say that the latter was the most flourishing i have passed an evening
or two at each and have acquired much valuable information as to
the best mode of being buried the comparative merits of churchyards
together with divers hints on the subject of patent iron coffins i have
heard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality
of prohibiting the latter on account of their durability the feuds
occasioned by these societies have happily died of late but they were
for a long time prevailing themes of controversy the people of little
britain being extremely solicitous of funeral honors and of lying
comfortably in their graves

besides these two funeral societies there is a third of quite a
different cast which tends to throw the sunshine of good-humor over the
whole neighborhood it meets once a week at a little old-fashioned
house kept by a jolly publican of the name of wagstaff and bearing for
insignia a resplendent half-moon with a most seductive bunch of grapes
the whole edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the
thirsty wayfarer such as truman hanbury and co's entire wine
rum and brandy vaults old tom rum and compounds etc this indeed
has been a temple of bacchus and momus from time immemorial it has
always been in the family of the wagstaffs so that its history is
tolerably preserved by the present landlord it was much frequented by
the gallants and cavalieros of the reign of elizabeth and was looked
into now and then by the wits of charles the second's day but what
wagstaff principally prides himself upon is that henry the eighth in
one of his nocturnal rambles broke the head of one of his ancestors
with his famous walking-staff this however is considered as rather a
dubious and vain-glorious boast of the landlord

the club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of
the roaring lads of little britain they abound in old catches glees
and choice stories that are traditional in the place and not to be met
with in any other part of the metropolis there is a madcap undertaker
who is inimitable at a merry song but the life of the club and
indeed the prime wit of little britain is bully wagstaff himself his
ancestors were all wags before him and he has inherited with the inn
a large stock of songs and jokes which go with it from generation to
generation as heirlooms he is a dapper little fellow with bandy legs
and pot belly a red face with a moist merry eye and a little shock of
gray hair behind at the opening of every club night he is called in to
sing his confession of faith which is the famous old drinking trowl
from gammer gurton's needle he sings it to be sure with many
variations as he received it from his father's lips for it has been a
standing favorite at the half-moon and bunch of grapes ever since it was
written nay he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor
of singing it before the nobility and gentry at christmas mummeries
when little britain was in all its glory


 as mine host of the half-moon's confession of faith may
 not be familiar to the majority of readers and as it is a
 specimen of the current songs of little britain i subjoin
 it in its original orthography i would observe that the
 whole club always join in the chorus with a fearful thumping
 on the table and clattering of pewter pots

 i cannot eate but lytle meate
 my stomacke is not good
 but sure i thinke that i can drinke
 with him that weares a hood
 though i go bare take ye no care
 i nothing am a colde
 i stuff my skyn so full within
 of joly good ale and olde

 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare
 both foote and hand go colde
 but belly god send thee good ale ynoughe
 whether it be new or olde

 i have no rost but a nut brawne toste
 and a crab laid in the fyre
 a little breade shall do me steade
 much breade i not desyre
 no frost nor snow nor winde i trowe
 can hurte mee if i wolde
 i am so wrapt and throwly lapt
 of joly good ale and olde

 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare etc

 and tyb my wife that as her lyfe
 loveth well good ale to seeke
 full oft drynkes shee tyll ye may see
 the teares run downe her cheeke
 then doth shee trowle to me the bowle
 even as a mault-worme sholde
 and sayth sweete harte i took my parte
 of this jolly good ale and olde

 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare etc

 now let them drynke tyll they nod and winke
 even as goode fellowes sholde doe
 they shall not mysse to have the blisse
 good ale doth bring men to
 and all poore soules that have scowred bowles
 or have them lustily trolde
 god save the lyves of them and their wives
 whether they be yonge or olde
 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare etc


it would do one's heart good to hear on a club night the shouts of
merriment the snatches of song and now and then the choral bursts of
half a dozen discordant voices which issue from this jovial mansion at
such times the street is lined with listeners who enjoy a delight equal
to that of gazing into a confectioner's window or snuffing up the steams
of a cook-shop

there are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in
little britain these are st bartholomew's fair and the lord mayor's
day during the time of the fair which is held in the adjoining regions
of smithfield there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding
about the late quiet streets of little britain are overrun with an
irruption of strange figures and faces every tavern is a scene of rout
and revel the fiddle and the song are heard from the taproom morning
noon and night and at each window may be seen some group of boon
companions with half-shut eyes hats on one side pipe in mouth and
tankard in hand fondling and prosing and singing maudlin songs over
their liquor even the sober decorum of private families which i must
say is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbors is no proof
against this saturnalia there is no such thing as keeping maid-servants
within doors their brains are absolutely set madding with punch and
the puppet-show the flying horses signior polito the fire-eater the
celebrated mr paap and the irish giant the children too lavish all
their holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread and fill the house
with the lilliputian din of drums trumpets and penny whistles

but the lord mayor's day is the great anniversary the lord mayor
is looked up to by the inhabitants of little britain as the greatest
potentate upon earth his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of
human splendor and his procession with all the sheriffs and aldermen
in his train as the grandest of earthly pageants how they exult in
the idea that the king himself dare not enter the city without first
knocking at the gate of temple bar and asking permission of the lord
mayor for if he did heaven and earth there is no knowing what might
be the consequence the man in armor who rides before the lord mayor
and is the city champion has orders to cut down everybody that offends
against the dignity of the city and then there is the little man with a
velvet porringer on his head who sits at the window of the state coach
and holds the city sword as long as a pikestaff odd's blood if he
once draws that sword majesty itself is not safe

under the protection of this mighty potentate therefore the good
people of little britain sleep in peace temple bar is an effectual
barrier against all interior foes and as to foreign invasion the lord
mayor has but to throw himself into the tower call in the train-bands
and put the standing army of beef-eaters under arms and he may bid
defiance to the world

thus wrapped up in its own concerns its own habits and its own
opinions little britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this
great fungous metropolis i have pleased myself with considering it as
a chosen spot where the principles of sturdy john bullism were garnered
up like seed corn to renew the national character when it had run
to waste and degeneracy i have rejoiced also in the general spirit of
harmony that prevailed throughout it for though there might now
and then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the
cheesemonger and the apothecary and an occasional feud between the
burial societies yet these were but transient clouds and soon passed
away the neighbors met with good-will parted with a shake of the hand
and never abused each other except behind their backs

i could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which i
have been present where we played at all-fours pope-joan
tom-come-tickle-me and other choice old games and where we sometimes
had a good old english country dance to the tune of sir roger de
coverley once a year also the neighbors would gather together and go on
a gypsy party to epping forest it would have done any man's heart good
to see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on the grass
under the trees how we made the woods ring with bursts of laughter at
the songs of little wagstaff and the merry undertaker after dinner
too the young folks would play at blindman's-buff and hide-and-seek
and it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers and to hear a
fine romping girl now and then squeak from among the bushes the elder
folks would gather round the cheesemonger and the apothecary to hear
them talk politics for they generally brought out a newspaper in their
pockets to pass away time in the country they would now and then to
be sure get a little warm in argument but their disputes were always
adjusted by reference to a worthy old umbrella-maker in a double chin
who never exactly comprehending the subject managed somehow or other
to decide in favor of both parties

all empires however says some philosopher or historian are doomed to
changes and revolutions luxury and innovation creep in factions arise
and families now and then spring up whose ambition and intrigues
throw the whole system into confusion thus in letter days has the
tranquillity of little britain been grievously disturbed and its golden
simplicity of manners threatened with total subversion by the aspiring
family of a retired butcher

the family of the lambs had long been among the most thriving and
popular in the neighborhood the miss lambs were the belles of little
britain and everybody was pleased when old lamb had made money enough
to shut up shop and put his name on a brass plate on his door in an
evil hour however one of the miss lambs had the honor of being a lady
in attendance on the lady mayoress at her grand annual ball on which
occasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head the
family never got over it they were immediately smitten with a passion
for high life set up a one-horse carriage put a bit of gold lace round
the errand-boy's hat and have been the talk and detestation of the
whole neighborhood ever since they could no longer be induced to
play at pope-joan or blindman's-buff they could endure no dances but
quadrilles which nobody had ever heard of in little britain and they
took to reading novels talking bad french and playing upon the piano
their brother too who had been articled to an attorney set up for a
dandy and a critic characters hitherto unknown in these parts and
he confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about kean the
opera and the edinburgh review

what was still worse the lambs gave a grand ball to which they
neglected to invite any of their old neighbors but they had a great
deal of genteel company from theobald's road red lion square and other
parts towards the west there were several beaux of their brother's
acquaintance from gray's inn lane and hatton garden and not less
than three aldermen's ladies with their daughters this was not to be
forgotten or forgiven all little britain was in an uproar with the
smacking of whips the lashing of in miserable horses and the rattling
and jingling of hackney-coaches the gossips of the neighborhood might
be seen popping their night-caps out at every window watching the crazy
vehicles rumble by and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that
kept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher's and
scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door

this dance was a cause of almost open war and the whole neighborhood
declared they would have nothing more to say to the lambs it is
true that mrs lamb when she had no engagements with her quality
acquaintance would give little humdrum tea-junketings to some of her
old cronies quite as she would say in a friendly way and it is
equally true that her invitations were always accepted in spite of all
previous vows to the contrary nay the good ladies would sit and be
delighted with the music of the miss lambs who would condescend to
strum an irish melody for them on the piano and they would listen
with wonderful interest to mrs lamb's anecdotes of alderman plunket's
family of portsoken ward and the miss timberlakes the rich heiresses
of crutched friars but then they relieved their consciences and averted
the reproaches of their confederates by canvassing at the next gossiping
convocation everything that had passed and pulling the lambs and their
rout all to pieces

the only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the
retired butcher himself honest lamb in spite of the meekness of his
name was a rough hearty old fellow with the voice of a lion a head
of black hair like a shoe-brush and a broad face mottled like his own
beef it was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as the old
gentleman addressed him as papa in tones of infinite softness
and endeavored to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers and other
gentlemanly habits do what they might there was no keeping down the
butcher his sturdy nature would break through all their glozings he
had a hearty vulgar good-humor that was irrepressible his very jokes
made his sensitive daughters shudder and he persisted in wearing his
blue cotton coat of a morning dining at two o'clock and having a bit
of sausage with his tea

he was doomed however to share the unpopularity of his family he
found his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him no
longer laughing at his jokes and now and then throwing out a fling at
some people and a hint about quality binding this both nettled
and perplexed the honest butcher and his wife and daughters with
the consummate policy of the shrewder sex taking advantage of the
circumstance at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoon's
pipe and tankard at wagstaff's to sit after dinner by himself and
take his pint of port a liquor he detested and to nod in his chair in
solitary and dismal gentility

the miss lambs might now be seen flaunting along the streets in french
bonnets with unknown beaux and talking and laughing so loud that it
distressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing they even went
so far as to attempt patronage and actually induced a french dancing
master to set up in the neighborhood but the worthy folks of little
britain took fire at it and did so persecute the poor gaul that he
was fain to pack up fiddle and dancing-pumps and decamp with such
precipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings

i had flattered myself at first with the idea that all this fiery
indignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of
their zeal for good old english manners and their horror of innovation
and i applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in
expressing for upstart pride french fashions and the miss lambs but
i grieve to say that i soon perceived the infection had taken hold
and that my neighbors after condemning were beginning to follow their
example i overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their
daughters have one quarter at french and music and that they might take
a few lessons in quadrille i even saw in the course of a few sundays
no less than five french bonnets precisely like those of the miss
lambs parading about little britain

i still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away that
the lambs might move out of the neighborhood might die or might run
away with attorneys apprentices and that quiet and simplicity might be
again restored to the community but unluckily a rival power arose an
opulent oilman died and left a widow with a large jointure and a family
of buxom daughters the young ladies had long been repining in secret
at the parsimony of a prudent father which kept down all their elegant
aspirings their ambition being now no longer restrained broke out
into a blaze and they openly took the field against the family of the
butcher it is true that the lambs having had the first start had
naturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career they could
speak a little bad french play the piano dance quadrilles and had
formed high acquaintances but the trotters were not to be distanced
when the lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats the miss
trotters mounted four and of twice as fine colors if the lambs gave
a dance the trotters were sure not to be behindhand and though they
might not boast of as good company yet they had double the number and
were twice as merry

the whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable
factions under the banners of these two families the old games of
pope-joan and tom-come-tickle-me are entirely discarded there is no
such thing as getting up an honest country dance and on my attempting
to kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last christmas i was
indignantly repulsed the miss lambs having pronounced it shocking
vulgar bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable
part of little britain the lambs standing up for the dignity
of cross-keys square and the trotters for the vicinity of st
bartholomew's

thus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions
like the great empire whose name it bears and what will be the result
would puzzle the apothecary himself with all his talent at prognostics
to determine though i apprehend that it will terminate in the total
downfall of genuine john bullism

the immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me being a single
man and as i observed before rather an idle good-for-nothing
personage i have been considered the only gentleman by profession in
the place i stand therefore in high favor with both parties and have
to hear all their cabinet counsels and mutual backbitings as i am too
civil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions i have committed
myself most horribly with both parties by abusing their opponents
i might manage to reconcile this to my conscience which is a truly
accommodating one but i cannot to my apprehension if the lambs and
trotters ever come to a reconciliation and compare notes i am ruined

i have determined therefore to beat a retreat in time and am actually
looking out for some other nest in this great city where old english
manners are still kept up where french is neither eaten drunk danced
nor spoken and where there are no fashionable families of retired
tradesmen this found i will like a veteran rat hasten away before i
have an old house about my ears bid a long though a sorrowful adieu
to my present abode and leave the rival factions of the lambs and the
trotters to divide the distracted empire of little britain




stratford-on-avon

thou soft-flowing avon by thy silver stream of things more than mortal
sweet shakespeare would dream the fairies by moonlight dance round his
green bed for hallow'd the turf is which pillow'd his head

garrick

to a homeless man who has no spot on this wide world which he can
truly call his own there is a momentary feeling of something like
independence and territorial consequence when after a weary day's
travel he kicks off his boots thrusts his feet into slippers and
stretches himself before an inn-fire let the world without go as it
may let kingdoms rise or fall so long as he has the wherewithal to pay
his bill he is for the time being the very monarch of all he surveys
the armchair is his throne the poker his sceptre and the little
parlor some twelve feet square his undisputed empire it is a morsel
of certainly snatched from the midst of the uncertainties of life it
is a sunny moment gleaming out kindly on a cloudy day and he who has
advanced some way on the pilgrimage of existence knows the importance of
husbanding even morsels and moments of enjoyment shall i not take mine
ease in mine inn thought i as i gave the fire a stir lolled back in
my elbow-chair and cast a complacent look about the little parlor of
the red horse at stratford-on-avon

the words of sweet shakespeare were just passing through my mind as
the clock struck midnight from the tower of the church in which he lies
buried there was a gentle tap at the door and a pretty chambermaid
putting in her smiling face inquired with a hesitating air whether i
had rung i understood it as a modest hint that it was time to retire
my dream of absolute dominion was at an end so abdicating my throne
like a prudent potentate to avoid being deposed and putting the
stratford guide-book under my arm as a pillow companion i went to bed
and dreamt all night of shakespeare the jubilee and david garrick

the next morning was one of those quickening mornings which we sometimes
have in early spring for it was about the middle of march the chills
of a long winter had suddenly given way the north wind had spent its
last gasp and a mild air came stealing from the west breathing the
breath of life into nature and wooing every bud and flower to burst
forth into fragrance and beauty

i had come to stratford on a poetical pilgrimage my first visit was to
the house where shakespeare was born and where according to tradition
he was brought up to his father's craft of wool-combing it is a small
mean-looking edifice of wood and plaster a true nestling-place of
genius which seems to delight in hatching its offspring in by-corners
the walls of its squalid chambers are covered with names and
inscriptions in every language by pilgrims of all nations ranks and
conditions from the prince to the peasant and present a simple but
striking instance of the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to
the great poet of nature

the house is shown by a garrulous old lady in a frosty red face lighted
up by a cold blue anxious eye and garnished with artificial locks
of flaxen hair curling from under an exceedingly dirty cap she was
peculiarly assiduous in exhibiting the relics with which this like all
other celebrated shrines abounds there was the shattered stock of
the very matchlock with which shakespeare shot the deer on his poaching
exploits there too was his tobacco-box which proves that he was a
rival smoker of sir walter raleigh the sword also with which he played
hamlet and the identical lantern with which friar laurence discovered
romeo and juliet at the tomb there was an ample supply also of
shakespeare's mulberry tree which seems to have as extraordinary powers
of self-multiplication as the wood of the true cross of which there is
enough extant to build a ship of the line

the most favorite object of curiosity however is shakespeare's chair
it stands in a chimney-nook of a small gloomy chamber just behind what
was his father's shop here he may many a time have sat when a boy
watching the slowly revolving spit with all the longing of an urchin or
of an evening listening to the cronies and gossips of stratford dealing
forth churchyard tales and legendary anecdotes of the troublesome times
of england in this chair it is the custom of every one that visits the
house to sit whether this be done with the hope of imbibing any of
the inspiration of the bard i am at a loss to say i merely mention the
fact and mine hostess privately assured me that though built of solid
oak such was the fervent zeal of devotees the chair had to be new
bottomed at least once in three years it is worthy of notice also in
the history of this extraordinary chair that it partakes something of
the volatile nature of the santa casa of loretto or the flying chair
of the arabian enchanter for though sold some few years since to a
northern princess yet strange to tell it has found its way back again
to the old chimney-corner

i am always of easy faith in such matters and am ever willing to be
deceived where the deceit is pleasant and costs nothing i am therefore
a ready believer in relics legends and local anecdotes of goblins
and great men and would advise all travellers who travel for their
gratification to be the same what is it to us whether these stories be
true or false so long as we can persuade ourselves into the belief
of them and enjoy all the charm of the reality there is nothing like
resolute good-humored credulity in these matters and on this occasion i
went even so far as willingly to believe the claims of mine hostess to a
lineal descent from the poet when unluckily for my faith she put into
my hands a play of her own composition which set all belief in her own
consanguinity at defiance

from the birthplace of shakespeare a few paces brought me to his
grave he lies buried in the chancel of the parish church a large and
venerable pile mouldering with age but richly ornamented it stands on
the banks of the avon on an embowered point and separated by adjoining
gardens from the suburbs of the town its situation is quiet and
retired the river runs murmuring at the foot of the churchyard and
the elms which grow upon its banks droop their branches into its clear
bosom an avenue of limes the boughs of which are curiously interlaced
so as to form in summer an arched way of foliage leads up from the gate
of the yard to the church-porch the graves are overgrown with grass
the gray tombstones some of them nearly sunk into the earth are half
covered with moss which has likewise tinted the reverend old building
small birds have built their nests among the cornices and fissures of
the walls and keep up a continual flutter and chirping and rooks are
sailing and cawing about its lofty gray spire

in the course of my rambles i met with the gray-headed sexton edmonds
and accompanied him home to get the key of the church he had lived in
stratford man and boy for eighty years and seemed still to consider
himself a vigorous man with the trivial exception that he had nearly
lost the use of his legs for a few years past his dwelling was a
cottage looking out upon the avon and its bordering meadows and was a
picture of that neatness order and comfort which pervade the humblest
dwellings in this country a low whitewashed room with a stone floor
carefully scrubbed served for parlor kitchen and hall rows of pewter
and earthen dishes glittered along the dresser on an old oaken table
well rubbed and polished lay the family bible and prayer-book and the
drawer contained the family library composed of about half a score
of well-thumbed volumes an ancient clock that important article of
cottage furniture ticked on the opposite side of the room with
a bright warming-pan hanging on one side of it and the old man's
horn-handled sunday cane on the other the fireplace as usual was wide
and deep enough to admit a gossip knot within its jambs in one corner
sat the old man's granddaughter sewing a pretty blue-eyed girl and in
the opposite corner was a superannuated crony whom he addressed by
the name of john ange and who i found had been his companion from
childhood they had played together in infancy they had worked together
in manhood they were now tottering about and gossiping away the evening
of life and in a short time they will probably be buried together in
the neighboring churchyard it is not often that we see two streams of
existence running thus evenly and tranquilly side by side it is only in
such quiet bosom scenes of life that they are to be met with

i had hoped to gather some traditionary anecdotes of the bard from
these ancient chroniclers but they had nothing new to impart the long
interval during which shakespeare's writings lay in comparative neglect
has spread its shadow over his history and it is his good or evil lot
that scarcely anything remains to his biographers but a scanty handful
of conjectures

the sexton and his companion had been employed as carpenters on the
preparations for the celebrated stratford jubilee and they
remembered garrick the prime mover of the fete who superintended the
arrangements and who according to the sexton was a short punch man
very lively and bustling john ange had assisted also in cutting down
shakespeare's mulberry tree of which he had a morsel in his pocket for
sale no doubt a sovereign quickener of literary conception

i was grieved to hear these two worthy wights speak very dubiously of
the eloquent dame who shows the shakespeare house john ange shook
his head when i mentioned her valuable and inexhaustible collection
of relics particularly her remains of the mulberry tree and the old
sexton even expressed a doubt as to shakespeare having been born in her
house i soon discovered that he looked upon her mansion with an evil
eye as a rival to the poet's tomb the latter having comparatively but
few visitors thus it is that historians differ at the very outset and
mere pebbles make the stream of truth diverge into different channels
even at the fountain-head

we approached the church through the avenue of limes and entered by a
gothic porch highly ornamented with carved doors of massive oak the
interior is spacious and the architecture and embellishments superior
to those of most country churches there are several ancient monuments
of nobility and gentry over some of which hang funeral escutcheons and
banners dropping piecemeal from the walls the tomb of shakespeare is in
the chancel the place is solemn and sepulchral tall elms wave before
the pointed windows and the avon which runs at a short distance from
the walls keeps up a low perpetual murmur a flat stone marks the spot
where the bard is buried there are four lines inscribed on it said to
have been written by himself and which have in them something extremely
awful if they are indeed his own they show that solicitude about
the quiet of the grave which seems natural to fine sensibilities and
thoughtful minds

 good friend for jesus sake forbeare
 to dig the dust inclosed here
 blessed be he that spares these stones
 and curst be he that moves my bones

just over the grave in a niche of the wall is a bust of shakespeare
put up shortly after his death and considered as a resemblance the
aspect is pleasant and serene with a finely-arched forehead and i
thought i could read in it clear indications of that cheerful
social disposition by which he was as much characterized among his
contemporaries as by the vastness of his genius the inscription
mentions his age at the time of his decease fifty-three years an
untimely death for the world for what fruit might not have been
expected from the golden autumn of such a mind sheltered as it was
from the stormy vicissitudes of life and flourishing in the sunshine of
popular and royal favor

the inscription on the tombstone has not been without its effect it has
prevented the removal of his remains from the bosom of his native place
to westminster abbey which was at one time contemplated a few years
since also as some laborers were digging to make an adjoining vault
the earth caved in so as to leave a vacant space almost like an arch
through which one might have reached into his grave no one however
presumed to meddle with his remains so awfully guarded by a malediction
and lest any of the idle or the curious or any collector of relics
should be tempted to commit depredations the old sexton kept watch over
the place for two days until the vault was finished and the aperture
closed again he told me that he had made bold to look in at the
hole but could see neither coffin nor bones nothing but dust it was
something i thought to have seen the dust of shakespeare

next to this grave are those of his wife his favorite daughter
mrs hall and others of his family on a tomb close by also is a
full-length effigy of his old friend john combe of usurious memory
on whom he is said to have written a ludicrous epitaph there are other
monuments around but the mind refuses to dwell on anything that is not
connected with shakespeare his idea pervades the place the whole pile
seems but as his mausoleum the feelings no longer checked and thwarted
by doubt here indulge in perfect confidence other traces of him may be
false or dubious but here is palpable evidence and absolute certainty
as i trod the sounding pavement there was something intense and
thrilling in the idea that in very truth the remains of shakespeare were
mouldering beneath my feet it was a long time before i could prevail
upon myself to leave the place and as i passed through the churchyard
i plucked a branch from one of the yew trees the only relic that i have
brought from stratford

i had now visited the usual objects of a pilgrim's devotion but i had
a desire to see the old family seat of the lucys at charlecot and to
ramble through the park where shakespeare in company with some of
the roisterers of stratford committed his youthful offence of
deer-stealing in this harebrained exploit we are told that he was taken
prisoner and carried to the keeper's lodge where he remained all night
in doleful captivity when brought into the presence of sir thomas lucy
his treatment must have been galling and humiliating for it so wrought
upon his spirit as to produce a rough pasquinade which was affixed to
the park gate at charlecot

this flagitious attack upon the dignity of the knight so incensed him
that he applied to a lawyer at warwick to put the severity of the laws
in force against the rhyming deer-stalker shakespeare did not wait
to brave the united puissance of a knight of the shire and a country
attorney he forthwith abandoned the pleasant banks of the avon and
his paternal trade wandered away to london became a hanger-on to the
theatres then an actor and finally wrote for the stage and
thus through the persecution of sir thomas lucy stratford lost an
indifferent wool-comber and the world gained an immortal poet he
retained however for a long time a sense of the harsh treatment of
the lord of charlecot and revenged himself in his writings but in
the sportive way of a good-natured mind sir thomas is said to be the
original of justice shallow and the satire is slyly fixed upon him by
the justice's armorial bearings which like those of the knight had
white luces in the quarterings


 the following is the only stanza extant of this lampoon

 a parliament member a justice of peace
 at home a poor scarecrow at london an asse
 if lowsie is lucy as some volke miscalle it
 then lucy is lowsie whatever befall it
 he thinks himself great
 yet an asse in his state
 we allow by his ears but with asses to mate
 if lucy is lowsie as some volke miscalle it
 then sing lowsie lucy whatever befall it

 the luce is a pike or jack and abounds in the avon about
 charlecot


various attempts have been made by his biographers to soften and explain
away this early transgression of the poet but i look upon it as one
of those thoughtless exploits natural to his situation and turn of mind
shakespeare when young had doubtless all the wildness and irregularity
of an ardent undisciplined and undirected genius the poetic
temperament has naturally something in it of the vagabond when left to
itself it runs loosely and wildly and delights in everything eccentric
and licentious it is often a turn up of a die in the gambling freaks
of fate whether a natural genius shall turn out a great rogue or a
great poet and had not shakespeare's mind fortunately taken a literary
bias he might have as daringly transcended all civil as he has all
dramatic laws

i have little doubt that in early life when running like an unbroken
colt about the neighborbood of stratford he was to be found in the
company of all kinds of odd anomalous characters that he associated
with all the madcaps of the place and was one of those unlucky urchins
at mention of whom old men shake their heads and predict that they will
one day come to the gallows to him the poaching in sir thomas lucy's
park was doubtless like a foray to a scottish knight and struck
his eager and as yet untamed imagination as something delightfully
adventurous


 a proof of shakespeare's random habits and associates in
 his youthful days may be found in a traditionary anecdote
 picked up at stratford by the elder ireland and mentioned
 in his picturesque views on the avon

about seven miles from stratford lies the thirsty little market-town of
bedford famous for its ale two societies of the village yeomanry used
to meet under the appellation of the bedford topers and to challenge
the lovers of good ale of the neighboring villages to a contest of
drinking among others the people of stratford were called out to prove
the strength of their heads and in the number of the champions was
shakespeare who in spite of the proverb that they who drink beer
will think beer was as true to his ale as falstaff to his sack the
chivalry of stratford was staggered at the first onset and sounded a
retreat while they had yet the legs to carry them off the field they
had scarcely marched a mile when their legs failing them they were
forced to lie down under a crab tree where they passed the night it
was still standing and goes by the name of shakespeare's tree

in the morning his companions awaked the bard and proposed returning to
bedford but he declined saying he had enough having drank with

 piping pebworth dancing marston
 haunted hilbro hungry grafton
 dudging exhall papist wicksford
 beggarly broom and drunken bedford

the villages here alluded to says ireland still bear the epithets
thus given them the people of pebworth are still famed for their skill
on the pipe and tabor hilborough is now called haunted hilborough and
grafton is famous for the poverty of its soil


the old mansion of charlecot and its surrounding park still remain in
the possession of the lucy family and are peculiarly interesting front
being connected with this whimsical but eventful circumstance in the
scanty history of the bard as the house stood at little more than three
miles distance from stratford i resolved to pay it a pedestrian visit
that i might stroll leisurely through some of those scenes from which
shakespeare must have derived his earliest ideas of rural imagery

the country was yet naked and leafless but english scenery is always
verdant and the sudden change in the temperature of the weather
was surprising in its quickening effects upon the landscape it was
inspiring and animating to witness this first awakening of spring to
feel its warm breath stealing over the senses to see the moist mellow
earth beginning to put forth the green sprout and the tender blade and
the trees and shrubs in their reviving tints and bursting buds giving
the promise of returning foliage and flower the cold snow-drop that
little borderer on the skirts of winter was to be seen with its chaste
white blossoms in the small gardens before the cottages the bleating
of the new-dropt lambs was faintly heard from the fields the sparrow
twittered about the thatched eaves and budding hedges the robin threw
a livelier note into his late querulous wintry strain and the lark
springing up from the reeking bosom of the meadow towered away into the
bright fleecy cloud pouring forth torrents of melody as i watched the
little songster mounting up higher and higher until his body was a mere
speck on the white bosom of the cloud while the ear was still filled
with his music it called to mind shakespeare's exquisite little song in
cymbeline

 hark hark the lark at heav'n's gate sings
 and phoebus gins arise
 his steeds to water at those springs
 on chaliced flowers that lies

 and winking mary-buds begin
 to ope their golden eyes
 with every thing that pretty bin
 my lady sweet arise

indeed the whole country about here is poetic ground everything is
associated with the idea of shakespeare every old cottage that i saw
i fancied into some resort of his boyhood where he had acquired his
intimate knowledge of rustic life and manners and heard those legendary
tales and wild superstitions which he has woven like witchcraft into
his dramas for in his time we are told it was a popular amusement in
winter evenings to sit round the fire and tell merry tales of errant
knights queens lovers lords ladies giants dwarfs thieves
cheaters witches fairies goblins and friars


 scot in his discoverie of witchcraft enumerates a of
 these fireside fancies and they have so fraid us with host
 bull-beggars spirits witches urchins elves hags
 fairies satyrs pans faunes syrens kit with the can
 sticke tritons centaurs dwarfes giantes imps calcars
 conjurors nymphes changelings incubus robin-goodfellow
 the spoorne the mare the man in the oke the hell-waine
 the fier drake the puckle tom thombe hobgoblins tom
 tumbler boneless and such other bugs that we were afraid
 of our own shadowes


my route for a part of the way lay in sight of the avon which made
a variety of the most fancy doublings and windings through a wide and
fertile valley sometimes glittering from among willows which fringed
its borders sometimes disappearing among groves or beneath green banks
and sometimes rambling out into full view and making an azure sweep
round a slope of meadow-land this beautiful bosom of country is called
the vale of the red horse a distant line of undulating blue hills seems
to be its boundary whilst all the soft intervening landscape lies in a
manner enchained in the silver links of the avon

after pursuing the road for about three miles i turned off into a
footpath which led along the borders of fields and under hedgerows to a
private gate of the park there was a stile however for the benefit of
the pedestrian there being a public right of way through the grounds
i delight in these hospitable estates in which every one has a kind
of property at least as far as the footpath is concerned it in some
measure reconciles a poor man to his lot and what is more to the
better lot of his neighbor thus to have parks and pleasure-grounds
thrown open for his recreation he breathes the pure air as freely and
lolls as luxuriously under the shade as the lord of the soil and if he
has not the privilege of calling all that he sees his own he has not
at the same time the trouble of paying for it and keeping it in order

i now found myself among noble avenues of oaks and elms whose vast size
bespoke the growth of centuries the wind sounded solemnly among
their branches and the rooks cawed from their hereditary nests in the
tree-tops the eye ranged through a long lessening vista with nothing
to interrupt the view but a distant statue and a vagrant deer stalking
like a shadow across the opening

there is something about these stately old avenues that has the effect
of gothic architecture not merely from the pretended similarity of
form but from their bearing the evidence of long duration and of
having had their origin in a period of time with which we associate
ideas of romantic grandeur they betoken also the long-settled dignity
and proudly-concentrated independence of an ancient family and i have
heard a worthy but aristocratic old friend observe when speaking of the
sumptuous palaces of modern gentry that money could do much with
stone and mortar but thank heaven there was no such thing as suddenly
building up an avenue of oaks

it was from wandering in early life among this rich scenery and about
the romantic solitudes of the adjoining park of fullbroke which then
formed a part of the lucy estate that some of shakepeare's commentators
have supposed he derived his noble forest meditations of jaques and
the enchanting woodland pictures in as you like it it is in lonely
wanderings through such scenes that the mind drinks deep but quiet
draughts of inspiration and becomes intensely sensible of the beauty
and majesty of nature the imagination kindles into reverie and rapture
vague but exquisite images and ideas keep breaking upon it and we revel
in a mute and almost incommunicable luxury of thought it was in some
such mood and perhaps under one of those very trees before me which
threw their broad shades over the grassy banks and quivering waters of
the avon that the poet's fancy may have sallied forth into that little
song which breathes the very soul of a rural voluptuary

 unto the greenwood tree
 who loves to lie with me
 and tune his merry throat
 unto the sweet bird's note
 come hither come hither come hither
 here shall he see
 no enemy
 but winter and rough weather

i had now come in sight of the house it is a large building of brick
with stone quoins and is in the gothic style of queen elizabeth's day
having been built in the first year of her reign the exterior remains
very nearly in its original state and may be considered a fair specimen
of the residence of a wealthy country gentleman of those days a great
gateway opens from the park into a kind of courtyard in front of the
house ornamented with a grassplot shrubs and flower-beds the gateway
is in imitation of the ancient barbacan being a kind of outpost and
flanked by towers though evidently for mere ornament instead of
defence the front of the house is completely in the old style with
stone-shafted casements a great bow-window of heavy stone-work and a
portal with armorial bearings over it carved in stone at each corner
of the building is an octagon tower surmounted by a gilt ball and
weather-cock

the avon which winds through the park makes a bend just at the foot
of a gently-sloping bank which sweeps down from the rear of the house
large herds of deer were feeding or reposing upon its borders and
swans were sailing majestically upon its bosom as i contemplated the
venerable old mansion i called to mind falstaff's encomium on justice
shallow's abode and the affected indifference and real vanity of the
latter

falstaff you have a goodly dwelling and a rich shallow barren
barren barren beggars all beggars all sir john marry good air

whatever may have been the joviality of the old mansion in the days of
shakespeare it had now an air of stillness and solitude the great iron
gateway that opened into the courtyard was locked there was no show
of servants bustling about the place the deer gazed quietly at me as i
passed being no longer harried by the moss-troopers of stratford the
only sign of domestic life that i met with was a white cat stealing with
wary look and stealthy pace towards the stables as if on some nefarious
expedition i must not omit to mention the carcass of a scoundrel crow
which i saw suspended against the barn-wall as it shows that the lucys
still inherit that lordly abhorrence of poachers and maintain that
rigorous exercise of territorial power which was so strenuously
manifested in the case of the bard

after prowling about for some time i at length found my way to a
lateral portal which was the every-day entrance to the mansion i was
courteously received by a worthy old housekeeper who with the civility
and communicativeness of her order showed me the interior of the house
the greater part has undergone alterations and been adapted to modern
tastes and modes of living there is a fine old oaken staircase and the
great hall that noble feature in an ancient manor-house still retains
much of the appearance it must have had in the days of shakespeare the
ceiling is arched and lofty and at one end is a gallery in which stands
an organ the weapons and trophies of the chase which formerly adorned
the hall of a country gentleman have made way for family portraits
there is a wide hospitable fireplace calculated for an ample
old-fashioned wood fire formerly the rallying-place of winter
festivity on the opposite side of the hall is the huge gothic
bow-window with stone shafts which looks out upon the courtyard here
are emblazoned in stained glass the armorial bearings of the lucy family
for many generations some being dated in i was delighted to
observe in the quarterings the three white luces by which the character
of sir thomas was first identified with that of justice shallow they
are mentioned in the first scene of the merry wives of windsor where
the justice is in a rage with falstaff for having beaten his men
killed his deer and broken into his lodge the poet had no doubt the
offences of himself and his comrades in mind at the time and we may
suppose the family pride and vindictive threats of the puissant shallow
to be a caricature of the pompous indignation of sir thomas

shallow sir hugh persuade me not i will make a star chamber matter
of it if he were twenty john falstaffs he shall not abuse sir robert
shallow esq

slender in the county of gloster justice of peace and coram

shallow ay cousin slender and custalorum

slender ay and ratolorum too and a gentleman born master parson who
writes himself armigero in any bill warrant quittance or obligation
armigero

shallow ay that i do and have done any time these three hundred
years

slender all his successors gone before him have done't and all his
ancestors that come after him may they may give the dozen white luces
in their coat

shallow the council shall hear it it is a riot

evans it is not meet the council hear of a riot there is no fear of
got in a riot the council hear you shall desire to hear the fear of
got and not to hear a riot take your vizaments in that

shallow ha o my life if i were young again the sword should end
it

near the window thus emblazoned hung a portrait by sir peter lely
of one of the lucy family a great beauty of the time of charles
the second the old housekeeper shook her head as she pointed to the
picture and informed me that this lady had been sadly addicted to
cards and had gambled away a great portion of the family estate among
which was that part of the park where shakespeare and his comrades had
killed the deer the lands thus lost had not been entirely regained by
the family even at the present day it is but justice to this recreant
dame to confess that she had a surpassingly fine hand and arm

the picture which most attracted my attention was a great painting over
the fireplace containing likenesses of sir thomas lucy and his family
who inhabited the hall in the latter part of shakespeare's lifetime
i at first thought that it was the vindictive knight himself but the
housekeeper assured me that it was his son the only likeness extant
of the former being an effigy upon his tomb in the church of the
neighboring hamlet of charlecot


 this effigy is in white marble and represents the knight
 in complete armor near him lies the effigy of his wife and
 on her tomb is the following inscription which if really
 composed by her husband places him quite above the
 intellectual level of master shallow

 here lyeth the lady joyce lucy wife of sir thomas lucy of
 charlecot in ye county of warwick knight daughter and heir
 of thomas acton of sutton in ye county of worcester esquire
 who departed out of this wretched world to her heavenly
 kingdom ye day of february in ye yeare of our lord god
 and of her age and three all the time of her lyfe a
 true and faythful servant of her good god never detected of
 any cryme or vice in religion most sounde in love to her
 husband most faythful and true in friendship most constant
 to what in trust was committed unto her most secret in
 wisdom excelling in governing of her house bringing up of
 youth in ye fear of god that did converse with her moste
 rare and singular a great maintayner of hospitality
 greatly esteemed of her betters misliked of none unless of
 the envyous when all is spoken that can be saide a woman so
 garnished with virtue as not to be bettered and hardly to be
 equalled by any as shee lived most virtuotisly so shee died
 most godly set downe by him yt best did knowe what hath byn
 written to be true

 thomas lucye


the picture gives a lively idea of the costume and manners of the time
sir thomas is dressed in ruff and doublet white shoes with roses in
them and has a peaked yellow or as master slender would say a
cane-colored beard his lady is seated on the opposite side of the
picture in wide ruff and long stomacher and the children have a most
venerable stiffness and formality of dress hounds and spaniels are
mingled in the family group a hawk is seated on his perch in the
foreground and one of the children holds a bow all intimating the
knight's skill in hunting hawking and archery so indispensable to an
accomplished gentleman in those days


 bishop earle speaking of the country gentleman of his
 time observes his housekeeping is seen much in the
 different families of dogs and serving-men attendant on
 their kennels and the deepness of their throats is the
 depth of his discourse a hawk he esteems the true burden of
 nobility and is exceedingly ambitious to seem delighted
 with the sport and have his fist gloved with his jesses
 and gilpin in his description of a mr hastings remarks
 he kept all sorts of hounds that run buck fox hare
 otter and badger and had hawks of all kinds both long and
 short winged his great hall was commonly strewed with
 marrow-bones and full of hawk perches hounds spaniels
 and terriers on a broad hearth paved with brick lay some
 of the choicest terriers hounds and spaniels


i regretted to find that the ancient furniture of the hall had
disappeared for i had hoped to meet with the stately elbow-chair of
carved oak in which the country squire of former days was wont to sway
the sceptre of empire over his rural domains and in which it might be
presumed the redoubled sir thomas sat enthroned in awful state when
the recreant shakespeare was brought before him as i like to deck out
pictures for my own entertainment i pleased myself with the idea that
this very hall had been the scene of the unlucky bard's examination on
the morning after his captivity in the lodge i fancied to myself the
rural potentate surrounded by his body-guard of butler pages and
blue-coated serving-men with their badges while the luckless culprit
was brought in forlorn and chopfallen in the custody of gamekeepers
huntsmen and whippers-in and followed by a rabble rout of country
clowns i fancied bright faces of curious housemaids peeping from the
half-opened doors while from the gallery the fair daughters of the
knight leaned gracefully forward eyeing the youthful prisoner with that
pity that dwells in womanhood who would have thought that this poor
varlet thus trembling before the brief authority of a country squire
and the sport of rustic boors was soon to become the delight of
princes the theme of all tongues and ages the dictator to the human
mind and was to confer immortality on his oppressor by a caricature and
a lampoon

i was now invited by the butler to walk into the garden and i felt
inclined to visit the orchard and harbor where the justice treated sir
john falstaff and cousin silence to a last year's pippin of his own
grafting with a dish of caraways but i had already spent so much
of the day in my ramblings that i was obliged to give up any further
investigations when about to take my leave i was gratified by the
civil entreaties of the housekeeper and butler that i would take some
refreshment an instance of good old hospitality which i grieve to say
we castle-hunters seldom meet with in modern days i make no doubt it is
a virtue which the present representative of the lucys inherits from
his ancestors for shakespeare even in his caricature makes justice
shallow importunate in this respect as witness his pressing instances
to falstaff

by cock and pye sir you shall not away to-night i will not
excuse you you shall not be excused excuses shall not be admitted
there is no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused some
pigeons davy a couple of short-legged hens a joint of mutton and any
pretty little tiny kickshaws tell william cook

i now bade a reluctant farewell to the old hall my mind had become so
completely possessed by the imaginary scenes and characters connected
with it that i seemed to be actually living among them everything
brought them as it were before my eyes and as the door of the
dining-room opened i almost expected to hear the feeble voice of master
silence quavering forth his favorite ditty

 tis merry in hall when beards wag all
 and welcome merry shrove-tide

on returning to my inn i could not but reflect on the singular gift of
the poet to be able thus to spread the magic of his mind over the very
face of nature to give to things and places a charm and character
not their own and to turn this working-day world into a perfect
fairy-land he is indeed the true enchanter whose spell operates
not upon the senses but upon the imagination and the heart under the
wizard influence of shakespeare i had been walking all day in a complete
delusion i had surveyed the landscape through the prism of poetry
which tinged every object with the hues of the rainbow i had been
surrounded with fancied beings with mere airy nothings conjured up
by poetic power yet which to me had all the charm of reality i had
heard jaques soliloquize beneath his oak had beheld the fair rosalind
and her companion adventuring through the woodlands and above all
had been once more present in spirit with fat jack falstaff and his
contemporaries from the august justice shallow down to the gentle
master slender and the sweet anne page ten thousand honors and
blessings on the bard who has thus gilded the dull realities of life
with innocent illusions who has spread exquisite and unbought pleasures
in my chequered path and beguiled my spirit in many a lonely hour with
all the cordial and cheerful sympathies of social life

as i crossed the bridge over the avon on my return i paused to
contemplate the distant church in which the poet lies buried and could
not but exult in the malediction which has kept his ashes undisturbed
in its quiet and hallowed vaults what honor could his name have
derived from being mingled in dusty companionship with the epitaphs
and escutcheons and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude what would
a crowded corner in westminster abbey have been compared with this
reverend pile which seems to stand in beautiful loneliness as his sole
mausoleum the solitude about the grave may be but the offspring of
an overwrought sensibility but human nature is made up of foibles and
prejudices and its best and tenderest affections are mingled with these
factitious feelings he who has sought renown about the world and has
reaped a full harvest of worldly favor will find after all that there
is no love no admiration no applause so sweet to the soul as that
which springs up in his native place it is there that he seeks to be
gathered in peace and honor among his kindred and his early friends and
when the weary heart and failing head begin to warn him that the evening
of life is drawing on he turns as fondly as does the infant to
the mother's arms to sink to sleep in the bosom of the scene of his
childhood

how would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard when
wandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful world he cast back a heavy
look upon his paternal home could he have foreseen that before many
years he should return to it covered with renown that his name should
become the boast and glory of his native place that his ashes should
be religiously guarded as its most precious treasure and that its
lessening spire on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation
should one day become the beacon towering amidst the gentle landscape to
guide the literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb




traits of indian character

i appeal to any white man if ever he entered logan's cabin hungry and
he gave him not to eat if ever he came cold and naked and he clothed
him not speech of au indian chief

there is something in the character and habits of the north american
savage taken in connection with the scenery over which he is accustomed
to range its vast lakes boundless forests majestic rivers and
trackless plains that is to my mind wonderfully striking and sublime
he is formed for the wilderness as the arab is for the desert
his nature is stern simple and enduring fitted to grapple with
difficulties and to support privations there seems but little soil in
his heart for the support of the kindly virtues and yet if we would
but take the trouble to penetrate through that proud stoicism
and habitual taciturnity which lock up his character from casual
observation we should find him linked to his fellow-man of civilized
life by more of those sympathies and affections than are usually
ascribed to him

it has been the lot of the unfortunate aborigines of america in the
early periods of colonization to be doubly wronged by the white men
they have been dispossessed of their hereditary possessions by mercenary
and frequently wanton warfare and their characters have been traduced
by bigoted and interested writers the colonists often treated them like
beasts of the forest and the author has endeavored to justify him
in his outrages the former found it easier to exterminate than to
civilize the latter to vilify than to discriminate the appellations of
savage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities
of both and thus the poor wanderers of the forest were persecuted and
defamed not because they were guilty but because they were ignorant

the rights of the savage have seldom been properly appreciated or
respected by the white man in peace he has too often been the dupe of
artful traffic in war he has been regarded as a ferocious animal whose
life or death was a question of mere precaution and convenience man
is cruelly wasteful of life when his own safety is endangered and he is
sheltered by impunity and little mercy is to be expected from him
when he feels the sting of the reptile and is conscious of the power to
destroy

the same prejudices which were indulged thus early exist in common
circulation at the present day certain learned societies have it is
true with laudable diligence endeavored to investigate and record
the real characters and manners of the indian tribes the american
government too has wisely and humanely exerted itself to inculcate
a friendly and forbearing spirit towards them and to protect them from
fraud and injustice the current opinion of the indian character
however is too apt to be formed from the miserable hordes which infest
the frontiers and hang on the skirts of the settlements these are too
commonly composed of degenerate beings corrupted and enfeebled by the
vices of society without being benefited by its civilization that
proud independence which formed the main pillar of savage virtue has
been shaken down and the whole moral fabric lies in ruins their
spirits are humiliated and debased by a sense of inferiority and their
native courage cowed and daunted by the superior knowledge and power of
their enlightened neighbors society has advanced upon them like one of
those withering airs that will sometimes breed desolation over a whole
region of fertility it has enervated their strength multiplied their
diseases and superinduced upon their original barbarity the low vices
of artificial life it has given them a thousand superfluous wants
whilst it has diminished their means of mere existence it has driven
before it the animals of the chase who fly from the sound of the axe
and the smoke of the settlement and seek refuge in the depths of remoter
forests and yet untrodden wilds thus do we too often find the indians
on our frontiers to be the mere wrecks and remnants of once powerful
tribes who have lingered in the vicinity of the settlements and sunk
into precarious and vagabond existence poverty repining and hopeless
poverty a canker of the mind unknown in savage life corrodes their
spirits and blights every free and noble quality of their natures they
become drunken indolent feeble thievish and pusillanimous they
loiter like vagrants about the settlements among spacious dwellings
replete with elaborate comforts which only render them sensible of
the comparative wretchedness of their own condition luxury spreads its
ample board before their eyes but they are excluded from the banquet
plenty revels over the fields but they are starving in the midst of its
abundance the whole wilderness has blossomed into a garden but they
feel as reptiles that infest it


 the american government has been indefatigable in its
 exertions to ameliorate the situation of the indians and to
 introduce among them the arts of civilization and civil and
 religious knowledge to protect them from the frauds of the
 white traders no purchase of land from them by individuals
 is permitted nor is any person allowed to receive lands
 from them as a present without the express sanction of
 government these precautions are strictly enforced


how different was their state while yet the undisputed lords of the
soil their wants were few and the means of gratification within their
reach they saw every one round them sharing the same lot enduring the
same hardships feeding on the same aliments arrayed in the same rude
garments no roof then rose but was open to the homeless stranger no
smoke curled among the trees but he was welcome to sit down by its fire
and join the hunter in his repast for says an old historian of new
england their life is so void of care and they are so loving also
that they make use of those things they enjoy as common goods and are
therein so compassionate that rather than one should starve through
want they would starve all thus they pass their time merrily not
regarding our pomp but are better content with their own which some
men esteem so meanly of such were the indians whilst in the pride
and energy of their primitive natures they resembled those wild plants
which thrive best in the shades of the forest but shrink from the hand
of cultivation and perish beneath the influence of the sun

in discussing the savage character writers have been too prone to
indulge in vulgar prejudice and passionate exaggeration instead of the
candid temper of true philosophy they have not sufficiently considered
the peculiar circumstances in which the indians have been placed and
the peculiar principles under which they have been educated no being
acts more rigidly from rule than the indian his whole conduct is
regulated according to some general maxims early implanted in his mind
the moral laws that govern him are to be sure but few but then he
conforms to them all the white man abounds in laws of religion morals
and manners but how many does he violate

a frequent ground of accusation against the indians is their disregard
of treaties and the treachery and wantonness with which in time of
apparent peace they will suddenly fly to hostilities the intercourse
of the white men with the indians however is too apt to be cold
distrustful oppressive and insulting they seldom treat them with that
confidence and frankness which are indispensable to real friendship nor
is sufficient caution observed not to offend against those feelings of
pride or superstition which often prompt the indian to hostility
quicker than mere considerations of interest the solitary savage feels
silently but acutely his sensibilities are not diffused over so wide
a surface as those of the white man but they run in steadier and deeper
channels his pride his affections his superstitions are all
directed towards fewer objects but the wounds inflicted on them are
proportionably severe and furnish motives of hostility which we cannot
sufficiently appreciate where a community is also limited in number
and forms one great patriarchal family as in an indian tribe the
injury of an individual is the injury of the whole and the sentiment
of vengeance is almost instantaneously diffused one council-fire is
sufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a plan of hostilities
here all the fighting-men and sages assemble eloquence and superstition
combine to inflame the minds of the warriors the orator awakens
their martial ardor and they are wrought up to a kind of religious
desperation by the visions of the prophet and the dreamer

an instance of one of those sudden exasperations arising from a motive
peculiar to the indian character is extant in an old record of the
early settlement of massachusetts the planters of plymouth had defaced
the monuments of the dead at passonagessit and had plundered the grave
of the sachem's mother of some skins with which it had been decorated
the indians are remarkable for the reverence which they entertain for
the sepulchres of their kindred tribes that have passed generations
exiled from the abodes of their ancestors when by chance they have
been travelling in the vicinity have been known to turn aside from the
highway and guided by wonderfully accurate tradition have crossed the
country for miles to some tumulus buried perhaps in woods where the
bones of their tribe were anciently deposited and there have passed
hours in silent meditation influenced by this sublime and holy feeling
the sachem whose mother's tomb had been violated gathered his men
together and addressed them in the following beautifully simple
and pathetic harangue a curious specimen of indian eloquence and an
affecting instance of filial piety in a savage

when last the glorious light of all the sky was underneath this globe
and birds grew silent i began to settle as my custom is to take
repose before mine eyes were fast closed methought i saw a vision at
which my spirit was much troubled and trembling at that doleful sight
a spirit cried aloud behold my son whom i have cherished see the
breasts that gave thee suck the hands that lapped thee warm and fed
thee oft canst thou forget to take revenge of those wild people
who have defaced my monument in a despiteful manner disdaining our
antiquities and honorable customs see now the sachem's grave lies
like the common people defaced by an ignoble race thy mother doth
complain and implores thy aid against this thievish people who have
newly intruded on our land if this be suffered i shall not rest quiet
in my everlasting habitation this said the spirit vanished and i
all in a sweat not able scarce to speak began to get some strength
and recollect my spirits that were fled and determined to demand your
counsel and assistance

i have adduced this anecdote at some length as it tends to show how
these sudden acts of hostility which have been attributed to caprice
and perfidy may often arise from deep and generous motives which
our inattention to indian character and customs prevents our properly
appreciating

another ground of violent outcry against the indians is their barbarity
to the vanquished this had its origin partly in policy and partly in
superstition the tribes though sometimes called nations were never
so formidable in their numbers but that the loss of several warriors
was sensibly felt this was particularly the case when they had been
frequently engaged in warfare and many an instance occurs in indian
history where a tribe that had long been formidable to its neighbors
has been broken up and driven away by the capture and massacre of its
principal fighting-men there was a strong temptation therefore to the
victor to be merciless not so much to gratify any cruel revenge as
to provide for future security the indians had also the superstitious
belief frequent among barbarous nations and prevalent also among the
ancients that the manes of their friends who had fallen in battle were
soothed by the blood of the captives the prisoners however who are
not thus sacrificed are adopted into their families in the place of the
slain and are treated with the confidence and affection of relatives
and friends nay so hospitable and tender is their entertainment that
when the alternative is offered them they will often prefer to remain
with their adopted brethren rather than return to the home and the
friends of their youth

the cruelty of the indians towards their prisoners has been heightened
since the colonization of the whites what was formerly a compliance
with policy and superstition has been exasperated into a gratification
of vengeance they cannot but be sensible that the white men are the
usurpers of their ancient dominion the cause of their degradation and
the gradual destroyers of their race they go forth to battle smarting
with injuries and indignities which they have individually suffered and
they are driven to madness and despair by the wide-spreading desolation
and the overwhelming ruin of european warfare the whites have too
frequently set them an example of violence by burning their villages
and laying waste their slender means of subsistence and yet they wonder
that savages do not show moderation and magnanimity towards those who
have left them nothing but mere existence and wretchedness

we stigmatize the indians also as cowardly and treacherous because
they use stratagem in warfare in preference to open force but in this
they are fully justified by their rude code of honor they are early
taught that stratagem is praiseworthy the bravest warrior thinks it
no disgrace to lurk in silence and take every advantage of his foe he
triumphs in the superior craft and sagacity by which he has been enabled
to surprise and destroy an enemy indeed man is naturally more prone to
subtilty than open valor owing to his physical weakness in comparison
with other animals they are endowed with natural weapons of defence
with horns with tusks with hoofs and talons but man has to depend
on his superior sagacity in all his encounters with these his proper
enemies he resorts to stratagem and when he perversely turns his
hostility against his fellow-man he at first continues the same subtle
mode of warfare

the natural principle of war is to do the most harm to our enemy with
the least harm to ourselves and this of course is to be effected by
stratagem that chivalrous courage which induces us to despise the
suggestions of prudence and to rush in the face of certain danger is the
offspring of society and produced by education it is honorable
because it is in fact the triumph of lofty sentiment over an instinctive
repugnance to pain and over those yearnings after personal ease and
security which society has condemned as ignoble it is kept alive by
pride and the fear of shame and thus the dread of real evil is overcome
by the superior dread of an evil which exists but in the imagination it
has been cherished and stimulated also by various means it has been
the theme of spirit-stirring song and chivalrous story the poet and
minstrel have delighted to shed round it the splendors of fiction and
even the historian has forgotten the sober gravity of narration and
broken forth into enthusiasm and rhapsody in its praise triumphs and
gorgeous pageants have been its reward monuments on which art has
exhausted its skill and opulence its treasures have been erected
to perpetuate a nation's gratitude and admiration thus artificially
excited courage has risen to an extraordinary and factitious degree
of heroism and arrayed in all the glorious pomp and circumstance of
war this turbulent quality has even been able to eclipse many of those
quiet but invaluable virtues which silently ennoble the human character
and swell the tide of human happiness

but if courage intrinsically consists in the defiance of danger and
pain the life of the indian is a continual exhibition of it he lives
in a state of perpetual hostility and risk peril and adventure
are congenial to his nature or rather seem necessary to arouse his
faculties and to give an interest to his existence surrounded by
hostile tribes whose mode of warfare is by ambush and surprisal he is
always prepared for fight and lives with his weapons in his hands as
the ship careers in fearful singleness through the solitudes of ocean
as the bird mingles among clouds and storms and wings its way a
mere speck across the pathless fields of air so the indian holds his
course silent solitary but undaunted through the boundless bosom of
the wilderness his expeditions may vie in distance and danger with
the pilgrimage of the devotee or the crusade of the knight-errant he
traverses vast forests exposed to the hazards of lonely sickness of
lurking enemies and pining famine stormy lakes those great inland
seas are no obstacles to his wanderings in his light canoe of bark he
sports like a feather on their waves and darts with the swiftness of
an arrow down the roaring rapids of the rivers his very subsistence
is snatched from the midst of toil and peril he gains his food by the
hardships and dangers of the chase he wraps himself in the spoils of
the bear the panther and the buffalo and sleeps among the thunders of
the cataract

no hero of ancient or modern days can surpass the indian in his lofty
contempt of death and the fortitude with which he sustains his cruelest
affliction indeed we here behold him rising superior to the white man
in consequence of his peculiar education the latter rushes to glorious
death at the cannon's mouth the former calmly contemplates its
approach and triumphantly endures it amidst the varied torments of
surrounding foes and the protracted agonies of fire he even takes
a pride in taunting his persecutors and provoking their ingenuity of
torture and as the devouring flames prey on his very vitals and the
flesh shrinks from the sinews he raises his last song of triumph
breathing the defiance of an unconquered heart and invoking the spirits
of his fathers to witness that he dies without a groan

notwithstanding the obloquy with which the early historians have
overshadowed the characters of the unfortunate natives some bright
gleams occasionally break through which throw a degree of melancholy
lustre on their memories facts are occasionally to be met with in the
rude annals of the eastern provinces which though recorded with the
coloring of prejudice and bigotry yet speak for themselves and will
be dwelt on with applause and sympathy when prejudice shall have passed
away

in one of the homely narratives of the indian wars in new england there
is a touching account of the desolation carried into the tribe of
the pequod indians humanity shrinks from the cold-blooded detail of
indiscriminate butchery in one place we read of the surprisal of an
indian fort in the night when the wigwams were wrapped in flames and
the miserable inhabitants shot down and slain in attempting to escape
all being despatched and ended in the course of an hour after a
series of similar transactions our soldiers as the historian
piously observes being resolved by god's assistance to make a final
destruction of them the unhappy savages being hunted from their homes
and fortresses and pursued with fire and sword a scanty but gallant
band the sad remnant of the pequod warriors with their wives and
children took refuge in a swamp

burning with indignation and rendered sullen by despair with hearts
bursting with grief at the destruction of their tribe and spirits
galled and sore at the fancied ignominy of their defeat they refused to
ask their lives at the hands of an insulting foe and preferred death to
submission

as the night drew on they were surrounded in their dismal retreat so as
to render escape impracticable thus situated their enemy plied them
with shot all the time by which means many were killed and buried in
the mire in the darkness and fog that preceded the dawn of day some
few broke through the besiegers and escaped into the woods the rest
were left to the conquerors of which many were killed in the swamp
like sullen dogs who would rather in their self-willedness and madness
sit still and be shot through or cut to pieces than implore for mercy
when the day broke upon this handful of forlorn but dauntless spirits
the soldiers we are told entering the swamp saw several heaps of
them sitting close together upon whom they discharged their pieces
laden with ten or twelve pistol bullets at a time putting the muzzles
of the pieces under the boughs within a few yards of them so as
besides those that were found dead many more were killed and sunk into
the mire and never were minded more by friend or foe

can any one read this plain unvarnished tale without admiring the stern
resolution the unbending pride the loftiness of spirit that seemed to
nerve the hearts of these self-taught heroes and to raise them above the
instinctive feelings of human nature when the gauls laid waste the city
of rome they found the senators clothed in their robes and seated with
stern tranquillity in their curule chairs in this manner they suffered
death without resistance or even supplication such conduct was in them
applauded as noble and magnanimous in the hapless indian it was
reviled as obstinate and sullen how truly are we the dupes of show and
circumstance how different is virtue clothed in purple and enthroned
in state from virtue naked and destitute and perishing obscurely in a
wilderness

but i forbear to dwell on these gloomy pictures the eastern tribes have
long since disappeared the forests that sheltered them have been laid
low and scarce any traces remain of them in the thickly-settled states
of new england excepting here and there the indian name of a village
or a stream and such must sooner or later be the fate of those other
tribes which skirt the frontiers and have occasionally been inveigled
from their forests to mingle in the wars of white men in a little
while and they will go the way that their brethren have gone before
the few hordes which still linger about the shores of huron and superior
and the tributary streams of the mississippi will share the fate of
those tribes that once spread over massachusetts and connecticut and
lorded it along the proud banks of the hudson of that gigantic race
said to have existed on the borders of the susquehanna and of those
various nations that flourished about the potomac and the rappahannock
and that peopled the forests of the vast valley of shenandoah they will
vanish like a vapor from the face of the earth their very history will
be lost in forgetfulness and the places that now know them will know
them no more forever or if perchance some dubious memorial of them
should survive it may be in the romantic dreams of the poet to people
in imagination his glades and groves like the fauns and satyrs and
sylvan deities of antiquity but should he venture upon the dark story
of their wrongs and wretchedness should he tell how they were invaded
corrupted despoiled driven from their native abodes and the sepulchres
of their fathers hunted like wild beasts about the earth and sent down
with violence and butchery to the grave posterity will either turn with
horror and incredulity from the tale or blush with indignation at the
inhumanity of their forefathers we are driven back said an old
warrior until we can retreat no farther our hatchets are broken our
bows are snapped our fires are nearly extinguished a little longer and
the white man will cease to persecute us for we shall cease to exist

it is to be regretted that those early writers who treated of the
discovery and settlement of america have not given us more particular
and candid accounts of the remarkable characters that flourished in
savage life the scanty anecdotes which have reached us are full of
peculiarity and interest they furnish us with nearer glimpses of human
nature and show what man is in a comparatively primitive state and what
he owes to civilization there is something of the charm of discovery
in lighting upon these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature in
witnessing as it were the native growth of moral sentiment and
perceiving those generous and romantic qualities which have been
artificially cultivated by society vegetating in spontaneous hardihood
and rude magnificence

in civilized life where the happiness and indeed almost the existence
of man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow-men he is
constantly acting a studied part the bold and peculiar traits of native
character are refined away or softened down by the levelling influence
of what is termed good-breeding and he practises so many petty
deceptions and affects so many generous sentiments for the purposes
of popularity that it is difficult to distinguish his real from his
artificial character the indian on the contrary free from the
restraints and refinements of polished life and in a great degree a
solitary and independent being obeys the impulses of his inclination
or the dictates of his judgment and thus the attributes of his nature
being freely indulged grow singly great and striking society is like
a lawn where every roughness is smoothed every bramble eradicated and
where the eye is delighted by the smiling verdure of a velvet surface
he however who would study nature in its wildness and variety must
plunge into the forest must explore the glen must stem the torrent
and dare the precipice

these reflections arose on casually looking through a volume of early
colonial history wherein are recorded with great bitterness the
outrages of the indians and their wars with the settlers new england
it is painful to perceive even from these partial narratives how the
footsteps of civilization may be traced in the blood of the aborigines
how easily the colonists were moved to hostility by the lust of
conquest how merciless and exterminating was their warfare the
imagination shrinks at the idea of how many intellectual beings were
hunted from the earth how many brave and noble hearts of nature's
sterling coinage were broken down and trampled in the dust

such was the fate of philip of pokanoket an indian warrior whose name
was once a terror throughout massachusetts and connecticut he was the
most distinguished of a number of contemporary sachems who reigned over
the pequods the narragansetts the wampanoags and the other eastern
tribes at the time of the first settlement of new england a band of
native untaught heroes who made the most generous struggle of which
human nature is capable fighting to the last gasp in the cause of their
country without a hope of victory or a thought of renown worthy of
an age of poetry and fit subjects for local story and romantic fiction
they have left scarcely any authentic traces on the page of history but
stalk like gigantic shadows in the dim twilight of tradition


 while correcting the proof-sheets of this article the
 author is informed that a celebrated english poet has nearly
 finished an heroic poem on the story of philip of pokanoket


when the pilgrims as the plymouth settlers are called by their
descendants first took refuge on the shores of the new world from
the religious persecutions of the old their situation was to the last
degree gloomy and disheartening few in number and that number rapidly
perishing away through sickness and hardships surrounded by a howling
wilderness and savage tribes exposed to the rigors of an almost arctic
winter and the vicissitudes of an ever-shifting climate their minds
were filled with doleful forebodings and nothing preserved them
from sinking into despondency but the strong excitement of religious
enthusiasm in this forlorn situation they were visited by massasoit
chief sagamore of the wampanoags a powerful chief who reigned over
a great extent of country instead of taking advantage of the scanty
number of the strangers and expelling them from his territories into
which they had intruded he seemed at once to conceive for them a
generous friendship and extended towards them the rites of primitive
hospitality he came early in the spring to their settlement of new
plymouth attended by a mere handful of followers entered into a solemn
league of peace and amity sold them a portion of the soil and promised
to secure for them the good-will of his savage allies whatever may be
said of indian perfidy it is certain that the integrity and good
faith of massasoit have never been impeached he continued a firm and
magnanimous friend of the white men suffering them to extend their
possessions and to strengthen themselves in the land and betraying no
jealousy of their increasing power and prosperity shortly before his
death he came once more to new plymouth with his son alexander for
the purpose of renewing the covenant of peace and of securing it to his
posterity

at this conference he endeavored to protect the religion of his
forefathers from the encroaching zeal of the missionaries and
stipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his people
from their ancient faith but finding the english obstinately opposed
to any such condition he mildly relinquished the demand almost the
last act of his life was to bring his two sons alexander and philip
as they had been named by the english to the residence of a principal
settler recommending mutual kindness and confidence and entreating
that the same love and amity which had existed between the white men and
himself might be continued afterwards with his children the good old
sachem died in peace and was happily gathered to his fathers before
sorrow came upon his tribe his children remained behind to experience
the ingratitude of white men

his eldest son alexander succeeded him he was of a quick and
impetuous temper and proudly tenacious of his hereditary rights and
dignity the intrusive policy and dictatorial conduct of the
strangers excited his indignation and he beheld with uneasiness their
exterminating wars with the neighboring tribes he was doomed soon to
incur their hostility being accused of plotting with the narragansetts
to rise against the english and drive them from the land it is
impossible to say whether this accusation was warranted by facts or was
grounded on mere suspicions it is evident however by the violent and
overbearing measures of the settlers that they had by this time begun to
feel conscious of the rapid increase of their power and to grow harsh
and inconsiderate in their treatment of the natives they despatched
an armed force to seize upon alexander and to bring him before their
courts he was traced to his woodland haunts and surprised at a
hunting-house where he was reposing with a band of his followers
unarmed after the toils of the chase the suddenness of his arrest
and the outrage offered to his sovereign dignity so preyed upon the
irascible feelings of this proud savage as to throw him into a raging
fever he was permitted to return home on condition of sending his son
as a pledge for his re-appearance but the blow he had received was
fatal and before he reached his home he fell a victim to the agonies of
a wounded spirit

the successor of alexander was metamocet or king philip as he was
called by the settlers on account of his lofty spirit and ambitious
temper these together with his well-known energy and enterprise had
rendered him an object of great jealousy and apprehension and he was
accused of having always cherished a secret and implacable hostility
towards the whites such may very probably and very naturally have been
the case he considered them as originally but mere intruders into
the country who had presumed upon indulgence and were extending
an influence baneful to savage life he saw the whole race of his
countrymen melting before them from the face of the earth their
territories slipping from their hands and their tribes becoming feeble
scattered and dependent it may be said that the soil was originally
purchased by the settlers but who does not know the nature of indian
purchases in the early periods of colonization the europeans always
made thrifty bargains through their superior adroitness in traffic and
they gained vast accessions of territory by easily-provoked hostilities
an uncultivated savage is never a nice inquirer into the refinements of
law by which an injury may be gradually and legally inflicted leading
facts are all by which he judges and it was enough for philip to know
that before the intrusion of the europeans his countrymen were lords of
the soil and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their
fathers

but whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility and his
particular indignation at the treatment of his brother he suppressed
them for the present renewed the contract with the settlers and
resided peaceably for many years at pokanoket or as it was called by
the english mount hope the ancient seat of dominion of his tribe
suspicions however which were at first but vague and indefinite
began to acquire form and substance and he was at length charged with
attempting to instigate the various eastern tribes to rise at once and
by a simultaneous effort to throw off the yoke of their oppressors it
is difficult at this distant period to assign the proper credit due to
these early accusations against the indians there was a proneness to
suspicion and an aptness to acts of violence on the part of the whites
that gave weight and importance to every idle tale informers abounded
where tale-bearing met with countenance and reward and the sword
was readily unsheathed when its success was certain and it carved out
empire


 now bristol rhode island


the only positive evidence on record against philip is the accusation
of one sausaman a renegado indian whose natural cunning had been
quickened by a partial education which he had received among the
settlers he changed his faith and his allegiance two or three times
with a facility that evinced the looseness of his principles he had
acted for some time as philip's confidential secretary and counsellor
and had enjoyed his bounty and protection finding however that the
clouds of adversity were gathering round his patron he abandoned his
service and went over to the whites and in order to gain their favor
charged his former benefactor with plotting against their safety a
rigorous investigation took place philip and several of his subjects
submitted to be examined but nothing was proved against them the
settlers however had now gone too far to retract they had previously
determined that philip was a dangerous neighbor they had publicly
evinced their distrust and had done enough to insure his hostility
according therefore to the usual mode of reasoning in these cases
his destruction had become necessary to their security sausaman the
treacherous informer was shortly afterwards found dead in a pond
having fallen a victim to the vengeance of his tribe three indians
one of whom was a friend and counsellor of philip were apprehended
and tried and on the testimony of one very questionable witness were
condemned and executed as murderers

this treatment of his subjects and ignominious punishment of his friend
outraged the pride and exasperated the passions of philip the bolt
which had fallen thus at his very feet awakened him to the gathering
storm and he determined to trust himself no longer in the power of the
white men the fate of his insulted and broken-hearted brother still
rankled in his mind and he had a further warning in the tragical story
of miantonimo a great sachem of the narragansetts who after manfully
facing his accusers before a tribunal of the colonists exculpating
himself from a charge of conspiracy and receiving assurances of amity
had been perfidiously despatched at their instigation philip therefore
gathered his fighting-men about him persuaded all strangers that
he could to join his cause sent the women and children to the
narragansetts for safety and wherever he appeared was continually
surrounded by armed warriors

when the two parties were thus in a state of distrust and irritation
the least spark was sufficient to set them in a flame the indians
having weapons in their hands grew mischievous and committed various
petty depredations in one of their maraudings a warrior was fired on
and killed by a settler this was the signal for open hostilities the
indians pressed to revenge the death of their comrade and the alarm of
war resounded through the plymouth colony

in the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we meet with
many indications of the diseased state of the public mind the gloom
of religious abstraction and the wildness of their situation among
trackless forests and savage tribes had disposed the colonists to
superstitious fancies and had filled their imaginations with the
frightful chimeras of witchcraft and spectrology they were much given
also to a belief in omens the troubles with philip and his indians
were preceded we are told by a variety of those awful warnings which
forerun great and public calamities the perfect form of an indian
bow appeared in the air at new plymouth which was looked upon by the
inhabitants as a prodigious apparition at hadley northampton and
other towns in their neighborhood was heard the report of a great piece
of ordnance with a shaking of the earth and a considerable echo
others were alarmed on a still sunshiny morning by the discharge of guns
and muskets bullets seemed to whistle past them and the noise of
drums resounded in the air seeming to pass away to the westward others
fancied that they heard the galloping of horses over their heads and
certain monstrous births which took place about the time filled the
superstitious in some towns with doleful forebodings many of these
portentous sights and sounds may be ascribed to natural phenomena to
the northern lights which occur vividly in those latitudes the meteors
which explode in the air the casual rushing of a blast through the top
branches of the forest the crash of fallen trees or disrupted rocks
and to those other uncouth sounds and echoes which will sometimes
strike the ear so strangely amidst the profound stillness of woodland
solitudes these may have startled some melancholy imaginations may
have been exaggerated by the love for the marvellous and listened
to with that avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and
mysterious the universal currency of these superstitious fancies and
the grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day are
strongly characteristic of the times


 the rev increase mather's history


the nature of the contest that ensued was such as too often
distinguishes the warfare between civilized men and savages on the part
of the whites it was conducted with superior skill and success but with
a wastefulness of the blood and a disregard of the natural rights of
their antagonists on the part of the indians it was waged with the
desperation of men fearless of death and who had nothing to expect from
peace but humiliation dependence and decay

the events of the war are transmitted to us by a worthy clergyman of the
time who dwells with horror and indignation on every hostile act of the
indians however justifiable whilst he mentions with applause the most
sanguinary atrocities of the whites philip is reviled as a murderer and
a traitor without considering that he was a true-born prince gallantly
fighting at the head of his subjects to avenge the wrongs of his family
to retrieve the tottering power of his line and to deliver his native
land from the oppression of usurping strangers

the project of a wide and simultaneous revolt if such had really been
formed was worthy of a capacious mind and had it not been prematurely
discovered might have been overwhelming in its consequences the war
that actually broke out was but a war of detail a mere succession of
casual exploits and unconnected enterprises still it sets forth the
military genius and daring prowess of philip and wherever in the
prejudiced and passionate narrations that have been given of it we
can arrive at simple facts we find him displaying a vigorous mind a
fertility of expedients a contempt of suffering and hardship and an
unconquerable resolution that command our sympathy and applause

driven from his paternal domains at mount hope he threw himself
into the depths of those vast and trackless forests that skirted the
settlements and were almost impervious to anything but a wild beast
or an indian here he gathered together his forces like the storm
accumulating its stores of mischief in the bosom of the thundercloud
and would suddenly emerge at a time and place least expected carrying
havoc and dismay into the villages there were now and then indications
of these impending ravages that filled the minds of the colonists with
awe and apprehension the report of a distant gun would perhaps be heard
from the solitary woodland where there was known to be no white man
the cattle which had been wandering in the woods would sometimes return
home wounded or an indian or two would be seen lurking about the
skirts of the forests and suddenly disappearing as the lightning will
sometimes be seen playing silently about the edge of the cloud that is
brewing up the tempest

though sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the settlers yet philip
as often escaped almost miraculously from their toils and plunging
into the wilderness would be lost to all search or inquiry until he
again emerged at some far distant quarter laying the country desolate
among his strongholds were the great swamps or morasses which extend
in some parts of new england composed of loose bogs of deep black
mud perplexed with thickets brambles rank weeds the shattered and
mouldering trunks of fallen trees overshadowed by lugubrious hemlocks
the uncertain footing and the tangled mazes of these shaggy wilds
rendered them almost impracticable to the white man though the indian
could thread their labyrinths with the agility of a deer into one of
these the great swamp of pocasset neck was philip once driven with a
band of his followers the english did not dare to pursue him fearing
to venture into these dark and frightful recesses where they might
perish in fens and miry pits or be shot down by lurking foes they
therefore invested the entrance to the neck and began to build a fort
with the thought of starving out the foe but philip and his warriors
wafted themselves on a raft over an arm of the sea in the dead of night
leaving the women and children behind and escaped away to the westward
kindling the flames of war among the tribes of massachusetts and the
nipmuck country and threatening the colony of connecticut

in this way philip became a theme of universal apprehension the mystery
in which he was enveloped exaggerated his real terrors he was an evil
that walked in darkness whose coming none could foresee and against
which none knew when to be on the alert the whole country abounded with
rumors and alarms philip seemed almost possessed of ubiquity for in
whatever part of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the
forest took place philip was said to be its leader many superstitious
notions also were circulated concerning him he was said to deal in
necromancy and to be attended by an old indian witch or prophetess
whom he consulted and who assisted him by her charms and incantations
this indeed was frequently the case with indian chiefs either through
their own credulity or to act upon that of their followers and the
influence of the prophet and the dreamer over indian superstition has
been fully evidenced in recent instances of savage warfare

at the time that philip effected his escape from pocasset his fortunes
were in a desperate condition his forces had been thinned by repeated
fights and he had lost almost the whole of his resources in this time
of adversity he found a faithful friend in canonchet chief sachem of
all the narragansetts he was the son and heir of miantonimo the great
sachem who as already mentioned after an honorable acquittal of the
charge of conspiracy had been privately put to death at the perfidious
instigations of the settlers he was the heir says the old
chronicler of all his father's pride and insolence as well as of his
malice towards the english he certainly was the heir of his insults
and injuries and the legitimate avenger of his murder though he had
forborne to take an active part in this hopeless war yet he received
philip and his broken forces with open arms and gave them the most
generous countenance and support this at once drew upon him the
hostility of the english and it was determined to strike a signal blow
that should involve both the sachems in one common ruin a great force
was therefore gathered together from massachusetts plymouth and
connecticut and was sent into the narragansett country in the depth of
winter when the swamps being frozen and leafless could be traversed
with comparative facility and would no longer afford dark and
impenetrable fastnesses to the indians

apprehensive of attack canonchet had conveyed the greater part of his
stores together with the old the infirm the women and children of his
tribe to a strong fortress where he and philip had likewise drawn
up the flower of their forces this fortress deemed by the indians
impregnable was situated upon a rising mound or kind of island of five
or six acres in the midst of a swamp it was constructed with a degree
of judgment and skill vastly superior to what is usually displayed in
indian fortification and indicative of the martial genius of these two
chieftains

guided by a renegado indian the english penetrated through december
snows to this stronghold and came upon the garrison by surprise the
fight was fierce and tumultuous the assailants were repulsed in their
first attack and several of their bravest officers were shot down in
the act of storming the fortress sword in hand the assault was renewed
with greater success a lodgment was effected the indians were driven
from one post to another they disputed their ground inch by inch
fighting with the fury of despair most of their veterans were cut to
pieces and after a long and bloody battle philip and canonchet with
a handful of surviving warriors retreated from the fort and took refuge
in the thickets of the surrounding forest

the victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort the whole was soon in
a blaze many of the old men the women and the children perished in
the flames this last outrage overcame even the stoicism of the savage
the neighboring woods resounded with the yells of rage and despair
uttered by the fugitive warriors as they beheld the destruction
of their dwellings and heard the agonizing cries of their wives and
offspring the burning of the wigwams says a contemporary writer
the shrieks and cries of the women and children and the yelling of
the warriors exhibited a most horrible and affecting scene so that it
greatly moved some of the soldiers the same writer cautiously adds
they were in much doubt then and afterwards seriously inquired
whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with humanity
and the benevolent principles of the gospel


 ms of the rev w ruggles


the fate of the brave and generous canonchet is worthy of particular
mention the last scene of his life is one of the noblest instances on
record of indian magnanimity

broken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat yet
faithful to his ally and to the hapless cause which he had espoused he
rejected all overtures of peace offered on condition of betraying philip
and his followers and declared that he would fight it out to the
last man rather than become a servant to the english his home being
destroyed his country harassed and laid waste by the incursions of
the conquerors he was obliged to wander away to the banks of the
connecticut where he formed a rallying-point to the whole body of
western indians and laid waste several of the english settlements

early in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition with only
thirty chosen men to penetrate to seaconck in the vicinity of mount
hope and to procure seed corn to plant for the sustenance of his
troops this little hand of adventurers had passed safely through the
pequod country and were in the centre of the narragansett resting
at some wigwams near pautucket river when an alarm was given of an
approaching enemy having but seven men by him at the time canonchet
despatched two of them to the top of a neighboring hill to bring
intelligence of the foe

panic-struck by the appearance of a troop of english and indians rapidly
advancing they fled in breathless terror past their chieftain without
stopping to inform him of the danger canonchet sent another scout
who did the same he then sent two more one of whom hurrying back
in confusion and affright told him that the whole british army was
at hand canonchet saw there was no choice but immediate flight he
attempted to escape round the hill but was perceived and hotly pursued
by the hostile indians and a few of the fleetest of the english finding
the swiftest pursuer close upon his heels he threw off first his
blanket then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag by which his
enemies knew him to be canonchet and redoubled the eagerness of pursuit

at length in dashing through the river his foot slipped upon a stone
and he fell so deep as to wet his gun this accident so struck him with
despair that as he afterwards confessed his heart and his bowels
turned within him and he became like a rotten stick void of strength

to such a degree was he unnerved that being seized by a pequod indian
within a short distance of the river he made no resistance though
a man of great vigor of body and boldness of heart but on being made
prisoner the whole pride of his spirit arose within him and from that
moment we find in the anecdotes given by his enemies nothing but
repeated flashes of elevated and prince-like heroism being questioned
by one of the english who first came up with him and who had not
attained his twenty second year the proud-hearted warrior looking
with lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance replied you are a
child you cannot understand matters of war let your brother or your
chief come him will i answer

though repeated offers were made to him of his life on condition of
submitting with his nation to the english yet he rejected them with
disdain and refused to send any proposals of the kind to the great body
of his subjects saying that he knew none of them would comply being
reproached with his breach of faith towards the whites his boast that
he would not deliver up a wampanoag nor the paring of a wampanoag's
nail and his threat that he would burn the english alive in their
houses he disdained to justify himself haughtily answering that others
were as forward for the war as himself and he desired to hear no more
thereof

so noble and unshaken a spirit so true a fidelity to his cause and his
friend might have touched the feelings of the generous and the brave
but canonchet was an indian a being towards whom war had no courtesy
humanity no law religion no compassion he was condemned to die the
last words of his that are recorded are worthy the greatness of his
soul when sentence of death was passed upon him he observed that he
liked it well for he should die before his heart was soft or he had
spoken anything unworthy of himself his enemies gave him the death of
a soldier for he was shot at stoning ham by three young sachems of his
own rank

the defeat at the narraganset fortress and the death of canonchet were
fatal blows to the fortunes of king philip he made an ineffectual
attempt to raise a head of war by stirring up the mohawks to take arms
but though possessed of the native talents of a statesman his arts
were counteracted by the superior arts of his enlightened enemies and
the terror of their warlike skill began to subdue the resolution of the
neighboring tribes the unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped
of power and his ranks rapidly thinning around him some were suborned
by the whites others fell victims to hunger and fatigue and to the
frequent attacks by which they were harassed his stores were all
captured his chosen friends were swept away from before his eyes his
uncle was shot down by his side his sister was carried into captivity
and in one of his narrow escapes he was compelled to leave his beloved
wife and only son to the mercy of the enemy his ruin says the
historian being thus gradually carried on his misery was not
prevented but augmented thereby being himself made acquainted with the
sense and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children loss of
friends slaughter of his subjects bereavement of all family relations
and being stripped of all outward comforts before his own life should be
taken away

to fill up the measure of his misfortunes his own followers began
to plot against his life that by sacrificing him they might purchase
dishonorable safety through treachery a number of his faithful
adherents the subjects of wetamoe an indian princess of pocasset a
near kinswoman and confederate of philip were betrayed into the hands
of the enemy wetamoe was among them at the time and attempted to make
her escape by crossing a neighboring river either exhausted by swimming
or starved with cold and hunger she was found dead and naked near the
water-side but persecution ceased not at the grave even death the
refuge of the wretched where the wicked commonly cease from troubling
was no protection to this outcast female whose great crime was
affectionate fidelity to her kinsman and her friend her corpse was the
object of unmanly and dastardly vengeance the head was severed from the
body and set upon a pole and was thus exposed at taunton to the view of
her captive subjects they immediately recognized the features of their
unfortunate queen and were so affected at this barbarous spectacle
that we are told they broke forth into the most horrid and diabolical
lamentations

however philip had borne up against the complicated miseries and
misfortunes that surrounded him the treachery of his followers seemed
to wring his heart and reduce him to despondency it is said that he
never rejoiced afterwards nor had success in any of his designs the
spring of hope was broken the ardor of enterprise was extinguished he
looked around and all was danger and darkness there was no eye to
pity nor any arm that could bring deliverance with a scanty band
of followers who still remained true to his desperate fortunes the
unhappy philip wandered back to the vicinity of mount hope the ancient
dwelling of his fathers here he lurked about like a spectre among the
scenes of former power and prosperity now bereft of home of family
and of friend there needs no better picture of his destitute and
piteous situation than that furnished by the homely pen of the
chronicler who is unwarily enlisting the feelings of the reader in
favor of the hapless warrior whom he reviles philip he says like a
savage wild beast having been hunted by the english forces through the
woods above a hundred miles backward and forward at last was driven to
his own den upon mount hope where he retired with a few of his best
friends into a swamp which proved but a prison to keep him fast till
the messengers of death came by divine permission to execute vengeance
upon him

even in this last refuge of desperation and despair a sullen grandeur
gathers round his memory we picture him to ourselves seated among his
care-worn followers brooding in silence over his blasted fortunes and
acquiring a savage sublimity from the wildness and dreariness of his
lurking-place defeated but not dismayed crushed to the earth but
not humiliated he seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster and
to experience a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of
bitterness little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune but great
minds rise above it the very idea of submission awakened the fury
of philip and he smote to death one of his followers who proposed an
expedient of peace the brother of the victim made his escape and in
revenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain a body of white men
and indians were immediately despatched to the swamp where philip lay
crouched glaring with fury and despair before he was aware of their
approach they had begun to surround him in a little while he saw five
of his trustiest followers laid dead at his feet all resistance was
vain he rushed forth from his covert and made a headlong attempt to
escape but was shot through the heart by a renegado indian of his own
nation

such is the scanty story of the brave but unfortunate king philip
persecuted while living slandered and dishonored when dead if
however we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes furnished us by his
enemies we may perceive in them traces of amiable and lofty character
sufficient to awaken sympathy for his fate and respect for his memory
we find that amidst all the harassing cares and ferocious passions of
constant warfare he was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love
and paternal tenderness and to the generous sentiment of friendship
the captivity of his beloved wife and only son are mentioned with
exultation as causing him poignant misery the death of any near friend
is triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities but the
treachery and desertion of many of his followers in whose affections he
had confided is said to have desolated his heart and to have bereaved
him of all further comfort he was a patriot attached to his native
soil a prince true to his subjects and indignant of their wrongs a
soldier daring in battle firm in adversity patient of fatigue of
hunger of every variety of bodily suffering and ready to perish in
the cause he had espoused proud of heart and with an untamable love
of natural liberty he preferred to enjoy it among the beasts of the
forests or in the dismal and famished recesses of swamps and morasses
rather than bow his haughty spirit to submission and live dependent
and despised in the ease and luxury of the settlements with heroic
qualities and bold achievements that would have graced a civilized
warrior and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian
he lived a wanderer and a fugitive in his native land and went down
like a lonely bark foundering amid darkness and tempest without a
pitying eye to weep his fall or a friendly hand to record his struggle




john bull

 an old song made by an aged old pate
 of an old worshipful gentleman who had a great estate
 that kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate
 and an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate

 with an old study fill'd full of learned old books
 with an old reverend chaplain you might know him by his
looks with an old buttery-hatch worn quite off the hooks
 and an old kitchen that maintained half-a-dozen old cooks
 like an old courtier etc old song

there is no species of humor in which the english more excel than that
which consists in caricaturing and giving ludicrous appellations or
nicknames in this way they have whimsically designated not merely
individuals but nations and in their fondness for pushing a joke they
have not spared even themselves one would think that in personifying
itself a nation would be apt to picture something grand heroic and
imposing but it is characteristic of the peculiar humor of the english
and of their love for what is blunt comic and familiar that they have
embodied their national oddities in the figure of a sturdy corpulent
old fellow with a three-cornered hat red waistcoat leather breeches
and stout oaken cudgel thus they have taken a singular delight in
exhibiting their most private foibles in a laughable point of view and
have been so successful in their delineations that there is scarcely
a being in actual existence more absolutely present to the public mind
than that eccentric personage john bull

perhaps the continual contemplation of the character thus drawn of them
has contributed to fix it upon the nation and thus to give reality
to what at first may have been painted in a great measure from the
imagination men are apt to acquire peculiarities that are continually
ascribed to them the common orders of english seem wonderfully
captivated with the beau ideal which they have formed of john bull and
endeavor to act up to the broad caricature that is perpetually before
their eyes unluckily they sometimes make their boasted bullism an
apology for their prejudice or grossness and this i have especially
noticed among those truly homebred and genuine sons of the soil who have
never migrated beyond the sound of bow bells if one of these should
be a little uncouth in speech and apt to utter impertinent truths he
confesses that he is a real john bull and always speaks his mind if he
now and then flies into an unreasonable burst of passion about trifles
he observes that john bull is a choleric old blade but then his passion
is over in a moment and he bears no malice if he betrays a coarseness
of taste and an insensibility to foreign refinements he thanks heaven
for his ignorance he is a plain john bull and has no relish for
frippery and knick-knacks his very proneness to be gulled by strangers
and to pay extravagantly for absurdities is excused under the plea of
munificence for john is always more generous than wise

thus under the name of john bull he will contrive to argue every fault
into a merit and will frankly convict himself of being the honestest
fellow in existence

however little therefore the character may have suited in the first
instance it has gradually adapted itself to the nation or rather they
have adapted themselves to each other and a stranger who wishes to
study english peculiarities may gather much valuable information from
the innumerable portraits of john bull as exhibited in the windows
of the caricature-shops still however he is one of those fertile
humorists that are continually throwing out new portraits and presenting
different aspects from different points of view and often as he has
been described i cannot resist the temptation to give a slight sketch
of him such as he has met my eye

john bull to all appearance is a plain downright matter-of-fact
fellow with much less of poetry about him than rich prose there is
little of romance in his nature but a vast deal of strong natural
feeling he excels in humor more than in wit is jolly rather than gay
melancholy rather than morose can easily be moved to a sudden tear or
surprised into a broad laugh but he loathes sentiment and has no turn
for light pleasantry he is a boon companion if you allow him in to
have his humor and to talk about himself and he will stand by a friend
in a quarrel with life and purse however soundly he may be cudgelled

in this last respect to tell the truth he has a propensity to be
somewhat too ready he is a busy-minded personage who thinks not merely
for himself and family but for all the country round and is most
generously disposed to be everybody's champion he is continually
volunteering his services to settle his neighbor's affairs and takes
it in great dudgeon if they engage in any matter of consequence without
asking his advice though he seldom engages in any friendly office of
the kind without finishing by getting into a squabble with all parties
and then railing bitterly at their ingratitude he unluckily took
lessons in his youth in the noble science of defence and having
accomplished himself in the use of his limbs and his weapons and become
a perfect master at boxing and cudgel-play he has had a troublesome
life of it ever since he cannot hear of a quarrel between the most
distant of his neighbors but he begins incontinently to fumble with the
head of his cudgel and consider whether his interest or honor does not
require that he should meddle in the broil indeed he has extended his
relations of pride and policy so completely over the whole country
that no event can take place without infringing some of his finely-spun
rights and dignities couched in his little domain with these
filaments stretching forth in every direction he is like some choleric
bottle-bellied old spider who has woven his web over a whole chamber
so that a fly cannot buzz nor a breeze blow without startling his repose
and causing him to sally forth wrathfully from his den

though really a good-hearted good-tempered old fellow at bottom yet he
is singularly fond of being in the midst of contention it is one of
his peculiarities however that he only relishes the beginning of an
affray he always goes into a fight with alacrity but comes out of
it grumbling even when victorious and though no one fights with more
obstinacy to carry a contested point yet when the battle is over and he
comes to the reconciliation he is so much taken up with the mere shaking
of hands that he is apt to let his antagonist pocket all that they have
been quarrelling about it is not therefore fighting that he ought so
much to be on his guard against as making friends it is difficult to
cudgel him out of a farthing but put him in a good humor and you may
bargain him out of all the money in his pocket he is like a stout ship
which will weather the roughest storm uninjured but roll its masts
overboard in the succeeding calm

he is a little fond of playing the magnifico abroad of pulling out
a long purse flinging his money bravely about at boxing-matches
horse-races cock-fights and carrying a high head among gentlemen of
the fancy but immediately after one of these fits of extravagance he
will be taken with violent qualms of economy stop short at the most
trivial expenditure talk desperately of being ruined and brought upon
the parish and in such moods will not pay the smallest tradesman's
bill without violent altercation he is in fact the most punctual
and discontented paymaster in the world drawing his coin out of his
breeches pocket with infinite reluctance paying to the uttermost
farthing but accompanying every guinea with a growl

with all his talk of economy however he is a bountiful provider and
a hospitable housekeeper his economy is of a whimsical kind its chief
object being to devise how he may afford to be extravagant for he will
begrudge himself a beefsteak and pint of port one day that he may roast
an ox whole broach a hogshead of ale and treat all his neighbors on
the next

his domestic establishment is enormously expensive not so much from
any great outward parade as from the great consumption of solid beef
and pudding the vast number of followers he feeds and clothes and his
singular disposition to pay hugely for small services he is a most
kind and indulgent master and provided his servants humor his
peculiarities flatter his vanity a little now and then and do
not peculate grossly on him before his face they may manage him to
perfection everything that lives on him seems to thrive and grow fat
his house-servants are well paid and pampered and have little to do his
horses are sleek and lazy and prance slowly before his state carriage
and his house-dogs sleep quietly about the door and will hardly bark at
a housebreaker

his family mansion is an old castellated manor-house gray with age and
of a most venerable though weather-beaten appearance it has been built
upon no regular plan but is a vast accumulation of parts erected
in various tastes and ages the centre bears evident traces of saxon
architecture and is as solid as ponderous stone and old english oak
can make it like all the relics of that style it is full of obscure
passages intricate mazes and dusty chambers and though these have
been partially lighted up in modern days yet there are many places
where you must still grope in the dark additions have been made to the
original edifice from time to time and great alterations have taken
place towers and battlements have been erected during wars and tumults
wings built in time of peace and out-houses lodges and offices run up
according to the whim or convenience of different generations until it
has become one of the most spacious rambling tenements imaginable an
entire wing is taken up with the family chapel a reverend pile that
must have been exceedingly sumptuous and indeed in spite of having
been altered and simplified at various periods has still a look of
solemn religious pomp its walls within are storied with the monuments
of john's ancestors and it is snugly fitted up with soft cushions and
well-lined chairs where such of his family as are inclined to church
services may doze comfortably in the discharge of their duties

to keep up this chapel has cost john much money but he is staunch in
his religion and piqued in his zeal from the circumstance that many
dissenting chapels have been erected in his vicinity and several of his
neighbors with whom he has had quarrels are strong papists

to do the duties of the chapel he maintains at a large expense a pious
and portly family chaplain he is a most learned and decorous personage
and a truly well-bred christian who always backs the old gentleman in
his opinions winks discreetly at his little peccadilloes rebukes the
children when refractory and is of great use in exhorting the tenants
to read their bibles say their prayers and above all to pay their
rents punctually and without grumbling

the family apartments are in a very antiquated taste somewhat heavy and
often inconvenient but full of the solemn magnificence of former times
fitted up with rich though faded tapestry unwieldy furniture and
loads of massy gorgeous old plate the vast fireplaces ample kitchens
extensive cellars and sumptuous banqueting-halls all speak of the
roaring hospitality of days of yore of which the modern festivity at
the manor-house is but a shadow there are however complete suites of
rooms apparently deserted and time-worn and towers and turrets that
are tottering to decay so that in high winds there is danger of their
tumbling about the ears of the household

john has frequently been advised to have the old edifice thoroughly
overhauled and to have some of the useless parts pulled down and the
others strengthened with their materials but the old gentleman always
grows testy on this subject he swears the house is an excellent house
that it is tight and weather-proof and not to be shaken by tempests
that it has stood for several hundred years and therefore is not likely
to tumble down now that as to its being inconvenient his family is
accustomed to the inconveniences and would not be comfortable without
them that as to its unwieldy size and irregular construction these
result from its being the growth of centuries and being improved by the
wisdom of every generation that an old family like his requires
a large house to dwell in new upstart families may live in modern
cottages and snug boxes but an old english family should inhabit an
old english manor-house if you point out any part of the building
as superfluous he insists that it is material to the strength or
decoration of the rest and the harmony of the whole and swears that the
parts are so built into each other that if you pull down one you run
the risk of having the whole about your ears

the secret of the matter is that john has a great disposition to
protect and patronize he thinks it indispensable to the dignity of an
ancient and honorable family to be bounteous in its appointments and
to be eaten up by dependents and so partly from pride and partly
from kind-heartedness he makes it a rule always to give shelter and
maintenance to his superannuated servants

the consequence is that like many other venerable family
establishments his manor is incumbered by old retainers whom he cannot
turn off and an old style which he cannot lay down his mansion is like
a great hospital of invalids and with all its magnitude is not a whit
too large for its inhabitants not a nook or corner but is of use in
housing some useless personage groups of veteran beef-eaters gouty
pensioners and retired heroes of the buttery and the larder are seen
lolling about its ways crawling over its lawns dozing under its tree
or sunning themselves upon the benches at its doors every office and
out-house is garrisoned by these supernumeraries and their families
for they are amazingly prolific and when they die off are sure to leave
john a legacy of hungry mouths to be provided for a mattock cannot be
struck against the most mouldering tumble-down tower but out pops from
some cranny or loophole the gray pate of some superannuated hanger-on
who has lived at john's expense all his life and makes the most
grievous outcry at their pulling down the roof from over the head of
a worn-out servant of the family this is an appeal that john's honest
heart never can withstand so that a man who has faithfully eaten his
beef and pudding all his life is sure to be rewarded with a pipe and
tankard in his old days

a great part of his park also is turned into paddocks where his
broken-down chargers are turned loose to graze undisturbed for the
remainder of their existences a worthy example of grateful recollection
which if some of his neighbors were to imitate would not be to their
discredit indeed it is one of his great pleasures to point out these
old steeds to his visitors to dwell on their good qualities extol
their past services and boast with some little vain-glory of the
perilous adventures and hardy exploits through which they have carried
him

he is given however to indulge his veneration for family usages and
family encumbrances to a whimsical extent his manor is infested by
gangs of gypsies yet he will not suffer them to be driven off because
they have infested the place time out of mind and been regular poachers
upon every generation of the family he will scarcely permit a dry
branch to be lopped from the great trees that surround the house lest
it should molest the rooks that have bred there for centuries owls have
taken possession of the dovecote but they are hereditary owls and must
not be disturbed swallows have nearly choked up every chimney with
their nests martins build in every frieze and cornice crows flutter
about the towers and perch on every weather-cock and old gray-headed
rats may be seen in every quarter of the house running in and out of
their holes undauntedly in broad daylight in short john has such a
reverence for everything that has been long in the family that he will
not hear even of abuses being reformed because they are good old family
abuses

all these whims and habits have concurred woefully to drain the old
gentleman's purse and as he prides himself on punctuality in money
matters and wishes to maintain his credit in the neighborhood they have
caused him great perplexity in meeting his engagements this too
has been increased by the altercations and heart-burnings which are
continually taking place in his family his children have been brought
up to different callings and are of different ways of thinking and as
they have always been allowed to speak their minds freely they do not
fail to exercise the privilege most clamorously in the present posture
of his affairs some stand up for the honor of the race and are clear
that the old establishment should be kept up in all its state whatever
may be the cost others who are more prudent and considerate entreat
the old gentleman to retrench his expenses and to put his whole system
of housekeeping on a more moderate footing he has indeed at times
seemed inclined to listen to their opinions but their wholesome advice
has been completely defeated by the obstreperous conduct of one of his
sons this is a noisy rattle-pated fellow of rather low habits who
neglects his business to frequent ale-houses is the orator of village
clubs and a complete oracle among the poorest of his father's
tenants no sooner does he hear any of his brothers mention reform or
retrenchment than up he jumps takes the words out of their mouths and
roars out for an overturn when his tongue is once going nothing
can stop it he rants about the room hectors the old man about his
spendthrift practices ridicules his tastes and pursuits insists that
he shall turn the old servants out of doors give the broken-down horses
to the hounds send the fat chaplain packing and take a field-preacher
in his place nay that the whole family mansion shall be levelled with
the ground and a plain one of brick and mortar built in its place he
rails at every social entertainment and family festivity and skulks
away growling to the ale-house whenever an equipage drives up to the
door though constantly complaining of the emptiness of his purse
yet he scruples not to spend all his pocket-money in these tavern
convocations and even runs up scores for the liquor over which he
preaches about his father's extravagance

it may readily be imagined how little such thwarting agrees with the old
cavalier's fiery temperament he has become so irritable from repeated
crossings that the mere mention of retrenchment or reform is a signal
for a brawl between him and the tavern oracle as the latter is too
sturdy and refractory for paternal discipline having grown out of all
fear of the cudgel they have frequent scenes of wordy warfare which at
times run so high that john is fain to call in the aid of his son tom
an officer who has served abroad but is at present living at home on
half-pay this last is sure to stand by the old gentleman right or
wrong likes nothing so much as a rocketing roistering life and is
ready at a wink or nod to out sabre and flourish it over the orator's
head if he dares to array himself against parental authority

these family dissensions as usual have got abroad and are rare food
for scandal in john's neighborhood people begin to look wise and shake
their heads whenever his affairs are mentioned they all hope that
matters are not so bad with him as represented but when a man's
own children begin to rail at his extravagance things must be badly
managed they understand he is mortgaged over head and ears and is
continually dabbling with money-lenders he is certainly an open-handed
old gentleman but they fear he has lived too fast indeed they never
knew any good come of this fondness for hunting racing revelling and
prize-fighting in short mr bull's estate is a very fine one and has
been in the family a long while but for all that they have known many
finer estates come to the hammer

what is worst of all is the effect which these pecuniary embarrassments
and domestic feuds have had on the poor man himself instead of that
jolly round corporation and smug rosy face which he used to present he
has of late become as shrivelled and shrunk as a frost-bitten apple
his scarlet gold-laced waistcoat which bellied out so bravely in those
prosperous days when he sailed before the wind now hangs loosely about
him like a mainsail in a calm his leather breeches are all in folds and
wrinkles and apparently have much ado to hold up the boots that yawn on
both sides of his once sturdy legs

instead of strutting about as formerly with his three-cornered hat on
one side flourishing his cudgel and bringing it down every moment with
a hearty thump upon the ground looking every one sturdily in the face
and trolling out a stave of a catch or a drinking-song he now goes
about whistling thoughtfully to himself with his head drooping down
his cudgel tucked under his arm and his hands thrust to the bottom of
his breeches pockets which are evidently empty

such is the plight of honest john bull at present yet for all this the
old fellow's spirit is as tall and as gallant as ever if you drop the
least expression of sympathy or concern he takes fire in an instant
swears that he is the richest and stoutest fellow in the country talks
of laying out large sums to adorn his house or buy another estate and
with a valiant swagger and grasping of his cudgel longs exceedingly to
have another bout at quarter-staff

though there may be something rather whimsical in all this yet i
confess i cannot look upon john's situation without strong feelings
of interest with all his odd humors and obstinate prejudices he is a
sterling-hearted old blade he may not be so wonderfully fine a fellow
as he thinks himself but he is at least twice as good as his neighbors
represent him his virtues are all his own all plain homebred and
unaffected his very faults smack of the raciness of his good qualities
his extravagance savors of his generosity his quarrelsomeness of his
courage his credulity of his open faith his vanity of his pride and
his bluntness of his sincerity they are all the redundancies of a rich
and liberal character he is like his own oak rough without but sound
and solid within whose bark abounds with excrescences in proportion to
the growth and grandeur of the timber and whose branches make a fearful
groaning and murmuring in the least storm from their very magnitude and
luxuriance there is something too in the appearance of his old family
mansion that is extremely poetical and picturesque and as long as it
can be rendered comfortably habitable i should almost tremble to see it
meddled with during the present conflict of tastes and opinions some of
his advisers are no doubt good architects that might be of service but
many i fear are mere levellers who when they had once got to work
with their mattocks on this venerable edifice would never stop until
they had brought it to the ground and perhaps buried themselves among
the ruins all that i wish is that john's present troubles may teach
him more prudence in future that he may cease to distress his mind
about other people's affairs that he may give up the fruitless attempt
to promote the good of his neighbors and the peace and happiness of
the world by dint of the cudgel that he may remain quietly at home
gradually get his house into repair cultivate his rich estate according
to his fancy husband his income if he thinks proper bring his unruly
children into order if he can renew the jovial scenes of ancient
prosperity and long enjoy on his paternal lands a green an honorable
and a merry old age




the pride of the village

 may no wolfe howle no screech owle stir
 a wing about thy sepulchre
 no boysterous winds or stormes come hither
 to starve or wither
 thy soft sweet earth but like a spring
 love kept it ever flourishing
 herrick

in the course of an excursion through one of the remote counties of
england i had struck into one of those cross-roads that lead through
the more secluded parts of the country and stopped one afternoon at a
village the situation of which was beautifully rural and retired there
was an air of primitive simplicity about its inhabitants not to be found
in the villages which lie on the great coach-roads i determined to
pass the night there and having taken an early dinner strolled out to
enjoy the neighboring scenery

my ramble as is usually the case with travellers soon led me to the
church which stood at a little distance from the village indeed it
was an object of some curiosity its old tower being completely overrun
with ivy so that only here and there a jutting buttress an angle of
gray wall or a fantastically carved ornament peered through the verdant
covering it was a lovely evening the early part of the day had been
dark and showery but in the afternoon it had cleared up and though
sullen clouds still hung overhead yet there was a broad tract of golden
sky in the west from which the setting sun gleamed through the dripping
leaves and lit up all nature into a melancholy smile it seemed like the
parting hour of a good christian smiling on the sins and sorrows of the
world and giving in the serenity of his decline an assurance that he
will rise again in glory

i had seated myself on a half-sunken tombstone and was musing as one
is apt to do at this sober-thoughted hour on past scenes and early
friends on those who were distant and those who were dead and
indulging in that kind of melancholy fancying which has in it something
sweeter even than pleasure every now and then the stroke of a bell from
the neighboring tower fell on my ear its tones were in unison with the
scene and instead of jarring chimed in with my feelings and it was
some time before i recollected that it must be tolling the knell of some
new tenant of the tomb

presently i saw a funeral train moving across the village green it
wound slowly along a lane was lost and reappeared through the breaks
of the hedges until it passed the place where i was sitting the pall
was supported by young girls dressed in white and another about the
age of seventeen walked before bearing a chaplet of white flowers a
token that the deceased was a young and unmarried female the corpse
was followed by the parents they were a venerable couple of the better
order of peasantry the father seemed to repress his feelings but his
fixed eye contracted brow and deeply-furrowed face showed the struggle
that was passing within his wife hung on his arm and wept aloud with
the convulsive bursts of a mother's sorrow

i followed the funeral into the church the bier was placed in the
centre aisle and the chaplet of white flowers with a pair of white
gloves was hung over the seat which the deceased had occupied

every one knows the soul-subduing pathos of the funeral service for who
is so fortunate as never to have followed some one he has loved to the
tomb but when performed over the remains of innocence and beauty thus
laid low in the bloom of existence what can be more affecting at that
simple but most solemn consignment of the body to the grave-earth
to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust the tears of the youthful
companions of the deceased flowed unrestrained the father still seemed
to struggle with his feelings and to comfort himself with the assurance
that the dead are blessed which die in the lord but the mother only
thought of her child as a flower of the field cut down and withered
in the midst of its sweetness she was like rachel mourning over her
children and would not be comforted

on returning to the inn i learnt the whole story of the deceased it was
a simple one and such as has often been told she had been the beauty
and pride of the village her father had once been an opulent farmer
but was reduced in circumstances this was an only child and brought up
entirely at home in the simplicity of rural life she had been the pupil
of the village pastor the favorite lamb of his little flock the good
man watched over her education with paternal care it was limited and
suitable to the sphere in which she was to move for he only sought to
make her an ornament to her station in life not to raise her above it
the tenderness and indulgence of her parents and the exemption from
all ordinary occupations had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of
character that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form she
appeared like some tender plant of the garden blooming accidentally amid
the hardier natives of the fields

the superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledged by her
companions but without envy for it was surpassed by the unassuming
gentleness and winning kindness of her manners it might be truly said
of her

 this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
 ran on the green-sward nothing she does or seems
 but smacks of something greater than herself
 too noble for this place

the village was one of those sequestered spots which still retain some
vestiges of old english customs it had its rural festivals and holiday
pastimes and still kept up some faint observance of the once popular
rites of may these indeed had been promoted by its present pastor
who was a lover of old customs and one of those simple christians that
think their mission fulfilled by promoting joy on earth and good-will
among mankind under his auspices the may-pole stood from year to year
in the centre of the village green on mayday it was decorated with
garlands and streamers and a queen or lady of the may was appointed as
in former times to preside at the sports and distribute the prizes and
rewards the picturesque situation of the village and the fancifulness
of its rustic fetes would often attract the notice of casual visitors
among these on one may-day was a young officer whose regiment had been
recently quartered in the neighborhood he was charmed with the native
taste that pervaded this village pageant but above all with the
dawning loveliness of the queen of may it was the village favorite who
was crowned with flowers and blushing and smiling in all the beautiful
confusion of girlish diffidence and delight the artlessness of rural
habits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance he gradually won
his way into her intimacy and paid his court to her in that unthinking
way in which young officers are too apt to trifle with rustic
simplicity

there was nothing in his advances to startle or alarm he never even
talked of love but there are modes of making it more eloquent than
language and which convey it subtilely and irresistibly to the heart
the beam of the eye the tone of voice the thousand tendernesses
which emanate from every word and look and action these form the true
eloquence of love and can always be felt and understood but never
described can we wonder that they should readily win a heart young
guileless and susceptible as to her she loved almost unconsciously
she scarcely inquired what was the growing passion that was absorbing
every thought and feeling or what were to be its consequences she
indeed looked not to the future when present his looks and words
occupied her whole attention when absent she thought but of what had
passed at their recent interview she would wander with him through the
green lanes and rural scenes of the vicinity he taught her to see new
beauties in nature he talked in the language of polite and cultivated
life and breathed into her ear the witcheries of romance and poetry

perhaps there could not have been a passion between the sexes more pure
than this innocent girl's the gallant figure of her youthful admirer
and the splendor of his military attire might at first have charmed her
eye but it was not these that had captivated her heart her attachment
had something in it of idolatry she looked up to him as to a being of
a superior order she felt in his society the enthusiasm of a mind
naturally delicate and poetical and now first awakened to a keen
perception of the beautiful and grand of the sordid distinctions
of rank and fortune she thought nothing it was the difference of
intellect of demeanor of manners from those of the rustic society
to which she had been accustomed that elevated him in her opinion she
would listen to him with charmed ear and downcast look of mute delight
and her cheek would mantle with enthusiasm or if ever she ventured a
shy glance of timid admiration it was as quickly withdrawn and she
would sigh and blush at the idea of her comparative unworthiness

her lover was equally impassioned but his passion was mingled with
feelings of a coarser nature he had begun the connection in levity
for he had often heard his brother-officers boast of their village
conquests and thought some triumph of the kind necessary to his
reputation as a man of spirit but he was too full of youthful fervor
his heart had not yet been rendered sufficiently cold and selfish by a
wandering and a dissipated life it caught fire from the very flame it
sought to kindle and before he was aware of the nature of his situation
he became really in love

what was he to do there were the old obstacles which so incessantly
occur in these heedless attachments his rank in life the prejudices of
titled connections his dependence upon a proud and unyielding father
all forbade him to think of matrimony but when he looked down upon
this innocent being so tender and confiding there was a purity in her
manners a blamelessness in her life and a beseeching modesty in her
looks that awed down every licentious feeling in vain did he try to
fortify himself by a thousand heartless examples of men of fashion and
to chill the glow of generous sentiment with that cold derisive levity
with which he had heard them talk of female virtue whenever he came
into her presence she was still surrounded by that mysterious but
impassive charm of virgin purity in whose hallowed sphere no guilty
thought can live

the sudden arrival of orders for the regiment to repair to the continent
completed the confusion of his mind he remained for a short time in a
state of the most painful irresolution he hesitated to communicate the
tidings until the day for marching was at hand when he gave her the
intelligence in the course of an evening ramble

the idea of parting had never before occurred to her it broke in at
once upon her dream of felicity she looked upon it as a sudden and
insurmountable evil and wept with the guileless simplicity of a child
he drew her to his bosom and kissed the tears from her soft cheek nor
did he meet with a repulse for there are moments of mingled sorrow
and tenderness which hallow the caresses of affection he was naturally
impetuous and the sight of beauty apparently yielding in his arms the
confidence of his power over her and the dread of losing her forever
all conspired to overwhelm his better feelings he ventured to propose
that she should leave her home and be the companion of his fortunes

he was quite a novice in seduction and blushed and faltered at his own
baseness but so innocent of mind was his intended victim that she was
at first at a loss to comprehend his meaning and why she should leave
her native village and the humble roof of her parents when at last
the nature of his proposal flashed upon her pure mind the effect was
withering she did not weep she did not break forth into reproach she
said not a word but she shrunk back aghast as from a viper gave him a
look of anguish that pierced to his very soul and clasping her hands
in agony fled as if for refuge to her father's cottage

the officer retired confounded humiliated and repentant it is
uncertain what might have been the result of the conflict of his
feelings had not his thoughts been diverted by the bustle of departure
new scenes new pleasures and new companions soon dissipated his
self-reproach and stifled his tenderness yet amidst the stir of camps
the revelries of garrisons the array of armies and even the din of
battles his thoughts would sometimes steal back to the scenes of rural
quiet and village simplicity the white cottage the footpath along
the silver brook and up the hawthorn hedge and the little village maid
loitering along it leaning on his arm and listening to him with eyes
beaming with unconscious affection

the shock which the poor girl had received in the destruction of all her
ideal world had indeed been cruel faintings and hysterics had at first
shaken her tender frame and were succeeded by a settled and pining
melancholy she had beheld from her window the march of the departing
troops she had seen her faithless lover borne off as if in triumph
amidst the sound of drum and trumpet and the pomp of arms she strained
a last aching gaze after him as the morning sun glittered about his
figure and his plume waved in the breeze he passed away like a bright
vision from her sight and left her all in darkness

it would be trite to dwell on the particulars of her after story it
was like other tales of love melancholy she avoided society and
wandered out alone in the walks she had most frequented with her lover
she sought like the stricken deer to weep in silence and loneliness
and brood over the barbed sorrow that rankled in her soul sometimes
she would be seen late of an evening sitting in the porch of the village
church and the milk-maids returning from the fields would now and
then overhear her singing some plaintive ditty in the hawthorn walk she
became fervent in her devotions at church and as the old people saw her
approach so wasted away yet with a hectic gloom and that hallowed air
which melancholy diffuses round the form they would make way for her as
for something spiritual and looking after her would shake their heads
in gloomy foreboding

she felt a conviction that she was hastening to the tomb but looked
forward to it as a place of rest the silver cord that had bound her to
existence was loosed and there seemed to be no more pleasure under the
sun if ever her gentle bosom had entertained resentment against her
lover it was extinguished she was incapable of angry passions and in
a moment of saddened tenderness she penned him a farewell letter it was
couched in the simplest language but touching from its very simplicity
she told him that she was dying and did not conceal from him that his
conduct was the cause she even depicted the sufferings which she had
experienced but concluded with saying that she could not die in peace
until she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing

by degrees her strength declined that she could no longer leave the
cottage she could only totter to the window where propped up in
her chair it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the
landscape still she uttered no complaint nor imparted to any one the
malady that was preying on her heart she never even mentioned her
lover's name but would lay her head on her mother's bosom and weep in
silence her poor parents hung in mute anxiety over this fading blossom
of their hopes still flattering themselves that it might again revive
to freshness and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed
her cheek might be the promise of returning health

in this way she was seated between them one sunday afternoon her hands
were clasped in theirs the lattice was thrown open and the soft
air that stole in brought with it the fragrance of the clustering
honeysuckle which her own hands had trained round the window

her father had just been reading a chapter in the bible it spoke of the
vanity of worldly things and of the joys of heaven it seemed to have
diffused comfort and serenity through her bosom her eye was fixed on
the distant village church the bell had tolled for the evening service
the last villager was lagging into the porch and everything had sunk
into that hallowed stillness peculiar to the day of rest her parents
were gazing on her with yearning hearts sickness and sorrow which
pass so roughly over some faces had given to hers the expression of a
seraph's a tear trembled in her soft blue eye was she thinking of
her faithless lover or were her thoughts wandering to that distant
churchyard into whose bosom she might soon be gathered

suddenly the clang of hoofs was heard a horseman galloped to the
cottage he dismounted before the window the poor girl gave a faint
exclamation and sunk back in her chair it was her repentant lover he
rushed into the house and flew to clasp her to his bosom but her
wasted form her deathlike countenance so wan yet so lovely in its
desolation smote him to the soul and he threw himself in agony at her
feet she was too faint to rise she attempted to extend her trembling
hand her lips moved as if she spoke but no word was articulated she
looked down upon him with a smile of unutterable tenderness and closed
her eyes forever

such are the particulars which i gathered of this village story they
are but scanty and i am conscious have little novelty to recommend
them in the present rage also for strange incident and high-seasoned
narrative they may appear trite and insignificant but they interested
me strongly at the time and taken in connection with the affecting
ceremony which i had just witnessed left a deeper impression on my mind
than many circumstances of a more striking nature i have passed through
the place since and visited the church again from a better motive than
mere curiosity it was a wintry evening the trees were stripped of
their foliage the churchyard looked naked and mournful and the wind
rustled coldly through the dry grass evergreens however had been
planted about the grave of the village favorite and osiers were bent
over it to keep the turf uninjured

the church-door was open and i stepped in there hung the chaplet of
flowers and the gloves as on the day of the funeral the flowers were
withered it is true but care seemed to have been taken that no dust
should soil their whiteness i have seen many monuments where art has
exhausted its powers to awaken the sympathy of the spectator but i have
met with none that spoke more touchingly to my heart than this simple
but delicate memento of departed innocence




the angler

 this day dame nature seem'd in love
 the lusty sap began to move
 fresh juice did stir th embracing vines
 and birds had drawn their valentines
 the jealous trout that low did lie
 rose at a well-dissembled flie
 there stood my friend with patient skill
 attending of his trembling quill
 sir h wotton

it is said that many an unlucky urchin is induced to run away from his
family and betake himself to a seafaring life from reading the history
of robinson crusoe and i suspect that in like manner many of those
worthy gentlemen who are given to haunt the sides of pastoral streams
with angle-rods in hand may trace the origin of their passion to
the seductive pages of honest izaak walton i recollect studying his
complete angler several years since in company with a knot of friends
in america and moreover that we were all completely bitten with the
angling mania it was early in the year but as soon as the weather was
auspicious and that the spring began to melt into the verge of summer
we took rod in hand and sallied into the country as stark mad as was
ever don quixote from reading books of chivalry

one of our party had equalled the don in the fulness of his equipments
being attired cap-a-pie for the enterprise he wore a broad-skirted
fustian coat perplexed with half a hundred pockets a pair of stout
shoes and leathern gaiters a basket slung on one side for fish a
patent rod a landing net and a score of other inconveniences only to
be found in the true angler's armory thus harnessed for the field he
was as great a matter of stare and wonderment among the country folk
who had never seen a regular angler as was the steel-clad hero of la
mancha among the goatherds of the sierra morena

our first essay was along a mountain brook among the highlands of the
hudson a most unfortunate place for the execution of those piscatory
tactics which had been invented along the velvet margins of quiet
english rivulets it was one of those wild streams that lavish among
our romantic solitudes unheeded beauties enough to fill the sketch-book
of a hunter of the picturesque sometimes it would leap down rocky
shelves making small cascades over which the trees threw their broad
balancing sprays and long nameless weeds hung in fringes from the
impending banks dripping with diamond drops sometimes it would brawl
and fret along a ravine in the matted shade of a forest filling it with
murmurs and after this termagant career would steal forth into open
day with the most placid demure face imaginable as i have seen some
pestilent shrew of a housewife after filling her home with uproar
and ill-humor come dimpling out of doors swimming and curtseying and
smiling upon all the world

how smoothly would this vagrant brook glide at such times through some
bosom of green meadowland among the mountains where the quiet was only
interrupted by the occasional tinkling of a bell from the lazy cattle
among the clover or the sound of a woodcutter's axe from the neighboring
forest

for my part i was always a bungler at all kinds of sport that required
either patience or adroitness and had not angled above half an hour
before i had completely satisfied the sentiment and convinced myself
of the truth of izaak walton's opinion that angling is something like
poetry a man must be born to it i hooked myself instead of the fish
tangled my line in every tree lost my bait broke my rod until i gave
up the attempt in despair and passed the day under the trees reading
old izaak satisfied that it was his fascinating vein of honest
simplicity and rural feeling that had bewitched me and not the passion
for angling my companions however were more persevering in their
delusion i have them at this moment before eyes stealing along the
border of the brook where it lay open to the day or was merely fringed
by shrubs and bushes i see the bittern rising with hollow scream as
they break in upon his rarely-invaded haunt the kingfisher watching
them suspiciously from his dry tree that overhangs the deep black
millpond in the gorge of the hills the tortoise letting himself slip
sideways from off the stone or log on which he is sunning himself
and the panic-struck frog plumping in headlong as they approach and
spreading an alarm throughout the watery world around

i recollect also that after toiling and watching and creeping about for
the greater part of a day with scarcely any success in spite of all our
admirable apparatus a lubberly country urchin came down from the hills
with a rod made from a branch of a tree a few yards of twine and as
heaven shall help me i believe a crooked pin for a hook baited with a
vile earthworm and in half an hour caught more fish than we had nibbles
throughout the day

but above all i recollect the good honest wholesome hungry repast
which we made under a beech tree just by a spring of pure sweet water
that stole out of the side of a hill and how when it was over one of
the party read old izaak walton's scene with the milkmaid while i lay
on the grass and built castles in a bright pile of clouds until i fell
asleep all this may appear like mere egotism yet i cannot refrain from
uttering these recollections which are passing like a strain of music
over my mind and have been called up by an agreeable scene which i
witnessed not long since

in the morning's stroll along the banks of the alun a beautiful little
stream which flows down from the welsh hills and throws itself into
the dee my attention was attracted to a group seated on the margin
on approaching i found it to consist of a veteran angler and two rustic
disciples the former was an old fellow with a wooden leg with clothes
very much but very carefully patched betokening poverty honestly come
by and decently maintained his face bore the marks of former storms
but present fair weather its furrows had been worn into an habitual
smile his iron-gray locks hung about his ears and he had altogether
the good-humored air of a constitutional philosopher who was disposed to
take the world as it went one of his companions was a ragged wight with
the skulking look of an arrant poacher and i'll warrant could find
his way to any gentleman's fish-pond in the neighborhood in the darkest
night the other was a tall awkward country lad with a lounging
gait and apparently somewhat of a rustic beau the old man was busy in
examining the maw of a trout which he had just killed to discover by
its contents what insects were seasonable for bait and was lecturing
on the subject to his companions who appeared to listen with infinite
deference i have a kind feeling towards all brothers of the angle
ever since i read izaak walton they are men he affirms of a mild
sweet and peaceable spirit and my esteem for them has been increased
since i met with an old tretyse of fishing with the angle in which are
set forth many of the maxims of their inoffensive fraternity take
good hede sayeth this honest little tretyse that in going about your
disportes ye open no man's gates but that ye shet them again also ye
shall not use this forsayd crafti disport for no covetousness to the
encreasing and sparing of your money only but principally for your
solace and to cause the helth of your body and specyally of your
soule

i thought that i could perceive in the veteran angler before me
an exemplification of what i had read and there was a cheerful
contentedness in his looks that quite drew me towards him i could not
but remark the gallant manner in which he stumped from one part of
the brook to another waving his rod in the air to keep the line from
dragging on the ground or catching among the bushes and the adroitness
with which he would throw his fly to any particular place sometimes
skimming it lightly along a little rapid sometimes casting it into one
of those dark holes made by a twisted root or overhanging bank in
which the large trout are apt to lurk in the meanwhile he was giving
instructions to his two disciples showing them the manner in which
they should handle their rods fix their flies and play them along the
surface of the stream the scene brought to my mind the instructions
of the sage piscator to his scholar the country around was of that
pastoral kind which walton is fond of describing it was a part of the
great plain of cheshire close by the beautiful vale of gessford
and just where the inferior welsh hills begin to swell up from among
fresh-smelling meadows the day too like that recorded in his work was
mild and sunshiny with now and then a soft-dropping shower that sowed
the whole earth with diamonds


 from this same treatise it would appear that angling is a
 more industrious and devout employment than it is generally
 considered for when ye purpose to go on your disportes in
 fishynge ye will not desyre greatlye many persons with you
 which might let you of your game and that ye may serve god
 devoutly in saying effectually your customable prayers and
 thus doying ye shall eschew and also avoyde many vices as
 ydelness which is principall cause to induce man to many
 other vices as it is right well known


i soon fell into conversation with the old angler and was so much
entertained that under pretext of receiving instructions in his art i
kept company with him almost the whole day wandering along the banks of
the stream and listening to his talk he was very communicative having
all the easy garrulity of cheerful old age and i fancy was a little
flattered by having an opportunity of displaying his piscatory lore for
who does not like now and then to play the sage

he had been much of a rambler in his day and had passed some years of
his youth in america particularly in savannah where he had entered
into trade and had been ruined by the indiscretion of a partner he had
afterwards experienced many ups and downs in life until he got into the
navy where his leg was carried away by a cannon-ball at the battle of
camperdown this was the only stroke of real good-fortune he had ever
experienced for it got him a pension which together with some small
paternal property brought him in a revenue of nearly forty pounds
on this he retired to his native village where he lived quietly and
independently and devoted the remainder of his life to the noble art
of angling

i found that he had read izaak walton attentively and he seemed to have
imbibed all his simple frankness and prevalent good-humor though he had
been sorely buffeted about the world he was satisfied that the world
in itself was good and beautiful though he had been as roughly used in
different countries as a poor sheep that is fleeced by every hedge
and thicket yet he spoke of every nation with candor and kindness
appearing to look only on the good side of things and above all he
was almost the only man i had ever met with who had been an unfortunate
adventurer in america and had honesty and magnanimity enough to take the
fault to his own door and not to curse the country the lad that was
receiving his instructions i learnt was the son and heir-apparent of
a fat old widow who kept the village inn and of course a youth of some
expectation and much courted by the idle gentleman-like personages
of the place in taking him under his care therefore the old man had
probably an eye to a privileged corner in the tap-room and an occasional
cup of cheerful ale free of expense

there is certainly something in angling if we could forget which
anglers are apt to do the cruelties and tortures inflicted on worms
and insects that tends to produce a gentleness of spirit and a
pure serenity of mind as the english are methodical even in their
recreations and are the most scientific of sportsmen it has been
reduced among them to perfect rule and system indeed it is an
amusement peculiarly adapted to the mild and highly-cultivated scenery
of england where every roughness has been softened away from the
landscape it is delightful to saunter along those limpid streams
which wander like veins of silver through the bosom of this
beautiful country leading one through a diversity of small home
scenery sometimes winding through ornamented grounds sometimes
brimming along through rich pasturage where the fresh green is mingled
with sweet-smelling flowers sometimes venturing in sight of villages
and hamlets and then running capriciously away into shady retirements
the sweetness and serenity of nature and the quiet watchfulness of the
sport gradually bring on pleasant fits of musing which are now and then
agreeably interrupted by the song of a bird the distant whistle of the
peasant or perhaps the vagary of some fish leaping out of the still
water and skimming transiently about its glassy surface when i would
beget content says izaak walton and increase confidence in the power
and wisdom and providence of almighty god i will walk the meadows by
some gliding stream and there contemplate the lilies that take no care
and those very many other little living creatures that are not only
created but fed man knows not how by the goodness of the god of
nature and therefore trust in him

i cannot forbear to give another quotation from one of those ancient
champions of angling which breathes the same innocent and happy spirit

 let me live harmlessly and near the brink
 of trent or avon have a dwelling-place
 where i may see my quill or cork down sink
 with eager bite of pike or bleak or dace
 and on the world and my creator think
 whilst some men strive ill-gotten goods t embrace
 and others spend their time in base excess
 of wine or worse in war or wantonness

 let them that will these pastimes still pursue
 and on such pleasing fancies feed their fill
 so i the fields and meadows green may view
 and daily by fresh rivers walk at will
 among the daisies and the violets blue
 red hyacinth and yellow daffodil

on parting with the old angler i inquired after his place of abode
and happening to be in the neighborhood of the village a few evenings
afterwards i had the curiosity to seek him out i found him living in
a small cottage containing only one room but a perfect curiosity in its
method and arrangement it was on the skirts of the village on a green
bank a little back from the road with a small garden in front stocked
with kitchen herbs and adorned with a few flowers the whole front of
the cottage was overrun with a honeysuckle on the top was a ship for a
weathercock the interior was fitted up in a truly nautical style his
ideas of comfort and convenience having been acquired on the berth-deck
of a man-of-war a hammock was slung from the ceiling which in the
daytime was lashed up so as to take but little room from the centre of
the chamber hung a model of a ship of his own workmanship two or three
chairs a table and a large sea-chest formed the principal movables
about the wall were stuck up naval ballads such as admiral hosier's
ghost all in the downs and tom bowling intermingled with
pictures of sea-fights among which the battle of camperdown held a
distinguished place the mantelpiece was decorated with sea-shells over
which hung a quadrant flanked by two wood-cuts of most bitter-looking
naval commanders his implements for angling were carefully disposed
on nails and hooks about the room on a shelf was arranged his library
containing a work on angling much worn a bible covered with canvas an
odd volume or two of voyages a nautical almanac and a book of songs


 j davors


his family consisted of a large black cat with one eye and a parrot
which he had caught and tamed and educated himself in the course of
one of his voyages and which uttered a variety of sea-phrases with the
hoarse brattling tone of a veteran boatswain the establishment reminded
me of that of the renowned robinson crusoe it was kept in neat order
everything being stowed away with the regularity of a ship of war
and he informed me that he scoured the deck every morning and swept it
between meals

i found him seated on a bench before the door smoking his pipe in the
soft evening sunshine his cat was purring soberly on the threshold and
his parrot describing some strange evolutions in an iron ring that swung
in the centre of his cage he had been angling all day and gave me a
history of his sport with as much minuteness as a general would talk
over a campaign being particularly animated in relating the manner in
which he had taken a large trout which had completely tasked all his
skill and wariness and which he had sent as a trophy to mine hostess of
the inn

how comforting it is to see a cheerful and contented old age and to
behold a poor fellow like this after being tempest-tost through life
safely moored in a snug and quiet harbor in the evening of his days his
happiness however sprung from within himself and was independent of
external circumstances for he had that inexhaustible good-nature which
is the most precious gift of heaven spreading itself like oil over the
troubled sea of thought and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the
roughest weather

on inquiring further about him i learnt that he was a universal
favorite in the village and the oracle of the tap-room where he
delighted the rustics with his songs and like sindbad astonished them
with his stories of strange lands and shipwrecks and sea-fights he was
much noticed too by gentlemen sportsmen of the neighborhood had taught
several of them the art of angling and was a privileged visitor to
their kitchens the whole tenor of his life was quiet and inoffensive
being principally passed about the neighboring streams when the weather
and season were favorable and at other times he employed himself
at home preparing his fishing-tackle for the next campaign or
manufacturing rods nets and flies for his patrons and pupils among the
gentry

he was a regular attendant at church on sundays though he generally
fell asleep during the sermon he had made it his particular request
that when he died he should be buried in a green spot which he could see
from his seat in church and which he had marked out ever since he was
a boy and had thought of when far from home on the raging sea in danger
of being food for the fishes it was the spot where his father and
mother had been buried

i have done for i fear that my reader is growing weary but i could not
refrain from drawing the picture of this worthy brother of the angle
who has made me more than ever in love with the theory though i fear i
shall never be adroit in the practice of his art and i will conclude
this rambling sketch in the words of honest izaak walton by craving the
blessing of st peter's master upon my reader and upon all that are
true lovers of virtue and dare trust in his providence and be quiet
and go a-angling




the legend of sleepy hollow

found among the papers of the late diedrich knickerbocker

 a pleasing land of drowsy-head it was
 of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye
 and of gay castles in the clouds that pays
 for ever flushing round a summer sky
 castle of indolence

in the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern
shore of the hudson at that broad expansion of the river denominated
by the ancient dutch navigators the tappan zee and where they always
prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of st nicholas
when they crossed there lies a small market-town or rural port which
by some is called greensburg but which is more generally and properly
known by the name of tarry town this name was given we are told in
former days by the good housewives of the adjacent country from the
inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village
tavern on market days be that as it may i do not vouch for the fact
but merely advert to it for the sake of being precise and authentic
not far from this village perhaps about two miles there is a little
valley or rather lap of land among high hills which is one of the
quietest places in the whole world a small brook glides through it
with just murmur enough to lull one to repose and the occasional
whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound
that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity

i recollect that when a stripling my first exploit in squirrel-shooting
was in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet
and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath
stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
if ever i should wish for a retreat whither i might steal from the world
and its distractions and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled
life i know of none more promising than this little valley

from the listless repose of the place and the peculiar character of its
inhabitants who are descendants from the original dutch settlers this
sequestered glen has long been known by the name of sleepy hollow and
its rustic lads are called the sleepy hollow boys throughout all the
neighboring country a drowsy dreamy influence seems to hang over the
land and to pervade the very atmosphere some say that the place
was bewitched by a high german doctor during the early days of the
settlement others that an old indian chief the prophet or wizard of
his tribe held his powwows there before the country was discovered by
master hendrick hudson certain it is the place still continues under
the sway of some witching power that holds a spell over the minds of the
good people causing them to walk in a continual reverie they are given
to all kinds of marvellous beliefs are subject to trances and visions
and frequently see strange sights and hear music and voices in the air
the whole neighborhood abounds with local tales haunted spots and
twilight superstitions stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the
valley than in any other part of the country and the nightmare with
her whole ninefold seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols

the dominant spirit however that haunts this enchanted region and
seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air is the
apparition of a figure on horseback without a head it is said by some
to be the ghost of a hessian trooper whose head had been carried away by
a cannonball in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war and
who is ever and anon seen by the country-folk hurrying along in the
gloom of night as if on the wings of the wind his haunts are not
confined to the valley but extend at times to the adjacent roads and
especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance indeed
certain of the most authentic historians of those parts who have been
careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this
spectre allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in
the churchyard the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly
quest of his head and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes
passes along the hollow like a midnight blast is owing to his being
belated and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak

such is the general purport of this legendary superstition which has
furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows
and the spectre is known at all the country firesides by the name of the
headless horseman of sleepy hollow

it is remarkable that the visionary propensity i have mentioned is not
confined to the native inhabitants of the valley but is unconsciously
imbibed by every one who resides there for a time however wide awake
they may have been before they entered that sleepy region they are sure
in a little time to inhale the witching influence of the air and begin
to grow imaginative to dream dreams and see apparitions

i mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud for it is in such
little retired dutch valleys found here and there embosomed in the
great state of new york that population manners and customs remain
fixed while the great torrent of migration and improvement which is
making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country
sweeps by them unobserved they are like those little nooks of still
water which border a rapid stream where we may see the straw and bubble
riding quietly at anchor or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor
undisturbed by the rush of the passing current though many years have
elapsed since i trod the drowsy shades of sleepy hollow yet i question
whether i should not still find the same trees and the same families
vegetating in its sheltered bosom

in this by-place of nature there abode in a remote period of american
history that is to say some thirty years since a worthy wight of the
name of ichabod crane who sojourned or as he expressed it tarried
in sleepy hollow for the purpose of instructing the children of the
vicinity he was a native of connecticut a state which supplies the
union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest and sends
forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters
the cognomen of crane was not inapplicable to his person he was tall
but exceedingly lank with narrow shoulders long arms and legs hands
that dangled a mile out of his sleeves feet that might have served for
shovels and his whole frame most loosely hung together his head was
small and flat at top with huge ears large green glassy eyes and a
long snip nose so that it looked like a weathercock perched upon his
spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew to see him striding along
the profile of a hill on a windy day with his clothes bagging and
fluttering about him one might have mistaken him for the genius
of famine descending upon the earth or some scarecrow eloped from a
cornfield

his school-house was a low building of one large room rudely
constructed of logs the windows partly glazed and partly patched with
leaves of old copybooks it was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours
by a withe twisted in the handle of the door and stakes set against the
window-shutters so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease
he would find some embarrassment in getting out -an idea most probably
borrowed by the architect yost van houten from the mystery of
an eel-pot the school-house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant
situation just at the foot of a woody hill with a brook running close
by and a formidable birch tree growing at one end of it from hence the
low murmur of his pupils voices conning over their lessons might be
heard in a drowsy summer's day like the hum of a bee-hive interrupted
now and then by the authoritative voice of the master in the tone of
menace or command or peradventure by the appalling sound of the birch
as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge
truth to say he was a conscientious man and ever bore in mind the
golden maxim spare the rod and spoil the child ichabod crane's
scholars certainly were not spoiled

i would not have it imagined however that he was one of those cruel
potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects on
the contrary he administered justice with discrimination rather than
severity taking the burden off the backs of the weak and laying it on
those of the strong your mere puny stripling that winced at the least
flourish of the rod was passed by with indulgence but the claims of
justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little
tough wrong-headed broad-skirted dutch urchin who sulked and swelled
and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch all this he called doing
his duty by their parents and he never inflicted a chastisement
without following it by the assurance so consolatory to the smarting
urchin that he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day
he had to live

when school-hours were over he was even the companion and playmate of
the larger boys and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the
smaller ones home who happened to have pretty sisters or good housewives
for mothers noted for the comforts of the cupboard indeed it behooved
him to keep on good terms with his pupils the revenue arising from his
school was small and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him
with daily bread for he was a huge feeder and though lank had the
dilating powers of an anaconda but to help out his maintenance he was
according to country custom in those parts boarded and lodged at the
houses of the farmers whose children he instructed with these he lived
successively a week at a time thus going the rounds of the neighborhood
with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief

that all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic
patrons who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous
burden and schoolmasters as mere drones he had various ways of
rendering himself both useful and agreeable he assisted the farmers
occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms helped to make
hay mended the fences took the horses to water drove the cows from
pasture and cut wood for the winter fire he laid aside too all the
dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little
empire the school and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating
he found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children
particularly the youngest and like the lion bold which whilom so
magnanimously the lamb did hold he would sit with a child on one knee
and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together

in addition to his other vocations he was the singing-master of the
neighborhood and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the
young folks in psalmody it was a matter of no little vanity to him on
sundays to take his station in front of the church-gallery with a band
of chosen singers where in his own mind he completely carried away
the palm from the parson certain it is his voice resounded far above
all the rest of the congregation and there are peculiar quavers still
to be heard in that church and which may even be heard half a mile off
quite to the opposite side of the mill-pond on a still sunday morning
which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of ichabod
crane thus by divers little makeshifts in that ingenious way which is
commonly denominated by hook and by crook the worthy pedagogue got on
tolerably enough and was thought by all who understood nothing of the
labor of headwork to have a wonderfully easy life of it

the schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female
circle of a rural neighborhood being considered a kind of idle
gentleman-like personage of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to
the rough country swains and indeed inferior in learning only to the
parson his appearance therefore is apt to occasion some little stir
at the tea-table of a farmhouse and the addition of a supernumerary
dish of cakes or sweetmeats or peradventure the parade of a silver
tea-pot our man of letters therefore was peculiarly happy in the
smiles of all the country damsels how he would figure among them in the
churchyard between services on sundays gathering grapes for them from
the wild vines that overrun the surrounding trees reciting for their
amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones or sauntering with a
whole bevy of them along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond while the
more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back envying his superior
elegance and address

from his half-itinerant life also he was a kind of travelling gazette
carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house so that
his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction he was moreover
esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition for he had read
several books quite through and was a perfect master of cotton mather's
history of new england witchcraft in which by the way he most firmly
and potently believed

he was in fact an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple
credulity his appetite for the marvellous and his powers of digesting
it were equally extraordinary and both had been increased by his
residence in this spellbound region no tale was too gross or monstrous
for his capacious swallow it was often his delight after his school
was dismissed in the afternoon to stretch himself on the rich bed of
clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school-house
and there con over old mather's direful tales until the gathering dusk
of the evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes then
as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland to the
farmhouse where he happened to be quartered every sound of nature at
that witching hour fluttered his excited imagination the moan of the
whip-poor-will from the hillside the boding cry of the tree-toad that
harbinger of storm the dreary hooting of the screech-owl or the
sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost the
fire-flies too which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places now
and then startled him as one of uncommon brightness would stream across
his path and if by chance a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging
his blundering flight against him the poor varlet was ready to give up
the ghost with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token his
only resource on such occasions either to drown thought or drive away
evil spirits was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of sleepy
hollow as they sat by their doors of an evening were often filled with
awe at hearing his nasal melody in linked sweetness long drawn out
floating from the distant hill or along the dusky road


 the whip-poor-will is a bird which is only heard at night
 it receives its name from its note which is thought to
 resemble those words


another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter
evenings with the old dutch wives as they sat spinning by the fire with
a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth and listen
to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins and haunted fields
and haunted brooks and haunted bridges and haunted houses and
particularly of the headless horseman or galloping hessian of the
hollow as they sometimes called him he would delight them equally
by his anecdotes of witchcraft and of the direful omens and portentous
sights and sounds in the air which prevailed in the earlier times of
connecticut and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon
comets and shooting stars and with the alarming fact that the world did
absolutely turn round and that they were half the time topsy-turvy

but if there was a pleasure in all this while snugly cuddling in the
chimney-corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the
crackling wood-fire and where of course no spectre dared to show
its face it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk
homewards what fearful shapes and shadows beset his path amidst the dim
and ghastly glare of a snowy night with what wistful look did be eye
every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some
distant window how often was he appalled by some shrub covered with
snow which like a sheeted spectre beset his very path how often did
he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty
crust beneath his feet and dread to look over his shoulder lest he
should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him and how
often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast howling
among the trees in the idea that it was the galloping hessian on one of
his nightly scourings

all these however were mere terrors of the night phantoms of the mind
that walk in darkness and though he had seen many spectres in his time
and been more than once beset by satan in divers shapes in his lonely
perambulations yet daylight put an end to all these evils and he would
have passed a pleasant life of it in despite of the devil and all his
works if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more
perplexity to mortal man than ghosts goblins and the whole race of
witches put together and that was a woman

among the musical disciples who assembled one evening in each week
to receive his instructions in psalmody was katrina van tassel the
daughter and only child of a substantial dutch farmer she was a
blooming lass of fresh eighteen plump as a partridge ripe and melting
and rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches and universally famed
not merely for her beauty but her vast expectations she was withal a
little of a coquette as might be perceived even in her dress which was
a mixture of ancient and modern fashions as most suited to set off
her charms she wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold which her
great-great-grandmother had brought over from saardam the tempting
stomacher of the olden time and withal a provokingly short petticoat to
display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round

ichabod crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex and it is
not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his
eyes more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion
old baltus van tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving contented
liberal-hearted farmer he seldom it is true sent either his eyes or
his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm but within those
everything was snug happy and well-conditioned he was satisfied
with his wealth but not proud of it and piqued himself upon the hearty
abundance rather than the style in which he lived his stronghold was
situated on the banks of the hudson in one of those green sheltered
fertile nooks in which the dutch farmers are so fond of nestling a
great elm tree spread its broad branches over it at the foot of which
bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water in a little well
formed of a barrel and then stole sparkling away through the grass to
a neighboring brook that bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows
hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn that might have served for a
church every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the
treasures of the farm the flail was busily resounding within it from
morning to night swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the
eaves and rows of pigeons some with one eye turned up as if watching
the weather some with their heads under their wings or buried in their
bosoms and others swelling and cooing and bowing about their dames
were enjoying the sunshine on the roof sleek unwieldy porkers were
grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens whence sallied
forth now and then troops of sucking pigs as if to snuff the air
a stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond
convoying whole fleets of ducks regiments of turkeys were gobbling
through the farmyard and guinea-fowls fretting about it like
ill-tempered housewives with their peevish discontented cry before
the barn-door strutted the gallant cock that pattern of a husband a
warrior and a fine gentleman clapping his burnished wings and crowing
in the pride and gladness of his heart sometimes tearing up the earth
with his feet and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of
wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered

the pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise
of luxurious winter fare in his devouring mind's eye he pictured to
himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly
and an apple in his mouth the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a
comfortable pie and tucked in with a coverlet of crust the geese were
swimming in their own gravy and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes
like snug married couples with a decent competency of onion sauce in
the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon and juicy
relishing ham not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up with
its gizzard under its wing and peradventure a necklace of savory
sausages and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back
in a side-dish with uplifted claws as if craving that quarter which
his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living

as the enraptured ichabod fancied all this and as he rolled his great
green eyes over the fat meadow-lands the rich fields of wheat of rye
of buckwheat and indian corn and the orchards burdened with ruddy
fruit which surrounded the warm tenement of van tassel his heart
yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains and his
imagination expanded with the idea how they might be readily turned into
cash and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land and shingle
palaces in the wilderness nay his busy fancy already realized his
hopes and presented to him the blooming katrina with a whole family of
children mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery
with pots and kettles dangling beneath and he beheld himself bestriding
a pacing mare with a colt at her heels setting out for kentucky
tennessee or the lord knows where

when he entered the house the conquest of his heart was complete it
was one of those spacious farmhouses with high-ridged but lowly-sloping
roofs built in the style handed down from the first dutch settlers the
low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front capable of being
closed up in bad weather under this were hung flails harness various
utensils of husbandry and nets for fishing in the neighboring
river benches were built along the sides for summer use and a great
spinning-wheel at one end and a churn at the other showed the various
uses to which this important porch might be devoted from this piazza
the wondering ichabod entered the hall which formed the centre of
the mansion and the place of usual residence here rows of resplendent
pewter ranged on a long dresser dazzled his eyes in one corner
stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun in another a quantity of
linsey-woolsey just from the loom ears of indian corn and strings of
dried apples and peaches hung in gay festoons along the walls mingled
with the gaud of red peppers and a door left ajar gave him a peep into
the best parlor where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables
shone like mirrors andirons with their accompanying shovel and
tongs glistened from their covert of asparagus tops mock-oranges
and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece strings of various-colored
birds eggs were suspended above it a great ostrich egg was hung from
the centre of the room and a corner cupboard knowingly left open
displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china

from the moment ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight the
peace of his mind was at an end and his only study was how to gain the
affections of the peerless daughter of van tassel in this enterprise
however he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of
a knight-errant of yore who seldom had anything but giants enchanters
fiery dragons and such-like easily-conquered adversaries to contend
with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass
and walls of adamant to the castle keep where the lady of his heart was
confined all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way
to the centre of a christmas pie and then the lady gave him her hand as
a matter of course ichabod on the contrary had to win his way to
the heart of a country coquette beset with a labyrinth of whims
and caprices which were forever presenting new difficulties and
impediments and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries
of real flesh and blood the numerous rustic admirers who beset every
portal to her heart keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other
but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor

among these the most formidable was a burly roaring roistering
blade of the name of abraham or according to the dutch abbreviation
brom van brunt the hero of the country round which rang with
his feats of strength and hardihood he was broad-shouldered and
double-jointed with short curly black hair and a bluff but not
unpleasant countenance having a mingled air of fun and arrogance
from his herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the
nickname of brom bones by which he was universally known he was famed
for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship being as dexterous on
horseback as a tartar he was foremost at all races and cockfights and
with the ascendancy which bodily strength acquires in rustic life was
the umpire in all disputes setting his hat on one side and giving his
decisions with an air and tone admitting of no gainsay or appeal he was
always ready for either a fight or a frolic but had more mischief than
ill-will in his composition and with all his overbearing roughness
there was a strong dash of waggish good-humor at bottom he had three or
four boon companions who regarded him as their model and at the head of
whom he scoured the country attending every scene of feud or merriment
for miles around in cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap
surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail and when the folks at a country
gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance whisking
about among a squad of hard riders they always stood by for a squall
sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farm-houses at
midnight with whoop and halloo like a troop of don cossacks and the
old dames startled out of their sleep would listen for a moment till
the hurry-scurry had clattered by and then exclaim ay there goes
brom bones and his gang the neighbors looked upon him with a mixture
of awe admiration and good-will and when any madcap prank or rustic
brawl occurred in the vicinity always shook their heads and warranted
brom bones was at the bottom of it

this rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming katrina
for the object of his uncouth gallantries and though his amorous
toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a
bear yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his
hopes certain it is his advances were signals for rival candidates to
retire who felt no inclination to cross a line in his amours insomuch
that when his horse was seen tied to van tassel's paling on a sunday
night a sure sign that his master was courting or as it is termed
sparking within all other suitors passed by in despair and carried
the war into other quarters

such was the formidable rival with whom ichabod crane had to contend
and considering all things a stouter man than he would have shrunk
from the competition and a wiser man would have despaired he had
however a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature
he was in form and spirit like a supple jack yielding but although
though he bent he never broke and though he bowed beneath the slightest
pressure yet the moment it was away jerk he was as erect and carried
his head as high as ever

to have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness
for he was not man to be thwarted in his amours any more than that
stormy lover achilles ichabod therefore made his advances in a
quiet and gently-insinuating manner under cover of his character of
singing-master he made frequent visits at the farm-house not that he
had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents
which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers balt van
tassel was an easy indulgent soul he loved his daughter better even
than his pipe and like a reasonable man and an excellent father let
her have her way in everything his notable little wife too had enough
to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry for as she
sagely observed ducks and geese are foolish things and must be looked
after but girls can take care of themselves thus while the busy dame
bustled about the house or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the
piazza honest balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other
watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior who armed with a
sword in each hand was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle
of the barn in the meantime ichabod would carry on his suit with the
daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm or sauntering
along in the twilight that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence

i profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won to me they
have always been matters of riddle and admiration some seem to have but
one vulnerable point or door of access while otheres have a thousand
avenues and may be captured in a thousand different ways it is a
great triumph of skill to gain the former but still greater proof
of generalship to maintain possession of the latter for the man must
battle for his fortress at every door and window he who wins a thousand
common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown but he who keeps
undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero certain
it is this was not the case with the redoubtable brom bones and from
the moment ichabod crane made his advances the interests of the former
evidently declined his horse was no longer seen tied at the palings
on sunday nights and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the
preceptor of sleepy hollow

brom who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature would fain have
carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions
to the lady according to the mode of those most concise and simple
reasoners the knights-errant of yore by single combat but ichabod was
too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists
against him he had overheard a boast of bones that he would double
the schoolmaster up and lay him on a shelf of his own school-house
and he was too wary to give him an opportunity there was something
extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system it left brom
no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his
disposition and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival
ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to bones and his gang
of rough riders they harried his hitherto peaceful domains smoked
out his singing school by stopping up the chimney broke into the
schoolhouse at night in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe
and window stakes and turned everything topsy-turvy so that the poor
schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their
meetings there but what was still more annoying brom took all
opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress
and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous
manner and introduced as a rival of ichabod's to instruct her in
psalmody

in this way matters went on for some time without producing any
material effect on the relative situation of the contending powers on
a fine autumnal afternoon ichabod in pensive mood sat enthroned on
the lofty stool whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little
literary realm in his hand he swayed a ferule that sceptre of despotic
power the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne a
constant terror to evildoers while on the desk before him might be
seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons detected upon
the persons of idle urchins such as half-munched apples popguns
whirligigs fly-cages and whole legions of rampant little paper
gamecocks apparently there had been some appalling act of justice
recently inflicted for his scholars were all busily intent upon their
books or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master
and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the school-room
it was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth
jacket and trowsers a round-crowned fragment of a hat like the cap of
mercury and mounted on the back of a ragged wild half-broken colt
which he managed with a rope by way of halter he came clattering up to
the school door with an invitation to ichabod to attend a merry-making
or quilting frolic to be held that evening at mynheer van tassel's
and having delivered his message with that air of importance and effort
at fine language which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of
the kind he dashed over the brook and was seen scampering away up the
hollow full of the importance and hurry of his mission

all was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet school-room the
scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles
those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity and those who
were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear to quicken
their speed or help them over a tall word books were flung aside
without being put away on the shelves inkstands were overturned
benches thrown down and the whole school was turned loose an hour
before the usual time bursting forth like a legion of young
imps yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early
emancipation

the gallant ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet
brushing and furbishing up his best and indeed only suit of rusty
black and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that
hung up in the school-house that he might make his appearance before
his mistress in the true style of a cavalier he borrowed a horse from
the farmer with whom he was domiciliated a choleric old dutchman of the
name of hans van ripper and thus gallantly mounted issued forth like
a knight-errant in quest of adventures but it is meet i should in
the true spirit of romantic story give some account of the looks
and equipments of my hero and his steed the animal he bestrode was a
broken-down plough-horse that had outlived almost everything but his
viciousness he was gaunt and shagged with a ewe neck and a head like a
hammer his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burrs one
eye had lost its pupil and was glaring and spectral but the other had
the gleam of a genuine devil in it still he must have had fire and
mettle in his day if we may judge from the name he bore of gunpowder
he had in fact been a favorite steed of his master's the choleric van
ripper who was a furious rider and had infused very probably some of
his own spirit into the animal for old and broken down as he looked
there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in
the country

ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed he rode with short
stirrups which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle
his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers he carried his whip
perpendicularly in his hand like a sceptre and as his horse jogged on
the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings a
small wool hat rested on the top of his nose for so his scanty strip of
forehead might be called and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out
almost to his horse's tail such was the appearance of ichabod and his
steed as they shambled out of the gate of hans van ripper and it was
altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad
daylight

it was as i have said a fine autumnal day the sky was clear and
serene and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always
associate with the idea of abundance the forests had put on their sober
brown and yellow while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped
by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange purple and scarlet
streaming files of wild-ducks began to make their appearance high in the
air the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech
and hickory nuts and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from
the neighboring stubble-field

the small birds were taking their farewell banquets in the fulness of
their revelry they fluttered chirping and frolicking from bush to bush
and tree to tree capricious from the very profusion and variety around
them there was the honest cock robin the favorite game of stripling
sportsmen with its loud querulous note and the twittering blackbirds
flying in sable clouds and the golden-winged woodpecker with his
crimson crest his broad black gorget and splendid plumage and the
cedar-bird with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little
monteiro cap of feathers and the blue jay that noisy coxcomb in his
gay light-blue coat and white under-clothes screaming and chattering
bobbing and nodding and bowing and pretending to be on good terms with
every songster of the grove

as ichabod jogged slowly on his way his eye ever open to every symptom
of culinary abundance ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly
autumn on all sides he beheld vast store of apples some hanging in
oppressive opulence on the trees some gathered into baskets and barrels
for the market others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press
farther on he beheld great fields of indian corn with its golden ears
peeping from their leafy coverts and holding out the promise of cakes
and hasty pudding and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them turning
up their fair round bellies to the sun and giving ample prospects
of the most luxurious of pies and anon he passed the fragrant
buckwheat-fields breathing the odor of the beehive and as he beheld
them soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks well
buttered and garnished with honey or treacle by the delicate little
dimpled hand of katrina van tassel

thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and sugared
suppositions he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which
look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty hudson the sun
gradually wheeled his broad disk down into the west the wide bosom of
the tappan zee lay motionless and glassy excepting that here and there
a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant
mountain a few amber clouds floated in the sky without a breath of air
to move them the horizon was of a fine golden tint changing gradually
into a pure apple green and from that into the deep blue of the
mid-heaven a slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the
precipices that overhung some parts of the river giving greater depth
to the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides a sloop was loitering
in the distance dropping slowly down with the tide her sail hanging
uselessly against the mast and as the reflection of the sky gleamed
along the still water it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the
air

it was toward evening that ichabod arrived at the castle of the heer
van tassel which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the
adjacent country old farmers a spare leathern-faced race in homespun
coats and breeches blue stockings huge shoes and magnificent pewter
buckles their brisk withered little dames in close crimped caps
long-waisted shortgowns homespun petticoats with scissors and
pincushions and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside buxom lasses
almost as antiquated as their mothers excepting where a straw hat a
fine ribbon or perhaps a white frock gave symptoms of city innovation
the sons in short square-skirted coats with rows of stupendous brass
buttons and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times
especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose it being
esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener
of the hair

brom bones however was the hero of the scene having come to the
gathering on his favorite steed daredevil a creature like himself full
of metal and mischief and which no one but himself could manage he
was in fact noted for preferring vicious animals given to all kinds
of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck for he
held a tractable well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit

fain would i pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon
the enraptured gaze of my hero as he entered the state parlor of van
tassel's mansion not those of the bevy of buxom lasses with their
luxurious display of red and white but the ample charms of a genuine
dutch country tea-table in the sumptuous time of autumn such heaped-up
platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds known only
to experienced dutch housewives there was the doughty doughnut the
tenderer oily koek and the crisp and crumbling cruller sweet cakes
and short cakes ginger cakes and honey cakes and the whole family of
cakes and then there were apple pies and peach pies and pumpkin pies
besides slices of ham and smoked beef and moreover delectable dishes
of preserved plums and peaches and pears and quinces not to mention
broiled shad and roasted chickens together with bowls of milk and
cream all mingled higgledy-piggledy pretty much as i have enumerated
them with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the
midst heaven bless the mark i want breath and time to discuss this
banquet as it deserves and am too eager to get on with my story
happily ichabod crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian but
did ample justice to every dainty

he was a kind and thankful creature whose heart dilated in proportion
as his skin was filled with good cheer and whose spirits rose with
eating as some men's do with drink he could not help too rolling his
large eyes round him as he ate and chuckling with the possibility that
he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury
and splendor then he thought how soon he'd turn his back upon the old
school-house snap his fingers in the face of hans van ripper and every
other niggardly patron and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors
that should dare to call him comrade

old baltus van tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated
with content and good-humor round and jolly as the harvest moon his
hospitable attentions were brief but expressive being confined to a
shake of the hand a slap on the shoulder a loud laugh and a pressing
invitation to fall to and help themselves

and now the sound of the music from the common room or hall summoned
to the dance the musician was an old gray-headed negro who had been the
itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century
his instrument was as old and battered as himself the greater part of
the time he scraped on two or three strings accompanying every movement
of the bow with a motion of the head bowing almost to the ground and
stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start

ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal
powers not a limb not a fibre about him was idle and to have seen
his loosely hung frame in full motion and clattering about the room
you would have thought saint vitus himself that blessed patron of the
dance was figuring before you in person he was the admiration of all
the negroes who having gathered of all ages and sizes from the farm
and the neighborhood stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at
every door and window gazing with delight at the scene rolling their
white eyeballs and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear how
could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous the
lady of his heart was his partner in the dance and smiling graciously
in reply to all his amorous oglings while brom bones sorely smitten
with love and jealousy sat brooding by himself in one corner

when the dance was at an end ichabod was attracted to a knot of the
sager folks who with old van tassel sat smoking at one end of the
piazza gossiping over former times and drawing out long stories about
the war

this neighborhood at the time of which i am speaking was one of those
highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men
the british and american line had run near it during the war it had
therefore been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees
cow-boys and all kinds of border chivalry just sufficient time had
elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little
becoming fiction and in the indistinctness of his recollection to make
himself the hero of every exploit

there was the story of doffue martling a large blue-bearded dutchman
who had nearly taken a british frigate with an old iron nine-pounder
from a mud breastwork only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge
and there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless being too rich
a mynheer to be lightly mentioned who in the battle of whiteplains
being an excellent master of defence parried a musket-ball with a small
sword insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade and
glance off at the hilt in proof of which he was ready at any time to
show the sword with the hilt a little bent there were several more
that had been equally great in the field not one of whom but was
persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy
termination

but all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that
succeeded the neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the
kind local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered
long-settled retreats but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng
that forms the population of most of our country places besides there
is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages for they have
scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in
their graves before their surviving friends have travelled away from the
neighborhood so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds
they have no acquaintance left to call upon this is perhaps the reason
why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established dutch
communities

the immediate causes however of the prevalence of supernatural stories
in these parts was doubtless owing to the vicinity of sleepy hollow
there was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted
region it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting
all the land several of the sleepy hollow people were present at
van tassel's and as usual were doling out their wild and wonderful
legends many dismal tales were told about funeral trains and mourning
cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the
unfortunate major andre was taken and which stood in the neighborhood
some mention was made also of the woman in white that haunted the dark
glen at raven rock and was often heard to shriek on winter nights
before a storm having perished there in the snow the chief part of the
stories however turned upon the favorite spectre of sleepy hollow the
headless horseman who had been heard several times of late patrolling
the country and it was said tethered his horse nightly among the
graves in the churchyard

the sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a
favorite haunt of troubled spirits it stands on a knoll surrounded by
locust trees and lofty elms from among which its decent whitewashed
walls shine modestly forth like christian purity beaming through the
shades of retirement a gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet
of water bordered by high trees between which peeps may be caught at
the blue hills of the hudson to look upon its grass-grown yard where
the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly one would think that there at
least the dead might rest in peace on one side of the church extends a
wide woody dell along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and
trunks of fallen trees over a deep black part of the stream not far
from the church was formerly thrown a wooden bridge the road that led
to it and the bridge itself were thickly shaded by overhanging trees
which cast a gloom about it even in the daytime but occasioned a
fearful darkness at night such was one of the favorite haunts of
the headless horseman and the place where he was most frequently
encountered the tale was told of old brouwer a most heretical
disbeliever in ghosts how he met the horseman returning from his foray
into sleepy hollow and was obliged to get up behind him how they
galloped over bush and brake over hill and swamp until they reached
the bridge when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton threw old
brouwer into the brook and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap
of thunder

this story was immediately matched by a thrice-marvellous adventure of
brom bones who made light of the galloping hessian as an arrant jockey
he affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of
sing-sing he had been over taken by this midnight trooper that he had
offered to race with him for a bowl of punch and should have won it
too for daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow but just as they
came to the church bridge the hessian bolted and vanished in a flash of
fire

all these tales told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in
the dark the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving
a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe sank deep in the mind of
ichabod he repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable
author cotton mather and added many marvellous events that had taken
place in his native state of connecticut and fearful sights which he had
seen in his nightly walks about sleepy hollow

the revel now gradually broke up the old farmers gathered together
their families in their wagons and were heard for some time rattling
along the hollow roads and over the distant hills some of the
damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains and their
light-hearted laughter mingling with the clatter of hoofs echoed along
the silent woodlands sounding fainter and fainter until they gradually
died away and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and
deserted ichabod only lingered behind according to the custom of
country lovers to have a tete-a-tete with the heiress fully convinced
that he was now on the high road to success what passed at this
interview i will not pretend to say for in fact i do not know
something however i fear me must have gone wrong for he certainly
sallied forth after no very great interval with an air quite desolate
and chop-fallen oh these women these women could that girl have been
playing off any of her coquettish tricks was her encouragement of the
poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival
heaven only knows not i let it suffice to say ichabod stole forth
with the air of one who had been sacking a hen-roost rather than a fair
lady's heart without looking to the right or left to notice the scene
of rural wealth on which he had so often gloated he went straight to
the stable and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed
most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly
sleeping dreaming of mountains of corn and oats and whole valleys of
timothy and clover

it was the very witching time of night that ichabod heavy-hearted and
crestfallen pursued his travel homewards along the sides of the
lofty hills which rise above tarry town and which he had traversed so
cheerily in the afternoon the hour was as dismal as himself far below
him the tappan zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters with
here and there the tall mast of a sloop riding quietly at anchor under
the land in the dead hush of midnight he could even hear the barking of
the watch-dog from the opposite shore of the hudson but it was so vague
and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful
companion of man now and then too the long-drawn crowing of a cock
accidentally awakened would sound far far off from some farm-house
away among the hills but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear no
signs of life occurred near him but occasionally the melancholy chirp
of a cricket or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog from a
neighboring marsh as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in
his bed

all the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon
now came crowding upon his recollection the night grew darker and
darker the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky and driving clouds
occasionally had them from his sight he had never felt so lonely and
dismal he was moreover approaching the very place where many of the
scenes of the ghost-stories had been laid in the centre of the road
stood an enormous tulip tree which towered like a giant above all the
other trees of the neighborhood and formed a kind of landmark its limbs
were gnarled and fantastic large enough to form trunks for ordinary
trees twisting down almost to the earth and rising again into the air
it was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate andre who
had been taken prisoner hard by and was universally known by the name
of major andre's tree the common people regarded it with a mixture of
respect and superstition partly out of sympathy for the fate of its
ill-starred namesake and partly from the tales of strange sights and
doleful lamentations told concerning it

as ichabod approached this fearful tree he began to whistle he thought
his whistle was answered it was but a blast sweeping sharply through
the dry branches as he approached a little nearer he thought he saw
something white hanging in the midst of the tree he paused and ceased
whistling but on looking more narrowly perceived that it was a place
where the tree had been scathed by lightning and the white wood laid
bare suddenly he heard a groan his teeth chattered and his knees
smote against the saddle it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon
another as they were swayed about by the breeze he passed the tree in
safety but new perils lay before him

about two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the road and
ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen known by the name of wiley's
swamp a few rough logs laid side by side served for a bridge over
this stream on that side of the road where the brook entered the wood a
group of oaks and chestnuts matted thick with wild grape-vines threw a
cavernous gloom over it to pass this bridge was the severest trial it
was at this identical spot that the unfortunate andre was captured and
under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen
concealed who surprised him this has ever since been considered a
haunted stream and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to
pass it alone after dark

as he approached the stream his heart began to thump he summoned up
however all his resolution gave his horse half a score of kicks in the
ribs and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge but instead of
starting forward the perverse old animal made a lateral movement and
ran broadside against the fence ichabod whose fears increased with the
delay jerked the reins on the other side and kicked lustily with the
contrary foot it was all in vain his steed started it is true but
it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of
brambles and alder bushes the schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and
heel upon the starveling ribs of old gunpowder who dashed forward
snuffing and snorting but came to a stand just by the bridge with a
suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head
just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the
sensitive ear of ichabod in the dark shadow of the grove on the margin
of the brook he beheld something huge misshapen black and towering
it stirred not but seemed gathered up in the gloom like some gigantic
monster ready to spring upon the traveller

the hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror
what was to be done to turn and fly was now too late and besides
what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin if such it was which
could ride upon the wings of the wind summoning up therefore a
show of courage he demanded in stammering accents who are you
he received no reply he repeated his demand in a still more agitated
voice still there was no answer once more he cudgelled the sides
of the inflexible gunpowder and shutting his eyes broke forth with
involuntary fervor into a psalm tune just then the shadowy object of
alarm put itself in motion and with a scramble and a bound stood at
once in the middle of the road though the night was dark and dismal
yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained
he appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and mounted on a black
horse of powerful frame he made no offer of molestation or sociability
but kept aloof on one side of the road jogging along on the blind side
of old gunpowder who had now got over his fright and waywardness

ichabod who had no relish for this strange midnight companion and
bethought himself of the adventure of brom bones with the galloping
hessian now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind the
stranger however quickened his horse to an equal pace ichabod pulled
up and fell into a walk thinking to lag behind the other did the
same his heart began to sink within him he endeavored to resume his
psalm tune but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and
he could not utter a stave there was something in the moody and
dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and
appalling it was soon fearfully accounted for on mounting a rising
ground which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief
against the sky gigantic in height and muffled in a cloak ichabod was
horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless but his horror was
still more increased on observing that the head which should have
rested on his shoulders was carried before him on the pommel of the
saddle his terror rose to desperation he rained a shower of kicks and
blows upon gunpowder hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion
the slip but the spectre started full jump with him away then they
dashed through thick and thin stones flying and sparks flashing at
every bound ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air as he
stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head in the eagerness
of his flight

they had now reached the road which turns off to sleepy hollow but
gunpowder who seemed possessed with a demon instead of keeping up it
made an opposite turn and plunged headlong down hill to the left this
road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter
of a mile where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story and just
beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church

as yet the panic of the steed had given his unskillful rider an apparent
advantage in the chase but just as he had got halfway through the
hollow the girths of the saddle gave away and he felt it slipping from
under him he seized it by the pommel and endeavored to hold it firm
but in vain and had just time to save himself by clasping old gunpowder
round the neck when the saddle fell to the earth and he heard it
trampled under foot by his pursuer for a moment the terror of hans van
ripper's wrath passed across his mind for it was his sunday saddle but
this was no time for petty fears the goblin was hard on his haunches
and unskilled rider that he was he had much ado to maintain his seat
sometimes slipping on one side sometimes on another and sometimes
jolted on the high ridge of his horse's back-bone with a violence that
he verily feared would cleave him asunder

an opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church
bridge was at hand the wavering reflection of a silver star in the
bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken he saw the walls
of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond he recollected the
place where brom bones ghostly competitor had disappeared if i can
but reach that bridge thought ichabod i am safe just then he heard
the black steed panting and blowing close behind him he even fancied
that he felt his hot breath another convulsive kick in the ribs and
old gunpowder sprang upon the bridge he thundered over the resounding
planks he gained the opposite side and now ichabod cast a look behind
to see if his pursuer should vanish according to rule in a flash of
fire and brimstone just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups
and in the very act of hurling his head at him ichabod endeavored to
dodge the horrible missile but too late it encountered his cranium
with a tremendous crash he was tumbled headlong into the dust and
gunpowder the black steed and the goblin rider passed by like a
whirlwind

the next morning the old horse was found without his saddle and with
the bridle under his feet soberly cropping the grass at his master's
gate ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast dinner-hour
came but no ichabod the boys assembled at the school-house and
strolled idly about the banks of the brook but no schoolmaster hans van
ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor
ichabod and his saddle an inquiry was set on foot and after diligent
investigation they came upon his traces in one part of the road leading
to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt the tracks of
horses hoofs deeply dented in the road and evidently at furious speed
were traced to the bridge beyond which on the bank of a broad part of
the brook where the water ran deep and black was found the hat of the
unfortunate ichabod and close beside it a spattered pumpkin

the brook was searched but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be
discovered hans van ripper as executor of his estate examined the
bundle which contained all his worldly effects they consisted of two
shirts and a half two stocks for the neck a pair or two of worsted
stockings an old pair of corduroy small-clothes a rusty razor a book
of psalm tunes full of dog's ears and a broken pitch-pipe as to the
books and furniture of the school-house they belonged to the community
excepting cotton mather's history of witchcraft a new england almanac
and a book of dreams and fortune-telling in which last was a sheet of
foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to
make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of van tassel these magic
books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames
by hans van ripper who from that time forward determined to send his
children no more to school observing that he never knew any good
come of this same reading and writing whatever money the schoolmaster
possessed and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or
two before he must have had about his person at the time of his
disappearance

the mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the
following sunday knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the
churchyard at the bridge and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin
had been found the stories of brouwer of bones and a whole budget of
others were called to mind and when they had diligently considered them
all and compared them with the symptoms of the present case they shook
their heads and came to the conclusion that ichabod had been carried
off by the galloping hessian as he was a bachelor and in nobody's debt
nobody troubled his head any more about him the school was removed to
a different quarter of the hollow and another pedagogue reigned in his
stead

it is true an old farmer who had been down to new york on a visit
several years after and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure
was received brought home the intelligence that ichabod crane was still
alive that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the
goblin and hans van ripper and partly in mortification at having been
suddenly dismissed by the heiress that he had changed his quarters to a
distant part of the country had kept school and studied law at the same
time had been admitted to the bar turned politician electioneered
written for the newspapers and finally had been made a justice of
the ten pound court brom bones too who shortly after his rival's
disappearance conducted the blooming katrina in triumph to the altar
was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of ichabod
was related and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the
pumpkin which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter
than he chose to tell

the old country wives however who are the best judges of these
matters maintain to this day that ichabod was spirited away by
supernatural means and it is a favorite story often told about the
neighborhood round the intervening fire the bridge became more than
ever an object of superstitious awe and that may be the reason why the
road has been altered of late years so as to approach the church by the
border of the mill-pond the schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to
decay and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate
pedagogue and the plough-boy loitering homeward of a still summer
evening has often fancied his voice at a distance chanting a melancholy
psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of sleepy hollow


postscript

found in the handwriting of mr knickerbocker

the preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which i heard
it related at a corporation meeting of the ancient city of manhattoes
at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers
the narrator was a pleasant shabby gentlemanly old fellow in
pepper-and-salt clothes with a sadly humorous face and one whom
i strongly suspected of being poor he made such efforts to be
entertaining when his story was concluded there was much laughter and
approbation particularly from two or three deputy aldermen who had
been asleep the greater part of the time there was however one tall
dry-looking old gentleman with beetling eyebrows who maintained a
grave and rather severe face throughout now and then folding his arms
inclining his head and looking down upon the floor as if turning a
doubt over in his mind he was one of your wary men who never laugh but
upon good grounds when they have reason and the law on their side
when the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided and silence was
restored he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair and sticking the
other akimbo demanded with a slight but exceedingly sage motion of the
head and contraction of the brow what was the moral of the story and
what it went to prove

the story-teller who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips as a
refreshment after his toils paused for a moment looked at his inquirer
with an air of infinite deference and lowering the glass slowly to the
table observed that the story was intended most logically to prove 

that there is no situation in life but has its advantages and
pleasures provided we will but take a joke as we find it

that therefore he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to
have rough riding of it

ergo for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a dutch
heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state

the cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this
explanation being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism
while methought the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a
triumphant leer at length he observed that all this was very well but
still he thought the story a little on the extravagant there were one
or two points on which he had his doubts

faith sir replied the story-teller as to that matter i don't
believe one-half of it myself

 chaucer's belle dame sans mercie

in concluding a second volume of the sketch book the author cannot but
express his deep sense of the indulgence with which his first has been
received and of the liberal disposition that has been evinced to treat
him with kindness as a stranger even the critics whatever may be
said of them by others he has found to be a singularly gentle and
good-natured race it is true that each has in turn objected to some
one or two articles and that these individual exceptions taken in the
aggregate would amount almost to a total condemnation of his work but
then he has been consoled by observing that what one has particularly
censured another has as particularly praised and thus the encomiums
being set off against the objections he finds his work upon the whole
commended far beyond its deserts


 closing the second volume of the london edition


he is aware that he runs a risk of forfeiting much of this kind favor by
not following the counsel that has been liberally bestowed upon him for
where abundance of valuable advice is given gratis it may seem a man's
own fault if he should go astray he only can say in his vindication
that he faithfully determined for a time to govern himself in his second
volume by the opinions passed upon his first but he was soon brought to
a stand by the contrariety of excellent counsel one kindly advised him
to avoid the ludicrous another to shun the pathetic a third assured
him that he was tolerable at description but cautioned him to leave
narrative alone while a fourth declared that he had a very pretty knack
at turning a story and was really entertaining when in a pensive mood
but was grievously mistaken if he imagined himself to possess a spirit
of humor

thus perplexed by the advice of his friends who each in turn closed
some particular path but left him all the world beside to range in
he found that to follow all their counsels would in fact be to stand
still he remained for a time sadly embarrassed when all at once the
thought struck him to ramble on as he had begun that his work being
miscellaneous and written for different humors it could not be expected
that any one would be pleased with the whole but that if it should
contain something to suit each reader his end would be completely
answered few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite
for every dish one has an elegant horror of a roasted pig another
holds a curry or a devil in utter abomination a third cannot tolerate
the ancient flavor of venison and wild-fowl and a fourth of truly
masculine stomach looks with sovereign contempt on those knick-knacks
here and there dished up for the ladies thus each article is in
condemned in its turn and yet amidst this variety of appetites seldom
does a dish go away from the table without being tasted and relished by
some one or other of the guests

with these considerations he ventures to serve up this second volume in
the same heterogeneous way with his first simply requesting the reader
if he should find here and there something to please him to rest
assured that it was written expressly for intelligent readers like
himself but entreating him should he find anything to dislike to
tolerate it as one of those articles which the author has been obliged
to write for readers of a less refined taste

to be serious the author is conscious of the numerous faults and
imperfections of his work and well aware how little he is disciplined
and accomplished in the arts of authorship his deficiencies are also
increased by a diffidence arising from his peculiar situation he finds
himself writing in a strange land and appearing before a public
which he has been accustomed from childhood to regard with the highest
feelings of awe and reverence he is full of solicitude to deserve their
approbation yet finds that very solicitude continually embarrassing his
powers and depriving him of that case and confidence which are necessary
to successful exertion still the kindness with which he is treated
encourages him to go on hoping that in time he may acquire a steadier
footing and thus he proceeds half venturing half shrinking surprised
at his own good-fortune and wondering at his own temerity

every quarter edinburgh has its own peculiar
boast so that the city together combines
within its precincts if you take the word 
the inhabitants on the subject as much variety
as beauty as much historical interest as
 natural sublimity our claims in behalf 
the canongate are not the slightest or least interesting
the castle may excel us in extent
 prospect and natural sublimity site the
canton had always the superiority its unrivalled
panorama and has late added to them
that its towers bridges and triumphal arches
the high street we acknowledge had the distinguished
honour being defended by fortifications
 which we can show no vestiges we will
not descend to notice the claims mere upstart
districts called old new town and new
new town not to mention the favourite moray
place which is the newest new town all
we will not match ourselves except with our
equals and with our equals in age only for indignity
we admit none we boast being the
court the town possessing the palace
and the sepulchral remains ancient monarchs
and that we have the power to excite in a degree
unknown to the less honoured quarters 
the city the dark and solemn recollections 
the ancient grandeur which occupied the precincts
 our venerable abbey from the time 
st david till her deserted halls were once more
made glad and her long silent echoes awakened
by the visit our present gracious sovereign

my long habitation in the neighbourhood
and the quiet respectability my habits have
given me a sort intimacy with good mrs
the housekeeper in that most interesting
part the old building called queen
mary's apartments but a circumstance which
lately happened has conferred upon me greater
privileges so that indeed i might i believe
venture on the exploit chaplet who was
executed for being found secreted at midnight
in the very bedchamber scotland's mistress
it chanced that the good lady i have mentioned
was in the discharge her function
showing the apartments to a cockney from london
 not one your quiet dull commonplace
visitors who gape yawn and listen with an acquiescent
humph to the information doled out by
the provincial cicerone no such thing this was
the brisk alert agent a great house in the city
who missed no opportunity doing business
as he termed it that is putting off the goods
 his hemp oyer and improving his own account
 commission he had fidgeted through
the suite apartments without finding the least
opportunity to touch upon that which he considered
as the principal his existence
even the story rizzio's assassination presented
no ideas to this emissary commerce
until the housekeeper appealed in support 
her narrative to the dusky stains blood upon
the floor
these are the stains she said nothing
will remove them from the place there they
have been for two hundred and fifty years 
and there they will remain while the floor is
left standing neither water nor anything else
will ever remove them from that spot
now our cockney amongst other articles
sold scouring drops as they are called and
a stain two hundred and fifty years standing
was interesting to him not because it had been
caused by the blood a queen's favourite
slain in her apartment but because it offered
so admirable an opportunity to prove the efficacy
 his unequalled detergent elixir down
on his knees went our friend but neither in
horror nor devotion
two hundred and fifty years ma'am and
nothing take it away why if it had been five
hundred i have something in my pocket will
fetch it out in five minutes d'ye see this
elixir ma'am i will show you the stain vanish
in a moment
accordingly whetting one his handkerchief
with the alldeterging specific he began
to rub away on the planks without heeding
the remonstrances mrs she good
soul stood at first in astonishment like the
abbess st bridget's when a profane visitant
drank up the vial brandy which had long
passed muster among the relics the cloister
for the tears the blessed saint the venerable
guardian st bridget probably expected
the interference her patroness she
 holy rood might perhaps hope that david
rizzio's spectre would arise to prevent the
profanation but mrs stood not long in
the silence horror she uplifted her voice
and screamed as loudly as queen mary herself
when the dreadful deed was in the act perpetration

harrow now out and walawa she cried
i happened to be taking my morning walk in
the adjoining gallery pondering in my mind
why the kings scotland who hung around
me should be each and every one painted with
a nose like the knocker a door when lo the
walls once more reechoed with such shrieks as
formerly were as often heard in the scottish
palaces as were sounds revelry and music
somewhat surprised at such an alarm in a place
so solitary i hastened to the spot and found
the wellmeaning traveller scrubbing the floor
like a housemaid while mrs dragging
him by the skirts the coat in vain endeavoured
to divert him from his sacrilegious purpose
it cost me some trouble to explain to the
zealous purifier silkstockings embroidered
waistcoats broadcloth and deal planks that
there were such things in the world as stains
which ought to remain indelible on account
 the associations with which they are connected
our good friend viewed everything oi
the kind only as the means displaying the
virtue his vaunted commodity he comprehended
however that he would not be permitted
to proceed to exemplify its powers on the
present occasion so took his leave muttering
that he had always heard the scots were a
nasty people but had no idea they carried it sofar
as to choose to have the floors their palaces
bloodaltered like banquo's ghost when to
remove them would have cost but a hundred
drops the infallible detergent elixir prepared
and sold by messrs scrub and rub in five
shilling and ten shilling bottles each bottle being
marked with the initials the inventor to
counterfeit which would be to incur the pains
 forgery
freed from the odious presence this lover
 cleanliness my good friend mrs was
profuse in her expressions thanks and
yet her gratitude instead exhausting itself
in these declarations according to the way 
the world continues as lively at this moment
as if she had never thanked me at all it is
owing to her recollection this piece good
service that i have the permission wandering
like the ghost some departed gentlemanusher
through these deserted halls sometimes
as the old irish ditty expresses it
thinking on things that are long enough ago 
and sometimes wishing i could with the good
luck most editors romantic narrative
light upon some hidden crypt or massive antique
cabinet which should yield to my researches
an almost illegible manuscript containing
the authentic particulars some the
strange deeds those wild days the unhappy
mary
my dear mrs baliol used to sympathize with
me when i regretted that all the godsend 
this nature had ceased to occur and that an author
might chatter his teeth to pieces by the
seaside without a wave ever wafting to him a
casket containing such a history as that automatic
 that he might break his shins in
stumbling through a hundred vaults without
finding anything but rats and mice and become
the tenant a dozen sets shabby tenements
without seeing any manuscript but the weekly
bill for board and lodging a dairymaid 
these degenerate days might as well wash and
deck her dairy in hopes finding the fairy tester
in her shoe
it is a sad and too true a tale cousin
said mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasion
to regret the want these ready supplements
to a failing invention but you most 
all have right to complain that the fairies have
not favoured your researches you who have
shown the world that the age chivalry still
exists you the knight croftangry who
braved the fury the london prentice bold
in behalf the fair dame and the memorial
 rizzio's slaughter is it not a pity cousin
considering the feat chivalry was otherwise
so much according to rule is it not i
say a great pity that the lady had not been a
little younger and the legend a little older 
why as to the age at which a fair dame
loses the benefits chivalry and is no longer
entitled o crave boon brave knight that i
u
leave to the statutes the order errantry 
but for the blood rizzio i take up the gauntlet
and maintain against all and sundry that i
hold the stains to be no modern date but
to have been actually the consequence and the
record that terrible assassination
as i cannot accept the challenge to the
field fair cousin i am contented to require
proof
the unaltered tradition the palace and
the correspondence the existing state things
with that tradition
explain if you please
i will the universal tradition bears that
when rizzio was dragged out the chamber 
the queen the heat and fury the assassins
who struggled which should deal him most
wounds dispatched him at the door the anteroom
there therefore the greater quantity
 the blood was spilled and there the marks 
it are still shown it is reported further by historians
that mary continued her entreaties for
his life mingling her prayers with screams and
exclamations until she knew that he was assuredly
slain on which she wiped her eyes and
said i will now study revenge 
all this is granted but the blood would
it not wash out or waste out think you in so
many years 
i am coming to that presently the constant
tradition the palace says that mary
discharged any measures to be taken to remove
the marks slaughter which she had resolved
should remain as a memorial to quicken and
confirm her purposed vengeance but it is added
that satisfied with the knowledge that it
existed and not desirous to have the ghastly
evidence always under her eye she caused
a traverse as it is called that is a temporary
screen boards to be drawn along the
under part the anteroom a few feet from
the door so as to separate the place stained
with the blood from the rest the apartment
and involve it in considerable obscurity now
this temporary partition still exists and by
running across and interrupting the plan 
the roof and cornices plainly intimates that it
has been intended to serve some temporary
purpose since it disfigures the proportions 
the room interferes with the ornaments the
ceiling and could only have been put there for
some such purpose as hiding an object too disagreeable
to be looked upon as to the objection
that the bloodstains would have disappeared
in course time i apprehend that if measures
to efface them were not taken immediately
after the affair happened if the blood in
other words were allowed to sink into the
wood the stain would become almost indelible
now not to mention that our scottish palaces
were not particularly well washed in those days
and that there were no patent drops to assist
the labours the mop i think it very probable
that these dark relics might subsist for a long
course time even if mary had not desired or directed
that they should be preserved but screened
by the traverse from public sight i know
several instances similar bloodstains remaining
for a great many years and i doubt whether
after a certain time anything can remove
them save the carpenter's plane if any seneschal
by way increasing the interest the
apartments had by means paint or any other
mode imitation endeavoured to palm upon
posterity supposititious stigmata i conceive that
the impostor would have chosen the queers cabinet
and the bedroom for the scene his trick
placing his bloody tracery where it could be distinctly
seen by visitors instead hiding it behind
the traverse in this manner the existence
 the said traverse or temporary partition is
also extremely difficult to be accounted for if the
common and ordinary tradition be rejected in
short all the rest this striking locality is so
true to the historical fact that i think it may
well bear out the additional circumstance the
blood on the floor
 i profess to you answered mrs baliol
that i am very willing to be converted to
your faith we talk a credulous vulgar
without always recollecting that there is a vulgar
incredulity which in historical matters as
well as in those religion finds it easier to
doubt than to examine and endeavours to assume
the credit an esprit fort by denying
o
whatever happens to be a little beyond the very
limited comprehension the sceptic and so
that point being settled and you possessing as
we understand the open sesamum into these
secret apartments how if we may ask do you
intend to avail yourself your privilege 
do you propose to pass the night in the royal
bedchamber 
for what purpose my dear lady if to
improve the rheumatism this east wind may
serve the purpose
improve the rheumatism heaven forbid 
that would be worse than adding colours to the
violet no i mean to recommend a night on
the couch the rose scotland merely to
improve the imagination who knows what
dreams might be produced by a night spent ina
mansion so many memories for aught i
know the iron door the postern stair might
open at the dead hour midnight and as at the
time the conspiracy forth might sally the
phantom assassins with stealthy step and ghastly
look to renew the semblance the deed
there comes the fierce fanatic ruthven party
hatred enabling him to bear the armour which
would otherwise weigh down a form extenuated
by wasting disease see how his writhen
features show under the hollow helmet like
those a corpse tenanted by a demon whose
vindictive purpose looks out at the flashing eyes
while the visage has the stillness death 
yonder appears the tall form the boy darnley
as goodly in person as vacillating in resolution
 yonder he advances with hesitating step
and yet more hesitating purpose his childish
fear having already overcome his childish passion
he is in the plight a mischievous boy
who has fired a mine and who now expecting
the explosion in remorse and terror would give
his life to quench the train which his own hand
lighted yonder yonder but i forget the
rest the worthy cutthroats help me if
you can
summon up said i the postulate
george douglas the most active the gang
let him arise at your call the claimant 
wealth which he does not possess the partaker
 the illustrious blood douglas but which
vol i b
in his veins is sullied with illegitimacy paint
him the ruthless the daring the ambitious so
nigh greatness yet debarred from it so near
to wealth yet excluded from possessing it a
political tantalus ready to do or dare anything
to terminate his necessities and assert his imperfect
claims
admirable my dear croftangry but what
is a postulate 
pooh my dear madam you disturb the
current my ideas the postulate was in
scottish phrase the candidate for some benefice
which he had not yet attained george douglas
who stabbed rizzio was the postulate for
the temporal possessions the rich abbey 
arbroath
i stand informed come proceed who
comes next
who comes next yon tall thinmade 
man with the petronel in his hand
must be andrew er alongside a brother's
son i believe the celebrated sir david
er cessford his look and bearing those
 a border freebooter his disposition so savage
that during the fray in the cabinet he presented
his loaded piece at the bosom the young
and beautiful queen that queen also being
within a few weeks becoming a mother
bravo beau cousin well having raised
your bevy phantoms i hope you do not intend
to send them back to their cold beds to
warm them you will put them to some action
and since you do threaten the canongate with
your desperate quill you surely mean to novelist
or to dramatize if you will this most singular
 all tragedies 
worse that is less interesting periods 
history have been indeed shown up for furnishing
amusement to the peaceable ages which
have succeeded but dear lady the events are
too well known in mary's days to be used as
vehicles romantic fiction what can a better
writer than myself add to the elegant and forcible
narrative robertson so adieu to my
vision i awake like john bunyan and behold
it is a dream well enough that i awake
without a sciatica which would have probably
rewarded my slumbers had i profaned queen
mary's bed by using it as a mechanical resource
to awaken a torpid imagination
this will never do cousin answered mrs
baliol you must get over all these scruples if
you would thrive in the character a romantic
historian which you have determined to embrace
what is the classic robertson to you the
light which he carried was that a lamp to illuminate
the dark events antiquity yours is
a magic lantern to raise up wonders which never
existed no reader sense wonders at your
historical inaccuracies any more than he does
to see punch in the showbox seated on the
same throne with king solomon in his glory
or to hear him hallowing out to the patriarch
amid the deluge mighty hazy weather master
noah 
do not mistake me my dear madam said
i i am quite conscious my own immunities
as a taleteller but even the mendacious
mr fang assures us that though he never scruples
to tell a lie at his master's command yet it
hurts his conscience to be found out now
this is the reason why i avoid in prudence all
wellknown paths history where every one
can read the fingerposts carefully set up to advise
them the right turning and the very
boys and girls who learn the history britain
by way question and answer hoot at a poor
author if he abandons the highway
m do not be discouraged however cousin
chrystal there are plenty wildernesses in
scottish history through which unless i am
greatly misinformed no certain paths have
been laid down from actual survey but which
are only described by imperfect tradition which
fills up with wonders and with legends the periods
in which no real events are recognized to
have taken place even thus as mat prior
says 
geographers on pathless downs
place elephants for want towns 
if such be your advice my dear lady said
i the course my story shall take its rise
upon this occasion at a remote period history
and in a province removed from my natural
sphere the canongate
it was under the influence those feelings
that i undertook the following historical romance
which often suspended and flung aside
is now arrived at a size too important to be
altogether thrown away although there may belittle
prudence in sending it to the press
i have not placed in the mouth the characters
the lowland scotch dialect now spoken
because unquestionably the scottish that day
resembled very closely the anglosaxon with
a sprinkling french or norman to enrich it
those who wish to investigate the subject may
consult the chronicles wanton and the history
 bruce by archdeacon barbour but
supposing my own skill in the ancient scottish
were sufficient to invest the dialogue with its
peculiarities a translation must have been necessary
for the benefit the general reader
the scottish dialect may be therefore considered
as laid aside unless where the use peculiar
words may add emphasis or vivacity to the
composition
aunt valentine's bay 
the fair maid perth
chapter i
behold the tiber the vain roman cried
viewing the ample tay from beglie's side 
but where's the scot that would the vaunt repay
and hail the puny tiber for the tay 
among all the provinces in scotland if an
intelligent stranger were asked to describe the
most varied and the most beautiful it is probable
he would name the county perth a
native also any other district though his partialities
might lead him to prefer his native
county in the first instance would certainly
class that perth in the second and thus give
its inhabitants a fair right to plead that prejudice
apart perthshire forms the fairest portion
 caledonia it is long since lady mary
worsley montague with that excellent taste
which characterises her writings expressed her
opinion that the most interesting portion 
every country and that which exhibits the varied
beauties natural scenery in greatest perfection
is that where the mountains sink down
upon the champaign or more level land the
most picturesque if not the highest hills are to
be found there the rivers find their way out
 the mountainous region by the wildest leaps
and through the most romantic passes above
the vegetation a happier climate and soil is
mingled with the magnificent characteristics 
mountainscenery and woods groves and thickets
in profusion clothe the base the hills
ascend up the ravines and mingle with the precipices
it is in such favoured regions that the
traveller finds what the poet gray or some one
else has termed beauty lying in the lap 
terror
from the same advantage situation this
favoured province presents a variety the most
pleasing character its lakes woods and mountains
may vie in beauty with any that the highland
tour exhibits while perthshire contains
amidst this romantic scenery and in some places
in connexion with it many fertile and habitable
tracts which may vie with the richness merry
england herself the country has also been
the scene many remarkable exploits and events
some historical importance others interesting
to the poet and romancer though recorded
in popular tradition alone it was in these vales
that the saxons the plain and the gael the
mountains had many a desperate and bloody
encounter in which it was frequently impossible
to decide the palm victory between the
mailed chivalry the low country and the
plaided clans whom they opposed
perth so eminent for the beauty its situation
is a place great antiquity and old tradition
assigns to the town the importance a
roman foundation that victorious nation it
is said pretended to recognize the tiber in the
much more magnificent and navigable tay and
to acknowledge the large level space well known
by the name the north inch as having a near
resemblance to their campus martins the city
was often the residence our monarchs who
although they had no palace at perth found
the cistercian convent amply sufficient for the
reception their court it was here that james
the first one the wisest and best the
scottish kings fell a victim to the jealousy 
the vengeful aristocracy here also occurred
the mysterious conspiracy gowrie the scene
 which has only late been effaced by the
destruction the ancient palace in which the
tragedy was acted the antiquarian society 
perth with just zeal for the objects their
pursuit have published an accurate plan this
memorable mansion with some remarks upon
its connexion with the narrative the plot
which display equal acuteness and candour
one the most beautiful points view
which britain or perhaps the world can afford
is or rather we may say was the prospect from
a spot called the wicks beglie being a species
 niche at which the traveller arrived after
a long stage from kinross through a waste
and uninteresting country and from which as
forming a pass over the summit a ridgy eminence
which he had gradually surmounted he
beheld stretching beneath him the valley the
tay traversed by its ample and lordly stream 
the town perth with its two large meadows
or inches its steeples and its towers the hills 
moncrieff and kinnoul faintly rising into picturesque
rocks partly clothed with woods the rich
margin the river studded with elegant mansions
 and the distant view the huge grampian
mountains the northern screen this exquisite
landscape the alteration the road
greatly it must be owned to the improvement
 general intercourse avoids this magnificent
point view and the landscape is introduced
more gradually and partially to the eye though
the approach must be still considered as extremely
beautiful there is still we believe a footpath
left open by which the station at the wicks 
beglie may be approached and the traveller
by quitting his horse or equipage and walking
a few hundred yards may still compare the
real landscape with the sketch which we have
attempted to give but it is not in our power
to communicate or in his to receive the exquisite
charm which surprise gives to pleasure
when so splendid a view arises when least expected
or hoped for and which chrystal croftangry
experienced when he beheld for the first
time the matchless scene
childish wonder indeed was an ingredient
in my delight for i was not above fifteen years
old and as this had been the first excursion
which i was permitted to make on a pony my
own i also experienced the glow independence
mingled with that degree anxiety
which the most conceited boy feels when he is
first abandoned to his own undirected counsels
i recollect pulling up the reins without meaning
to do so and gazing on the scene before me as
if i had been afraid it would shift like those in a
theatre before i could distinctly observe its different
parts or convince myself that what i saw
was real since that hour and the period is
now more than fifty years past the recollection
 that inimitable landscape has possessed the
strongest influence over my mind and retained
its place as a memorable thing when much that
was influential on my own fortunes has fled
from my recollection it is therefore natural
that whilst deliberating on what might be
brought forward for the amusement the public
i should pitch upon some narrative connected
with the splendid scenery which made so
much impression on my youthful imagination
and which may perhaps have that effect in setting
off the imperfections the composition which
ladies suppose a fine set china to possess in
heightening the flavour indifferent tea
the period at which i propose to commence
is however considerably earlier than either 
the remarkable historical transactions to which
i have already alluded as the events which i
am about to recount occurred during the last
years the fourteenth century when the scottish
sceptre was swayed by the gentle but feeble
hand john who reigned under the title 
robert the third

chapter 
perth boasting as we have already mentioned
so large a portion the beauties inanimate
nature has at no time been without its
own share those charms which are at once
more interesting and more transient to be called
the fair maid perth would at any period
have been a high distinction and have inferred
no mean superiority in beauty where there
were many to claim that muchenvied attribute
but in the feudal times to which we now call
the reader's attention female beauty was a quality
 much higher importance than it has been
since the ideas chivalry have been in a great
measure extinguished the love the ancient
cavaliers was a licensed species idolatry
which the love heaven alone was theoretically
supposed to approach in intensity and which
in practice it seldom equalled god and the ladies
were familiarly appealed to in the same
breath and devotion to the fair sex was as peremptorily
enjoined upon the aspirant to the
honour chivalry as that which was due to
heaven at such a period in society the power
 beauty was almost unlimited it could level
the highest rank with that which was immeasurably
inferior
it was but in the reign preceding that 
robert iii that beauty alone had elevated a
person inferior rank and indifferent morals to
share the scottish throne and many women less
artful or less fortunate had risen to greatness
from a state concubinage for which the manners
 the times made allowance and apology
such views might have dazzled a girl higher
birth than catharine or katie glover who was
universally acknowledged to be the most beautiful
young woman the city or its vicinity and
whose renown as the fair maid perth had
drawn on her much notice from the young gallants
 the royal court when it chanced to be
residing in or near perth insomuch that more
than one nobleman the highest rank and most

distinguished for deeds chivalry were more
attentive to exhibit feats horsemanship as
they passed the door old simon glover in
what was called couvrefew or curfew street
than to distinguish themselves in the tournaments
where the noblest dames scotland
were spectators their address
but the glover's daughter for as was common
with citizens and artizans that early
period her father simon derived his sirname
from the trade which he practised showed
no inclination to listen to any gallantry which
came from those a station highly exalted
above that which she herself occupied and
though probably in no degree insensible to her
personal charms seemed desirous to confine her
conquests to those who were within her own
sphere life indeed her beauty being 
that kind which we connect more with the
mind than with the person was notwithstanding
her natural kindness and gentleness disposition
rather allied to reserve than to gaiety
even when in company with her equals 
vol i c
and the earnestness with which she attended
upon the exercises devotion induced many
to think that catharine glover nourished the
private wish to retire from the world and bury
herself in the recesses the cloister but to
such a sacrifice should it be meditated it was
not to be expected her father reputed a wealthy
man and having this only child would yield a
willing consent
in her resolution avoiding the addresses 
the gallant courtiers the reigning beauty 
perth was confirmed by the sentiments her
parent let them go he said let them go
catharine those gallants with their capering
horses their jingling spurs their plumed bonnets
and their trim moustaches they are not 
our class nor will we aim at pairing with them
tomorrow is saint valentine's day when
every bird chooses her mate but you will not
see the linnet pair with the sparrowhawk nor
the robin redbreast with the kite my father
was an honest burgher perth and could use
his needle as well as i can did there come
war to the gates our fair burgh down went
needles thread and shandy leather and out
came the good headpiece and target from the
dark nook and the long lance from above the
chimney show me a day that either he or i
were absent when the provost made his musters
 thus we have led our lives my girl
working to win our bread and fighting to defend
it i will have no soninlaw that thinks
himself better than me and for these lords and
knights i trust thou wilt always remember
thou art too low to be their lawful love and too
high to be their unlawful loon and now lay
by thy work lass for it is holytide eve and it
becomes us to go to the evening service and
pray that heaven may send thee a good valentine
tomorrow
so the fair maid perth laid aside the
splendid hawking glove which she was embroidering
for the lady drummond and putting on
her holiday kirtle prepared to attend her father
to the blackfriars monastery which was adjacent
to couvrefew street in which they lived
on their passage simon glover an ancient and
esteemed burgess perth somewhat stricken
in years and increased in substance received
from young and old the homage due to his velvet
jerkin and his gold chain while the beauty
 catharine though concealed beneath her
screen which resembled the mantilla still worn
in flanders called both obeisance and coffins
 the bonnet from young and old
as the pair moved on arm in arm they were
followed by a tall handsome young man dressed
in a yeoman's habit the plainest kind but
which showed to advantage his fine limbs as
the handsome countenance that looked out from
a quantity curled tresses surmounted by a
small scarlet bonnet became that species headdress
he had no other weapon than a staff in
his hand it not being thought fit that persons
 his degree for he was an apprentice to the
old glover should appear on the street armed
with sword or dagger a privilege which the jackmen
or military retainers the nobility esteemed
exclusively their own he attended his
master at holytide partly in the character a
domestic or protector should there be cause for
his interference but it was not difficult to discern
by the earnest attention which he paid to
catharine glover that it was to her rather than
to her father that he desired to dedicate his
good offices generally speaking there was no
opportunity for his zeal displaying itself for a
common feeling respect induced passengers
to give way to the father and daughter
but when the steel caps barrels and plumes
 squires archers and menatarms began to be
seen among the throng the wearers these warlike
distinctions were more rude in their demeanour
than the quiet citizens more than once
when from chance or perhaps from an assumption
 superior importance such an individual
took the wall simon in passing the glover's
youthful attendant bristled up with a look defiance
and the air one who sought to distinguish
his zeal in his mistress's service by its ardour
as frequently did conachar for such was
the lad's name receive a check from his master
who gave him to understand that he did not
wish his interference before he required it
foolish boy he said hast thou not lived
long enough in my shop to know that a blow
will breed a brawl that a dirk will cut the skin
as fast as a needle pierces leather that i love
peace though i never feared war and care not
which side the causeway my daughter and i
walk upon so we may keep our road in peace
and quietness conachar excused himself as
zealous for his master's honour yet was scarce
able to pacify the old citizen what have we
to do with honour said simon glover if
thou wouldst remain in my service thou must
think honesty and leave honour to the swaggering
fools who wear spurs at their heels and
iron on their shoulders if you wish to wear
and use such garniture you are welcome but it
shall not be in my house or in my company
conachar seemed rather to kindle at this rebuke
than to submit to it but a sign from catharine
if that slight raising her little finger
was indeed a sign had more effect than the
angry reproof his master and the youth
laid aside the military air which seemed natural
to him and relapsed into the humble follower
 a quiet burgher
meantime the little party were overtaken by
a tall young man wrapped in a cloak which obscured
or muffled a part his face a practice
often used by the gallants the time when
they did not wish to be known or were abroad
in quest adventures he seemed in short
one who might say to the world around him
u i desire for the present not to be known
or addressed in my own character but as i
am answerable to myself alone for my actions i
wear my incognito but for form's sake and care
little whether you see through it or not he
came on the right side catharine who had
hold her father's arm and slackened his pace
as if joining their party
good even to you goodman
the same to your worship and thanks 
may i pray you to pass on our pace is too slow
for that your lordship our company too
mean for that your father's son
my father's son can best judge that old
man i have business to talk with you and
with my fair st catharine here the loveliest
and most obdurate saint in the calendar
with deep reverence my lord said the
old man i would remind you that this is
good st valentine's eve which is no time for
business and that i can have your worshipful
commands by your serving man as early as it
pleases you to send them
there is no time like the present said the
persevering youth whose rank seemed to be 
a kind which set him above ceremony i wish
to know whether the buff doublet be finished
which i commissioned some time since 
and from you pretty catharine here he sank
his voice to a whisper i desire to be informed
whether your fair fingers have been employed
upon it agreeably to your promise but i need
not ask you for my poor heart has felt the pang
 each puncture that pierced the garment which
was to cover it traitress how wilt thou answer
for thus tormenting the heart that loves
thee so dearly 
let me entreat you my lord to forego this
wild talk it becomes not you to speak thus
or me to listen we are poor rank but honest
manners and the presence the father
ought to protect the child from such expressions
even from your lordship
this she spoke so low that neither her father
nor conachar could understand what she said
well tyrant answered the persevering
gallant i will plague you no longer now
providing you will let me see you from your
window tomorrow when the sun first peeps
over the eastern hill and give me right to be
your valentine for the year
not so my lord my father has but now
told me that hawks far less eagles pair not
with the humble linnet seek some court lady
to whom your favours will be honour to me 
your highness must permit me to speak the plain
truth they can be nothing but disgrace
as they spoke thus the party arrived at the
gate the church your lordship will i
trust permit us here to take leave you
said her father i am well aware how little
you will alter your pleasure for the pain and
uneasiness you may give to such as us but
from the throng attendants at the gate your
lordship may see that there are others in the
church to whom even your gracious lordship
must pay respect
yes respect and who pays any respect
to me said the haughty young lord a
miserable artizan and his daughter too much
honoured by my slightest notice have the insolence
to tell me that my notice dishonours them
well my princess doeskin and blue silk i
will teach you to rue this
as he murmured thus the glover and his
daughter entered the dominican church and
their attendant conachar in attempting to follow
them closely jostled perhaps not unwillingly
the young nobleman the gallant starting
from his unpleasing reverie and perhaps
considering this as an intentional insult seized
on the young man by the breast struck him
and threw dm from him his irritated opponent
recovered himself with difficulty and
grasped towards his own side as if seeking a
sword or dagger in the place where it was
usually worn but finding none he made a
gesture disappointed rage and entered the
church during the few seconds he remained
the young nobleman stood with his arms folded
on his breast with a haughty smile as if defying
him to do his worst when conachar
had entered the church his opponent adjusting
his cloak yet closer about his face made a
private signal by holding up one his gloves
he was instantly joined by two men who disguised
like himself had waited his motions at
a little distance they spoke together earnestly
after which the young nobleman retired in
one direction his friends or followers going off
in another
simon glover before he entered the church
cast a look towards the group but had taken
his place among the congregation before they
separated themselves he knelt down with the
air a man who has something burthensome on
his mind but when the service was ended he
seemed free from anxiety as one who had referred
himself and his troubles to the disposal
 heaven the ceremony high mass was
performed with considerable solemnity a number
 noblemen and ladies rank being present
preparations had indeed been made for
the reception the good old king himself but
some those infirmities to which he was subject
had prevented robert iii from attending the
service as was his wont when the congregation
were dismissed the glover and his beautiful
daughter lingered for some time for the
purpose making their several shifts in the
confessionals where the priests had taken their
places for discharging that part their duty
thus it happened that the night had fallen dark
and the way was solitary when they returned
along the now deserted streets to their own dwelling
most persons had betaken themselves to
home and to bed they who still lingered in the
street were nightwalkers or revellers the idle
and swaggering retainers the haughty nobles
who were much wont to insult the peaceful passengers
relying on the impunity which their
masters court favour was too apt to secure
them
it was perhaps in apprehension mischief
from some character this kind that conachar
stepping up to the glover said master walk
faster we are dogg'd
dogg'd mayest thou by whom and by
how man 
by one man muffled in his cloak who follows
us like our shadow
then will i never mend my pace along the
couvrefew street for the best one man that ever
trode it
 but he has arms said conachar
and so have we and hands and legs and
feet why sure conachar you are not afraid
 one man 
 afraid answered conachar indignant at
the insinuation you shall soon know if i am
afraid
 now you are as far on the other side the
mark thou foolish boy thy temper has no
middle course there is no occasion to make a
brawl though we do not run walk thou before
with catharine and i will take thy place we
cannot be exposed to danger so near home as
we are
the glover fell behind accordingly and certainly
observed a person keep so close to them
as the time and place considered justified some
suspicion when they crossed the street he
also crossed it and when they advanced or
slackened their pace the stranger's was in proportion
accelerated or diminished the matter
would have been very little consequence had
simon glover been alone but the beauty his
daughter might render her the object some
profligate scheme in a country where the laws
afforded such slight protection to those who had
not the means to defend themselves concha
and his fair charge having arrived on the
threshold their own apartment which was
opened to them by an old female servant the
burgher's uneasiness was ended determined
however to ascertain if possible whether there
had been any cause for it he called out to the
man whose motions had occasioned the alarm
and who stood still though he seemed to keep
out reach the light come step forward
my friend and do not play at bopeep 
knowest thou not that they who walk like
phantoms in the dark are apt to encounter the
conjuration a quarterstaff step forward i
say and show us thy shapes man
why so i can master glover said one 
the deepest voices that ever answered question
i can show shapes well enough only i wish
they could hear the light something better
body me exclaimed simon i should
know that voice and is it thou in thy bodily
person harry gow nay beshrew me if thou
passes this door with dry lips what man
curfew has not rung yet and if it had it were
no reason why it should part father and son
come in man dorothy shall get us something
to eat and we will jingle a can ere thou leave
us come in i say my daughter kate will
be right glad to see thee
by this time he had pulled the person whom
he welcomed so cordially into a sort kitchen
which served also upon ordinary occasions
the office parlour its ornaments were
trenchers pewter mixed with a silver cup
or two which in the highest degree cleanliness
ornamented a range shelves like those
 a beaufort popularly called the sink a
good fire with the assistance a blazing lamp
spread light and cheerfulness through the apartment
and a savoury smell some victuals
which dorothy was preparing did not at all
offend the unrefined noses those whose appetite
they were destined to satisfy
their unknown attendant now stood in full
light among them and though his appearance
was neither dignified nor handsome his face and
figure were not only deserving attention but
seemed in some manner to command it he was
rather below the middle stature but the breadth
 his shoulders length and frankness his
arms and the muscular appearance the whole
man argued a most unusual share strength
and a frame kept in vigour by constant exercise
his legs were somewhat bent but not in a manner
which could be said to approach to deformity 
on the contrary which seemed to correspond
to the strength his frame though it injured
in some degree its symmetry his dress was 
buffhide and he wore in a belt around his
waist a heavy broadsword and a dirk or poniard
as if to defend his purse which burgherfashion
was attached to the same cincture
the head was well proportioned round close
cropped and curled thickly with black hair
there was daring and resolution in the dark
eye but the other features seemed to express
a bashful timidity mingled with good humour
and obvious satisfaction at meeting with his old
friends abstracted from the bashful expression
which was that the moment the forehead
 henry gow or smith for he was indifferently
so called as both words equally indicated
his profession was high and noble
but the lower part the face was less happily
formed the mouth was large and wellfurnished
with a set firm and beautiful teeth the
appearance which corresponded with the air
 personal health and muscular strength which
the whole frame indicated a short thick beard
and moustaches which had lately been arranged
with some care completed the picture his
age could not exceed eightandtwenty
the family appeared all well pleased with
the unexpected appearance an old friend
simon glover shook his hand again and again
vol i u
dorothy made her compliments and catharine
herself offered freely her hand which henry
held in his massive grasp as if he designed to
carry it to his lips but after a moment's hesitation
desisted from fear lest the freedom might
be ill taken not that there was any resistance
on the part the little hand which lay passive
in his grasp but there was a smile mingled
with the blush on her cheek which seemed to
increase the confusion the gallant her father
on his part called out frankly as he saw
his friend's hesitation 
her lips man her lips and that's a proffer
i would not make to every one who crosses my
threshold but by good st valentine whose
holiday will dawn tomorrow i am so glad to
see thee in the bonny city pertly again that
it would be hard to tell the thing i could refuse
thee
the smith for as has been said such was
the craft this sturdy artizan was encouraged
modestly to salute the fair maid who yielded
the courtesy with a smile affection that might
have become a sister saying at the same time
let me hope that i welcome hack to perth a
repentant and amended man
he held her hand as if about to answer then
suddenly as one who lost courage at the moment
relinquished his grasp and drawing
back as if afraid what he had done his dark
countenance glowing with bashfulness mixed
with delight he sate down by the fire on the
opposite side from that which catharine occupied

come dorothy speed thee with the food
old woman and conachar where is conachar

he is gone to bed sir with a headach
said catharine in a hesitating voice
go call him dorothy said the old glover
 i will not be used thus by him his
highland blood forsooth is too gentle to lay a
trencher or spread a napkin and he expects to
enter our ancient and honourable craft without
duly waiting and tending upon his master and
teacher in all matters lawful obedience go
call him i say i will not be thus neglected
dorothy was presently heard screaming upstairs
or more probably up a ladder to the
cockloft to which the recusant apprentice had
made an untimely retreat a muttered answer
was returned and soon after conachar appeared
in the eating apartment there was a gloom
 deep sullenness on his haughty though handsome
features and as he proceeded to spread
the board and arrange the trenchers with salt
spices and other condiments to discharge in
short the duties a modern domestic which
the custom the time imposed upon all apprentices
 he was obviously disgusted and indignant
with the mean office imposed upon him
the fair maid perth looked with some anxiety
at him as if apprehensive that his evident
sullenness might increase her father's displeasure
 but it was not till her eyes had sought
out his for a second time that conachar condescended
to veil his dissatisfaction and throw
a greater appearance willingness and submission
into the services which he was performing

and here we must acquaint our reader that
though the private interchange looks betwixt
catharine glover and the young mountaineer
indicated some interest on the part the former
in the conduct the latter it would have
puzzled the strictest observer to discover whether
that feeling exceeded in degree what might
have been felt by a young person towards a
friend and inmate the same age with whom
she had lived on habits intimacy
thou hast had a long journey son henry
said glover who had always used that affectionate
style speech though noways akin to
the young artizan ay and hast seen many
a river besides tay and many a fair bigging
besides st johnston
but none that i like half so well and none
that are half so much worth my liking answered
the smith i promise you father
that when i crossed the wicks beglie and saw
the bonny city lie stretched fairly before me like
a fairy queen in romance whom the knight
finds asleep among a wilderness flowers i felt
even as a bird when it folds its wearied wings
to stoop down on its own nest
aha so thou canst play the maker yet
said the glover what shall we have our
ballets and our roundels again our lusty caold
scottish tor poet
rots for christmas and our mirthful springs to
trip it round the maypole 
such toys there may be forthcoming father
said henry smith though the blast 
the bellows and the clatter the anvil make
but coarse company to lays minstrelsy but
i can afford them no better since i must mend
my fortune though i mar my verses
right again my own son just answered
the glover and i trust thou has made a saving
voyage it 
nay i made a thriving one father i sold
the steel habergeon that you wot for four
hundred marks to the english warden the
east marches sir magnus median he scarce
scrupled a penny after i gave him leave to try
a sworddint upon it the beggarly highland
thief who bespoke it boggled at half the sum
though it had cost me a year's labour
what dost thou start at conachar said
simon addressing himself by way parenthesis
to the mountain disciple wilt thou
never learn to mind thy own business without
listening to what is passing round thee what
is it to thee that an englishman thinks that
cheap which a scotchman may hold dear 
conachar turned round to speak but after a
moment's consideration looked down and endeavoured
to recover his composure which had
been deranged by the contemptuous manner in
which the smith had spoken his highland
customers henry went on without paying any
attention to him
i sold at high prices seme swords and lingers
when i was at edinburgh they expect war
there and if it please god to send it my merchandize
will be worth its price st dunstan
make us thankful for he was our craft in
short this fellow laying his hand on his purse
who thou knowest father was somewhat lank
and low in condition when i set out four months
since is now as round and full as a sixweeks
porker
and that other leathernsheathed ironhinted
fellow who hangs beside him said the glover
 has he been idle all this while come
jolly smith confess the truth how many brawls
hast thou had since crossing the tay 
nay now you do me wrong father to
ask me such a question glancing a look at catharine
in such a presence answered the armourer
 i make swords indeed but i leave
it to other people to use them no no seldom
have i a naked sword in my fist save when i
am turning them on the anvil or grindstone 
and they slandered me to your daughter catharine
that led her to suspect the quietest burgess
in perth being a brawler i wish the best 
them would dare say such a word at the hill 
kinnoul and never a man on the green but he
and i
ay ay said the glover laughing we
should then have a fine sample your patient
sufferance out upon you henry that you will
speak so like a knave to one who knows thee so
well you look at kate too as if she did not
know that a man in this country must make his
hand keep his head unless he will sleep in slender
security come come beshrew me if thou
hast not spoiled as many suits armour as thou
hast made
why he would be a bad armourer father
simon that could not with his own blow make
proof his own workmanship if i did not
sometimes cleave a helmet or strike a sword's
point through a harness i should not know what
strength fabric to give them and might jingle
together such pasteboard work as yonder
edinburgh smiths think not shame to put out
 their hands
aha now would i lay a gold crown thou
hast had a quarrel with some edinburgh 
upon that very ground 
a quarrel no father replied the perth
armourer but a measuring swords with
such a one upon st leonard's crags for the honour
 my bonny city i confess surely you
do not think i would quarrel with a brother
craftsman 
ah to a surety no but how did your brother
craftsman come off
why as one with a sheet paper on his
bosom might come off from the stroke a lance
or rather indeed he came not off at all for
when i left him he was lying in the hermit's
lodge daily expecting death for which father
jervis said he was in heavenly preparation
well any more measuring weapons 
said the glover

chapter iii
the armourer's heart swelled big with various
and contending sensations so that it seemed
as if it would burst the leathern doublet under
which it was shrouded he arose turned
away his head and extended his hand towards
the glover while he averted his face as if desirous
that his emotion should not be read upon
his countenance
nay hang me if i bid you farewell man
said simon striking the flat his hand against
that which the armourer expanded towards him
i will shake no hands with you for an hour
to come at least tarry but a moment man
and i will explain all this and surely a few
drops blood from a scratch and a few silly
words from a foolish wench's lips are not to
part father and son when they have been so
long without meeting stay then man if ever
you would wish for a father's blessing and st
valentine's whose blessed eve this chances to
be
the glover was soon heard loudly summoning
dorothy and after some clanking 
keys and trampling up and down stairs dorothy
appeared bearing three large rummer cups
 green glass which were then esteemed a great
and precious curiosity and the glover followed
with a huge bottle equal at least to three quarts
 these degenerate days here is a cup 
wine henry older by half than i am myself
my father had it in a gift from stout old crabbe
the flemish engineer who defended perth so
stoutly in the minority david the second
we glovers could always do something in war
though our connexion with it was less than yours
who work in steel and iron and my father had
pleased old crabbe some other day i will tell
you how and also how long these bottles were
concealed under ground to save them from the
reiving southron so i will empty a cup to the
soul's health mv honoured father maw his
sins be forgiven him dorothy thou shalt drink
this pledge and then be gone to thy rockloft
i know thine ears are itching girl but i have
that to say which no one must hear save henry
smith the son mine adoption
dorothy did not venture to remonstrate but
taking off her glass or rather her goblet with
good courage retired to her sleeping apartment
according to her master's commands the two
friends were left alone
it grieves me friend henry said simon
filling at the same time his own glass and his
guest's it grieves me from my soul that my
daughter retains this silly humour but alsome
thinks thou nights mend it why wouldst
thou come hither clattering with thy sword and
dagger when the girl is so silly that she cannot
bear the sight these dost thou not remember
that thou hadst a sort quarrel with her
even before thy last departure from perth because
thou wouldst not go like other honest quiet
burghers but must be ever armed like one 
the rascally jackie that wait on the nobility
sure it is time enough for decent burgesses to
arm at the tolling the common bell which
calls us out odin in effeir war
why my good father that was not my
fault but i had no sooner quitted my nag than
i run hither to tell you my return thinking
if it were your will to permit me that i would
get your advice about being mistress catharine's
valentine for the year and then i heard from
mrs dorothy that you were gone to hear mass at
the black friars so i thought i would follow
thither partly to hear the same mass with you
and partly our lady and st valentine forgive
me to look upon one who thinks little enough
 me and as you entered the church methought
i saw two or three dangerouslooking
men holding counsel together and gazing at
you and at her and in especial sir john ramorn
whom i knew well enough for all his
disguise and the velvet patch over his eye and
that is not in dread war but in the guise which cjf'eirs
or belongs to war in arms namely offensive and defensive m bodin
in fear war a frequent term in old scottish history and
muniments means arrayed in warlike guise
his cloak so like a serving man's methought
father simon that as you were old and yonder
slip a highlander something too young to do
battle i would even walk quietly after you not
doubting with the tools i had about me to bring
any one to reason that might disturb you in
your way home you know that yourself discovered
me and drew me into the house whether
i would or no otherwise i promise you
i would not have seen your daughter till i had
donned the new jerkin which was made at berwick
after the latest cut nor would i have appeared
before her with these weapons which she
dislikes so much although to say truth so
many are at deadly feud with me for one unhappy
chance or another that it is as needful
for me as for any man in scotland to go by
night with weapons about me
the silly wench never thinks that said
simon glover she never has sense to consider
that in our dear native land scotland
every man deems it his privilege and duty to
avenge his own wrong but harry my boy
thou art to blame for taking her talk so much
to heart i have seen thee bold enough with
other wenches wherefore so still and tonguetied
with her 
because she is something different from
other maidens father glover because she is
not only more beautiful but wiser higher holier
and seems to me as if she were made better
clay than we that approach her i can hold
my head high enough with the rest the lasses
round the maypole but somehow when i approach
catharine i feel myself an earthly
coarse ferocious creature scarce worthy to look
on her much less to contradict the precepts
which she expounds to me
il you are an imprudent merchant harry
smith replied simon and rate too high
the goods you wish to purchase catharine is
a good girl and my daughter but if you make
her a conceited ape by your bashfulness and your
flattery neither you nor i will see our wishes
accomplished
i i often fear it my good father said the
smith for i feel how little i am deserving 
catharine
vol i
feel a thread's said the glover
feel for me friend smith for catharine and
me think how the poor thing is beset from
morning to night and by what sort persons
even though windows be down and doors shut
we were accosted today by one too powerful
to be named ay and he showed his displeasure
openly because i would not permit him
to gallant my daughter in the church itself
when the priest was saying mass there are
others scarce less reasonable i sometimes wish
that catharine were some degrees less fair that
she might not catch that dangerous sort admiration
or somewhat less holy that she might
sit down like an honest woman contented with
stout henry smith who could protect his wife
against every sprig chivalry in the court 
scotland
and if i did not said henry thrusting out
a hand and arm which might have belonged to
a giant for bone and muscle i would i may
never bring hammer upon anvil again ay
an it were come but that length my fair catharine
should see that there is no harm in a man
having the trick defence but i believe she
thinks the whole world is one great minsterchurch
and that all who live in it should behave
as if they were at an eternal mass
nay in truth said the father she has
strange influence over those who approach her 
the highland lad conachar with whom i have
been troubled for these two or three years although
you may see he has the natural spirit 
his people obeys the least sign which catharine
makes him and indeed will hardly be
ruled by any one else in the house she takes
much pains with him to bring him from his rude
highland habits
here harry smith became uneasy in his chair
lifted the flaggon set it down and at length exclaimed
 the devil take the young highland
whelp and his whole kindred what has catharine
to do to instruct such a fellow as he 
he will be just like the wolfcub that i was fool
enough to train to the offices a dog and everyone
thought him reclaimed till in an ill hour
i went to walk on the hill moncrieff when
he broke loose on the laird's flock and made
a havock that i might well have rued had the
laird not wanted harness at the time and i
marvel that you being a sensible man father
glover will keep this highland young fellow
a likely one i promise you so nigh to catharine
as if there were no other than your daughter
to serve him for a schoolmistress
fie my son fie now you are jealous
said simon a poor young fellow who to
tell you the truth resides here because he may
not so well live on the other side the hill
ay ay father simon retorted the smith
who had all the narrowminded feelings the
burghers his time an it were not for fear
 offence i would say that you have even too
much packing and peeling with yonder loons
out burgh
i must get my deerhides kidskins and
so forth somewhere my good harry and
highlandmen give good bargains
they can afford them replied henry
drily for they sell nothing but stolen gear
well well be that as it may it is not my
business where they get the bestial so i get
the hides but as i was saying there are certain
considerations why i am willing to oblige
the father this young man by keeping him
here and he is but half a highlander neither
and wants a thought the dour spirit a
glueamie after all i have seldom seen him
so fierce as he showed himself but now
you could not unless he had killed his
man replied the smith in the same dry tone
nevertheless if you wish it harry i'll set
all other respects aside and send the landholder
to seek other quarters tomorrow morning
nay father said the smith you cannot
suppose that harry gow cares the value a
smithydander for such a cub as yonder catmountain
 i care little i promise you though all
his clan were coming down the shoe gate with
slogan crying and pipes playing i would find
fifty blades and bucklers would send them back
faster than they came but to speak truth
though it is a fool's speech too i care not to
see the fellow so much with catharine res
cinder
member lather glover your trade keeps your
eyes and hands close employed and must have
your heedful care even if this lazy lurdane
wrought at it which you know yourself he seldom
does
and that is true said simon he cuts
all his gloves out for the right hand and never
could finish a pair in his life
no doubt his notions skincutting are
rather different said henry but with your
leave father i would only say that work he
or be he idle he has no bleared eyes no hands
seared with the hot iron and walked by the
use the forehammer no hair rusted in the
smoke and singed in the furnace like the hide
 a badger rather than what is fit to be covered
with a christian bonnet now let catharine
be as good a wench as ever lived and i will uphold
her to be the best in perth yet she must
see and know that these things make a difference
betwixt man and man and that the difference
is not in my favour
here is to thee with all my heart son
harry said the old man filling a brimmer to
hi companion and another to himself u i see
that good smith as thou art thou keenest not
the mettle that women are made thou must
be bold henry and bear thyself not as if thou
wert going to the gallowlee but like a gay young
fellow who knows his own worth and will not
be slighted by the best grandchild eve ever
had catharine is a woman like her mother
and thou thickest foolishly to suppose they are
all set on what pleases the eye their ear must
be pleased too man they must know that he
whom they favour is bold and buxom and
might have the love twenty though he is
seeing for theirs believe an old man women
walk more by what others think than by what
they think themselves and when she asks for
the boldest man in perth whom shall she hear
named but harry burnthewind the best
armourer that ever fashioned weapon on anvil 
why harry smith again the tightest dancer
at the maypole why the lusty smith the
gayest troller ballads why who but harry
gow the best wrestler swordandbuckler
player the king the weaponshowing the
breaker mud horses the tamer wild highlander
 ever more it is thee thee no one
but thee and shall catharine prefer yonder
slip a highland boy to thee pshaw she
might as well make a steel gauntlet out kid's
leather i tell thee conachar is nothing to
her but so far as she would fain prevent the
devil having his due him as other highlander
 god bless her poor thing she would
bring all mankind to better thoughts if she
could
m in which she will fail to a certainty said
the smith who as the reader may have noticed
had no good will to the highland race
i will wager on old nick whom i should
know something he being indeed a worker in
the same element with myself against catharine
on that debate the devil will have the
tartan that is sure enough
ay but catharine replied the glover
hath a second thou knowest little father
clement has taken the young reiver in
hand and he fears a hundred devils as little
as i do a flock geese
 father clement said the smith you
are always making some new saint in this godly
city saint johnston pray who for a
devil's drubber may he be one your hermits
that is trained for the work like a wrestler
for the ring and brings himself to trim by fasting
and penance is he not 
no that is the marvel it said simon 
father clement eats drinks and lives much
like other folks all the rules the church
nevertheless strictly observed
oh i comprehend a buxom priest that
thinks more good living than good lifetipple
a can on eastern's eve to enable him to
face lent has a pleasant in principio and
confesses all the prettiest women about town 
you are on the bowhand still smith i
tell you my daughter and i could nose out either
a fasting hypocrite or a full one but father
clement is neither the one nor the other
but what is he then in heaven's name 
one who is either greatly better than half
his brethren saint johnston put together
or so much worse than the worst them that
it is sin and shame that he is suffered to abide
in the country
methinks it were easy to tell whether hebe
the one or the other said the smith
content you my friend said simon
with knowing that if you judge father clement
by what you see him do and hear him say
you will think him as the best and kindest
man in the world with a comfort for every
man's grief a counsel for every man's difficulty
the rich man's surest guide and the poor man's
best friend but if you listen to what the dominicans
say him he is benedicite here
the glover crossed himself on brow and bosom 
a foul heretic who ought by means earthly
flames to be sent to those which burn eternally

the smith also crossed himself and exclaimed
 saint mary father simon and do you
who are so good and prudent that you have
been called the wise glover perth let your
daughter attend the ministry one who the
saints preserve us may be in league with the
foul fiend himself why was it not a priest
who raised the devil in the meal vermes when
hodge jackson's house was blown down in the
great wind did not the devil appear in the
midst the tay dressed in a priest's scapular
gambolling like a peach amongst the waves
the morning when our stately bridge was swept
away 
i cannot tell whether he did or no said
the glover i only know i saw him not as
to catharine she cannot be said to use father
clement's ministry seeing her confessor is old
father francis the dominican from whom she
had her shrift today but women will sometimes
be wilful and sure enough she consults
with father clement more than i could wish 
and yet when i have spoken with him myself
i have thought him so good and holy a man
that i could have trusted my own salvation with
him there are bad reports him among the
dominicans that is certain but what have we
laymen to do with such things my son let us
pay mother church her dues give our alms
confess and do our penances duly and the
saints will bear us out
ay truly and they will have consideration
 said the smith for any rash and unhappy
blow that a man may deal in a fight
when his party was on defence and standing
up to him and that's the only creed a man
can live upon in scotland let your daughter
think what she pleases marry a man must
know his fence or have a short lease his life
in any place where blows are going so rife five
nobles to our altar have cleared me for the best
man i ever had misfortune with
let us finish our flask then said the old
glover for i reckon the dominican tower is
tolling midnight and hark thee son henry beat
the lattice win do won our eastgableby the very
peep dawn and make me aware thou art come
by whistling the smith's call gently i will contrive
that catharine shall look out at the window
and thus thou wilt have all the privileges
 being a gallant valentine through the rest 
the year which if thou canst not use to thine
own advantage i shall be led to think that for
all thou best covered with the lion's hide nature
has left on thee the long ears the ass
amen father said the armourer a
hearty good night to you and god's blessing
on your rooftree and those whom it covers
you shall hear the smith's call sound by cockcrowing
i warrant i put sir chanticleer to
shame
so saying he took his leave and though
completely undaunted moved through the deserted
streets like one upon his guard to his
own dwelling which was situated in the mill
wynd at the western perth
chapter 
the sturdy armourer was not it may be
believed slack in keeping the appointment assigned
by his intended fatherinlaw he went
through the process his toilette with more
than ordinary care throwing as far as he could
those points which had a military air into the
shade he was far too noted a person to venture
to go entirely unarmed in a town where
he had indeed many friends but also from the
character many his former exploits several
deadly enemies at whose hands should they
take him at advantage he knew he had little
mercy to expect he therefore wore under
his jerkin a secret or coat chainmail made
so light and flexible that it interfered as little
with his movements as a modern underwaistcoat
yet such proof as he might safely depend
upon every ring it having been wrought
and joined by his own hands above this he
wore like others his age and degree the
flemish hose and doublet which in honour 
the holy tide were the best superfine english
broad cloth light blue in colour slashed outwith
black satin and passamented laced that
is with embroidery black silk his walking
boots were cordovan leather his cloak 
good scottish grey which served to conceal a
whinger or couteau de chasse that hung at his
belt and was his only offensive weapon for he
carried in his hand but a rod holly his
black velvet bonnet was lined with steel quilted
between the metal and his head and thus
constituted a means defence which might
safely be trusted to
upon the whole henry had the appearance
to which he was well entitled a burgher
 wealth and consideration assuming in
his dress as much consequence as he could
display without stepping beyond his own rank
and encroaching on that the gentry neither
did his frank and manly deportment though
indicating a total indifference to danger bear the
least resemblance to that the bravoes or swashbucklers
 the dav amongst whom henry was
sometimes unjustly ranked by those who imputed
the frays in which he was so often engaged
to a quarrelsome and violent temper resting
upon a consciousness his personal strength
and knowledge his weapon on the contrary
every feature bore the easy and goodhumoured
expression one who neither thought
 inflicting mischief nor dreaded it from others
baying attired himself in his best the honest
armourer next placed nearest to his heart
which throbbed at its touch j a little gift
which he had long provided for catharine
glover and which his quality valentine
would presently give him the title to present
and her to receive without regard to maidenly
scruples it was a small ruby cut into the
form a heart transfixed with a golden arrow
and was inclosed in a small purse made
 links the finest work in steel as if it had
been designed for a hauberk to a king round
the verge the puree were these words 
cleave hearts
this device had cost the armourer some
thought and he was much satisfied with his composition
because it seemed to imply that his
skill could defend all hearts saving his own
he wrapped himself in his cloak and hastened
through the still silent streets determined to
appear at the window appointed a little before
dawn
with this purpose he passed up the high
street and turned down the opening where
saint john's church now stands in order to
proceed to curfew street when it occurred to
him from the appearance the sky that he
was at least an hour too early for his purpose
and that it would be better not to appear at the
place rendezvous till near the time assigned
other gallants were not unlikely to be on the
watch as well as himself about the house o the
fair maid perth and he knew his own foible
eat thane
i g
s
a souffle arising betwixt them i have the advantage
he thought by my father simon's
friendship and why should i stain my fingers
with the blood the poor creatures that are not
worthy my notice since they are so much less
fortunate than myself no no i will be wise
for once and keep at a distance from all temptation
to a broil they shall have no more time
to quarrel with me than just what it may require
for me to give the signal and for my father
simon to answer it i wonder how the old
man will contrive to bring her to the window 
i fear if she knew his purpose he would find
it difficult to carry it into execution
while these loverlike thoughts were passing
through his brain the armourer loitered in his
pace often turning his eyes eastward and eying
the firmament in which no slight shades 
grey were beginning to flicker to announce
the approach dawn however distant which
to the impatience the stout armourer seemed
on that morning to abstain longer than
usual from occupying her eastern barbican he
was now passing slowly under the wall saint
anne's chapel not failing to cross himself and
say an are as he trode the consecrated ground
when a voice which seemed to come from behind
one the flying buttresses the chapel
said he lingers that has need to run
who speaks said the armourer looking
around him somewhat startled at an address so
unexpected both in its tone and tenor
u no matter who speaks answered the same
voice do thou make great speed or thou
wilt scarce make good speed bandy not words
but begone
saint or sinner angel or devil said henry
crossing himself your advice touches me
but too dearly to be neglected saint valentine
be my speed 
so saying he instantly changed his loitering
pace to one with which few people could have
kept up and in an instant was in couvrefew
street he had not made three steps towards
simon glover's which stood in the midst 
the narrow street when two men started from
under the houses on different sides and advanced
as it were by concert to intercept his passage
the imperfect light only permitted him to
discern that they wore the highland mantle
clear the way cathedral said the armourer
in the deep stern voice which corresponded
with the breadth his chest
they did not answer at least intelligibly
but he could see that they drew their swords
with the purpose withstanding him by violence
conjecturing some evil but what
kind he could not anticipate henry instantly
determined to make his way through whatever
odds and defend his mistress or at least
die at her feet he cast his cloak over his
left arm as a buckler and advanced rapidly and
steadily to the two men the nearest made a thrust
at him but henry smith parrying the blow with
his cloak dashed his arm in the man's face and
tripping him at the same time gave him a severe
fall on the causeway while almost at the same
instant he struck a blow with his linger at the
fellow who was upon his right hand so severely
applied that he also lay prostrate by his associate
meanwhile the armourer pushed forward
in alarm for which the circumstances 
the street being guarded or defended by strangers
who conducted themselves with such violence
afforded sufficient reason he heard a suppressed
whisper and a bustle under the glover's
windows those very windows from which he
had expected to be hailed by catharine as her
valentine he kept to the opposite side the
street that he might reconnoitre their number
and purpose but one the party who were
beneath the window observing or hearing him
crossed the street also and taking him doubtless
for one the sentinels asked in a whisper
 what noise was yonder kenneth why
gave you not the signal 
villain said henry you are discovered
and you shall die the death 
as he spoke thus he dealt the stranger a
blow with his weapon which would probably
have made his words good had not the man
raising his arm received on his hand the blow
meant for his head the wound must have been
a severe one for he staggered and fell with a
deep groan without noticing him farther henry
smith sprung forward upon a party men
who seemed engaged in placing a ladder against
the lattice window in the gable henry did not
stop either to count their numbers or to ascertain
their purpose but crying the alarmword
 the town and giving the signal at which the
burghers were wont to collect he rushed on the
night walkers one whom was in the act 
ascending the ladder the smith seized it by
the rounds threw it down on the pavement and
placing his foot on the body the man who had
been mounting prevented him from regaining
his feet his accomplices struck fiercely at
henry to extricate their companion but his
mailcoat stood him in good stead and he repaid
their blows with interest shouting aloud
help help for bonnie st johnston bows
and blades brave citizens bows and blades 
they break into our houses under cloud 
night
these words which resounded far through
the streets were accompanied by as many fierce
blows dealt with good effect among those whom
the armourer assailed in the meantime the
inhabitants the street began to awaken and
appear on the street iu their shirts with swords
and targets and some them with torches
the assailants now endeavoured to make their
escape which all them effected excepting the
man who had been thrown down along with the
ladder him the intrepid armourer had caught
by the throat in the scuffle and held as fast
as the greyhound holds the hare the other
wounded men were borne ois by their comrades

here are a sort knaves breaking peace
within burgh said henry to the neighbours
who began to assemble make after the rogues
they cannot all get off for i have maimed some
 them the blood will guide you to them
some highland catherine said the citizens
 up and chase neighbours 
ay chase chase leave me to manage
this fellow continued the armourer
the assistants dispersed in different directions
their lights flashing and their cries resounding
through the whole adjacent district
in the meantime the armourer's captive entreated
for freedom using both promises and
throats to obtain it as thou art a gentleman
he said let me go and what is past
shall be forgiven
i am no gentleman said henry i am
hal the wynd a burgess perth and i
have done nothing to need forgiveness
villain thou hast done thou knowest not
what but let me go and i will fill thy bonnet
with gold pieces
i shall fill thy bonnet with a cloven head
presently said the armourer unless thou
stand still as a true prisoner
what is the matter my son harry said
simon who now appeared at the window i
hear thy voice in another tone than i expected 
what is all this noise and why are the neighbours
gathering to the affray 
there have been a proper set glimmers
about to scale your windows father simon 
but i am like to prove godfather to one them
whom i hold here as fast as ever vice held
iron
hear me simon glover said the prisoner
 let me but speak one word with you iu
private and rescue me from the gripe this
ironfisted and leadenpated clown and i will
show thee that no harm was designed to thee
or thine and moreover tell thee what will
much advantage thee
i should know that voice said simon
glover who now came to the door with a darklantern
in his hand son smith let this
young man speak with me there is no danger
in him i promise you stay hut an instant
where you are and let no one enter the house
either to attack or defend i will be answerable
that this galliard meant but some saint
valentine's jest
so saying the old man pulled in the prisoner
and shut the door leaving henry a little surprised
at the unexpected light in which his 
had viewed the affray a jest 
he said it might have been a strange jest
if they had got into the maiden's sleeping
room and they would have done so had it
not been for the honest friendly voice from betwixt
the buttresses which if it were not that 
the blessed saint though what am i that the
holy person should speak to me could not
sound in that place without her permission and
assent and for which i will promise her a wax
candle at her shrine as long as my linger 
and i would i had had my twohanded broadsword
in stead both for the sake st johnston
and the rogues for a certain those lingers
are pretty toys but more fit for a boy's hand
than a man's oh my old twohanded trojan
hadst thou been in my hands as thou hengist
presently at the tester my bed the legs 
those rogues had not carried their bodies so clean
off the field but there come lighted torches
and drawn swords so ho stand are you
for st johnston if friends to the bonnie
burgh you are well come
we have been but bootless hunters said
the townsmen we followed by the tracks 
the blood into the dominican burialground
and we started two fellows from amongst the
tombs supporting betwixt them a third who
had probably got some your marks about him
harry they got to the postern gate before we
could overtake them and rang the sanctuary
bell the gate opened and in went they so
they are safe in girth and sanctuary and we
may go to our cold beds and warm us
ay said one the party the good
dominicans have always some devout brother
 their convent sitting up to open the gate 
the sanctuary to any poor soul that is in trouble
and desires shelter in the church
yes if the poor hunted soul can pay for it
said another but truly if he be poor in purse
as well as in spirit he may stand on the outside
till the hounds come up with him
a third who had been poring for a few minutes
upon the ground by advantage his torch
now looked upwards and spoke he was a
brisk forward rather corpulent little man called
oliver proudfute reasonably wealthy and
a leading man in his craft which was that 
bonnetmakers he therefore spoke as one in
authority canst tell us jolly smith for
they recognised each other by the lights which
were brought into the streets what manner
 fellows they were who raised up this fray
within burgh 
the two that i first saw answered the
armourer seemed to me as well as i could
observe them to have highland plaids about
them
like enough like enough answered the
citizen shaking his head it's a shame the
breaches in our walls are not repaired and that
these landlouping highland scoundrels are left
at liberty to take honest men and women out 
their beds any night that is dark enough
but look here neighbours said oliver
proudfute showing a bloody hand which he
had picked up from the ground when did such
a hand as this tie a highlands's brogues it
is large indeed and bony but as fine as a
lady's with a ring that sparkles like a gleaming
candle simon glover has made gloves for
this hand before now if i am not much mistaken
for he works for all the courtiers the
spectators here began to gaze on the bloody token
with various comments
if that is the case said one harry smith
had best show a clean pair heels for it
since the justiciar will scarce think the protecting
a burgess's bouse an excuse for cutting
off a gentleman's band there be hard laws
against mutilation
fie upon you that you will say so michael
webster answered the bonnetmaker are
we not representatives and successors the
stout old romans who built perth as like to their
own city as they could and have we not charters
from all our noble kings and progenitors
as being their loving liegemen and would you
have us now yield up our rights privileges and
immunities our outran and infant our handhabet
our backbearing and our bloodsuits
and amerciaments escheats and commodities
and suffer an honest burgess's house to be assaulted
without seeking for redress no brave
citizens craftsmen and burgesses the tay shall
flow back to ducked before we submit to such
injustice 
and how can we help it said a grave old
man who stood leaning on a twohanded sword 
what would you have us do 
marry bailie craigdallie i wonder that
you all men ask the question i would have
you pass like true men from this very place to
the king's grace's presence raise him from his
royal rest and presenting to him the piteous
case our being called forth from our beds at
this season with little better covering than these
shirts i would show him this bloody token and
know from his grace's own royal lips whether
it is just and honest that his loving lieges should
be thus treated by the knights and nobles his
deposed court and this i call pushing our
cause warmly
warmly sayst thou replied the old burgess
 why so warmly that we shall all die 
cold man before the porter turn a key to let
us into the royal presence come friends the
night is bitter we have kept our watch and
ward like men and our jolly smith hath given a
warning to those that would wrong us which
shall be worth twenty proclamations the
king tomorrow is a new day we will consult
on this matter on this selfsame spot and
consider what measures should be taken for
discovery and pursuit the villains and therefore
let us dismiss before the heart'sblood freeze
ill
bravo bravo neighbour craigdallie st
johnston for ever v
oliver proudfute would still have spoken for
he was one those pitiless orators who think
that their eloquence can overcome all inconveniences
in time place and circumstances but
no one would listen and the citizens dispersed
to their own houses by the light the dawn
which began now to streak the horizon
they were scarce gone ere the door glover's
house opened and seizing the smith by the
hand the old man pulled him in
where is the prisoner demanded the armourer

he is gone escaped fled what do i
know him said the glover he got out
at the back door and so through the little garden
 think not him but come and see the
valentine whose honour and life you have saved
this morning
let me but sheathe my weapon said the
smith let me but wash my hands
there is not an instant to lose she is up
and almost dressed come on man she shall
see thee with thy good weapon in thy hand and
with villain's blood on thy fingers that she may
know what is the value a true man's service
she has stopped my mouth over long with her
pruderies and her scruples i will have her
know what a brave man's love is worth and a
bold burgess's to boot
chapter 
startled from her repose by the noise 
the affray the fair maid perth had listened
in breathless terror to the sounds violence
and outcry which arose from the street she
had sunk on her knees to pray for assistance
and when she distinguished the voices neighbours
and friends collected for her protection
she remained in the same posture to return
thanks she was still kneeling when her father
almost thrust her champion henry smith
into her apartment the bashful lover hanging
back at first as if afraid to give offence
and on observing her posture from respect to
her devotion
father said the armourer she prays 
vol i k
i dare no more speak to her than to a bishop
when he says mass
now go thy ways for a right valiant and
courageous blockhead said her father and
then speaking to his daughter he added 
heaven is best thanked my daughter by
gratitude shown to our fellowcreatures here
comes the instrument by whom god has rescued
thee from death or perhaps from dishonour
worse than death receive him catharine as
thy true valentine and him whom i desire to
see my affectionate son
not thus father replied catharine i
can see can speak to no one now i am not
ungrateful perhaps i am too thankful to the
instrument our safety but let me thank the
guardian saint who sent me this timely relief
and give me but a moment to don my kirtle
nay godmercy wench it were hard
to deny thee time to busk thy bodyclothes since
the request is the only words like a woman that
thou hast uttered for these ten days truly
son harry i would my daughter would put off
being entirely a saint till the time comes for
her being canonized for st catharine the second

nay jest not father for i will swear she
has at least one sincere adorer already who
hath devoted himself to her pleasure so far as
sinful man may faretheewell then for the
moment fair maiden he concluded raising
his voice u and heaven send thee dreams as
peaceful as thy waking thoughts i go to watch
thy slumbers and woe with him that shall intrude
on them 
nay good and brave henry whose warm
heart is at such variance with thy reckless hand
thrust thyself into no farther quarrels tonight 
but take the kindest thanks and with these
try to assume the peaceful thoughts which you
assign to me tomorrow we will meet that
i may assure you my gratitude farewell
and farewell lady and light my heart 
said the armourer and descending the stair
which led to catharine's apartment was about
to sally forth into the street when the glover
caught him by the arm
i shall like the ruffle tonight said he
better than i ever thought to do the clashing
 steel if it brings my daughter to her senses
harry and teaches her what thou art worth
by st macgrider i even love these restorers
and am sorry for that poor lover who will never
wear lefthanded chevron again ay he
has lost that which he will miss all the days 
his life especially when he goes to pull on his
gloves ay he will pay but half a fee to my
craft in future nay not a step from this
house tonight he continued h thou dost
not leave us i promise thee my son
i do not mean it but i will with your
permission watch in the street the attack
may be renewed
and if it be said simon thou wilt have
better access to drive them back having the
vantage the house it is the way fighting
which suits us burghers best that resisting
from behind stone walls our duty watch
and ward teaches us that trick besides enough
are awake and astir to ensure us peace and quiet
till morning so come in this way
so saying he drew henry nothing loath
into the same apartment where they had supped
and where the old woman who was on foot
disturbed as others had been by the nocturnal
affray soon roused up the fire
and now my doughty son said the glover
 what liquor wilt thou pledge thy father
in
henry smith had suffered himself to sink
mechanically upon a seat old black oak and
now gazed on the fire that flashed back a ruddy
light over his manly features he muttered to
himself half audibly good henry brave
henry ah had she but said dear henry 
what liquors be these said the old glover
laughing my cellar holds none such 
but if sack or rhenish or wine gascony
can serve why say the word and the flagon
foams that is all
the kindest thanks said the armourer
still musing that's more than she ever said
to me before the kindest thanks what may
not that stretch to 
it shall stretch like kid's leather man
said the glover if thou wilt but be ruled
and say what thou wilt take for thy morning's
draught
whatever thou wilt father answered the
armourer carelessly and relapsed into the analysis
 catharine's speech to him she spoke
 my warm heart but she also spoke my
reckless hand what earthly thing can i do
to get rid that fighting fancy certainly
i were best strike my right hand off and nail
it to the door a church that it may never dome
discredit more
you have chopped off hands enough for one
night said his friend setting a flagon wine
on the table why dost thou vex thyself
man she would love thee twice as well did
she not see how thou contest upon her but it
becomes serious now i am not to have the
risk my booth being broken and my house
plundered by the hellraking followers the
nobles because she is called the fair maid 
perth and please ye no she shall know i am
her father and will have that obedience to which
law and gospel give me right i will have her
thy wife henry my heart gold thy wife
my man metal and that before many weeks
are over come come here is to thy merry
bridal jolly smith
the father quaffed a large cup and filled it
to his adopted son who raised it slowly to his
head then ere it had reached his lips replaced
it suddenly on the table and shook his head
nay if thou wilt not pledge me to such a
health i know no one who will said simon
what canst thou mean thou foolish lad here
has a chance happened which in a manner places
her in thy power since from one the city
to the other all would cry fie on her if she should
say thee nay here am i her father not only
consenting to the cutting out the match but
willing to see you two as closely united together
as ever needle stitched buckskin r and with all
this on thy side fortune father and all thou
loosest like a distracted lover in a ballad more
like to pitch thyself into the tay than to woo
a lass that may be had for the asking if you
can but choose the lucky minute
ay but that lucky minute father i question
much if catharine ever has such a moment
to glance on earth and its inhabitants as might
lead her to listen to a coarse ignorant borrel
man like me i cannot tell how it is father 
elsewhere i can hold up my head like another
man but with your saintly daughter i lose heart
and courage and i cannot help thinking that it
would be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if i
could succeed in surprising her affections her
thoughts are too much fitted for heaven to be
wasted on such a one as i am
e'en as you like henry answered the
glover my daughter is not courting you anymore
than i am a fair offer is no cause feud 
only if you think that i will give into her foolish
notions a convent take it with you that
i will never listen to them i love and honour
the church he said crossing himself i pay
her rights duly and cheerfully tithes and alms
wine and wax i pay them as justly i say as
any man in perth my means doth but i cannot
afford the church my only and single ewelamb
that i have in the world her mother
was dear to me on earth and is now an angel
in heaven catharine is all i have to remind
me her i have lost and if she goes to the
cloister it shall be when these old eyes are
closed for ever and not sooner but as for
you friend gow i pray you will act according
to your own best liking i want to force no
wife on you i promise you
nay now you beat the iron twice over
said henry it is thus we always father
by your being testy with me for not doing
that thing in the world which would make
me happiest were i to have it in my power
why father i would the keenest dirk i ever
forged were sticking in my heart at this moment
if there is one single particle in it that is not
more your daughter's property than my own
but what can i do i cannot think less her
or more myself than we both deserve and
what seems to you so easy and certain is to meas
difficult as it would be to work a steel hauberk
out hards flax but here is to you
father he added in a more cheerful tone 
and here is to my fair saint and valentine
as i hope your catharine will be mine for the
season and let me not keep your old head
longer from the pillow but make interest with
your featherbed till daybreak and then you
must be my guide to your daughter's chamberdoor
and my apology for entering it to bid her
good morrow for the brightest that the sun will
awaken in the city or for miles round it 
no bad advice my son said the honest
glover but you what will you do will
you lie down beside me or take a part conachar's
bed 
neither answered harry gow i
should but prevent your rest and for me this
easychair is worth a down bed and i will sleep
like a sentinel with my graith about me
as he spoke he laid his hand on his sword
nay heaven send us no more need weapons
 good night or rather good morrow
till daypeep and the first who wakes calls up
the other
thus parted the two burghers the glover
retired to his bed and it is to be supposed to
rest the lover was not so fortunate his bodily
frame easily bore the fatigue which he had
encountered in the course the night but his
i 
mind was a different and more delicate
mould in one point view he was but the
stout burgher his period proud alike his
art in making weapons and wielding them
when made his professional jealousy personal
strength and skid in the use arms brought
him into many quarrels which had made him
generally feared and in some instances disliked
but with these qualities were united
the simple goodnature a child and at the
same time an imaginative and enthusiastic temper
which seemed little to correspond with his
labours at the forge or his combats in the field
perhaps a little the hairbrained and ardent
feeling which he had picked out old ballads
or from the metrical romances which were his
sole source information or knowledge may
have been the means pricking him on to some
 his achievements which had often a rude
strain chivalry in them at least it was certain
that his love to the fair catharine had in ita
delicacy such as might have become the squire
 low degree who was honoured if song speaks
truth with the smiles the king hungary's
daughter his sentiments towards her were certainly
as exalted as if they had been fixed upon
an actual angel which made old simon and
others who watched his conduct think that his
passion was too high and devotional to be successful
with maiden mortal mould they
were mistaken however catharine coy and
reserved as she was had a heart which could
feel and understand the nature and depth the
armourer's passion and whether she was able
to repay it or not she had as much secret pride
in the attachment the redoubted henry gowns
a lady romance may be supposed to have
in the company a tame lion who follows to
provide for and defend her it was with sentiments
 the most sincere gratitude that she
recollected as she awoke at dawn the services
 henry during the course the eventful
night and the first thought which she dwelt
upon was the means making him understand
her feelings
arising hastily from bed and half blushing
at her own purpose i have been cold to him
and perhaps unjust i will not be ungrateful
she said to herself though i cannot yield to
his suit i will not wait till my father compels
me to receive him as my valentine for the year 
i will seek him out and choose him myself i
have thought other girls bold when they did
something like this but i shall thus best please
my father and but discharge the rites due to
good saint valentine by showing my gratitude
to this brave man
hastily slipping on her dress which nevertheless
was left a good deal more disordered
than usual she tripped down stairs and opened
the door the chamber in which as she had
guessed her lover had passed the hours after
the fray catharine paused at the door and
became half afraid executing her purpose
which not only permitted but enjoined the valentines
 the year to begin their connexion
with a kiss affection it was looked upon asa
peculiarly propitious omen if the one party
could find the other asleep and awaken him or
her by performance this interesting ceremony

never was a fairer opportunity offered for
commencing this mystic tic than that which
now presented itself to catharine after many
and various thoughts sleep had at length overcome
the stout armourer in the chair in which
he had deposited himself his features in repose
had a more firm and manly cast than catharine
had thought who having generally seen
them fluctuating between shamefacedness and
apprehension her displeasure had been used
to connect with them some idea imbecility
he looks very stern she said if he
should be angry and then when he awakes 
we are alone if i should call dorothy if i
should wake my father but no it is a thing
 custom and done in all maidenly and sisterly
love and honour i will not suppose that henry
can misconstrue it and i will not let a childish
fear put my gratitude to sleep
so saying she tripped along the floor the
apartment with a light though hesitating step
and a cheek crimsoned at her own purpose and
gliding to the chair the sleeper dropped a
kiss upon his lips as light as if a roseleaf had
fallen on them the slumbers must have been
slight which such a touch could dispel and
the dreams the sleeper must needs have been
connected with the cause the interruption
since henry instantly starting up caught the
maiden in his arms and attempted to return
in ecstasy the salute which had broken his repose
but catharine struggled in his embrace 
and as her efforts implied alarmed modesty
rather than maidenly coyness her bashful lover
suffered her to escape a grasp from which
twenty times her strength could not have extricated
her
nay be not angry good henry said catharine
in the kindest tone to her surprised
lover i have paid my vows to saint valentine
to show how i value the mate which he
has sent me for the year let but my father
be present and i will not dare to refuse thee
the revenge you may claim for a broken sleep
let not that be a hinderance said the old
glover rushing in ecstasy into the room to
her smith to her strike while the iron is
hot and teach her what it is not to let sleeping
dogs lie still
thus encouraged henry though perhaps
with less alarming vivacity again seized the
blushing maiden in his arms who submitted
with a tolerable grace to receive repayment 
her salute a dozen times repeated and with an
energy very different from that which had provoked
such severe retaliation at length she
again extricated herself from her lover's arms
and as if frightened and repenting what she
had done threw herself into a seat and covered
her face with her hands
cheer up thou silly girl said her father
and be not ashamed that thou hast made the
two happiest men in perth since thy old father
is one them never was kiss so well bestowed
and meet it is that it should be suitably returned
look up my darling look up and let
me see thee but give one smile by my honest
word the sun that now rises over our fair city
shows no sight that can give me greater pleasure
 what he continued in a jocose tone
thou though st thou hadst jamie eddie's
ring and couldst walk invisible but not so my
fairy the dawning just as i was about to
rise i heard tby chamber door open and watched
thee down stairs not to protect thee against
this sleepyheaded henry but to see with my
own delighted eyes my beloved girl do that
which her father most wished come put
down these foolish hands and though thou
blushes a little it will only the better grace
st valentine's morn when blushes best become
a maiden's cheek
as simon glover spoke he pulled away
with gentle violence the hands which hid his
daughter's face she blushed deeply indeed
but there was more than maiden's shame in her
face and her eyes were fast filling with tears
what weeping love continued her father
 nay nay this is more than need 
henry help me to comfort this little fool
catharine made an effort to collect herself
and to smile but the smile was a melancholy
and serious cast
i only meant to say father said the fair
maid perth with continued exertion that
in choosing henry gow for my valentine and
rendering to him the rights and greeting the
vol i i
morning according to wonted custom i meant
bat to show my gratitude to him for his manly
and faithful service and my obedience to
you but do not lead him to think and oh
dearest father do not yourself entertain an idea
that i meant more than what the promise to be
his faithful and affectionate valentine through
the year requires me
ay ay ay ay we understand it all
said simon in the soothing tone which nurses
apply to children we understand what the
meaning is enough for once enough for once
thou shalt not be frightened or hurried loving
true and faithful valentines are ye and
the rest as heaven and opportunity shall permit
come prithee have donewring not
thy tiny hands nor fear farther persecution
now thou hast done bravely excellently 
and now away to dorothy and call up the old
sluggard we must have a substantial breakfast
after a night confusion and a morning
 joy and thy hand will be needed to prepare
for us some these delicate cakes which no
one can make but thyself and well hast thou
a right to the secret seeing who taught it thee
ah health to the soul thy dearest mother
he added with a sigh how blithe would she
have been to see this happy st valentine's
morning 
catharine took the opportunity escape
which was thus given her and glided from the
room to henry it seemed as if the sun had
disappeared from the heaven at midday and left
the world in sudden obscurity even the highswelled
hopes with which the late incident had
filled him began to quail as he reflected upon
her altered demeanour the tears in her eyes 
the obvious fear which occupied her features 
and the pains she had taken to show as plainly
as delicacy would permit that the advances
which she had made to him were limited to the
character with which the rites the day had
invested him her father looked on his fallen
countenance with something like surprise and
displeasure
in the name good st john what has befallen
you that makes you look as grave as an
owl when a lad your spirit having really
such a fancy for this poor girl as you pretend
ought to be as lively as a lark 
alas father replied the crestfallen lover
 there is that written on her brow which
says she loves me well enough to be my valentine
especially since you wish it but not well
enough to be my wife
now a plague on thee for a cold downhearted
goosecap answered the father i
can read a woman's brow as well and better
than thou and i can see no such matter on
hers what the foul fiend man there thou
wast lying like a lord in thy elbowchair as
sound asleep as a judge when hadst thou been
a lover any spirit thou wouldst have been
watching the east for the first ray the sun
but there thou latest snoring i warrant thinking
nought about her or anything else and
the poor girl rises at peep day lest any one
else should pick up her most precious and vigilant
valentine and wakes thee with a grace
which so help me st macgrider would
have put life in an anvil and thou awakes
to hone and pine and moan as if she had
lj
drawn a hot iron across thy lips i would to
st john she had sent old dorothy on the errand
and bound thee for thy valentine service
to that bundle dry bones with never a tooth
in her head she were fittest valentine in
perth for so craven a wooer
as to craven father answered the smith
there are twenty good cocks whose combs i
have plucked can tell thee if i am craven or no
and heaven knows that i would give my good
land held by burgess tenure with smithy bellows
tongs anvil and all providing it would
make your view the matter the true one but
it is not her coyness or her blushes that i
speak it is the paleness which so soon followed
the red and chased it from her cheeks 
and it is the tears which succeeded it was
like the april shower stealing upon and obscuring
the fairest dawning that ever beamed
over the tay
tutti tahiti replied the glover neither
rome nor perth were built in a day thou hast
fished salmon a thousand times and nights
have taken a lesson when the fish has taken
the fly to pull a hard strain on the line would
snap the tackle to pieces were it made wire
ease your hand man and let him rise take
leisure and in halfanhour thou layesthim on
the bank there is a beginning as fair as you
could wish unless you expect the poor wench
to come to thy bedside as she did to thy chair 
and that is not the fashion modest maidens
but observe me after we have had our breakfast
i will take care thou hast an opportunity
to speak thy mind only beware thou be neither
too backward nor press her too hard give
her line enough but do not slack too fast and
my life for yours upon the issue
do what i can father answered henry
you will always lay the blame on me either
that i give too much head or that i strain the
tackle i would give the best habergeon i ever
wrought that the difficulty in truth rested with
me for there were then the better chance its
being removed i own however i am but an
ass in the trick bringing about such discourse
as is to the purpose for the occasion
come into the booth with me my son and
i will furnish thee with a fitting theme thou
knowest the maiden who ventures to kiss a
sleeping man wins him a pair gloves
come to my booth thou shalt have a pair 
delicate kidskin that will exactly suit her hand
and arm i was thinking her poor mother
when i shaped them added honest simon with
a sigh and except catharine i know not
the woman in scotland whom they would fit
though i have measured most the high beauties
 the court come with me i say and
thou shalt be provided with a theme to wag thy
tongue upon providing thou have courage and
caution to stand by thee in thy wooing
chapter v
never to man shall catharine give her hand
taming a shrew
the breakfast was served and the thin soft
cakes made flour and honey according to
the family receipt were not only commended
with all the partiality a father and a lover
but done liberal justice to in the mode which
is best proof cake as well as pudding they
talked jested and laughed catharine too
had recovered her equanimity where the dames
and damsels the period were apt to lose theirs
in the kitchen namely and in the superintendence
 household affairs in which she was an
adept i question much if the perusal seneca
for as long a period would have had equal
effect in composing her mind
old dorothy sate down at the boardend as
was the homespun fashion the period and
so much were the two men amused with their
own conversation and catharine occupied
either in attending to them or with her own reflections
 that the old woman was the first
who observed the absence the boy conachar
it is true said the master glover go
call him the idle highland loon he was not
seen last night during the fray neither at least
i saw him not did any you observe him 
the reply was negative and henry's observation
followed 
there are times when highlanders can
couch like their own deer ay and run from
danger too as fast i have seen them do so
myself for the matter that
 and there are times replied simon
when king arthur and his round table could
not make stand against them i wish henry you
would speak more reverently the highlanders
they are often in perth both alone and in
numbers and you ought to keep peace with
them so long as they will keep peace with you
an answer defiance rose to henry's lips
but be prudently suppressed it
why thou knowest father he said smiling
 that we handicrafts best love the folks
we live by now my craft provides for valiant
and noble knights gentle squires and pages
stout menatarms and others that wear the
arms which we make it is natural i should
like the ruthless the lindsay the ogilvys
the oliphant and so many others our brave
and noble neighbours who are sheathed in
steel my making like so many paladins
better than those naked snatching mountaineers
who are ever doing us wrong especially
since no five each clan have a rusty shirt
 mail as old as their br attach and that is but
the work the clumsy clansmith after all
who is no member our honourable mystery
but simply works at the anvil where his father
wrought before him i say such people can
have no favour in the eyes an honest craftsman

well well answered simon i prithee
 standard
let the matter rest even now for here comes
the loitering boy and though it is a holiday
morn i want no more bloody puddings
the youth entered accordingly his face was
pale his eyes red and there was an air discomposure
about his whole person he sate
down at the lower the table opposite to
dorothy and crossed himself as if preparing
for his morning's meal as he did not help
himself to any food catharine offered him a
platter containing some the cakes which had
met with such general approbation at first
he rejected her offered kindness rather sullenly 
but on her repeating the offer with a smile 
good will he took a cake in his hand broke it
and was about to eat a morsel when the effort
to swallow seemed almost too much for him 
and though he succeeded he did not repeat it
you have a bad appetite for saint valentine's
morning conachar said his goodhumoured
master and yet i think you must
have slept soundly the night before since i conclude
you were not disturbed by the noise 
the scuffle why i thought a lively glunami
would have been at his master's side dirk in
hand at the first sound danger which arose
within a mile us
i heard but an indistinct noise said the
youth his face glowing suddenly like a heated
coal which i took for the shout some
merry revellers and you are wont to bid me
never open door or window or alarm the house
on the score such folly
well well said simon i thought a
highlander would have known better the difference
betwixt the clash swords and the
twanging on harps the wild warcry and the
merry hunts up but let it pass boy i am
glad thou art losing thy quarrelsome fashions
eat thy breakfast any way as i have that to
employ thee which requires haste
i have breakfasted already and am in haste
myself i am for the hills have you any message
to my father 
none replied the glover in some surprise
but art thou beside thyself boy or what
a vengeance takes thee from the city like the
wing the whirlwind
my warning has been sudden said concha
speaking with difficulty but whether arising
from the hesitation incidental to the use 
a foreign language or whether from some other
cause could not easily be distinguished there
is to be a meeting a great hunting here
he stopped
and when are you to return from this
blessed hunting said his master that is
if i may make so bold as to ask
i cannot exactly answer replied the apprentice
 perhaps never if such be my father's
pleasure continued conachar with assumed
indifference
i thought said simon glover rather seriously
 that all this was to be laid aside
when at earnest intercession i took you under
my roof i thought that when i undertook being
very loath to do so to teach you an honest
trade we were to hear no more hunting or
hosting or clangatherings or any matters 
the kind
i was not consulted when i was sent hither
said the lad haughtily i cannot tell
what the terms were
but i can tell you sir conachar said
the glover angrily that there is no fashion
u
 honesty in binding yourself to an honest
craftsman and spoiling more hides than your
own is worth and now when you are age
to be some service in taking up the disposal
 your time at your pleasure as if it were your
own property not your masters
reckon with my father about that answered
conachar he will pay you gallantly 
a french mutton for every hide i have spoiled
and a fat cow or bullock for each day i have
been absent
close with him friend glover close with
him said the armourer drily l thou wiltbe paid
gallantly at least if not honestly methinks i
would like to know how many purses have been
emptied to fill the goatskin sporranf that is to
be so free to you its gold and whose pastures
mouton a french gold coin so called from its being impressed
with the image a lamb
f the highland pouch generally formed goatskin and
worn in front the garb is called in gaelic a sporran a
sporranmouuach is a shaggy pouch formed as they usually
are goatskin or some such material with the rough side
outermost
the bullocks have been calved in that are to be
sent down to you from the grampian passes
you remind me friend said the highland
youth turning haughtily towards the
smith that i have also a reckoning to hold
with you
keep at arm'slength then said henry
extending his brawny arm i will have no
more close hugs no more bodkin work like
last night i care little for a wasp's sting yet
i will not allow the insect to come near me if i
have warning
conachar smiled contemptuously i meant
thee no harm he said my father's son did
thee but too much honour to spill such churl's
blood i will pay you for it by the drop that it
may be dried up and no longer soil my fingers
peace thou bragging ape said the smith 
the blood a true man cannot be valued in
gold the only expiation would be that thou
shouldst come a mile into the low country
with two the strongest galloglasses thy
clan and while i dealt with them i would leave
thee to the correction my apprentice little
nankin
here catharine interposed peace she
said my trusty valentine whom i have a right
to command and peace you conachar who
ought to obey me as your master's daughter
it is ill done to awaken again on the morrow
the evil which has been laid to sleep at night
farewell then master said conachar after
another look scorn at the smith which he
only answered with a laugh farewell and i
thank you for your kindness which has been
more than i deserved if i have at times seemed
less than thankful it was the fault circumstances
and not my will catharine he
cast upon the maiden a look strong emotion
in which various feelings were blended he hesitated
as if to say something and at length
turned away with the single woidfarewell five
minutes afterwards with highland buskins on
his feet and a small bundle in his hand he
passed through the north gate perth and directed
his course to the highlands
there goes enough beggary and pride
for a whole highland clan said henry he
talks as familiarly gold pieces as i would 
silver pennies and yet i will be sworn that the
thumb his mother's worsted glove might hold
the treasure the whole clan
like enough said the glover laughing at
the idea his mother was a largeboned woman
especially in the fingers and wrist
and as for cattle continued henry i
reckon his father and brothers steal sheep by
one at a time
the less we say them the better said
the glover becoming again grave rt brothers
he hath none his father is a powerful man 
hath long hands reaches as far as he can and
hears farther than it is necessary to talk 
him
and yet he hath bound his only son apprentice
to a glover in perth said henry
why i should have thought the gentle craft
as it is called st crispin would have suited
him best and that if the son some great mac
or o was to become an artizan it could only be
in the craft where princes set him the example
this remark though ironical seemed to away
i k
ken our friend simon's sense professional
dignity which was a prevailing feeling that
marked the manners the artizans the time
you err son henry he replied with much
gravity the glovers are the more honourable
craft the two in regard they provide
for the accommodation the hands whereas
the shoemakers and cordwainers do but work
for the feet
both equally necessary members the
body corporate said henry whose father had
been a cordwainer
it may be so my son said the glover 
but not both alike honourable bethink you
that we employ the hands as pledges friendship
and good faith and the feet have no such privilege
brave men fight with their hands 
cowards employ their feet in flight a glove
is borne aloft a shoe is trampled in the mire 
a man greets a friend with his open hand
he spurns a dog or one whom he holds as mean
as a dog with his advanced foot a glove on
the point a spear is a sign and pledge 
faith all the wide world over as a gauntlet

flung down is a gage knightly battle while
i know no other emblem belonging to an old
shoe except that some crones will fling them
after a man by way good luck in which
practice i avow myself to entertain no confidence

m nay said the smith amused with his
friend's eloquent pleading for the dignity the
art he practised i am not the man i promise
you to disparage the glover's mystery bethink
you i am myself a maker gauntlets
but the dignity your ancient craft removes
not my wonder that the father this concha
suffered his son to learn a trade any
kind from a lowland craftsman holding us
as they do altogether beneath their magnificent
degree and a race contemptible drudges unworthy
 any other fate than to be ill used
and plundered as often as these barebreeches
dunniewassals see safety and convenience for
doing so
ay answered the glover but there
were powerful reasons for for he
withheld something which seemed upon his
lips and went on for conaclmr's father acting
as he did well i have played fair with
him and i do not doubt but he will act honourably
by me butconachar's sudden leavetaking
has put me to some inconvenience he
had things under his charge i must look
through the booth
can i help you father said henry undeceived
by the earnestness his manner
you no said simon with a dryness
which made henry so sensible the simplicity
 his proposal that he blushed to the eyes at
his own dulness comprehension in a matter
where love ought to have induced him to take
his cue easily up you catharine said the
glover as he left the room entertain your
valentine for five minutes and see he departs
not till my return come hither with me old
dorothy and bestir thy limbs in my behalf
he left the room followed by the old woman 
and henry smith remained with catharine almost
for the first time in his life entirely alone
there was embarrassment on the maiden's part
and awkwardness on that the lover for about
ua
minute when henry calling up his courage
pulled the gloves put his pocket with which
simon had supplied him and asked her to permit
one who had been so highly graced that
morning to pay the usual penalty for being
asleep at the moment when he would have
given the slumbers a whole twelvemonth to
be awake for a single minute
nay but said catharine the fulfilment
 my homage to st valentine infers no such
penalty as you desire to pay and i cannot
therefore think accepting them
these gloves said henry advancing his
seat insidiously towards catharine as he spoke
were wrought by the hands that are dearest
to you and see they are shaped for your
own he extended them as he spoke and taking
her arm in his robust hand spread the gloves
beside it to show how well they fitted look
at that taper arm he said look at these
small fingers think who sewed these seams 
silk and gold and think whether the glove
and the arm which alone the glove can fit ought
to remain separate because the poor glove has
had the misfortune to be for a passing minute
in the keeping a hand so swart and rough as
mine
they are welcome as coming from my father
said catharine and surely not less so
as coming from my friend and there was an
emphasis on the word as well as my valentine
and preserver
let me aid to do them on said the smith
bringing himself yet closer to her side they
may seem a little over tight at first and you
may require some assistance
you are skilful in such service good henry
gow said the maiden smiling but at the
same time drawing farther from her lover
in good faith no said henry shaking his
head my experience has been in donning
steel gauntlets on mailed knights more than in
fitting embroidered gloves upon maidens
i will trouble you then no further and
dorothy shall aid me though there needs no assistance
 my father's eye and fingers are faithful
to his craft what work he puts through his
hands is always true to the measure
let me be convinced it said the smith 
let me see that these slender gloves actually
match the hands they were made for
some other time good henry answered
the maiden i will wear the gloves in honour
 st valentine and the mate he has sent me for
the season i would to heaven i could pleasure
my father as well in weightier matters at present
the perfume the leather harms the headach
i have had since morning
headeach dearest maiden echoed her
lover
if you call it heartach you will not misname
it said catharine with a sigh and proceeded
to speak in a very serious tone henry
she said i am going perhaps to be as
bold as i gave you reason to think me this
morning for i am about to speak the first upon
a subject on which it may well be i ought to
wait till i had to answer you but i cannot
after what has happened this morning suffer my
feelings towards you to remain unexplained
without the possibility my being greatly misconceived
 nay do not answer till you have

heard me out you are brave henry beyond
most men honest and true as the steel you
work upon 
stop stop catharine for mercy's sake 
you never said so much that was good concerning
me save to introduce some bitter censure
 which your praises were the harbingers
i am honest and so forth you would say buta
hotbrained brawler and common shorter
or stabber
i should injure both myself and you in
calling you such no henry to no common
stabber had he worn a plume in his bonnet
and gold spurs on his heels would catharine
glover have offered the little grace she has this
day voluntarily done to you if i have at times
dwelt severely upon the proneness your spirit
to anger and your hand to strife it is because
i would have you if i could so persuade
you hate in yourself the sins vanity and
wrath by which you are most easily beset i
have spoken on the topic more to alarm your
own conscience than to express my opinion i
know as well as my father that in thcbe force

lord and desperate days the whole customs 
our nation nay every christian nation maybe
quoted in favour bloody quarrels for trifling
causes the taking deadly and deep revenge
for slight offences and the slaughter 
each other for emulation honour or often in
mere sport but i know that for all these
things we shall one day be called into judgment
 and fain would i convince thee my
brave and generous friend to listen oftener to
the dictates thy good heart and take less
pride in the strength and dexterity thy unsparing
arm
i am i am convinced catharine exclaimed
henry thy words shall henceforward
be a law to me i have done enough
far too much indeed for proof my bodily
strength and courage but it is only from you
catharine that i can learn a better way 
thinking remember my fair valentine that
my ambition distinction in arms and my
love strife if it can be called such do not
fight evenhanded with my reason and my
milder dispositions but have their patrons and
sticklers to egg them on is there a quarrel 
and suppose that i thinking on your counsels
am something loth to engage in it believe
you i am left to decide between peace or war at
my own choosing not so by st mary there
are a hundred round me to stir me on why
how now smith is thy mainspring rusted says
one jolly henry is deaf on the quarrelling
ear this morning says another stand to it
for the honour perth says my lord the provost
 harry against them for a gold noble
cries your father perhaps now what can a
poor fellow do catharine when all are hallooing
him on in the devil's name and not a soul
putting in a word on the other side 
nay i know the devil has factors enough
to utter his wares said catharine but it is
our duty to despise such idle arguments though
they may be pleaded even by those to whom we
owe much love and honour
then there are the minstrels with their
romaunt and ballads which place all a man's
praise in receiving and repaying hard blows
it is sad to tell catharine how many my
sins that blind harry the minstrel hath to answer
for when i hit a downright blow it is
not so save me st john to do any man
injury but only to strike as william wallace
struck
the minstrels namesake spoke this in such
a tone rueful seriousness that catharine
could scarce forbear smiling but nevertheless
she assured him that the danger his own and
other men's lives ought not for a moment to be
weighed against such simple toys
ay but replied henry emboldened by
her smiles methinks now the good cause 
peace would thrive all the better for an advocate
suppose for example that when i am pressed
and urged to lay hand on my weapon i could
have cause to recollect that there was a gentle
and guardian angel at home whose image would
seem to whisper henry do no violence it
is my hand which you crimson with blood 
henry rush upon no idle danger it is my
breast which you expose to injury such
thoughts would do more to restrain my mood
than if every monk in perth should cry hold
thy hand on pain bell and candle 
if such a warning as could be given by the
voice sisterly affection can have weight in the
debate said catharine do think that in striking
you empurple this hand that in receiving
wounds you harm this heart
the smith took courage at the sincerely affectionate
tone in which these words were delivered

and wherefore not stretch your regard a
degree beyond these cold limits why since you
are so kind and generous as to own some interest
in the poor ignorant sinner before you
should you not at once adopt him as your scholar
and your husband your father desires it 
the town expects it glovers and smiths are
preparing their rejoicing and you only you
whose words are so fair and so kind you will
not give your consent 
henry said catharine in a low and tremulous
voice believe me i should hold it my
duty to comply with my father's commands
were there not obstacles invincible to the
match which he proposes
fcc yet think think but for a moment 
have little to say for myself in comparison 
you who can both read and write but then
i wish to hear reading and could listen to your
sweet voice for ever you love music and i
have been taught to play and sing as well as
some minstrels you love to be charitable i
have enough to give and enough to keep as
large a daily alms as a deacon gives would
never be missed by me your father gets old
for daily toil he would live with us as i should
truly hold him for my father also i would be
as chary mixing in causeless strife as 
thrusting my hand into my own furnace and
if there came on us unlawful violence its wares
would be brought to an illchosen market
may you experience all the domestic happiness
which you can conceive henry but
with some one more happy than i am
so spoke or rather so sobbed the fair maiden
 perth who seemed choking in the attempt
to restrain her tears
you hate me then said the lover after
a pause
heaven is mv witness no
or you love some other better 
it is cruel to ask what it cannot avail you
to know but you are entirely mistaken
yon wildcat conachar perhaps said
henry i have marked his looks 
you avail yourself this painful situation
to insult me henry though i have little deserved
it conachar is nothing to me more
than the trying to tame his wild spirit by instruction
might lead me to take some interest
in a mind abandoned to prejudices and passions
and therein henry not unlike your own
it must then be some these flaunting
silk worm sirs about the court said the armourer
his natural heat temper kindling
from disappointment and vexation some 
those who think they carry it off through the
height their plumed bonnets and the jingle
 their spurs i would i knew which it was
that leaving his natural mates the painted and
perfumed dames the court comes to take
his prey among the simple maidens the
burgher craft i would i knew but his name
and surname 

henry smith said catharine shaking off
the weakness which seemed to threaten to overpower
her a moment before this is the language
 an ungrateful fool or rather a frantic
madman i have told you already there
was no one who stood at the beginning this
conference more high in my opinion than he
who is now losing ground with every word he
utters in the tone unjust suspicion and senseless
anger you had no title to know even what
i have told you which i pray you to observe
implies no preference to you over others though
it disowns any preference another to you it
is enough you should be aware that there is as
insuperable an objection to what you desire as
if an enchante had a spell over my destiny
spells may be broken by true men y said
the smith i would it were come to that
thorbiorn the danish armourer spoke a
spell he had for making breastplates by singing
a certain song while the iron was heating
i told him that his runic rhymes were no proof
against the weapons which fought at loncarty
what farther came it it is needless to tell 
but the corslet and the wearer and the leech
who salved his wound know if henry gowan
break a spell or no
catharine looked at him as if about to return
an answer little approving the exploit he had
vaunted which the downright smith had not
recollected was a kind that exposed him to
her frequent censure but ere she had given
words to her thoughts her father thrust his
head in at the door
henry he said i must interrupt your
more pleasing affairs and request you to come
into my working room in all speed to consult
about certain matters deeply affecting the weal
 the burgh
henry making his obeisance to catharine
left the apartment upon her father's summons
indeed it was probably in favour their future
friendly intercourse that they were parted on
this occasion at the turn which the conversation
seemed likely to take for as the wooer
had begun to hold the refusal the damsel as
somewhat capricious and inexplicable after the
degree encouragement which in his opinion
g
she had afforded catharine on the other hand
considered him rather as an encroacher upon
the grace which she had shown him than one
whose delicacy rendered him deserving such
favour
but there was living in their bosoms towards
each other a reciprocal kindness which on the
termination the dispute was sure to revive
inducing the maiden to forget her offended delicacy
and the lover his slighted warmth 
passion

chapter 
this quarrel may draw blood another day
henry part 
the conclave citizens appointed to meet for
investigating the affray the preceding evening
had now assembled the workroom 
simon glover was filled to crowding by personages
 no little consequence some whom
wore black velvet cloaks and gold chains around
their necks they were indeed the fathers 
the city and there were bailies and deacons in
the honoured number there was an ireful
and offended air importance upon every
brow as they conversed together rather in
whisper than aloud or in detail busiest among
the busy the little important assistant the
previous night oliver proudfute by name and
bonnetmaker by profession was bustling among
the crowd much after the manner the seagull
which flutters screams and sputters most
at the commencement a gale wind though
one can hardly conceive what the bird has better
to do than to fly to its nest and remain quiet
till the gale is over
be that as it may master proudfute was in
the midst the crowd his fingers upon everyone's
button and his mouth in every man's ear
embracing such as were near to his own stature
that he might more closely and mysteriously
utter his sentiments and standing on tip
toe and supporting himself by the cloakcollars
 tall men that he might dole out to them
also the same share information he felt
himself one the heroes the affair being
conscious the dignity superior information
on the subject as an eyewitness and much disposed
to push his connexion with the scuffle a
few points beyond the modesty truth it
cannot be said his communications were in
especial curious and important consisting chiefly
 such assertions as these 
it is all true bv st john i was there
and saw it myself was the first to run to the
fray and if it had not been for me and another
stout fellow who came in about the same time
they had broken into simon glover's house
cut his throat and carried his daughter off to
the mountains it is too evil usage not to be
suffered neighbour crookshank not to be endured
neighbour glass not to be borne neighbours
balneaves pollock and christen it
was a mercy that i and that stout fellow came
in was it not neighbour and worthy bailie
craigdallie 
these speeches were dispersed by the busy
bonnetmaker into sundry ears bailie craigdallied
a portly guildbrother the same who had
advised the prorogation their civic council to
the present place and hour a big burly goodlooking
man shook the deacon from his cloak
with pretty much the grace with which a large
horse shrugs off the importunate fly that has
beset him for ten minutes and exclaimed silence
good citizens here comes simon glover
in whom no man ever saw falsehood we will
hear the outrage from his own mouth
simon being called upon to tell his tale did
so with obvious embarrassment which he imputed
to a reluctance that the burgh should be
put in deadly feud with any one upon his account
it was he dared to say a masking or
revel on the part the young gallants about
court and the worst that might come it
would be that he would put iron sanctions
on his daughter's window in case such another
frolic
why then if this was a mere masking or
mummery said craigdallie our townsman
harry the wynd did far wrong to cut off a
gentleman's hand for such a harmless pleasantry
and the town may be brought to a
heavy fine for it unless we secure the person
 the mutilator
our lady forbid said the glover did
you know what i do you would be as much
afraid handling this matter as if it were
glowing iron but since you will needs put
your fingers in the fire truth must be spoken
and come what will i must say that the
matter might have ended ill for me and mine

but for the opportune assistance henry goethe
armourer well known to you all
and mine also was not wanting said
oliver proudfute though i do not profess to
be utterly so good a swordsman as our neighbour
henry gow you saw me neighbour
glover at the beginning the fray 
i saw you after the it neighbour
answered the glover drily
true true i had forgot you were in your
house while the blows were going and could
not survey who were dealing them
peace neighbour proudfute i prithee
peace said craigdallie who was obviously
tired the tuneless screeching the worthy
deacon
there is something mysterious here said
the bailie but i think i spy the secret our
friend simon is as you all know a peaceful
man and one that will rather sit down with
wrong than put a friend or say a neighbourhood
in danger to seek his redress thou
henry who art never wanting where the
burgh needs a defender tell us what thou knowest
 this matter
our smith told his story to the same purpose
which we have already related and the meddling
maker bonnets added as before and
thou safest me there honest smith didst thou
not 
not i in good faith neighbour answered
henry but you are a little man you know
and i might overlook you
this reply produced a laugh at oliver's expense
who laughed for company but added
m i was one the foremost to the rescue for all
that
why where wert thou then neighbour 
said the smith for i saw you not and i
would have given the worth the best suit 
armour i ever wrought to have seen as stout a
fellow as thou at my elbow
i was no farther off however honest smith 
and whilst thou wert laying on blows as if on an
anvil i was parrying those that the rest the
villains aimed at thee behind thy back and that
is the cause thou safest me not
i have heard smiths old time who
had but one eye said henry i have two
but they are both set in my forehead and so i
could not see behind my back neighbour
the truth is however persevered master
oliver there i was and i will give master
bailie my account the matter for the smith
and i were first up to the fray
enough at present said the bailie waving
to master proudfute an injunction silence
the precognition simon glover and henry
gow would bear out a matter less worthy 
belief and now my masters your opinion
what should be done here are all our burgher
rights broken through and insulted and you
may well fancy that it is by some man power
since no less dared have attempted such an outrage
my masters it is hard on flesh and blood
to submit to this the laws have framed us 
lower rank than the princes and nobles yet it
is against reason to suppose that we will suffer
our houses to be broken into and the honour 
our women insulted without some redress
it is not to be endured answered the citizens
unanimously
here simon glover interfered with a very
anxious and ominous countenance i hope
still that all was not meant so ill as it seemed
to us my worthy neighbours and i for one
would cheerfully forgive the alarm and disturbance
to my poor house providing the fair city
were not brought into jeopardy for me i beseech
you to consider who are to be our judges
that are to hear the case and give or refuse redress
i speak among neighbours and friends
and therefore i speak openly the king god
bless him is so broken in mind and body that
he will but turn us over to some great man
amongst his councillors who shall be in favour
for the time perchance he will refer us to
his brother the duke albany who will make
our petition for righting our wrongs the pretence
for squeezing money out us
we will none albany for our judge
answered the meeting with the same unanimity
as before
or perhaps added simon he will bid
the duke rothsay take charge it and the
wild young prince will regard the outrage as
something for his gay companions to scoff at
and his minstrels to turn into a song
away with rothsay he is too gay to be
our judge again exclaimed the citizens
simon emboldened by seeing he was reaching
the point he aimed at yet pronouncing the
dreaded name with a half whisper next added
would you like the black douglas better to
deal with 
there was no answer for a minute they
looked on each other with fallen countenances
and blanched lips but henry smith spoke out
boldly and in a decided voice the sentiments
which all felt but none else dared give words
to
the black douglas to judge betwixt a
burgher and a gentleman nay a nobleman for
all i know or care the black devil hell
sooner you are mad father simon so much
as to name so wild a proposal
there was again a silence fear and uncertainty
which was at length broken by bailie
craigdallie who looking very significantly to
the speaker replied you are confident in a
stout doublet neighbour smith or you would
not talk so boldly
i am confident a good heart under my
doublet such as it is bailie answered the undaunted
henry and though i speak but little
my mouth shall never be padlocked by any
noble them all
wear a thick doublet good henry or do
not speak so loud reiterated the bailie in the
same significant tone there are border menin
the town who wear the bloody heart on their
shoulder but all this is no rede what shall
we do 
short rede good rede said the smith
let us to our provost and demand his countenance
and assistance
a murmur applause went through the
party and oliver proudfute exclaimed that
is what i have been saying for this half hour
and not one ye would listen to me let us
go to our provost said i he is a gentleman
himself and ought to come between the burgh
and the nobles in all matters
hush neighbours hush be wary what
you say or do said a thin meagre figure a
man whose diminutive person seemed still more
reduced in size and more assimilated to a shadow
by his efforts to assume an extreme degree
 humility and make himself to suit his argument
look meaner yet and yet more insignificant
than nature had made him
m pardon me said he i am but a poor 
nevertheless i have been bred in paris
and learned my humanities and my cursus mededi
as well as some that call themselves learned
leeches methinks i can tent this wound
and treat it with emollients here is our friend
simon glover who is as you all know a man
 worship think you he would not be the
most willing us all to pursue harsh courses
here since his family honour is so nearly concerned
 and since he blenches away from the
charge against these same revellers consider if
he may not have some good reason more than
he cares to utter for letting the matter sleep it
is not for me to put my finger on the sore but
alack we all know that young maidens are
what i call fugitive essences suppose now an
honest maiden i mean in all innocence leaves
her window unlatched on st valentine's morn
that some gallant cavalier may in all honesty
i mean become her valentine for the season 
and suppose the gallant be discovered may she
not scream out as if the visit were unexpected
and and bray all this in a mortar and then
consider will it be a matter to place the town
in feud for 
the pottingar delivered his opinion in a most
insinuating manner but he seemed to shrink
into something less than his natural tenuity
when he saw the blood rise in the old cheeks
 simon glover and inflame to the temples
the complexion the redoubled smith the
last stepping forward and turning a stern look
on the alarmed pottingar broke out as follows
 thou walking skeleton thou asthmatic
gallipot thou poisoner by profession if
i thought that the puff vile breath thou hast
left could blight for the tenth part a minute
the fair fame catharine glover i would
pound thee quacksalver in thine own mortar
and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower
 brimstone the only real medicine in thy
booth to make a salve to rub mangy hounds
with 
hold son henry hold cried the glover
in a tone authority no man has title to
speak this matter but me worshipful bailie
craigdallie since such is the construction that
is put upon my patience i am willing to pursue
this riot to the uttermost and though the
issue may prove that we had better have been
patient you will all see that my catharine hath
not by any lightness or folly hers afforded
grounds for this great scandal
the bailie also interposed u neighbour henry
said he we came here to consult and not
to quarrel as one the fathers the fair city
i command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent
you may have against master pottingar
dwining 
he is too poor a creature bailie said
henry gow for me to harbour feud with 
i that could destroy him and his booth with
one blow my forehammer
peace then and hear me said the official
 we all are as much believers in the honour 
the fair maiden perth as in that our
blessed lady here he crossed himself devoutly
 but touching our appeal to our provost
are you agreed neighbours to put matter like
this into our provost's hand being against a
powerful noble as is to be feared 
the provost being himself a nobleman 
squeaked the pottingar in some measure released
from his terror by the intervention the
bailie god knows i speak not to the disparagement
 an honourable gentleman whose
forebears have held the office he now holds for
many years 
by free choice the citizens perth
said the smith interrupting the speaker with
the tones his deep and decisive voice
ay surely said the disconcerted orator
by the voice the citizens how else i
pray you friend smith interrupt me not i
speak to our worthy and eldest bailie craigdallied
according to my poor mind i say that
come amongst us how he will still this sir patrick
charter is is a nobleman and hawks will
not pick hawks eyes out he may well bear
us out in a feud with the highlandmen and
do the part our provost and leader against
them but whether he that himself wears silk will
take our part against broidered cloak and cloth
 gold though he may do so against tartan and
irish frieze is something to be questioned take
a fool's advice we have saved our maiden 
whom i never meant to speak harm as truly i
knew none they have lost one man's hand
at least thanks to harry smith 
and to me added the little important
bonnetmaker
and to oliver proudfute as he tells us
continued the pottingar who contested no man's
claim to glory provided he was not himself
compelled to tread the perilous paths which lead
to it i say neighbours since they have left
a hand as a pledge they will never come in
couvrefew street again why in my simple mind
we were best to thank our stout townsman and
the town having the honour and these rakehells
the loss that we should hush the matter
up and say no more about it
these pacific counsels had their effect with
some the citizens who began to nod and
look exceedingly wise upon the advocate acquiescence
with whom notwithstanding the offence
so lately given simon glover seemed also
to agree in opinion but not so henry smith
who seeing the consultation at a stand took up
the speech in his usual downright manner
i am neither the oldest nor the richest
among you neighbours and i am not sorry
for it years will come if one lives to see
them and i can win and spend my penny like
another by the blaze the furnace and the
wind the bellows but no man ever saw me
sit down with wrong done in word or deed to
our fair town if man's tongue and man's hand
could right it neither will i sit down with
this outrage if i can help it i will go to the
provost myself if no one will go with me he
is a knight it is true and a gentleman free
and trueborn blood as we all know since
wallace's time who settled his greatgrandsire
amongst us but if he were the proudest nobleman
in the land he is the provost perth
and for his own honour must see the freedoms
and immunities the burgh preserved ay
and i know he will i have made a steel doug
i m
blet for him and have a good guess at the kind
 heart that it was meant to cover
surely said bailie craigdallie it would
be to no purpose to stir at court without sir
patrick charteris's countenance the ready answer
would be go to your provost you borrel
loons so neighbours and townsmen if you will
stand by my side i and our pottingar divining
will repair presently to kinfauns with sin
glover the jolly smith and gallant oliver
proudfute for witnesses to the onslaught and
speak with sir patrick charteris in name 
the fair town
nay said the peaceful man medicine
leave me behind i pray you i lack audacity
to speak before a belted knight
never regard that neighbour you must
go said bailie craigdallie the town hold
me a hotheaded carle for a man threescore 
sim glover is the offended party we all know
that harry gow spoils more harnesses with his
sword than he makes with his hammer and
our neighbour proudfute who take his own
word is at the beginning and every
fray in perth is course a man action wc
must have at least one advocate amongst us for
peace and quietness and thou pottingar must
be the man away with you sirs get your boots
and your beasts horse and mattock i say and
let us meet at the east port that is if it is
your pleasure neighbours to trust us with the
matter
there can be no better rede and we will
all avouch it said the citizens if the provost
take our part as the fair town hath a
right to expect we may bellthereat with the
best them
it is well then neighbours answered the
bailie so said so shall be done meanwhile
i have called the whole towncouncil together
about this hour and i have little doubt looking
around the company that as so many 
them who are in this place have resolved to
consult with our provost the rest will be compliant
to the same resolution and therefore
neighbours and good burghers the fair city
 perth horse and mattock as i said before
and meet me at the east port
a general acclamation concluded the sitting
 this species privy council or lords the
articles and they dispersed the deputation to
prepare for the journey and the rest to tell their
impatient wives and daughters the measures
they had taken to render their chambers safe in
future against the intrusion gallants at unseasonable
hours
while nags are saddling and the towncouncil
debating or rather putting in form what
the leading members their body had already
adopted it may be necessary for the information
 some readers to state in distinct terms
what is more circuitously intimated in the course
 the former discussion
it was the custom at this period when the
strength the feudal aristocracy controlled the
rights and frequently insulted the privileges 
the royal burghs scotland that the latter
where it was practicable often chose their provost
or chief magistrate not out the order
 the merchants shopkeepers and citizens who
inhabited the town itself and filled up the roll
 the ordinary magistracy but elected to that
preeminent state some powerful nobleman or
baron in the neighbourhood the burgh who
was expected to stand their friend at court in
such matters as concerned their common weal
and to lead their civic militia to fight whether
in general battle or in private feud reinforcing
them with his own feudal retainers this protection
was not always gratuitous the provosts
sometimes availed themselves their situation
to an unjustifiable degree and obtained grants
 lands and tenements belonging to the common
good or public property the burgh and
thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance
which they afforded others were satisfied
to receive the powerful aid the townsmen
in their own feudal quarrels with such
other marks respect and benevolence as the
burgh over which they presided were willing to
gratify them with in order to secure their active
services in case necessity the baron who
was the regular protector a royal burgh accepted
such freewill offerings without scruple
and repaid them by defending the rights the
town by arguments in the council and by bold
deeds in the field
the citizens the town or as they loved
better to call it the fair city perth had for
several generations found a protector and provost
 this kind in the knightly family charters
lords kinfauns in the neighbourhood
 the burgh it was scarce a century in the
time robert iii since the first this distinguished
family had settled in the strong castle
which now belonged to them with the picturesque
and fertile scenes adjoining to it but
the history the first settler chivalrous and
romantic in itself was calculated to facilitate
the settlement an alien in the land in which
his lot was cast we relate it as it is given by
an ancient and uniform tradition which carries
in it great indications truth and is warrant
enough perhaps for its insertion in graver histories
than the present
during the brief career the celebrated patriot
sir william wallace and when his arms
had for a time expelled the english invaders
from his native country he is said to have
undertaken a voyage to france with a small
band trusty friends to try what his presence

for he was respected through all countries for
his prowess might do to induce the french
monarch to send to scotland a body auxiliary
forces or other assistance to aid the scots
in regaining their independence
the scottish champion was on board a small
vessel and steering for the port dieppe
when a sail appeared in the distance which the
mariners regarded with doubt and apprehension
and at last with confusion and dismay wallace
demanded to know what was the cause their
alarm the captain the ship informed him
that the tall vessel which was bearing down
with the purpose boarding that which he
commanded was the ship a celebrated rover
equally famed for his courage strength body
and successful piracies it was commanded by
a gentleman named thomas de longueville a
frenchman by birth but by practice one 
those pirates who called themselves friends to
the sea and enemies to all who sailed upon that
element he attacked and plundered vessels 
all nations like one the ancient norse speaking
as they were termed whose dominion weapon
the mountain waves the master added
that no vessel could escape the rover hy flight
so speedy was the bark he commanded and that
no crew however hardy could hope to resist
him when as was his usual mode combat he
threw himself on board at the head his followers

wallace smiled sternly while the master 
the ship with alarm in his countenance and
tears in his eyes described to him the certainty
 their being captured by the red rover
a name given to de longueville because he
usually displayed the bloodred flag which he
had now hoisted
i will clear the narrow seas this rover
said wallace
then calling together some ten or twelve 
his own followers boyd kerlie seton and
others to whom the dust the most desperate
battle was like the breath life he commanded
them to arm themselves and lie flat upon
the deck so as to be out sight he ordered
the mariners below excepting such as were absolutely
necessary to manage the vessel and he
gave the master instructions upon pain death
so to steer as that while the vessel had an
appearance attempting to fly he should in
fact permit the red rover to come up with
them and do his worst wallace himself then
lay down on the deck that nothing might be
seen which could intimate any purpose resistance
in a quarter an hour de montreville's
vessel ran on board that the champion
and the red rover casting out grappling
irons to make sure his prize jumped
on the deck in complete armour followed
by his men who gave a terrible shout as if
victory had been already secured but the
armed scots started up at once and the rover
found himself unexpectedly engaged with
men accustomed to consider victory as secure
when they were only opposed as one to two or
three wallace himself rushed on the pirate
captain and a dreadful strife began betwixt
them with such fury that the others suspended
their own battle to look on and seemed by
common consent to refer the issue the strife
to the fate the combat between the two
chiefs the pirate fought as well as man could
do but wallace's strength was beyond that
 ordinary mortals he dashed the sword from
the rover's hand and placed him in such peril
that to avoid being cut down he was fain to
close with the scottish champion in hopes
 overpowering him in the grapple in this
also he was foiled they fell on the deck locked
in each other's arms but the frenchman fell undermost
 and wallace fixing his grasp upon his
gorget compressed it so closely notwithstanding
it was made the finest steel that the blood
gushed from his eyes nose and mouth and he
was only able to ask for quarter by signs his
men threw down their weapons and begged for
mercy when they saw their leader thus severely
handled the victor granted them all their
lives but took possession their vessel and
detained them prisoners
when he came in sight the french harbour
wallace alarmed the place by displaying
the rover's colours as if de longueville was
coming to pillage the town the bells were rung
backward horns were blown and the citizens
were hurrying to arms when the scene changed
the scottish lion on his shield gold was
raised above the piratical flag and announced
that the champion scotland was approaching
like a falcon with his prey in his clutch he
landed with his prisoner and carried him to the
court france where at wallace's request the
robberies which the pirate had committed were
forgiven and the king even conferred the honour
 knighthood on sir thomas de longueville
and offered to take him into his service but
the rover had contracted such a friendship for
his generous victor that he insisted on uniting
his fortunes with those wallace with whom
he returned to scotland and fought by his side
in many a bloody battle where the prowess 
sir thomas de longueville was remarked as
inferior to that none save his heroic conqueror
his fate also was more fortunate than
that his patron being distinguished by the
beauty as well as strength his person he
rendered himself so acceptable to a young lady
heiress the ancient family charteris that
she choose him lor her husband bestowing on
him with her hand the fair baronial castle 
kinfauns and the domains annexed to it their
descendants took the name charteris as connecting
themselves with their maternal ancestors
the ancient proprietors the property
though the name thomas de longueville was
equally honoured amongst them and the large
twohanded sword with which he mowed the
ranks war was and is still preserved among
the family muniments another account is
that the family name de longueville himself
was charteris the estate afterwards passed
to a family blairs and is now the property
 lord gray
these barons kinfauns from father to son
held for several generations the office provost
 perth the vicinity the castle and
town rendering it a very convenient arrangement
for mutual support the sir patrick 
this history had more than once led out the men
 perth to battles and skirmishes with the restless
highland depredators and with other enemies
foreign and domestic true it is he used
sometimes to be weary the slight and frivolous
complaints unnecessarily brought before
him and in which he was requested to interest
himself hence he had sometimes incurred the
charge being too proud as a nobleman or
too indolent as a man wealth and one who
was too much addicted to the pleasures the
field and the exercise feudal hospitality to
bestir himself upon all and every occasion when
the fair town would have desired his active interference
but notwithstanding that this occasioned
some slight murmuring the citizens
upon any serious cause alarm were wont to
rally around their provost and were warmly
supported by him both in council and action
chapter vii
the character and quality sir patrick
charteris the provost perth being such as
we have sketched in the last chapter let us now
return to the deputation which was in the act
 rendezvousing at the east port in order to
wait upon that dignitary with their complaints
at kinfauns
and first appeared simon glover on a pacing
palfrey which had sometimes enjoyed the
honour bearing the fairer person as well as the
lighter weight his beautiful daughter his
cloak was muffled round the lower part his
face as a sign to his friends not to interrupt him
by any questions while he passed through the
streets and partly perhaps on account the
coldness the weather the deepest anxiety
was seated on this brow as if the more he meditated
on the matter he was engaged in the
more difficult and perilous it appeared he
only greeted by silent gestures his friends as
they came to the rendezvous
a strong black horse the old galloway
breed an under size not exceeding fourteen
hands but high shouldered stronglimbed wellcoupled
and roundbarrelled bore to the east
port the gallant smith a judge the animal
might see in his eye a spark that vicious
temper which is frequently the accompaniment
 the form that is most vigorous and enduring 
but the weight the hand and the seat the
rider added to the late regular exercise a
long journey had subdued its stubbornness for
the present he was accompanied by the honest
bonnetmaker who being as the reader is
aware a little round man had planted himself
like a red pincushion for he was wrapped ina
scarlet cloak over which he had slung a hawking
pouch on the top a great saddle which
he might be said rather to be perched upon than
to bestride the saddle and the man were girthed
on the ridgebone a great trampling flemish
mare with a nose turned up in the air
like a camel a huge fleece hair at each foot
and every hoof full as large in circumference asa
fryingpan the contrast between the beast
and the rider was so extremely extraordinary
that whilst chance passengers contented themselves
with wondering how he got up his friends
were anticipating with sorrow the perils which
must attend his coming down again for the highseated
horseman's feet did not by any means
come beneath the laps the saddle he had
associated himself to the smith whose motions
he had watched for the purpose joining him 
for it was oliver proudfute's opinion that men
 action showed to most advantage when beside
each other and he was delighted when
some wag the lower class had gravity enough
to cry out without laughing outright there
goes the pride perth there go the slashing
craftsmen the jolly smith the wynd and
the bold bonnetmaker 
it is true the fellow who gave this allhail
thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces
like himself but as the bonnetmaker
did not see this byplay he generously threw
him a silver penny to encourage his respect for
martialists this munificence occasioned their
being followed by a crowd boys laughing
and hallooing until henry smith turning back
threatened to switch the foremost them a
resolution which they did not wait to see put
in execution
here are we the witnesses said the little
man on the large horse as they joined simon
glover at the east port but where are they
that should back us ah brother henry 
authority is a load for an ass rather than a spirited
horse it would but clog the motions 
such young fellows as you and me
i could well wish to see you bear ever so
little that same weight worthy master proudfate
replied henry gow u were it but to keep
you firm in the saddle for you bounce about as
if you were dancing a jig on your seat without
any help from your legs

ay ay i raise myself in my stirrups to

something perilous so jezabel and i part not

smith
ay isabel or jezabel all the same you
know but here comes bailie craigdallie at
last with that poor creeping cowardly creature
the pottingar they have brought two townofficers
with their partizans to guard their fair
persons i suppose if there is one thing i hate
more than another it is such a sneaking varlet
as that dwining 
have a care he does not hear you say so
said the smith i tell thee bonnetmaker that
there is more danger in yonder slight wasted
anatomy than in twenty stout fellows like yourself

pshaw bully smith you are but jesting
with me said oliver softening his voice however
and looking towards the pottingar as if
to discover in what limb or lineament his
wasted face and form lay any appearance the
menaced danger and his examination reassuring
him he answered boldly blades and
bucklers man i would stand the feud a
dozen such as dwining what could he do to
any man with blood in his veins 
he could give him a dose physic answered
the smith drily
they had no time for further colloquy for
bailie craigdallie called to them to take the road
to kin fauns and himself showed the example
as they advanced at a leisurely pace the discourse
turned on the reception which they were
to expect from their provost and the interest
which he was likely to take in the aggression
which they complained the glover seemed
particularly desponding and talked more than
once in a manner which implied a wish that
they would yet consent to let the matter rest
he did not speak out very plainly however
fearful perhaps the malignant interpretation
which might be derived from any appearance 
his flinching from the assertion his daughter's
reputation dwining seemed to agree with
him in opinion but spoke more cautiously than
in the morning
after all said the bailie when i think
 all the provinces and good gifts which have
passed from the good town to my lord provost's
i cannot think he will be backward to
show himself more than one lusty boat laden
with bordeaux wine has left the south shore
to discharge its burden under the castle 
kinfauns i have some right to speak that
who was the merchant importer
and said dwining with his squeaking
voice i could speak delicate confections
curious comfits loaves waste bread and
even cakes that rare and delicious condiment
which men call sugar that have gone thitherto
help out a bridal banquet or a listening
feast or such like but alack bailie craigdallied
wine is drunk comfits are eaten and
the gift is forgotten when the flavour is past
away alas neighbour the banquet last
christmas is gone like the last year's snow
but there have been gloves full gold
pieces said the magistrate
i should know that who wrought them

said simon whose professional recollections
still mingled with whatever else might occupy
his mind one was a hawking glove for my
lady i made it something wide her ladyship
found no fault in consideration the intended
lining
well go to said bailie craigdallie the
less i lie and if these are not to the fore it is
the provost's fault and not the town's they
could neither be eat nor drunk in the shape in
which he got them
i could speak a brave armour too
said the smith but cogcm na schie as john
highlands says i think the knight kinfauns
will do his devoir by the burgh in peace
or war and it is needless to be reckoning the
town's good deeds till we see him thankless for
them
so say i cried our friend proudfute from
the top bis mare we fostering blades
never bear so base a mind as to count for wine
and walnuts with a friend like sir patrick charters
nay trust me a good woodsman like
sir patrick will prize the right hunting and
sporting over the lands the burgh as an high
privilege and one which his majesty the king's
grace excepted is neither granted to lord nor
loon save to our provost alone
as the bonnetmaker spoke there was heard
on the left hand the cry so so ivaiv waw
haw being the shout a falconer to his
hawk
methinks yonder is a fellow using the privilege
you mention who from his appearance is
neither king nor provost said the smith
ay marry i see him said the bonnetmaker
who imagined the occasion presented a
prime occasion to win honour thou and i
jolly smith will prick towards him and put
him to the question
have with you then cried the smith 
and his companion spurred his mare and went
off never doubting that gow was at his heels
but craigdallie caught henry's horse by the
reins stand fast by the standard he said 
let us see the luck our light horseman if
he procures himself a broken pate he will be
quieter for the rest the day
from what i already see said the smith
he may easily come by such a boon yonder
fellow who stops so impudently to look at us
as if he were engaged in the most lawful sport
in the world i guess him by his trotting nobler
his rusty headpiece with the cock's feather
and long twohanded sword to be the follower
 some the southland lords men who
live so near the southron that the black jack
is never off their backs and who are as free 
their blows as they are light in their fingers
whilst they were thus speculating on the
issue the rencounter the valiant bonnetmaker
began to pull up jezabel in order that the
smith who he still concluded was close behind
might overtake him and either advance
first or at least abreast himself but when
he saw him at a hundred yards distance standing
composedly with the rest the group
the flesh the champion like that the old
spanish general began to tremble in anticipation
 the dangers into which his own venturous
spirit was about to involve it yet the consciousness
 being countenanced by the neighbourhood
 so many friends the hopes that the
appearance such odds must intimidate the
single intruder and the shame abandoning
an enterprise in which he had volunteered and
when so many persons must witness his disgrace
surmounted the strong inclination which
prompted him to wheel jezabel to the right
about and return to the friends whose protection
he had quitted as fast as her legs could
carry them he accordingly continued his direction
towards the stranger who increased his
alarm considerably by putting his little nag in
motion and riding to meet him at a brisk trot
on observing this apparently offensive movement
our hero looked over his left shoulder
more than once as if reconnoitring the ground
for a retreat and in the meanwhile came to a
decided halt but the philistine was upon him
ere the bonnetmaker could decide whether to
fight or fly and a very ominouslooking philistine
he was his figure was gaunt and lathy
his visage marked by two or three illfavoured
scars and the whole man had much the air
 one accustomed to say stand and deliver
to a true man
this individual began the discourse by exclaiming
in tones as sinister as his looks 
the devil catch you for a cuckoo why do you
ride across the moor to spoil my sport 
worthy stranger said our friend in the
tone pacific remonstrance i am oliver
proudfute a burgess perth and a man 
substance and yonder is the worshipful adam
craigdallie the oldest bailie the burgh with
the fighting smith the wynd and three or
four armed men more who desire to know your
name and how you come to take your pleasure
over these lands belonging to the burgh 
perth although natheless i will answer for
them it is not their wish to quarrel with a
gentleman or stranger for any accidental trespass
 only it is their use and wont not to grant
such leave unless it is duly asked and and
therefore i desire to know your name worthy
sir
the grim and loathly aspect with which the
falconer had regarded oliver proudfute during
his harangue had greatly disconcerted him and
altogether altered the character the inquiry
which with henry gow to back him he would
probably have thought most fitting for the occasion

the stranger replied to it modified as it was
with a most inauspicious grin which the scars
 his visage made appear still more repulsive
you want to know my name my name is
the devil's dick hogarth well known in
annandale for a gentle johnstonee i follow the
stout laird wamphray who rides with his
kinsman the redoubled lord johnstonee who
is banded with the doughty earl douglas 
and the earl and the lord and the laird and i
the esquire fly our hawks where we find our
game and ask no man whose ground we ride
over
m i will do your message sir replied oliver
proudfute meekly enough for he began to be
very desirous to get free the embassy which
he had so rashly undertaken and was in the
act turning his horse's head when the anmandate
man added 
and take you this to boot to keep you in
mind that you met the devil's dick and to teach
you another time to beware how you spoil the
sport any one who wears the flying spur on
his shoulder
with these words he applied two or three
smart blows his ridingrod upon the luckless
bonnetmaker's head and person some them
lighted upon jezabel who turning sharply
round laid her rider upon the moor and galloped
back towards the party citizens
proudfute thus overthrown began to cry for
assistance in no very manly voice and almost in
the same breath to whimper for mercy for his
antagonist dismounting almost as soon as he
fell offered a linger or large wood knife to
his throat while he rifled the pockets the unlucky
citizen and even examined his hawking
bag swearing two or three grisly oaths that he
would have what it contained since the wearer
had interrupted his sport he pulled the belt
rudely off terrifying the prostrate bonnetmaker
still more by the regardless violence which he
used as instead taking the pains to unbuckle
the strap he drew till the fastening gave way
but apparently it contained nothing to his mind
he threw it carelessly from him and at the same
time suffered the dismounted cavalier to rise
while he himself remounted his hobbler and
looked towards the rest oliver's party who
were now advancing
when they had seen their delegate overthrown
there was some laughter so much had
the vaunting humour the bonnetmaker prepared
his friends to rejoice when as henry
smith termed it they saw their oliver meet
with a rowland but when the bonnetmaker's
adversary was seen to bestride him and handle
him in the manner described the armourer could
hold out no longer please you good master
bailie i cannot endure to see our townsman
beaten and rifled and like to be murdered before
us all it reflects upon the fair town and if
it is neighbour proudfute's misfortune it is our
shame i must to his rescue
we will all go to his rescue answered
bailie craigdallie but let no man strike without
order from me we have more feuds on
our hands it is to be feared than we have
strength to bring to good and therefore i
charge you all more especially you henry the
wynd in the name the fair city that you
make no stroke but in selfdefence they all
advanced therefore in a body and the appearance
 such a number drove the plunderer from
his booty he stood at gaze however at some
distance like the wolf which though it retreats
before the dogs cannot be brought to absolute
flight
henry seeing this state things spurred his
horse and advanced far before the rest the
party up towards the scene oliver proudfate's
misfortune his first task was to catch
jezabel by the flowing rein and his next to lead
her to meet her discomfited master who was
crippling towards him his clothes much soiled
with his fall his eyes streaming with tears from
pain as well as mortification and altogether exhibiting
an aspect so unlike the spruce and dapper
importance his ordinary appearance that
the honest smith felt compassion for the little
man and some remorse at having left lii exposed
to such disgrace all men i believe enjoy
an illnatured joke the difference is that
an illnatured person can drink out to very
dregs the amusement which it affords while
the bettermoulded mind soon loses the sense 
the ridiculous in sympathy for the pain the
sufferer
u let me pitch you up to your saddle again
neighbour said the smith dismounting at the
same time and assisting oliver to scramble into
his warsaddle as a monkey might have done
may god forgive you neighbour smith for
not backing me i would not have believed
in it though fifty credible witnesses had sworn
it you
such were the first words spoken in sorrow
more than anger by which the dismayed oliver
vented his feelings
the bailie kept hold my horse by the
bridle and besides henry continued with a
smile which even his compassion could not suppress
 i thought you would have accused me
 diminishing your honour if i brought you
 k
aid against a single man but cheer up the villain
took foul odds you your horse not being
well at command
that is true that is true said oliver
eagerly catching at the apology
and yonder stands the faitour rejoicing at
the mischief he has done and triumphing in
your overthrow like the king in the romance
who played upon the fiddle whilst a city was
burning come thou with me and thou shalt
see how we will handle him nay fear not
that i will desert thee this time
so saying he caught jezabel by the rein
and galloping alongside her without giving
oliver time to express a negative he rushed
toward the devil's dick who had halted on
the top a rising ground at some distance
the gentle johnstonee however either that he
thought the contest unequal or that he had
fought enough for the day snapping his fingers
and throwing his hand out with an air defiance
spurred his horse into a neighbouring
bog through which he seemed to flutter like a
wild duck swinging his lure round his head
and whistling to his hawk all the while though
any other horse and rider must have been instantly
bogged up to the saddlegirths
there goes a thoroughbred mosstrooper
said the smith that fellow will fight or flee
as suits his humour and there is no use to pursue
him any more than to hunt a wild goose
he has got your purse i doulvt me for they
seldom leave off till they are full handed
ye ye yes said proudfute in a melancholy
tone he has got my purse but
there is less matter since he hath left the 

nay the hawkingbag had been an emblem
 personal victory to be sure a trophy
as the minstrels call it
there is more in it than that friend said
oliver significantly
why that is well neighbour i love to
hear you speak in your own scholarly tone
again cheer up you have seen the villain's
back and regained the trophies you had lost
when taken at advantage
ah henry gow henry gow said the
bonnetmaker and stopped short vvitli a deep
sigh nearly amounting to a groan
what is the matter asked his friend
what is it you vex yourself about now 
i have some suspicion my dearest friend
henry smith that the villain fled for fear 
you not me i
do not think so replied the armourer 
he saw two men and fled and who can tell
whether he fled for one or the other besides
he knows by experience your strength and activity
 we all saw how you kicked and struggled
when you were on the ground
did i said poor proudfute i do not
remember it but i know it is my best point 
i am a strong dog in the loins but did they
all see it
all as much as i said the smith smothering
an inclination to laughter
but thou wilt remind them it 
be assured i will answered henry and
 thy desperate rally even now mark what
i say to bailie craigdallie and make the best
 it
vol 
it is not that i require any evidence in my
favour for i am as brave by nature as most
men in perth but only here the man 
valour paused
but only what inquired the stout armourer

but only i am afraid being killed to
leave my pretty wife and my young family you
know would be a sad change smith you will
know this when it is your own case and will
feel abated in courage
it is like that i may said the armourer
musing
then i am so accustomed to the use 
arms and so well breathed that few men can
match me it's all here said the little man
expanding his breast like a trussed fowl and
patting himself with his hands here is room
for all the wind machinery
i dare say you are longbreathed longwinded
 at least your speech betrays 
my speech you are a wag but i have
got the stern post a diamond brought up the
river from dundee
the stern post a drummond exclaimed
the armourer conscience man it will put
you in feud with the whole clan not the least
wrathful in the country as i take it
st andrew man you put me out i
mean a diamond that is a large ship i have
fixed this post in my yard and had it painted
and carved something like a soldan or saracen
and with him i breathe myself and will wield
my twohanded sword against him thrust or
point for an hour together
that must make you familiar with the use
 your weapon said the smith
ay marry does it and sometimes i will
place you a bonnet an old one most likely on
my soldan's head and cleave it with such a
downright blow that in troth the infidel has
but little his skull remaining to hit at
that is unlucky for you will lose your
practice said henry but how say you
bonnetmaker i will put on my headpiece
and corslet one day and you shall hew at me
allowing me my broadsword to parry and pay
back eh what say you 
by no manner means my dear friend
i should do you too much evil besides to tell
you the truth i strike far more freely at a helmet
or bonnet when it is set on my wooden
soldan then i am sure to fetch it down but
when there is a plume feathers in it that nod
and two eyes gleaming fiercely from under the
shadow the visor and when the whole is
dancing about here and there i acknowledge it
puts out my hand fence
so if men would but stand stock still like
your soldan you would play the tyrant with
them master proudfute 
in time and with practice i conclude i
might answered oliver but here we come
up with the rest them bailie craigdallie
looks angry but it is not his kind anger
that frightens me
you are to recollect gentle reader that as
soon as the bailie and those who attended
him saw that the smith had come up to the
forlorn bonnetmaker and that the stranger
had retreated they gave themselves no trouble
about advancing further to his assistance which
they regarded as quite insured by the presence
 the redoubled henry gow they had resumed
their straight road to kinfauns desirous
that nothing should delay the execution their
mission as some time had elapsed ere the 
and the smith rejoined the party
bailie craigdallie asked them and henry smith
in particular what they meant by dallying away
precious time by riding up hill after the falconer
by the mass it was not my fault master
bailie replied the smith if ye will couple
up an ordinary lowcountry greyhound with a
highland wolfdog you must not blame the first
 them for taking the direction in which it
pleases the last to drag him on it was so and
not otherwise with my neighbour oliver proudfate
he no sooner got up from the ground but
he mounted his mare like a flash lightning
and enraged at the unsightly advantage which
yonder rascal had taken his stumbling horse
he flew after him like a dromedary i could not
but follow both to prevent a second stumble and
secure our over bold friend and champion from
the chance some ambush at the top the
bill but the villain who is a follower some
lord the marches and wears a winged spur
for his cognizance fled from our neighbour like
fire from flint
the senior bailie perth listened with surprise
to the legend which it had pleased gow
to circulate for though not much caring for
the matter he had always doubted the bonnetmaker's
romancing account his own exploits
which hereafter he must hold as in some degree
orthodox the shrewd old glover looked closer
into the matter
you will drive the poor bonnetmaker
mad he whispered to henry and set him
aringing his clapper as if he were a townbell
on a rejoicing day when for order and decency
it were better he were silent
o by our lady father replied the smith
i love the poor little braggadocio and could
not think his sitting rueful and silent in
the provost's hall while all the rest them
and in especial that venomous pottingar were
telling their mind
thou art even too goodnatured a fellow
henry answered simon but mark the
difference betwixt these two men the harmless
little bonnetmaker assumes the airs a
dragon to disguise his natural cowardice while
the pottingar wilfully desires to show himself
timid poorspirited and humble to conceal the
danger his temper the adder is not the
less deadly that he creeps under a stone i tell
thee son henry that for all his sneaking looks
and timorous talking this wretched anatomy
loves mischief more than he fears danger 
but here we stand in front the provost's
castle and a lordly place is kinfauns and a
credit to the city it is to have the owner 
such a gallant castle for their chief magistrate
a goodly fortalice indeed said the smith
looking at the broad winding tay s it swept
under the bank on which the castle stood like
its modern successor and seemed the queen 
the valley although on the opposite side the
river the strong walls echo appeared to
dispute the preeminence echo however was
i n that age a peaceful nunnery and the walls
with which it was surrounded were the barriers
 secluded vestal not the bulwarks 
an armed garrison tis a brave castle said
the armourer again looking at the towers 
kinfauns and the breastplate and target 
the bonnie course the tay it were worth
lipping a good blade before wrong were offered
to it
the porter kinfauns who knew from a
distance the persons and characters the party
had already opened the courtyard gate for
their entrance and sent notice to sir patrick
charteris that the eldest bailie perth with
some other good citizens were approaching the
castle the good knight who was getting ready
for a hawking party heard the intimation
with pretty much the same feelings that the
modern representative a burgh hears the
menaced visitation a party his worthy
electors at a time rather unseasonable for their
reception that is he internally devoted the
intruders to mahound and termagant and
outwardly gave orders to receive them with all
lipping e making notches in a sword or knife
decorum and civility commanded the sewers to
bring hot venison steaks and cold baked meats
into the knightly ball with all dispatch and the
butler to broach bis casks and do his duty 
for if the fair city perth sometimes filled his
cellar her citizens were always equally ready
to assist at emptying his flagons
the good burghers were reverently marshalled
into the hall where the knight who
was in a ridinghabit and booted up to the
middle bis thighs received them with a
mixture courtesy and patronizing condescension
 wishing them all the while at the bottom
 the tay on account the interruption
their arrival gave to his proposed amusement
 the morning he met them in the midst 
the ball with bare head and bonnet in hand and
some such salutation as the following u ha
my master eldest bailie and you worthy simon
glover fathers the fair city and you my
learned pottingar and you stout smith 
and my slashing bonnetmaker too who cracks
more skulls than he covers how come i to have
the pleasure seeing so many friends so early 
i was thinking to see my hawks fly and your
company will make the sport more pleasant 
aside i trust in our lady they may break
their necks that is always unless the city
have any commands to lay on me butler gilbert
dispatch thou knave but i hope you
have no more grave errand than to try if the
malvoisie holds its flavour 
the city delegates answered to their provost's
civilities by inclinations and confess
more or less characteristic which the s
bow was the lowest and the smith's
the least ceremonious probably he knew his
own value as a fighting man upon occasion
to the general compliment the elder bailie replied

sir patrick charteris and our noble lord
provost said craigdallie gravely had our
errand been to enjoy the hospitality with which
we have been often regaled here our manners
would have taught us to tarry till your lordship
had invited us as on other occasions and
as to hawking we have had enough on't for
one morning since a wild fellow who was flying
a falcon hard by on the moor unhorsed and
cudgelled our worthy friend oliver bonnetmaker
or proudfute as some men call him
merely because he questioned him in your honour's
name and the town perth's who or
what he was that took so much upon him
and what account gave he himself
said the provost by st john i will teach
him to forestall my sport l
so please your lordship said the bonnetmaker
 he did take me at disadvantage but
i got on horseback again afterwards and
pricked after him gallantly he calls himself
richard the devil
how man he that the rhymes and romances
are made on said the provost i
thought that smack's name had been robert
i trow they be different my lord i only
graced this fellow with the full title for indeed
he called himself the devil's dick and said he
was a johnstonee and a follower the lord 
that name but i put him back into the bog
and recovered my hawking bag which he had
taken when i was at disadvantage
j
sir patrick paused for an instant we
have heard said he the lord johnstonee
and his followers little is to be had by
meddling with them smith tell me did you
endure this 
ay faith did i sir patrick having command
from my betters not to help
well if thou satst down with it said the
provost i see not why we should rise up 
especially as master oliver proudfute though
taken at advantage at first has as he has told us
recovered his reputation and that the burgh
but here comes the wine at length fill round
to my good friends and guests till the wine leap
over the cup prosperity to st johnston and
a merry welcome to you all my honest friends 
and now sit you to eat a morsel for the sun is
high up and it must be long since you thrifty
men have broken your fast
before we eat my lord provost said the
bailie let us tell you the pressing cause 
our coming which as yet we have not touched
upon
nay prithee bailie said the provost
put it off till thou hast eaten some complaint
against the rascally jackie and retainers 
the nobles for playing at football on the streets
 the burgh or some such goodly matter
no my lord said craigdallie stoutly and
firmly it is the jackets masters whom
we complain for playing at football with the
honour our families and using as little ceremony
with our daughters sleeping chambers as
if they were in a border at paris a party 
reiving nightwalkers courtiers and men 
rank as there is but too much reason to believe
attempted to scale the windows simon
glover's house last night they stood in their
defence with drawn weapons when they were
interrupted by henry smith and fought till
they were driven off by the rising the citizens

how said sir patrick setting down the
cup which he was about to raise to his head
cocksbody make that manifest to me and by
the soul thomas louisville i will see
you righted with my best power were it to cost
me life and land who attests this simon
glover you arc held an honest and a cautious

man do you take the truth this charge upon
your conscience 
my lord said simon understand i am
no willing complainer in this weighty matter
no damage has arisen save to the breakers 
the peace themselves i fear only great power
could have encouraged such lawless audacity 
and i were unwilling to put feud between my
native town and some powerful nobleman on
my account but it has been said that if i
hang back in prosecuting this complaint it will
be as much as admitting that my daughter expected
such a visit which is a direct falsehood
therefore my lord i will tell your lordship
what happened so far as i know and leave
further proceeding to your wisdom he then
told from point to point all that he had seen 
the attack
sir patrick charteris listening with much
attention seemed particularly struck with the
escape the man who had been made prisoner
strange he said that you did not secure
him when you had him did you not look at
him so as to know him again 
i had but the light a lantern my lord
provost and as to suffering him to escape i was
alone said the glover and old but yet i
might have kept him had i not heard my
daughter shriek in the upper room and ere i
had returned from her chamber the man had
escaped through the garden
now armourer as a true man and a good
soldier said sir patrick tell me what you
know this matter
henry gow in his own decided style gave
a brief but clear narrative the whole affair
honest proudfute being next called upon
began his statement with an air more importance
 touching this awful and astounding
tumult within the burgh i cannot altogether
it is true say with henry gow that i saw
the very beginning but it will not be denied
that i beheld a great part the latter 
and especially that i procured the evidence most
effectual to convict the knaves
and what is it man said sir patrick
charteris never lose time fumbling and
prating about it what is it 
i have brought your lordship in this pouch
what one the rogues left behind him said
the little man it is a trophy which in good
faith and honest truth i do confess i won not
by the blade but i claim the credit securing
it with that presence mind which few men
possess amidst flashing torches and clashing weapons
i secured it my lord and here it is
so saying he produced from the hawking
pouch already mentioned the stiffened hand
which had been found on the scene the skirmish

nay bonnetmaker said the provost
i'll warrant thee man enough to secure a
rogue's hand after it is cut from the body 
what do you look so busily for in your bag 
there should have been there was a ring
my lord which was on the knave's finger i
fear i have been forgetful and left it at home
for i took it off to show to my wife as she cared
not to look upon the dead hand as women love
not such sights but yet i thought i had put it
on the finger again nevertheless it must i
bethink me be at home i will ride back for it
and henry smith will trot along with me
we will all trot with thee said sir patrick
charteris since i am for perth myself
look you honest burghers and good neighbours
 perth you may have thought me unapt
to be moved by light complaints and trivial
breaches your privileges such as small trespasses
on your game the barons followers playing
football in the street and such like but
by the soul thomas longueville you shall
not find patrick charteris slothful in a matter
 this importance this hand he continued
holding up the severed joint belongs to one
who hath worked no drudgery we will put it
in a way to be known and claimed the owner
if his comrades the revel have but one spark
 honour in them hark you gerard get
me some halfscore good men instantly to
horse and let them take jack and spear meanwhile
neighbours if feud arise out this as is
most likely we must come to each other's support
if my poor house be attacked how many
men will you bring to my support 
the burghers looked at henry gow to whom
vol i p
they instinctively turned when such matters
were discussed i will answer said he for
fifty good fellows to be assembled ere the common
bell has rung ten minutes for a thousand
in the space an hour
it is well answered the gallant provost 
and in the case need i will come to aid the
fair city with such men as i can make and
now good friends let us to horse
chapter vin
it was early in the afternoon st valentine's
day that the prior the dominicans was engaged
in discharge his duties as confessor to
a penitent no small importance this was an
elderly man a goodly presence a florid and
healthful cheek the under part which was
shaded by a venerable white beard which descended
over his bosom the large and clear blue
eyes with the broad expanse brow expressed
dignity but it was a character which seemed
more accustomed to receive honours voluntarily
paid than to enforce them when they were refused
the goodnature the expression was
so great as to approach to defenceless simplicity
or weakness character unfit it might be
inferred to repel intrusion or subdue resistance
amongst the grey locks this personage
was placed a small circlet or coronet gold
upon a blue fillet his beads which were large
and conspicuous were native gold rudelyenough
wrought but ornamented with scottish
pearls rare size and beauty these were
his only ornaments and a long crimson robe 
silk tied by a sash the same colour formed
his attire his shrift being finished he arose
heavily from the embroidered cushion upon
which he kneeled during his confession and by
the assistance a crutchheaded staff ebony
moved lame and ungracefully and with apparent
pain to a chair state which surmounted
by a canopy was placed for his accommodation
by the chimney the lofty and large apartment

this was robert third the name and the
second the illfated family stewart who filled
the throne scotland he had many virtues
and was not without talent but it was his great
misfortune that like others his devoted line
his merits were not a kind suited to the part
which he was called upon to perform in life
the king so fierce a people as the scots then
were ought to have been warlike prompt and
active liberal in rewarding services strict in
punishing crimes one whose conduct should
make him feared as well as beloved the qualities
 robert the third were the reverse 
all these in youth he had indeed seen battles 
but without incurring disgrace he had never
manifested the chivalrous love war and peril
or the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerous
achievements which in that age was expected
from all who were noble birth and
had claims to authority
besides his military career was very short
amidst the tumult a tournament the young
earl carrick such was then his title received
a kick from the horse sir james douglas
 dalkeith in consequence which he was
lame for the rest his life and absolutely disabled
from taking share either in warfare or in
the military sports and tournaments which were
its image as robert had never testified m such
predilection for violent exertion he did not probably
much regret the incapacities which exempted
him from these active scenes but his
misfortune or rather its consequences lowered
him in the eyes a fierce nobility and warlike
people he was obliged to repose the principal
charge his affairs now in one member now in
another his family sometimes with the actual
rank and always with the power lieutenantgeneral
 the kingdom his paternal affection
would have induced him to use the assistance
 his eldest son a young man spirit and talent
whom in fondness he had created duke 
rothsay in order to give him the present possession
 a dignity next to that the throne
but the young prince's head was too giddy and
his hand too feeble to wield with dignity the
delegated sceptre however fond power
pleasure was the prince's favourite pursuit 
and the court was disturbed and the country
scandalized by the number fugitive amours
and extravagant revels practised by him who
should have set an example order and regularity
to the youth the kingdom
the license and impropriety the duke 
rothsay's conduct was the more reprehensible
in the public view that he was a married person
 although some over whom his youth gaiety
grace and good temper had obtained influence
were opinion that an excuse for his
libertinism might be found in the circumstances
 the marriage itself they reminded each other
that his nuptials were entirely conducted by his
uncle the duke albany by whose counsels
the infirm and timid king was much governed
at the time and who had the character managing
the temper his brother and sovereign
so as might be most injurious to the interests
and prospects the young heir by albany's
machinations the hand the heir apparent was
in a manner put up to sale as it was understood
publicly that the nobleman in scotland
who should give the largest dower to his daughter
might aspire to raise her to the bed the
duke rothsay
in the contest for preference which ensued
george earl dunbar and march who possessed
by himself or his vassals a great part 
the eastern frontier was preferred to other competitors
 and his daughter was with the mutual
good will the young couple actually contracted
to the duke rothsay
but there remained a third party to be consulted
and that was no other than the tremendous
archibald earl douglas terrible alike
from the extent his lands from the offices
and jurisdictions with which he was invested
and from his personal qualities wisdom and
valour mingled with indomitable pride and
more than the feudal love vengeance the
earl was also nearly related to the throne having
married the eldest daughter the reigning
monarch
after the espousals the duke rothsay
with the earl march's daughter douglas as
if he had postponed his share in the negotiation
to show that it could not be concluded with anyone
but himself entered the lists to break off
the contract he made a larger offer with his
daughter marjory than the earl march had
proffered and secured by his own cupidity and
fear the douglas albany exerted his influence
with the timid monarch till he was prevailed
upon to break the contract with the earl 
march and wed his son to marjory douglas a
woman whom he could not love no apology
was offered to the earl march excepting that
the espousals betwixt the prince and elizabeth
 dunbar had not been approved by the states
 parliament and that till such ratification
the contract was liable to be broken off the
earl deeply resented the wrong done to himself
and his daughter and was generally understood
to study revenge which his great influence on
the english frontier was likely to place within
his power
in the meantime the duke rothsay incensed
at the sacrifice his hand and his inclinations
to this stateintrigue took his own mode
 venting his displeasure by neglecting his
wife contemning his formidable and dangerous
fatherinlaw and showing little respect to the
authority the king himself and none whatever
to the remonstrances albany his uncle
whom he looked upon as his confirmed enemy
amid these internal dissensions his family
which extended themselves through his councils
and administration introducing everywhere
a
the baneful effects uncertainty and disunion
the feeble monarch had for some time been
supported by the counsels his queen arabella
a daughter the noble house drummond
gifted with a depth sagacity and firmness
 mind which exercised some restraint
over the levities a son who respected her and
sustained on many occasions the wavering resolution
 her royal husband but after her
death the imbecile sovereign resembled nothing
so much as a vessel drifted from her anchors
and tossed about amidst contending currents
abstractedly considered robert might be said
to doat upon his son to entertain respect and
awe for the character his brother albany so
much more decisive than his own to fear the
douglas with a terror which was almost instinctive
and to suspect the constancy the
bold but fickle earl march but his feelings
towards these various characters were so mixed
and complicated that from time to time they
showed entirely different from what they really
were and according to the interest which
had been last exerted over his flexible mind
the king would change from an indulgent to
a strict and even cruel father from a confiding
to a jealous brother or from a benignant
and bountiful to a grasping and encroaching
sovereign like the cameleon his feeble mind
reflected the colour that firmer character
upon which at the time he reposed for counsel
and assistance and when he disused the
advice one his family and employed the
counsel another it was no unwonted thing
to see a total change measures equally disrespectable
to the character the king and dangerous
to the safety the state
it followed as a matter course that the
clergy the catholic church acquired influence
over a man whose intentions were so excellent
but whose resolutions were so infirm robert
was haunted not only with a due sense the
errors he had really committed but with the
tormenting apprehensions those peccadilloes
which beset a superstitious and timid mind it
is scarcely necessary therefore to add that the
churchmen various descriptions had no small
influence over this easytempered prince though
indeed theirs was at that period an influence
from which few or none escaped however resolute
and firm purpose in affairs a temporal
character we now return from this long digression
without which what we have to relate
could not perhaps have been well understood

the king had moved with ungraceful difficulty
to the cushioned chair which under a
state or canopy stood prepared for his accommodation
and upon which he sank down with enjoyment
like an indolent man who had been
for some time confined to a constrained position
when seated the gentle and venerable
looks the good old man showed benevolence
the prior who now remained standing opposite
to the royal seat with an air deep deference
which cloaked the natural haughtiness
 his carriage was a man betwixt forty and
fifty years age but every one whose hairs
still retained their natural dark colour acute
features and a penetrating look attested the
talents by which the venerable father had acquired
his high station in the community over
which he presided and we may add in the
councils the kingdom in whose service they
were often exercised the chief objects which
his education and habits taught him to keep in
view were the extension the dominion and
the wealth the church and the suppression
 heresy both which he endeavoured to accomplish
by all the means which his situation
afforded him but he honoured his religion by
the sincerity his own belief and by the morality
which guided his conduct in all ordinary
situations the faults the prior anselm
though they led him into grievous error and
even cruelty were perhaps rather those his
age and profession his virtues were his own
these things done said the king and
the lands i have mentioned secured by my
gift to this monastery you are opinion father
that i stand as much in the good graces
 our holy mother church as to term myself
her dutiful son 
surely my liege said the prior would
to god that all her children brought to the efficacious
sacrament confession as deep a
sense their errors and as much will to make
amends for them but i speak these comforting
words my liege not to robert king 
scotland but only to my humble and devout
penitent robert stewart carrick
you surprise me father answered the
king i have little check on my conscience
for aught that i have done in my kingly office
seeing that i use therein less mine own opinion
than the advice the most wise counsellors

even therein lieth the danger my liege
replied the prior the holy father recognises
in your grace in every thought word
and action an obedient vassal the holy
church but there are perverse counsellors
who obey the instinct their wicked hearts
while they abuse the goodnature and ductility
 their monarch and under colour serving
his temporal interests take steps which are prejudicial
to those that last to eternity
king robert raised himself upright in his
chair and assumed an air authority which
though it well became him he did not usually
display
prior anselm he said if you have discovered
anything in my conduct whether as a
king or a private individual which may call
down such censures as your words intimate it
is your duty to speak plainly and i command
you to do so
my liege you shall be obeyed answered
the prior with an inclination the body
then raising himself up and assuming the
dignity his rank in the church he said
hear from me the words our holy father
the pope the successor st peter to whom
have descended the keys both to bind and to
unloose wherefore o robert scotland
hast thou not received into the see st andrews
robert wardle whom the pontiff
hath recommended to fill that see why dost
thou make profession with thy lips dutiful
service to the church when thy actions proclaim
the depravity and disobedience thy
inward soul obedience is better than sacrifices

sir prior said the monarch bearing himself
in a manner not unbecoming his loftyrank
 we may well dispense with answering
you upon this subject being a matter which
concerns us and the estates our kingdom
but does not affect our private conscience
alas said the prior and whose conscience
will it concern at the last day which
 your belted lords or wealthy burgesses will
then step between their king and the penalty
which he has incurred by following their
secular policy in matters ecclesiastical know
mighty king that were all the chivalry thy
realm drawn up to shield thee from the red
levin bolt they would be consumed like scorched
parchment before the blaze a furnace
good father prior said the king on
whose timorous conscience this kind language
seldom failed to make an impression
you surely argue over rigidly in this matter
it was during my last indisposition while the
earl douglas held as lieutenantgeneral
the regal authority in scotland that the obstruction
to the reception the primate unhappily
arose do not therefore tax me with
what happened when i was unable to conduct
the affairs the kingdom and compelled to
delegate my power to another
to your subject sire you have said
enough replied the prior but if the impediment
arose during the lieutenancy the
earl douglas the legate his holiness will
demand wherefore it has not been instantly
removed when the king resumed in his royal
hands the reins authority the black douglas
can do much more perhaps than a subject
should have power to do in the kingdom his
sovereign but he cannot stand betwixt your
grace and your own conscience or release you
from the duties to the holy church which your
situation as a king imposes upon you
father said robert somewhat impatiently
 you are over peremptory in this matter
and ought at least to wait a reasonable season
vol i o
until we have time to consider some remedy
such disputes have happened repeatedly in the
reigns our predecessors and our royal and
blessed ancestor saint david did not resign
his privileges as a monarch without making a
stand in their defence even though he was involved
in arguments with the holy father himself

and therein was that great and good king
neither holy nor saintly said the prior and
therefore was he given to be a rout and a
spoil to his enemies when he raised his sword
against the banners st peter and st paul
and st john beverley in the war as it is
still called the standard well was it for
him that like his namesake the son jesse
his sin was punished upon earth and not entered
against him at the long and dire day 
accounting
well good prior well enough this
for the present the holy see shall god
willing have no reason to complain me i
take our lady to witness i would not for the
crown i wear take the burden wronging
our mother church we have ever feared that
the earl douglas kept his eyes too much
fixed on the fame and the temporalities this
frail and passing life to feel altogether ashe
ought the claims that refer to a future
world
it is but lately said the prior that he
hath taken up forcible quarters in the monastery
 aberbrothock with his retinue a
thousand followers and the abbot is compelled
to furnish him with all he needs for horse
and man which the earl calls exercising the
hospitality which he hath a right to expect from
the foundation to which his ancestors were
contributors certain it were better to return
to the douglas his lands than to submit to such
exaction which more resembles the masterful
license highland tigers and corners than
the demeanour a christian baron
the black douglass said the king with
a sigh are a race which will not be said
nay but father prior i am myself it may
u
be an intruder this kind for my sojourning
hath been long among you and my retinue
though far fewer than the douglas's are nevertheless
enough to cumber you for their daily
maintenance and though our order is to send
out purveyors to lessen your charge as much
as may be yet if there be inconvenience it were
fitting we should remove in time
now our lady forbid said the prior
who if desirous power had nothing meanly
covetous in his temper but was even magnificent
in his generous kindness certainly the dominican
convent can afford to her sovereign the
hospitality which the house offers to every
wanderer whatever condition who will receive
it at the hands the poor servants our
patron no my royal liege come with ten
times your present train they shall neither want
a grain oats a pile straw a morsel 
bread nor an ounce food which our convent
will not supply them it is one thing to employ
the revenues the church which are
so much larger than monks ought to need or
wish for in the suitable and dutiful reception
 your royal majesty and another to have it
wrenched from us by the hands rude and
violent men whose love rapine is only limited
by the extent their power
it is well good prior said the king 
and now to turn our thoughts for an instant
from state affairs can thy reverence inform us
how the good citizens perth have begun
their valentine's day gallantly and merrily
and peacefully i hope
ki for gallantly my liege i know little 
such qualities for peacefully there were three
or four men two cruelly wounded came this
morning before daylight to ask the privilege 
girth and sanctuary pursued by a hue and cry
 citizens in their shirts with clubs bills lochaber
axes and twohanded swords crying kill
and slay each louder than another nay they
were not satisfied when our porter and watch
told them that those they pursued had taken
refuge in the galilee the church but continued
for some minutes clamouring and striking
upon the postern door demanding that the
men who had offended should be delivered upto
them i was afraid their rude noise might
have broken your majesty's rest and raised
some surprise
my rest might have been broken said the
monarch but that sounds violence should
have occasioned surprise alas reverend father
there is in scotland only one place where
the shriek the victim and threats the
oppressor are not heard and that father is 
the grave
the prior stood in respectful silence sympathizing
with the feelings a monarch whose
tenderness heart suited so ill with the condition
and manners his people
and what became the fugitives asked
robert after a minute's pause
surely sire said the prior they were
dismissed as they desired to be before daylight
 and after we had sent out to be assured
that no ambush their enemies watched them
in the vicinity they went their way in peace
you know nothing inquired the king
who the men were or the cause their taking
refuge with you 
the cause said the prior was the riot
with the townsmen hut how arising is not
known to us the custom our house is to afford
twentyfour hours uninterrupted refuge
in the sanctuary st dominic without asking
any question at the poor unfortunates who have
sought relief there if they desire to remain
for a longer space the cause their resorting
to sanctuary must be put upon the register 
the convent and praised be our holy saint
many persons escape the weight the law by
this temporary protection whom did we know
the character their crimes we might have
found ourselves obliged to render up to their
pursuers and persecutors
as the prior spoke a dim idea occurred to
the monarch that the privilege sanctuary
thus peremptorily executed must prove a severe
interruption to the course justice through
his realm but he repelled the feeling as if it
had been a suggestion satan and took care
that not a single word should escape to betray
to the churchman that such a profane thought
had ever occupied his bosom on the contrary
he hasted to change the subject
 the sun he said moves slowly on the
index after the painful information you have
given me i expected the lords my council
ere now to take order with the ravelled affairs 
this unhappy riot evil was the fortune which
gave me rule over a people among whom it
seems to me i am in my own person the only
man who desires rest and tranquillity
the church always desires peace and tranquillity
added the prior not suffering even so
general a proposition to escape the poor king's
oppressed mind without insisting on a saving
clause for the church's honour
we meant nothing else said robert
but father prior you will allow that the
church in quelling strife as is doubtless her
purpose resembles the busy housewife who
puts in motion the dust which she means to
sweep away
to this remark the prior would have made
some reply but the door the apartment was
opened and a gentleman usher announced the
duke albany
i
chapter 
if i know how to manage these affairs
thus thrust disorderly upon my hands
never believe me 
richard 
the duke albany was like his royal brother
named robert the christian name the
latter had been john until he was called to the
throne when the superstition the times observed
that the name had been connected with
misfortune in the lives and reigns john 
england john france and john baliol 
scotland it was therefore agreed that to
elude the bad omen the new king should assume
the name robert rendered dear to
scotland by the recollections robert bruce
we mention this to account for the existence
 two brothers the same christian name in
one family which was not certainly an usual
occurrence more than at the present day
albany also an aged man was not supposed
to be much more disposed for warlike
enterprise than the king himself but if he
had not courage he had wisdom to conceal and
cloak over his want that quality which once
suspected would have ruined all the plans
which his ambition had formed he had also
pride enough to supply in extremity the want
 real valour and command enough over his
nerves to conceal their agitation in other respects
he was experienced in the ways courts
calm cool and crafty fixing upon the points
which he desired to attain while they were yet
far removed and never losing sight them
though the winding paths in which he trode
might occasionally seem to point to a different
direction in his person he resembled the
king for he was noble and majestic both in stature
and countenance but he had the advantage
 his elder brother in being unencumbered
with any infirmity and in every respect lighter
and more active his dress was rich and grave
as became his age and rank and like his royal
brother he wore no arms any kind a case
 small knives supplying at his girdle the place
usually occupied by a dagger in absence a
sword
at the duke's entrance the prior after making
an obeisance respectfully withdrew to a recess
in the apartment at some distance from the
royal seat in order to leave the conversation 
the brothers uncontrolled by the presence a
third person it is necessary to mention that the
recess was formed by a window placed in the
inner front the monastic buildings called the
palace from its being the frequent residence
 the kings scotland but which was unless
on such occasions the residence the prior
or abbot the window was placed over the
principal entrance to the royal apartments and
commanded a view the internal quadrangle
 the convent formed on the right hand by
the length the magnificent church on the
left by a building containing the range cellars
with the refectory chapterhouse and
other conventual apartments rising above them
for such existed altogether independent the
space occupied by king robert and his attendants
 while a fourth row buildings showing
a noble outward front to the rising sun consisted
 a large hospital for the reception
 strangers and pilgrims and many subordinate
offices warehouses and places accommodation
for the ample stores which supplied
the magnificent hospitality the dominican
fathers a lofty vaulted entrance led
through this eastern front into the quadrangle
and was precisely opposite to the window at
which prior anselm stood so that he could see
underneath the dark arch and observe the light
which gleamed beneath it from the eastern and
open portal but owing to the height to which
he was raised and the depth the vaulted
archway his eye could but indistinctly reach
the opposite and external portal it is necessary
to notice these localities we return to the conversation
between the princely relatives
my dear brother said the king raising
the duke albany as he stooped to kiss his
hand my dear dear brother wherefore this
ceremonial are we not both sons the same
stewart scotland and the same elizabeth
more 
i have not forgot that it is so said albany
arising but i must not omit in the
familiarity the brother the respect that is
due to the king
oh true most true robin answered the
king the throne is like a lofty and barren
rock upon which flower or shrub can never
take root all kindly feelings all tender affections
are denied to a monarch a king must
not fold a brother to his heart he dare not
give way to fondness for a son 
such in some respects is the doom 
greatness sire answered albany but heaven
who removed to some distance from your
majesty's sphere the members your own family
has given you a whole people to be your
children
alas robert answered the monarch
your heart is better framed for the duties 
a sovereign than mine i see from the height at
which fate has placed me that multitude whom
you call my children i love them i wish them
well but they are many and they are distant
from me alas even the meanest them has
some beloved being whom he can clasp to his
heart and upon whom he can lavish the fondness
 a father but all that a king can give
to a people is a smile such as the sun bestows
on the snowy peaks the grampian mountains
as distant and as ineffectual alas robin 
our father used to caress us and if he chid us
it was with a tone kindness yet he was a
monarch as well as i and wherefore should not
i be permitted like him to reclaim my poor
prodigal by affection as well as severity 
had affection never been tried my liege
replied albany in the tone one who delivers
sentiments which he grieves to utter means
 gentleness ought assuredly to be first made
use your grace is best judge whether they
have been long enough persevered in and whether
those discouragement and restraint may
not prove a more effectual corrective it is exclusively
in your royal power to take what
measures with the duke rothsay you think
will be most available to his ultimate benefit
and that the kingdom
this is unkind brother said the king 
m you indicate the painful path which you would
have me pursue yet you offer me not your support
in treading it
my support your grace may ever command
replied albany but would it become
me all men on earth to prompt to your
grace severe measures against your son and
heir me on whom in case failure which
heaven forefend your grace's family this
fatal crown might descend would it not bethought
and said by the fiery march and the
haughty douglas that albany had sown dissension
between his royal brother and the heir
to the scottish throne perhaps to clear the way
for the succession his own family no my
liege i can sacrifice my life to your service
but i must not place my honour in danger
you say true robin you say very true
replied the king hastening to put his own interpretation
upon his brother's words wo
s

must not suffer these powerful and dangerous
lords to perceive that there is aught like discord
in the royal family that must be avoided 
all things and therefore we will still try indulgent
measures in hopes correcting the follies
 roth say i behold sparks hope in him
robin from time to time that are well worth
cherishing he is young very young a prince
and in the heyday his blood we will have
patience with him like a good rider with a hottempered
horse let him exhaust this idle humour
and no one will be better pleased with
him than yourself you have censured me in
your kindness for being too gentle too retired
rothsay has no such defects
i will pawn my life he has not replied
albany drily
and he wants not reflection as well as
spirit continued the poor king pleading the
cause his son to his brother i have sent
for him to attend council today and we shall
see how he acquits himself his devoir you
yourself allow robin that the prince wants
vol igl
 audience dressed in the ordinary riding garb
 the time and wearing his poniard he had
left in the anteroom the page honour who
carried his sword the earl was a wellbuilt
handsome man faircomplexioned with a considerable
profusion lightcoloured hair and
bright blue eyes which gleamed like those a
falcon he exhibited in his countenance otherwise
pleasing the marks a hasty and irritable
temper which his situation as a high and
powerful feudal lord had given him but too
many opportunities indulging
i am glad to see you my lord march
said the king with a gracious inclination his
person k you have been long absent from our
councils
m my liege answered march with a deep
reverence to the king and a haughty and formal
inclination to the duke albany if i
have been absent from your grace's councils
it is because my place has been supplied by more
acceptable and i doubt not abler counsellors
and now i come but to say to your highness
that the news from the english frontier make
it necessary that i should return without delay
to my own estates your grace has your wise
and politic brother my lord albany with
whom to consult and the mighty and warlike
earl douglas to carry your councils into effect
i am no use save in my own country 
and thither with your highness's permission
i am purposed instantly to return to attend my
charge as warden the eastern marches 
you will not deal so unkindly with us
cousin replied the gentle monarch here
are evil tidings on the wind these unhappy
highland clans are again breaking into general
commotion and the tranquillity even our
own court requires the best our council to
advise and the bravest our barons to execute
what may be resolved upon the descendant
 thomas randolph will not surely
abandon the grandson robert bruce at such
a period as this 
i leave with him the descendant the farfamed
james douglas answered march
it is his lordship's boast that he never puts
foot in stirrup but a thousand horse mount with
him as his daily lifeguard and i believe the
monks aberbrothock will swear to the fact

surely with all the douglas's chivalry they
are fitter to restrain a disorderly swarm 
highland kerne than i can be to withstand the
archery england and power henry hotspur
 and then here is his grace albany
so jealous in his care your highness's person
that he calls your brandanes to take arms when
a dutiful subject like myself approaches the
court with a poor halfscore horse the retinue
 the meanest the petty barons who own
a tower and a thousand acres barren heath
when such precautions are taken where there
is not the slightest chance peril since i trust
none was to be apprehended from me your
royal person will surely be suitably guarded in
real danger
my lord march said the duke albany
 the meanest the barons whom you
speak put their followers in arms even when
they receive their dearest and nearest friends
within the iron gate their castle and if it
please our lady i will not care less for the
king's person than they do for their own the
brandanes are the king's immediate retainers
and household servants and an hundred them

is but a small guard round his grace when
yourself my lord as well as the earl douglas
often ride with ten times the number
my lord duke replied march when
the service the king requires it i can ride
with ten times as many horse as your grace has
named but i have never done so either traitorously
to entrap the king nor boastfully to
overawe other nobles
brother robert said the king ever anxious
to be a peacemaker you do wrong
even to intimate a suspicion my lord 
march and you cousin march misconstrue
my brother's caution but hark to
divert this angry parley i hear no unpleasing
touch minstrelsy you know the gay
science my lord march and love it well 
step to yonder window beside the holy prior
at whom we make no question touching secular
pleasures and you will tell us if the music and
lay be worth listening to the notes are 
france i think my brother albany's judgment
is not worth a cockleshell in such matters
 so you cousin must report your opinion
whether the poor gleemaiden deserves recompense
our son and the douglas will presently
be here and then when our council is assembled
we will treat graver matters
with something like a smile on his proud
brow march withdrew into the recess the
window and stood there in silence beside the
prior like one who while he obeyed the king's
command saw through and despised the timid
precaution which it implied as an attempt to
prevent the dispute betwixt albany and himself
the tune which was played upon a viol
was gay and sprightly in the commencement
with a touch the wildness the troubadour
music but as it proceeded the faltering
tones the instrument and the female voice
which accompanied it became plaintive and interrupted
a if choked by the painful feelings
 the minstrel
the offended earl whatever might be his
judgment in such matters on which the king
had complimented him paid it may be supposed
little attention to the music the female
minstrel his proud heart was struggling between
the allegiance he owed his sovereign as
well as the love he still found lurking in his
bosom for the person his wellnatured king
and a desire vengeance arising out his
disappointed ambition and the disgrace done
to him by the substitution marjory douglas
to be bride the heirapparent instead his
betrothed daughter march had the vices and
virtues a hasty and uncertain character and
even now when he came to bid the king adieu
with the purpose renouncing his allegiance as
soon as he reached his own feudal territories he
felt unwilling and almost unable to resolve
upon a step so criminal and so full peril it
was with such dangerous cogitations that he
was occupied during the beginning the gleemaiden's
lay but objects which called his attention
powerfully as the songstress proceeded
affected the current his thoughts and riveted
them on what was passing in the courtyard
 the monastery the song was in the provencal
dialect well understood as the language 
poetry in all the courts europe and particularly
in scotland it was more simply turned
however than was the general caste the
sirventes and rather resembled the lai a
norman minstrel it may be translated thus 
fie ta good loufee
ah poor louise the livelong day
she roams from cot to castle gay 
and still her voice and viol say
ah maids beware the woodland way
think on louise 
ah poor louise the sun was high
it smirch'd her cheek it dimm'd her eye
the woodland walk was cool and nigh
where birds with chiming streamlets vie
to cheer louise
ah poor louise the savage bear
made ne'er that lovely grove his lair 
the wolves molest not paths so fair 
but better far had such been there
for poor louise
ah poor louise in woody wold
she met a huntsman fair and bold 
his aldrich was silk and gold
and many a witching tale he told
to poor louise
ah poor louise small cause to pine
hadst thou for treasures the mine 
for peace mind that gift divine
and spotless innocence were thine
ah poor louise 
ah poor louise thy treasure's reft 
i know not if by force or theft
or part by violence part by gift 
but misery is all that's left
to poor louise
let poor louise some succour have 
she will not long your bounty crave
or tire the gay with warning stave 
for heaven has grace and earth a grave
for poor louise
the song was no sooner finished than anxious
lest the dispute should be revived betwixt
his brother and the earl march king
robert called to the latter what think you
 the minstrelsy my lord methinks as i
heard it even at this distance it was a wild and
pleasing lay
my judgment is not deep my lord but
the singer may dispense with my approbation
since she seems to have received that his
grace rothsay the first judge in scotland

how said the king in alarm is my
son below 
he is sitting on horseback by the glec
maiden said march with a malicious smile
on his cheek ft apparently as much interested
by her conversation as her music
how is this father prior said the king
but the prior drew back from the lattice
i have no will to see my lord things
which it would pain me to repeat
how is all this said the king who coloured
deeply and seemed about to rise from his
chair but changed his mind as if unwilling
perhaps to look upon some unbecoming prank
 the wild young prince which he might not
have had heart to punish with necessary severity
the earl march seemed to have a pleasure
in informing him that which doubtless
he desired to remain ignorant
 my liege he cried this is better and
better the gleemaiden has not only engaged
the ear the prince scotland as well as 
every groom and trooper in the courtyard but
she has riveted the attention the black douglas
whom we have not known as a passionate
admirer the gay science but truly i
do not wonder at his astonishment for the prince
j
has honoured the fair professor song and viol
with a kiss approbation
how cried the king is rothsay trifling
with a gleemaiden and his wife's father
in presence go my good father abbot call
the prince here instantly go my dearest brother
 and when they had both left the
room the king continued go good cousin 
march there will be mischief i am assured 
it i pray you go cousin and second my lord
prior's prayers with my commands
you forget my liege said march with
the voice a deeply offended person the father
 elizabeth dunbar were but an unfit
intercessor between the douglas and his royal
soninlaw
i crave your pardon cousin said the gentle
old man i own you have had some wrong
but my rothsay will be murdered i must
go myself
but as he arose precipitately from his chair
the poor king missed a footstep stumbled and
fell heavily to the ground in such a manner
that his head striking the corner the seat
from which he had risen he became for a minute
insensible the sight the accident at
once overcame march's resentment and melted
his heart he ran to the fallen monarch
and replaced him in his seat using in the tenderest
and most respectful manner such means
as seemed most fit to recall animation robert
opened his eyes and gazed around with uncertainty

what has happened are we alone who
is with us 
your dutiful subject march replied the
earl
alone with the earl march repeated
the king his still disturbed intellects receiving
some alarm from the name a powerful chief
whom he had reason to believe he had mortally
offended
yes my gracious liege with poor george
 dunbar whom many have wished your
majesty to think ill though he will be found
truer to your royal person at the last than they
will
indeed cousin you have had too much
wrong and believe me we shall strive to redress
 
if your grace thinks so it may yet be
righted interrupted the earl the prince and
marjory douglas are nearly related the dispensation
from rome was informally granted
their marriage cannot be lawful the pope
who will do much for so godly a prince can set
aside this unchristian union in respect the
precontract bethink you well my liege continued
the earl kindling with a new train 
ambitious thoughts to which the unexpected opportunity
 pleading his cause personally had
given rise bethink you how you choose betwixt
the douglas and me he is powerful and
mighty i grant but george dunbar wears
the keys scotland at his belt and could bring
an english army to the gates edinburgh ere
douglas could leave the skirts charitable to
oppose them your royal son loves my poor deserted
girl and hates the haughty marjory 
douglas your grace may judge the small account
in which he holds her by his toying with
a common gleemaiden even in the presence 
her father
the king had hitherto listened to the earl's
argument with the bewildered feelings a
timid horseman borne away by an impetuous
steed whose course he can neither arrest nor
direct but the last words awakened in his recollection
the sense his son's immediate danger

oh ay most true my son the douglas
oh my dear cousin prevent blood and all
shall be as you will hark there is a tumult 
that was the clash arms
by my coronet by my knightly faith it
is true said the earl looking from the window
upon the inner square the convent now
filled with armed men and brandished weapons
and resounding with the clash armour
the deepvaulted entrance was crowded with
warriors at its farthest extremity and blows
seemed to be in the act being exchanged
betwixt some who were endeavouring to shut
the gate and others who contended to press in
i will go instantly said the earl marchand
soon quell this sudden broil humbly
vol i s
i pray your majesty to think on what i have
had the boldness to propose
i will i will fair cousin said the king
scarce knowing to what he pledged himself 
do but prevent tumult and bloodshed 
chapter x
we must here trace a little more correctly
the events which had been indistinctly seen
from the window the royal apartments and
yet more indistinctly reported by those who
witnessed them the gleemaiden already mentioned
had planted herself where a rise two
large broad steps giving access to the main
gateway the royal apartments gained her
an advantage a foot and a half in height
over those in the court whom she hoped to
form an audience she wore the dress her
calling which was more gaudy than rich and
showed the person more than did the garb 
other females she had laid aside an upper
mantle and a small basket which contained her
slender stock necessaries and a little french
spaniel dog sat beside them as their protector
an azureblue jacket embroidered with silver
and sitting close to the person was open in
front and showed several waistcoats differ en t
coloured silks calculated to set off the symmetry
 the shoulders and bosom and remaining
open at the throat a small silver chain worn
around her neck involved itself amongst these
brilliantcoloured waistcoats and was again
produced from them to display a medal the
same metal which intimated in the name 
some court or guild minstrels the degree
she had taken in the gay or joyous science
a small scrip suspended over her shoulders by
a blue silk ribband hung on her left side
her sunny complexion snowwhite teeth
brilliant black eyes and raven locks marked
her country lying far in the south france
and the arch smile and dimpled chin bore
the same character her luxuriant locks twisted
around a small gold bodkin were kept
in their position by a net silk and gold
short petticoats deeplaced with silver to correspond
with the jacket red stockings which
were visible to near the calf the leg and
buskins spanish leather completed her adjustment
which though far from new had been
saved as an untarnished holiday suit which much
care had kept in good order she seemed about
twentyfive years old but perhaps fatigue and
wandering had anticipated the touch time
in obliterating the freshness early youth
we have said the gleemaiden's manner was
lively and we may add that her smile and repartee
were ready but her gaiety was assumed
as a quality essentially necessary to her
trade which it was one the miseries that
the professors were obliged frequently to cover
an aching heart with a compelled smile this
seemed to be the case with louise who whether
she was actually the heroine her own
song or whatever other cause she might have
for sadness showed at times a strain deep
melancholy thought which interfered with and
controlled the natural flow lively spirits
which the practice the joyous science especially
required she lacked also even in her
gayest sallies the decided boldness and effrontery
 her sisterhood who were seldom at a
loss to retort a saucy jest or turn the laugh
against any who interrupted or interfered with 
them
it may be here remarked that it was impossible
that this class women very numerous
in that age could bear a character generally
respectable they were however protected
by the manners the time and such were the
immunities they possessed by the rights chivalry
that nothing was more rare than to hear
 such errant damsels sustaining injury or
wrong and they passed and repassed safely
where armed travellers would probably have encountered
a bloody opposition but though
licensed and protected in honour their tuneful
art the wandering minstrels male or female
like similar ministers to the public amusement
the itinerant musicians for instance
and strolling comedians our own day led a
life too irregular and precarious to be accounted
a creditable part society indeed among
the stricter catholics the profession was considered
as unlawful
such was the damsel who with viol in
hand and stationed on the slight elevation we
have mentioned stepped forward to the bystanders
and announced herself as a mistress
 the gay science duly qualified by a brief from
a court love and music held at aix in
provence under the countenance the flower
 chivalry the gallant count aimer who now
prayed that the cavaliers merry scotland who
were known over the wide world for bravery and
courtesy would permit a poor stranger to try
whether she could afford them any amusement
by her art the love song was like the love
 fight a common passion the age which
all at least affected whether they actually possessed
it or no therefore the acquiescence in
louise's proposal was universal at the same
time an aged darkbrowed monk who was
among the bysanders thought it necessary to
remind the gleemaiden that since she was tolerated
within these precincts which was an
unusual grace he trusted nothing would be sunjr
or said inconsistent with the holy character 
the place
the gleemaiden bent her head low shook
her sable locks and crossed herself reverentially
as if she disclaimed the possibility such a
transgression and then began the song poor
louise which we gave at length in the last
chapter
just as she commenced she was stopped by
a cry for room room place for the duke
 rothsay 
nay hurry no man on my score said a
gallant young cavalier who entered on a noble
arabian horse which he managed with exquisite
grace though by such slight handling the
reins such imperceptible pressure the limbs
and sway the body that to any eye save that
 an experienced horseman the animal seemed
to be putting forth his paces for his own amusement
and thus gracefully bearing forward a
rider who was too indolent to give himself any
trouble about the matter
the prince's apparel which was very rich
was put on with slovenly carelessness his
form though his stature was low and his
limbs extremely slight was elegant in the extreme
and his features no less handsome but
there was on his brow a haggard paleness which
seemed the effect care or dissipation or
 both these wasting causes combined his
eyes were sunk and dim as from late indulgence
in revelry on the preceding evening while his
cheek was inflamed with unnatural red as if
either the effect the bacchanalian orgies had
not passed away from the constitution or a
morning draught had been resorted to in order
to remove the effects the night's debauchery
such was the duke roth say and heir 
the scottish crown a sight at once interest
and compassion all unbonneted and made
way for him while he kept repeating carelessly
no haste no haste i shall arrive soon enough
at the place i am bound for how's this a
damsel the joyous science ay by st giles 
and a comely wench to boot stand still my
merry men never was minstrelsy marred forme
 a good voice by the mass begin me
that lay again sweetheart
louise did not know the person who addressed
her but the general respect paid by all
around and the easy and indifferent manner in
which it was received showed her she was addressed
by a man the highest quality she
recommenced her lay and sung her best accordingly
 while the young duke seemed thoughtful
and rather affected towards the close the
ditty but it was not his habit to cherish such
melancholy affections this is a plaintive ditty
my nutbrown maid said he chucking the
retreating gleemaiden under the chin and detaining
her by the collar her dress which was
not difficult as he sat on horseback so close to
the steps on which she stood but i warrant
me you have livelier notes at will ma bella tenebraska
 ay and canst sing in bower as well as
wold and by night as well as day
i am no nightingale my lord said louise
endeavouring to escape a species gallantry
which illsuited the place and circumstances a
discrepancy to which he who addressed it to
her seemed contemptuously indifferent
what hast thou there darling he added
removing his hold from her collar to the scrip
which she carried
glad was louise to escape his grasp by slipping
the knot the ribband and leaving the
little bag in the prince's hand as retiring back
beyond his reach she answered nuts my
lord the last season
the prince pulled out a handful nuts accordingly
 nuts child they will break
thine ivory teeth hurt thy pretty voice said
rothsay cracking one with his teeth like a
village schoolboy
they are not the walnuts my own
sunny clime my lord said louise but they
hang low and are within the reach the
poor
you shall have something to give you better
fare poor wandering ape said the duke
in a tone in which feeling predominated more
than in the affected and contemptuous gallantry
 his first address to the glee maiden
at this moment as he turned to ask an attendant
for his purse the prince encountered
the stern and piercing look a tall black man
seated on a powerful irongrey horse who had
entered with attendants while the duke 
rothsay was engaged with louise and now remained
stupefied and almost turned to stone by
his surprise and anger at this unseemly spectacle
even one who had never seen the black
douglas must have known him by his swart
complexion his gigantic frame his buffcoat 
bell'shide and his air courage firmness and
sagacity mixed with the most indomitable pride
the loss an eye in battle though not perceptible
at first sight as the ball the ins used
organ remained similar to the other gave yet
a stern immovable glare to the whole aspect
the meeting the royal soninlaw with his
terrible step father was in circumstances which
arrested the attention all present and the
bysanders waited the issue with silence and
suppressed breath lest they should lose any part
 what was to ensue
when the duke rothsay saw the expression
which occupied the stern features douglas
and remarked that the earl did not make
the least motion towards respectful or even
civil salutation he seemed determined to show
him how little respect he was disposed to pay to
his displeased looks he took his purse from
his chamberlain
here pretty one he said i give thee
one gold piece for the song thou hast sung
me another for the nuts i have stolen from
thee and a third for the kiss thou art about to
give me for know my pretty one that when
fair lips and thine for fault better may be
called so make sweet music for my pleasure
i am sworn to st valentine to press them to
mine
my song is recompensed nobly said louise
shrinking back my nuts are sold to a good
market farther traffic my lord were neither
befitting you nor beseeming me
what you coy it my nymph the highway
said the prince contemptuously know
damsel that one asks you a grace who is unused
to denial
it is the prince scotland the duke
tf
 rothsay said the courtiers around to the
terrified louise pressing forward the trembling
young woman you must not thwart his humour

but i cannot reach your lordship she
said you sit so high on horseback
if i must alight said rothsay there
shall be the heavier penalty what does the
wench tremble for place thy foot on the toe
 my boot give me hold thy hand gallantly
done he kissed her as she stood thus suspended
in the air perched upon his foot and
supported by his hand saying there is thy
kiss and there is my purse to pay it and to
grace thee farther rothsay will wear thy scrip
for the day he suffered the frightened girl to
spring to the ground and turned his looks from
her to bend them contemptuously on the earl
 douglas as if he had said all this i do in
despite you and your daughter's claims
by st bride douglas said the earl
pressing towards the prince this is too much
unmannered boy as void sense as honour 
you know what considerations restrain the hand
 douglas else had you never dared m
can you play at spangcockle my lord
said the prince placing a nut on the second
joint his forefinger and spinning it off by a
smart application the thumb the nut struck
on douglas's broad breast who burst out into
a dreadful exclamation wrath inarticulate
but resembling the growl a lion in depth and
sternness expression i cry your pardon
most mighty lord said the duke rothsay
scornfully while all around trembled i did
not conceive my pellet could have wounded you
seeing you wear a buffcoat surely i trust it
did not hit your eye 
the prior dispatched by the king as we
have seen in the last chapter had by this time
made way through the crowd and laying hold
on douglas's rein in a manner that made it impossible
for him to advance reminded him that
the prince was the son his sovereign and
the husband his daughter
fear not sir prior said douglas i
despise the childish boy too much to raise a
finger against him but i will return insult for
insult here any you who love the douglas
spurn me this quean from the monastery
gates and let her be so scourged that she may
bitterly remember to the last day her life
how she gave means to an respective boy to
affront the douglas 
four or five retainers instantly stepped forth
to execute commands which were seldom uttered
in vain and heavily would louise have
atoned for an offence which she was alike
the innocent unconscious and unwilling instrument
had not the duke rothsay interfered

spurn the poor gleewoman he said in
high indignation scourge her for obeying
my commands spurn thine own oppressed
vassals rude earl scourge thine own faulty
hounds but beware how you touch so much
as a dog that rothsay hath patted on the head
far less a female whose lips he hath kissed 
before douglas could give an answer which
would certainly have been in defiance there
arose that great tumult at the outward gate 
the monastery already noticed and men both
on horseback and on foot began to rush headlong
in not actually fighting with each other
but certainly in no peaceable manner
the contending parties seemingly were partizans
 douglas known by the cognizance
 the bloody heart and citizens the town
 perth it appeared they had been skirmishing
in earnest when without the gates but out 
respect to the sanctified ground they lowered
their weapons when they entered and confined
their strife to a war words and mutual abuse
the tumult had this good effect that it forced
asunder by the weight and press numbers
the prince and douglas at a moment
when the levity the former and the pride 
the latter were urging them to the utmost extremity
but now peacemakers interfered on all
sides the prior and the monks threw themselves
among the multitude and commanded
peace in the name heaven and reverence to
their sacred walls under penalty excommunication
 and their expostulations began to be
listened to albany who was dispatched by his
royal brother at the beginning the fray had
not arrived till now on the scene action he
vol i t
instantly applied himself to douglas and in his
ear conjured him to temper his passion
by st bride douglas i will be avenged 
said the earl no man shall brook life after
he has passed an affront on douglas
why so you may be avenged in fitting
time said albany bullet it not be said
that like a peevish woman the great douglas
could choose neither time nor place for his vengeance
bethink you all that we have laboured
at is like to be upset by an accident george
 dunbar hath had the advantage an audience
with the old man and though it lasted but
five minutes i fear it may endanger the dissolution
 your family match which we brought
about with so much difficulty the authority
from rome has not yet been obtained
a toy answered douglas haughtily 
m they dare not dissolve it
not while douglas is at large and in possession
 his power answered albany but
noble earl come with me and i will show you
at what disadvantage you stand
douglas dismounted and followed his wily
accomplice in silence in a lower hall they saw
l
the ranks the brandanes drawn up wellarmed
in caps steel and shirts mail
their captain making an obeisance to albany
seemed to desire to address him
u what now maclouis said the duke
we are informed the duke rothsay has
been insulted and i can scarce keep the bran
danes within door
u gallant maclouis said albany and
you my trusty brandanes the duke rothsay
my princely nephew is as well as a hopeful
gentleman can be some scuffle there has been
but all is appeased he continued to draw
the earl douglas forward m you see my
lord he said in his ear that if the word arrest
was to be once spoken it would be soon
obeyed and you are aware your attendants are
few for resistance
douglas seemed to acquiesce in the necessity
 patience for the time if my teeth he
said should bite through my lips i will b
silent till it is the hour to speak out
george march in the meanwhile had a
more easy task pacifying the prince mv
lord rothsay be said approaching him
with grave ceremony i need not tell you that
you owe me something for reparation honour
though i blame not you personally for the
breach contract which has destroyed the peace
 my family let me conjure you by what observance
your highness may owe an injured
man to forego for the present this scandalous
dispute
my lord i owe you much replied rothsay
 but this haughty and all controlling lord
has wounded mine honour
my lord i can but add your royal father
is ill hath swooned with terror for your highness's
safety
rl the kind good old man swooned
said you my lord march i am with him
in an instant
the duke rothsay sprung from his saddle
to the ground and was dashing into the palace
like a greyhound when a feeble grasp was laid
on his cloak and the faint voice a kneeling
female exclaimed protection my noble
prince protection for a helpless stranger 
 hands off stroller said the earl march
thrusting the suppliant gleemaiden aside
but the gentler prince paused it is true
he said i have brought the vengeance an
unforgiving devil upon this helpless creature
o heaven what a life is mine so fatal to all
who approach me what to do in the hurry 
she must not go to my apartments and all
my men are such born reprobates ha thou
at mine elbow honest harry smith what
dost thou here 
there has been something a fight my
lord answered our acquaintance the smith
between the townsmen and the southland
loons who ride with the douglas and we have
winged them as far as the abbeygate
lam glad it i am glad it and you
beat the knaves fairly 
fairly does your highness ask said
henry why ay we were stronger in numbers
to be sure but no men ride better armed
than those who follow the bloody heart and
so in a sense we beat them fairly for as your
highness knows it is the smith who makes the
menatarms and men with good weapons area
match for great odds
while they thus talked the earl march
ivho had spoken with some one near the palace
gate returned in anxious haste my lord
duke my lord duke your father is recovered
and if you haste not speedily my lord
 albany and the douglas will have possession
 his royal ear
 and if my royal father is recovered said
the thoughtless prince and is holding or
about to hold council with my gracious uncle
and the earl douglas it befits neither your
lordship nor me to intrude till we are summoned
so there is time for me to speak my
little business with mine honest armourer here
does your highness take it so said the
earl whose sanguine hopes a change favour
at court had been too hastily excited and
were as speedily checked then so let it befor
george dunbar
he glided away with a gloomy and displeased
aspect and thus out the two most powerful
noblemen in scotland at a time when the aristocracy
so closely controlled the throne the reckless
heirapparent had made two enemies the
one by scornful defiance and the other by careless
neglect he heeded not the earl march's
departure however or rather he felt relieved
from his importunity
the prince went on in indolent conversation
with our armourer whose skill in his art
had made him known to many the great lords
about the court
i had something to say to thee smithcanst
thou take up a fallen link in my milan
hauberk 
as well please your highness as my mother
could take up a stitch in the nets she wove
the meaner shall not know my work from
his own
well but that was not what i wished 
thee just now said the prince recollecting
himself this poor glee woman good smith
she must be placed in safety thou art man
enough to be any woman's champion and thou
must conduct her to some place safety
henry smith was as we have seen sufficiently
rash and daring when weapons were in
question but he had also the pride a decent
burgher and was unwilling to place himself in
what might be thought equivocal circumstances
by the sober part his fellowcitizens
may it please your highness he said u i
am but a poor craftsman but though my arm
and sword are at the king's service and your
highness's i am with reverence no squire 
dames your highness will find among your
own retinue knights and lords willing enough
to play sir pandarus troy it is too knightly
a part for poor hal the wynd
humph hah said the prince my
purse edgar his attendant whispered him
true true i gave it to the poor wench i
know enough your craft and craftsmen in
general to be aware that men lure not hawks
with empty hands but i suppose my word
may pass for the price a good armour and
i will pay it thee with thanks to boot for this
slight service
your highness may know other craftsmen
said the smith but with reverence
you know not henry gow he will obey you
in making a weapon or in welding one but he
knows nothing this petticoat service
hark thee thou perthshire mule said
the prince yet smiling while he spoke at the
sturdy punctilio the honest burgher the
wench is as little to me as she is to thee butin
an idle moment as you may learn from those
about thee if thou safest it not thyself i did
her a passing grace which is likely to cost the
poor wretch her life there is no one here whom
i can trust to protect her against the discipline
 belt and bowstring with which the border
brutes who follow douglas will beat her to
death since such is his pleasure
if such be the case my liege she has a
right to every honest man's protection and
since she wears a petticoat though i would it
were longer and a less fanciful fashion i
will answer for her protection as well as a single
man may but where am i to bestow
her 
good faith i cannot tell said the prince
take her to sir john ramorny's lodging
but no no he is ill at ease and besides there
are reasons take her to the devil if thou wilt
but place her in safety and oblige robin 
rothsay
my noble prince said the smith i think
 always with reverence that i would rather
give a defenceless woman to the care the devil
than sir john ramorny but though the
devil be a worker in fire like myself yet i know
not his haunts and with aid holy church
hope to keep him on terms defiance and
moreover how i am to convey her out this
crowd or through the streets in such a mumming
habit may be well made a question
for the leaving the convent said the
prince this good monk seizing upon the
nearest by his cowl father nicholas or boniface

poor brother cyprian at your highness s
command said the father
ay ay brother cyprian continued the
prince yes brother cyprian shall let you
out at some secret passage which he knows 
and i will see him again to pay a prince's
thanks for it
the churchman bowed in acquiescence and
poor louise who during this debate had looked
from the one speaker to the other hastilysaid
 i will not scandalize this good man with
my foolish garb i have a mantle for ordinary
wear
why there smith thou hast a friars hood
and a woman's mantle to shroud thee under i
would all my frailties were as well shrouded 
farewell honest fellow i will thank thee hereafter

then as if afraid farther objection on the
smith's part he hastened into the palace
henry gow remained stupefied at what had
passed and at finding himself involved in a
charge at once inferring much danger and an
equal risk scandal both which joined to a
principal share which he had taken with his
usual forwardness in the fray might he saw
do him no small injury in the suit he pursued
most anxiously at the same time to leave a
defenceless creature to the ill usage the barbarous
collegians and licentious followers 
the douglas was a thought which his manly
heart could not brook for an instant
he was roused from his reverie by the voice
 the monk who sliding out his words with
the indifference which the holy fathers entertained
or affected towards all temporal matters
desired them to follow him the smith put
himself in motion with a sigh much resembling
a groan and without appearing exactly connected
with the monk's motions he followed
him into a cloister and through a postern door
which after looking once behind him the priest
left ajar behind them followed louise who
had hastily assumed her small bundle and calling
her little fourlegged companion had eagerly
followed in the path which opened an escape
from what had shortly before seemed a great
and inevitable danger
chapter xi
the party were now by a secret passage
admitted within the church the outward doors
 which usually left open had been closed
against every one in consequence the recent
tumult when the rioters both parties had
endeavoured to rush into it for other purposes
than those devotion they traversed the
gloomy aisles whose arched roof resounded
to the heavy tread the armourer but was
silent under the standard foot the monk and
the light step poor louise who trembled
excessively as much from fear as cold she
saw that neither her spiritual nor temporal conductor
looked kindly upon her the former
was an austere man whose aspect seemed to
hold the luckless wanderer in some degree 
horror as well as contempt while the latter
though as we have seen one the best natured
men living was at present grave to the
pitch sternness and not a little displeased
with having the part he was playing forced
upon him without as he was constrained to
feel a possibility his declining it
his dislike at his task extended itself to
the innocent object his protection and he
internally said to himself as he surveyed her
scornfully a proper queen beggars to
walk the streets perth with and i a decent
burgher this tawdry minion must have as
ragged a reputation as the rest her sisterhood
and i am finely sped if my chivalry in
her behalf comes to catharine's ears i had
better have slain a man were he the best in
perth and by hammer and nails i would have
done it on provocation rather than convoy this
baggage through the city
perhaps louise suspected the cause her
conductor's anxiety for she said timidly and
with hesitation worthy sir were it not better
i should stop one instant in that chapel
and don my mantle 
humph sweetheart well proposed said
the armourer hut the monk interfered raising
at the same time the finger interdiction
the chapel holy st maddox is no tiring
room for vile jugglers and strollers to shift
their trappings in i will presently show thee
a vestry more suited to thy condition
the poor young woman hung down her
humbled head and turned from the chapel
door which she had approached with the deep
sense selfabasement her little spaniel
seemed to gather from his mistress's looks and
manner that they were unauthorized intruders
on the holy ground which they trode and hung
his ears and swept the pavement with his tail
as he trotted slowly and close to louise's
heels
the monk moved on without a pause they
descended a broad flight steps and proceeded
through a labyrinth subterranean 

sages dimly lighted as they passed a lowarched
door the monk turned and said to
louise with the same stern voice as before 
there daughter folly there is a robingroom
where many before you have deposited
their vestments 
obeying the least signal with ready and timorous
acquiescence she pushed the door open
but instantly recoiled with terror it was a
charnelhouse half filled with dry skulls and
bones
i fear to change my dress there and alone
but if you father command it be it as you
will
m why thou child vanity the remains on
which thou loosest are but the earthly attire 
those who in their day led or followed in the
pursuit worldly pleasure and such shalt
thou be for all thy mincing and ambling thy
piping and thy harping thou and all such ministers
 frivolous and worldly pleasure must
become like these poor bones whom thy idle
nicety fears and loaths to look upon
 say not with idle nicety reverend father
answered the gleemaiden for heaven
knows i covet the repose these poor bleached
relics and if by stretching my body upon
them i could without sin bring my state to
theirs i would choose that charnel heap for my
place rest beyond the fairest and softest
couch in scotland
be patient and come on said the monk ina
milder tone the reaper must not leave the
harvestwork till the sunset gives the signal
they walked forward brother cyprian at
the a long gallery opened the door a
small apartment or perhaps a chapel for it was
decorated with a crucifix before which burned
four lamps all bent and crossed themselves 
and the priest said to the minstrel maiden pointing
to the crucifix what says that emblem 
that he invites the sinner as well as the
righteous to approach
ay if the sinner put from him his sin
said the monk whose tone voice was evidently
milder prepare thyself here for thy
journey
vol i v

louise remained an instant or two in the chapel
and presently reappeared in a mantle 
coarse grey cloth in which she had closely muffled
herself having put such her more gaudy
habiliments as she had time to take off in the
little basket which had before held her ordinary
attire
the monk presently afterwards unlocked a
door which led to the open air they found
themselves in the garden which surrounded the
monastery the dominicans the southern
gate is on the latch and through it you can pass
unnoticed said the monk bless thee my
son and bless thee too unhappy child remembering
where you put off your idle trinkets
may you take care how you again resume them 
alas father said louise if the poor
foreigner could supply the mere wants life
by any more creditable occupation she has
small wish to profess her idle art but 
but the monk had vanished nay the very
door through which she had just passed appeared
to have vanished also so curiously was it
concealed beneath a flying buttress and among
the profuse ornaments gothic architecture
here is a woman let out by this private postern
sure enough was henry's reflection
pray heaven the good fathers never let any
in the place seems convenient for such games
at bopeep but benedicite what is to be done
next i must get rid this quean as fast as 
can and i must see her safe for let her beat
heart what she may she looks too modest
now she is in decent dress to deserve the usage
which the wild scot galloway or the devil's
legion from the liddell are like to afford her
louise stood as if she waited his pleasure
which way to go her little dog relieved by
the exchange the dark subterranean vault for
the open air sprung in wild gambols through
the walks and jumped upon its mistress and
even though more timidly circled close round
the smith's feet to express its satisfaction to
him also and conciliate his favour
down chariot down said the gleemaiden
 you are glad to get into the blessed
sunshine but where shall we rest at night
my poor chariot 
and now mistress said the smith not
churlishly for it was not in his nature but
bluntly as one who is desirous to finish a disagreeable
employment which way lies your
road 
louise looked on the ground and was silent
on being again urged to say which way she desired
to be conducted she again looked down
and said she could not tell
come come said henry i understand
all that i have been agalliarda reveller in my
day but it's best to be plain as matters are
with me now i am an altered man for these
many many months and so my quean you
and i must part sooner than perhaps a light o
love such as you expected to part with a likely
young fellow
louise wept silently with her eyes still cast
on the ground as one who felt an insult which
she had not a right to complain at length
perceiving that her conductor was grown impatient
she faltered out noble sir 
sir is for a knight said the impatient
burgher and noble is for a baron i am harry
 the wynd an honest mechanic and free 
my guild
good craftsman then said the minstrel
woman you judge me harshly but not without
seeming cause i would relieve you immediately
 my company which it may be brings
little credit to good men did i but know which
way to go
to the next wake or fair to be sure said
henry roughly having no doubt that this distress
was affected for the purpose palming
herself upon him and perhaps dreading to
throw himself into the way temptation and
that is the feast st maddox at auchterarder
i warrant thou wilt find the way thither well
enough
after daughter repeated the glee maiden
her southern tongue in vain attempting the
celtic accentuation i am told my poor lays
will not be understood if i go nearer to yon
dreadful range mountains
 will you abide then in perth 
but where to lodge said the wanderer
why where lodged you last night replied
the smith you know where you came from
surely though you seem doubtful where you
are going 
i slept in the hospital the convent
but i was only admitted upon great importunity
and i was commanded not to return
nay they will never take you in with the
brand the douglas upon you that is even
too true but the prince mentioned sir john
ramorny's i can take you to his lodgings
through bystreets though it is short an
honest burgher's office and my time presses
i will go anywhere i know i am a scandal
and incumbrance there was a time when
it was otherwise but this ramorny who is
he 
a courtly knight who lives a jolly bachelor's
life and is master the horse and private
as they say to the young prince
what to the wild scornful young man who
gave occasion to yonder scandal oh take me
not thither good friend is there no christian
woman who would give a poor creature rest in
her cowhouse or barn for one night i will
be gone with early daybreak i will repay her
richly i have gold and i will repay you too
if and
say nothing what you have seen
m who i nay fear mc not pah i scorn
a talebearer
away with you then i hear the clash 
armour
this put life and mettle into the heels the
bonnetmaker who turning his back on the
supposed danger set off at a pace which the
smith never doubted would speedily bring him
to his own house
here is another chattering jay to deal
with thought the smith but i have a hank
over him too the minstrels have a fabliau 
a daw with borrowed feathers why this oliver
is the very bird and by st dunstan if he lets
his chattering tongue run on at my expense i
will so pluck him as never hawk plumed a partridge
and this he knows
as these reflections thronged on his mind
he had nearly reached the his journey
and with the gleemaiden still hanging on his
cloak exhausted partly with fear partly with
fatigue he at length arrived at the middle 
the wynd which was honoured with his own
habitation and from which in the uncertainty
that then attended the application surnames
he derived one his own appellatives
here on ordinary days his furnace was seen
to blaze and four half stripped knaves stunned
the neighbourhood with the clang hammer
and tithy but st valentine's holiday was an
excuse for these men steel having shut the
shop and for the present being absent on their
own errands devotion or pleasure the
house which adjoined to the smithy called henry
its owner and though it was small and
situated in a narrow street yet as there was
a large garden with fruit trees behind it it
constituted upon the whole a pleasant dwelling
the smith instead knocking or calling
which would have drawn neighbours to
doors and windows drew out a passkey his
own fabrication then a great and envied curiosity
and opening the door his house introduced
his companion into his habitation
the apartment which received henry and
the gleemaiden was the kitchen which served
amongst those the smith's station for the family
bittingroom although one or two individuals
like simon glover had an eatingroom
apart from that in which their victuals were
prepared in the corner this apartment
which was arranged with an unusual attention
to cleanliness sat an old woman whose neatness
 attire and the precision with which her
scarlet plaid was drawn over her head so as to
descend to her shoulders on each side might
have indicated a higher rank than that luckier
shoolbred the smith's housekeeper yet such
and no other was her designation and not
having attended mass in the morning she was
quietly reposing herself by the side the fire
her beads half told hanging over her left arm 
her prayers half said loitering upon her tongue 
her eyes half closed resigning themselves to
slumber while she expected the return her
fosterson without being able to guess at what
hour it was likely to happen she started up
at the sound his entrance and bent her eye
upon his companion at first with a look the
utmost surprise which gradually was exchanged
for one expressive great displeasure
now the saints bless mine eyesight henry
smith she exclaimed very devoutly
amen with all my heart get some food
ready presently good nurse for i fear me this
traveller hath dined but lightly
m and again i pray that our lady would
preserve my eyesight from the wicked delusions
 satan 
so be it i tell you good woman but what
is the use all this pattering and praying 
do you not hear me or will you not do as i
bid you 
it must be himself then whatever is it 
but oh it is more like the foul fiend in his
likeness to have such a baggage hanging upon
his cloak o harry smith men called you a
wild lad for less things but who would ever
have thought that harry would have brought a
light leman under the roof that sheltered his
worthy mother and where his own nurse has
dwelt for thirty years 
hold your peace old woman and be 
said the smith this gleewoman
is no leman mine nor tiny other person
that i know but she is going off for dundee
tomorrow by the boats and we must give
her quarters till then
quarters said the old woman you
may give quarters to such cattle if you like it
yourself harry wynd but the came house
shall not quarter that trumpery quean and me
and that you may assure yourself
your mother is angry with me said louise
misconstruing the connexion the parties
i will not remain to give her any offence if
there is a stable or a townhouse an empty stall
will be bed enough for chariot and me
ay ay i am thinking it is the quarters you
arc best used to said dame shoolbred
hark ye nurse shoolbred said the smith
you know i love you for your own sake and
lor my mothers but by st dunstan who was
a saint my own craft i will have the command
 my own house and if you leave me
without any better reason but your own nonsensical
suspicions you must think how you
will have the door open to you when you return
 for you shall have no help mine i promise
you
avveel my bairn and that will never make
me risk the honest name i have kept for sixty
years it was never your mother's custom and
it shall never be mine to take up with ranters
and jugglers and singing women and i am not
so far to seek for a dwelling that the same roof
should cover me and a tramping princess like
that
with this the refractory gouvernante began
in great hurry to adjust her tartan mantle forgoing
abroad by pulling it so far forwards as
to conceal the white linen cap the edges 
which bordered her shrivelled but still fresh
and healthful countenance this done she seized
upon a staff the trusty companion her
journeys and was fairly trudging towards the
door when the smith stepped between her and
the passage
wait at least old woman till we have
cleared scores i owe you for fee and bounties

an that's e'en a dream your own fool's
head what feo or bounties am i to take from
the son your mother that fed clad and
yielded me as if i had been a sister 
and well you repay it nurse leaving her
only child at his utmost need
this seemed to strike the obstinate old woman
with compunction she stopped and looked
at her master and the minstrel alternately then
shook her head and seemed about to resume her
motion towards the door
i only receive this poor wanderer under
my roof urged the smith to save her from
the prison and the scourge
and why should you save her said the
inexorable dame shoolbred i dare say she
has deserved them both as well as ever thief
deserved a hempen collar
u for aught i know she may or she may not
but she cannot deserve to be scourged to death
or imprisoned till she is starved to death and
that is the lot them that the black douglas
bears mal talent against
and you are going to thraw the black
douglas for the sake a glee woman twill
be the worst your feuds yet oh henry
gow there is as much iron in your head as
in your anvil 
i bave sometimes thought this myself mistress
shoolbred but if i do get a cut or two on
this new argument i wonder who is to cure
them if you run away from me like a scared
wildgoose ay and moreover who is to receive
my bonny bride that i hope to bring up the
wynd one these days 
ah harry harry said the old woman
shaking her head this is not the way to prepare
an honest man's house for a young bride
you should be guided by modesty and discretion
and not by chambering and wantonness

i tell you again this poor creature is nothing
to me i wish her only to be safely taken
care and i think the boldest bordering in
perth will respect the bar my door as much
as the gate carlisle castle i am going down
to sim glover's i may stay there all night for
the highland cub is run back to the hills like
a wolf whelp as he is and so there is a bed to
spare and father simon will make me welcome
to the use it you will remain with this
poor creature feed her and protect her during
the night and i will call on her before day and
thou mayst go with her to the boat thyself an
thou wilt and so thou wilt set the last eyes on
her at the same time i shall
there is some reason in that said dame
shoolbred though why you should put your
reputation in risk for a creature that would find
a lodging for a silver twopence and less matter
is a mystery to me
trust me with that old woman and be
kind to the girl
kinder than she deserves i warrant you 
and truly though i little like the company 
such cattle yet i think i am less like to take
harm from her than you unless she be a witch
indeed which may well come to be the case as
the devil is very powerful with all this wayfaring
clanjamfray
no more a witch than i am a warlock
said the honest smith a poor brokenhearted
thing that if she hath done evil has creed a
sore weird for it be kind to her and yon
my musical damsel i will call on you tomor
row morning and carry you to the waterside
this old woman will treat you kindly if you
say nothing to her but what becomes honest
cars
the poor minstrel had listened to this dialogue
without understanding more than its
general tendency for though she spoke english
well she had acquired the language in
england itself and the northern dialect was
then as now a broader and harsher character
she saw however that she was to remain
with the old lady and meekly folding her arms
on her bosom bent her head with humility she
next looked towards the smith with a strong expression
 thankfulness then raising her eyes to
heaven took his passive hand and seemed about
to kiss the sinewy fingers in token deep and
affectionate gratitude but dame shoolbred
did not give license to the stranger's mode 
expressing her feelings she thrust in between
them and pushing poor louise aside said
u no no i'll have none that work go into
the chimney nook mistress and when harry
smith's gone if you must have hands to kiss
you shall kiss mine as long as you like and
you harry away down to sim glover's for if
pretty mistress catharine hears the company
you have brought home she may chance to
like them as little as i do what's the matter
now is the man demented are you going
out without your buckler and the whole town
in misrule 
you are right dame said the armourer 
and throwing the buckler over his broad shoulders
he departed from his house without gilding
farther question
fend votive first

we must now leave the lower parties in ons
historical drama to attend to the incidents
which took place among those a higher rank
and greater importance
we pass from the hut an armourer to the
councilroom a monarch and resume our
story just when the tumult beneath being settled
the angry chieftains were summoned to
the royal presence they entered displeased
with and lowering upon each other each so exclusively
filled with his own fancied injuries as
to be equally unwilling and unable to attend to
reason or argument albany alone calm and
crafty seemed prepared to use their dissatisfaction
for his own purposes and turn each incident
as it should occur to the furtherance his
own indirect ends
the king's irresolution although it amounted
even to timidity did not prevent his assuming
the exterior appearance dignity becoming
his situation it was only when hard
pressed as in the preceding scene that he lost
his apparent composure in general he might
be driven from his purpose but seldom from
his dignity manner he received albany
douglas march and the prior those illassorted
members his motley council with a
mixture courtesy and dignity which reminded
each haughty peer that he stood in the presence
 his sovereign and compelled him todo
the beseeming reverence
hang received their salutations the king
motioned them to be seated and they were
obeying his commands when rothsay entered
he walked gracefully up to his father and
kneeling at his footstool requested his blessing
robert with a look in which fondness and sorrow
were ill disguised made an attempt to assume
a look reproof as he laid his hand on
the youth's head and said with a sigh god
bless thee my thoughtless boy and make thee a
wiser man in thy future years 
amen my dearest father i said rothsay
in a tone feeling such as his happier moments
often evinced he then kissed the royal hand
with the reverence a son and a subject and
instead taking a place at the council board
remained standing behind the king's chair in
such a position that he might when he chose
whisper into his father's ear
the king then made a sign to the prior 
st dominic to take his place at the table on
which there were writing materials which 
all the subjects present albany excepted the
churchman was alone able to use the king
then opened the purpose their meeting by
saying with much dignity
our business my lords respected these
iiuhiippy dissensions in the highlands which we
learn by our latest messengers are about to occasion
the waste and destruction the country
even within a few miles this our own court
but near as this trouble is our ill fate and the
instigation wicked men have raised up one
yet nearer by throwing strife and contention
among the citizens perth and those attendants
who follow your lordships and others our
knights and nobles i must first therefore
apply to yourselves my lords to know why our
court is disturbed by such unseemly contending
and by what means they ought to be repressed
 brother albany do you tell us first
your sentiments on this matter
sir our royal sovereign and brother said
uic duke being in attendance on your person
when the fray began i am not acquainted
with its origin
 and for me said the prince i heard no
worse warcry than a minstrel wench's ballad
and saw no more dangerous bolts flying than
hazel nuts
and i said the earl march could onl v
perceive that the stout citizens perth had iu
chase some knaves who had assumed the bloody
heart on their shoulders they ran too fast to
be actually the men the earl douglas
douglas understood the sneer but only replied
to it by one those withering looks with
which he was accustomed to intimate his mortal
resentment he spoke however with haughty
composure
my liege he said must course know
it is douglas who must answer to this heavy
charge for when was there strife or bloodshed
in scotland but there were foul tongues to asperse
a douglas or a douglas's man as having
given cause to them we have here goodly
witnesses i speak not my lord albany
who has only said that he was as well becomes
him by your grace's side and i say nothing
 my lord rothsay who as befits his rank
years and understanding was cracking nuts
with a strolling musician he smiles here
he may say his pleasure i shall not forget a
tie which he seems to have forgotten but here
is my lord march who saw my followers
flying before the clowns perth i can tell
that earl that the followers the bloody heart
advance or retreat when their chieftain commands
and the good scotland requires
and i can answer exclaimed the equally
proud earl march his blood rushing into
his face when the king interrupted him
 peace angry lords said the king and
remember in whose presence you stand and
you my lord douglas tell us if you can
the cause this mutiny and why your followers
whose general good services we are most
willing to acknowledge were thus active in
private brawl 
i obey my lord said douglas slightly
stooping a head that seldom bent i was
passing from my lodgings in the carthusian
convent through the high street perth
with a few my ordinary retinue when i beheld
some the baser sort crowding around
the cross against which there were nailed this
placard and that which accompanies it
he took from a pocket in the bosom his
buffcoat a human hand and a piece parchment
the king was shocked and agitated
read he said good father prior and
let that ghastly spectacle be removed
the prior read a placard to the following
purpose 
inasmuch as the house a citizen 
perth was assaulted last night being st valentine's
eve by a sort disorderly nightwalkers
belonging to some company the
strangers now resident in the fair city and
whereas this hand was struck from one the
lawless glimmers in the fray that ensued the
provost and magistrates have directed that it
should be nailed to the cross in scorn and
contempt those by whom such brawl was
occasioned and if any one knightly degree
shall say that this our act is wrongfully done
i patrick charteris kinfauns knight will
justify this cartel in knightly weapons within
the barrack or if any one meaner birth
shall deny what is here said he shall be met
with by a citizen the fair city perth according
to his degree and so god and st
john protect the fail city 
you will not wonder my lord resumed
douglas that when my almoner had read tome
the contents so insolent a scroll i caused
one my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful
to the chivalry and nobility scotland
whereupon it seems some these saucy burghers
took license to hoot and insult the hindmost
 my train who wheeled their horses on them
and would soon have settled the feud but for
my positive command that they should follow
me in as much peace as the rascally vulgar
would permit and thus they arrived here in
the guise flying men when with my command
to repel force by force they might have
set fire to the four corners this wretched
borough and stifled the insolent churls like
foxcubs in a burning brake furze
there was a silence when douglas had done
speaking until the duke rothsay answered
addressing his father 
since the earl douglas possesses the
power burning the town where your grace
holds your court so soon as the provost and
he differ about a night riot oi the terms a
cartel am sure we ought all to be thankful
that he has not the will to do so
 the duke rothsay said douglas who
seemed resolved to maintain command his
temper may have reason to thank heaven ina
more serious tone than he now uses that the
douglas is as true as he is powerful this is a
time when the subjects in all countries rise
against the law we have heard the insurgents
 the jacquerie in france and jack
straw and hob miller and parson ball
among the southron and we may be sure there
is fuel enough to catch such a flame were it
spreading to our frontiers when i see peasants
challenging noblemen and nailing the
hands the gentry to their city cross i will
not say i fear mutiny for that would be false
but i foresee and will stand well prepared
for it
and why does my lord douglas say answered
the earl march that this cartel
has been done by churls i see sir patrick
charteris name there and he i ween is no
ehurps blood the douglas himself since he
takes the matter so warmly might lift sir
patrick's gauntlet without soiling his honour

my lord march replied douglas
should speak but what he understands i
do no injustice to the descendant the red
rover when i say he is too slight to be weighed
with the douglas the heir thomas
randolph might have a better claim to be answered

and by ray honour it shall not miss for
want my asking the grace said the earl 
march pulling his glove off
stay my lord said the king do us not
so gross an injury as to bring your feud to
mortal defiance here but rather offer your ungloved
hand in kindness to the noble earl and
embrace in token your mutual fealty to the
crown scotland
not so my liege answered march your
majesty may command me to return my gauntlet
for that and all the armour it belongs to are
at your command while i continue to hold my
earldom the crown scotland but when i
clasp douglas it must be with a mailed baud
farewell my liege my counsels here avail not
and those others are so favourably received
that perhaps farther stay were unwholesome for
my safety may god keep your highness from
open enemies and treacherous friends i am
for my castle dunbar from whence i think
you will soon hear news farewell to you
my lords albany and douglas you are
playing a high game look you play it fairly 
farewell poor thoughtless prince who art
sporting like a fawn within spring a tiger 
farewell all george dunbar sees the evil
he cannot remedy adieu all
the king would have spoken but the accents
died on his tongue as he received from
albany a look cautioning him to forbear the
earl march left the apartment receiving
the mute salutations the members the
council whom he had severally addressed excepting
from douglas alone who returned to
his farewell speech a glance contemptuous
defiance
the recreant goes to betray us to the
southron he said his pride rests on his
possessing that seaworn hold which can admit
the english into lothian nay look not
alarmed my liege i will hold good what i say
nevertheless it is yet time speak bat the
word my liege say but arrest him and
march shall not yet cross the earn on his traitorous
journey
nay gallant earl said albany who wished
rather that the two powerful lords should
counterbalance each other than that one should
obtain a decisive superiority that were too
hasty counsel the earl march came hither
on the king's warrant safeconduct and it
may not consist with my royal brother's honour
to break it yet if your lordship can bring
any detailed proof 
here they were interrupted by a flourish 
trumpets
 his grace albany is unwontedly scrupulous
today said douglas but it skills
not wasting words the time is past these are
march's trumpets and i warrant me he rides
at flight speed so soon as he passes the south
port we shall hear him in time and if it
be as i have conjectured he shall be met with
though all england backed his treachery
nay let us hope better the noble earl
 march said the king no way displeased
that the quarrel betwixt march and douglas
had seemed to obliterate the traces the disagreement
betwixt rothsay and his fatherinlaw
 he hath a fiery but not a sullen temper
in some things he has been i will not say
wronged but disappointed and something is
to be allowed to the resentment high blood
armed with great power but thank heaven all
 us who remain are one sentiment and 
one house so that at least our councils cannot
now be thwarted with disunion father prior
i pray you take your writing materials for you
must as usual be our clerk council and
now to business my lords and our first object
 consideration must be this highland
cumber
between the clan chateau and the clan
quhele or kay said the prior which as
our last advices from our brethren at ducked
inform us is ready to break out into a more formidable
warfare than has yet taken place between
these sons belial who speak noli

thing else than utterly destroying one another
their forces are assembling on each
side and not a man claiming in the tenth degree
 kindred but must repair to the brateach
 his tribe or stand to the punishment
 fire and sword the fiery cross hath fled like
a meteor in every direction and awakened
strange and unknown tribes beyond the distant
murray firth may heaven and st dominic be
our protection but if your lordships cannot
find remedy for evil it will spread broad and
wide and the patrimony the church must
in every direction be exposed to the fury 
these amalekite with whom there is as little
devotion to heaven as there is pity or love to
their neighbours may our lady be our guard 
we hear some them are yet utter heathens
and worship mahound and termagant
 my lords and kinsmen said robert ye 
have heard the urgency this case and may
standard literally cloth the lowland language still
retains the word irate which however is only applicable to a
child's pinafore or a coarse towel to such mean offices nine
words descend
desire to know my sentiments before you deliver
what your own wisdom shall suggest and in
sooth no better remedy occurs to me than to
send two commissioners with full power from
us to settle such debates as be among them 
and at the same time to charge them as they
shall be answerable to the law to lay down their
arms and forbear all practices violence against
each other
i approve your grace's proposal said
rothsay and i trust the good prior will not
refuse the venerable station envoy upon this
peacemaking errand and his reverend brother
the abbot the carthusian convent must
contend for an honour which will certainly add
two most eminent recruits to the large army 
martyrs since the highlanders little regard the
distinction betwixt clerk and layman in the
ambassadors whom you send to them
my royal lord rothsay said the prior
if i am destined to the blessed crown mart
jadom i shall be doubtless directed to the path
y which i am tn attain it meantime if you
vot it r
speak in jest may heaven pardon you and give
you light to perceive that it were better buckle
on your arms to guard the possessions the
church so perilously endangered than to employ
your wit in taunting her ministers and
servants
i taunt no one father prior said the
youth yawning nor have i much objection
to taking arms excepting that they are a somewhat
cumbrous garb and in february a furred
mantle is more suiting the weather than a
steel corslet and it irks me the more to put
on cold harness in this nipping weather that
would but the church send a detachment 
their saints and they have some highland
ones well known in this district and doubtless
used to the climate they might fight their
own battles like merry st george england
but i know not how it is we hear their
miracles when they are propitiated and their
vengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimonies
and these are urged as reasons for extending
their lands by large largesses and yet
if there come down but a band twenty highlanders
bell and candle make no speed
and the belted baron must be fain to maintain
the church in possession the lands which he
has given to her as much as if he himself still
enjoyed the fruits them
son robert said his father jou give
an undue license to your tongue
nay sir i am mute replied the prince
i had no purpose to disturb your highness
or displease the father prior who with so
many miracles at his disposal will not face as
it seems a handful highland catherine
we know said the prior with suppressed
indignation from what source these vile
doctrines are derived which we hear with horror
from the tongue your highness when
princes converse with heretics their minds and
manners are alike corrupted they show themselves
in the streets as the companions masters
and harlots and in the council as the scorners
 the church and holy things
peace good father said the king
 rothsav shall make amends for what he has
idly spoken alas let us take counsel in friendly
fashion rather than resemble a mutinous
crew mariners in a sinking vessel when
each is more intent on quarrelling with his
neighbours than in assisting the exertions 
the forlorn master for the safety the ship 
my lord douglas your house has been seldom
to lack when the crown scotland desired
either wise counsel or manly achievement 
i trust you will help us in this strait 
i can only wonder that the strait should
exist my lord answered the haughty douglas
 when i was intrusted with the lieutenancy
 the kingdom there were some 
these wild clans came down from the grampian
i troubled not the council about the
matter but made the sheriff lord ruthven
get to horse with the forces the carse the
hays the lindsay the oxides and other
gentlemen by st bride when it was steel
coat to frieze mantle the thieves knew what
lances were good for and whether swords had
edges or no there were some three hundred
 their best bonnets besides that their chief
donald cognac left on the moor thorn
and in rochinroy wood j and as many were
gibbeted at ploughman stairs which has still
the name from the hangman work that was don
there this is the way men deal with thieves
in my country and if gentler methods will succeed
better with these parish knaves do not
blame douglas for speaking his mind you
smile my lord rothsay may i ask how i
have a seconc time become your jest before i
have replied to the first which you passed on
me 
nay be not wrathful my good lord 
douglas answered the prince i did but
smile to think how your princely retinue would
dwindle if every thief were dealt with as the
poor highlanders at ploughman stairs
the king again interfered to prevent the earl
from giving an angry reply your lordship
said he to douglas advises wisely that we
should trust to arms when these men come out
against our subjects on the fair and level plain 
 some authorities place this skirmish so late as 
but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorders
while they continue to lurk within their
mountains i need not tell you that the clan
ciiattan and the clan kay are great confederacies
consisting each various tribes who arc
banded together each to support their own separate
league and who late have had dissensions
which have drawn blood wherever they
have met whether individually or in bands
the whole country is torn to pieces by their
restless feuds
i cannot see the evil this said the
douglas the ruffians will destroy each other
and the deer the highlands will increase as
the men diminish we shall gain as hunters
the exercise we lose as warriors
rather say that the wolves will increase as
the men diminish replied the king
i am content said douglas better
wild wolves than wild highlanders let there
be strong forces maintained along the highland
frontier to separate the quiet from the disturbed
country confine the fire civil war within
the highlands let it spend its uncontrolled
fury and it will be soon burnt out for want 
fuel the survivors will be humbled and will
be more obedient to a whisper your grace's
pleasure than their fathers or the knaves that
now exist have been to your strictest commands

this is wise but ungodly counsel said the
prior shaking his head i cannot take it upon
my conscience to recommend it it is wisdom
but it is the wisdom achitophel crafty at
once and cruel
my heart tells me so said robert laying
his hand on his breast my heart tells me
that it will be asked me at the awful day
robert stewart where are the subjects i have
given thee it tells me that i must account for
them all saxon and gael lowland highland
and border man that i will not be required to
answer for those alone who have wealth and
knowledge but for those also who were robbers
because they were poor and rebels because they
were ignorant
you highness speaks like a christian
king said the prior but you bear the
sword his well as the sceptre and this present
evil is a kind which the sword must cure
 hark ye my lords said the prince
looking up as if a gay thought had suddenly
struck him suppose we teach these savage
mountaineers a strain chivalry it were no
hard matter to bring these two great commanders
the captain the clan chateau and
the chief the no less doughty race the
clan quhele to defy each other to mortal combat
they might fight here in perth we
would lend them horse and armour thus their
fend would be stanched by the death one or
probably both the villains for i think both
avould break their necks in the first charge
my father's godly desire saving blood would
be attained and we should have the pleasure
 seeing such a combat between two salvage
knights for the first time in their lives wearing
breeches and mounted on horses as has
not been heard since the days king 

shame upon yon son robert said the
kiig do you make the distress your butime
country and the perplexity our councils
a subject for buffoonery 
 if you will pardon me royal brother said
albany i think that though my princely
nephew hath started this thought in a jocular
manner there may be something wrought out
 it which might greatly remedy this pressing
evil
good brother replied the king it is
unkind to expose rothsay's folly by pressing
further his illtimed jest we know the highland
clans have not our customs chivalry
nor the habit or mode doing battle which these
require
true royal brother answered albany 
yet i speak not in scorn but in serious earnest
true the mountaineers have not our forms and
mode doing battle in the lists but they have
those which are as effectual to the destruction 
human life and so that the mortal game is played
and the stake won and lost what signifies it
whether these gael fight with sword and lance
as becomes belted knights or with sandbags
like the restless churls england or butcher

each other with knives and skeans in their own
barbarous fashion their habits like our own
refer all disputed rights and claims to the decision
 battle they are as vain too as they
are fierce and the idea that these two clans
would be admitted to combat in presence your
grace and your court will readily induce
them to refer their difference to the fate battle
even were such rough arbitrement less familiar
to their customs and that in any such
numbers as shall be thought most convenient
we must take care that they approach not the
court save in such a fashion and number that
they shall not be able to surprise us and that
point being provided against the more that shall
be admitted to combat upon either side the
greater will be the slaughter among their bravest
and most stirring men and the more the
chance the highlands being quiet for sometime
to come
this were a bloody policy brother said
the king and again i say that i cannot bring
my conscience to countenance the slaughter 
these rude men that are so little better than so
many benighted heathens
 and are their lives more precious asked
albany than those nobles and gentlemen
who by your grace's license are so frequently
admitted to fight in barrack either for the satisfying
 disputes at law or simply to acquire
honour 
the king thus hard pressed had little to say
against a custom so engrafted upon the laws 
the realm and the usages chivalry as the trial
by combat and he only replied god knows
i have never granted such license as you urge
we with unless with the greatest repugnance 
and that i never saw men have strife together
to the effusion blood but i could have wished
to appease it with the shedding my
own
but my gracious lord said the prior it
seems that if we follow not some such policy as
this my lord albany we must have recourse
to that the douglas and at the risk
 the dubious event battle and with the
certainty losing many excellent subjects do
by means the lowland swords that which
these wild mountaineers will otherwise perform
with their owu hand what says my lord 
douglas to the policy his grace albany 
douglas said the haughty lord never
counselled that to be done by policy which
might be attained by open force he remains
by his opinion and is willing to march at the
head his own followers with those the
barons perthshire and the carse and either
bring these highlanders to reason or subjection
or leave the body a douglas among their savage
wildernesses
it is nobly said my lord douglas said
albany and well might the king rely upon
thy undaunted heart and the courage thy
resolute followers but see you not how soon
you may be called elsewhere where your presence
and services are altogether indispensable
to scotland and her monarch marked you
not the gloomy tone in which the fiery earl 
march limited his allegiance and faith to our
sovereign here present to that space for which
he was to remain king robert's vassal and
did not you yourself suspect that he was plotting
a transference his allegiance to england
 other chiefs subordinate power and
inferior fame may do battle with the highlanders
 but if march admit the perches and
their englishmen into our frontiers who will
drive them back if the douglas be elsewhere 
my sword answered douglas is equally
at the service his majesty on the frontier
or in the deepest recesses the highlands
i have seen the backs the proud percy and
george dunbar ere now and i may see them
again and if it is the king's pleasure i should
take measures against this probable conjunction
 stranger and traitor i admit that rather than
trust to an inferior or feebler hand the important
task settling the highlands i would be disposed
to give my opinion in favour the policy
 my lord albany and suffer those savages
to carve each other's limbs without giving
barons and knights the trouble hunting
them down
my lord douglas said the prince
who seemed determined to omit no opportunity
to gall his haughty fatherinlaw does not
choose to leave to us lowlanders even the poor
crumbs honour which might be gathered at
the expense the highland kerne while he
with his border chivalry reaps the full harvest
 victory over the english but percy hath
seen men's backs as well as douglas and i
have known as great wonders as that he who
goes forth to seek such wool should come back
shorn
a phrase said douglas well becoming
a prince who speaks honour with a wandering
harlot's scrip in his bonnet by way favour

excuse it my lord said rothsay men
who have fetched unwittingly become careless
in the choice those whom they love par
amours the chained dog must snatch at the
nearest bone
rothsay my unhappy son exclaimed the
king art thou mad or wouldst thou draw
down on thee the full storm a king and father's
displeasure 
 i am dumb returned the prince at your
grace's command
 well then my lord albany said the
king since such is your advice and since
scottish blood must flow how i pray you are
we to prevail on these fierce men to refer their
quarrel to such a combat as you propose 
that my liege said albany 
your words seem to aim at some one in this
presence father prior said the douglas if
at me they do me foul wrong i am well aware
that the abbot aberbrothick hath made
some illadvised complaints that i suffered not
his beeves to become too many for his pastures
or his stock grain to burst the girls
 the monastery while my followers lacked
beef and their horses corn but bethink you
the pastures and cornfields which produced that
plenty were bestowed by my ancestors on the
house aberbrothick surely not with the purpose
that their descendant should starve in the
midst it and neither will he by st bride 
but for heresy and false doctrine he added
striking his large hand heavily on the counciltable
 who is it that dare tax the douglas i
would not have poor men burned for silly
thoughts but my hand and sword are ever ready
to maintain the christian faith
my lord i doubt it not said the prior so
hath il ever been with your most noble house
m
fot the ablots complaints they may pass to
a second day but what we now desire is a
commission to some noble lord state joined
to others holy church to support by strength
 hand if necessary the inquiries which the
reverend official the bounds and other grave
prelates my unworthy self being one are about
to make into the cause the new doctrines
which are now deluding the simple and depraving
the pure and precious faith approved
by the holy father and his reverend predecessors

 let the earl douglas have a royal commission
to this effect said albany and let
there be no exception whatever from his jurisdiction
saving the royal person for my own
part although conscious that i have neither in
act nor thought received or encouraged a doctrine
which holy church hath not sanctioned
yet i should blush to claim an immunity under
the blood royal scotland lest i should seem
to be seeking refuge against a crime so horrible

i will have nought to do with it said
douglas to march against the english and
the southron traitor march is task enough forme
moreover i am a true scotsman and
will not give way to aught that may put the
church scotland's head farther into the roman
yoke or make the barons coronet stoop to
the mitre and cowl do thou therefore most
noble duke albany place your own name
in the commission and i pray your grace so
to mitigate the zeal the men holy church
who may be associated with you that there be
no over zealous dealings for the smell a
faggot on the tay would bring back the douglas
from the walls york
the duke hastened to give the earl assurance
that the commission should be exercised with
lenity and moderation
ff without a question said king robert
the commission must be ample and did it
consist with the dignity our crown we would
not ourselves decline its jurisdiction but we
trust that while the thunders the church
are directed against the vile authors these
detestable heresies there shall bs measures 
mildness and compassion taken with the unfortunate
victims their delusions riajnoci m
such is ever the course holy church
my lord said the prior st dominic's
 why then let the commission be expedited
with due care in name our brother
albany and such others as shall be deemed convenient
said the king and now once again
let us break up our council and rothsay como
thou with me and lend me thine arm i have
matter for thy private earciooasb ad ybtndm
ho la exclaimed the prince in the tone
in which he would have addressed a managed
horse
om trim iins
wod utuimoq slt
yo more fear than danger i fancy answered
the prince but how can i tell the men who
made this nocturnal disturbance 
there was a follower thine own there
continued the king a man belhal whom
i will have brought to condign punishment
i have no follower to my knowledge capable
 deserving your highnesses displeasure
answered the prince
 i will have no evasions boy where wert
thou on st valentine's eve n x
it is to be hoped that i was serving the
good saint as a man mould might answered
the young man carelessly
 will my royal nephew tell us how his master
 the horse was employed upon that holy
eve said the duke albania 
speak robert i command thee to speak
said the king as ai bodes o
ramorny was employed in my service i
think that answer may satisfy my uncle
 but it will not satisfy wie said the angry
father god knows i never coveted man's
blood but that ramorny's head i will have if
law can give it he has been the encourager
and partaker all thy numerous vices and follies
i will take care he shall be so no more 
call maclouis with a guard 
 do not injure an innocent man interposed
the prince desirous at every sacrifice to preserve
his favourite from the menaced danger 
i pledge my word that ramorny was employed
in business mine therefore could not
be engaged in this brawl
ff false equivocator that thou art said the
king presenting to the prince a ring behold
the signet ramorny lost in the infamous affray
 it fell into the hands a follower the
douglas and was given by the earl to my brother
speak not for ramorny for he dies and
go thou from my presence and repent the flava

nitrous councils which could make thee stand
before me with a falsehood in thy mouth oh
shame robin shame as a son thou hast lied
to thy father as a knight to the head thy
order
the prince stood before his father mute 
and selfconvicted he then gave
way to the honourable feelings which at bottom
he really possessed and threw himself at his
father's feet
the false knight he said deserves degradation
the disloyal subject death but oh 
let the son crave from the father pardon for the
servant who did not lead him into guilt but who
reluctantly plunged himself into it at his command
 let me bear the weight my own folly
but spare those who have been my tools
rather than my accomplices remember ramorn
was preferred to my service by my sainted
mother
name her not robin i charge thee said
the king she is happy that she never saw
the child her love stand before her doubly
dishonoured by guilt and by falsehood
 am indeed unworthy to name ber said
the prince and yet my dear father in her
name i must petition for ramorny's life
 if i might offer my counsel said the duke
 albany who saw that a reconciliation would
soon take place betwixt the father and son i
would advise that ramorny be dismissed from
the prince's household and society with such
further penalty as his imprudence may seem to
merit the public will be contented with his
disgrace and the matter will be easily accommodated
or stifled so that his highness do not
attempt to screen his servant
wilt thou for my sake robin said the
king with a faltering voice and the tear in
his eye dismiss this dangerous man for my
sake who could not refuse thee the heart out
 my bosom 
it shall be done my father done instantly
the prince replied and seizing the pen he
wrote a hasty dismissal ramorny from his
service and put it into albany's hands i
would i could fulfil all your wishes as easily
my royal father he added throwing himself at
n
the king's feet who raised him up and fondly
folded him in his arms
albany scowled but was silent and it was
not till after the space a minute or two that
he said this matter being so happily accommodated
let me ask if your majesty is pleased
to attend the evensong service in the chapel
r
ij
surely said the king have i not
thanks to pay to god who has restored union
to my family you will go with us brother 
so please your grace to give me leave 
absence no said the duke i must concert
with the douglas and others the manner in
which we may bring these highland vultures
to our lure r r r 
albany retired to think over his ambitious
projects while the father and son attended divine
service to thank god for their happy reconciliation

chapter 
a former chapter opened in the royal confessional
 we are now to introduce our readers
to a situation somewhat similar though the
scene and persons were very different instead
 a gothic and darkened apartment in a monastery
one the most beautiful prospects in
scotland lay extended beneath the hill kinsoul
and at the foot a rock which commanded
the view in every direction sat the
fair maid perth listening in an attitude 
devout attention to the instructions a carthusian
monk in his white gown and scapular
who concluded his discourse with prayer
in which his proselyte devoutly joined
when they had finished their devotions the
priest sat for some time with his eyes fixed on
the glorious prospect which even the early
and chilly season could not conceal the beauties
and it was some time ere he addressed his
attentive companion
when i behold he said at length this
rich and varied land with its castles churches
convents stately palaces and fertile fields these
extensive woods and that noble river i know
not my daughter whether most to admire the
bounty god or the ingratitude man he
hath given us the beauty and fertility the
earth and we have made the scene his bounty
a charnelhouse and a battlefield he hath
given us power over the elements and skill to
erect houses for comfort and defence and we
have converted them into dens for robbers and
ruffians
yet surely my father there is room for
comfort replied catharine even in the very
prospect we look upon yonder four goodly
convents with their churches and their towers
which tell the citizens with brazen voice that
they should think on their religious duties 
their inhabitants who have separated themselves
from the world its pursuits and its pleasures
to dedicate themselves to the service 
heaven all bear witness that if scotland bea
bloody and a sinful land she is yet alive and
sensible to the claims which religion demands
 the human race
verily daughter what you say seems truth 
and yet nearly viewed too much the comfort
you describe will be found delusive it is true
there was a period in the christian world when
good men maintaining themselves by the work
 their hands assembled together not that
they might live easily or sleep softly but that
they might strengthen each other in the christian
faith and qualify themselves to be teachers
 the word to the people doubtless there
are still such to be found in the holy edifices on
which we now look but it is to be feared
that the love many has waxed cold our
churchmen have become wealthy as well by
the gifts pious persons as by the bribes
which wicked men have given in their ignorance
imagining that they can purchase that
pardon for endowments to the church which
heaven has only offered to sincere penitents
and thus as the church waxeth rich her doc i
trines have unhappily become dim and obscure
as a light is less seen if placed in a lamp 
chased gold than beheld through a screen 
glass god knows if i see these things and
mark them it is from no wish singularity or
desire to make myself a teacher in israel but
because the fire burns in my bosom and will
not permit me to be silent i obey the rules 
my order and withdraw not myself from its
austerities be they essential to our salvation
or be they mere formalities adopted to supply
the want real penitence and sincere devotion
i have promised nay vowed to observe them 
and they shall be respected by me the more
that otherwise i might be charged with regarding
my bodily ease when heaven is my witness
how lightly i value what i may be called on to
volet d
act or suffer if the purity the church could
be restored or the discipline the priesthood
replaced in its primitive simplicity
but my father said catharine even
for these opinions men term you a lollard and
a wickliffe and say it is your desire to destroy
churches and cloisters and restore the
religion heathenism
even so my daughter am i driven to seek
refuge in hills and rocks and must be presently
contented to take my flight amongst the
rude highlanders who are thus far in a more
gracious state than those i leave behind me
that theirs are crimes ignorance not 
presumption i will not omit to take such
means safety and escape from their cruelty
as heaven may open to me for while such appear
i shall account it a sign that i have still
a service to accomplish but when it is my
master's pleasure he knows how willingly
clement blair will lay down a vilified life upon
earth in humble hope a blessed exchange
hereafter but wherefore dost thou look northward
so anxiously my child thy young eyes
are quicker than mine dost thou see any one
coming 
i look father for the highland youth conachar
who will be thy guide to the hills where
his father can afford thee a safe if a rude retreat
this he has often promised when we
spoke you and your lessons i fear he is
now in company where he will soon forget
them
 the youth hath sparkles grace in him
said father clement although those his
race are usually too much devoted to their own
fierce and savage customs to endure with patience
either the restraints religion or those
 the social law thou hast never told me
daughter how contrary to all the usages either
 the burgh or the mountains this youth
came to reside in thy father's house 
all i know touching that matter said
catharine is that his father is a man consequence
among those hill men and that he desired
as a favour my father who hath had
wwivrsry 

dealings with them in the way his merchandise
to keep this youth for a certain time and
that two days since they parted as he was to
return home to his own mountains
and why has my daughter demanded the
priest maintained such a correspondence with
this highland youth that she should know how
to send for him when she desired to use his
services in my behalf surely this is much
influence for a maiden to possess over such
a wild colt as this youthful mountaineer
catharine blushed and answered with hesitation
 if i have had any influence with concha
heaven be my witness i have only exerted
it to enforce upon his fiery temper compliance
with the rules civil life it is true i have
long expected that you my father would be
obliged to take to flight and i therefore had
agreed with him that he should meet me at this
place as soon as he should receive a message
from me with a token which i yesterday dispatched
the messenger was a lightfooted
boy his own clan whom he used sometimes
to send on errands into the highlands
and am i then to understand daughter
that this youth so fair to the eye was nothing
more dear to you than as you desired to enlighten
his mind and reform his manners 
it is so my father and no otherwise answered
catharine and perhaps i did not do
well to hold intimacy with him even for his
instruction and improvement but my discourse
never led farther
then have i been mistaken my daughter 
for i thought i had seen in thee late some
change purpose and some wishful regards
looking back to this world which you were
at one time resolved to take leave
catharine hung down her head and blushed
more deeply than ever as she said yourself
father were used to remonstrate against
my taking the veil
nor do i now approve it my child said
the priest marriage is an honourable state
appointed by heaven as the regular means 
continuing the race man and i read not in the
scriptures what human inventions have since
affirmed concerning the superior excellence 
a state celibacy but i am jealous thee
my child as a father is his only daughter lest
thou shouldst throw thyself away upon someone
unworthy thee thy parent i know less
nice in thy behalf than i am countenances the
addresses that fierce and riotous reveller
whom they call henry the wynd he is
rich it may be but a haunter idle and debauched
company a common prizefighter
who has shed human blood like water can
such a one be a fit mate for catharine glover
 and yet report says they are soon to be
united
the fair maid perth's complexion changed
from red to pale and from pale to red as she
hastily replied i think not him though
it is true some courtesies have passed betwixt
us late both as he is my father's friend and
as being according to the custom the time
my valentine
your valentine my child said father
clement and can your modesty and prudence
have trifled so much with the delicacy 
your sex as to place yourself in such a relation
to such a man as this artificer think you
that this valentine a godly saint and christian
bishop as he is said to have been ever countenanced
a silly and unseemly custom more likely
to have originated in the heathen worship 
flora or venus when mortals gave the names
 deities to their passions and studied to excite
instead restraining them 
father said catharine in a tone more
displeasure than she had ever before assumed
to the carthusian i know not upon what
ground you tax me thus severely for complying
with a general practice authorized by universal
custom and sanctioned by my father's authority
i cannot feel it kind that you put such
misconstruction upon me
forgive me daughter answered the priest
mildly if i have given you offence but this
henry smith is a forward licentious man to
whom you cannot allow any uncommon degree
 intimacy and encouragement without exposing
yourself to worse misconstruction unless
indeed it be your purpose to wed him and
that very shortly
 say no more it my father said catharine
 you give me more pain than you would
desire to do and i may be provoked to answer
otherwise than as becomes me perhaps i have
already had cause enough to make me repent my
compliance with an idle custom at any rate
believe that henry smith is nothing to me and
that even the idle intercourse arising from st
valentine's day is utterly broken off
 i am rejoiced to hear it my daughter replied
the carthusian and must now prove
you on another subject which renders me most
anxious on your behalf you cannot yourself be
ignorant it although i could wish it were not
necessary to speak a thing so dangerous even
before these surrounding rocks cliffs and
stones but it must be said catharine you
have a lover in the highest rank scotland's
sons honour 
i know it father answered catharine
composedly i would it were not so
so would i also said the priest did i
see in my daughter only the child folly
which most young women are at her age especially
if possessed the fatal gift beauty
but as thy charms to speak the language an
idle world have attached to thee a lover such
high rank so i know that thy virtue and wisdom
will maintain the influence over the prince's
mind which thy beauty hath acquired
father replied catharine the prince is
a licentious gallant whose notice me tends
only to my disgrace and ruin can you who
seemed but now afraid that i acted imprudently
in entering into an ordinary exchange courtesies
with one my own rank speak with patience
 the sort correspondence which the
heir scotland dares to fix upon me know
that it is but two nights since he with a party
 his debauched followers would have carried
me by force from my father's house had i not
been rescued by that same rash spirited henry
smith who if he be too hasty in venturing on
danger on slight occasion is always ready to
venture his life in behalf innocence or in resistance
 oppression it is well my part to do
him that justice
 i should know something that matter
said the monk since it was my voice that sent
him to your assistance i had seen the party as
i passed your door and was hastening to the
civil power in order to raise assistance when i
perceived a man's figure coming slowly towards
me apprehensive it might he one the ambuscade
i stepped behind the buttresses the
chapel st john and seeing from a nearer
view that it was henry smith i guessed
which way he was bound and raised my voice
in an exhortation which made him double his
speed
i am beholden to you father said catharine
 but all this and the duke rothsay's
own language to me only show that the prince
is a profligate young man who will scruple no
extremities which may promise to gratify an idle
passion at whatever expense to its object his
emissary ramorny has even had the insolence
to tell me that my father shall suffer for it if i
dare to prefer being the wife an honest man
to becoming the loose paramour a married
prince so t see no other remedy than to take
the veil or run the risk my own ruin and
my poor father's were there no other reason
the terror these threats from a man so notoriously
capable keeping his word ought as
much to prevent my becoming the bride any
worthy man as it should prohibit me from unlatching
his door to admit murderers oh
good father what a lot is mine and how
fatal am i likely to prove to my affectionate parent
and to any one with whom i might ally
my unhappy fortunes 
be yet good cheer my daughter said
the monk there is comfort for thee even in
this extremity apparent distress ramorny is
a villain and abuses the ear his patron the
prince is unhappily a dissipated and idle youth 
but unless my grey hairs have been strangely
imposed on his character is beginning to alter
he hath been awakened to ramorny's baseness
and deeply regrets having followed his evil
advice i believe nay i am well convinced
that his passion for you has assumed a nobler
and purer character and that the lessons he has
heard from me on the corruptions the church
and the times will if enforced from your
lips sink deeply into his heart and perhaps
produce fruits for the world to wonder as
well as rejoice at old prophecies have said
that rome shall fall by the speech a woman

these are dreams father said catharine
 the visions one whose thoughts are
too much on better things to admit his thinking
justly upon the ordinary affairs earth
when we have looked long at the sun everything
else can only be seen indistinctly
thou art over hasty my daughter said
clement and thou shalt be convinced it
the prospects which i am to open to thee were
unfit to be exposed to one a less firm sense
 virtue or a more ambitious temper perhaps
it is not fit that even to you i should
display them but my confidence is strong in thy
wisdom and thy principles know then that
there is much chance that the church rome
will dissolve the union which she has herself
formed and release the duke rothsay from
his marriage with marjory douglas
here he paused
and if the church hath power and will todo
this replied the maiden what influence
can the divorce the duke from his wife produce
on the fortunes catharine glover 
she looked at the priest anxiously as she
spoke and he had some apparent difficulty in
framing his reply for he looked on the ground
while he answered her
what did beauty do for catharine logic 
unless our fathers told us falsely it raised her
to share the throne david bruce
did she live happy or die regretted good
father asked catharine in the same calm
and steady tone
she formed her alliance from temporal
and perhaps criminal ambition replied father
clement and she found her reward in vanity
and vexation spirit but had she wedded
with the purpose that the believing wife should
convert the unbelieving or confirm the doubting
husband what then had been her reward
love and honour upon earth and an
inheritance in heaven with queen margaret
and those heroines who have been the nursing
mothers the church
hitherto catharine had sat upon a stone beside
the priest's feet and looked up to him as
she spoke or listened but now as if animated
by calm yet settled feelings disapprobation
she rose up and extending her hand towards
the monk as she spoke addressed him with
a countenance and voice which might have become
a cherub pitying and even as much as
possible sparing the feelings the mortal
whose errors he is commissioned to rebuke
and is it even so she said and canso
much the wishes hopes and prejudices 
this vile world affect him who may be called
tomorrow to lay down his life for opposing the
corruptions a wicked age and backsliding
priesthood can it be the severely virtuous
father clement who advises his child to aim
at or even to think the possession a
throne and a bed which cannot become vacant
but by an act crying injustice to the present
possessor can it be the wise reformer the
s
church who wishes to rest a scheme in itself so
unjust upon a foundation so precarious since
when is it good father that the principal
libertine has altered his morals so much to be
likely to court in honourable fashion the daughter
 a perth artizan two days must have
wrought this change for only that space has
passed since he was breaking into my father's
house at midnight with worse mischief in his
mind than that a common robber and think
you that if rothsay's heart could dictate so
mean a match he could achieve such a purpose
without endangering both his succession and
his life assailed by the douglas and march at
the same time for what they must receive as
an act injury and insult to both their houses 
oh father clement where was your principle
where your prudence when they suffered you
to be bewildered by so strange a dream and
placed the meanest your disciples in the
right thus to reproach you 
the old man's eyes filled with tears as catharine
visibly and painfully affected by what
she had said was at length silent

by the mouths babes and sucklings
he said hath he rebuked those who would
seem wise in their generation i thank heaven
that hath taught me better thoughts than
my own vanity suggested through the medium
 so kind a monitress yes catharine i must
not hereafter wonder or exclaim when i see
those whom i have hitherto judged too harshly
struggling for temporal power and holding
all the while the language religious zeal i
thank thee daughter for thy salutary admonition
and i thank heaven that sent it by thy
lips rather than those a sterner reprover
catharine had raised her head to reply and
bid the old man whose humiliation gave her
pain be comforted when her eyes were arrested
by an object close at hand among the crags
and cliffs which surrounded this place seclusion
there were two which stood in such close
contiguity that they seemed to have been portions
 the same rock which rended by lightning
or by an earthquake now exhibited a
chasm about four feet in breadth betwixt

the masses stone into this chasm an oak
tree had thrust itself in one the fantastic
frolics which vegetation often exhibits in such
situations the tree stunted and illfed had
sent its roots along the face the rock in all
directions to seek for supplies and they lay
like military lines communication contorted
twisted and knotted like the immense
snakes the indian archipelago as catharine's
look fell upon the curious complication
 knotty branches and twisted roots she was
suddenly sensible that two large eyes were visible
among them fixed and glaring at her like
those a wild animal in ambush she started
and without speaking pointed out the object
to her companion and looking herself with
more strict attention could at length trace out
the bushy red hair and shaggy beard which
had hitherto been concealed by the drooping
branches and contorted roots the tree
when he saw himself discovered the highlander
for such he proved stepped forth from
his lurkingplace and stalking forward disvol
 e
m
played a colossal person clothed in a purple red
and greenchecked plaid under which he wore
a jacket bull's hide his bow and arrows were
at his back his head was bare and a large quantity
 tangled locks like the gibbs the irish
served to cover the head and supplied all the
purposes a bonnet his belt bore a sword
and dagger and he had in his hand a danish
poleaxe more recently called a lochaber axe
through the same rude portal advanced one
by one four men more similar size and
dressed and armed in the same manner
catharine was too much accustomed to the
appearance the inhabitants the mountains
so near to perth to permit herself to be alarmed
as another lowland maiden might have been
on the same occasion she saw with tolerable
composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves
in a semicircle around and in front the
monk and herself all bending upon them in
silence their large fixed eyes expressing as far
as she could judge a wild admiration her
beauty she inclined her head to them and uttered
imperfectly the usual words a highland
salutation the elder and leader the party
returned the greeting and then again remained
silent and motionless the monk told his beads 
and even catharine began to have strange fears
for her personal safety and anxiety to know whether
they were to consider themselves at personal
freedom she resolved to make the experiment
and moved forward as if to descend the
hill but when she attempted to pass the line 
highlanders they extended their poleaxes betwixt
each other so as effectually to occupy each
opening through which she could have passed
somewhat disconcerted yet not dismayed
for she could not conceive that any evil was intended
she sat down upon one the scattered
fragments rock and bade the monk standing
by her side be good courage
if i fear said father clement it is not
for myself for whether i be brained with the
axes these wild men like an ox when worn
out by labour he is condemned to the slaughter
or whether i am bound with their bowstrings
and delivered over to lliose who will take my
life with more cruel ceremony it can but little
concern me if they suffer thee dearest daughter
to escape uninjured
we have neither us replied the maiden
 perth any cause for apprehending evil 
and here comes conachar to assure us it
yet as she spoke she almost doubted her own
eyes so altered were the manner and attire 
the handsome stately and almost splendidly
dressed youth who springing like a roebuck
from a cliff considerable height lighted justin
front her his dress was the same tartan
worn by those who had first made their appearance
but closed at the throat and elbows with
a necklace and armlets gold the hauberk
which he wore over his person was steel
but so clearly burnished that it shone like silver
his arms were profusely ornamented and
his bonnet besides the eagle's feather marking
the quality chief was ornamented with a
chain gold wrapt several times around it
and secured by a large clasp adorned with
pearls his brooch by which the tartan mantle
or plaid as it is now called was secured on the
shoulder was also gold large and curiously
carved he bore no weapon in his hand excepting
a small sapling stick with a hooked
head his whole appearance and gait which
used formerly to denote a sullen feeling conscious
degradation was now bold forward and
haughty and he stood before catharine with
smiling confidence as if fully conscious his
improved appearance and waiting till she should
recognise him
conachar said catharine desirous to
break this state suspense are these your
father's men 
no fair catharine answered the young
man conachar is no more unless in regard
to the wrongs he has sustained and the vengeance
which they demand i am ian machin
maclan son to the chief the clan quhele
i have mounted my feathers as you see when i
changed my name and for these men they
are not my father's followers but mine you
see only one half them collected they forma
band consisting my foster father and eight
sons who are my bodyguard and the children
 my belt who breathe but to do my will
but conachar he added in a softer tone 
voice lives again so soon as catharine desires
to see him and while he is the young chief 
the clan quhele to all others he is to her as
humble and obedient as when he was simon
glover's apprentice see here is the stick i
had from you when we nutted together in the
sunny braes enoch when autumn was
young in the year that is gone i would not
part with it catharine for the truncheon my
tribe
while euclid thus spoke catharine began
to doubt in her own mind whether she had acted
prudently in requesting the assistance a bold
young man elated doubtless by his sudden
elevation from a state servitude to one which
she was aware gave him extensive authority
over a very lawless body adherents
 you do not fear me fair catharine said
the young chief taking her hand i suffered
my people to appear before me for a few minutes
that i miffht see how you could cnduie their
presence iiud methiiikti you regarded them as
if you were born to be a chieftain's wife
i have no reason to fear wrong from highlanders
said catharine firmly especially as
 thought conachar was with them conachar
has drunk our cup and eaten our bread 
and my father has often had traffic with highlanders
and never was there wrong or quarrel
betwixt him and them
no replied hector for such is the saxon
equivalent for eachin what never when
he took the part the gow chron the 
smith against eachin maclan 
say nothing to excuse it and believe it will
be your own fault if i ever again allude to it
but you had some command to lay upon me 
speak and you shall be obeyed
catharine hastened to reply for there was
something in the young chief's manner and
language which made her desire to shorten
the interview
eachin she said since conachar is no
hunger your name you ought to be sensible
that in claiming as i honestly might a service
from my equal i little thought that was addressing
a person such superior power and
consequence you as well as i have been obliged
to the religious instruction this goodman
he is now in great danger wicked men
have accused him with false charges and he is
desirous to remain in safety and concealment
till the storm shall pass away
aha the good clerk clement ay the
worthy clerk did much for me and more than
my rugged temper was capable to profit by i
will be glad to see any one in the town 
perth persecute one who hath taken hold 
maclan's mantle 
it may not be safe to trust too much to
that said catharine i nothing doubt the
power your tribe but when the black douglas
takes up a feud he is not to be scared by
the shaking a highland plaid
the highlander disguised his displeasure at
this speech with a forced laugh
the sparrow he said that is next the
eye seems larger than the eagle that is perched
on bcngoilc you fear the douglasseses most because
they sit next to you but be it as you
will you will not believe how wide our hills
and vales and forests extend beyond the dusky
barrier yonder mountains and you think
all the world lies on the banks the tay
but this good clerk shall see hills that could
hide him were all the douglasseses on his quest 
ay and he shall see men enough also to make
them glad to get once more southward the
grampian and wherefore should you not
go with the good man i will send a party to
bring him in safety from perth and we will setup
the old trade beyond loch tay only no more
cutting out gloves for me i will find your
father in hides but i will not cut them save
when they are on the createes backs
my father will come one day and see your
housekeeping conachar i mean hector 
but times must be quieter for there is feud between
the town'speople and the followers 
the noblemen and there is speech war about
to break out in the highlands
yes by our lady catharine and were it
not for that same higlihmd war you should
not thus put off your highland visit my pretty
mistress but the race the hills are no
longer to be divided into two nations they
will fight like men for the supremacy and he
who gets it will deal with the king scotland
as an equal not as a superior pray that the
victory may fall to maclan my pious st catharine
for thou shalt pray for one who loves thee
dearly
i will pray for the right said catharine 
 or rather i will pray that there be peace on
all sides farewell kind and excellent father
clement believe i shall never forget thy lessons
 remember me in thy prayers but how
wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome

they shall carry him if need be said
hector if we go far without finding a horse
for him but you catharine it is far from
hence to perth let me attend you thither as
i was wont
if you were as you were wont i would
not refuse your escort but gold brooches
and bracelets are perilous company when the
lauderdale and annandale lancers are riding
as throng upon the highway as the leaves at
hollowness and there is no safe meeting betwixt
highland tartans and steel jackets
she hazarded this remark as she somewhat
suspected that in casting his slough young
eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits
which he had acquired in his humbler state and
that though he might use bold words he would
not be rash enough to brave the odds numbers
to which a descent into the vicinity 
the city would be likely to expose him it appeared
that she judged correctly for after a
farewell in which she compounded for the immunity
 her lips by permitting him to kiss
her hand she returned towards perth and
could obtain at times when she looked back an
occasional glance the highlanders as winding
through the most concealed and impracticable
paths they bent their way towards the
north
she felt in paint relieved from her immediate
anxiety bb the distance increased betwixt her
and these men whose actions were only directed
by the will their chief and whose chief
was a giddy and impetuous boy she apprehended
no insult on her return to perth from
the soldiery any party whom she might meet 
for the rules chivalry were in those days a
surer protection to a maiden decent appearance
than an escort armed men whose cognizance
might not be acknowledged as friendly
by any other party whom they might chance
to encounter but more remote dangers pressed
on her apprehension the pursuit the
licentious prince was rendered formidable by
threats which his unprincipled counsellor ramorn
had not shunned to utter against her
father if she persevered in her coyness these
menaces in such an age and from such a character
were deep grounds for alarm nor could
she consider the pretensions to her favour which
conachar had scarce repressed during his state
 servitude and seemed now to avow boldly
as less fraught with evil since there had been repeated
incursions the highlanders into the
very town perth and citizens had on more
occasions than one been made prisoners and
carried off from their own houses or had fallen
by the claymore in the very streets their city
she feared too her father's importunity on
behalf the smith whose conduct on st
valentine's day unworthy reports had reached
her and whose suit had he stood clear in
her good opinion she dared not listen to while
ramorny's threats revenge upon her father
rung on her ear she thought on these various
dangers with the deepest apprehension and an
earnest desire to escape from them and herself
by taking refuge in the cloister but saw no
possibility obtaining her father's consent to
the only course from which she expected peace
and protection
in the course these reflections we cannot
discover that she very distinctly regretted
that her perils attended her because she was
the fair maid pei'ih this was one point
which marked that she was not yet altogether
an angel and perhaps it was another that
in despite henry smith's real or supposed
delinquencies a sigh escaped from her bosom
when she thought upon st valentine's
dawn
chapter iii
we have shown the secrets the confessional
 those the sick chamber are not hidden
from us in a darkened apartment where
salves and medicines showed that the leech had
been busy in his craft a tall thin form lay on a
bed arrayed in a nightgown belted around him
with pain on his brow and a thousand stormypassions
agitating his bosom everything in
the apartment indicated a man opulence and
 expense henbane d wining the apothecary
who seemed to have the care the patient
stole with a crafty and catlike step from
one corner the room to another busying
himself with mixing medicines and preparing
dressings the sick man groined once or twice
on which the leech advancing to his bedside
asked whether these sounds were a token 
the pain his body or the distress his
mind
 both thou poisoning varlet said sir
john ramorny and being encumbered
with thy accursed company
if that is all i can relieve your knighthood
 one these ills by presently removing
myself elsewhere thanks to the feuds this
boisterous time had i twenty hands instead 
these two poor servants my art displaying
his skinny palms there is enough employment
for them well requited employment too
where thanks and crowns contend which shall
best pay my services while you sir john
wreak upon your chirurgeon the anger you ought
only to bear against the author your wound
 villain it is beneath me to reply to thee
said the patient but every word thy malignant
tongue is a dirk inflicting wounds which
set all the medicines arabia at defiance
sir john i understand you not but if you
give way to these tempestuous fits rage it is
impossible but fever and inflammation must bethe
result
why then dost thou speak in a sense to
chafe my blood why dost thou name the supposition
 thy worthless self having more
hands than nature gave thee while i a knight
and gentleman am mutilated like a cripple 
sir john replied the chirurgeon i am
no divine nor a mainly obstinate believer in
some things which divines tell us yet i may
remind you that you have been kindly dealt
with for if the blow which has done you this
injury had lighted on your neck as it was
aimed it would have swept your head from
your shoulders instead amputating a less considerable
member
i wish it had d wining i wish it had
lighted as it was addressed i should not then
have seen a policy which had spun a web so
fine as mine burst through by the brute force 
a drunken churl i should not have been reserved
to see horses which i must not mount 
lists which i must no longer enter splendours
vol y
which i cannot hope to share or battles which
i must not take part in i should not with a
manes passions for power and for strife be set to
keep place among the women despised by them
too as a miserable impotent cripple unable to
aim at obtaining the favour the sex
supposing all this to be so i will yet pray
 your knighthood to remark replied dining
still busying himself with arranging the
dressings the wounds that your eyes which
you must have lost with your head may being
spared to you present as rich a prospect 
pleasure as either ambition or victory in the
lists or in the field or the love woman itself
could have proposed to you
my sense is too dull to catch thy meaning
koch replied ramorny what is this precious
spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck 
the dearest that mankind knows replied
dwining and then in the accent a lover who
utters the name his beloved mistress and
expresses his passion for her in the very tone 
his voice he added the word revenge 
the patient had raised himself on his couch
to listen with some anxiety for the solution 
the physician's enigma he laid himself down
again as he heard it explained and after a short
pause asked in what christian college learned
you this morality good master d wining 
in no christian college answered his
physician for though it is privately received
in most it is openly and manfully adopted in
none but i have studied among the sages 
granada where the fierysouled moor lifts high
his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemy's
blood and avows the doctrine which the pallid
christian practises though cowardlike he dare
not name it
thou art then a more highsouled villain
than i deemed thee said ramorny
let that pass answered d wining the
waters that are the stillest are also the deepest 
and the foe is most to be dreaded who never
threatens till he strikes you knights and menatarms
go straight to your purpose with sword
in hand we who are clerks win our access
with a noiseless step and an indirect approach
but attain our object not less surely
and i said the knight who have trod
to my revenge with a mailed foot which made
all echo around it must now use such a slipper
as thine ha v
he who lacks strengths said the wily medicine
 must attain his purpose by skill
and tell me sincerely medicine wherefore
thou wouldst read me these devils lessons
why wouldst thou thrust me faster or further
on to my vengeance than i may seem to thee
ready to go my own accord i am old in the
ways the world man and i know that such
as thou do not drop words in vain or thrust
themselves upon the dangerous confidence 
men like me sae with the prospect advancing
some purpose their own what interest
hast thouin the roach whether peaceful or bloody
which i may pursue on these occurrence 
in plain dealing sir knight though it is
 what i seldom use answered the leech my
road to revenge is the same with yours
with mine man said ramorny with a
tone scornful surprise i thought it had
been high beyond thy reach thou aim at the
same revenge with ramorny 
 ay truly replied divining for the
smithy churl under whose blow you have suffered
has often done me despite and injury
he has thwarted me in council and despised
me in action his brutal and unhesitating
bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety 
my natural disposition i fear him and i hate
him
 and you hope to find an active coadjutor
in me said ramorny in the same supercilious
tone as before but know the artizan fellow
is too low in degree to be to me either
the object hatred or fear yet he shall not
escape we hate not the reptile that has stung
us though we might shake it off the wound
and tread upon it i know the ruffian old asa
stout manatarmsj and a pretender as i have
heard to the favour the scornful puppet
whose beauties forsooth spurred us to our wise
and hopeful attempt fiends that direct this
nether world by what malice have you decided
that the hand which has couched a lance against
the bosom a prince should be struck off like
a saphne by the blow a churl and during
the turmoil a midnight riot well medicine
thus far our courses hold together and i
bid thee well believe that i will crush for thee
this reptile mechanic but do not thou think
to escape me when that part my revenge is
done which will be most easily and speedily accomplished

not it may be altogether so easily accomplished
said the apothecary for if your
knighthood will credit me there will be found
small ease or security in dealing with him he is
the strongest boldest and most skilful swordsman
in perth and all the country around it
fear nothing he shall be met with had he
the strength sampson but then mark me 
hope not thou to escape my vengeance unless
thou become my passive agent in the scene
which is to follow mark me i say once more
i have studied at no moorish college and lack
some thy unbounded appetite for revenge
but yet i will have my share vengeance 
listen to me medicine while i shall thus far
unfold myself but beware treachery for
powerful as ihy fiend is thou hast taken lessons
from a meaner devil than mine hearken
the master whom i have served through vice
and virtue with too much zeal for my own
character perhaps but with unshaken fidelity
to him the very man to soothe whose frantic
folly i have incurred this irreparable loss is
at the prayer his doating father about to
sacrifice me by turning me out his favour
and leaving me at the mercy the hypocritical
relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation
at my expense if he perseveres in
this most ungrateful purpose thy fiercest moors
were their complexion swarthy as the smoke 
hell shall blush to see their revenge outdone 
but i will give him one more chance for honour
and safety before my wrath shall descend on
him in unrelenting and unmitigated fury 
there then thus far thou hast my confidence 
close hands on our bargain close hands did
i say where is the hand that should be the
pledge and representative ramorny's plighted
word is it nailed on the public pillory or
flung as offal to the houseless dogs who arc
even now snarling over it lay thy finger on
s
the mutilated stump then and swear to be a
faithful actor in my revenge as i shall be iii
yours how now sir leech look you pale 
you who say to death stand back or advance
can you tremble to think him or to hear him
named i have not mentioned your fee for one
who loves revenge for itself requires no deeper
bribe yet if broad lands and large sums 
gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause
believe me these shall not be lacking
they tell for something in my humble
wishes said dwining the poor man in this
bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a
crowd and so trodden under foot the rich and
powerful rise like giants above the press and
are at ease while all is turmoil around them
then shalt thou arise above the press medicine
as high as gold can raise thee this
purse is weighty yet it is but an earnest 
thy guerdon
and this smith my noble benefactor 
said tle leech as he pouched the gratuity 
 this henry the wynd or whatever is his
name would not the news that he hath paid
the penalty his action assuage the pain 
thy knighthood's wound better than the barra
 mecca with which i have salved it 
he is beneath the thoughts ramorny 
and i have no more resentment against him
than i have illwill at the senseless weapon which
he swayed but it is just thy hate should be
vented upon him where is he chiefly to be met
with
that also i have considered said dining
 to make the attempt by day in his
own house were too open and dangerous for
he hath five servants who work with him at
the stithy four them strong knaves and all
loving to their master by night were scarce less
desperate for he hath his doors strongly fastened
with bolt oak and bar iron and ere
the fastenings his house could be forced the
neighbourhood would rise to his rescue especially
as they are still alarmed by the practice
on st valentine's even
o ay true medicine said ramorny
for deceit is thy nature even with me thou
knowest my hand and signet as thou saddest
when my hand was found cast out on the street
like the disgusting refuse a shambles wliy
having such knowledge dentist thou with these
jolterheaded citizens to consult that patrick
charteris whose spurs should be hacked off
from his heels for the communion which he
holds with paltry burghers and whom thou
brought st here with the fools to do dishonour
to the lifeless hand which had it held its
wonted place he was not worthy to have touched
in peace or faced in war 
my noble patron as soon as i had reason
to know you had been the sufferer i urged them
with all my powers persuasion to desist from
prosecuting the feud but the swaggering smith
and one or two other hot heads cried out for
vengeance your knighthood must know this
fellow calls himself bachelor to the fair maiden
 perth and stands upon his honour to follow
up her father's quarrel but i have forestalled
his market in that quarter and that is something
in earnest revenge
how mean you by that sir leech said
the patient
your knighthood shall conceive said the
modicinor that this smith doth not live
m
within compass but is an outlier and a galliard
i met him myself on st valentine's
day shortly after the affray between the townsfolk
and the followers douglas yes i met
him sneaking through the lanes and bypassages
with a common minstrel wench with her
messan and her viol on his one arm and her
buxom self hanging upon the other what thinks
your honour is not this a trim squire to cross
a prince's love with the fairest girl in perth
strike off the hand a knight and baron and
become gentlemanusher to a strolling gleewoman
all in the course the same fourandtwenty
hours 
marry i think the better him that he
is so much a gentleman's humour clown
though he be said ramorny i would he
had been a precisian instead a galliard and
i should have had better heart to aid thy revenge
 and such revenge revenge on a smith
in the quarrel a pitiful manufacturer rotten
cheveron and yet it shall be taken in full
thou hast commenced it i warrant me by
thine own manoeuvres
in a small degree only said the apothecary
 i took care that two or three the
most notorious gossips in curfew street who
liked not to hear catharine called the fair
maid perth should be possessed this story
 her faithful valentine they opened on the
scent so keenly that rather than doubt had
fallen on the tale they would have vouched for
it as if their own eyes had seen it the lover
came to her father's within an hour after and
your worship may think what a reception he had
from the angry glover for the damsel herself
would not be looked upon and thus your honour
sees i had a foretaste revenge but i
trust to receive the full draught from the hands
 your lordship with whom i am in a brotherly
league which 
brotherly said the knight contemptuously
 but be it so the priests say we are all
 one common earth i cannot tell there
seems to me some difference but the better
mould shall keep faith with the baser and
thou shalt have thy revenge call thou my
page hither
a young man made his appearance from
the anteroom upon the physician's summons
 eviot said the knight does southron
wait and is he sober
he is as sober as sleep can make him after
a deep drink answered the page
 then fetch him hither and do thou shut
the door
a heavy step presently approached the apartment
and a man entered whose deficiency 
height seemed made up in breadth shoulders
and strength arm
there is a man thou must deal upon bonthrone
said the knight
the man smoothed his rugged features and
grinned a smile satisfaction
that medicine will show thee the party
take such advantage time place and circumstance
as will ensure the result and mind
you come not by the worst for the man is the
fighting smith the wynd
it will be a tough job growled the assassin
 for if i miss my blow i may esteem
myself but a dead man all perth rings with
the smith's skill and strength
take two assistants with thee said the
knight
not i said bonthron if you double
anything let it be the reward
account it doubled said his master but
see thy work be thoroughly executed
trust me for that sir knight seldom
have i failed
use this sage man's directions said the
wounded man pointing to the physician and
hark thee await his coming forth and drink
not till the business be done
i will not answered the dark satellite my
own life depends on my blow being steady and
sure i know whom i have to deal with
vanish then till he summons you and
have axe and dagger in readiness
bonthron nodded and withdrew
 will your knighthood venture to intrust
such an act to a single hand said the medicine
when the assassin had left the room may
i pray you to remember that yonder party did
two nights since baffle six armed men 
question me not sir mcdicincr a manlike
bonthron who knows time and place is
worth a score confused revellers call eviot
thou shalt first exert thy powers healing
and do not doubt that thou shalt in the farther
work be aided by one who will match thee in
the art sudden and unexpected destruction
the page eviot again appeared at the medicine's
summons and at his master's sign assisted
the chirurgeon in removing the dressings
from sir john ramorny's wounded arm
dwining viewed the naked stump with a species
 professional satisfaction enhanced no
doubt by the malignant pleasure which his evil
disposition took in the pain and distress his
fellowcreatures the knight just turned his
eye on the ghastly spectacle and uttered under
the pressure bodily pain or mental agony a
groan which he would fain have repressed
you groan sir said the leech in his soft
insinuating tone voice but with a sneer 
enjoyment mixed with scorn curling upon his
lip which his habitual dissimulation could not
altogether disguise you groan but be comforted
this henry smith knows his business
it
 bis sword is as true to its aim as his hammer
to the anvil had a common swordsman struck
this fatal blow be bad harmed the bone and
damaged the muscles so that even my art might
not have been able to repair them but henry
smith's cut is clean and as sure as that with
which my own scalpel could have made the
amputation in a few days you will be able
with care and attention to the ordinances medicine
to stir abroad
but my hand the loss my hand 
it may be kept secret for a time said
the medicine i have possessed two or three
tattling fools in deep confidence that the baud
which was found was that your knighthood's
groom black quentin and your knighthood
knows that he is parted for fife in such sort
as to make it generally believed
 i know well enough said ramorny that
the rumour may stifle the truth for a short time
but what avails this brief delay 
it may be concealed till your knighthood
retires for a time from the court and then when
new accidents have darkened the recollection
f the pr
iiy we have much that is superfluous about us
man can see with one eye hear with one ear
touch with one hand smell with one nostril 
and why we should have two each unless
to supply an accidental loss or injury i for
one am at a loss to conceive
sir john ramorny turned from the prince
with a low groan
 nay sir john said the duke i am
quite serious you know the truth touching the
legend steelhand carnegie better than i
since he was your own neighbour in his time
that curious engine could only be made in rome 
but i will wager an hundred marks with you
that let the perth armourer have the use it
for a pattern henry the wynd will execute
as complete an imitation as all the smiths in
rome could accomplish with all the cardinals
to bid a blessing on the work
i could venture to accept your wager my
lord answered ramorny bitterly but there
is no time for foolery you have dismissed me
from your service at command your uncle 
at command my father answered the
prince
 
 upon whom your uncle's commands arc
imperative replied ramorny i am a disgraced
man thrown aside as i may now flints
away my right hand glove as a thing useless
yet my head might help you though my hail
he gone is your grace disposed to listen tome
for one word serious import for i am
much exhausted and feel my force sinking under
me
speak your pleasure said the prince 
 thy loss binds me to hear thee thy bloody
stump is a sceptre to control me speak then
but be merciful in thy strength privilege
i will be brief for mine own sake as well
as thine indeed i have but little to say douglas
places himself immediately at the head his
vassals he will assemble in the name king
robert thirty thousand borderers whom he
will shortly after lead into the interior to demand
that the duke roth say receive or either
restore his daughter to the rank and privileges
 his duchess king robert will yield
to any conditions which may secure peace 
what will the duke do
 the duke rothsay loves peace said
the prince haughtily but he never feared
war ere he takes back yonder proud peat to
his table and his bed at the command her
father douglas must be king scotland
 be it so but even this is the less pressing
peril especially as it threatens open violence
for the douglas works not in secret
 what is there which presses and keeps us
awake at this late hour i am a weary man
thou a wounded one and the very tapers are
blinking as if tired our conference
tell me then who is it that rules this
kingdom scotland said ramorny
robert third the name said the prince
raising his bonnet as he spoke and long
may he sway the sceptre 
true and amen answered ramorny 
but who sways king robert and dictates
almost every measure which the good king
pursues
my lord albany you would say replied
the prince yes it is true my father
is guided almost entirely bv tir counsels lii

brother uor can we blame him in our consciences
sir john ramorny for little help hath
he had from his son
let us help him now my lord said ramorn
 i am possessor a dreadful secret
albany hath been trafficking with me to join
him in taking your grace's life he offers full
pardon for the past high favour for the future
how man my life i trust though thou
dost only mean my kingdom it were impious 
he is my father's brother they sat on the knees
 the same father lay in the bosom the
same mother out on thee man what follies
they make thy sickbed believe 
believe indeed said ramorny it is
new to me to be termed credulous but the
man through whom albany communicated his
temptations is one whom all will believe so
soon as he hints at mischief even the medicaments
which are prepared by his hands have a
relish poison
tush such a slave would slander a saint
replied the prince thou art duped for once
ramon shrewd as thou art mv uncle albany
is ambitious aud would secure for himself
and for his house a larger portion power and
wealth than he ought in reason to desire but
to suppose he would dethrone or slay his brother's
son fie ramorny put me not to quote
the old saw that evil doers are evil readers 
it is your suspicion not your knowledge which
speaks
your grace is fatally deluded i will put
it to an issue the duke albany is generally
hated for his greed and covetousness your
highness is it may be more beloved than 
ramorny stopped the prince calmly filled
ap the blank more beloved than i am honoured
it is so i would have it ramorny
at least said ramorny you are more
beloved than you are feared and that is no safe
condition for a prince but give me your honour
and knightly word that you will not resent
what good service i shall do in your behalf
and lend me your signet to engage friends
in your name and the duke albany shall
not assume authority in this court till the
wasted band which ojicc terminated this stump
shall be again united lo the body aud acting in
obedience to the dictates my mind
you would not venture to dip your hands
in royal blood said the prince sternly
fie my lord at no rate blood need not
be shed life may nay will be extinguished 
itself for want trimming it with fresh oil
or screening it from a breath wind the quivering
light will die in the socket to suffer a
man to die is not to kill him
true i had forgot that policy well then
suppose my uncle albany does not continue to
live i think that must be the phrase who
then rules the court scotland 
robert the third with consent advice
and authority the most mighty robert duke
 rothsay lieutenant the kingdom and aller
ego in whose favour indeed the good
king wearied with the fatigues and troubles 
sovereignty will i guess be well disposed to
abdicate so long live our brave young monarch
king robert the fourth 
 ille viaiu fortis
angles ludehit in hostis 
and our father and predecessor said
rothsay will he continue to live to pray for
us as our beadsman by whose favour he holds
the privilege laying his grey hairs in the grave
as soon and no earlier than the course nature
permits or must he also encounter some
 those negligence in consequence which
men cease to continue to live and exchange the
limits a prison or a convent resembling
one for the dark and tranquil cell where the
priests say that the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest 
you speak in jest my lord replied ramorn
 to harm the good old king were
equally unnatural and impolitic
 why shrink from that man when thy whole
scheme answered the prince in stern displeasure
 is one lesson unnatural guilt mixed
with shortsighted ambition if the king 
scotland can scarcely make head against his
nobles even now when he can hold up before
them an unsullied and honourable banner who
would follow a prince that is blackened with the
death an uncle and the imprisonment a

father why man tby policy were enough to
revolt a heathen divan to say nought the council
 a christian nation thou wert my tutor
ramorny and perhaps i might justly upbraid
thy lessons and example for some the follies
which men chide in me perhaps if it had
not been for thee i had not been standing at
midnight in this fool's guise looking at his
dress to hear an ambitious profligate propose
to me the murder an imcle the dethroning
 the best fathers since it is my fault as
well as thine that has sunk me so deep in the
gulf infamy it were unjust that thou alone
shouldst die for it but dare not to renew this
theme to me on peril thy life i will proclaim
thee to my father to albany to scotland
 throughout its length and breadth as
many market crosses as are in the land shall
have morsels the traitor's carcass who dare
counsel such horrors to the heir scotland 
well hope i indeed that the fever thy wound
and the intoxicating influence the cordials
which act on thy infirm brain have this night operated
on thee rather than any fixed purpose
 suotb my lord said ramon it i
have said anything which could so greatly exasperate
your highness it must have been by
excess zeal mingled with imbecility understanding
surely i all men am least
likely to propose ambitious projects with a prospect
 advantage to myself alas my only
future views must be to exchange lance and
saddle for the breviary and the confessional
the convent minores must receive the maimed
and impoverished knight ramorny who
will there have ample leisure to meditate upon
the text put not thy faith in princes 
it is a goodly purpose said the prince 
and we will not be lacking to promote it
our separation i thought would have been but
for a time it must now be perpetual certainly
after such talk as we have held it were
sleet that we should live asunder but the
convent minores or whatever other house receives
thee shall be richly endowed and highly
favoured by us and now sir john ramorn
sleep sleep and forget this 
conversation in which the fever disease
and wine lias rather i trust held colloquy
than your own proper thoughts light to the
door eviot
a call from eviot summoned the attendants
 the prince who had been sleeping on the
staircase and hall exhausted by the revels 
the evening
js there none amongst you sober said
the duke rothsay disgusted by the appearance
 his attendants
not a man not a man answered the followers
with a drunken shout we are none 
us traitors to the emperor merrymakers
and are all you turned into brutes
then said the prince
 in obedience and imitation your grace
answered one fellow or if we are a little
behind you one pull at the pitcher will 
 peace beast said the duke rothsay
are there none you sober i say 
yes my noble liege was the answer 
here is one false brother watkins the englishman

come liithor then watkins and aid mc

with a torch give me a cloak too and another
bonnet and take away this trumpery throwing
down his coronet feathers i would i
could throw off all my follies as easily english
wat attend me alone and the rest you
 your revelry and doff your mumming habits
the holytide is expended and the fast
has begun
our monarch has abdicated sooner than
usual this night said one the revel rout 
but as the prince gave no encouragement such
as happened for the time to want the virtue 
sobriety endeavoured to assume it as well as
they could and the whole the late rioters began
to adopt the appearance a set decent
persons who having been surprised into intoxication
endeavour to disguise their condition
by assuming a double portion formality 
behaviour in the interim the prince having
made a hasty reform in his dress was lighted
to the door by the only sober man the company
but in his progress thither had wellnigh
stumbled over the sleeping bulk the brute
bonthrou
 how now is that vile beast in our way
once more he said in anger and disgust
here some you toss this caitiff into the
horsetrough that for once in his life he maybe
washed clean
while the train executed his commands availing
themselves a fountain which was in the
outer court and while bonthron underwent a
discipline which he was incapable resisting
otherwise than by some inarticulate groans and
snorts like those a dying boar the prince
proceeded on his way to his apartments in a
mansion called the constable's lodgings from
the house being the property the earls errol
on the way to divert his thoughts from
more un pleasing matters the prince asked his
companion how he came to be sober when the
rest the party had been so much overcome
with liquor
so please your honour's grace replied
english wat i confess it was very familiar in
me to be sober when it was your grace's pleasure
that your train should be mad drunk butin
respect they were all scotchmen but myself
i thought it argued no policy iu getting
drunken in their company seeing that they
only endure me even when we are all sober
and if the wine were uppermost i might tell
them a piece my mind and be paid with as
many stabs as there are scenes in the good company

so it is your purpose never to join any 
the revels our household 
under favour yes unless it be your grace's
pleasure that the residue your train should
remain one day sober to admit will watkins
to get drunk without terror his life
such occasion may arrives where dost
thou serve watkins 
in the stable so please you
let our chamberlain bring thee into the
household as a yeoman the nightwatch i
like thy favour and it is something to have one
sober fellow in the house although he is only
such through the fear death attend therefore
near our person and thou shalt find sobriety
a thriving virtue
meantime a load care and fear added to
the distress sir john ramornys sickchamber
his reflections disordered as they were
by the opiate fell into great confusion when
the prince in whose presence he had suppressed
its effect by strong resistance had left the
apartment his consciousness which he had
possessed perfectly during the interview began
to be very much disturbed he felt a general
sense that he had incurred a great danger
that he had rendered the prince his enemy
and that he had betrayed to him a secret which
might affect his own life in this state mind
and body it was not strange that he should
either dream or else that his diseased organs
should become subject to that species phantasmagoria
which is excited by the use opium
he thought that the shade queen arabella
stood by his bedside and demanded the
youth whoih she had placed under his charge
simple virtuous gay and innocent
thou hast rendered him reckless dissolute
and vicious said the shade pallid majesty
yet i thank thee john ramorny ungrateful
to me false to thy word and treacherous to
u
my hopes thy hate shall counteract the evil
which thy friendship has done to him and
well do i hope that now thou art no longer his
counsellor a bitter penance on earth may purchase
my illfated child pardon and acceptance
in a better world
ramorny stretched out his arms after his benefactress
and endeavoured to express contrition
and excuse but the countenance the
apparition became darker and sterner till it was
no longer that the late queen but presented
the gloomy and haughty countenance the
black douglas then the timid and sorrowful
face king robert who seemed to mourn over
the approaching dissolution his royal house 
and then a group fantastic features partly
hideous partly ludicrous which moped and
chattered and twisted themselves into unnatural
and extravagant forms as if ridiculing his
endeavour to obtain an exact idea their lineaments

chapter vl
the morning ash wednesday arose pale
and bleak as usual at this season in scotland
where the worst and most inclement weather
often occurs in the early spring months it
was a severe day frost and the citizens hai
to sleep away the consequences the preceding
holiday's debauchery the sun had therefore
risen for an hour above the horizon before there
was any general appearance life among the
inhabitants perth so that it was some time
after daybreak when an early citizen going to
mass saw the body the luckless oliver proudfate
lying on his face across the kennel in the
manner in which he had fallen under the blow
as our readers will easily imagine antony
vol ir m
bonthron the boy the belt that is the executioner
 the pleasure john ramorny
this early citizen was allan griffin so termed
because he was master the griffin inn 
and the alarm which he raised soon brought together
first straggling neighbours and by and
by a concourse citizens at first from the
circumstance the wellknown buffcoat and
the crimson feather in the headpiece the noise
arose that it was the stout smith that lay there
slain this false rumour continued for sometime
 for the host the griffin who himself
had been a magistrate would not permit the
body to be touched or stirred till bailie craigdallied
arrived so that the face was not seen
 this concerns the fair city my friends
he said and if it is the stout smith the
wynd who lies here the man lives not in perth
who will not risk land and life to avenge him
look you the villains have struck him down
behind his back for there is not a man within
ten scotch miles perth gentle or semple
highland or lowland that would have met him
face to face with such evil purpose oh brave
men perth the flower your manhood has
been cut down and that by a base and treacherous
hand 
a wild cry fury arose from the people who
were fast assembling
we will take him on our shoulders said
a strong butcher we will carry him to the
king's presence at the dominican convent
 ay ay answered a blacksmith neither
bolt nor bar shall keep us from the king neither
monk nor mass shall break our purpose a better
armourer never laid hammer on anvil 
 to the dominicans to the dominicans 
shouted the assembled people
bethink you burghers said another citizen
 our king is a good king and loves us
like his children it is the douglas and the duke
 albany that will not let good king robert
hear the distresses his people
are we to be slain in our own streets for
the king's softness heart said the butcher
the bruce did otherwise if the king will
not keep us we will keep ourselves ring the
bells backward every bell them that is
made metal cry and spare not st johnston's
hunt is up 
ay cried another citizen and let us to
the holds albany and the douglas and burn
them to the ground let the fires tell far and
near that perth knew how to avenge her stout
henry gow he has fought a score times
for the fair city's right let us show we can
fight once to avenge his wrong hallo ho 
brave citizens st johnstoun's hunt is up 
this cry the wellknown rallying word
amongst the inhabitants perth and seldom
heard but on occasions general uproar was
echoed from voice to voice and one or two
neighbouring steeples which the enraged citizens
possessed themselves either by consent 
the priests or in spite their opposition began
to ring out the ominous alarm notes in which
as the ordinary succession the chimes were
reversed the bells were said to be rung backward

still as the crowd thickened and the roar
waxed more universal and louder allan griftmi
a burly man with a deep voice and well respected
among high and low kept this station
as he bestrode the corpse and called loudly to
the multitude to keep back and wait the arrival
 the magistrates
we must proceed by order in this matter
my masters we must have our magistrates atour
head they are duly chosen and elected
in our townhall good men and true every one 
we will not be called rioters or idle perturbations
 the king's peace stand you still and
make room for yonder comes bailie craigdal
lie ay and honest simon glover to whom the
fair city is so much bounden alas alas my
kind townsmen his beautiful daughter was a
bride yesternight this morning the fair maid
 perth is a widow before she has been a
wife
this new theme sympathy increased the
rage and sorrow the crowd the more as many
women now mingled with them who echoed
back the alarm cry to the men
ay ay st johnstoun's hunt is up for
the fair maid perth and the brave henry
gow up up every one you spare not for
your skincutting to the stables to the stables
 when the horse is gone the manatarms
is useless cut off the grooms and yeomen
lame maim and stab the horses kill the base
squires and pages let these proud knights
meet us on their feet if they dare 
they dare not they dare not answered
the men their strength is in their horses and
armour and yet the haughty and ungrateful
villains have slain a man whose skill as an armourer
was never matched in indian or venice
to arms to arms brave burghers st johnston's
hunt is up 
amid this clamour the magistrates and superior
class inhabitants with difficulty obtained
room to examine the body having with
them the townclerk to take an official protocol
or as it is still called a precognition the
condition in which it was found to these delays
the multitude submitted with a patience
and order which strongly marked the national
character a people whose resentment has always
been the more deeply dangerous that they
will without relaxing their determination 
vengeance submit with patience to all delays
which are necessary to ensure its attainment
the multitude therefore received their magistrates
with a loud cry in which the thirst 
revenge was announced together with the deferential
welcome to the patrons by whose direction
they expected to obtain it in right and
legal fashion
while these accents welcome still rung
above the crowd who now filled the whole adjacent
streets receiving and circulating a thousand
varying reports the fathers the city
caused the body to be raised and more closely
examined when it was instantly perceived and
the truth publicly announced that not the armourer
 the wynd so highly and according
to the esteemed qualities the time so justly
popular among his fellow citizens but a man
 far less general estimation though not without
his own value in society lay murdered before
them the brisk bonnetmaker oliver
proudfute the resentment the people had
so much turned upon the general opinion that
their frank and brave champion henry gow
was the slaughtered person that the contradiction
 the report served to cool the general
fury although if poor oliver had been recognised
at first there is little doubt that the cry
 vengeance would have been as unanimous as
in the case henry wynd the first circulation
 the unexpected intelligence even excited
a smile among the crowd so near are the
confines the ludicrous to those the terrible
the murderers have without doubt taken
him for henry smith said griffin which
must have been a great comfort to him in the
circumstances
but the arrival other persons on the scene
soon restored its deeply tragic character
j
chapter v ir
who that light rings the b diablo ho 
the town will rise
othello
the wild rumours which flew through the
town speedily followed by the tolling the
alarm bells spread general consternation the
nobles and knights with their followers gathered
in different places rendezvous where a
defence could best be maintained and the alarm
reached the royal residence where the young
prince was one the first to appear to assist
if necessary in the defence the old king
the scene the preceding night ran in his recollection
 and remembering the bloodstained
figure bonthron he conceived though indistinctly
that his act had been connected with
this uproar the subsequent and more interesting
discourse with sir john ramorny had
however been such an impressive nature as
to obliterate all traces what he had indistinctly
heard the bloody act the assassin
excepting a confused recollection that some one
or other had been slain it was chiefly on his
father's account that he had assumed arms with
his household train who clad in bright armour
and bearing lances in their hands made now
a figure very different from that the preceding
night when they appeared as intoxicated
bacchanalian the kind old monarch received
this mark filial attachment with tears gratitude
and proudly presented his son to his
brother albany who entered shortly after wards
he took them each by the hand
now are we three robin stewart he said
as inseparable as the holy trefoil and as
they say the wearer that sacred herb mocks
at magical delusion so we while we are true
to each other may set malice and enmity at defiance

the brother and son kissed the kind hand
which pressed theirs while robert iii expressed
his confidence in their affection the kiss 
the youth was for the time sincere that the
brother was the salute the apostate judas
in the meantime the bell saint john's
church alarmed amongst others the inhabitants
 curfew street in the house simon glover
old dorothy glover as she was called for she
also took name from the trade she practised
under her master's auspices was the first to
catch the sound though somewhat deaf upon
ordinary occasions her ear for bad news was as
sharp as a kite's scent for carrion for dorothy
otherwise an industrious faithful and even
affectionate creature had that strong appetite
for collecting and retailing sinister intelligence
which is often to be marked in the lower
classes little accustomed to be listened to
they love the attention which a tragic tale ensures
to the bearer and enjoy perhaps the temporary
equality to which misfortune reduces
those who are ordinarily accounted their superiors
dorothy had no sooner possessed hcrsel f
 a slight packet the rumours which were
flying abroad than she bounced into her mas
tcrs bedroom who had taken the privilege 
age and the holytide to sleep longer than usual
there he lies honest man said dorothy
half in a screeching and half in a wailing tone
 sympathy there he lies his best friend
slain and he knowing as little about it as the
babe new born that kens not life from death
how now said the glover starting up
out his bed what is the matter old woman
 is my daughter well 
old woman said dorothy who hadng
her fish hooked chose to let him play a little
i am not so old said she flouncing out 
the room as to bide in the place till a man
rises from his naked bed 
and presently she was heard at a distance in
the parlour beneath melodiously singing to the
scrubbing her own broom
 dorothy screechowl devil say but
my daughter is well 
e period already noticed
unrestrained by the considerations doubt
and hesitation which influenced others he repaired
to the parlour and having overheard
the bustling dame shoolbred he took the
privilege intimacy to ascend to the bedroom
and with the slight apology i crave your
pardon good neighbour he opened the door
and entered the apartment where a singular and
unexpected sight awaited him at the sound
 his voice may catharine experienced a revival
much speedier than dame shoolbred's restoratives
had been able to produce and the
paleness her complexion changed into a deep
glow the most lovely red she pushed her
lover from her with both her hands which
until this minute her want consciousness
or her affection awakened by the events the
morning had well nigh abandoned to his caresses
henry smith bashful as we know him
stumbled as he rose up and none the party
were without a share confusion excepting
dame shoolbred who was glad to make some
pretext to turn her back to the others in order
that she might enjoy a laugh at their expense
vol o 
which she felt herself utterly unable to restrain
and in which the glover whose surprise though
great was short duration and a joyful character
sincerely joined
now by good st john he said i thought
i had seen a sight this morning that would cure
me laughter at least till lent was over but
this would make me curl my cheek if i were
dying why here stands honest henry smith
who was lamented as dead and toll'd out for
from every steeple in town alive merry and
as it seems from his ruddy complexion as like
to live as any man in perth and here is my
precious daughter that yesterday would speak
 nothing but the wickedness the wights that
haunt profane sports and protect gleemaidens
ay she who set st valentine and st cupid
both at defiance here she is turned a gleemaiden
herself for what i can see truly i am
glad to see that you my good dame shoolbred
who give way to no disorder have been this
loving party
you do me wrong my dearest father said
catharine as if about to weep i came herewith
far different expectations than you suppose
i only came because because 
because you expected to find a dead lover
said her father and you have found a living
one who can receive the tokens your regard
and return them now were it not a sin i
could find in my heart to thank heaven that
thou hast been surprised at last into owning
thyself a woman simon glover is not worthy
to have an absolute saint for his daughter
nay look not so piteously nor expect condolence
from me only i will try not to look
merry if you will be pleased to stop your tears
or confess them to be tears joy
if i were to die for such a confession said
poor catharine i could not tell what to call
them only believe dear father and let henry
believe that i would never have come hither
unless unless 
unless you had thought that henry coukl
not come to you said her father and now
shake hands in peace and concord and agree as
valentines should yesterday was shrovetide
henry we will hold that thou hast confessed
thy follies hast obtained absolution and art
relieved all the guilt thou stoutest charged
with
nay touching that father simon said the
smith now that you are cool enough to hear
me i can swear on the gospels and i can call
my nurse dame shoolbred to witness 
nay nay said the glover but wherefore
rake up differences which should all be
forgotten 
hark ye simon simon glover this
was now echoed from beneath
true son smith said the glover seriously
 we have other work in hand you and
i must to the council instantly catharine
shall remain here with dame shoolbred who
will take charge her till we return and then
as the town is in misrule we two harry will
carry her home and they will be bold men that
cross us
 nay my dear father said catharine with
a smile now you are taking oliver proudfate's
office that doughty burgher is henry's
broth eratarms
her father's countenance grew dark
you have spoke a stinging word daughter 
but you know not what has happened kiss
him catharine in token forgiveness
not so said catharine i have done
him too much grace already when he has seen
the errant damsel safe home it will be time
enough to claim his reward
meantime said henry i will claim as
your host what you will not allow me on other
terms
he folded the fair maiden in his arms and
was permitted to take the salute which she had
refused to bestow
as they descended the stair together the old
man laid his hand on the smith's shoulder and
said henry my dearest wishes are fulfilled 
but it is the pleasure the saints that it should
be in an hour difficulty and terror
true said the smith but thou knowest
father if our riots be frequent at perth at
least they seldom last long
then opening a door which led from the
house into the smithy here comrade he
cried anton cuthbert dingwell and ringan
 let none you stir from the place till i
return be as true as the weapons i have taught
you to forge a french crown and a scottish
merrymaking for you if you obey my command
i leave a mighty treasure in your charge
watch the doors well let little jannekin scout
up and down the wynd and have your arms
ready if any one approaches the house open
the doors to no man till father glover or return
 it concerns my life and happiness
the strong swarthy giants to whom he spoke
answered death to him who attempts it 
my catharine is now as safe said he to
her father as if twenty men garrisoned a royal
castle in her cause we shall pass most quietly
to the councilhouse by walking through the
garden
he led the way through a little orchard accordingly
where the birds which had been sheltered
and fed during the winter by the goodnatured
artizan early in the season as it was
wire saluting the precarious smiles a february
sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts
at melody
hear these minstrels father said the
smith i laughed at them this morning in
the bitterness my heart because the little
wretches sung with so much winter before
them but now methinks i could bear a blithe
chorus for i have my valentine as they have
theirs and whatever ill may lie before me for
tomorrow i am today the happiest man in
perth city or county burgh or landward
yet i must allay your joy said the old
glover though heaven knows i share it 
poor oliver proudfute the inoffensive fool
that you and i knew so well has been found this
morning dead in the streets
only dead drunk i trust said the smith 
 nay a caudle and a dose matrimonial advice
will bring him to life again
no henry no he is slain slain with a
battleaxe or some such weapon
impossible replied the smith he was
lightfooted enough and would not for all
i
perth have trusted to his hands when he could
extricate himself by his heels
no choice was allowed him the blow was
dealt in the very back his head he who
struck must have been a shorter man than himself
and used a horseman's battleaxe or some
such weapon for a lochaberaxe must have
struck the upper part his head but there
he lies dead brained i may say by a most frightful
wound
this is inconceivable said henry wynd
he was in my house at midnight in a morriver's
habit seemed to have been drinking
though not to excess he told me a tale having
been beset by revellers and being in danger
 but alas you know the man i deemed
it was a swaggering fit as he sometimes took
when he was in liquor and may the merciful
virgin forgive me i let him go without company
in which i did him inhuman wrong holy
st john be my witness i would have gone with
any helpless creature and far more with him
with whom i have so often sat at the same board
and drunken the same cup who the race
 man could have thought harming a creature
 simple and so unoffending excepting by
his idle vaunts 
 henry he wore thy headpiece thy buffcoat
thy target how came he by these 
why he demanded the use them for the
night and i was ill at ease and well pleased
to be rid his company having kept no holiday
and being determined to keep none in respect
 our misunderstanding
it is the opinion bailie craigdallie and
all our sagest councillors that the blow was
intended for yourself and that it becomes you
to prosecute the due vengeance our fellowcitizen
who received the death which was meant
for you
the smith was for some time silent they
had now left the garden and were walking in a
lonely lane by which they meant to approach
the councilhouse the burgh without being
exposed to observation or idle inquiry
you are silent my son yet we two have
much to speak said simon glover bethink
thee that this widowed woman maudlin
if she should see cause to bring a charge against
any one for the wrong done to her and her orphan
children must support it by a champion
according to law and custom for be the murderer
who he may we know enough these
followers the nobles to be assured that the
party suspected will appeal to the combat in
derision perhaps those whom they will call
the cowardly burghers while we are men with
blood in our veins this must not be henry
wynd
i see where you would draw me father
answered henry dejectedly and st john
knows i have heard a summons to battle as
willingly as warhorse ever heard the trumpet
but bethink you father how i have lost
catharine's favour repeatedly and have been
driven well nigh to despair ever regaining
it for being if i may say so even too ready a
man my hands and here are all our quarrels
made up and the hopes that seemed this
morning removed beyond earthly prospect have
become nearer and brighter than ever and
must i with the dear one's kiss forgiveness
on my lips engage in a new scene violence
which you are well aware will give her the
deepest offence 
it is hard for me to advise you henry
said simon but this i must ask you have
you or have you not reason to think that this
poor unfortunate oliver has been mistaken for
you
i fear it too much said henry he was
thought something like me and the poor fool
had studied to ape my gestures and manner 
walking nay the very airs which i have the
trick whistling that he might increase a resemblance
which has cost him dear i have illwillers
enough both in burgh and landward to
owe me a shrewd turn and he i think could
have none such
 well henry i cannot say but my daughter
will be offended she has been much with
father clement and has received notions about
peace and forgiveness which methinks suit ill
with a country where the laws cannot protect
us unless we have spirit to protect ourselves
if you determine for the combat i will do my
best to persuade her to look ou the matter as
the other good womanhood in the burgh will
do and if you resolve to let the matter rest 
the man who has lost his life for yours remaining
unavenged the widow and the orphans
without any reparation for the loss a husband
and father i will then do you the justice to
remember that i at least ought not to think
the worse you for your patience since it was
adopted for love my child but henry we
must in that case remove ourselves from bonny
st johnstoun for here we will be but a disgraced
family
henry groaned deeply and was silent for an
instant then replied i would rather be dead
than dishonoured though i should never see her
again had it been yester evening i would
have met the best blade among these menatarms
as blithely as ever i danced at a maypole
but today when she had first as good as said
henry smith i love thee father glover
it is very hard yet it is all my own fault 
i ought to have allowed him the shelter my
roof lion lie prayed me in his agony fear 
or had i gone with lii i should then have
prevented or shared his fate but i taunted
him ridiculed him loaded him with maledictions
though the saints know they were uttered
in idle peevishness impatience i drove
him out from my doors whom i knew so helpless
to take the fate which was perhaps intended
for me i must avenge him or be dishonoured
for ever see father i have been
called a man hard as the steel i work in does
burnished steel ever drop tears like these 
shame on me that i should shed them 
it is no shame my dearest son said simon 
thou art as kind as brave and i have always
known it there is yet a chance for us no
one may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches
and where none such is found the combat
cannot take place it is a hard thing to
wish that the innocent blood may not be avenged
but if the perpetrator this foul murder
be hidden for the present thou wilt be saved
from the task seeking that vengeance which
heaven doubtless will take at its own proper
time
as they spoke thus they arrived at the point
 the high street where the councilhouse was
situated as they reached the door and made
their way through the multitude who still
thronged the street they found the avenues
guarded by a select party armed burghers
and about fifty spears belonging to the knight
 kinfauns who with his allies the grays
blairs moncrieffs and others had brought to
perth a considerable body horse which
these were a part so soon as the glover and
smith presented themselves they were admitted
to the chamber in which the magistrates
were assembled

chapter viii
the councilroom perth presented a singular
spectacle in a gloomy apartment ill
and inconveniently lighted by two windows
 different form and unequal size were assembled
around a large oaken table a group 
men whom those who occupied the higher
seats were merchants that is guild brethren
or shopkeepers arrayed in decent dresses becoming
their station but most them bearing
like the regent york signs war around
their aged necks gorgets namely and baltricks
which sustained their weapons the
lower places around the table were occupied
by mechanics and artisans the presidents or
deacons as they were termed the working
classes in their ordinary clothes somewhat better
arranged than usual these too wore pieces
 armour various descriptions some had
the black jack or doublet covered with small
plates iron a lozenge shape which secured
through the upper angle hung in rows
above each and which swaying with the motion
 the wearer's person formed a secure defence
to the body others had buffcoats which
as already mentioned could resist the blow 
a sword and even a lance's point unless propelled
with great force at the bottom the
table surrounded as it was with this varied assembly
sat sir louis lundin no military man
but a priest and parson st john's arrayed in
his canonical dress and having his pen and ink
before him he was townclerk the burgh and
like all the priests the period who were called
from that circumstance the pope's knights
received the honourable title dominus contracted
into dom or dan or translated into
sir the title reverence due to the secular
chivalry
on an elevated seat at the head the council
board was placed sir patrick charteris incomplete
armour brightly burnished a singular
contrast to the motley mixture warlike
and peaceful attire exhibited by the burghers
who were only called to arms occasionally
the bearing the provost while it completely
admitted the intimate connexion which mutual
interests had created betwixt himself the burgh
and the magistracy was at the same time calculated
to assert the superiority which in virtue
 gentle blood and chivalrous rank the
opinions the age assigned to him over the
members the assembly in which he presided
two squires stood behind him one them
holding the knight's pennon and another his
shield bearing his armorial distinctions being
a hand holding a dagger or short sword with
the proud motto this is my charter a handsome
page displayed the long sword his master
and another bore his lance all which chivalrous
emblems and appurtenances were the
more scrupulously exhibited that the dignitary
vol p
to whom they belonged was engaged in discharging
the office a burgh magistrate in his own
person the knight kinfauns appeared to affect
something state and stiffness which did
not naturally pertain to his frank and jovial
character
 so you are come at length henry smith
and simon glover said the provost know
that you have kept us waiting for your attendance
should it so chance again while we occupy
this place we will lay such a fine on you
as you will have small pleasure in paying
enough make no excuses they are not asked
now and another time they will not be admitted
know sirs that our reverend clerk hath
taken down in writing and at full length what
i will tell you in brief that you may see what
is to be required you henry smith in particular
our late fellowcitizen oliver proudfate
hath been found dead in the high street
close by the entrance into the wynd it seemeth
he was slain by a heavy blow with a short axe
dealt from behind and at unawares and the act
bv which he fell can only be termed a deed 
foul and forethoiiglit murder so much for the
crime the criminal can only be indicated hy
circumstances it is recorded in the protocol 
the reverend sir louis lundin that divers
wellreputed witnesses saw our deceased citizen
oliver proudfute till a late period accompanying
the entry the morrisdancers whom
he was one as far as the house simon glover
in curfew street where they again played
their pageant it is also manifested that at
this place he separated from the rest the
band after some discourse with simon glover
and made an appointment to meet with the
others his company at the sign the griffin
there to conclude the holiday now simon
i demand you whether this be truly stated
so far as you know and further what was the
purport the defunct oliver proudfute's discourse
with you 
 my lord provost and very worshipful sir
patrick answered simon glover you and
this honourable council shall know that touching
certain reports which had been made ie
conduct henry smith some quarrel lead

arisen between myself and another my family
and the said smith here present now
this our poor fellowcitizen oliver proudfute
having been active in spreading these reports
as indeed his element lay in such gossipred
some words passed betwixt him and me on the
subject and as i think he left me with the
purpose visiting henry smith for he broke
off from the morrisdancers promising as it
seems to meet them as your honour has said
at the sign the griffin in order to conclude
the evening but what he actually did i know
not as i never again saw him in life
it is enough said sir patrick and agrees
with all that we have heard now worthy sirs
we next find our poor fellowcitizen environed
by a set revellers and maskers who had assembled
in the high street by whom he was
shamefully ill treated being compelled to kneel
down in the street and there to quaff huge
quantities liquor against his inclination until
at length he escaped from them by flight this
violence was accomplished with drawn swords
loud shouts and imprecations so as to attract the
attention several persons who alarmed by
the tumult looked out from their windows as
well as one or two passengers who keeping
aloof from the light the torches lest they also
had been maltreated beheld the usage which
our fellowcitizen received in the high street 
the burgh and although these revellers were
disguised and used zads yet their disguises
were well known being a set quaint masking
habits prepared some weeks ago by command
 sir john ramorny master the
horse to his royal highness the duke rothsay
prince royal scotland
a low groan went through the assembly
yes so it is brave burghers continued sir
patrick our inquiries have led us into conclusions
both melancholy and terrible but as
no one can regret the point at which they seem
likely to arrive more than i do so no mau living
can dread its consequences less it is even so
various artisans employed upon the articles
have described the dresses prepared for sir john
jlamornv's mask as beinjr exactly similar to
those oi the men by whom oliver proudtutc was
observed to be maltreated and one mechanic
being whitfield the featherdresser who saw
the revellers when they had our fellowcitizen
within their hands remarked that they wore
the cincture and coronals painted feathers
which he himself had made by the order the
prince's master the horse
after the moment his escape from these
revellers we lose all trace oliver but we
can prove that the maskers went to sir john
ramorny's where they were admitted after
some show delay it is rumoured that thou
henry smith safest our unhappy fellowcitizen
after he had been in the hands these revellers
 what is the truth that matter 
he came to my house in she wynd said
henry about half an hour before midnight 
and i admitted him something unwillingly ashe
had been keeping carnival while i remained
at home and there is ill talk says the proverb
betwixt a full man and a fasting
 and in which plight seemed he when thou
didst admit him said the provost
he seemed answered the smith out 
breath and talked repeatedly having been endangered
by revellers i paid but small regard
for he was ever a timorous chickenspirited
though wellmeaning man and i held that m
was speaking more from fancy than reality but
i shall always account it for foul offence in myself
that i did not give him my company which
he requested and if i live i will found masses
for his soul in expiation my guilt
did he describe those from whom he received
the injury said the provost
revellers in masking habits replied henry
 and did he intimate his fear having todo
with them on his return again demanded
sir patrick
he alluded particularly to his being waylaid
which i treated as visionary having been
able to see no one in the lane
had he then no help from thee any kind
whatsoever said the provost
yes worshipful replied the smith he
exchanged his morris dress for my headpiece
buffcoat and target which i hear were found
iipou his body and have at home his morricc
cap and bells with the jerkin and other things
pertaining he was to return my garb fence
and get back his own masking suit this day had
the saints so permitted
 you saw him not then afterwards 
 never my lord
one word more said the provost have
you any reason to think that the blow which
slew oliver proudfute was meant for another
man 
i have answered the smith but it is
doubtful and may be dangerous to add such a
conjecture which is besides only a supposition
speak it out on your burgher faith and oath
for whom think you was the blow meant 
 if i must speak replied henry i believe
oliver proudfute received the fate which was
designed for myself the rather that in his folly
oliver spoke trying to assume my manner 
walking as well as my dress
 have you feud with any one that you form
such an idea said sir patrick charters
 to my shame and sin be it spoken ha c
loud whli iligliland and lowland english and
scot perth and angus i do not believe poor
oliver had feud with a newhatched chicken 
alas he was the more fully prepared for a sudden
call 
 hark ye smith said the provost answer
me distinctly is there cause feud between
the household sir john ramorny and
yourself
to a certainty my lord there is it is now
generally said that black quentin who went
over tay to fife some days since was the owner
 the hand which was found in couvrefew
street upon the eve st valentine it was i
who struck off that hand with a blow my
broadsword as this black quentin was a
chamberlain sir john and much trusted it
is like there must be feud between me and his
master's dependents
it bears a likely front smith said sir patrick
charteris and now good brothers and
wise magistrates there are two suppositions
each which leads to the same conclusion the
makerswho seized our fellow citizen and misused
liii in a manner which his body retains
some slight marks may have met with their
former prisoner as he returned homewards and
finished their ill usage by taking his life he
himself expressed to henry gow fears that this
would be the case if this be really true one
or more sir john ramorny's attendants
must have been the assassins but i think it
more likely that one or two the revellers may
have remained on the field or returned to it
having changed perhaps their disguise and that
to those men for oliver proudfute in his own
personal appearance would only have been a
subject sport his apparition in the dress and
assuming as he proposed to do the manner
 henry smith was matter deep hatred
and that seeing him alone they had taken as
they thought a certain and safe mode to rid
themselves an enemy so dangerous as all men
know henry wynd is accounted by those that
are his friends the same train reasoning
again rests the guilt with the household sir
john ramorny how think you siis are
we not free to charge the crime upon them 
the magistrates whispered together for several
minutes and then replied by the voice 
bailie craigdallie noble knight and our
worthy provost we agree entirely in what
your wisdom has spoken concerning this dark
and bloody matter nor do we doubt your sagacity
in tracing to the fellowship and the company
 john ramorny that ilk the villainy
which hath been done to our deceased fellowcitizen
whether in his own character and capacity
or as mistaking him for our brave townsman
henry the wynd but sir john in his
own behalf and as the prince's master the
horse maintains an extensive household and
as course the charge will be rebutted by a denial
we would ask how we shall proceed in that
case it is true could we find law for firing
the lodging and putting all within it to the
sword the old proverb short rede good
rede might here apply for a fouler household
 defiers god destroyers men and debauchery
 women are nowhere sheltered than
are in ramorny's band but i doubt that this
summary mode execution would scarce be
burne out by the laws and no tittle evidence
which i have heard will tend to fix the crime
on any single individual or individuals
before the provost could reply the townclerk
arose and stroking his venerable beard
craved permission to speak which was instantly
granted brethren he said as well in
our fathers time as ours hath god on being
rightly appealed to condescended to make manifest
the crimes the guilty and the innocence
 those who may have been rashly accused
let us demand from our sovereign lord king
robert who when the wicked do not interfere
to pervert his good intentions is as just and
clement a prince as our annals can show in
their long line in the name the fair city and
 all the commons in scotland that he give us
after the fashion our ancestors the means 
appealing to heaven for light upon this dark
murder we will demand the proof by hierrights
often granted in the days our sovereign's
ancestors approved by bulls and decretals
and administered by the great emperor
charlemagne in france by king artlinr in
britain and by gregory the great and the
mighty aclriius in this our land scotland
i have heard the bierright sir louis
fjuoth the provost and i know we have it in
our charters the fail city but i am something
illlearned in the ancient laws and would
pray you to inform us more distinctly its nature

 we will demand the king said sir
louis lundin my advice being taken that the
body our murdered fellowcitizen be transported
into the high church st john's and
suitable masses said for the benefit his soul
and for the discovery his foul murder meantime
we shall obtain an order that sir john ramorn
give up a list such his household
as were in perth in the course the night between
fastern's even and this ash wednesday
and become bound to present them on a certain
day and hour to be early named in the high
church st john's there one by one to pass
before the bier our murdered fellow citizen
and in trio form prescribed to call upon god and
his saints to bear witness that he is innocent 
the acting art or part the murder and
credit me as has been indeed proved by numerous
instances that if the murderer shall endeavour
to shroud himself by making such an appeal
the antipathy which subsists between the
dead body and the hand which dealt the fatal
blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken
some imperfect life under the influence which
the veins the dead man will pour forth at the
fatal wounds the blood which has been so long
stagnant in the veins or to speak more certainly
it is the pleasure heaven by some
hidden agency which we cannot comprehend to
leave open this mode discovering the wickedness
 him who has defaced the image his
creator
i have heard this law talked said sir
patrick and it was enforced in the bruce's
time this surely is no unfit period to seek by
such a mystic mode inquiry the truth to
which no ordinary means can give us access
seeing that a general accusation sir john's
household would full surely be met by a general
denial yet i must crave farther sir
louis our reverend townclerk how we shall
prevent the guilty person from escaping in the
interim 
 the burghers will maintain a strict watch
upon the wall drawbridges shall be raised
and portcullises lowered from sunset to sunrise
and strong patrols maintained through the
night this guard the burghers will willingly
maintain to secure against the escape the
murderer their townsman
the rest the councillors acquiesced byword
sign and look in this proposal
again said the provost what if anyone
 the suspected household refuse to submit
to the ordeal bierright 
he may appeal to that combat said
the reverend city scribe with an opponent
 equal rank because the accused person must
have his choice in the appeal to the judgment
 god by what ordeal he will be tried but
if he refuses both he must be held as guilty
and so punished
the sages the council unanimously agreed
with the opinion their provost and townclerk
and resolved in all formality to petition
the king as a matter right that the murder
 their fellowcitizen should be inquired into
according to this ancient form which was held
to manifest the truth and received as matter 
evidence in case murder so late as towards
the the seventeenth century but before
the meeting dissolved bailie craigdallie thought
it meet to inquire who was to be the champion
 maudie or magdalen proudfute and her
two children
 there need be little inquiry about that
said sir patrick charteris we are men and
wear swords which should be broken over the
head any one amongst us who will not draw
it in behalf the widow and orphans our
murdered fellowcitizen and in brave revenge
 his death if sir john ramorny shall personally
resent the inquiry patrick charteris 
kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance
whilst horse and man may stand or spear
and blade hold together but in case the challenger
be yeomanly degree well wot i that
magdalen proudfute may choose her own champion
among the bravest burghers perth and
shame and dishonour were it to the fair city
for ever could she light upon one who was traitor
and coward enough to say her nay bring
her hither that she may make her election
henry smith heard this with a melancholy
anticipation that the poor woman's choice would
light upon him and that his recent reconciliation
with his mistress would be again dissolved
by his being engaged in a fresh quarrel from
which there lay no honourable means escape
and which in any other circumstances
he would have welcomed as a glorious opportunity
 distinguishing himself both in sight 
the court and the city he was aware that
under the tuition father clement catharine
viewed the ordeal battle rather as an
insult to religion than an appeal to the deity
and did not consider it as reasonable that superior
strength arm or skill weapon
should be resorted to as the proof moral
vol 
guilt or innocence he had therefore much
to fear from her peculiar opinions in this particular
refined as they were beyond those 
the age she lived in
while he thus suffered under these contending
feelings magdalen the widow the slaughtered
man entered the court wrapt in a deep mourning
veil and followed and supported by five or
six women good that is respectability
dressed in the same melancholy attire one 
her attendants held an infant in her arms the
last pledge poor oliver's nuptial affections
another led a little tottering creature two
years or thereabouts which looked with wonder
and fear sometimes on the black dress in
which they had muffled him and sometimes on
the scene around him
the assembly rose to receive the melancholy
group and saluted them with an expression 
the deepest sympathy which magdalen though
the mate poor oliver returned with an air
 dignity which she borrowed perhaps from
the extremity her distress sir patrick charters
then stepped forward and with the courtesy
 a knight to a female and a protector
to an oppressed and injured widow took the poor
woman's hand and explained to her briefly by
what course the city had resolved to follow out
the vengeance due for her husband's slaughter
having with a softness and gentleness which
did not belong to his general manner ascertained
that the unfortunate woman perfectly
understood what was meant he said aloud to the
assembly goodcitizensof perth and freeborn
men guild and craft attend to what is about
to pass foritconcerns your rights and privileges
here stands magdalen proudfute desirous to
follow forth the revenge due for the death 
her husband foully murdered as she sayeth
by sir john ramorny knight that ilk and
which she offers to prove by the evidence 
bierright or by the body a man therefore
i patrick charteris being a belted knight and
freeborn gentleman offer myself to do battle
in her just quarrel whilst man and horse may
endure if any one my degree shall lift my
glove how say you magdalen proudfute
will you accept me for your champion 
the widow answered with difficulty i
can desire none nobler
sir patrick then took her right hand in his
and kissing her forehead for such was the
ceremony said solemnly so may god
and st john prosper me at my need as i will
do my devoir as your champion knightly
truly and manfully go now magdalen and
choose at your will among the burgesses the
fair city present or absent anyone upon whom
you desire to rest your challenge if he against
whom you bring plaint shall prove to be beneath
my degree
all eyes were turned to henry smith whom
the general voice had already pointed out as in
every respect the fittest to act as champion on
the occasion but the widow waited not for the
general prompting their looks as soon as
sir patrick had spoken she crossed the floor to
the place where near the bottom the table
the armourer stood among the men his degree
and took him by the hand 
henry gow or smith she said good
burgher and craftsman my my 
husband she would have said but the word
would not come forth she was obliged to
change the expression
he who is gone loved and prized you overall
men therefore meet it is that thou shouldst
follow out the quarrel his widow and orphans

if there had been a possibility which in that
age there was not henry's rejecting or escaping
from a trust for which all men seemed
to destine him every wish and idea retreat
was cut off when the widow began to address
him and a command from heaven could hardly
have made a stronger impression than did the
appeal the unfortunate magdalen her allusion
to his intimacy with the deceased moved
him to the soul during oliver's life doubtless
there had been a strain absurdity in his
excessive predilection for henry which considering
how very different they were in character
had in it something ludicrous but all this
was now forgotten and henry giving way to
his natural ardour only remembered that oliver
had been his friend and intimate a man
who had loved and honoured him as much as he
was capable entertaining such sentiments for
any one and above all that there was much reason
to suspect that the deceased had fallen victim
to a blow meant for henry himself
it was therefore with an alacrity which the
minute before he could scarce have commanded
and which seemed to express a stern pleasure
that having pressed his lips to the cold
brow the unhappy magdalen the armourer
replied 
i henry the smith dwelling in the wynd
 perth good man and true and freely born
accept the office champion to this widow
magdalen and these orphans and will do battle
in their quarrel to the death with any man
whomsoever my own degree and that so long
as i shall draw breath so help me at my need
god and good st john 
there rose from the audience a half suppressed
cry expressing the interest which the persons
present took in the prosecution the quarrel
and their confidence in the issue
sir patrick charteris then took measures for
repairing to the king's presence and demanding
leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder
 oliver proudfute according to the custom
 bierright and if necessary by combat
he performed this duty after the towncouncil
had dissolved in a private interview between
himself and the king who heard this new
trouble with much vexation and appointed next
morning after mass for sir patrick and the
parties interested to attend his pleasure in
council in the meantime a royal pursuivant
was dispatched to the constable's lodgings to
call over the roll sir john ramorny's attendants
and charge him with his whole retinue
under high penalties to abide within perth
until the king's pleasure should be farther
known
chapter 
in goa'h name see the lists and all things fit 
there let them it god defend the right 
henri part 
in the same councilroom the conventual
palace the dominicans king robert was
seated with his brother albany whose affected
austerity virtue and real art and dissimulation
maintained so high an influence over the
feebleminded monarch it was indeed natural
that one who seldom saw things according to
their real forms and outlines should view them
according to the light in which they were presented
to him by a bold studious man possessing
the claim such near relationship
ever anxious on account his misguided
and unfortunate son the king was now endeavouring
to make albany coincide in opinion
with him in exculpating rothsay from any part
in the death the bonnetmaker the precognition
concerning which had been left by sir
patrick charteris for his majesty's consideration

this is an unhappy matter brother robin
he said a most unhappy occurrence and
goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the
nobility and the commons here as they have
been at war together in so many distant lands
i see but one cause comfort in the matter 
and that is that sir john ramorny having received
his dismissal from the duke rothsay's
family it cannot be said that he or any his
people who may have done this bloody deed if
it has truly been done by them have been encouraged
or hounded out upon such an errand
by my poor robin i am sure brother you and
i can bear witness how readily upon my entreaties
he agreed to dismiss ramorny from
his service on account that brawl in curfew
street
i remember his doing so said albany
and well do i hope that the connexion betwixt
the prince and ramorny has not been
renewed since he seemed to comply with your
grace's wishes
seemed to comply the connexion renewed
said the king what mean you by
these expressions brother surely when robin
promised to me that if that unhappy matter
 curfew street were but smothered up
and concealed he would part with ramorny
as he was a counsellor thought capable involving
him in similar fooleries and would acquiesce
in our inflicting on him either exile or
such punishment as it should please us to impose
 surely you cannot doubt that he was sincere
in his professions and would keep his
word remember you not that when you advised
that a heavy fine should be levied upon
his estate in fife in lieu banishment the
prince himself seemed to say that exile would
be better for ramorny and even for himself 
i remember it well my royal brother
nor truly could i have suspected ramorny 
having so much influence over the prince after
having been accessary to placing him in a situation
so perilous had it not been for my royal
kinsman's own confession alluded to by your
grace that if suffered to remain at court he
might still continue to direct his conduct i
then regretted i had advised a fine in place 
exile but that time is passed and now new
mischief has occurred fraught with much peril
to your majesty as well as to your royal heir
and to the whole kingdom
what mean you robin said the weakminded
king by the tomb our parents 
by the soul bruce our immortal ancestor 
i entreat thee my dearest brother to take compassion
on me tell me what evil threatens
my son or my kingdom 
the features the king trembling with
anxiety and his eyes brimful tears were
bent upon his brother who seemed to assume
time for consideration ere he replied
my lord the danger lies here your grace
believes that the prince had no accession to this
second aggression upon the citizens perth 
the slaughter this bonnetmaking fellow
about whose death they clamour as a set 
gulls about tlmjir comrade when one the
noisy brood is struck down by a boy's shaft
their lives said the king are dear to
themselves and their friends robin
truly ay my liege and they make them
dear to us too ere we can settle with the knaves
for the least blood witt but as i said your
majesty thinks the prince had no share in this
last slaughter i will not attempt to shake your
belief in that delicate point but will endeavour
to believe along with you what you think is
rule for me robin albany will never think
otherwise than robin broad scotland
thank you thank you said the king taking
his brother's hand i knew i might rely
that your affection would do justice to poor
heedless rothsay who exposes himself to so
much misconstruction that he scarcely deserves
the sentiments you feel for him
albany had such an immovable constancy
 purpose that he was able to return the fraternal
pressure the king's hand while tearing
up by the very roots the hopes the indulgent
fond old man
 but alas the duke continued with a sigh
this burly intractable knight kinfauns
and his brawling herd burghers will not
view the matter as we do they have the boldness
to say that this dead fellow had been misused
by rothsay and his fellows who were in
the street in mask and revel stopping men and
women compelling them to dance or to drink
huge quantities wine with other follies needless
to recount and they say that the whole
party repaired to sir john ramorny's and
broke their way into the house in order to conclude
their revel there thus affording good
reason to judge that the dismissal sir john
from the prince's service was but a feigned
stratagem to deceive the public and hence
they urge that if ill were done that night by
sir john ramorny or his followers much it is
to be thought that the duke rothsay must
have at least been privy to if he did not authorize
it
albany this is dreadful said the king 
would they make a murderer my boy 
would they pretend my son would soil his hands
ill scottish blood without having either provocation
or purpose no no they will not invent
calumnies so broad as these for they are
flagrant and incredible
pardon my liege answered the duke 
albany they say the cause quarrel which
occasioned the riot in curfew street and the
consequences was more proper to the prince
than to sir john since none suspects far less
believes that that hopeful enterprise was conducted
for the gratification the knight 
ramorny
thou drives me mad robin said the
king
i am dumb answered his brother i
did but speak my poor mind according to your
royal order
thou meanest well i know said the
king but instead tearing me to pieces
with the display inevitable calamities were
it not kinder robin to point me out some mode
to escape from them 
true my liege but as the only road 
extrication is rough and difficult it is necessary
your grace should be first possessed with the
absolute necessity using it ere you hear it
even described the chirurgeon must first convince
his patient the incurable condition 
a shattered member ere he venture to name
amputation though it be the only remedy
robert at these words was roused to a degree
 alarm and indignation greater than his
brother had deemed he could be awakened to
 shattered and mortified member my lord
 albany amputation the only remedy 
these are unintelligible words my lord if
thou applies them to our son roth say thou
must make them good to the letter else mayst
thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence
you construe me too literally my royal
liege said albany i spoke not the prince
in such unbeseeming terms for i call heaven
to witness that he is dearer to me as the son 
a wellbeloved brother than had he been son
 my own but i spoke in regard to separating
him from the follies and vanities life
which holy men say are like to mortified member's
and ought like them to be cut off and
thrown from us as things which interrupt our
progress in better things
i understand thou wouldst have this ramorn
who hath been thought the instrument
 my son's follies exiled from court said the
relieved monarch until these unhappy scandals
are forgotten and our subjects are disposed
to look upon our son with different and
more confiding eyes
that were good counsel my liege but
mine went a little a very little farther i
would have the prince himself removed for
some brief period from court
how albany part with my child my
firstborn the light my eyes and wilful ashe
is the darling my heart oh robin 
i cannot and i will not
nay i did but suggest my lord i am sensible
 the wound such a proceeding must inflict
on a parentis heart for am i not myself a
father and he hung his head as if in hopeless
despondency
i could not survive it albany when i
think that even our own influence over him
which sometimes forgotten in our absence u
ever effectual whilst he is with us is by your
plan to be entirely removed what perils might
he not rush upon i could not sleep in his absence
 i should hear his deathgroan in every
breeze and you albany though you conceal
it better would be nearly as anxious
thus spoke the facile monarch willing to
conciliate his brother and cheat himself by taking
it for granted that an affection which
there were no traces subsisted betwixt the uncle
and nephew
your paternal apprehensions are too easily
alarmed my lord said albany i do not
propose to leave the disposal the prince's motions
to his own wild pleasure i understand
that the prince is to be placed for a short time
under some becoming restraint that he should
be subjected to the charge some grave counsellor
who must be responsible both for this conduct
and his safety as a tutor for his pupil
how a tutor and at rothsay's age
vol r
exclaimed the king he is two years beyond
the space to which our laws limit the term 
nonage
 the wiser romans said albany extended
it for four years after the period we assign
 and in common sense the right control
ought to last till it be no longer necessary
and so the time ought to vary with the disposition
here is young lindsay the earl crawford
who they say gives patronage to ramorny
on this appeal he is a lad fifteen with the
deep passions and fixed purpose a man 
thirty while my royal nephew with much more
amiable and noble qualities both head and
heart sometimes shows at twentythree years
 age the wanton humours a boy towards
whom restraint may be kindness and do not
be discouraged that it is so my liege or angry
with your brother for telling the truth since the
best fruits are those that are slowest in ripening
and the best horses such as give most trouble
to the grooms who train them for the field
or lists
the duke stopped and after suffering king
robert to indulge for two or three minutes in a
reverie wliieli lie did not attempt to interrupt
he added in a more lively tone but cheer
up my noble liege perhaps the feud may be
made up without farther fighting or difficulty
the widow is poor for her husband though he
was much employed had idle and costly habits
the matter may be therefore redeemed for money
and the amount an assythment may be
recovered out ramorny's estate
 nay that we will ourselves discharge
said king robert eagerly catching at the hope
 a pacific termination this unpleasing debate
 ramorny's prospects vill be destroyed
by his being sent from court and deprived 
his charge in rothsay's household and it would
be ungenerous to load a falling man but here
comes our secretary the prior to tell us the
hour council approaches good morrow my
worthy father
benedicite my royal liege answered the
abbot
now good father continued the king
 a mulct in atonement for bloodshed due to the nearest relations
 the deceased
 without waiting for rotlisay whose accession
to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee
proceed we to the business our kingdom
what advices have you from the douglas

he has arrived at his castle pantaloon
my liege and has sent a post to say that though
the earl march remains in sullen seclusion
in his fortress dunbar his friends and followers
are gathering and forming an encampment
near nottingham where it is supposed
they intend to await the arrival a large force
 english which hotspur and sir ralph percy
are assembling on the english frontier
that is cold news said the king and
may god forgive george dunbar the
prince entered as he spoke and he continued 
ha thou art here at length rothsay i saw
thee not at mass
i was an idler this morning said the
prince having spent a restless and feverish
night
ah foolish boy answered the kinghadst
thou not been over restless on eastern's
eve thou last not been feverish on the
night ash wednesday
let me not interrupt your prayers my
liege said the prince lightly your grace
was invoking heaven in behalf some one 
an enemy doubtless for these have the frequent
advantage your orisons
sit down and be at peace foolish youth 
said his father his eye resting at the same time
on the handsome face and graceful figure his
favourite son roth say drew a cushion near to
his father's feet and threw himself carelessly
down upon it while the king resumed
i was regretting that the earl march
having separated warm from my hand with full
assurance that he should receive compensation
for everything which he could complain as
injurious should have been capable caballing
with northumberland against his own country 
is it possible he could doubt our intentions to
make good our word 
i will answer for him no said the prince 
march never doubted your highness's word
aviary he may well have made question whether
your learned councillors would leave your majesty
the power keeping it
robert the third had adopted to a great extent
the timid policy not seeming to hear expressions
which being heard required even in
his own eyes some display displeasure he
passed on therefore in his discourse without
observing his son's speech but in private rothsay's
rashness augmented the displeasure which
his father began to entertain against him
it is well the douglas is on the marches
said the king his breast like those his
ancestors has ever been the best bulwark 
scotland
 then woe betide us if he should turn his
back said the incorrigible rothsay
 dare you impeach the courage douglas
 replied the king extremely chafed
 no man dare question the earl's courage
said rothsay it is certain as his pride but
his luck may be something doubted else have
the annals his house given him the name 
tineman for nothing
t'lnc'vuni i c loseman
 by saint andrew robin exclaimed his
father thou art like a screechowl every word
thou mayest betokens strife and calamity
i am silent father answered the youth
and what news our highland disturbances
continued the king addressing the
prior
i trust they have assumed a favourable
aspect answered the clergyman the fire
which threatened the whole country is likely to
be drenched out by the blood some forty or
fifty kerne for the two great confederacies have
agreed i y solemn indenture arms to decide
their quarrel with such weapons as your highness
may name and in your royal presence in
such place as shall be appointed on the th 
march next to come being palm sunday the
number combatants being limited to thirty on
each side and the fight to be maintained to extremity
since they affectionately make humble
suit and petition to your majesty that you will
parentally condescend to wave for the day your
royal privilege interrupting the combat by
flinging down uf truncheon or crying ho 

until the battle shall be utterly fought to an

 the wild savages exclaimed the king 
would they limit our best and dearest royal
privilege that putting a stop to strife and
crying truce to battle will they remove the
only motive which could bring me to the butcherly
spectacle their combat would they
fight like men or like their own mountain
wolves 
my lord said albany the earl 
crawford and i had presumed without consulting
you to ratify that preliminary for the
adoption which we saw much and pressing
reason
how the earl crawford said the
king me thinks he is a young counsellor on
such grave occurrence
he is replied albany notwithstanding
his early years such esteem among his highland
neighbours that i could have done little
with them but for his aid and influence
hear this young rothsay said the king
reproachfully to his heir
i pity crawford sire replied the prince
he has too early lost a father whose councils
would have better become such a season as
this
the king turned next towards albany with
a look triumph at the filial affection which
his son displayed in his reply
albany proceeded without emotion it is
not the life these highlander but their
death which is to be profitable to this commonwealth
 scotland and truly it seemed to the
earl crawford and myself most desirable
that the combat should be a strife extermination

marry said the prince if such be the
juvenile policy lindsay he will be a merciful
ruler some ten or twelve years hence out
upon a boy that is hard heart before he has
hair upon his lip better he had contented himself
with fighting cocks on pastern's even than
laying schemes for massacring men on palm
sunday as if he were backing a welsh main
where all must fight to death
 robin says right albany said the king
 it were unlike a christian monarch to gie
way in this point i cannot consent to see men
battle until they are all hewn down like cattle
in the shambles it would sicken me to look at
it and the warder would drop from ray hand
for mere lack strength to hold it
it would drop unheeded said albany
 let me entreat your grace to recollect that
you only give up a royal privilege which exercised
would win you no respect since it would
receive no obedience were your majesty to
throw down your warder when the war is high
and these men's blood is hot it would meet no
more regard than if a sparrow should drop
among a herd battling wolves the straw which
he was carrying to his nest nothing will separate
them but the exhaustion slaughter 
and better they sustain it at the hands each
other than from the swords such troops as
might attempt to separate them at your majesty's
commands an attempt to keep the peace
by violence would be construed into an ambush
laid for them both parties would unite to resist
it the slaughter would be the same and the
g
hopedfor results future peace would be utterly
disappointed
there is even too much truth in what you
say brother robin replied the flexible king
to little purpose is it to command what i cannot
enforce and although i have the unhappiness
to do so each day my life it were needless
to give such a public example royal impotency
before the crowds who may assemble to
behold this spectacle let these savage men
therefore work their bloody will to the uttermost
upon each other i will not attempt to forbid
what i cannot prevent them from executing
 heaven help this wretched country i
will to my oratory and pray for her since to
aid her by hand and head is alike denied to me
father prior i pray the support your arms
but brother said albany forgive
me if i remind you that we must hear the matter
between the citizens perth and ramoruy
about the death a townsman 
true true said the monarch reseating
himself more violence more battle oh
scotland scotland if the best blood thy
g
bravest children could enrich thy barren soil
what land on earth would excel thee in fertility
 when is it that a white hair is seen on the
beard a scottish man unless he be some
wretch like thy sovereign protected from murder
by impotence to witness the scenes 
slaughter to which he cannot put a period 
let them come in delay them not they are
in haste to kill and grudge each other each fresh
breath their creator's blessed air the demon
 strife and slaughter hath possessed the
whole land 
as the mild prince threw himself back on
his seat with an air impatience and anger
not very usual with him the door at the lower
 the room was unclosed and advancing
from the gallery into which it led where in perspective
was seen a guard the butemen or
brandanes under arms came in mournful
procession the widow poor oliver led by sir
patrick charteris with as much respect as if
she had been a lady the first rank behind
them came two women good the wives 
magistrates the city both in mourning garments
one bearing the infant and the other
leading the elder child the smith followed in
his best attire and wearing over his buffcoat
a scarf crape bailie craigdallie and a brother
magistrate closed the mournful procession
exhibiting similar marks mourning
the good king's transitory passion was gone
the instant he looked on the pallid countenance
 the sorrowing widow and beheld the unconsciousness
 the innocent orphans who had
sustained so great a loss and when sir patrick
charteris had assisted magdalen proudfute to
kneel down and still holding her hand kneeled
himself on one knee it was with a sympathetic
tone that king robert asked her name
and business she made no answer but muttered
something looking towards her conductor
speak for the poor woman sir patrick
charteris said the king and tell us the
cause her seeking our presence
so please you my liege answered sir
patrick rising up this woman and these unhappy
orphans make plaint to your highness
upon sir john ramorny ramorny knight
that by lii or by some his household lier
iimquhile husband oliver proudfute freeman
and burgess perth was slain upon the streets
 the city on the eve shrove tuesday or
morning ash wednesday
woman replied the king with much
kindness thou art gentle by sex and should'st
be pitiful even by thy affliction for our own
calamity ought to make us nay i think it doth
make us merciful to others thy husband hath
only trodden the path appointed to us all
 in his case said the widow my liege
must remember it has been a brief and a bloody
one
 i agree he hath had foul measure but
since i have been unable to protect him as i
confess was my royal duty i am willing in
atonement to support thee and these orphans
as well or better than you lived in the days 
your husband only do thou pass from this
charge and be not the occasion spilling more
life remember i put before you the choice
betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance
and that betwixt plenty and pcnurv
it is true my liege we arc poor answer 
ed the widow with unshaken firmness but
i and my children will feed with the beasts 
the field ere we live on the price my husband's
blood i demand the combat by my
champion as you are belted knight and crowned
king
i knew it would be so said the king
aside to albany in scotland the first words
stammered by an infant and the last uttered
by a dying greybeard are combat blood 
revenge it skills not arguing further admit
the defendants
sir john ramorny entered the apartment
he was dressed in a long furred robe such as
men quality wore when they were unarmed
concealed by the folds drapery his wounded
arm was supported by a scarf or sling 
crimson silk and with the left arm he leaned
on a youth who scarcely beyond the years 
boyhood bore on his brow the deep impression
 early thought and premature passion this
was that celebrated lindsay earl crawford
who in his after days was known by the epithet
 the tiger earl and who ruled the great and
rich valley stratford with the absolute
power and unrelenting cruelty a feudal tyrant
two or three gentlemen friends the earl or
 his own countenanced sir john ramorny
by their presence on this occasion the charge
was again stated and met by a broad denial on
the part the accused and in reply the challengers
offered to prove their assertion by an
appeal to the ordeal bierright
i am not bound answered sir john ramorn
 to submit to this ordeal since i can
prove by the evidence my late royal master
that i was in my own lodgings lying on my
bed ill at ease while this provost and these
bailies pretend i was committing a crime to
which i had neither will nor temptation i
can therefore be no just object suspicion
i can aver said the prince that i saw
and conversed with sir john ramorny about
some matters concerning my own household on
the very night when this murder was adoing
i therefore know that he was ill at ease and
could not in person commit the deed in question
but i know nothing the employment
 his attendants and will not take it upon me
to say that some one them may not have been
guilty the crime now charged on them
sir john ramorny had during the beginning
 this speech looked round with an air 
defiance which was somewhat disconcerted by
the concluding sentence rothsay's speech
i thank your highness he said with a smile
for your cautious and limited testimony in my
behalf he was wise who wrote put not your
faith in princes 
if you have no other evidence your innocence
sir john ramorny said the king
 we may not in respect to your followers refuse
to the injured widow and orphans the complainers
the grant a proof by ordeal bierright
unless any them should prefer that 
combat for yourself you are by the prince's
evidence freed from the attaint
my liege answered sir john i can take
warrant upon myself for the innocence my
household and followers
wliy so a monk or a woman might speak
roi n s

said sir patrick charters iii knightly language
wilt thou sir holm de ramorny do battle
with me in the behalf thy followers 
 the provost perth had not obtained time
lo name the word combat said ramorny ere
i would have accepted it but i am not at present
fit to hold a lance
 i am glad it under your favour sir
john there will be the less bloodshed said
the king you must therefore produce your
followers according to your steward's household
 in the great church st john's that in
presence all whom it may concern they may
purge themselves this accusation see that
every man them do appear at the time 
high mass otherwise your honour may be sorely
tainted
they shall attend to a man said sir john
ramcrny then bowing low to the king he
directed himself to the young duke rothsay
and making a deep obeisance spoke so as
to be heard by him alone you have used
me generously my lord one word your
lips could have ended this controversy and you
have refused to speak it 

on my life whispered the prince i
spake as far as the extreme verge truth and
conscience would permit i think thou could'st
not expect i should frame lies for thee and after
all john in my broken recollections that
night i do bethink me a butcherlylooking
mute with a curtalaxe much like such a one
as may have done yonder nightjob ha have
i touched you sir knight 
ramorny made no answer but turned away
as precipitately as if some one had pressed suddenly
on his wounded arm and regained his
lodgings with the earl crawford to whom
though disposed for anything rather than revelry
he was obliged to offer a splendid collation
to acknowledge in some degree his sense the
countenance which the young noble had afforded
him
chapter x
when after an entertainment the prolonging
 which was like torture to the wounded
knight the earl crawford at length took
horse to go to his distant quarters in the castle
 dublin where he resided as a guest the
knight ramorny retired into his sleeping
apartment agonized pains body and anxiety
 mind here he found henbane dwining on
whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation
in both respects the physician with his
affectation extreme humility hoped he saw
his exalted patient merry and happy
merry as a mad dog said ramorny and
happy as the wretch whom the cur hath bitten
and who begins to feel the approach 
the ravening madness that ruthless boy saw
my agony and spared not a single carouse i
must do him justice forsooth if i had done
justice to him and to the world i had thrown
him out window and cut short a career which
if he grow upas he has begun will prove a source
 misery to all scotland but especially to tayside
 take heed as thou undoes the ligatures
chirurgeon the touch a fly's wing on that
raw glowing stump were like a dagger to me
 fear not my noble patron said the leech
with a chuckling laugh enjoyment which he
vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone 
affected sensibility we will apply some fresh
balsam and he he he relieve your knightly
honour the irritation which you sustain so
firmly
firmly man said ramorny grinning
with pain i sustain it as i would the scorching
flames purgatory the bone seems made
 redhot iron thy greasy ointment will hiss
as it drops upon the wound and yet it is december's
ice compared to the feverfit my
mind 
i
we will first use our emollients upon the
body my noble patron said dwining and
then with your knighthood's permission your
servant will try his art on the troubled mind
though i fain hope even the mental pain also
may in some degree depend on the irritation 
the wound and that abated as i trust the corporeal
pangs will soon be perhaps the stormy
feelings the mind may subside themselves

henbane dwining said the patient as he
felt the pain his wound assuaged thou art
a precious and invaluable leech but some things
are beyond thy power thou canst stupid my
bodily sense this raging agony but thou
canst not teach me to bear the scorn the boy
whom i have brought up whom i loved dining
 for i did love him dearly love him 
the worst my ill deeds have been done to
flatter his vices and he grudged me a word 
his mouth when a word would have allayed this
cumber he smiled too i saw him smile when
yon paltry provost the companion and patron
 wretched burghers defied me whom this
heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms
ere i forget or forgive it thou thyself shalt
preach up the pardoning injuries and
then the care for tomorrow tbink'st thou
henbane d wining that in very reality the
wounds the slaughtered corpse will gape and
shed tears fresh blood at the murderer's approach

i cannot tell my lord save by report
said dwining which avouches the fiict
the brute bonthron said ramorny is
startled at the apprehension such a thing and
speaks being rather willing to stand the
combat what think'st thou he is a fellow
 steel
it is the armourer's trade to deal with
steel replied dwining
 were bonthron to fall it would little grieve
me said ramorny though i should miss
an useful hand
i well believe your lordship will not sorrow
as for that you lost last excuse my pleasantry
 he he he but what are the useful
properties this fellow bonthron 
 those a bulldog answered the knight 
he worries without barking
 you have no fear his coiitessiug said
the physician
who can tell what the dread approaching
death may do replied the patient he
has already shown a timorousness entirely alien
from his ordinary sullenness nature he that
would scarce wash his hands after he had slain a
man is now afraid to see a dead body bleed
 well said the leech i must do somewhat
for him if i can since it was to further my
revenge that he struck yonder downright blow
though by ill luck it lighted not where it was
intended
and whose fault was that timid villain
said ramorny save thine own who marked
a rascal deer for a buck the first head 
benedicite noble sir replied the medicine
 would you have me who know little
save chamber practice be as skilful woodcraft
as your noble self or tell hart from hind
doe from roe in a glade at midnight i misdoubted
me little when i saw the figure run
past us to the smith's habitation in the wynd
habited like a morrisdancer and yet my mind
partly misgave me whether it was our man for
methought he seemed less stature but when
he came out again after so much time as to
change his dress and swaggered onwards with
buffcoat and steelcap whistling after the armourer's
wonted fashion i do own i was mistaken
and loosed your knighthood's hulldog
upon him who did his devoir most duly though
he pulled down the wrong deer therefore unless
the accursed smith kills our poor friend
stonedead on the spot i am determined if art
may do it that the bandog bonthron shall not
miscarry
it will put thine art to the test man 
medicine said ramorny for know that having
the worst the combat if our champion
be not killed stonedead in the lists he will be
drawn forth them by the heels and without
further ceremony knitted up to the gallows as
convicted the murder and when he hath
swung there like a loose tassel for an hour or so
i think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure
his broken neck
i am a different opinion may it please
your knighthood answered d wining gently
i will carry him off from the civ foot the
swallows
into the land faery like king arthur
or sir huon bordeaux or utero the
dane or will if i please suffer lii to dangle
on the gibbet for a certain number minutes
or hours and then whisk him away from
the sight all with as much ease as the wind
wafts away the withered leaf
this is idle boasting sir leech replied
ramorny the whole mob perth will attend
him to the gallows each more eager than
another to see the retainer a nobleman die for
the slaughter a cuckold citizen there will
be a thousand them round the gibbet's foot
and were there ten thousand said dining
 shall i who am a high clerk and have
studied in spain and araby itself not be able
to deceive the eyes this hoggish herd 
citizens when the pettiest juggler that ever
dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp observation
 your most intelligent knighthood 
i tell you i will put the change on them as if i
were in possession eddie's ring
if thou speaks truth answered the
knight and i think thou dearest not palter
with mo on such a theme thou must have tin
said
 satan and i will have nought to do with
him i disown and defy him
dwining indulged in his internal chuckling
laugh when he heard his patron testify his defiance
 the foul fiend and saw him second
it by crossing himself he composed himself
however upon observing ramorny's aspect become
very stern and said with tolerable gravity
though a little interrupted by the effort
necessary to suppress his mirthful mood 
confederacy most devout sir confederacy
is the soul jugglery but he he he i have
not the honour to be he he an ally the
gentleman whom you speak in whose existence
i am he he no very profound believer
though your knightship doubtless hath better
opportunities acquaintance
proceed rascal and without that sneer
which thou mayest otherwise dearly pay for
i will most undaunted replied dwining
know that i have my confederate too else
my skill were little worth
and who may that be pray you 
stephen smotherwcll if it like your boll

your hickman this fair city i marvel
your knighthood knows him not
 and i marvel thy knaveship knows him not
on professional acquaintance replied ramon
 but i see thy nose is unslit thy ears yet
cropped and if thy shoulders are scared or
branded thou art wise for using a highcollared
jerkin
he he your honour is pleasant said the
medicine it is not by personal circumstances
that i have acquired the intimacy 
stephen smotherwell but on account a certain
traffic betwixt us in which ant please you
i exchange certain sums silver for the bodies
heads and limbs those who die by aid 
friend stephen
wretch exclaimed the knight with horror
is it to compose charms and forward
works witchcraft that you trade for these
miserable relics mortality 
he he he no an it please your knightexecutioner
so called because one his dues consisted
in taking a small ladle full scottish lock meal out every
bashful exposed in the market
j
hood answered the medicine much amused
with the ignorance his patron but we who
are knights the scalpel are accustomed to
practise careful carving the limbs defunct

nay i do not recommend it to your knighthood

growling out some species confession different
from what we would recommend 
marry that can his medicine said d wining
 let me wait on him and lay but a
finger on his wound and trust me he shall betray
no confidence
a why there's a willing fiend that needs neither
pushing nor prompting said ramorny
as i trust i shall need neither in your
knighthood's service
we will go indoctrinate our agent continued
the knight we shall find him pliant 
for hound as he is he knows those who feed from
those who browbeat him and he holds a late
royal master mine in deep hate for some injurious
treatment and base terms which he received
at his hand i must also farther concert
with thee the particulars thy practice for
saving the bandog from the hands the herd
 citizens
we leave this worthy pair friends to their
secret practices which we shall afterwards seethe
results they were although different
s
qualities as well matched for device and execution
 criminal projects as the greyhound
is to destroy the game which the slowhound
raises or the slowhound to track the prey which
the gazehound discovers by the eye pride and
selfishness were the characteristics both but
from the difference rank education and talents
they had assumed the most different appearance
in the two individuals
nothing could less resemble the highblown
ambition the favourite courtier the successful
gallant and the bold warrior than the
submissive unassuming medicine who seemed
even to court and delight in insult whilst in
his secret soul he felt himself possessed a
superiority knowledge a power both 
science and mind which placed the rude
nobles the day infinitely beneath him so
conscious was henbane d wining this elevation
that like a keeper wild beasts he sometimes
adventured for his own amusement to
rouse the stormy passions such men as ramorn
trusting with his humble manner to
elude the turmoil he had excited as an italian
boy will launch his light canoe secure from
its very fragility upon a broken surf in wliicli
the boat an argosy would be assuredly dashed
to pieces that the feudal baron should despise
the humble practitioner in medicine was
a matter course but ramorny felt not the
less the influence which dwining exercised over
him and was in the encounter their wits often
mastered by him as the most eccentric efforts
 a fiery horse are overcome by a boy 
twelve years old if he has been bred to the arts
 the manege but the contempt dwining for
ramorny was far less qualified he regarded the
knight in comparison with himself as scarcely
rising above the brute creation capable indeed
 working destruction as the bull with his
horns or the wolf with his fangs but mastered
by mean prejudices and a slave to priestcraft
in which phrase dwining included religion
 every kind on the whole he considered
ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to
him as a serf to mine for the gold which he worshipped
and the avaricious love which was
his greatest failing though by no means his
worst vice he vindicated this sordid tenders
 t
cy in bis own eyes by persuading himself but
it had its source in the love power
henbane dwining he said as he gazed
in delight upon the hoards which he had secretly
amassed and which he visited from time to
time is no silly miser that doats on those
pieces for their golden lustre it is the power
with which they endow the possessor which
makes him thus adore them what is there that
these put not within your command do you
love beauty and are mean deformed infirm
and old here is a lure the fairest hawk 
them all will stoop to are you feeble weak
subject to the oppression the powerful here
is that will arm in your defence those more
mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear
are you splendid in your ashes and desire the
outward show opulence this dark chest
contains many a wide range hill and dale
many a fair forest full game the allegiance
 a thousand vassals wish you for favour in
courts temporal or spiritual the smiles 
kings the pardon popes and priests for old
crimes and the indulgence which encourages
priestridden fools to venture on new ones 
all these holy incentives to vice may be purchased
for gold revenge itself which the
gods are said to reserve to themselves doubtless
because they envy humanity so sweet a
morsel revenge itself is to be bought by it
but it is also to be won by superior skill and
that is the nobler mode reaching it i will
spare then my treasure for other uses and accomplish
my revenge gratis or rather i will add
the luxury augmented wealth to the triumph
 requited wrongs
thus thought dwining as returned from
his visit to sir john ramorny he added the
gold he had received for his various services to
the mass his treasure and having gloated
over the whole for a minute or two turned the
key on his concealed treasurehouse and walked
forth on his visits to his patients yielding
the wall to every man whom he met and bowing
and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher
that owned a petty booth nay to the artificers
who gained their precarious bread by the labour
 their walked hands
caitiffs was the thought his heart
while he did such obeisance base soddeii
witted mechanics did you know what this key
could disclose what foul weather from heaven
would prevent your unbonneting what putrid
kennel in your wretched hamlet would
be disgusting enough to make you scruple to
fall down and worship the owner such wealth
but i will make you feel my power though
it suits my humour to hide it i will be an incubus
to your city since you have rejected meas
a magistrate like the nightmare i will
hagride ye yet remain invisible myself this
miserable ramorny too he who in losing his
hand has like a poor artizan lost the only valuable
part his frame he heaps insulting language
on me as if anything which he can salad
powder to chafe a constant mind like mine yet
awhile hexjalls me rogue villain and slave he
acts as wisely as if he should amuse himself by
pulling hairs out my head while my hand
had hold this heartstrings every insult i
ran pay back instantly by a pang bodily
pain or mental agonysand he he i run
no long accounts with his knighthood that mast
be allowed
while the medicine was thus indulging his
diabolical musing and passing in his creeping
manner along the street the cry females was
heard behind him
ay there he is our lady be praised 
there is the most helpful man in perth said
one voice
they may speak knights and kings for
redressing wrongs as they call it but give me
worthy master dwining the potter carrier summers
replied another
at the same moment the leech was surrounded
and taken hold by the speakers good women
 the fair city 
how now what's the matter said dining
 whose cow has calved 
 there is no calving in the case said one 
the women but a poor fatherless wean dying 
so come wa wi you for our trust is constant
in you as bruce said to donald the isles
opiferque per orbem dicor said henbane
dwining what is the child dvin 
the croup the croup screamed one 
the gossips the innocent is rousing like a
corbie
cynanche trachealis that disease makes
brief work show me the house instantly
continued the medicine who was in the habit
 exercising his profession liberally notwithstanding
his natural avarice and humanely in
spite his natural malignity as we can suspect
him no better principle his motive was
probably vanity and the love his art
he would nevertheless have declined giving his
attendance in the present case had he known
whither the kind gossips were conducting him
in time sufficient to frame an apology but ere
he guessed whither he was going the leech was
hurried into the house the late oliver proudfate
from which he heard the chant the
women as they swathed and dressed the corpse
 the umquhile bonnetmaker for the ceremony
 next morning which chant the
following verses may be received as a modern
imitation

viewless essence thin and bare
well nigh melted into air 
still with fondness hovering near
the earthly form thou once didst wear 

pause upon thy pinion's flight
be thy course to left or right 
be thou doom'd to soar or sink
pause upon the awful brink

to avenge the deed expelling
thee untimely from thy dwelling
mystic force thou shalt retain
o'er the blood and o'er the brain

when the form thou shalt espy
that darken'd on thy closing eye 
when the footstep thou shalt hear
that thrill'd upon thy dying ear 

tien strange sympathies shall wake
the flesh shall thrill the nerves shall quake
the wounds renew their clotted flood
and every drop cry blood for blood 
hardened as he was the physician felt re 
luctancc to pass the threshold the man to j
whose death he had been so directly though
so far as the indmdual was concerned mistakingly
accessory
let me pass on women he said my
art can only help the living the dead are pastour
power
nay but your patient is up stain's the
youngest orphan 
dwining was compelled to go into the house
but he was surprised when the instant he
stepped over the threshold the gossips who
were busied with the dead body stinted suddenly
in their song while one said to the others 
in god's name who entered that was a
large gout blood 
not so said another voice it is a drop
 the liquid balm
nay summer it was blood again i say
who entered the house even now 
one looked out from the apartment into the
little entrance where dwining under pretence
 not distinctly seeing the trapladder by which
he was to ascend into the upper part this
house lamentation was delaying his progress
purposely disconcerted with what had reached
him the conversation
nay it is only worthy master henbane
dwining answered one the sibyls
only master dwining replied the one
who had first spoken in a tone acquiescence 
 our best helper in need then it must have
been balm sure enough
nay said the other it may have been
blood nevertheless for the leech look you
when the body was found was commanded by
the magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments
and how could the poor dead corpse
know that that was done with good purpose 
ay truly summer and as poor gossip
oliver often mistook friends for enemies while
he was in life his judgment cannot be thought
to have mended now
dwining heard no more being now forced
up stairs into a species garret where magdalen
sat on her widowed bed clasping to
her bosom her infant which already black in
the face and uttering the gasping crowing
sound which gives the popular name to the
complaint seemed on the point rendering up
its brief existence a dominican monk sat near
the bed holding the other child in his arms and
seeming from time to time to speak a word or
two spiritual consolation or intermingle
some observation on the child's disorder
the medicine cast upon the good father a
single glance filled with that ineffable disdain
which men science entertain against interlopers
his own aid was instant and efficacious 
he snatched the child from the despairing mother
stripped its throat and opened a vein
which as it bled freely relieved the little patient
instantaneously in a brief space every
dangerous symptom disappeared and dwining
having bound up the wound replaced the infant
in the arms the half distracted mother
the poor woman's distress for her husband's
loss which had been suspended during the extremity
 the child's danger now returned on
magdalen with the force an augmented torrent
which has borne down the dam dike that
for a while interrupted its waves
oh learned sir she said you see a poor
woman her that you once knew a richer 
but the hands that restored this bairn to my
arms must not leave this house empty generous
kind master dining accept his beads
they are made ebony and silver he aye
liked to have his things as handsome as any gentleman
 and liker he was in all his ways to a
gentleman than any one us and even so came
 it
with these words in a mute passion grief
she pressed to her breast and to her lips the
chaplet her deceased husband and proceeded
to thrust it into dwining's hands
take it she said for the love one
who loved you well ah he used ever to say
if ever man could be brought back from the
brink the grave it must be by master dining's
guidance and his ain bairn is brought
back this blessed day and he is lying there stark
and stiff and kens nothing its health and
sickness o woe is me and walk wa but
take the beads and think on his pair soul as
you put them through your fingers he will be
fineed from purgatory the sooner that good people
pray to assoilzie him
take back your beads summer i know
ho legerdemain can do no conjuring tricks
said the medicine who more moved than perhaps
his rugged nature had anticipated endeavoured
to avoid receiving the illomened gift
but his last words gave offence to the churchman
whose presence he had not recollected
when he uttered them
how now sir leech said the dominican 
do you call prayers for the dead juggling
tricks i know that chaucer the english
maker says you medicines that your study
is but little on the bible our mother the
church hath nodded late but her eyes are
now opened to discern friends from foes and
be well assured 
nay reverend father said d wining you
take me at too great advantage i said i could
do no miracles and was about to add that as
the church certainly could work such conclusions
those rich beads should be deposited in
your hands to be applied as they may best benefit
the soul the deceased
he dropped the beads into the dominican's
hand and escaped from the house mourn 
ing
this was a strangely timed visit he
said to himself when he got safe out doors
i hold such things cheap as any can yet
though it is but a silly fancy i am glad i saved
the squalling child's life but i must to my
friend smotherwell whom i have no doubt to
bring to my purpose in the matter bonthron 
and thus i shall save two lives and have destroyed
only one
chapter xi
the high church st john's in perth
being that the patron saint the burgh
had been selected by the magistrates as that in
which the community was likely to have most
fair play for the display the ordeal the
churches and convents the dominicans carthusian
and others the regular clergy had
been highly endowed by the king and nobles
and therefore it was the universal cry the
citycouncil that their ain goodauld st john
 whose good graces they thought themselves
sure ought to be fully confided in and preferred
to the new patrons for whom the dominicans
carthusian carmelite and others
had founded newer seats around the fair city
the disputes between the regular and secular
clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this
choice the spot in which heaven was to display
a species miracle upon a direct appeal
to the divine decision in a case doubtful guilt 
and the townclerk was as anxious that the
church st john should be preferred as if
there had been a faction in the body saints for
and against the interests that beautiful town
many therefore were the petty intrigues entered
into and disconcerted for the purpose 
fixing on the church but the magistrates considering
it as a matter touching in a close degree
the honour the city determined with judicious
confidence in the justice and impartiality
 their patron to confide the issue to the influence
 st john
it was therefore after high mass had been
performed with the greatest solemnity which
circumstances rendered the ceremony capable
and after the most repeated and fervent prayers
had been offered to heaven by the crowded assembly
that preparations were made for appealing
to the direct judgment heaven on the
mysterious murder the unfortunate bonnetmaker

the scene presented that effect imposing
solemnity which the rites the catholic church
are so well qualified to produce the eastern
window richly and variously painted streamed
down a torrent chequered light upon the
high altar on the bier placed before it were
stretched the mortal remains the murdered
man his arms folded on his breast and his
palms joined together with the fingers pointed
upwards as if the senseless clay was itself appealing
to heaven for vengeance against those
who had violently divorced the immortal spirit
from its mangled tenement
close to the bier was placed the throne which
supported robert scotland and this brother
albany the prince sat upon a lower stool
beside his father an arrangement which occasioned
some observation as albany's seat being
little distinguished from that the king the
heirapparent though full age seemed to be
degraded beneath his uncle in the sight the
assembled people perth the bier was so
placed as to leave the view the body it sustained
open to the greater part the multitude
assembled in the church
at the head the bier stood the knight kinfauns
the challenger and at the foot the young
earl crawford as representing the defendant
the evidence the duke rothsay in expurgation
as it was termed sir john ramorny
had exempted him from the necessity attendance
as a party subjected to the ordeal and
his illness served as a reason for his remaining
at home his household including those who
though immediately in waiting upon sir john
were accounted the prince's domestics and had
not yet received their dismissal amounted to
eight or ten persons most them esteemed men
 profligate habits and who might therefore
be deemed capable in the riot a festival
vol u

evening committing the slaughter the
bonnetmaker they were drawn up in a row
on the left side the church and wore a species
 white cassock resembling the dress a
penitentiary all eyes being bent on them several
 this band seemed so much disconcerted
as to excite among the spectators strong
prepossessions their guilt the real murderer
had a countenance incapable betraying him
a sullen dark look which neither the feast
nor winecup could enliven and which the peril
 discovery and death could not render dejected
we have already noticed the posture the
dead body the face was bare as were the breast
and arms the rest the corpse was shrouded
in a windingsheet the finest linen so that
if blood should flow from any place which was
covered it could not fail to be instantly manifest
high mass having been performed followed
by a solemn invocation to the deity that he
would be pleased to protect the innocent and
make known the guilty eviot sir john ramorn's
page was summoned to undergo the
ordeal he advanced with an illassured step
perhaps ho thought his internal consciousness
tho
that bonthron must have been the assassin
might be sufficient to implicate him in the murder
though he was not directly accessary to it
he paused before the bier and his voice faltered
as he swore by all that was created in
seven days and seven nights by heaven by
hell by his part paradise and by the god
and author all that he was free and sackless
 the bloody deed done upon the corpse
before which he stood and on whose breast he
made the sign the cross in evidence the appeal
no consequences ensued the body remained
stiff as before the curdled wounds gave
no sign blood
the citizens looked on each other with faces
 blank disappointment they had persuaded
themselves eviot's guilt and their suspicions
had been confirmed by his irresolute manner
their surprise at his escape was therefore
extreme the other followers ramorny took
heart and advanced to take the oath with a
boldness which increased as one by one they
performed the ordeal and were declared by the
voice the judges free and innocent every
suspicion attaching to them on account the
death oliver proudfute
but there was one individual who did not
partake that increasing confidence the name
 bonthron bonthron sounded three times
through the aisles the church but he who
owned it acknowledged the call no otherwise
than by a sort shuffling motion with his feet
as if he had been suddenly affected with a fit 
the palsy
speak dog whispered eviot or prepare
for a dog's death 
but the murderer's brain was so much disturbed
by the sight before him that the judges
beholding his deportment doubted whether to
ordain him to be dragged before the bier or to
pronounce judgment in default and it was not
until he was asked for the last time whether
he would submit to the ordeal that he answered
with his usual brevity 
i will not what do i know what juggling
tricks may be practised to take a poor man's
life i offer the combat to any man who says i
harmed that dead body
and according to usual form he threw his
glove upon the floor the church
henry smith stepped forward amidst the murmured
applause his fellowcitizens which
even the august presence could not entirely suppress
 and lifting the ruffian's glove which he
placed in his bonnet laid down his own in the
usual form as a gage battle but bonthron
raised it not
he is no match for me growled the savage
 nor fit to lift my glove i follow the
prince scotland in attending on his master
 horse this fellow is a wretched mechanic
here the prince interrupted him thou follow
me caitiff i discharge thee from my service
on the spot take him in hand smith and
beat himas thou didst never thump anvil the
villain is both guilty and recreant it sickens
me even to look at him and if my royal father
will be ruled by me he will give the parties
two handsome scottish axes and we will see

which them turns out the best fellow before
the day is half an hour older
this was readily assented to by the earl 
crawford and sir patrick charteris the godfathers
 the parties who as the combatants
were men inferior rank agreed that they
should fight in steel caps buff jackets and with
axes and that as soon as they could be prepared
for the combat
the lists were appointed in the skinners
yards a neighbouring space ground occupied
by the corporation from which it had the
name and who quickly cleared a space about
thirty feet by twentyfive for the combatants
thither thronged the nobles priests and commons
 all excepting the old king who detesting
such scenes blood retired to his residence and
devolved the charge the field upon the earl
 errol lord high constable to whose office
it more particularly belonged the duke albany
watched the whole proceeding vith a close
and wary eye his nephew gave the scene the
heedless degree notice which corresponded
vith his character
rill
when the combatants appeared in the lists
nothing could be more striking than the contrast
betwixt the manly cheerful countenance
 the smith whose sparkling bright eye seemed
already beaming with the victory he hoped
for and the sullen downcast aspect the brutal
bonthron who looked as if he were some
obscene bird driven into sunshine out the
shelter its darksome haunts they made
hath severally each to the truth his quarrel 
a ceremony which henry gow performed with
serene and manly confidence bonthron with a
dogged resolution which induced the duke 
rothsay to say to the high constable didst
thou ever my dear errol behold such a mixture
 malignity cruelty and i think fear as in that
fellow's countenance 
 he is not comely said the earl but n
powerful knave as i have seen
i'll gage a hogshead wine with you my
good lord that he loses the day henry the
armourer is as strong as he and much more
active and then look at his bold bearing 
there is something in that other fellow that ih
loathsome to look upon let them yoke presently
my dear constable for i am sick beholding
him
the highconstable then addressed the widow
who in her deep weeds and having her
children still beside her occupied a chair within
the lists woman do you willingly accept
 this man henry the smith to do battle
as your champion in this cause 
i do i do most willingly answered magdalen
proudfute and may the blessing god
and st john give him strength and fortune
since he strikes for the orphan and fatherless 
then i pronounce this a fenced field battle
said the constable aloud let no one
dare upon peril his life to interrupt this
combat by word speech or look sound trumpets
and fight combatants 
the trumpets flourished and the combatants
advancing from the opposite the lists
with a steady and even pace looked at each
other attentively well skilled in judging from
the motion the eye the direction in which
a blow was meditated they halted opposite
to and within reach each other and in turn
made more than one feint to strike in order to
ascertain the activity and vigilance the opponent
at length whether weary these manoeuvres
or fearing lest in a contest so conducted
his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the
activity the smith bonthron heaved up his
axe for a downright blow adding the whole
strength his sturdy arms to the weight the
weapon in its descent the smith however
avoided the stroke by stepping aside for it was
too forcible to be controlled by any guard which
he could have interposed ere bonthron recovered
guard henry struck him a sideling blow
on the steel headpiece which prostrated him
on the ground
 confess or die said the victor placing his
foot on the body the vanquished and holding
to his throat the point the axe which terminated
in a spike or poniard
i will confess said the villain glaring
wildly upward on the sky let me rise
 not till you have yielded said harry
smith
i do yield again murmured southron
and henry proclaimed aloud that his antagonist
was defeated
the dukes rothsay and albany the high
constable and the dominican prior now entered
the lists and addressing bonthron demanded
if he acknowledged himself vanquished
i do answered the miscreant
 and guilty the murder oliver proudfate

i am but i mistook him for another
 and whom didst thou intend to slay 
said the prior confess my son and merit
thy pardon in another world for with this thou
hast little more to do
i took the slain man answered the discomfited
combatant for him whose hand has
struck me down whose foot now presses me
 blessed be the saints said the prior 
 now all those who doubt the virtue the
holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their
error lo he is trapped in the snare which he
laid for the guiltless
s
 i scarce ever saw the man before said
the smith i never did wrong to him or his
ask him an it please your reverence why
he should have thought slaying me treacherously

it is a fitting question answered the
prior give glory where it is due my son
even though it is manifested by thy shame for
what reason would'st thou have waylaid this
armourer who says he never wronged thee 
 he had wronged him whom i served answered
bonthron and i meditated the deed
by his command
by whose command asked the prior
bonthron was silent for an instant then
growled out he is too mighty for me to
name
 hearken my son said the churchman 
tarry but a brief hour and the mighty and the
mean this earth shall to thee alike be empty
sounds the sledge is even now preparing to
drag thee to the place execution therefore
son once more i charge thee to consult thy
soups weal by glorifying heaven and speaking
the truth was it thy master sir john 
that stirred thee to so foul a deed 
no answered the prostrate villain it
was a gieater than he and at the same time
he pointed with his finger to the prince
wretch said the astonished duke 
rothsay do you dare to hint that was your
instigator 
you yourself my lord answered the unblushing
ruffian
 die in thy falsehood accursed slave 
said the prince and drawing his sword he
would have pierced his calumniator had not
the lord high constable interposed with word
and action
your grace must forgive my discharging
mine office this caitiff must be delivered into
the hands the executioner he is unfit to
be dealt with by any other much less by your
highness
what noble earl said albany aloud and
with much real or affected emotion would
you let the dog pass alive from hence to poison
the people's ears with false accusations
against the prince scotland i say cut him
to hammocks upon the spot 
your highness will pardon me said the
earl errol i must protect him till his
doom is executed
then let him he gagged instantly said
albany and you my royal nephew why
stand you there fixed in astonishment call
your resolution up speak to the prisoner 
swear protest by all that is sacred that you
knew not this felon deed see how the people
look on each other and whisper apart my
life on't that this lie spreads faster than any
gospel truth speak to them royal kinsman
no matter what you say so you be constant in
denial
what sir said rothsay starting from his
pause surprise and mortification and turning
haughtily towards his uncle would you
have me gage my royal word against that an
abject recreant let those who can believe the
son their sovereign the descendant bruce
capable laying ambush for the life a poor
mechanic enjoy the pleasure thinking the
villains tale true
that will not i for one said the smith
bluntly i never did aught but what was in
honour toward his royal grace the duke 
roth say and never received unkindness from
him in word look or deed and i cannot think
he would have given aim to such base practice
was it in honour that you threw his highness
from the ladder in curfew street upon
fastens even said bonthron or think you
the favour was received kindly or unkindly
this was so boldly said and seemed so plausible
that it shook the smith's opinion the
prince's innocence
alas my lord said he looking sorrowfully
towards rothsay could your highness
seek an innocent fellow's life for doing his duty
by a helpless maiden i would rather have
died in these lists than live to hear it said the
bruce's heir 
thou art a good fellow smith said the
prince but i cannot expect thee to judge
more wisely than others away with that convict
to the gallows and gibbet him alive an you
will that he may speak falsehood and spread
scandal on us to the last prolonged moment 
his existence 
so sang the prince turned away from the
lists disdaining to notice the gloomy looks
cast towards him as the crowd made slow and
reluctant way for him to pass and expressing
neither suiprise nor displeasure at a deep hollow
murmur or groan which accompanied
his retreat only a few his own immediate
followers attended him from the field
though various persons distinction had come
there in his train even the lower class 
citizens ceased to follow the unhappy prince
whose former indifferent reputation had exposed
him to so many charges impropriety and
levity and around whom there seemed now
darkening suspicions the most atrocious nature

he took his slow and thoughtful way to the
church the dominicans but the ill news
which fly proverbially fast had reached his father's
place retirement before he himself appeared
on entering the palace and inquiring for
the king the duke rothsay was surprised to
be informed that he was in deep consultation
with the duke albany who mounting on
horseback as the prince left the lists had reached
the convent before him he was about to
use the privilege his rank and birth to enter
the royal apartment when maclewis the commander
 the guard brandanes gave him to
understand in the most respectful terms that
he had special instructions which forbade his
admittance
go at least maclewis and let them know
that i wait their pleasure said the prince
if my uncle desires to have the credit shutting
the father's apartment against the son it
will gratify him to know that i am attending
in the outer hall like a lackey
may it please you said maclewis with
hesitation if your highness would consent
to retire just now and to wait a while in patience
i will send to acquaint you when the
duke albany goes and i doubt not that his
majesty will then admit your grace to his prc
sn
sence at present your highness must forgive
me it is impossible you can have access
i understand you maclewis but go nevertheless
and obey my commands
the officer rent accordingly and returned
with a message that the king was indisposed
and on the point retiring to his private chamber
 but that the duke albany would presently
wait upon the prince scotland
it was however a full half hour ere the
duke albany appeared a period time
which rothsay spent partly in moody silence
and partly in idle talk with maclewis and the
brandanes as the levity or irritability his
temper obtained the ascendant
at length the duke came and with him the
lord high constable whose countenance expressed
much sorrow and embarrassment
fair kinsman said the duke albany
i grieve to say that it is my royal brother's
opinion that it will be best for the honour 
the royal family that your royal highness do
restrict yourself for a time to the seclusion 
the high constable's lodgings and accept 
vol x
the noble earl here present for your principal
if not sole companion until the scandals which
have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted
or forgotten
 how is this my lord errol said the
prince in astonishment is your house to be
my jail and is your lordship to be my jailor

 the saints forbid my lord said the earl
 errol but it is my unhappy duty to obey
the commands your father by considering
your royal highness for some time as being
under my ward
 the prince the heir scotland under the
ward the high constable what reason can
be given for this is the blighting speech a
convicted recreant strength sufficient to tarnish
my royal escutcheon 
while such accusations are not refuted and
denied my kinsman said the duke albany
they will contaminate that a monarch
denied my lord exclaimed the prince 
by whom are they asserted save by a wretch
too infamous even by his own confession to be
credited for a moment though a beggar's character
not a prince's were impeached fetch
him hither let the rack be shown to him you
will soon hear him retract the calumny which
he dared to assert
the gibbet has done its work too surely to
leave bonthron sensible to the rack said the
duke albany he has been executed an
hour since
and why such haste my lord said the
prince know you it looks as if there were
practice in it to bring a stain on my name 
 the custom is universal the defeated combatant
in the ordeal battle is instantly transferred
from the lists to the gallows and yet
fair kinsman continued the duke albany
if you had boldly and strongly denied the imputation
i would have judged right to keep the
wretch alive for further investigation but as
your highness was silent i deemed it best to
stifle the scandal in the breath him that uttered
it
saint mary my lord but this is too insulting
 do yon my uncle and kinsman suppose
me guilty prompting such an useless and
unworthy action as that which the slave confessed

it is not for me to bandy questions with your
highness otherwise i would ask whether you
also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy
though less bloody attack upon the house in
couvrefew street be not angry with me
kinsman but indeed your sequestering yourself
for some brief space from the court were
it only during the king's residence in this city
where so much offence has been given is imperiously
demanded
rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation
 and looking at the duke in a very marked
manner replied 
uncle you are a good huntsman you
have pitched your toils with much skill but you
would have been foiled notwithstanding had
not the stag rushed among the nets free will
god speed you and may you have the profit
by this matter which your measures deserve
say to my father i obey his arrest my lord
high constable wait only your pleasure to
attend you to your lodgings since i am to lie
in ward i could not have desired a kinder or
more courteous warden
the interview between the uncle and nephew
being thus concluded the prince retired
with the earl errol to his lodgings the
citizens whom they met in the streets passing
to the further side when they observed the
duke rothsay to escape the necessity saluting
one whom they had been taught to consider
as a ferocious as well as unprincipled libertine
the constable's lodgings received the
owner and his princely guest both glad to leave
the streets yet neither feeling easy in the situation
which they occupied with regard to each
other within doors
we must return to the lists after the combat
had ceased and when the nobles had withdrawn
the crowds were now separated into
two distinct bodies that which made the smallest
in number was at the same time the most
distinguished for respectability consisting 
the better class inhabitants perth who
were gi'atulating the successful champion and
each other upon the triumphant conclusion
to which they had brought their feud with the
courtiers the magistrates were so much elated
on the occasion that they entreated sir patrick
characterises acceptance a collation in the
townhall to this henry the hero the day
was course invited or he was rather commanded
to attend he listened to the summons
with great embarrassment for it may be readily
believed his heart was with catharine glover
but the advice simon glover decided him
that veteran citizen had a natural and becoming
deference for the magistracy the fair city
and a high estimation all honours which
flowed from such a source
thou must not think to absent thyself from
such a solemn occasion son henry was his
advice sir patrick charteris is to be there
himself and i think it will be a rare occasion
for thee to gain his goodwill it is like he
may order thee a new suit harness and i
myself heard worthy bailie craigdallie say
there was a talk furbishing up the city's armory
 thou must not neglect the good trade
now that thou takes on thee an expensive family

tush father glover answered the embarrassed
victor i lack no custom and thou
knowest there is catharine who may wonder at
my absence and have her ear abused once more
by tales gleemaidens and i wot not what
fear not for that said the glover but
go like an obedient burgess where thy betters
desire to have thee i do not deny that it will cost
some trouble to make thy peace with catharine
about this duel for she thinks herself wiser in
such matters than king and council kirk and
canons provost and bailies but i will take
up the quarrel with her myself and will so
work for thee that though she may receive
thee tomorrow with somewhat a chiding
it shall melt into tears and smiles like an april
morning that begins with a mild shower
away with thee then my son and be constant
tomorrow after morning mass
the smith though reluctantly was obliged
to defer to the reasoning his proposed fatherinlaw
 and once determined to accept the 

your destined for him by the fathers the city
he extricated himself from the crowd and hastened
home to put on his best apparel in which
he presently afterwards repaired to the councillors
where the ponderous oak table seemed
to bend under the massy dishes choice
tay salmon and delicious sea fish from dundee
being the dainties which the fasting season
permitted whilst neither wine ale nor
metheglin were wanting to wash them down
the waits or minstrels the burgh played
during the repast and in the intervals the
music one them recited with great emphasis
a ions poetical account the battle 
fought by sir william wallace and
his redoubled captain and friend thomas 
montreville against the english general seward
 a theme perfectly familiar to all the
guests who nevertheless more tolerant that
their descendants listened as if it had all the
zest novelty it was complimentary to the
ancestor the knight kinfauns doubtless
and to other derbyshire families in passages
which the audience applauded vociferously
whilst they pledged each other in mighty
draughts to the memory the heroes who had
fought hy the side the champion scotland
the health henry wynd was quaffed with
repeated shouts and the provost announced
publicly that the magistrates were consulting
how they might best invest him with some distinguished
privilege or honorary reward to
show how highly his fellowcitizens valued his
courageous exertions
nay take it not thus an it like your worships
said the smith vixh his usual blunt
manner lest men say that valour must be rare
in perth when they reward a man for fighting
for the right a forlorn widow i am sure
there are many scores stout burghers in
perth would have done this day's argue as
well or better than i for in good sooth i
ought to have cracked yonder headpiece like
an earthen pipkin ay and would have done it
too if it had not been one which i myself tempered
for sir john ramorny but an the fair
city think rav service any worth i will
conceive it i'ar more than acquitted by any
aid which you may afford from the common
good to the support the widow magdalen
and her poor orphans
that may well be done said sir patrick
charteris and yet leave the fair city rich
enough to pay her debts to henry wynd 
which every man us is a better judge than
himself who is blinded with an unavailing nicety
which men call modesty and if the burgh
be too poor for this the provost will bear his
share the rover's golden angels have not all
taken flight yet
the beakers were now circulated under the
name a cup comfort to the widow and
anon flowed around once more to the happy
memory the murdered oliver now so bravely
avenged in short it was a feast so jovial
that all agreed nothing was wanting to render
it perfect but the presence the bonnetmate
public proper the burgh
ker himself whose calamity had occasioned the
meeting and who had usually furnished the
standing jest at such festive assemblies had
his attendance been possible it was drily observed
by bailie craigdallie he would certainly
have claimed the success the day and vouched
himself the avenger his own murder
at the sound the vesper bell the company
broke up some the graver sort going to evening
prayers where with halfshut eyes and shining
countenances they made a most orthodox
and edifying portion a lenten congregation 
others to their own homes to tell over the occurrences
 the fight and feast for the information
 the family circle and some doubtless
to the licensed freedoms some tavern the
door which lent did not keep so close shut
as the forms the church required henry
returned to the wynd warm with the good wine
and the applause his fellowcitizens and fell
asleep to dream perfect happiness and catharine
glover
we have said that when the combat was decided
the spectators were divided into two bodies
 these when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession
much the greater number or what might be
termed the rabble waited upon the subdued
and sentenced bonthron who was travelling ina
different direction and for a very opposite
purpose whatever may be thought the comparative
attractions the house mourning
and feasting under other circumstances there
can be little doubt which will draw most visitors
when the question is whether we would
witness miseries which we are not to share or
festivities which we are not to partake accordingly
the tumbril in which the criminal
was conveyed to execution was attended by far
the greater proportion the inhabitants 
perth
a friar was seated in the same car with the
murderer to whom he did not hesitate to communicate
under the seal confession the
same false asseveration which he had made upon
the place combat which charged the duke
 rothsay with being director the ambuscade
by which the unfortunate bonnetmaker
bad suffered the same falsehood he disseminated
among the crowd averring with unblushing
effrontery to those who were nighest
to the car that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the duke rothsay's
pleasure for a time he repeated these words
sullenly and doggedly in the manner one
reciting a task or a liar who endeavours by reiteration
to obtain a credit for his words which
he is internally sensible they do not deserve
but when he lifted up his eyes and beheld in
the distance the black outline a gallows at
least forty feet high with its ladder and its
fatal cord rising against the horizon he became
suddenly silent and the friar could observe that
he trembled very much
be comforted my son said the good
priest you have confessed the truth and received
absolution your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity and though
you have been a man bloody hands and cruel
heart yet by the church's prayers you shall
be in due time assailed from the penal fires
 purgatory
these assurances were calculated rather to
augment than to diminish the terrors the culprit
who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death
would to a certainty be effectual and some suspicion
whether there was really any purpose 
employing them in his favour for he knew his
master well enough to be aware the indifference
with which he would sacrifice one who
might on some future occasion be a dangerous
evidence against him
his doom however was sealed and there
was no escaping from it they slowly approached
the fatal tree which was erected on a
bank by the river's side about half a mile from
the walls the city a site chosen that the body
 the wretch which was to remain food for the
carrion crows might be seen from a distance in
every direction here the priest delivered bonthrone
to the executioner by whom he was assisted
up the ladder and to all appearance dispatched
according to the usual forms the law he
seemed to struggle for life for a minute but soon
fi
after hung still and inanimate the executioner
after remaining upon duty for more than
half an hour as if to permit the last spark 
life to be extinguished announced to the admirers
 such spectacles that the irons for the
permanent suspension the carcass not having
been got ready the concluding ceremony disembowelling
the dead body and attaching it
finally to the gibbet would be deferred till the
next morning at sunrise
notwithstanding the early hour which he had
named master smotherwell had a reasonable
attendance rabble at the place execution
to see the final proceedings justice with its
victim but great was the astonishment and
resentment these amateurs to find that the
dead body had been removed from the gibbet
they were not however long at a loss to guess
the cause its disappearance bonthron had
been the follower a baron whose estates lay in
fife and was himself a native that province
what was more natural than that some the
fife men whose boats were frequently plying
s
on the river should have clandestinely removed
the body their countryman from the place 
public shame the crowd vented their rage
against smotherwell for not completing his job
on the preceding evening and had not he and
his assistant betaken themselves to a boat and
escaped across the tay they would have run
some risk being pelted to death the event
however was too much in the spirit the times
to be much wondered at its real cause we shall

the incidents a narrative this kind
must be adapted to each other as the wards 
a key must tally accurately with those the
lock to which it belongs the reader however
gentle will not hold himself obliged to rest satisfied
with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place which is generally
speaking all that in ordinary life he can know
 what is passing around him but lie is desirous
while reading for amusement knowing
the interior movements occasioning the course
 events this is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity for every man hath a right to open
and examine the mechanism his own watch
put together for his proper use although he is
not permitted to pry into the interior the timepiece
which for general information is displayed
on the townsteeple
it would be therefore uncourteous to leave
my readers under any doubt concerning the
agency which removed the assassin southron
from the gallows an event which some the
perth citizens ascribed to the foul fiend himself
while others were content to lay it upon
the natural dislike bonthron's countrymen
 fife to see him hanging on the river side
as a spectacle dishonourable to their province
about midnight after the day when the execution
had taken place when the inhabitants
 perth were deeply buried in slumber three
men mused in their cloaks and bearing a
dark lantern descended the alleys a garden
wtdcb led from the house occupied by sir john
ramorny to the banks the tay where a small
boat lay moored to a landingplace or little
projecting pier the wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs
and bushes and a pale moon leaded as it is
termed in scotland amongst drifted clouds
which seemed to threaten rain the three individuals
entered the boat with great precaution
to escape observation one them was
a tall powerful man another short and bent
downwards the third middlesized and apparently
younger than his companions and light
and active thus much the imperfect light
could discover they seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier
we must let her drift with the current till
we pass the bridge where the burghers still
keep guard and you know the proverb a
perth arrow hath a perfect flight said the
most youthful the party who assumed the
office helmsman and pushed the boat off
from the pier whilst the others took the oars
which were muffled and rowed with all precaution
till they attained the middle the
river they then ceased their efforts lay upon
their oars and trusted to the steersman for keeping
her in midchannel
in this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded
beneath the stately gothic arches 
the old bridge erected by the magnificent patronage
 robert bruce in and carried
away by an inundation in although they
heard the voices a civic watch which since
these disturbances commenced had been nightly
maintained in that important pass no challenge
was given and when they were so far
down the stream as to be out hearing 
those guardians the night they began to
row but still with precaution and to converse
though in a low tone
you have found a new trade comrade since
i left you said one the rowers to the
other i left you engaged in tending a sick
knight and i find you employed in purloining a
dead body from the gallows
 a living body so please your squirehood
master buncle or else my craft hath failed 
its purpose
so i am told master pottercarrier but
saving your clerkship unless you tell me your
trick i will take leave to doubt its success
a simple toy master buncle not likely to
please a genius so acute as that your variance
marry thus it is this suspension 
the human body which the vulgar call hanging
operates death by apoplexy that is the blood
being unable to return to the heart by the compression
 the veins it rushes to the brain
and the man dies also and as an additional
cause dissolution the lungs no longer receive
the needful supply the vital air owing
to the ligature the cord around the thorax 
and hence the patient perishes
i understand that well enough but how
is it to be prevented sir medicine said the
third person who was no other than ramorny's
page eliot
 marry then replied dwining hang me
the patient up in such fashion thai the carotid
arteries shall not be compressed and the
blood will not determine to the brain and apoplexy
will not take place and again if there
be no ligature around the thorax the lungs
will be supplied with air whether the man be
hanging in the middle heaven or standing on
the firm earth
 all this i conceive said eviot but how
these precautions can be reconciled with the
execution the sentence hanging is what
my dull brain cannot comprehend
ah good youth thy variance hath spoiled
a fair wit hadst thou studied with me
thou should'st have learned things more difficult
than these but here is my trick i get
me certain bandages made the same substance
with your young variance's horsegirths
having especial care that they are a kind
which will not shrink on being strained since
that would spoil my experiment one loop
 this substance is drawn under each foot and
returns up either side the leg to a cincture
with vvbich it is united these cincture are
connected by divers straps down the breast and
back in order to divide the weight and there
arc sundry other conveniences for easing the
patient but the chief is this the straps or
ligatures are attached to a broad steel collar
curving outwards and having a hook or two
for the better security the halter which the
friendly executioner passes around that part 
the machine instead applying it to the bare
throat the patient thus when thrown off
from the ladder the sufferer will find himself
suspended not by his neck if it please you but
by a steel circle which supports the loops in
which his feet are placed and on which his
weight really rests diminished a little by similar
supports under each arm thus neither
vein nor windpipe being compressed the man
will breathe as free and his blood saving from
fright and novelty situation will flow as
temperately as your variance's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field battle
 by my faith a quaint and rare device 
quoth bunch
is it not pursued the leech and well
worth being known to such mounting spirits as
your vacancies since there is no knowing to
what height sir john ramorny's pupils may
arrive and if these be such that it is necessary
to descend from them by a rope you may find
my mode management more convenient than
the common practice marry but you must be
provided with a highcollared doublet to conceal
the ring steel and above all such
a bonus socius as smother well to adjust the
noose
base poisonvender said eviot men 
our calling die on the field battle 
i will save the lesson however replied
buncle in case some pinching occasion
but what a night the hangdog bloody bonthrone
must have had it dancing a pavise in
mid air to the music his own shackles as the
night wind swings him that way and this 
it were an alms deed to leave him there
said eviot for his descent from the gibbet
will but encourage him to new murders he
knows but two elements drunkenness and
bloodshed
perhaps sir john ramorny might have
been your opinion said dwining but it
would first have been necessary to cut out the
rogue's tongue lest he had told strange tales
from his airy height and there are other
reasons that it concerns not your vacancies to
know in truth i myself have been generous
in serving him for the fellow is built as strong
as edinburgh castle and his anatomy would
have matched any that is in the chirurgical hall
 padua but tell me master buncle what
news bring you from the doughty douglas 
they may tell that know said buncle
i am the dull ass that bears the message and
kens nought its purport the safer for myself
perhaps i carried letters from the duke
 albany and from sir john ramorny to the
douglas and he looked black as a northern
tempest when he opened them i brought them
answers from the earl at which they smiled
like the sun when the harvest storm is closing
over lira go to your ephemerides leech and
conjure the meaning out that
me thinks i can do so without much cost
 wit said the chirurgeon hut yonder i
see in the pale moon our deadalive should
he have screamed out to any chance passenger
it were a curious interruption to a nightjourney
to be hailed from the top such a gallows
as that hark methinks i do hear his groans
amid the whistling the wind and the creaking
 the chains so fair and softly make
fast the boat with the grappling and get out
the casket with my matters we would be better
for a little fire but the light might bring observation
on us come on my men valour
march warily for we are bound for the gallows
foot follow with the lantern i trust the ladder
has been left
as they advanced to the gibbet they could
plainly hear groans though uttered in a low
tone d wining ventured to give a low cough
once or twice by way signal but receiving
no answer we had best make haste said he
to ills companions for our friend must be in
extremes as he gives no answer to the signal
which announces the arrival help come
let us to the gear i will go up the ladder
first and cut the rope do you two follow one
after another and take fast hold the body so
that he fall not when the halter is unloosed
keep sure gripe for which the bandages will afford
you convenience bethink you that though
he plays an owes part tonight he hath no wings
and to fall out a halter may be as dangerous
as to fall into one
while he spoke thus he ascended the ladder
and having ascertained that the menatarms
who followed him had the body in their hold
he cut the rope and then gave his aid to support
the almost lifeless form the criminal
by a skilful exertion strength and address
the body bonthron was placed safely on the
ground and the faint yet certain existence 
life having been ascertained it was thence transported
to the river side where shrouded by
the bank the party might be best concealed
from observation while the leech employed himself
in the necessary means recalling animation
with which he had taken care to provide
himself
for this purpose he first freed the recovered
person from his shackles which the executioner
had left unlocked on purpose and at the
same time disengaged the complicated envelopes
and bandages by which he had been suspended
it was some time ere dwining's efforts succeeded
 for in despite the skill with which his
machine had been constructed the straps designed
to support the body had stretched so
considerably as to occasion the sense suffocation
becoming extremely overpowering but
the address the surgeon triumphed over all
obstacles and after sneezing and stretching
himself with one or two brief convulsions bonthrone
gave decided proofs animation by
arresting the hand the operator as it was in
the act dropping strong waters on his breast
and throat and directing the bottle which contained
them to his lips he took almost perforce
a considerable gulp the contents
it is spiritual essence double distilled said
the astonished operator and would blister
the throat and burn the stomach any other
man but this extraordinary beast is so unlike
all other human creatures that i should
not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession his faculties
bonthron sat up stared around and indicated
some consciousness existence
wine wine were the first words which
he articulated
the leech gave him a draught medicated
wine mixed with water he rejected it under
the dishonourable epithet kennelwashings
and again uttered the words wine 
wine
nay take it to thee i the devil's name
said the leech since none but he can judge
 thy constitution
a draught long and deep enough to have
discomposed the intellects any other person
was found effectual in recalling those bonthrone
to a more perfect states though he betrayed
no recollection where he was or what
ig
iiaj befallen him and in this brief and sullen
manner asked why he was broglie to the riverside
at this time night
another frolic the wild prince for
drenching me as he did before nails and
blood but i would 
hold thy peace interrupted eviot and
be thankful i pray you if you have any thankfulness
in you that thy body is not crows meat
and thy soul in a place where water is too
scarce to duck thee
i begin to bethink me said the ruffian 
and raising the flask to his mouth which he saluted
with a long and hearty kiss he set the
empty bottle on the earth dropped his head on
his bosom and seemed to muse for the purpose
 arranging his confused recollections
 we can abide the issue his meditations
no longer said dwining he will be better
after he has slept up sir you have been
riding the air these some hours try if the water
be not an easier mode conveyance your
valours must lend me a hand i can no more
lift this mass than i could raise in my arms a
slaughtered bull
stand upright on thine own feet bonthrone
now we have placed thee upon them
said eviot
i cannot answered the patient every
drop blood tingles in my veins as if it had
pinpoints and my knees refuse to bear their
burden what can be the meaning all this 
this is some practice thine thou dog leech
ay ay so it is honest bonthron said
d wining a practice thou shalt thank me for
when thou comest to learn it in the meanwhile
stretch down in the stern that boat
and let me wrap this cloak about thee assisted
into the boat accordingly bonthron was
deposited there as conveniently as things admitted
 he answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt a
boar who has got some food particularly agreeable
to him
rand now buncle said the chirurgeon
 your valiant squireship knows your charge
vol hi b
ib
you are to carry this lively cargo by the river
to newburgli where you are to dispose him
as you wot meantime here are his shackles
and bandages the marks his confinement
and liberation bind them up together and
fling them into the deepest pool you pass over 
for found in your possession they might tell tales
against us all this low light breath wind
from the west will permit you to use a sail as
soon as the light comes in and you are tired
 rowing your other valiancy master page
eviot must be content to return to perth with
me afoot for here severs our fair company 
take with thee the lantern buncle for thou
wilt require it more than we and see thou send
me back my flasket
as the pedestrians returned to perth eviot
expressed his belief that bonthron's understanding
would never recover the shock which
terror had inflicted upon it and which appeared
to him to have disturbed all the faculties 
this mind and in particular his memory
it is not so an it please your pagehood
said the leech bonthrons intellect such as
it is hath a solid character it will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath
been put in motion and then will rest in its
proper point gravity our memory is all
our powers mind that which is peculiarly
liable to be suspended deep intoxication or
sound sleep alike destroy it and yet it returns
when the drunkard becomes sober or the sleeper
is awakened terror sometimes produces the
same effects i knew at paris a criminal condemned
to die by the halter who suffered the
sentence accordingly showing no particular
degree timidity upon the scaffold and behaving
and expressing himself as men in the
same condition are wont to do accident did
for him what a little ingenious practice hath
done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted he was cut down and given to his
friends before life was extinct and i had the
good fortune to recover him but though he
recovered in other particulars he remembered
but little his trial and sentence his confession
on the morning his execution he 
he he in his usual chuckling manner he
remembered him not a word neither leaving
the prison nor his passage to the grave
where he suffered nor the devout speeches
with which he he he edified he he he so
many good christians nor ascending the fatal
tree nor taking the fatal leap had my revenant
the slightest recollection but here we
reach the point where we must separate for it
were unfit should we meet any the watch
that we be found together and it were also
prudent that we enter the city by different
gates my profession forms an excuse for my
going and coming at all times your valiant
pagehood will make such explanation as may
seem sufficing
i shall make my will a sufficient excuse if i
am interrogated said the haughty young man
yet i will avoid interruption if possible the
moon is quite obscured and the road as black
as a wolds mouth
tut said the physician let not your
valour care for that we shall tread darker paths
ere it be long
without inquiring into the meaning these
evilboding sentences and indeed hardly listening
to them in the pride and recklessness his
nature the page ramorny parted from his
ingenious and dangerous companion and each
took his own way
i
chapter 
the come true love never did run smooth
the ominous anxiety our armourer had
not played bim false when the good glover
parted with his intended soninlaw after the
judicial combat had been decided he found what
he indeed had expected that his fair daughter
was in no favourable disposition to her lover but
although he perceived that catharine was cold
restrained collected had cast away the appearance
 mortal passion and listened with a reserve
implying contempt to the most splendid
description he could give her the combat in
the skinners yards he was determined not to
take the least notice her altered manner but
to speak her marriage with his son henry asa
thing which must course take place at
length when she began as on a former occasion
to intimate that her attachment to the armourer
did not exceed the bounds friendship that
she was resolved never to marry that the pretended
judicial combat was a mockery the
divine will and human laws the glover not
unnaturally grew angry
i cannot read thy thoughts wench nor
can i pretend to guess under what wicked delusion
it is that you kiss a declared lover suffer
him to kiss you run to his house when a report
is spread his death and fling yourself into
his arms when you find him alone all this
shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her
parents in a match sanctioned by her father 
but such tokens intimacy bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem and is
determined not to marry are untimely and unmaidenly
you have already been more bounteous
 your favours to henry smith than your
mother whom god assoilzie ever was to me
before i married her tell thee catharine
this trifling with the love an honest man is
what i neither can will nor ought to endure i
have given my consent to the match and i insist
it shall take place without delay and that
you receive henry wynd tomorrow as a man
whose bride you are to be with all dispatch
a power more potent than yours father
will say no replied catharine
i will risk it my power is a lawful one
that a father over a child and an erring
child answered her father god and man
allow my influence
then may heaven help us said catharine
 for if you are obstinate in your purpose
we are all lost
 we can expect no help from heaven said
the glover when we act with indiscretion
 am clerk enough myself to know that and
that your causeless resistance to my will is sinful
every priest will inform you ay and more
than that you have spoken degradingly the
blessed appeal to god in the combat ordeal
take heed for the holy church is awakened to
watch her sheepfold and to extirpate heresy by
fire and steel so much i warn thee 
catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation 
and with difficulty compelling herself to assume
an appearance composure promised her
father that if he would spare her any farther
discussion the subject till tomorrow morning
she would then meet him determined to
make a full discovery heirs sentiments
with this promise simon glover was obliged
to remain contented though extremely anxious
for the postponed explanation it could not be
levity or fickleness character which induced
his daughter to act with so much apparent inconsistency
towards the man his choice
and whom she had so lately unequivocally owned
to be also the man her own what external
force there could exist a kind powerful
enough to change the resolutions she had so
decidedly expressed within twentyfour hours
was a matter complete mystery
but i will be as obstinate as she can bethought
the glover and she shall either marry
henry smith without farther delay or old
simon glover will know an excellent reason to
the contrary
the subject was not renewed during the
evening but early on the next morning just
at surprising catharine knelt before the bed
in which her parent still slumbered her heart
sobbed as if it would burst and her tears fell
thick upon her father's face the good old man
awoke looked up crossed his child's forehead
and kissed her affectionately
i understand thee kate he said thou
art come to confession and i trust art deft

serous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere

catharine was silent for an instant
i need not ask my father if you remember
the carthusian monk clement and his
preaching and lessons at which indeed you
assisted so often that you cannot be ignorant
men called you one his converts and with
greater j justice termed me so likewise 
i am aware both said the old man
raising himself on his elbow but i defy foul
fame to show that i ever owned him in anv

heretical proposition though i loved to hear
him talk the corruptions the church the
misgovernment the nobles and the wild ignorance
 the poor proving as it seemed to me
that the sole virtue our commonweal its
strength and its estimation lay among the
burgher craft the better class which i received
as comfortable doctrine and creditable
to the town and if he preached other than
right doctrine wherefore did his superiors in
the carthusian convent permit it if the shepherds
turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the
flock they should not blame the sheep for being
worried
they endured his preaching nay they encouraged
it said catharine while the vices
 the laity the contentions the nobles and
the oppression the poor were the subject 
his censure and they rejoiced in the crowds
who attracted to the carthusian church forsook
those the other convents but the hypocrites
 for such they are joined with the
other fraternities in accusing their preacher clement
when passing from censuring the crimes
 the state he began to display the pride ignorance
and luxury the churchmen themselves 
their thirst power their usurpation overrun's
consciences and their desire to augment their
worldly wealth
for god's sake catharine said her father
 speak within doors your voice rises intone
and your speech in bitterness your eyes
sparkle it is owing to this zeal in what concerns
you no more than others that malicious
persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous
name a heretic
you know i speak no more than what is
truth said catharine and which you yourself
have avouched often
by needle and buckskin no answered
the glover hastily would'st thou have me
avouch what might cost me life and limb laud
and goods for a full commission hath been
granted for taking and trying heretics upon
whom is laid the cause all late tumults and
miscarriages wherefore few words are best
wench i am ever mind with the old maker

een perverted and yon
are in dittay as a gross railer against church and
churchmen and for holding discourse against
them with loose and profligate persons such as
the deceased oliver proudfute the smith
henry the wynd and others set forth as
commending the doctrines father clement
whom they charge with seven rank heresies and
seek for with staff and spear to try him to the
death but that said catharine kneeling and
looking upwards with the aspect one those
beauteous saints whom the catholics have given
to the fine arts that they shall never do
he hath escaped from the net the fowler 
and i thank heaven it was by my means
thy means girl art thou mad said the
amazed glover
i will not deny what i glory in answered
catharine it was by my means that concha
was led to come hither with a party men and
carry off the old man who is now far beyond
the highland line
o my rash my unlucky child said the
glover hast thou dared to aid the escape 
one accused heresy and to invite highlanders
in arms to interfere with the administration
 justice within burgh alas thou hast offended
both against the laws the church and
those the realm what what would become
 us were this known 
it is known my dear father said the maiden
firmly known even to those who will
be the most willing avengers the deed
this must be some idle notion catharine
or some trick those cogging priests and nuns 
it accords not with thy late cheerful willingness
to wed henry smith
alas dearest father remember the dismal
surprise occasioned by his reported death and
the joyful amazement at finding him alive and
deem it not wonder if i permitted myself under
your protection to say more than my reflection
justified but then i knew not the worst
and thought the danger exaggerated alas i
was yesterday fearfully undeceived when the
abbess herself came hither and with her the
dominican they showed me the commission
under the broad seal scotland for inquiring
into and punishing heresy they showed me
ig
your name and my own in a list suspected
persons and it was with tears real tears that
the abbess conjured me to avert a dreadful
fate by a speedy retreat into the cloister and
that the monk pledged his word that you should
not be molested if i complied
the foul fiend take them both for crocodiles
 said the glover
alas replied catharine complaint oranger
will little help us but you see i have had
real cause for this present alarm
alarm call it utter ruin alas my reckless
child where was your prudence when you
ran headlong into such a snare 
hear me father said catharine there
is still one mode safety held out it is one
which i have often proposed and for which i
have in vain supplicated your permission
i understand you the convent said her
father but catharine what abbess or prioress
would dare 
that i will explain to you father and it
will also show the circumstances which have
made me seem unsteady resolution to a demo

gree which has brought censure upon me from
yourself and others our confessor old father
francis whom i chose from the dominican convent
at your command 
ay truly interrupted the glover and i
so counselled and commanded thee in order to
take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction father clement
well this father francis has at different
times urged and provoked me to converse on
such matters as he judged i was likely to learn
something from the carthusian preacher
heaven forgive me my blindness i fell into the
snare spoke freely and as he argued gently as
one who would fain be convinced i even argued
warmly in defence what i believed devoutly
the confessor assumed not his real aspect and
betrayed not his secret purpose until he had
learned all that i had to tell him it was then
that he threatened me with temporal punishment
and with eternal condemnation had his
threats reached mc alone i could have stood
firm for their cruelty on earth i could have
vol iii c
s
endured and their power beyond this life i have
no belief in
for heaven's sake said the glover vrbo
was wellnigh beside himself at perceiving at
every new word the increasing extremity his
daughter's danger beware blaspheming the
holy church whose arms are as prompt to
strike as her ears are sharp to hear
to me said the maid perth again
looking up the terrors the threatened denunciations
would have been little avail 
but when they spoke involving thee my father
in the charge against me i own i trembled
and desired to compromise the abbess
martha elcho nunnery being my mother's
kinswoman i told her my distresses and
obtained her promise that she would receive me
if renouncing worldly love and thoughts wedlock
i would take the veil in her sisterhood
she had conversation on the topic i doubt not
with the dominican francis and both joined
in singing the same song remain in the
world said they and thy father and thou
shall be brought to trial as heretics assume the
veil and the errors both shall be forgiven and
cancelled they spoke not even recantation
 errors doctrine all should be peace if i
would but enter the convent
i doubt not i doubt not said simon 
the old glover is thought rich and his wealth
would follow his daughter to the convent 
elcho unless what the dominicans might claim
as their own share so this was thy call to the
veil these thy objections to henry wynd 
indeed father the course was urged on
all hands nor did my own mind recoil from it
sir john ramorny threatened me with the
powerful vengeance the young prince if i
continued to repel his wicked suit and as for
poor henry it is but late that i have discovered
to my own surprise that that i love
his virtues more than i dislike his faults alas 
the discovery has only been made to make my
quitting the world more difficult than when 
thought i had thee only to regret
she rested her head on her hand and wept
bitterly
 all this is folly said the glover never
was there an extremity so pinching but
what a wise man might find counsel if he was
daring enough to act upon it this has never
been the land or the people over whom priests
could rule in the name rome without their
usurpation being controlled if they are to punish
each honest burgher who says the monks
love gold and that the lives some them
cry shame upon the doctrines they teach why
truly stephen smothered will not lack employment
 and if all foolish maidens are to be
secluded from the world because they follow
the erring doctrines a popular preaching friar
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive
their inmates on slighter composition our
privileges have been often defended against the
pope himself by our good monarchs yore
and when he pretended to interfere with the
temporal government the kingdom there
wanted not a scottish parliament who told him
his duty in a letter that should have been written
in letters gold i have seen the epistle
myself and though i could not read it the very
sight the seals the right reverend prelates
and noble and true barons which hung at it
made my heart leap for joy thou should'st not
have kept this secret my child but it is no time
to tax thee with thy fault go down get me
some food i will mount instantly and go to our
lord provost and have his advice and as i
trust his protection and that other truehearted
scottish nobles who will not see a true
man trodden down for an idle word
 alas my father said catharine it was
even this impetuosity which i dreaded i knew
if i made my plaint to you there would soon be
fire and feud as if religion though sent to us by
the father peace were fit only to be the mother
 discord and hence i could now even
now give up the world and retire with my
sorrow among the sisters elcho would you
but let me be the sacrifice only father comfort
poor henry when we are parted for ever 
and do not do not let him think me too
harshly say catharine will never vex him
more by her remonstrances but that she will
never forget him in her prayers
 the girl bath a tongue that would make a
saracen weep said her father his own eyes
sympathizing with those his daughter but
i will not yield way to this combination between
the nun and the priest to rob me 
my only child away with you girl and let
me don my clothes and prepare yourself to
obey me in what i may have to recommend for
your safety get a few clothes together and
what valuables thou hast also take the keys
 my iron box which poor henry smith gave
me and divide what gold you find into two portions
 put the one into a purse for thyself and
the other into the quilted girdle which i made
on purpose to wear on journeys thus both shall
be provided in case fate should sunder us in
which event god send the whirlwind may take
the withered leaf and spare the green one let
them make ready my horse instantly and the
white jennet that i bought for thee but a day since
hoping to see thee ride to st john's kirk with
maids and matrons as blithe a bride as ever
crossed the holy threshold but it skills not talking
 away and remember that the saints help
those who are willing to help themselves not
word in answer begone i say no wilfulness
now the pilot in calm weather will let a
seaboy trifle with the rudder but by my soul
when winds howl and waves arise he stands
by the helm himself away no reply
catharine left the room to execute as well
as she might the commands her father who
gentle in disposition and devotedly attached
to his child suffered her often as it seemed to
guide and rule both herself and him yet who
as she knew was wont to claim filial obedience
and exercise parental authority with sufficient
strictness when the occasion seemed to require
an enforcement domestic discipline
while the fair catharine was engaged in
executing her father's behests and the good
old glover was hastily attiring himself as one
who was about to take a journey a horse's
tramp was heard in the narrow street the
horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak having
the cape it drawn up as if to hide the
under part his face while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows and a broad plume ohscared
bis upper features he sprung from the
saddle and dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom
ere the stranger had ascended the stair and entered
the sleeping apartment simon astonished
and alarmed and disposed to see in this
early visitant an apparitor or sumner come to
attach him and his daughter was much relieved
when as the stranger doffed the bonnet
and threw the skirt the mantle from his face
he recognised the knightly provost the fair
city a visit from whom at any time was a favour
 no ordinary degree but being made at
such an hour had something marvellous and
connected with the circumstances the times
even alarming
sir patrick charteris said the glover
 this high honour done to your poor beadsman
 
hush said the knight there is no time
for idle civilities i came hither because a
man is in trying occasions his own safest page
and i can remain no longer than to bid thee
fly good glover since warrants are to be
granted this day in council for the arrest thy
daughter and thee under charge heresy
and delay will cost you both your liberty for
certain and perhaps your lives
i have heard something such a matter
said the glover and was this instant setting
forth to kinfauns to plead my innocence 
this scandalous charge to ask your lordship's
counsel and to implore your protection
thy innocence friend simon will avail
thee but little before prejudiced judges my
advice is in one word to fly and wait for happier
times as for my protection we must tarry till
the tide turns ere it will in any sort avail thee
but if thou canst lie concealed for a few days
or weeks i have little doubt that the churchmen
who by siding with the duke albany
in court intrigue and by alleging the decay 
the purity catholic doctrine as the sole cause
 the present national misfortunes have at least
for the present hour an irresistible authority
over the king wil receive a check in the meanwhile
however know that king robert hath
not only given way to this general warrant for
inquisition after heresy but hath confirmed
the pope's nomination robert wardle to
be archbishop st andrews and primate 
scotland thus yielding to rome those freedoms
and immunities the scottish church which
his ancestors from the time malcolm canmore
have so boldly defended his brave fathers
would have rather subscribed a covenant
with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions rome
alas and what remedy 
none old man save in some sudden court
change said sir patrick the king is but like
a mirror which having no light itself reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed
near to it for the time now although the douglas
is banded with albany yet the earl is unfavourable
to the high claims those domineering
priests having quarrelled with them about the
exactions which his retinue hath raised on the
abbot arbroath he will come back again
with a high hand for report says the earl 
march hath fled before him when he returns
we shall have a changed world for his presence
will control albany especially as many nobles
and i myself as i tell you in confidence are
resolved to league with him to defend the general
right thy exile therefore will with his
return to our court thou hast but to seek thee
some temporary hiding place
for that my lord said the glover i
can be at no loss since i have just title to the
protection the high highland chief gilchrist
maclan chief the clan quhele
nay if thou canst take hold his mantle
thou needs no help any one else neither lowland
churchman nor layman finds a free course
 justice beyond the highland frontier
but then my child noble sir my catharine
 said the glover
let her go with thee man the grattan
cake will keep her white teeth in order the
goat's whey will make the blood spring to her
cheek again which these alarms have banished 
and even the fair maiden perth may sleep
soft enough on a bed highland grecian
it is not from such idle respects my lord
that i hesitate said the glover catharine
is the daughter a plain burgher and knows
not nicety food or lodging but the son 
maclan hath been for many years a guest in
my house and i am obliged to say that i have
observed him looking at my daughter who is
as good as a betrothed bride in a manner that
though i cared not for it in this lodging in curfew
street would give me some fear consequences
in a highland glen where i have no
friend and conachar many
the knightly provost replied by along whistle
 whew whew nay in that case i advise
thee to send her to the nunnery at elcho where
the abbess if i forget not is some relation 
yours indeed she said so herself adding that
she loved her kinswoman well together with all
that belongs to thee simon
truly my lord i do believe that the abbess
hath so much regard for me that she would
willingly receive the trust my daughter and
my whole goods and gear into her sisterhood 
marry her affection is something a tenacious
character and would be loath to unloose its
hold either upon the wench or her tocher

whew whew again whistled the knightly
provost by the thane's cross man
but this is an illfavoured pirn to wind yet
it shall never be said the fairest maid in the
fair city was cooped up in a convent like a
kainhen in a cave and she about to be married
to the bold burgess henry wynd that
tale shall not be told while i wear belt and
spurs and am called provost perth
but what remedy my lord asked the
glover
we must all take our share the risk
come get you and your daughter presently to
horse you shall ride with me and we'll see
who dare gloom at you the summons is not
yet served on thee and if they send an apparitor
to kinfauns without a warrant under the king's
own hand i make mine avow by the red rover's
soul that he shall eat his writ both
wax and wetherskin to horse to horse and
addressing catharine as she entered at the moment
 you too my pretty maid
to horse and fear not for your quarters 
they thrive in law that trust in charters
in a minute or two the father and daughter
were on horseback both keeping an arrow's
flight before the provost by his direction that
they might not seem to be the same company
they passed the eastern gate in some haste
and rode forward roundly until they were out
 sight sir patrick followed leisurely but
when he was lost to the view the warders
he sparred his mettled horse and soon came
up with the glover and catharine when a conversation
ensued which throws light upon some
previous passages this history
chapter iii
i have been devising a mode said the
wellmeaning provost by which i may make
you both secure for a week or two from the
malice your enemies when i have little doubt
i may see a changed world at court but that
i may the better judge what is to be done tell
me frankly simon the nature your connexion
with gilchrist maclan which leads you to
repose such implicit confidence in him you
are a close observer the rules the city and
are aware the severe penalties which they denounce
against such burghers as have covenant
alliance with the highland clans
true my lord but it is also known to
you that our craft working in skins cattle
stags and every other description hides have
a privilege and are allowed to transact with those
highlanders as with the men who can most
readily supply us with the means conducting
our trade to the great profit the burgh
thus it hath chanced me to have great dealings
with these men and i can take it on my
salvation that you nowhere find more just and
honourable trafficked or by whom a man may
more easily make an honest penny i have made
in my day several distant journeys into the far
highlands upon the faith their chiefs nor
did i ever meet with a people more true to their
word when you can once prevail upon them to
plight it in your behalf and as for the highland
chief gilchrist maclan saving that he is hasty
in homicide and fireraising towards those with
whom he hath deadly feud i have nowhere seen
a man who walketh a more just and upright
path
it is more than ever i heard before said
sir patrick charteris yet i have known
something the highland run agates too
they sliovv another favour and a very different
one to their friends than to their enemies
as your lordship shall understand said the
glover however be that as it may it chanced
me to serve gilchrist maclan in a high
matter it is now about eighteen years since
that it chanced the clan quhele and clan
chattan being at feud as indeed they are seldom
at peace the former sustained such a defeat
as wellnigh extirpated the family their
chief maclan seven his sons were slain in
battle and after it himself put to flight and his
castle taken and given to the flames his wife
then near the time giving birth to an infant
fled into the forest attended by one faithful servant
and his daughter here in sorrow and care
enough she gave birth to a boy and as the misery
 the mother's condition rendered her little
able to suckle the infant he was nursed with the
milk a doe which the forester who attended
her contrived to take alive in a snare it
was not many months afterwards that in a second
encounter these fierce clans maclan
defeated his enemies in his turn and regained
vol iii d
possession the district which he had lost it
was with unexpected rapture that he found his
wife and child were in existence having never
expected to see more them than the bleached
bones from which the wolves and wildcats had
eaten the flesh
but a strong and prevailing prejudice such
as is often entertained by these wild people
prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained
his only son in safety an ancient prophecy
was current among them that the power 
the tribe should fall by means a boy born under
a bush holly and suckled by a white doe
the circumstance unfortunately for the chief
tallied exactly with the birth the only child
which remained to him and it was demanded
 him by the elders the clan that the boy
should be either put to death or at least removed
from the dominions the tribe and brought
up in obscurity gilchrist mac ian was obliged to
consent and having made choice the latter
proposal the child under the name conachar
was brought up in my family with the purpose
as was at first intended concealing from him
all knowledge who or what he was or his
pretensions to authority over a numerous and
warlike people but as years rolled on the elders
 the tribe who had exerted so much authority
were removed by death ter rendered incapable
 interfering in the public affairs by age 
while on the other hand the influence gilchrist
maclan was increased by his successful
struggles against the clan chattan in which he
restored the equality betwixt the two contending
confederacies which had existed before the
calamitous defeat which i told your honour
feeling himself thus firmly seated he naturally
became desirous to bring home his only son
to his bosom and family and for that purpose
caused me to send the young conachar
as he was called more than once to the highlands
he was a youth expressly made by his
form and gallantry bearing to gain a father's
heart at length i suppose the lad either
guessed the secret his birth or something
 it was communicated to him and the disgust
which the haughty hieland varlet had always
shown for my honest trade became more 

fest so that i dared not so much as lay my
staff over bis costard for fear receiving a
stab with a dirk as an answer in gaelic to a
saxon remark it was then i wished to be well
rid him the rather that he showed so much
devotion to catharine who forsooth set herself
up to wash the ethiopian and teach a
wild husbandman mercy and morals she knows
herself how it ended
nay my father said catharine it was
surely but a point charity to snatch the brand
from the burning
but a small point wisdom said her father
 to risk the burning your own fingers
for such an what says my lord to the
matter 
my lord would not offend the fair maid 
perth said sir patrick and he knows well
the purity and truth her mind and yet i must
needs say that had this nursling the doe
been shrivelled haggard crossmade and repaired
like some highlanders i have known i
question if the fair maiden perth would
have bestowed so much zeal upon his converts

sioii and if catharine had been as aged wrinkled
and bent by years as the old woman that
opened the door to me this morning i would
wager my gold spurs against a pair highland
brogues that this wild roebuck would
never have listened to a second lecture you
laugh glover and catharine blushes a blush
 anger let it pass it is the way the
world
the way in which the men the world
esteem their neighbours my lord answered
catharine with some spirit
nay fair saint forgive a jest said the
knight and thou simon tell us how this
tale ended with conachar's escape to the
highlands i suppose 
 with his return thither said the glover
there was for some two or three years a fellow
about perth a sort messenger who came
and went under divers pretences but was in
fact the means communication between gilchrist
maclan and his son young conachar
or as he is now called hector from this gillie
i learned in general that the banishment
 the dault an neigh deil or foster child 
the white doe was again brought under consideration
 the tribe his foster father torquit
 the oak the old forester appeared with
eight sons the finest men the clan and demanded
that the doom banishment should be
revoked he spoke with the greater authority
as he was himself taishatar or a seer and
supposed to have communication with the invisible
world he affirmed that he had performed
a magical ceremony termed tinegan
by which he evoked a fiend from whom he extorted
a confession that conachar now called
eachin or hector maclan was the only man
in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without
blood or blemish hence torquil the oak
argued that the presence the fated person
was necessary to insure the victory so much
i am possessed this said the forester that
unless eachin fight in his place in the ranks 
the clan quhele neither i his fosterfather
nor any my eight sons will lift a weapon in
the quarrel
this speech was received with much alarm
for the defection nine men the stoutest their
tribe would be a serious blow more especially
if the combat as begins to be rumoured should be
decided by a small number from each side the
ancient superstition concerning the foster son 
the white doe was counterbalanced by a new
and later prejudice and the father took the opportunity
 presenting to the clan his longhidden
son whose youthful but handsome and
animated countenance haughty carriage and
active limbs excited the admiration the clansmen
who joyfully received him as the heir and
descendant their chief notwithstanding the
ominous presage attending his birth and nurture

from this tale my lord continued simon
glover your lordship may easily conceive
why i myself should be secure a good reception
among the clan quhele i and you may also
have reason to judge that it would be very rash
in me to carry catharine thither and this
noble lord is the heaviest my troubles
we shall lighten the load then said sir
patrick aod good glover i will take risk
for thee and this damsel my alliance with the
douglas gives me some interest with marjory
duchess rothsay his daughter the neglected
wife our wilful prince rely on it good
glover that in her retinue thy daughter will
be as secure as in a fenced castle the duchess
keeps house now at falkland a castle which
the duke albany to whom it belongs has
lent to her for her accommodation i cannot
promise you pleasure fair maiden for the
duchess marjory rothsay is unfortunate
and therefore splenetic haughty and overbearing
 conscious the want attractive qualities
therefore jealous those women who possess
them but she is firm in faith and noble
in spirit and would fling pope or prelate into
the ditch her castle who should come to arrest
any one under her protection you will
therefore have absolute safety though you may
lack comfort
i have no title to more said catharine and
deeply do i feel the kindness that is willing to
secure me such honourable protection if she
be haughty i will remember she is a douglas
and hath right to entertain as much pride as may
become a mortal if she be fretful i will recollect
that she is unfortunate and if she be unreasonably
captious i will not forget that she is
my protectress heed no longer for me my lord
when you have placed me under the noble lady's
charge but my poor father to be exposed
amongst these wild and dangerous people 
vhich was
regarded by the clan as a species palladium
only produced and used on the most solemn occasions
such as the present
the booshalloch somewhat discontented
muttered to simon as he took his place these
are changed days friend his father rest his
soul would have spoken to us both but these
are bad manners which he has learned among
you sassenachs in the low country
to this remark the glover did not think it
necessary to reply instead which he adverted
to the evergreens and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior 
the bower was decorated the most remarkable
part these ornaments was a number highland
shirts mail with steel bonnets battleaxes
and twohanded swords to match which
hung around the upper part the room together
with targets highly and richly embossed
each mail shirt was hung over a welldressed
stag's hide which at once displayed the armour
to advantage and saved it from suffering by
damp
these whispered the booshalloch are
the arms the chosen champions the clan
quhele they are twentynine in number as
you see eachin himself being the thirtieth who
wears his armour today else had there been
thirty and he has not got such a good hauberk
after all as he should wear on palm sunday
these nine suits harness such large
size are for the leichtach from whom so much
is expected
 and these goodly deerhides said simon
the spirit his profession awakening at the
sight the goods in which he traded think
you the chief will be disposed to chaffer for
them they are in demand for the doublets
which knights wear under their armour
did i not pray you said niel booshalloch
to say nothing on that subject
it is the mail shirts i speak said simon
 may i ask if any them were made
by our celebrated perth armourer called henry
 the wynd 
thou art more unlucky than before said
niel that man's name is to eachin's temper
like a whirlwind upon the lake yet no man
knows for what cause
i can guess thought our glover but gave
no utterance to the thought and having twice
lighted on unpleasant subjects conversation
he prepared to apply himself like those around
him to his food without starling another topic
we have said as much the preparations as
may lead the reader to conclude that the festival
in respect the quality the food was 
the most rude description consisting chiefly 
huge joints meat which were consumed with
little respect to the fasting season although
several the friars the island convent graced
and hallowed the board by their presence the
platters were wood and so were the hooped
rogues or cups out which the guests
quaffed their liquor as also the broth or juice
 the meat which was held a delicacy there
were also various preparations milk which
were highly esteemed and were eaten out 
similar vessels bread was the scarcest article
at the banquet but the glover and his patron
niel were served with two small loaves expressly
for their own use in eating as indeed was
then the case all over britain the guests used
their knives called scenes or the large poniards
named dirks without troubling themselves by
the reflection that they might occasionally have
served different or more fatal purposes
at the upper the table stood a vacant
seat elevated a step or two above the floor it
was covered with a canopy holly boughs and
ivy and there rested against it a sheathed sword
and a folded banner this had been the seat 
the deceased chieftain and was left vacant in
honour him eachin occupied a lower chair
on the right hand the place honour
the reader would be greatly mistaken who
should follow out this description by supposing
that the guests behaved like a herd hungry
wolves rushing upon a feast rarely offered to
them on the contrary the clan quhele conducted
themselves with that species courteous
reserve and attention to the wants others
which is often found in primitive nations especially
such as are always in arms because a
general observance the rules courtesy is
necessary to prevent quarrels bloodshed and
death the guests took the places assigned
them by torquil the oak who acting as
marischal taeh i e sewer the mess touched
with a white wand without speaking a
word the place where each was to sit thus
placed in order the company patiently waited
for the portion assigned them which was distributed
among them by the leichtach the bravest
men or more distinguished warriors the
tribe being accommodated with a double mess
emphatically called hieyfir or the portion 
a man when the sewers themselves had seen
every one served they resumed their places
at the festival and were each served with one
 these larger messes food water was placed
within each man's reach and a handful
 soft moss served the purposes a tablenapkin
so that as at an eastern banquet the hands
were washed as often as the mess was changed
for amusement the bard recited the praises
 the deceased chief and expressed the clan's
confidence in the blossoming virtues his
successor the seanachie recited the genealogy
 the tribe which they traced to the race
the dalriads the harpers played within while
the warpipes cheered the multitude without
the conversation among the guests was grave
subdued and civil no jest was attempted beyond
the bounds a very gentle pleasantry
calculated only to excite a passing smile there
were no raised voices no contentious arguments
and simon glover had heard a hundred times
more noise at a guildfeast than was made on
this occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers

even the liquor itself did not seem to raise
the festive party above the same tone decorous
gravity it was various kinds wine
appeared in very small quantities and was served
out only to the principal guests among
which honoured number simon glover was
again included the wine and the two wheaten
loaves were indeed the only marks notice
which he received during the feast but niel
booshalloch jealous his master's reputation
for hospitality failed not to enlarge on them as
proofs high distinction distilled liquors
since so generally used in the highlands were
then comparatively unknown the usquebaugh
ill
was circulated in small quantities and was
highly flavoured with a decoction saffron and
other hers so as to resemble a medicinal potion
rather than a festive cordial cider and
mead were seen at the entertainment but ale
brewed in great quantities for the purpose and
flowing round without restriction was the liquor
generally used and that was drunk with a
moderation much less known among the more
modern highlanders a cup to the memory 
the deceased chieftain was the first pledge solemnly
proclaimed after the banquet was finished
 and a low murmur benedictions was
heard from the company while the monks
alone uplifting their united voices sung requiem
eternal dona an unusual silence followed
as if something extraordinary was expected
when eachin arose with a bold and manly yet
modest grace and ascended the vacant seat or
throne saying with dignity and firmness 
this seat and my father's inheritance i
claim as my right so prosper me god and st
barr 
how will you rule your father's children 
said an old man the uncle the deceased
i will defend them with my father's sword
and distribute justice to them under my father's
banner
the old man with a trembling hand unsheathed
the ponderous weapon and holding
it by the blade offered the hilt to the young
chieftain's grasp at the same time torquil 
the oak unfurled the pennon the tribe and
swung it repeatedly over eachin's head who
with singular grace and dexterity brandished
the huge claymore as in its defence the guests
raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance
 the patriarchal chief who claimed their
allegiance nor was there any who in the graceful
and agile youth before them was disposed
to recollect the subject sinister vaticinations
as he stood in glittering mail resting on the
long sword and acknowledging by gracious
gestures the acclamations which rent the air
within without and around simon glover
was tempted to doubt whether this majestic
figure was that the same lad whom he had
often treated with little ceremony and began
to have some apprehension the consequences
 having done so a general burst minstrelsy
succeeded to the acclamations and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes as lately to
shout and yell woe
it would be tedious to pursue the progress 
the inaugural feast or detail the pledges that
were quaffed to former heroes the clan and
above all to the twentynine brave gallowglas
ses who were to fight in the approaching conflict
under the eye and leading their young
chief the bards assuming in old times the
prophetic character combined with their own
ventured to assure them the most distinguished
victory and to predict the fury with
which the blue falcon the emblem the clan
quhele should rend to pieces the mountaincat
the wellknown badge the clan chattan
it was approaching sunset when a bowl called
the gracecup made oak hooped with
silver was handed round the table as the signal
 dispersion although it was left free to
any who chose a longer carouse to retreat to
vol iii h
any the outer bothies as for simon glover
the booshalloch conducted him to a small hut
contrived it would seem for the use a single
individual where a bed heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit
and an ample supply such delicacies as the
late feast afforded showed that all care had
been taken for the inhabitant's accommodation

do not leave this hut said the booshal
loch taking leave his friend and protege
this is your place rest but apartments are
lost on such a night confusion and if the badger
leaves his hole the tod will creep into it
to simon glover this arrangement was by
no means disagreeable he had been wearied
by the noise the day and felt desirous repose
after eating therefore a morsel which
his appetite scarce required and drinking a cup
 wine to expel the cold he muttered his
evening prayer wrapt himself in his cloak and
lay down on a couch which old acquaintance
toil scoitice for fox
had made familiar and easy to him the hum
and murmur and even the occasional shouts 
some the festive multitude who continued
revelling without did not long interrupt his repose
 and in about ten minutes he was as fast
asleep as if he had lain in his own bed in curfew
street
chapter 
colonies still harping on my daughter
hamlet
two hours before the blackcock crew simon
glover was wakened by a wellknown
voice which called him by name
what conachar he replied as he started
from sleep is the morning so far advanced
and raising his eyes the person whom
he was dreaming stood before him and at the
same moment the events yesterday rushing
on his recollection he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned
it and it was not the mailclad highland chief
with claymore in hand as he had seen him the
preceding night but conachar curfew street
in his humble apprentice's garb holding in his
hand a switch oak an apparition would not
more have surprised our perth burgher ashe
gazed with wonder the youth turned upon
him a piece lighted bogwood which he carried
in a lantern and to his waking exclamation
replied 
essen so father simon it is conachar
come to renew our old acquaintance when our
intercourse will attract least notice
so saying he sat down on a tressel which
answered the purpose a chair and placing
the lantern beside him proceeded in the most
friendly tone
i have tasted thy good cheer many a
day father simon i trust thou hast found no
lack in my family 
none whatever eacbin maclan answered
the glover for the simplicity the celtic
language and manners rejects all honorary
titles it was even too good for this fasting
season and much too good for me since i must
be ashamed to think how hard you fared in
curfew street
even too good to use your own word
said conachar for the deserts an idle apprentice
and for the wants a young highlander
but yesterday if there was as i trust
enough food found you not good glover
some lack courteous welcome excuse it not
i know you did so but i am young in authority
with my people and i must not too early
draw their attention to the period my residence
in the lowlands which however i can
never forget
i understand the cause entirely said simon
 and therefore it is unwillingly and as
it were by force that i have made so early
a visit hither
hush father hush it is well you are
come to see some my highland splendour
while it yet sparkles return after palm sunday
and who knows whom or what you may
find in the territories we now possess the
wildcat may have made his lodge where the
banquetting bower mac ian now stands
the young chief was silent and pressed the
top the rod to his lips as if to guard against
uttering more
there is no fear that eachin said simon
in that vague way in which lukewarm
comforters endeavour to turn the reflection 
their friends from the consideration inevitable
danger
there is fear and there is peril utter
ruin answered eachin and there is positive
certainty great loss i marvel my father
consented to this wily proposal albany i
would mac gillie chattachan would take with
me and then instead wasting our best blood
against each other we would go down together
to stratford and kill and take possession i
would rule at perth and he at dundee and all
the great strath should be our own to the
banks the faith tay such is the policy
i have caught from your old grey head father
simon when holding a trencher at thy back
and listening to thy evening talk with bailie
craigdallie
the tongue is well called an unruly member
thought the glover here have i been
holding a candle to the devil to show him the
way to mischief
but he only said aloud these plans come
too late
too late indeed answered eachin the
indentures battle are signed by our marks
and seals the burning hate the clan quhele
and clan chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable
flame by mutual insults and boasts
yes the time is passed by but to thine own
affairs father glover it is religion that has
brought thee hither as i learn from niel booshallow
surely my experience thy prudence
did not lead me to suspect thee any quarrel
with mother church as for my old acquaintance
father clement he is one those who
hunt after the crown martyrdom and think
a stake surrounded with blazing faggots better
worth embracing than a willing bride he is a
very knighterrant in defence his religious
notions and does battle wherever he comes he
hath already a quarrel with the monks sibyl's
isle yonder about some point doctrine
hast seen him 
i have answered simon but we spoke
little together the time being pressing
 he may have said that there is a third person
 one more likely i think to be a true fugitive
for religion than either you a shrewd citizen
or he a wrangling preacher who would
be right heartily welcome to share our protection
 thou art dull man and wilt not guess
my meaning thy daughter catharine 
these last words the young chief spoke in
english and he continued the conversation in
that language as if apprehensive being overheard
 and indeed as if under the sense some
involuntary hesitation
my daughter catharine said the glover
remembering what the carthusian had told him
is well and safe
but where or with whom said the young
chief and wherefore came she not with
you think you the clan quhele have no
callimachus as active as old dorothy whose hand
has warmed my habits before now to wait upon
the daughter their chieftains master 
again i thank you said the glover and
doubt neither your power nor your will to protect
my daughter as well as myself but an
honourable lady the friend sir patrick charters
hath offered her a safe place refuge
without the risk a toilsome journey through
a desolate and distracted country
oh ay sir patrick charteris said eachin
in a more reserved and distant tone he
must be preferred to all men without doubt he
is your friend i think 
simon glover longed to punish this affectation
 a boy who had been scolded four times
aday for running into the street to see sir patrick
charteris ride past but he checked his
spirit repartee and simply said 
 sir patrick charteris has been provost 
perth for seven years and it is likely is so
still since the magistrates are elected not in
lent but at st martinmas
ah father glover said the youth in his
kinder and more familiar mode address
 you are so used to see the sumptuous shows
and pageants perth that you would but little
relish our barbarous festival in comparison
what didst thou think our ceremonial yesterday

it was noble and touching said the glover
 and to me who knew your father most
especially so when you rested on the sword
and looked around you methought i saw mine
old friend gilchrist mac ian arisen from the
dead and renewed in years and in strength
i played my part there boldly i trust and
showed little that paltry apprentice boy
whom you used to use just as he deserved
eachin resembles conachar said the glover
 no more than a salmon resembles a par
though men say they are the same fish in a
different state or than a butterfly resembles
a grub
thickest thou that while i was taking upon
me the power which all women love i would
have been myself an object for a maiden's eye
to rest upon to speak plain what would catharine
have thought me in the ceremonial 
we approach the shallows now thought simon
glover and without nice pilotage we
drive right on shore
most women like show eachin but i
think my daughter catharine be an exception
she would rejoice in the good fortune her
household friend and playmate but she would
not value the splendid maclan captain clan
quhele more than the orphan conachar
she is ever generous and disinterested
replied the young chief but yourself father
have seen the world for many more years
than she has done and can better form a judgment
what power and wealth do for those who
enjoy them think and speak sincerely what
would be your own thoughts if you saw your
catharine standing under yonder canopy with
the command over an hundred hills and the
devoted obedience ten thousand vassals and
as the price these advantages her hand in
that the man who loves her the best in the
world
meaning in your own conachar said
simon
ay conachar call me i love the name
since it was by that i have been known to catharine

sincerely then said the glover endeavouring
to give the least offensive turn to his
reply my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that catharine and i were safe in
our humble booth in curfew street with dorothy
for our only vassal
and with poor conachar also i trust 
you would not leave him to pine away in solitary
grandeur 
i would not answered the glover wish
so ill to the clan quhele mine ancient friends
as to deprive them at a moment emergency
 a brave young chief and that chief the
fame which he is about to acquire at their head
in the approaching conflict
eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated
feelings as he replied words words 
empty words father simon you fear the
clan quhele more than you love them and
you suppose their indignation would be formidable
should their chief marry the daughter
 a burgess perth
and if i do fear such an issue hector
maclan have i not reason how have illassorted
marriages had issue in the house macaw
in that the powerful maclean nay
 the lords the isles themselves what
has ever come them but divorce and exhortation
 sometimes worse fate to the ambitious
intruder you could not marry my child
before a priest and you could only wed her with
your left hand and i he checked the strain
 impetuosity which the subject inspired and
concluded and i am an honest though
humble burgher perth who would rather
my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse
 a citizen in my own rank than the licensed
concubine a monarch
i will wed catharine before the priest and
before the world before the altar and before
the black stones long said the impetuous
young man she is the love my youth and
there is not a tie in religion or honour but i
will bind myself by them i have sounded my
people if we do but win this combatant with
the hope gaining catharine we shall win it
my heart tells me so i shall be so much lord
over their affections that were i to take a bride
from the almshouse so it was my pleasure
they would hail her as if she were a daughter
 maccallanmore but you reject my suit 
said eachin sternly
you put words offence in my mouth
said the old man and may next punish me
for them since i am wholly in your power but
with my consent my daughter shall never wed
save in her own degree her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes 
bloodshed which connect themselves with your
lot if you really love her and recollect her
dread strife and combat you would not wish
her to be subjected to the train military horrors
in which you like your father must needs
be inevitably and eternally engaged choose a
bride amongst the daughters the mountain
chiefs my son or fiery lowland nobles you
are fair young rich highborn and powerful
and will not woo in vain you will readily find
one who will rejoice in your conquests and
cheer you under defeat to catharine the one
would be as frightful as the other a warrior
must wear a steel gauntlet a glove kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour
a dark cloud passed over the face the
young chief lately animated with so much
fire
farewell he said the only hope which
could have lighted me to fame or victory 
he remained for a space silent and intensely
thoughtful with downcast eyes a lowering
brow and folded arms at length he raised
his hands and said father for such you
have been to me i am about to tell you a secret
reason and pride both advise me to be
silent but fate urges me and must be obeyed
i am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man
but beware this conference how it will
beware how you ever breathe a syllable 
what i am now to trust to you for know
that were you to do so in the most remote corner
 scotland i have ears to hear it even
there and a hand and poniard to reach a traitor's
bosom i am but the word will not out 
do not speak it then said the prudent
glover a secret is no longer safe when it
crosses the lips him who owiis it and i desire
not a confidence so dangerous as you menace
me with
ay but i must speak and you must hear
said the youth in this age battle father
you have yourself been a combatant 
once only replied simon when the
southron assaulted the fair city i was summoned
to take my part in the defence as my
tenure required like that other craftsmen
who are bound to keep watch and ward
and how felt you upon that matter inquired
the young chief
what can that import to the present business
 said simon in some surprise
much else had i not asked the question
answered eachin in the tone haughtiness
which from time to time he assumed
 an old man is easily brought to speak 
olden times said simon not unwilling on an
vol iii i
instant's reflection to lead the conversation
away from the subject his daughter and
i must needs confess my feelings were much
short the high cheerful confidence nay the
pleasure with which i have seen other men goto
battle my life and profession were peaceful
and though i have not wanted the spirit 
a man when the time demanded it yet i have
seldom slept worse than the night before that
onslaught my ideas were harrowed by the
tales we were told nothing short the truth
about the saxon archers how they drew shafts
 a clothyard length and used bows a third
longer than ours when i fell into a broken
slumber if but a straw in the mattress pricked
my side i started and waked thinking an
english arrow was quivering in my body in
the morning as i began for very weariness to
sink into some repose i was waked by the tolling
 the common bell which called us burghers
to the walls i never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since
go on what further chanced demanded
eachin
i did on my harness said simon such as
it was took my mothers blessing a highspirited
woman who spoke my father's actions
for the honour the fair town this heartened
me and i felt still bolder tvhen i found myself
ranked among the other crafts all bowmen
for thou knowest the perth citizens have good
skill in archery we were dispersed on the walls
several knights and squires in armour proof
being mingled amongst us who kept a bold
countenance confident perhaps in their harness
and informed us for our encouragement that
they would cut down with their swords and
axes any those who should attempt to quit
their post i was kindly assured this myself
by the old kempe kinfauns as he was called
this good sir patrick's father then our provost
he was a grandson the red rover
tom montreville and a likely man to keep
his word which he addressed to me in especial
because a night much discomfort may have
made me look paler than usual and besides i
was but a lad
and did his exhortation add to your fear
or your resolution said eachin who seemed
very attentive
to my resolution answered simon for
i think nothing can make a man so bold to face
one danger at some distance in his front as
the knowledge another close behind him
to push him forward well i mounted the
walls in tolerable heart and was placed with
others on the spey tower being accounted a
good bowman but a very cold fit seized me as
i saw the english in great order with their
archers in front and their menatarms behind
marching forward to the attack in strong columns
three in number they came on steadily
and some us would fain have shot at
them but it was strictly forbidden and we were
obliged to remain motionless sheltering ourselves
behind the battlement as we best might
as the southron formed their long ranks into
lines each man occupying his place as by magic
and preparing to cover themselves by large
shields called passes which they planted before
them i again felt a strange breathlessness
and some desire to go home for a glass distilled
waters but as i looked aside i saw the
worthy kempe kinfauns bending a large crossbow
and i thought it pity he should waste the
bolt on a truehearted scotsman when so many
english were in presence so i e'en staid where
i was being in a comfortable angle formed by
two battlements the english then strode forward
and drew their bowstrings not to the
breast as your highland kerne do but to the
ear and sent off their volleys swallowtails
before we could call on st andrew i winked
when i saw them haul up their tackle and i
believe i started as the shafts began to rattle
against the parapet but looking round me and
seeing none hurt but john squalls the towncrier
whose jaws were pierced through with
a clothyard shaft i took heart grace and
shot in my turn with good will and good aim
a little man i shot at who had just popped out
from behind his target dropt with a shaft
through his shoulder the provost cried 
well stitched simon glover saint john
for his own town my fellow craftsmen 
shouted i though i was then but an apparent
the honour our guild and if you
will believe me in the rest the skirmish which
was ended by the foes drawing off i drew bowstring
and loosed shaft as calmly as if i had
been shooting at butts instead men's breasts
i gained some credit and i have ever afterwards
thought that in case necessity for with me
it had never been matter choice i should not
have lost it again and this is all i can tell 
warlike experience in battle other dangers i
have had which i have endeavoured to avoid
like a wise man or when they were inevitable
i have faced them like a true one upon other
terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
scotland
i understand your tale said eachin but
i shall find it difficult to make you credit mine
knowing the race which i am descended and
especially him whom we have this day laid in
the tomb well that he lies where he will never
learn what you are now to hear look my father
 the light which i bear grows short and
pale a few minutes will extinguish it but before
it expires the hideous tale will be told 
father i am a coward it h said at last
and the secret my disgrace is in keeping 
another 
the young man sunk back in a species syncope
produced by the agony his mind as he
made the fatal communication the glover
moved as well by fear as by compassion applied
himself to recall him to life and succeeded in
doing so but not in restoring him to composure
he hid his face with his hands and his tears
flowed plentifully and bitterly
for our lady's sake be composed said
the old man and recall the vile word i know
you better than yourself you are no coward
but only too young and inexperienced ay and
somewhat too quick fancy to have the steady
valour a bearded man i would hear no
other man say that you conachar without
gidng him the lie you are no coward i have
seen high sparks spirit fly from you even on
slight enough provocation
high sparks pride and passion said the
unfortunate youth but when saw you them
supported by the resolution that should have
backed them the sparks you speak fell on
my dastardly heart as on a piece ice which
could catch fire from nothing if ray offended
pride urged me to strike my weakness mind
prompted me the next moment to fly
want habit said simon it is by
clambering over walls that youths learn to scale
precipices begin with slight feuds exercise
daily the arms your country in tourney with
your followers
and what leisure is there for this exclaimed
the young chief starting as if something
horrid had occurred to his imagination
how many days are there betwixt this hour
and palm sunday and what is to chance then 
a list inclosed from which no man can stir
more than the poor bear who is chained to his
stake sixty living men the best and fiercest
one alone excepted which albyn can send
down from her mountains all athirst for each
other's blood while a king and his nobles and
shouting thousands besides attend as at a theatre
to encourage their demoniac fury blows
clang and blood flows thicker faster redder 
they rush on each other like madmen they tear
each other like wild hearts the wounded are
trodden to death amid the feet their companions
 blood ebbs arms become weak but
there must be no parley no truce no interruption
while any the maimed wretches remain
alive here is no crouching behind battlements
no fighting with missile weapons all is hand
to hand till hands can no longer be raised to
maintain the ghastly conflict if such a field
is so horrible in idea what think you it will be
in reality 
the glover remained silent
i say again what think you 
i can only pity you conachar said simon
 it is hard to be the descendant a lofty
line the son a noble father the leader by
birth a gallant array and yet to want or
think you want for still i trust the fault lies
much in a quick fancy that overestimates danger
to want that dogged quality which is possessed
by every gamecock that is worth a handful
 corn every hound that is worth a mess
 offal but how chanced it that with such a
consciousness inability to fight in this battle
you proffered even now to share your chief dom
with my daughter your power must depend on
your fighting this combat and in that catharine
cannot help you
you mistake old man replied eachin 
were catharine to look kindly on the earnest
love i bear her it would carry me against the
front the enemies with the mettle a warhorse
overwhelming as my sense weakness
is the feeling that catharine looked on would
give me strength say yet oh say yet she
shall be mine if we gain the combat and not
the gow chrom himself whose heart is a
piece with his anvil ever went to battle so light
as i shall do one strong passion is conquered
by another
this is folly conachar cannot the recollections
 your interest your honour your
kindled do as much to stii your courage as
the thoughts a brent browed lass fie upon
you man 
you tell me but what i have told myself 
but it is in vain replied eachin with a sigh
it is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous
be it from constitution be it as our highland
callimachus will say front the milk the
white doe be it from my peaceful education
and the experience your strict restraint be
it as you think from an overheated fancy
which paints danger yet more dangerous and
ghastly than it is in reality i cannot tell but
i know my failing and yes it must be said 
so sorely dread that i cannot conquer it that
could i have your consent to my wishes on such
terms i would caen here make a pause renounce
the rank i have assumed and retire into
humble life
what turn glover at last conachar said
simon this beats the legend st crispin
nay nay your hand was not framed for that 
you shall spoil me no more doeskins
jest not said eachin i am serious
if i cannot labour i will bring wealth enough
to live without it they will proclaim me recreant
with horn and warpipe let them do
so catharine will love me the better that i
have preferred the paths peace to those 
bloodshed and father clement shall teach us
to pity and forgive the world which will load
us with reproaches that wound not i shall
be the happiest men catharine will enjoy
all that unbounded affection can confer upon
her and will be freed from apprehension 
the sights and sounds horror which your
illassorted match would have prepared for her 
and you father glover shall occupy your
chimneycorner the happiest and most honoured
man that ever 
hold eachin i pr'ythee hold said the
glover the fir light with which this discourse
must terminate burns very low and i
would speak a word in my turn and plain dealing
is best though it may vex or perhaps enrage
you let me these visions by saying at
once catharine can never be yours a glove
is the emblem faith and a man my craft
should therefore less than any other break his
own catharine's hand is promised promised
to a man whom you may hate but whom you
must honour to henry the armourer the
match is fitting by degree agreeable to their
mutual wishes and i have given my promise
it is best to be plain at once resent my refusal
as you will i am wholly in your power but
nothing shall make me break my word
the glover spoke thus decidedly because he
was aware from experience that the very irritable
disposition his former apprentice yielded
in most cases to stern and decided resolution
yet recollecting where he was it was
with some feelings fear that he saw the dying
flame leap up and spread a flash light
on the visage eachin which seemed pale
as the grave while his eye rolled like that 
a maniac in his fever fit the light instantly
sunk down and died and simon felt a momentary
terror lest he should have to dispute
for his life with the youth whom he knew to
be capable violent actions when highly excited
however short a period his nature could
support the measures which his passion commenced
he was relieved by the voice eachin
who muttered in a hoarse and altered
tone 
let what we have spoken this night rest
in silence for ever if thou hring'st it to light
thou wert better dig thine own grave
thus speaking the door the hut opened
admitting a gleam moonshine the form 
the retiring chief crossed it for an instant the
hurdle door was then closed and the hut left
in darkness
simon glover felt relieved when a conversation
fraught with offence and danger was
thus peaceably terminated but he remained
deeply affected by the condition hector marian
whom he had himself bred up
the poor child said he to be called upto
a place eminence only to be hurled from
it with contempt what he told me i partly
knew having often remarked that conachar
was more prone to quarrel than to fight but
this overpowering faintheartiness which neither
shame nor necessity can overcome i
though no sir william wallace cannot conceive
and to propose himself for a husband to
my daughter as if a bride were to find courage
for herself and the bridegroom no no catharine
must wed a man to whom she may say
 husband spare your enejny not one in
whose behalf she must cry generous enemy
spare my husband 
tired out with these reflections the old man
at length fell asleep in the morning he was
awakened by his friend the booshalloch who
with something a blank visage proposed to
him to return to his abode on the meadow at
the ballough that is the discharge the lake
into the river he apologized that the chief
could not see simon glover that morning being
busied with things about the expected combat
 and that eachin maclan thought the residence
at the ballough would be safest for simon
glover's health and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection
and accommodation
niel booshalloch dilated on these circumstances
to gloss over the neglect implied in the
chief's dismissing bis visitor without a particular
audience
his father knew better said the herdsman
 but where should he have learned
manners poor thing and bred up among your
perth burghers who excepting yourself neighbour
glover who speak gaelic as well as i do
are a race incapable civility 
simon glover it may be well believed felt
none the want respect which his friend
resented on his account on the contrary he
greatly preferred the quiet residence the
good herdsman to the tumultuous hospitality
 the daily festival the chief even if there
had not just passed an interview with eachin
upon a subject which it would be most painful
to revive
to the ballough therefore he quietly retreated
where could he have been secure catharine's
safety his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough his amusement was sailing on the
lake in a little skiff which a highland boy managed
while the old man angled he frequently

ly landed on the little island where be mused
over the tomb his old friend gilchrist marian
and made friends with the monks presenting
the prior with gloves martin's fur and
the superior officers with each them a pair
made from the skin the wildcat the cutting
and stitching these little presents served
to beguile the time after sunset while the
family the herdsman crowded around admiring
his address and listening to the tales
and songs vith which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening
it must be confessed that the cautious glover
avoided the conversation father clement
whom he erroneously considered as rather the
author his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer
 them i will not he thought to please his
fancies lose the good will these kind monks
which may be one day useful to me i have
suffered enough by his preachments already i
trow little the wiser and much the poorer
have they made me no no catharine and
clement may think as they will but i will take
the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated
vol iii k
hound at the call his master submit to a
plentiful course haircloth and whipcord
disburse a lusty mulct and become whole with
the church again
more than a fortnight had passed since the
glover had arrived at ballough and he began
to wonder that he had not heard news catharine
or henry wynd to whom he concluded
the provost had communicated the plan
and place his retreat he knew the stout
smith dared not come up into the clan quhele
country on account various feuds with the
inhabitants and with each in himself while
bearing the name conachar but yet the
glover thought henry might have found means
to send him a message or a token by some one
 the various couriers who passed and repassed
between the court and the headquarters the
clan quhele in order to concert the terms 
the impending combat the march the parties
to perth and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment it was now the middle 
march and the fatal palm sunday was fast approaching

whilst time was thus creeping on the exiled
glover had not even once set eyes upon his
former apprentice the care that was taken
to attend to his wants and convenience in every
respect showed that he was not forgotten but
yet when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing
through the woods he usually made it a point
to choose his walk in a different direction one
morning however he found himself unexpectedly
in eachin's close neighbourhood with
scarce leisure to avoid him and thus it happened

as simon strolled pensively through a little
sylvan glade surrounded on either side with
tall forest trees mixed with underwood a white
doe broke from the thicket closely pursued by
two deer greyhounds one which griped her
haunch the other her throat and pulled her
down within half a furlong the glover who
was something startled at the suddenness the
incident the near and piercing blast a
horn and the baying a slowhound made
simon aware that the hunters were close behind
and on the trace the deer hallooing
and the sound men running through the copse
were heard close at hand a moment's recollection
would have satisfied simon that his best
way was to stand fast or retire slowly and
leave it to eachin to acknowledge his presence
or not as he should see cause but his desire
 shunning the young man had grown into a
kind instinct and in the alarm finding
him so near simon hid himself in a bush 
hazels mixed with holly which altogether concealed
him he had hardly done so ere eachin
rosy with exercise dashed from the thicket into
the open glade accompanied by his fosterfather
torquil the oak the latter with equal
strength and address turned the struggling
hind on her back and holding her fore feet in
his right hand while he knelt on her body offered
his skene with the left to the young
chief that he might cut the animal's throat
it may not be torquil do thine office and
take the assay thyself i must not kill the
likeness my fostermother
this was spoken with a melancholy smile
while a tear at the same time stood in the
speaker's eye torquil stared at his young
chief for an instant then drew his sharp woodknife
across the creature's throat with a cut
so swift and steady that the weapon reached
the back bone then rising on his feet and
again fixing a long piercing look on his chief
he said as much as i have done to that
hind would i do to any living man whose ears
could have heard my fault fosterson so much
as name a white doe and couple the word with
hector's name 
if simon had no reason before to keep himself
concealed this speech torquil furnished
him with a pressing one
it cannot be concealed father torquil
said eachin it will all out to the broad day
what will out what will to broad day 
asked torquil in surprise
it is the fatal secret thought simon and
now if this huge privy councillor cannot keep
silence i shall be made answerable i suppose
for eachin's disgrace having been blown
abroad
thinking thus anxiously he availed himself
at the same time his position to see as much
as he could what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confident impelled by that
spirit curiosity which prompts us in the most
momentous as well as the most trivial occasions
 life and which is sometimes found to
subsist in company with great personal fear
as torquil listened to what eachin communicated
the young man sank into his arms and
supporting himself on his shoulder concluded
his confession by a whisper into his ear torquit
seemed to listen with such amazement as
to make him incapable crediting his ears
as if to be certain that it was eachin who
spoke he gradually roused the youth from his
reclining posture and holding him up in some
measure by a grasp on bis shoulder fixed on
him an eye that seemed enlarged and at the
same time turned to stone by the marvels he
listened to and so wild waxed the old man's
visage after he had heard the murmured communication
that simon glover apprehended he
would cast the youth from him as a dishonoured
thug ill which case he might have lighted
on the very copse in which he lay concealed
and occasioned his discovery in a manner equally
painful and dangerous but the passions 
torquil who entertained for his fosterchild
even a double portion that passionate fondness
which always attends that connexion in
the highlands took a different turn
i believe it not he exclaimed it is
false thy father's child false thy mother's
son falsest my fault i offer my gage to
heaven and hell and will maintain the combat
with him that shall call it true thou hast been
spellbound by an evil eye my darling and
the fainting which you call cowardice is the
work magic i remember the bat that struck
the torch out on the hour that thou wert born
that hour grief and joy cheer up my
beloved thou shalt with me to zona and the
good st columbus with the whole choir 
blessed saints and angels who ever favoured
thy race shall take from thee the heart the
white doe and return that which they have
stolen from thee
eachin listened with a look as if he would
fain have believed the words the comforter
but torquil he said supposing this
might avail us the fatal day approaches and
if i go to the lists i dread me we shall be
shamed
it cannot be it shall not said torquil
hell shall not prevail so far we will steep
thy sword in holy water place vervain st
john'swort and rowantree in thy crest we
will surround thee i and thy eight brethren 
thou shalt be safe as in a castle
again the youth helplessly muttered something
which from the dejected tone in which
it was spoken simon could not understand
while torquil's deep tones in reply fell full and
distinct upon his ear
yes there may be a chance withdrawing
thee from the conflict thou art the youngest
who is to draw blade now hear me and
thou shalt know what it is to have a fosterfather's
love and how far it exceeds the love even
 kind the youngest on the indenture the
clan chattan is ferquhard day his father
slew mine and the red blood is seething hot
between us i looked to palm sunday as the
term that should cool it but mark thou
would'st have thought that the blood in the
veins this ferquhard day and in mine would
not have mingled had they been put into the
same vessel yet hath he cast the eyes his love
upon my only daughter eva the fairest our
maidens think with what feelings i heard the
news it was as if a wolf from the skirts 
arragon had said give me thy child in wedlock
torquil my child thought not thus she
loves ferquhard and weeps away her colour
and strength in dread the approaching battle
let her give him but a sign favour and well
i know he will forget kith and kin forsake the
field and fly with her to the desert
he the youngest the champions clan
chattan being absent i the youngest the
clan quhele may be excused from combat
said eachiu blushing at the mean chance 
safety thus opened to him
see now my chief said torquil and
judge my thoughts towards thee others might
give thee their own lives and that their sons
i sacrifice to thee the honour my house
my friend my father repeated the chief
folding torquil to his bosom what a base
wretch am i that have a spirit dastardly enough
to avail myself your sacrifice 
t speak not that green woods have ears
let us back to the camp and send our gillies
for the venison back dogs and follow at
heel
the slowhound or lymedog luckily for simon
had drenched his nose in the blood the
deer else he might have found the glover's lair
in the thicket but its more acute properties 
scent being lost it followed tranquilly with the
gazehounds
when the hunters were out sight and hearing
the glover arose greatly relieved by their
departure and began to move off in the opposite
direction as fast as his age permitted his
first reflection was on the fidelity the fosterfather

the wild mountain heart is faithful and
true yonder man is more like the giants in
romaunt than a man mould like ourselves
and yet christians might take an example from
him for his lealt a simple contrivance this
though to finger a man off their enemies chequer
as if there would not be twenty the
wildcats ready to supply his place
thus thought the glover not aware that the
strictest proclamations were issued prohibiting
any the two contending clans their friends
allies and dependents from coming within fifty
miles perth during a week before and a
week after the combat which regulation was to
be enforced by armed men
so soon as our friend simon arrived at the
habitation the herdsman he found other news
awaiting him they were brought by father
clement who came in a pilgrim's cloak or
dalmatic ready to commence his return to the
southwards and desirous to take leave his
companion in exue or to accept him as a travelling
companion
but what said the citizen has so suddenly
induced you to return within the reach
 danger 
have you not heard said father clement
that march and his english allies having retired
into england before the earl douglas
the good earl has applied himself to redress the
evils the commonwealth and hath written to
the court letters desiring that the warrant for
the high court commission against heresy be
withdrawn as a trouble to men's consciences 
that the nomination robert de wardle to be
prelate st andrews be referred to the parliament
with sundry other things pleasing to
the commons now most the nobles that
are with the king at perth and with them sir
patrick charteris your worthy provost have
declared for the proposals the douglas the
duke albany hath agreed to them whether
from goodwill or policy i know not the good
king is easily persuaded to mild and gentle
courses and thus are the jawteeth the oppressors
dashed to pieces in their sockets and
the prey snatched from their ravening talons
will you with me to the lowlands or do you
abide here a little space 
niel booshalloch saved bis friend the trouble
 reply
he bad the cheers authority he said
for saying that simon glover should abide
until the champions went down to the battle
in this answer the citizen saw something not
quite consistent with his own perfect freedom 
volition but he cared little for it at the time
as it furnished a good apology for not travelling
along with the clergyman
an exemplary man he said to his friend
niel booshalloch as soon as father clement
had taken leave a great scholar and a great
saint it is a pity almost he is not in danger
to be burned as his sermon at the stake would
convert thousands o niel booshalloch father
clement's pile would be a sweet savouring
sacrifice and a beacon to all devout christians
but what would the burning a barrel ignorant
burgess like me serve men offer not up
old glove leather for incense nor are beacons
fed with undressed hides i trow sooth to
speak i have too little learning and too much
fear to get credit by the affair and therefore
i should in our homely phrase have both the
scathe and the scorn
true for you answered the herdsman
chapter vii
we must return to the characters our dramatic
narrative whom we left at perth when
we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
to kinfauns and from that hospitable mansion
traced the course simon to loch tay 
and the prince as the highest personage claims
our immediate attention this rash and inconsiderate
young man endured with some impatience
his sequestered residence with the lord
high constable with whose company otherwise
in every respect satisfactory he became
dissatisfied from no other reason than that he
held in some degree the character his warvigo

der incensed against his uncle and displeased
with his father he longed not unnaturally for
the society sir john ramorny on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself
for amusement and though he would have resented
the imputation as an insult for guidance
and direction he therefore sent him a summons
to attend him providing his health permitted
and directed him to come by water to
a little pavilion in the high constable's garden
which like that sir john's own lodgings
ran down to the tay in renewing an intimacy
so dangerous rothsay only remembered
that he had been sir john ramorny's munificent
friend while sir john on receiving the
imitation only recollected on his part the
capricious insults he had sustained from his patron
the loss his hand and the lightness
with which he had treated the subject and the
readiness with which rothsay had abandoned
his cause in the matter the bonnetmaker's
slaughter he laughed bitterly when he read
the prince's billet
eviot he said mau a stout boat with
six trusty men trusty men mark me lose
not a moment and bid d wining instantly come
hither heaven smiles on us my trusty friend
he said to the medicine i was but beating
my brains how to get access to this fickle boy
and here he sends to invite me
hem i see the matter very clearly said
d wining heaven smiles on some untoward
consequences he he he 
no matter the trap is ready and it is baited
too my friend with what would lure the boy
from a sanctuary though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard yet is
it scarce necessary his own weariness himself
would have done the job get thy matters
ready thou goes with us write to him as
i cannot that we come instantly to attend his
commands and do it clerkly he reads welland
that he owes to me
he will be your valiancy's debtor for more
knowledge before he dies he he he but
is your bargain sure with the duke albany 
vol iii l
 enough to gratify my ambition thy avarice
and the revenge both aboard aboard
and speedily let eviot throw in a few flasks 
the choicest wine and some cold baked meats
but your arm my lord sir john does
it not pain you 
 the throbbing my heart silences the
pain my wound it beats as it would burst
ray bosom
heaven forbid said dwining adding
in a low voice it would be a strange sight if
it should i should like to dissect it save that
its stony case would spoil my best instruments

in a few minutes they were in the boat
while a speedy messenger carried the note to
the prince
rothsay was seated with the constable after
their noontide repast he was sullen and silent
and the earl had just asked whether it
was his pleasure that the table should be cleared
when a note delivered to the prince changed
at once his aspect
 as you will he said i go to the pavilion
in the garden always with permission
 my lord constable to receive my late master
 the horse
 my lord said lord errol
 ay my lord must i ask permission twice 
 no surely my lord answered the constable
 but has your royal highness recollected
that sir john ramorny 
has not the plague i hope replied the
duke rothsay come errol you would
play the surly turnkey but it is not in your
nature farewell for half an hour
a new folly said errol as the prince
flinging open a lattice the groundparlour in
which they sate stept out into the garden a
new folly to call back that villain to his councils
but he is infatuated
the prince in the meantime looked back
and said hastily 
your lordship's good housekeeping will afford
us a flask or two and a slight collation in
the pavilion i love the al fresco the river
the constable bowed and gave the necessary
orders so that sir john found the materials
 good cheer ready displayed when landing
from his barge he entered the pavilion
it grieves my heart to see your highness
under restraint said ramorny with a wellexecuted
appearance sympathy
 that grief thine will grieve mine said
the prince i am sure here has errol and
a right truehearted lord he is so tired me with
grave looks and something like grave lessons
that he has driven me back to thee thou reprobate
from whom as i expect nothing good i
may perhaps obtain something entertaining
yet ere we say more it was foul work that
upon the eastern's even ramorny i well hope
thou gayest not aim to it
on my honour my lord a simple mistake
 the brute bonthron i did but hint to him
that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by
whom i had lost a hand and lo you my knave
makes a double mistake he takes one man for
another and instead the barton he uses the
axe
it is well that it went no farther small matter
for the bonnetmaker but i had never forts

given you had the armourer fallen there is not
his match in britain but i hope they hanged
the villain high enough 
if thirty feet might serve replied ramorn

pah no more him said rothsay his
wretched name makes the good wine taste 
blood and what are the news in perth ramorn
 how stands it with the bona robes
and the galliard 
little halliards stirring my lord answered
the knight all eyes are turned to the
motions the black douglas who comes with
five thousand chosen men to put us all to rights
as if he were bound for another otterburn it
is said he is to be lieutenant again it is certain
many have declared for his faction
it is time then my feet were free said
rothsay otherwise i may find a worse warder
than errol
ah my lord were you once away from
this place you might make as bold a head as
douglas
ramorny said the prince gravely i
have but a confused remembrance your once
having proposed something horrible to me beware
 such counsel i would be free i would
have my person at my own disposal but i will
never levy arms against my father nor those it
pleases him to trust
 it was only for your royal highnesses personal
freedom that i was presuming to speak
answered ramorny were i in your grace's
place i would get me into that good boat which
hovers on the tay and drop quietly down to
fife where you have many friends and make
free to take possession falkland it is a royal
castle and though the king has bestowed it in
gift on your uncle yet surely even if the grant
were not subject to challenge your grace might
make free with the residence so near a relative

he hath made free with mine said the
duke as the stewartry renfrew can telli
but stay ramorny hold did i not hear errol
say that the lady marjory douglas whom
they call duchess rothsay is at falkland i
would neither dwell with that lady nor insult
her by dislodging her
the lady was there my lord replied ramorn
 but i have sure advice that she is
gone to meet her father
ha to animate the douglas against me 
or perhaps to beg him to spare me providing i
come on my knees to her bed as pilgrims say
the emirs and admirals upon whom a saracen
soldan bestows a daughter in marriage are
bound to do ramorny i will act by the douglas's
own saying it is better to hear the lark
sing than the mouse squeak i will keep both
foot and hand from fetters
no place fitter than falkland replied ramorn
 i have enough good yeomen to
keep the place and should your highness wish
to leave it a brief ride reaches the sea in three
directions
you speak well but we shall die gloom
yonder neither mirth music nor maidens
 said the heedless prince
pardon me noble duke but though the
lady marjory douglas be departed like an errant
dame in romance to implore succour 
her doughty sire there is i may say a lovelier
i am sure a younger maiden cither presently
at falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither your highness has not forgotten the
fair maid perth 
 forget the prettiest wench in scotland 
no any more than thou hast forgotten the hand
that thou hadst in the curfew street onslaught
on st valentine's eve
the hand that i had your highness
would say the hand that i lost as certain
as i shall never regain it catharine glover is
or will soon be at falkland i will not flatter
your highness by saying she expects to meet
you in truth she proposes to place herself under
the protection the lady marjory
the little traitress said the prince she
too to turn against me she deserves punishment
ramorny
i trust your grace will make her penance
a gentle one replied the knight
faith i would have been her father confessor
long ago but i have ever found her coy
opportunity was lacking my lord replied
ramorny and time presses even now
nay i am but too apt for a frolic but my
father 
he is personally safe said ramorny
and as much at freedom as ever he can be 
while your highness 
must brook fetters conjugal or literal i
know it yonder comes douglas with his
daughter in his hand as haughty and as harshfeatured
as himself bating touches age
and at falkland sits in solitude the fairest
wench in scotland said ramorny here
is penance and restraint yonder is joy and freedom

thou hast prevailed most sage counsellor
replied rothsay but mark you it shall bethe
last my frolics
i trust so replied ramorny for when
at liberty you may make a good accommodation
with your royal father
i will write to him ramorny get the writ
 no i cannot put my thoughts
in words do thou write
your royal highness forgets said ramorn
pointing to his mutilated arm
ah that cursed hand yours what
can we do 
 so please your highness answered his
counsellor if you would use the hand the
medicine dwining he writes like a clerk
hath he a hint the circumstances is he
possessed them 
fully said ramorny and stepping to
the window he called dwining from the boat
he entered the presence the prince scotland
creeping as if he trode upon eggs with
downcast eyes and a frame that seemed shrunk
up by a sense awe produced by the occasion
there fellow are writingmaterials i will
make trial you thou know'st the case 
place my conduct to my father in a fair light
dwining sat down and in a few minutes
wrote a letter which he handed to sir john
ramorny
why the devil has aided thee dwining
said the knight listen my dear lord 
respected father and liege sovereign know
that important considerations induce me to take
my departure from this your court purposing
to make my abode at falkland both as the seat
 my dearest uncle albany with whom i know
your majesty would desire me to use all familiarity
and as the residence one from whom
i have been too long estranged and with whom
i haste to exchange vows the closest affection
from henceforward
the duke rothsay and ramorny laughed
aloud and the physician who had listened
to his own scroll as if it were a sentence 
death encouraged by their applause raised his
eyes uttered faintly his chuckling note he 
he and was again grave and silent as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds reverent respect

admirable said the prince admirable
 the old man will apply all this to the
duchess as they call her rothsay d wining
thou should'st be a secrets to his holiness the
pope who sometimes it is said wants a scribe
that can make one word record two meanings
i will subscribe it and have the praise the
device
and now my lord said ramorny sealing
the letter and leaving it behind will you
not to boat 
not till my chamberlain attends vail some
clothes and necessaries and you may call my
sewer also
my lord said ramorny time presses
and preparation will but excite suspicion your
officers will follow with the mails tomorrow
for tonight i trust my poor service may suffice
to wait on you at table and chamber
nay this time it is thou who forgets said
the prince touching the wounded arm with his
walkingrod recollect man thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point a goodly
sewer or valet the mouth 
ramorny grinned with rage and pain for his
wound though in a way healing was still
highly sensitive and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble
will your highness now be pleased to take
boat
not till i take leave the lord constable
rothsay must not slip away like a thief from
a prison from the house errol summon
him hither
my lord duke said ramorny it maybe
dangerous to our plan
to the devil with danger thy plan and
thyself i must and will act to errol as becomes
us both
the earl entered agreeable to the prince's
summons
i gave you this troublemy lord said
rothsay with the dignified courtesy which he
knew so well how to assume to thank you for
your hospitality and your good company i can
enjoy them no longer as pressing affairs call me
to falkland
 my lord said the lord high constable
i trust your grace remembers that you are
under ward
how under ward if i am a prisoner
speak plainly if not i will take my freedom
to depart
 i would my lord your highness would
request his majesty's permission for this journey
there will be much displeasure
mean you displeasure against yourself my
lord or against me 
i have already said your highness lies inward
here but if you determine to break it i
have no warrant god forbid to put force on
your inclinations i can but entreat your
highness for your own sake 
 my own interests i am the best judge 
good evening to you my lord
the wilful prince stepped into the boat with
dwining and ramorny and waiting for no
other attendance eviot pushed off the vessel
which descended the tay rapidly by the assistance
 sail and oar and the ebbtide
for some space the duke rothsay appeared
silent and moody nor did his companions interrupt
his reflections he raised his head at
length and said my father loves a jest and
when all is over he will take this frolic at no
more serious rate than it deserves a fit 
youth with which he will deal as he has with
others yonder my masters shows the old
hold kinfauns frowning above the tay
now tell me john ramorny how thou hast
dealt to get the fair maid perth out the
hands yonder bullheaded provost for errol
told me it was rumoured that she was under his
protection
truly she was my lord with the purpose
 being transferred to the patronage the
duchess i mean the lady marjory 
douglas now this beetleheaded provost who
is after all but a piece blundering valiancy
has like most such a retainer some slyness
and cunning whom he uses in all his dealings
and whose suggestions he generally considers as
his own ideas whenever i would possess myself
 a landward baron i address myself to
such a confident who in the present case is
called kitt henshaw an old skipper upon the
tay and who having in his time sailed as far
as ampere holds with sir patrick charteris
the respect due to one who has seen foreign
countries this his agent i have made my own
and by his means have insinuated various apologies
in order to postpone the departure 
catharine for falkland
but to what good purpose 
i know not if it is wise to tell your highness
lest you should disapprove my views 
i meant the officers the commission for inquiry
into heretical opinions should have found
the fair maid at kinfauns for our beauty is a
peevish selfwilled swerve from the church 
and certes i designed that the knight should
have come in for his share the fines and confiscations
that were about to he inflicted the
monks were eager enough to be at him seeing
he hath had frequent disputes with them about
the salmon ty the
but wherefore wouldst thou have ruined
the knight's fortunes and brought the beautiful
young woman to the stake perchance 
pshaw my lord duke monks never
burn pretty maidens an old woman might
have been in some danger and as for my lord
provost as they call him if they had clipped off
some his fat acres it would have been some
atonement for the brave he put on me in saint
john's church
methinks john it was but a base revenge
said rothsay
rest ye contented my lord he that cannot
right himself by the hand must use his
head well that chance was over by the tenderhearted
douglas's declaring in favour 
tender conscience and then my lord old hens


shaw found no further objections to carrying
the fair maid perth to falkland not to
share the dulness the lady marjory's society
as sir patrick charteris and she herself doth
opine but to keep your highness from tiring
when we return from hunting in the park
there was again a long pause in which the
prince seemed to muse deeply at length he
spoke ramorny i have a scruple in this
matter but if i name it to thee the devil sophistry
with which thou art possessed will argue
it out me as it has done many others this
girl is the most beautiful one excepted whom
i ever saw or knew and i like her the more
that she bears some features elizabeth 
dunbar but she i mean catharine glover is
contracted and presently to be wedded to henry
the armourer a craftsman unequalled for skill
and a manatarms yet unmatched in the barrace
to follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong
your highness will not expect me to be
very solicitous henry smith's interest said
ramorny looking at his wounded arm
vol iii m

by saint andrew with his shored cross
this disaster thine is too much harped upon
john ramorny others are content with putting
a finger into every man's pie but thou
must thrust in thy whole gory hand it is
done and cannot be undone let it be forgotten

nay my lord you allude to it more frequently
than i answered the knight in derision
it is true while i but i can be silent
on the subject if i cannot forget it
well then i tell thee that i have scruple
about this intrigue dost thou remember when
we went in a frolic to hear father clement
preach or rather to see this fair heretic that he
spoke as touchingly as a minstrel about the rich
man taking away thepoor man's onlyewe lamb
a great matter indeed answered sir
john that this churl's wife's eldest son
should be fathered by the prince scotland 
how many earls would covet the like fate for
their fair countesses and how many that have
had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse
for it
 and if i might presume to speak said the
medicine the ancient laws scotland assigned
such a privilege to every feudal lord over
his female vassals though lack spirit and love
 money hath made many exchange it for gold
i require no argument to urge me to be
kind to a pretty woman but this catharine has
been ever cold to me said the prince
nay my lord said ramorny if young
handsome and a prince you know not how to
make yourself acceptable to a fine woman it is
not for me to say more
and if it were not far too great audacity
in me to speak again i would say quoth the
leech that all perth knows that the goto
chrom never was the maiden's choice but fairly
forced upon her by her father i know for
certain that she refused him repeatedly
nay if thou canst assure us that the
case is much altered said rothsay vulcan
was a smith as well as harry wynd he would
needs wed venus and our chronicles tell us
what came it
 then long may lady venus live and he
worshipped said sir john ramorny and
success to the gallant knight mars who goes
awooing to her goddessship 
the discourse took a gay and idle turn for a
few minutes but the duke roth say soon
dropped it i have left he said yonder
air the prisonhouse behind me and yet my
spirits scarce revive i feel that drowsy not
unpleasing yet melancholy mood that comes
over us when exhausted by exercise or satiated
with pleasure some music now stealing on
the ear yet not loud enough to make us lift the
eye were a treat for the gods
your grace has but to speak your wishes
and the nymphs the tay are as favourable as
the fair ones upon the shore hark it is a
lute
a lute said the duke rothsay listening
 it is and rarely touched i should remember
that dying fall steer towards the boat
from whence the music comes
it is old henshaw said ramorny working
up the stream how skipper 
the boatmen answered the hail and drew up
alongside the prince's barge
ol ho my old friend said the prince
recognising the figure as well as the appointments
 the french glee woman louise i
think i owe thee something for being the means
 thy having a fright at least upon st valentine's
day into this boat with thee lute
puppy dog scrip and all i will prefer thee to
a lady's service who shall feed thy very cur on
capons and canary
i trust your highness will consider said
ramorny
i will consider nothing but my pleasure
john pray do thou be so complying as to
consider it also
is it indeed to a lady's service yoa would
promote me said the gleemaiden and
where does she dwell 
at falkland answered the prince
oh i have heard that great lady said
louise and will you indeed prefer me to
your right royal consort's service 
i will by my honour whenever i receive
her as such mark that reservation john said
he aside to ramorny
the persons who were in the boat caught up
the tidings and concluding a reconciliation was
about to take place betwixt the royal couple
exhorted louise to profit by her good fortune
and add herself to the duchess rothsay's
train several offered her some acknowledgment
for the exercise her talents
during this moment delay ramorny whispered
to d wining make in knave with some
objection this addition is one too many rouse
thy wits while i speak a word with henshaw
if i might presume to speak said dining
 as one who have made my studies both
in spain and arabia i would say my lord that
the sickness has appeared in edinburgh and
that there may be risk in admitting this young
wanderer into your highness's vicinity
ah and what is it to thee said rothsay
whether i choose to be poisoned by the pestilence
or the pothecary must thou too needs
thwart my humour 
while the prince thus silenced the remonstrances
 dwining sir john ramorny had
snatched a moment to learn from henshaw that
i
the removal the duchess rothsay from
falkland was still kept profoundly secret and
that catharine glover would arrive there that
evening or the next morning in expectation 
being taken under the noble lady's protection
the duke rothsay deeply plunged in
thought received this intimation so coldly that
ramorny took the liberty remonstrating
this my lord he said is playing the spoiled
child fortune you wish for liberty it
comes you wish for beauty it awaits you with
j must so much delay as to render the boon more precious
even your slightest desires seem a law to
the fates for you desire music when it seems
most distant and the lute and song are at your
hand these things so sent should be enjoyed
else we are but like petted children who break
and throw from them tle toys they have wept
themselves sick for
 to enjoy pleasure ramorny said the
prince a man should have suffered pain as
it requires fasting to gain a good appetite we
who can have all for a wish little enjoy that
all when we have possessed it seest thou yonder
thick cloud which is about to burst to rain 
it seems to stifle me the waters look dark
and lurid the shores have lost their beautiful
form 
my lord forgive your servant said ramorn
 you indulge a powerful imagination
as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to
rear until he falls back on his master and crushes
him i pray you shake off this lethargy shall
the gleemaiden make some music 
let her but it must be melancholy all
mirth would at this moment jar on my ear
the maiden sung a melancholy dirge in norman
french the words which the following
is an imitation were united to a tune as
doleful as they are themselves

yes thou may'st sigh
and look once more at all around
at stream and bank and sky and ground
thy life its final course has found
and thou must die
yes lay thee down
and while thy struggling pulses flutter
bid the gray monk his soulmass mutter
and the deep bell its deathtone utter
thy life is gone

be not afraid
tis but a pang and then a thrill
a fever tit and then a chill 
and then an human ill
for thou art dead
the prince made no observation on the music
 and the maiden at ramorny's beck went
on from time to time with her minstrel craft
until the evening sunk down into rain first
soft and gentle at length in great quantities
and accompanied by a cold wind there was
neither cloak nor covering for the prince and
he sullenly rejected that which ramorny offered

it is not for rothsay to wear your cast
garments sir john this melted snow which i
feel pierce me to the very marrow i am now
encountering by your fault why did you presume
to put off the boat without my servants
and apparel 
ramorny did not attempt an exculpation for
he knew the prince was in one those humours
when to enlarge upon a grievance was
more pleasing to him than to have his mouth
stopped by any reasonable apology in sullen silence
or ainid unsuppressed chiding the boat arrived
at the fishing village newbury the
party landed and found horses in readiness
which indeed ramorny had long since provided
for the occasion their quality underwent the
prince's bitter sarcasm expressed to ramorny
sometimes by direct words oftener by bitter
gibes at length they were mounted and rode
on through the closing night and the falling
rain the prince leading the way with reckless
haste the glee maiden mounted by his express
order attended them and well for her
that accustomed to severe weather and exercise
both on foot and horseback she supported
as firmly as the men the fatigues the nocturnal
ride ramorny was compelled to keep at the
prince's rein being under no small anxiety lest
in his wayward fit he might ride off from him
entirely and taking refuge in the house 
some loyal baron escape the snare which was
spread for him he therefore suffered inexpressibly
during the ride both in mind and in
body
at length the forest falkland received
them and a glimpse the moon showed the
dark and huge tower an appendage royalty
itself though granted for a season to the duke
 albany on a signal given the drawbridge
fell torches glared in the courtyard menials
attended and the prince assisted from horseback
was ushered into an apartment where ramorn
waited on him together with dwining
and entreated him to take the leech's advice
the duke rothsay repulsed the proposal
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared and
having stood for some time shivering in his
dank garments beside a large blazing fire he
retired to his apartment without taking leave
 any one
you see the peevish humour this childish
boy now said ramorny to dwining eek europe wide from sea to sea
bat bonny bluecap still for me i
i've seen amain's proud champions prance
have seen the gallant knights france
unrivall'd with the sword and lance 
have seen the sons england true
wield the brown bill and bend the yew
search france the fair and england free
but bonny bluecap still for me 
in short though louise's disreputable occupation
would have been in other circumstances an
objection to catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company yet forced together as they now
were she found her a humble and accommodating
associate
they lived in this manner for four or five
days and in order to avoid as much as possible
the gaze and perhaps the incivility the menials
in the offices they prepared their food in
their own apartment in the absolutely necessary
intercourse with domestics louise more
accustomed to expedients bolder by habit and
desirous to please catharine willingly took on
herself the trouble getting from the panther
the materials their slender meal and arranging
it with the dexterity her country
the gleewoman had been abroad for this
purpose upon the sixth day a little before noon 
and the desire fresh air or the hope to find
some sallad or potherbs or at least an early
flower or two with which to deck their board
had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle she reentered her apartment
in the tower with a countenance pale as ashes
and a frame which trembled like an aspenleaf
her terror instantly extended itself to catharine
who could hardly find words to ask what new
misfortune had occurred
is the duke rothsay dead 
 worse they are starving him alive
madness woman 
no no no no said louise speaking under
her breath and huddling her words so thick
upon each other that catharine could hardly
catch the sense i was seeking for flowers to
dress your potage because you said you loved
them yesterday my poor little dog thrusting
himself into a thicket yew and holly bushes
that grow out some old ruins close to the
castlewall came back whining and howling 
i crept forward to see what might be the cause
and oh i heard a groaning as one in extreme
pain but so faint that it seemed to arise
t
out the very depth the earth at length
i found it proceeded from a small rent in the
wall covered with ivy and when i laid my ear
close to the opening i could hear the prince's
voice distinctly say it cannot now last long
and then it sunk away in something like a
prayer
gracious heaven did you speak to him
i said is it you my lord and the answer
was who mocks me with that name 
i asked him if i could help him and he answered
with a voice i shall never forget food 
food i die famine so i came hither to
tell you what is to be done shall we alarm
the house 
alas that were more likely to destroy than
to aid him said catharine
and what then shall we do said louise
i know not yet said catharine prompt
and bold on occasions moment though yielding
to her companion in ingenuity resource
on ordinary occasions i know not yet but
something we will do the blood bruce shall
not die unaided
so saying she seized the small cruise which
contained their soup and the meat which
it was made wrapped some thin cakes which
she had hated into the fold her plaid and
beckoning her companion to follow with a vessel
 milk also part their provisions she
hastened towards the garden
so oar fair vestal is stirring abroad said
the only man she met who was one the menials
 but catharine passed on without notice
or reply and gained the little garden without
farther interruption
louise indicated to her a heap ruins which
covered with underwood was close to the castlewall
it had probably been originally a projection
from the building and the small fissure
which communicated with the dungeon contrived
for air had terminated within it but the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay
and admitted a dim ray light to its recesses
although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torches
here is dead silence said catharine after
she had listened attentively for a moment 
 heaven and earth he is gone 
 we must risk something said her compact
ilion and ran her fingers over the strings her
guitar
a sigh was the only answer from the depth
 the dungeon catharine then ventured to
speak i am here my lord i am here with
food and drink
ha ramorny the jest comes too late
i am dying was the answer
his brain is turned and no wonder thought
catharine but whilst there is life there maybe
hope
it is i my lord catharine glover i have
food if i could pass it safely to you
 heaven bless thee i thought the pain was
over but it glows again within me at the name
 food
the food is here but how ah how can i
pass it to you the chink is so narrow the wallis
so thick yet there is a remedy i have it
quick louise cut me a willow bough the tallest
you can find
the gleemaiden obeyed and by means a
cleft in the top the wand catharine transmitted
several morsels the soft cakes soaked
in broth which served at once for food and fop
drink
the unfortunate young man ate little and
with difficulty but prayed for a thousand blessings
on the head his comforter i had destined
thee to be the slave my vices he said
and yet thou priest to become the preserver
 my life but away and save thyself
i will return with food as i shall see opportunity
said catharine just as the gleemaiden
plucked her sleeve and desired her to
be silent and stand close
both couched among the ruins and they
heard the voices ramorny and the physician
in close conversation
he is stronger than i thought said the former
in a low croaking tone how long held
out dalwolsey when the knight lauderdale
prisoned him in his castle hermitage 
for a fortnight answered dwining but
he was a strong man and had some assistance
by grain which fell from a granary above his
prisonhouse
were it not better the matter more
speedily the black douglas comes this way
t
he is not in albany's secret he will demand
to see the prince and all must be over ere he
comes
they passed on in their dark and fatal conversation

now gain we the tower said catharine to
her companion when she saw they had left the
garden i had a plan escape for myself 
i will turn it into one rescue for the prince
the deywoman enters the castle about vesper
time and usually leaves her cloak in the passage
as she goes into the panther's office with the
milk take thou the cloak muffle thyself close
and pass the warder boldly he is usually drunken
at that hour and thou wilt go as the deywoman
unchallenged through gate and along
bridge if thou bear thyself with confidence
then away to meet the black douglas he is
our nearest and only aid
but said louise is he not that terrible
lord who threatened me with shame and punishment

 believe it said catharine such as thou
or i never dwelt an hour in the douglas's memory
either for good or evil tell him that
his soninlaw the prince scotland dies 
treacherously famished in falkland castle
and thou wilt merit not pardon only but reward

i care not for reward said louise the
deed will reward itself but methinks to stay is
more dangerous than to go let me stay then
and nourish the unhappy prince and do you
depart to bring help if they kill me before you
return i leave you my poor lute and pray you
to be kind to my poor chariot
no louise replied catharine you are a
more privileged and experienced wanderer than
i do you go and if you find me dead on your
return as may well chance give my poor father
this ring and a lock my hair and say catharine
died in endeavouring to save the blood
 bruce and give this other lock to henry 
say catharine thought him to the last and
that if he has judged her too scrupulous touching
the blood others he will then know it
was not because she valued her own
they sobbed in each other's arms and the

intervening hours till evening were spent in endeavouring
to devise some better mode supplying
the captive with nourishment and in the
construction a tube composed hollow reeds
slipping into each other by which liquids might
be conveyed to him the bell the village
church falkland tolled to vespers the dey
or farmwoman entered with her pitchers to
deliver the milk for the family and to hear and
tell the news stirring she had scarcely entered
the kitchen when the female minstrel again
throwing herself in catharine's arms and assuring
her her unalterable fidelity crept in
silence down stairs the little dog under her
arm a moment after she was seen by the
breathless catharine wrapt in the dey woman's
cloak and walking composedly across the drawbridge

so said the warder you return early
tonight may bridget small mirth towards
in the hall ha wench sick times are sad
times 
hence perhaps dairywoman and dairy
i have forgotten my tallies said the readmitted
frenchwoman and will return in
the skimming a bowie
she went onward avoiding the village 
falkland and took a footpath which led through
the park catharine breathed freely and blessed
god when she saw her lost in the distance it
was another anxious hour for catharine which
occurred before the escape the fugitive was
discovered this happened so soon as the deygirl
having taken an hour to perform a task
which ten minutes might have accomplished
was about to return and discovered that someone
had taken away her grey frieze cloak a
strict search was set on foot at length the women
 the house remembered the gleemaiden
and ventured to suggest her as one not unlikely
to exchange an old cloak for a new one
the warder strictly questioned averred he saw
the deywoman depart immediately after vespers
 and on this being contradicted by the party
herself he could suggest as the only alternative
that it must needs have been the devil
as however the gleewoman could not be
vol iii p

found the real circumstances the case were
easily guessed at and the steward went to inform
sir john ramorny and dwining who
were now scarcely ever separate the escape 
one their female captives everything awakens
the suspicions the guilty they looked
on each other with faces dismay and then
went together to the humble apartment catharine
that they might take her as much as
possible by surprise while they inquired into
the facts attending louise's disappearance 
 where is your companion young woman
 said ramorny in a tone austere grar
city m
i have no companion here answered catharine

 trifle not replied the knight i mean
the gleemaiden who lately dwelt in this chamber
with you
 she is gone they tell me said catharine
gone about an hour since
and whither said dwining s
how answered catharine should i
know which way a professed wanderer may
choose to travel she was tired no doubt a
solitary life so different from the scenes 
feasting and dancing which her trade leads her
to frequent she is gone and the only wonder
is that she should have stayed so long
this then is all you have to tell us
all that i have to tell you sir john answered
catharine firmly and if the prince
himself inquire i can tell him no more
 there is little danger his again doing
you the honour to speak to you in person said
ramorny even if scotland should escape
being rendered miserable by the sad event 
his decease
 is the duke rothsay so very ill asked
catharine
 no help save in heaven answered ramorn
looking upward
then may there yet be help there said
catharine if human aid prove unavailing 
amen said ramorny with the most determined
gravity while dwining adopted a face
fit to echo the feeling though it seemed to cost
him a painful struggle to suppress his sneering
yet soft laugh triumph which was peculiarlyexcited
by anything having a religious tendency
and it bis men earthly men and not incarnate
devils who thus appeal to heaven while
they are devouring by inches the lifeblood 
their hapless master muttered catharine asher
two baffled inquisitors left the apartment 
why sleeps the thunder but it wih roll erelong
and oh may it be to preserve as well as
to punish 
the hour dinner alone afforded a space
when all in the castle being occupied with that
meal catharine thought she had the best opportunity
 venturing to the breach in the wall
with the least chance being observed in
waiting for the hour she observed some stir in
the castle which had been silent as the grave
ever since the seclusion the duke rothsay
the portcullis was lowered and raised and the
creaking the machinery was intermingled
with the tramp horse as menatarms went
out and returned with steeds hard ridden and
covered with foam she observed too that such
domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms all this made her heart throb
high for it augured the approach rescue and
besides the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever at length the hour noon
arrived she had taken care to provide under
pretence her own wishes which the panther
seemed disposed to indulge such articles 
food as could be the most easily conveyed to the
unhappy captive she whispered to intimate
her presence there was no answer she spoke
louder still there was silence
he sleeps she muttered these words half
aloud and with a shuddering which was succeeded
by a start and a scream when a voice
replied behind her 
yes he sleeps but it is for ever
she looked round sir john ramorny stood
behind her in complete armour but the visor
 his helmet was up and displayed a countenance
more resembling one about to die than
to fight he spoke with a grave tone something
between that a calm observer an interesting
event and one who is an agent and
partaker in it
catharine he said all is true which i
s
tell you he is dead you have done your best
for him you can do no more
i will not i cannot believe it said catharine
 heaven be merciful to me it would
make one doubt providence to think so great
a crime has been accomplished
 doubt not providence catharine though
it has suffered the profligate to fall by his own
devices follow me i have that to say which
concerns you i say follow for she hesitated
unless you prefer being left to the mercies 
the brute bonthron and the medicine henbane
dwining
i will follow you said catharine you
cannot do more to me than you are permitted
he led the way into the tower and mounted
staircase after staircase and ladder after ladder
catharine's resolution failed her i will
follow no farther she said whither would
you lead me if to my death i can die here
only to the battlements the castle fool
said ramorny throwing wide a barred door
which opened upon the vaulted roof the castle
where men were bending mangonels as they
called them military engines that is for throwing
arrows or stones getting ready crossbows
and piling stones together but the defenders
did not exceed twenty in number and catharine
thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them
catharine said ramorny i must not
quit this station which is necessary for my defence
 but i can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere
say on answered catharine i am prepared
to hear you
you have thrust yourself catharine into
a bloody secret have you the firmness to
keep it 
i do not understand you sir john answered
the maiden
look you i have slain murdered if you
will my late master the duke rothsay
the spark life which your kindness would
have fed was easily smothered his last words
called on his father you are faint bear up 
you have more to hear you know the crime
but you know not the provocation sec this
gauntlet is empty i lost my right hand in his
cause and when i was no longer fit to serve
him i was cast off like a wornout hound my
loss ridiculed and a cloister recommended instead
 the halls and palaces in which i had
my natural sphere think on this pity and
assist me
in what manner can you require my assistance
 said the trembling maiden i can neither
repair your loss nor cancel your crime
thou canst be silent catharine on what
thou hast seen and heard in yonder thicket it
is but a brief oblivion i ask you whose word
will i know be listened to whether you say
such things were or were not that your
mountebank companion the foreigner none will
hold to be a pinpoint's value if you grant
me this i will take your promise for my security
and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it if you will not promise silence i
defend this castle till every one perishes and i
fling you headlong from these battlements ay
look at them it is not a leap to be rashly braved
seven courses stairs brought you up
hither with fatigue and shortened breath but
you shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer
time than you can breathe a sigh speak the
word fair maid for you speak to one unwilling
to harm you but determined in his purpose
catharine stood terrified and without power
 answering a man who seemed so desperate 
but she was saved the necessity reply by the
approach d wining he spoke with the same
humble cones which at all times distinguished
his manner and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer which gave that manner the lie
i do you wrong noble sir to intrude on
your valiancy when engaged with a fair damsel
but i come to ask a trifling question
speak tormentor said ramorny ill
news are sport to thee even when they affect
thyself so that they concern others also
hem he he i only desired to know if
your knighthood proposed the chivalrous task
 defending the castle with your single hand
i crave pardon i meant your single arm
the question is worth asking for i am good for
little to aid the defence unless you could prevail

oil the besiegers to take physic he he he 
and bonthron is as drunk as ale and strong
waters can make him and you he and i makeup
the whole garrison who are disposed for resistance

 how will the other dogs not fight
said ramorny
never saw men who showed less stomach
to the work answered dwining never but
here come a brace them venit extrema dies
he he he f
eviot and his companion b uncle now approached
with sullen resolution in their faces
like men who had made their minds up to deny
that authority which they had so long obeyed
how now said ramorny stepping forward
to meet them wherefore from your
posts why have you left the barbican eliot
 and you other fellow did i not charge
you to look to the mangonels 
we have something to tell you sir john
ramorny answered eviot we will not fight
in this quarrel
how my own squires control me said
ramorny
we were your squires and pages my lord
while you were master the duke rothsay's
household it is bruited about the duke
no longer lives we desire to know the truth
what traitor dares spread such falsehoods
said ramorny
all who have gone out to skirt the forest
my lord and i myself among others bring back
the same news the minstrel woman who left
the castle yesterday has spread the report everywhere
that the duke rothsay is murdered
or at death's door the douglas comes on us
with a strong force 
and you cowards take advantage an idle
report to forsake your master said ramorny
indignantly
 my lord said eviot let buncle and
myself see the duke rothsay and receive
his personal orders and if we do not fight to
the death in defence the castle i will consent
to be hanged on its highest turret but if hebe
gone by natural disease we will yield up the
castle to the earl douglas who is they say
the king's lieutenant or if which heaven
forefend the noble prince has had foul play
we will not involve ourselves in the guilt 
using arms in defence the murderers be they
who they will i
 eviot said ramorny raising his mutilated
arm had not that glove been empty thou
hadst not lived to utter two words this insolence

it is as it is answered eviot and we
do but our duty i have followed you long my
lord but here i draw bridle ot
farewell then and a curse light on all 
you exclaimed the incensed baron let my
horse be brought forth 
our valiancy is about to run away said
the medicine who had crept close to catharine's
side before she was aware catharine
thou art a superstitious fool like most women 
nevertheless thou hast some mind and i speak
to thee as one more understanding than the
buffaloes which are herding about us these
haughty barons who overstrained the world what
are they in the day adversity chaff before
the wind let their sledgehammer hands or
their column resembling legs have injury and
bah the menatarms are gone heart and
courage is nothing to them lithe and limb everything
 give them animal strength what are they
better than furious bulls take that away and
your hero chivalry lies grovelling like the
brute when he is hamstrung not so the sage 
while a grain sense remains in a crushed or
mutilated frame his mind shall be strong as
ever catharine this morning i was practising
your death but methinks i now rejoice that
you may survive to tell how the poor medicine
the pillgilder the mortarpounder the poisonvender
met his fate in company with the gallant
knight ramorny baron in possession and
earl lindores in expectation god save his
lordship 
old man said catharine if thou be indeed
so near the day thy deserved doom
other thoughts were far wholesome than the
vainglorious ravings a vain philosophy 
ask to see a holy man 
yes said dwining scornfully refer myself
to a greasy monk who does not he he 
ibs
he understand the barbarous latin he repeats
by rote such would be a fitting counsellor to one
who has studied both in spain and arabia no
catharine i will choose a confessor that is pleasant
to look upon and you shall be honoured
with the office now look yonder at his valiancy
 his eyebrow drops with moisture his
lip trembles with agony for his valiancy he 
he he is pleading for his life with his late
domestics and has not eloquence enough to
persuade them to let him slip see how the
fibres his face work as he implores the ungrateful
brutes whom he has heaped with obligations
to permit him to get such a start for his
life as the hare has from the greyhounds when
men course her fairly look also at the sullen
downcast dogged faces with which fluctuating
between fear and shame the domestic traitors
deny their lord this poor chance for his life these
things thought themselves the superior a manlike
me and you foolish wench think so meanly
 your deity as to suppose wretches like
them are the work omnipotence 
 no man evil no said catharine
warmly the god i worship created these men
with the attributes to know and adore him to
guard and defend their fellowcreatures to practise
holiness and virtue their own vices and
the temptations their one have made them
such as they now are oh take the lesson home
to thine own heart adamant heaven made
thee wiser than thy fellows gave thee eyes to
look into the secrets nature a sagacious heart
and a skilful hand but thy pride has poisoned
all these fair gifts and made an ungodly atheist
 one who might have been a christian sage 
atheist say'st thou answered dwining
perhaps i have doubts on that matter but
they will be soon solved yonder comes one
who will send me as he has done thousands to
the place where all mysteries shall be cleared
catharine followed the medicine's eye up one
 the forest glades and beheld it occupied by a
body horsemen advancing at full gallop in
the midst was a pennon displayed which though
its bearings were not visible to catharine was
by a murmur around acknowledged as that 
the black douglas they halted within arrowshot
 the castle and a herald with two trumpets
advanced up to the main portal whereafter
a loud flourish he demanded admittance
for the high and dreaded archibald earl 
douglas lord lieutenant the king and acting
for the time with the plenary authority 
his majesty commanding at the same time
that the inmates the castle should lay down
their arms all under penalty high treason
you hear said eviot to ramorny who
stood sullen and undecided will you give
orders to render the castle or must i 
no villain interrupted the knight to
the last i will command you open the gates
drop the bridge and render the castle to the
douglas
now that's what may be called a gallant
exertion free will said d wining just
as if the pieces brass that were screaming a
minute since should pretend to call those notes
their own which are breathed through them by
a frowsy trumpeter
wretched man said catharine either
be silent or turn thy thoughts to the eternity
on the brink which thou art standing
and what is that to thee answered dining
 thou canst not wench help hearing
what i say to thee and thou wilt tell it again
for thy sex cannot help that either perth and
all scotland shall know what a man they have
lost in henbane dwining 
the clash armour now announced that the
new comers had dismounted and entered the
castle and were in the act disarming the
small garrison earl douglas himself appeared
on the battlements with a few his followers
and signed to them to take ramorny and dining
into custody others dragged from some
nook the stupefied bonthron
it was to these three that the custody 
the prince was solely committed during his
alleged illness said the douglas prosecuting
an inquiry which he had commenced in the
hall the castle
no other saw him said eviot though
i offered my services
conduct us to the duke's apartment and
bring the prisoners with us also there should
be a female in the castle if she hath not been
vol iii j
murdered or spirited away the companion 
the gleemaiden who brought the first alarm
she is here my lord said eviot bringing
catharine forward
her beauty and her agitation made some impression
even upon the impassible earl
 fear nothing maiden he said thou
hast deserved both praise and reward tell tome
as thou would'st confess to heaven the
things thou hast witnessed in this castle
few words served catharine to unfold the
dreadful story
it agrees said the douglas with the
tale the gleemaiden from point to point 
now show us the prince's apartment
they passed to the room which the unhappy
duke rothsay had been supposed to inhabit 
but the key was not to be found and the earl
could only obtain entrance by forcing the door
on entering the wasted and squalid remains 
the unhappy prince were discovered flung on
the bed as if in haste the intention the
murderers had apparently been to arrange the
dead body so as to resemble a timely parted
corpse but they had been disconcerted by the
alarm occasioned by the escape louise douglas
looked on the body the misguided youth
whose wild passions and caprice's had brought
him to this fatal and premature catastrophe
i had wrongs to be redressed he said 
but to see such a sight as this banishes all
remembrance injury 
he he it should have been arranged
said d wining more to your omnipotence's
pleasure but you came suddenly on us and
hasty masters make slovenly service
douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner
said so closely did he examine the wan and
wasted features and stiffened limbs the
dead body before him catharine overcome
by sickness and fainting at length obtained
permission to retire from the dreadful scene
and through confusion every description
found her way to her former apartment where
she was locked in the arms louise who had
returned in the interval
the investigations douglas proceededthe
dying hand the prince was found to be
clenched upon a lock hair resembling in coil

lour and texture the coalblack bristles bonthrone
thus though famine had begun the
work it would seem that rothsay's death had
been finally accomplished by violence the
private stair to the dungeon the keys which
were found at the subaltern assassin's belt the
situation the vault its communication with
the external air by the fissure in the walls and
the wretched lair straw with the fetters
which remained there fully confirmed the
story catharine and the glee woman
we will not hesitate an instant said the
douglas to his near kinsman the lordbalveny
as soon as they returned from the dungeon
away with the murderers hang them over
the battlements
but my lord some trial may be fitting
answered balcony
to what purpose answered douglas i
have taken them redhand my authority will
stretch to instant execution yet stay have
we not some redwood men in our troop 
plenty turnbulls rutherford aisles
and so forth said balcony
call me an inquest these together they
are all good men and true saving a little shifting
for their living do thou see to the execution
 these felons while i hold a court in the
great hall and we'll try whether the jury or the
provostmarshal do their work first we will
have jed wood justice hang in haste and try
at leisure
yet stay my lord said ramorny you
may rue your haste will you grant me a word
out earshot 
not for worlds said douglas speak
out what thou hast to say before all that are
here present
know all then said ramorny aloud that
this noble earl had letters from the duke 
albany and myself sent him by the hand 
yon cowardly deserter buncle let him deny
it if he dare counselling the removal the
duke for a space from court and his seclusion
in this castle falkland
but not a word replied douglas sternly
smiling his being flung into a dungeon 
famished strangled away with the wretches
balveny they pollute god's air too long 
the prisoners were dragged off to the battlements
but while the means execution were
in the act being prepared the apothecary
expressed so ardent a desire to see catharine
once more and as he said for the good his
soul that the maiden in hopes his obduracy
might have undergone some change even at
the last hour consented again to go to the
battlements and face a scene which her heart
recoiled from a single glance showed her
bonthron sunk in total and drunken insensibility
ramorny stripped his armour endeavouring
in vain to conceal fear while he
spoke with a priest whose good offices he had
solicited and dwining the same humble 
crouching individual she had
always known him he held in his hand a little
silver pen with which he had been writing on
a scrap parchment
catharine he said he he he j wish
to speak to thee on the nature my religious
faith
if such be thy intention why lose time
with me speak with this good father
the good father said dvviuiug is he
he already a worshipper the deity whom
i have served i therefore prefer to give the
altar mine idol a new worshipper in thee catharine
this scrap parchment will tell thee
how to make your way into my chapel where
i have worshipped so often in safety i leave
the images which it contains to thee as a legacy
simply because i hate and contemn thee something
less than any the absurd wretches
whom i have hitherto been obliged to call fellowcreatures
and now away or remain and
see if the the quacksalver belies his life
our lady forbid said catharine
nay said the medicine i have but a
single word to say and yonder nobleman's valiancy
may hear it if he will
lord balveny approached with some curiosity
for the undaunted resolution a man who
never wielded sword or bore armour and was
in person a poor dwindled dwarf had to him an
air something resembling sorcery
you see this trifling implement said the
criminal showing the silver pen by means
 this i can escape the power even the black
douglas aiiiii mm
give him no ink nor paper said balveny
hastily he will draw a spell
not so please your wisdom and valiancy
he he he said dwining with his usual
chuckle as he unscrewed the top the pen
within which was a piece sponge or some such
substance no bigger than a pea now mark
this said the prisoner and drew it between
his lips the effect was instantaneous he lay
a dead corpse before them the contemptuous
sneer still on his countenance
catharine shrieked and fled seeking by a
hasty descent an escape from a sight so appalling
lord balveny was for a moment stupefied
and then exclaimed this may be glamour
 hang him over the battlements quick or
dead if his foul spirit hath only withdrawn
for a space it shall return to a body with a
dislocated neck
his commands were obeyed ramorny and
bonthron were then ordered for execution the
last was hanged before he seemed quite to come

pretend what was designed to be done with
him ramorny pale as death yet with the
same spirit pride which had occasioned his
ruin pled his knighthood and demanded the
privilege dying by the sword and not by the
noose ad d sad
 the douglas never alters his doom said
balveny but thou shalt have all thy rights 
send the cook hither with a cleaver the menial
whom he called appeared at his summons
what shakes thou for fellow said balcony
 here strike me this man's gilt spurs from
his heels with thy cleaver and now john
ramorny thou art no longer a knight but a
knave to the halter with him provostmarshal
 hang him betwixt his companions and
higher than them if it may be
in a quarter an hour afterwards balveny
descended to tell the douglas that the criminals
were executed
then there is no further use in the trial
said the earl how say you good men 
inquest were these men guilty high treason 
ay or no 
guilty exclaimed the obsequious inquest
with edifying unanimity we need no farther
evidence
sound trumpets and to horse then with
our own train only and let each man keep silence
on what has chanced here until the proceedings
shall be laid before the king which
cannot conveniently be till the battle palm
sunday shall be fought and ended select our
attendants and tell each man who either goes
with us or remains behind that he who prates
dies
in a few minutes the douglas was on horseback
with the followers selected to attend his
person expresses were sent to his daughter
the widowed duchess rothsay directing her
to take her course to perth by the shores 
lochleven without approaching falkland and
committing to her charge catharine glover and
the gleewoman as persons whose safety he
tendered
as they rode through the forest they looked
back and beheld the three bodies hanging like
specks darkening the walls the old castle
the band is punished said douglas but
who shall arraign the head by whose direction
the act was done 
you mean the duke albany said balvery

i do kinsman and were i to listen to the
dictates my heart i would charge him with
the deed which i am certain he has authorized
but there is no proof it beyond strong suspicion
and albany has attached to himself the
numerous friends the house stewart to
whom indeed the imbecility the king and
the ill regulated habits rothsay left no other
choice a leader were i therefore to break
the band which i have so lately formed with albany
the consequence must be civil war an
event ruinous to poor scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity the percy
backed by the treachery march no balveny
the punishment albany must rest with
heaven which in its own good time will execute
judgment on him and on his house
chapter x
we are now to recall to our reader's recollection
that simon glover and his fair daughter
had been hurried from their residence without
having time to announce to henry smith
either their departure or the alarming cause 
it when therefore the lover appeared in curfew
street on the morning their flight instead
 the hearty welcome the honest burgher
and the april reception half joy half censure
which he had been promised on the part
 his lovely daughter he received only the astounding
intelligence that her father and she
had set off early on the summons a stranger
who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation to this dorothy whose talents for
forestalling evil and communicating her views
 it are known to the reader chose to add that
she had no doubt her master and young mistress
were bound for the highlands to avoid a
visit which had been made since their departure
by two or three apparitors who in the name 
a commission appointed by the king had
searched the house put seals upon such places
as were supposed to contain papers and left
citations for father and daughter to appear before
the court commission on a day certain under
pain outlawry all these alarming particulars
dorothy took care to state in the gloomiest
colours and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was that her master
had charged her to tell him to reside quietly at
perth and that he should soon hear news 
them this checked the smith's first resolve
which was to follow them instantly to the
highlands and partake the fate which they
might encounter
but when he recollected his repeated feuds
with divers the clan quhele and particularly
his personal quarrel with conachar who was
now raised to he a high chief he could not but
think on reflection that his intrusion on their
place retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy
there than be any service to them he was
well acquainted with simon's habitual intimacy
with the chief the clan quhele and justly
augured that the glover would obtain protection
which his own arrival might be likely
to disturb while his personal prowess could
little avail him in a quarrel with a whole tribe
 vindictive mountaineers at the same time
his heart throbbed with indignation when he
thought catharine being within the absolute
power young conachar whose rivalry
he could not doubt and who had now so many
means urging his suit what if the young
chief should make the safety the father depend
on the favour the daughter he distrusted
not catharine's affections but then
leer mode thinking was so disinterested and
her affection to her father so tender that if the
love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security or perhaps his life it was matter 
deep and awful doubt whether it might not be
found light in the balance tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell he resolved
nevertheless to remain at home stifle his
anxiety as he might and await the promised intelligence
from the old man it came but it
did not relieve his concern
sir patrick charteris had not forgotten his
promise to communicate to the smith the plans
 the fugitives but amid the bustle occasioned
by the movement troops he could
not himself convey the intelligence he therefore
intrusted to his agent kitt henshaw the
task making it known but this worthy
person as the reader knows was in the interest
 raraorny whose business it was to conceal
from every one but especially from a lover
so active and daring as henry the real place
 catharine's residence henshaw therefore announced
to the anxious smith that his friend the
glover was secure in the highlands and though
he affected to be more reserved on the subject
 catharine he said little to contradict the belief
that she as well as simon shared the protection
 the clan quhele but he reiterated
in the name sir patrick assurances that
father and daughter were both well and that
henry would best consult his own interest and
their safety by remaining quiet and waiting
the course events
with an agonized heart therefore henry
gow determined to remain quiet till he had
more certain intelligence and employed himself
in finishing a shirt mail which he intended
should be the best tempered and the most finely
polished that his skilful hands had ever executed
this exercise his craft pleased him better
than any other occupation which he could have
adopted and served as an apology for secluding
himself in his workshop and shunning society
where the idle reports which were daily circulated
served only to perplex and disturb him
he resolved to trust in the warm regard simon
the faith his daughter and the friends
hip the provost who having so highly commended
his valour in the combat with bonthrow
would never he thought desert him at
this extremity his fortunes time however
passed on day by day and it was not till
palm sunday was near approaching that sir
patrick charteris having entered the city to
make some arrangements for the ensuing combat
bethought himself making a visit to the
smith the wynd
he entered his workshop with an air sympathy
unusual to him and which made henry
instantly augur that he brought bad news
the smith caught the alarm and the uplifted
hammer was arrested in its descent upon the
heated iron while the agitated arm that wielded
it strong before as that a giant became
so powerless that it was with difficulty henry
was able to place the weapon on the ground
instead dropping it from his hand
my poor henry said sir patrick i
bring you but cold news they are uncertain
however and if true they are such as a brave
man like you should not take too deeply to
heart
vol iii r
in god's name my lord said henry i
trust you bring no evil news simon glover
or his daughter 
touching themselves said sir patrick
no they are safe and well but as to thee
henry my tidings are more cold kitt henshaw
has i think apprised thee that i had endeavoured
to provide catharine glover with a
safe protection in the house an honourable
lady the duchess rothsay but she hath
declined the charge and catharine hath been
sent to her father in the highlands what is
worst is to come thou mayest have heard that
gilchrist maclan is dead and that his son
eachin who was known in perth as the apprentice
 old simon by the name conachar
is now the chief clan quhelp and i heard
from one my domestics that there is a strong
rumour among the maclean that the young
chief seeks the hand catharine in marriage
my domestic learned this as a secret however
while in the breadalbane country on some arrangements
touching the ensuing combat the
thing is uncertain but henry it wears a face
 likelihood
 did your lordship's servant see simon
glover and his daughter said henry struggling
for breath and coughing to conceal from
the provost the excess his agitation
he did not said sir patrick the highlanders
seemed jealous and refused to permit
him to speak to the old man and he feared to
alarm them by asking to see catharine besides
he talks no gaelic nor had his informer much
english so there may be some mistake in the
matter nevertheless there is such a report and
i thought it best to tell it you but you maybe
well assured that the wedding cannot goon
till the affair palm sunday be over and
i advise you to take no step till we learn the
circumstances the matter for certainty is
most desirable even when it is a painful one
go you to the councilhouses he added after
a pause to speak about the preparations for
the lists in the north inch you will be welcome
there
no my good lord
well smith i judge by your brief answer
that you are discomposed with this matter
but after all women are weathercocks
that is the truth on't solomon and others have
proved it before you
and so sir patrick charteris retired fully
convinced he had discharged the office a comforter
in the most satisfactory manner
 with very different impressions did the unfortunate
lover regard the tidings and listen to
the consoling commentary
the provost he said bitterly to himself
 is an excellent man marry he holds his
knighthood so high that if he speaks nonsense
a poor man must hold it sense as he must praise
dead ale if it be handed to him in his lordship's
silver flaggon how would all this sound in
another situation suppose i were rolling down
the steep descent the corrichie diu and before
i came to the edge the rock comes my
lord provost and cries henry there is a deep
precipice and i grieve to say you are in the fairway
 rolling over it but be not downcast
for heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop
your progress however i thought it would be
comfort to you to know the worst which you

will be presently aware i do not know how
many hundred feet deep the precipice descends
but you may form a judgment when you are at
the bottom for certainty is certainty and harkye
when come you to take a game at bowls 
and this gossip is to serve instead any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck when
i think this i could go mad seize my hammer
and break and destroy all around me but
i will be calm and if this highland kite who
calls himself a falcon should stoop at my turtledove
he shall know whether a burgess perth
can draw a bow or not
it was now the thursday before the fated
palm sunday and the champions on either side
were expected to arrive the next day that they
might have the interval saturday to rest refresh
themselves and prepare for the combat
two or three each the contending parties
were detached to receive directions about the
encampment their little band and such other
instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering the field henry was not therefore
surprised at seeing a tall and powerful
i
highlander peering anxiously about the wynd
in which he lived in the manner in which the
natives a wild country examine the curiosities
 one that is more civilized the smith's
heart rose against the man on account his
country to which our perth burgher bore a natural
prejudice and more especially as he observed
the individual wear the plaid peculiar to
the clan quhele the sprig oakleaves worked
in silk intimated also that the individual
was one those personal guards young
eachin upon whose exertions in the future
battle so much reliance was placed
having observed so much henry withdrew
into his smithy for the sight the man raised
his passion and knowing that the highlander
came plighted to a solemn combat and could
not be the subject any inferior quarrel he
was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him in a few minutes however
the door the smithy flew open and fluttering
in his tartans which greatly magnified his
actual size the gael entered with the haughty
step a man conscious a personal dignity
superior to anything which he is likely to meet
with he stood looking around him and seemed
to expect to he received with courtesy and
regarded with wonder but henry had no sort
 inclination to indulge his vanity and kept
hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware 
his visitor's presence
you are the gow chrom f the bandjleg
get smith said the highlander 
those that wish to be crookbacked call me
so answered henry
no offence meant said the highlander 
but her own self comes to buy an armour
her own self's bare shanks may trot hence
with her answered henry i have none to
sell
if it was not within two days palm sunday
herself would make you sing another songs
retorted the gael
 and being the day it is said henry with
the same contemptuous indifference i pray
you to stand out my light
you are an uncivil person but her own
self is jr nan ord too and she knows the smith
is fiery when the iron is hot
 if her iiaiusell be hammermau herself
her nainsell may make her nain harness replied
henry
and so her nainsell would and never fash
you for the matter hut it is said gow chron
that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords
and varnishes that you work that have power
to make the blades cut steellinks as if they
were paper and the plate and mail turn back
steellances as if they were toddleprins 
they tell your ignorance any nonsense that
christian men refuse to believe said henry
i whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost
like an honest craftsman and commonly
it is the highlandman's och hone for 
 my hammer goes naturally to that
tune
friend it is but idle to spur a horse when
his legs are unshackled said the highlander
haughtily her own self cannot fight even
now and there is little gallantry in taunting her
thus
by nails and hammer you are right there
said the smith altering his tone but speak

oat at once friend what is it thou would'st have
 me i am in no humour for dallying
a hauberk for her chief eachin mac ian
said the highlander
you are a hamnierman you say are you
a judge this said our smith producing from
a chest the mail shirt on which he had been
lately employed
the gael handled it with a degree admiration
which had something envy in it he
looked curiously at every part its texture and
at length declared it the very best piece armour
that he had seen
a hundred cows and bullocks and a good
drift sheep would be e'en over cheap an offer
said the highlandman by way tentative
 but her nainsell will never bid thee less
come by them how she can
it is a fair proffer replied henry but
gold nor gear will never buy that harness i
want to try my own sword on my own armour 
and i will not give that mailcoat to any one
but who will face me for the best three blows
and a thrust in the fair field and it is your
chief's upon these terms

hut prut man take a drink and go to
bed said the highlander in great scorn are
ye mad think ye the captain the clan
quhele will be brawling and battling with a bit
perth burgess body like you whisht man
and hearken her nainsell will do ye mair credit
than ever belonged to your kin she will fight
you for the fair harness herself
she must first show that she is my match
said henry with a grim smile
how i one eachin's leichtach and
not your match 
you may try me if you will you say you
are a fir nan ord do you know how to cast a
sledgehammer 
ay truly ask the eagle if he can fly over
arragon
but before you strive with me you must
first try a cast with one mi leichtach here
dunter stand forth for the honour perth 
and now highlandman there stands a row 
hammers choose which you will and let us to
the garden
the highlander whose name was norman
nan ord or norman the hammer showed
his title to the epithet by selecting the largest
hammer the set at which henry smiled hunter
the stout journeyman the smith made
what was called a prodigious cast hut the highlander
making a desperate effort threw beyond
it by two or three feet and looked with an air
 triumph to henry who again smiled in reply
will you mend that said the gael offering
our smith the hammer
not with that child's toy said henry
which has scarce weight to fly against the
wind janniken fetch me sampson or one
 you help the boy for sampson is somewhat
ponderous
the hammer now produced was half as heavy
again as that which the highlander had selected
as one unusual weight norman stood astonished
 but he was still more so when henry
taking his position swung the ponderous implement
far behind his right haunch joint and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown
from a warlike engine the air groaned and
whistled as the mass flew through it down at
length it came and the iron head sunk a foot
into the earth a full yard beyond the cast 
norman
the highlander defeated and mortified went
to the spot where the weapon lay lifted it poised
it in his hand with great wonder and examined
it closely as if he expected to discover
more in it than a common hammer he at
length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile shrugging his shoulders and shaking
his head as the smith asked him whether
he would not mend his cast
 norman has lost too much at the sport already
he replied she has lost her own
name the hammered but does her oneself
the gow chron work at the anvil with that
horse's load iron 
you shall see brother said henry leading
the way to the smithy dunter he said
rax me that bar from the furnace and uplifting
sampson as he called the monstrous
hammer he plied the metal with a hundred
strokes from right to left now with the right
hand now with the left now with both with
so much strength at once and dexterity that he
worked off a small but beautifully proportioned
horseslide in half the time that an ordinary
smith would have taken for the same purpose
with a more manageable implement
 high high said the highlander and
what for would you be fighting with our young
chief who is far above your standard though
you were the best smith ever wrought with wind
and fire 
hark you said henry you seem a
good fellow and i'll tell you the truth your
master has wronged me and i give him this
harness freely for the chance fighting him
myself
nay if he hath wronged you he must meet
you said the lifeguardsman to do a man
wrong takes the eagle's feather out the chiefs
bonnet and were he the first in the highlands
and to be sure so is eachin he must fight the
man he has wronged or else a rose falls from
his chaplet
will you move him to this said henry
after the fight on sunday 
oh her nainsellwill do her best if the hawks
have not got her bones to pick for you must
know brother that clan chattan's claws pierce
rather deep
 the armour is your chief's on that condition
said henry but i will disgrace him
before king and court if he does not pay me
the price
deil a fear deil a fear i will bring him into
the barrack myself said norman assuredly

 you will do me a pleasure replied henry
and that you may remember your promise i
will bestow on you this dirk look if you hold
it truly and can strike between the mailhood
and the collar your enemy the surgeon will
be needless
the highlander was lavish in his expressions
 gratitude and took his leave
i have given him the best mail harness i
ever wrought said the smith to himself rather
repenting his liberality for the poor
chance that he will bring his chief into a fairfield
with me and then let catharine be his
who can win her fairly but much i dread the
youth will find some evasion unless he have
such luck on palm sunday as may induce him
to try another combat that is some hope however
 for i have often ere now seen a raw
young fellow shoot up after his first fight from
a dwarf into a giantqueller
thus with little hope but with the most determined
resolution henry smith awaited the
time that should decide his fate what made
him augur the worst was the silence both the
glover and his daughter they are ashamed
he said to confess the truth to me and therefore
they are silent
upon the friday at noon the two bands representing
the contending clans arrived at the
several points where they were to halt for refreshments

the clan quhele was entertained hospitably
at the rich abbey scone while the provost
regaled their rivals at his castle kinfauns 
the utmost care being taken to treat both parties
with the most punctilious attention and to
afford neither an opportunity complaining
 partiality all points etiquette were in
the meanwhile discussed and settled by the
lord high constable errol and the young
earl crawford the former acting on the
part the clan chattan and the latter patronising
the clan quhele messengers were passing
continually from the one earl to the other
and they held more than six meetings within
thirty hours before the ceremonial the field
could be exactly arranged
meanwhile in case revival ancient quarrel
many seeds which existed betwixt the
burghers and their mountain neighbours a proclamation
commanded the citizens not to approach
within half a mile the place where
the highlanders were quartered while on their
part the intended combatants were prohibited
from approaching perth without special license
troops were stationed to enforce this order
who did their charge so scrupulously as to prevent
simon glover himself burgess and citizen
 perth from approaching the town because
he owned having come thither at the same time
with the champions eachin maclan and wore
a plaid around him their check or pattern
this interruption prevented simon from seeking
out henry wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge all that had happened since
their separation which intercourse had it taken
place must have materially altered the catastrophe
 our narrative
on saturday afternoon another arrival took
place which interested the city almost as much
as the preparations for the expected combat
this was the approach the earl douglas who
rode through the town with a troop only thirty
horse but all whom were knights and gentlemen
 the first consequence men's eyes followed
this dreaded peer as they pursue the flight
 an eagle through the clouds unable to ken the
course the bird jove yet silent attentive
and as earnest in observing him as if they could
guess the object for which he sweeps through
the firmament he rode slowly through the
city and passed out at the northern gate he
next alighted at the dominican convent and
desired to see the duke albany the earl
was introduced instantly and received by the
duke with a manner which was meant to be
graceful and conciliatory but which could not
conceal both art and inquietude when the
first greetings were over the earl said with
great gravity i bring you melancholy news
vol iii s
your grace's royal nephew the duke rothsay
is no more and i fear hath perished by some
foul practices
 practices said the duke in confusion
 what practice who dared practise on the
heir the scottish throne 
 tis not for me to state how these doubts
arise said douglas but men say the eagle
was killed with an arrow fledged from his own
wing and the oak trunk rent by a wedge the
same wood fiiioactib
earl douglas said the duke albany
i am no reader riddles
nor am i a propounder them said douglas
haughtily your grace will find particulars
in these papers worthy perusal i
will go for half an hour to the cloister garden
and then rejoin you
you go not to the king my lord said
albany
no answered douglas i trust your
grace will agree with me that we should conceal
this great family misfortune from our sovereign
till the business tomorrow be decided
iiiifo
i willingly agree said albany if the
king heard this loss he could not witness
the combat and if he appear not in person
these men are likely to refuse to fight and the
whole work is cast loose but i pray you sit
down my lord while i read these melancholy
papers respecting poor rothsay
he passed the papers through his hands turning
some over with a hasty glance and dwelling
on others as if their contents had been the last
importance when he had spent nearly a quarter
 an hour in this manner he raised his eyes
and said very gravely my lord in these most
melancholy documents it is yet a comfort to see
nothing which can renew the divisions in the
king's councils which were settled by the last
solemn agreement between your lordship and
myself my unhappy nephew was by that agreement
to be set aside until time should send him
a graver judgment he is now removed by
fate and our purpose in that matter is anticipated
and rendered unnecessary
if your grace replied the earl sees nothing
to disturb the good understanding which
the tranquillity and safety scotland require
should exist between us i am not so ill a friend
 my country as to look closely for such
y a special friend and adviser met in the midst
 the lists having to assist them in determining
what was to be done the earl marshal the
lord high constable the earl crawford
and sir patrick charteris the chief the
clan chattan declared himself willing and desirous
 fighting upon the spot without regard
to the disparity numbers
that said torquil the oak clan
quhele will never consent to you can never
win honour from us with the sword and you
seek but a subterfuge that you may say when
you are defeated as you know you will be that
it was for want the number your band
fully counted out but i make a proposal 
vol iii t
ferqnhard day was the youngest your band
eachin maclan is the youngest ours we
will set him aside in place the man who has
fled from the combat
a most unjust and unequal proposal exclaimed
toshach beg the second as he might
be termed macgillie chattanaeh the life
 the chief is to the clan the breath our
nostrils nor will we ever consent that our chief
shall be exposed to dangers which the captain
 clan quliele does not share
torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan
was about to fail when the objection was made
to hector's being withdrawn from the battle 
and he was meditating how to support his proposal
when eachin himself interfered his
timidity it must be observed was not that
sordid and selfish nature which induces those
who are infected by it calmly to submit to dishonour
rather than risk clanger on the contrary
he was morally brave though constitutionally
timid and the shame avoiding the
combat became at the moment more powerful
than the fear facing it
i will not hear he said a scheme
which will leave my sword sheathed during
this day's glorious combat if i am yoking in
arms there are enough brave men around
me whom i may imitate if i cannot equal
he spoke these words in a spirit which imposed
on torqui and perhaps on the young
chief himself
now god bless his noble heart said the
fosterfather to himself i was sure the foul
spell would be broken through and that the
tardy spirit which besieged him would fly at
the sound the pipe and the first flutter 
the attach 
hear me lord marshal said the constable
 the hour combat may not be much
longer postponed for the day approaches to high
noon let the chief clan chattan take the
half hour which remains to find if he can a
substitute for this deserter if he cannot let
them fight as they stand
content i am said the marshal though
as none his own clan are nearer than fifty
miles i see not how macgillie cbattanach is to
find an auxiliary
that is his business said the high constable
 but if he offers a high reward there
are enough stout yeomen surrounding the
lists who will be glad enough to stretch their
limbs in such a game as is expected i myself
did my quality and charge permit would blithely
take a turn work amongst these wild fellows
and think it fame won
they communicated their decision to the
highlanders and the chief the clan chateau
replied you have judged impartially
and nobly my lords and i deem myself obliged
to follow your direction so make proclamation
heralds that if any one will take his
share with clan batten the honours and
chances this day he shall have present payment
 a gold crown and liberty to fight to
the death in nfy ranks
you are something chary your treasure
chief said the earl marshal a gold crown
is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you
 if there be any man willing to fight for
honour replied macgillie chattanach the
price will be enough and i want not the service
 a fellow who draws his sword for gold alone
the heralds had made their progress moving
half way round the lists stopping from time to
time to make proclamation as they had been
directed without the least apparent disposition
on the part any one to accept the proffered
enlistment some sneered at the poverty
 the highlanders who set so mean a price
upon such a desperate service others affected
resentment that they should esteem the bltod
 citizens so lightly none showed the slightest
intention to undertake the task proposed until
the sound the proclamation reached henry
 the wynd as he stood without the barrier
speaking from time to time with bailie craigdal
lie or rather listening vaguely to what the magistrate
was saying to him
 ha what proclaim they he cried out
a liberal offer on the part macgillie
chattanach said the host the griffin who
proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn
wild cat for the day and be killed a little in his
service that's all
how exclaimed the smith eagerly do
they make proclamation for a man to fight
against the clan quhele 
ay marry do they said griffin but i
think they will find no such fools in perth
he had hardly said th'te word when he beheld
the smith clear the barriers at a single bound
and alight in the lists saying here am i sir
herald henry the wynd willing to do battle
with the clan quhele
a cry admiration ran through the multitude
while the grave burghers not being able
to conceive the slightest reason for henry's behaviour
concluded that his head must be absolutely
turned with the love fighting the
provost was especially shocked
 thou art mad he said henry thou
hast neither twohanded sword nor shirt 
mail
truly no said henry for i parted with
a mailshirt which i had made for myself to
yonder gay chief the clan quhele who will
soon find on bis shoulders with what sort 
blows i clink my rivets as for twohanded
sword why this boy's brand will serve my turn
till i can master a heavier one
this must not be said errol hark
thee armourer by saint diary thou shalt have
my milan hauberk and good spanish sword
i thank your noble hardship sir gilbert
hay but the yoke with which your brave ancestor
turned the battle at loncarty would
serve my turn well enough i am little used to
sword or harness that i have not wrought myself
because i do not well know what blows
the one will bear out without being cracked
or the other lay on without snapping
the cry had in the meanwhile run through
the multitude and passed into the town that
the dauntless smith was about to fight without
armour when just as the fated hour was approaching
the shrill voice a female was heard
screaming for passage through the crowd the
multitude gave place to her importunity and
she advanced breathless with haste under the
burden a mail hauberk and a large twohanded
sword the widow oliver proudfate
was soon recognised and the arms which
bhe bore were those the smith himself which
occupied by her husband on the fatal evening
when he was murdered had been naturally
conveyed to his house with the dead body and
were now by the exertions his grateful widow
brought to the lists at a moment when
such proved weapons were the last consequence
to their owner henry joyfully received
the wellknown arms and the widow with trembling
haste assisted in putting them on and
then took leave him saying god for the
orphans champion and ill luck to all who
come before him 
confident at feeling himself in his wellproved
armour henry shook himself as if to settle
the steel shirt around him and unsheathing the
twohanded sword made it flourish over his
head cutting the air through which it whistled
in the form the figure eight with an ease
and sleight hand that proved how powerfully
and skilfully he could wield the ponderous
weapon the champions were now ordered to
march in their turns around the lists crossing
eo as to avoid meeting each other and making
obeisance as they passed the golden arbour
where the king was seated
while this course was performing most 
the spectators were again curiously comparing
the stature limbs and sinews the two parties
and endeavouring to form a conjecture as to
the probable issue the combat the feud 
a hundred years with all its acts aggression
and retaliation was concentrated in the bosom
 each combatant their countenances seemed
fiercely writhen into the wildest expression 
pride hate and a desperate purpose fighting
to the very last
the spectators murmured a joyful applause
in highwrought expectation the bloody game
wagers were offered and accepted both on the
general issue the conflict and on the feats 
particular champions the clear frank and elated
look henry smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators and odds to
use the modern expression were taken that he
would kill three his opponents before he himself
fell scarcely was the smith equipped for the
combat when the commands the chiefs ordered
the champions into their places and at the
same moment henry heard the voice simon
glover issuing from the crowd who were now
silent with expectation and calling on him
harry smith harry smith what madness
hath possessed thee 
ay he wishes to save his hopeful soninlaw
that is or is to be from the smith's handling
was henry's first thought his second
was to turn and speak with him and his third
that he could on no pretext desert the band
which he had joined or even seem desirous to
delay the fight consistently with honour
he turned himself therefore to the business
 the hour both parties were disposed by
the respective chiefs in three lines each containing
ten men they were arranged with such
intervals between each individual as offered him
scope to wield his sword the blade which was
five feet long not including the handle the second
and third lines were to come up as reserves
in case the first experienced disaster on the
right the array clan quhele the chief
eachin maclan placed himself in the second
line betwixt two his fosterbrothers four
 them occupied the right the first line
whilst the father and two others protected the
rear the beloved chieftain torquil in particular
kept close behind for the purpose covering
him thus eachin stood in the centre 
nine the strongest men his band having
four especial defenders in front one on each
hand and three in his rear
the line the clan chattan was arranged
in precisely the same order only that the chief
occupied the centre the middle rank instead
 being on the extreme right this induced
henry smith who saw in the opposing bands
only one enemy and that was the unhappy ea
chin to propose placing himself on the left 
the front rank the clan chattan but the
leader disapproved this arrangement and
having reminded henry that he owed him obedience
as having taken wages at his hand he
commanded him to occupy the space in the third
line immediately behind himself a post honour
cciuiiiily which henry could not decline
though he accepted it with reluctance
when the clans were thus drawn up opposed
to each other they intimated their feudal animosity
and their eagerness to engage by a wild
scream which uttered by the clan quhele was
answered and echoed back by the clan chattan
the whole at the same time shaking their swords
and menacing each other as if they meant to
conquer the imagination their opponents ere
they mingled in the actual strife
at this trying moment torquil who had
never feared for himself was agitated with
alarm on the part his dault yet consoled by
observing that he kept a determined posture 
and that the few words which he spoke to his
clan were delivered boldly and well calculated
to animate them to combat as expressing
his resolution to partake their fate in death or
victory but there was no time for further observation
the trumpets the king sounded a
charge the bagpipes blew up their screaming
and maddening notes and the combatants starting
forward in regular order and increasing

their pace till they came to a smart run met together
in the centre the ground as a furious
torrent encounters an advancing tide
for an instant or two the front lines hewing
at each other with their long swords seemed
engaged in a succession single combats 
but the second and third ranks soon came upon
either side actuated alike by the eagerness
 hatred and the thirst honour pressed
through the intervals and rendered the
scene a tumultuous chaos over which the huge
swords rose and sunk some still glittering
others streaming with blood appearing from
the wild rapidity with which they were swayed
rather to be put in motion by some complicated
machinery than to be wielded by human hands
some the combatants too much crowded
together to use those long weapons had already
betaken themselves to their poniards and endeavoured
to get within the swordsweep 
those opposed to them in the meantime blood
flowed fast and the groans those who fell began
to mingle with the cries those who fought 
for according to the manner the highlanders
at all times they could hardly be said to shout
but to yell those the spectators whose eyes
were best accustomed to such scenes blood
and confusion could nevertheless discover no
advantage yet acquired by either party the
conflict swayed indeed at different intervals
forwards or backwards butit was only in momentary
superiority which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding
exertion on the other side the wild notes
 the pipers were still heard above the tumult
and stimulated to farther exertions the fury 
the combatants
at once however and as if by mutual agreement
the instruments sounded a retreat it was
expressed in wailing notes which seemed to imply
a dirge for the fallen the two parties disengaged
themselves from each other to take
breath for a few minutes the eyes the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array 
the combatants as they drew off from the contest
but found it still impossible to decide which
had sustained the greater loss it seemed as if
the clan chattan had lost rather fewer men
than their antagonists but in compensation
the bloody plaids and shirts their party for
several on both sides had thrown their mantles
away showed more wounded men than the
clan qahele about twenty both sides lay
on the field dead or dying and arras and legs
lopped off heads cleft to the chine slashes deep
through the shoulder into the breast showed
at once the fury the combat the ghastly character
 the weapons used and the fatal strength
 the arms which wielded them the chief
 the clan chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage and was slightly
wounded eachin also had fought with spirit
surrounded by his bodyguard his sword
was bloody his bearing bold and warlike and
he smiled when old torquil folding him in his
arms loaded him with praises and with blessings

the two chiefs after allowing their followers
to breathe for the space about ten minutes
again drew up in their files diminished by nearly
one third llieir original number they
now chose their ground nearer to the river than
that on which they had formerly encountered
which was encumbered with the wounded
and the slain some the former were observed
from time to time to raise themselves to
gain a glimpse the field and sink back most
 them to die from the effusion blood which
poured from terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore

harry smith was easily distinguished by his
lowland habit as well as his remaining on the
spot where they had first encountered where he
stood leaning on his sword beside a corpse
whose bonneted head carried to ten yards distance
from the body by the force the blow
which had swept it off exhibited the oak leaf
the appropriate ornament the bodyguard 
eachin maclan since he slew this man henry
had not struck a blow but had contented
himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself and some which were aimed at the
chief macgillie chattanach became alarmed
when having given the signal that his men
should again draw together he observed that
his powerful recruit remained at a distance from
the ranks and showed little disposition to join
them
 what ails thee man said the chief
can so strong a body have a mean and cowardly
spirit come and make in to the combat

you as good as called me hireling but now
replied henry if i am such pointing to
the headless corpse i have done enough for
my day's wage
 he that serves me without counting his
hours replied the chief i reward him without
reckoning wages
 then said the smith i fight as a volunteer
and in the post which best likes me
 all that is at your own discretion replied
macgillie chattanach who saw the prudence
 humouring an auxiliary such promise
it is enough said henry and shouldering
his heavy weapon he joined the rest the
combatants with alacrity and placed himself
opposite to the chief the clan quhele
vol in u
it was then for the first time that eachin
showed some uncertainty he had long looked
up to henry as the best combatant which perth
and its neighbourhood could bring into the lists
his hatred to him as a rival was mingled with
recollection the ease with which he had once
though unarmed foiled his own sudden and
desperate attack and when he beheld him with
his eyes fixed in his direction the dripping
sword in his hand and obviously meditating
an attack on him individually his courage fell
and he gave symptoms wavering which did
not escape his fosterfather
it was lucky for eachin that torquil was
incapable from the formation his own temper
and that those with whom he had lived
to conceive the idea one his own tribe much
less his chief and fosterson being deficient
in animal courage could he have imagined
this his grief and rage might have driven him
to the fierce extremity taking eachin's life
to save him from staining his honour but
his mind rejected the idea that hisdault was a
personal coward as something which was monstrous
and unnatural that he was under the
influence enchantment was a solution which
superstition had suggested and he now anxiously
but in a whisper demanded hector does
the spell now darken thy spirit eachin 
yes wretch that i am answered the ua
happy youth and yonder stands the fell enchanter

 what exclaimed torquil and you
wear harness his making norman miserable
boy why brought you that accursed
mail 
if my arrow has flown astray i can but
shoot my life after it answered 
 stand firm you shall see me break
the spell
yes stand firm said torquil he maybe
a fell enchanter but my own ear has heard
and my own tongue has told that eachin shall
leave the battle whole free and un wounded 
let us see the saxon wizard who can gainsay
that he may be a strong man but the fair
forest the oak shall fall stock and bough
ere he lay a finger on my dault ring around
him mv sons bas air son eachin 
sos
the sons torquil shouted back the words
which signify death for hector 
encouraged by their devotion eachin renewed
his spirit and called boldly to the minstrels
 his clan said snas that is strike up
the wild pibroch again sounded the onset 
but the two parties approached each other more
slowly than at first as men who knew and respected
each other's valour henry wynd in
bis impatience to begin the contest advanced
before the clan chattan and signed to eachin
to come on norman however sprang forward
to cover his fosterbrother and there was
a general though momentary pause as if both
parties were willing to obtain an omen the
fate the day from the event this duel
the highlander advanced with his large sword
uplifted as in act to strike but just as he
came within sword's length he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon leapt lightly over the
smith's sword as he fetched a cut at him drev
his dagger and being thus within henry's guard
struck him with the weapon his own gift on
the side the throat directing the blow downwards
into the chest and calling aloud at the
same time you taught me the stab 
but henry wynd wore his own good hauberk
doubly defended with a lining tempered
steel had he been less surely armed his combats
had been ended for ever even as it was
he was slightly wounded
fool he replied striking norman a blow
with the pommel his long sword which
made him stagger backwards you were
taught the thrust but not the parry and fetching
a blow at his antagonist which cleft his
skull through the steelcap he strode over the
lifeless body to engage the young chief who
now stood open before him
but the sonorous voice torquil thundered
out far veil air son eachin another for
hector and the two brethren vho flanked
their chief on each side thrust forward upon
henry and striking both at once compelled
him to keep the defensive
 ff forward race the tiger cat cried
macgillie chattanach save the brave saxon 
let these kites feel your talons 
already much wounded the chief dragged
himself up to the smith's assistance and cut
down one the leichtachy by whom he was assailed
henry's own good sword rid him 
the other
rest air son eachin again for hector
shouted the faithful fosterfather
bas air soi eachin p death for hector
answered two more his devoted sons and
opposed themselves to the fury the smith
and those who had come to his aid while eachin
moving towards the left wing the battle
sought less formidable adversaries and again
by some show valour revived the sinking
hopes his followers the two children the
oak who had covered this movement shared
the fate their brethren for the cry the clan
chattan chief had drawn to that part the field
some his bravest warriors the sons torquit
did not fall unavenged but left dreadful
marks their swords on the persons the
dead and living but the necessity keeping
their most distinguished soldiers around the person
 their chief told to disadvantage on the
w
ieoeial event the combat ami so few were
uow the number who remained lighting that it
was easy to see that the clan chattan hard fifteen
 their number left though most them
wounded and that the clan quhele only
about ten remained whom there were four 
the chiefs bodyguard including torquil himself

they fought and struggled on however and
as their strength decayed their fury seemed to
increase henry wynd now wounded in many
places was still bent on breaking through or
exterminating the band bold hearts who continued
to fight around the object his animosity
but still the father's shout another
for hector was cheerfully answered by the
fatal countersign death for hector and
though the clan quhele were now outnumbered
the combat seemed still dubious it was
bodily lassitude alone that again compelled
them to another pause
the clan chattan were then observed to be
twelve in number but two or three were scarce
able tp stand without leaning on their swords
n
five were left the clan quhele torquil and
his youngest son were the number both slightly
wounded eachin alone had from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against
his person escaped without injury the rage
 both parties had sunk through exhaustion
into sullen desperation they walked staggering
as if in their sleep through the carcasses
 the slain and gazed on them as if again to
animate their hatred towards their sursaving
enemies by viewing the friends they had lost
the multitude soon after beheld the survivors
 the desperate conflict drawing together to
renew the exterminating feud on the banks 
the river as the spot least slippery with blood
and less encumbered with the bodies the
slain
for god's sake for the sake the mercy
which we daily pray for said the kindhearted
old king to the duke albany let this be
ended wherefore should these wretched rags
and remnants humanity be suffered to complete
their butchery surely they will now be
ruled and accept peace on moderate terms 
compose yourself my liege said his brother
 these men are the pest the lowlands
both chiefs are still living if they go
back unharmed the whole day's work is castaway
remember your promise to the council
that you would not cry hold
iyou compel me to a great crime albany
both as a king who should protect his subjects
and as a christian man who respects the brother
 his faith
 you judge wrong my lord said the duke 
these are not loving subjects but disobedient
rebels as my lord crawford can bear witness
 and they are still less christian men for
the prior the dominicans will vouch for me
that they are more than half heathen
the king sighed deeply you must work
your pleasure and are too wise for me to contend
with i can but turn away and shut my eyes
from the sights and sounds a carnage which
makes me sicken but well i know that god
will punish me even for witnessing this waste
 human life

i would to heaven my royal brother said
albany with a voice half choked that the
bloody field we have seen were the worst we had
to see or hear this day i should waste little
sorrow on the wild kerne who lie piled on it
like carrion but he paused
 how exclaimed the king in terror 
what new evil rothsay it must be it is
rothsay speak out what new folly has
been done what fresh mischance 
my lord my liege folly and mischance
are now ended with my hapless nephew
 he is dead he is dead screamed the
agonized parent albany as thy brother i
conjure thee but no i am thy brother no
longer as thy king dark and subtle man i
charge thee to tell the worst 
albany faltered out the details are but
imperfectly known to me but the certainty is
that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his
apartment last night from sudden illness as i
have heard 
o rothsay o my beloved robert 
would to god i had died for thee my son my
son
so spoke in the emphatic words scripture
the helpless and bereft father tearing his greybeard
and hoary hair while albany speechless
and consciencestruck did not venture to interrupt
the tempest his grief but the agony 
the king's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fmyj a mood so contrary to the gentleness and
timidity his nature that the remorse albany
was drowned in his fear
and this is the said the king 
thy moral saws irreligious punishments but
the besotted father who gave the son into thy
hands who gave the innocent lamb to the
butcher is a king and thou shalt know it to
thy cost shall the murderer stand in presence
 his brother stained with the blood that
brother's son no what ho without there 
maclouis brandanes treachery 
murder take arms if you love the stewart 
maclouis with several the guards rushed
into the apartment
murder and treason exclaimed the miserable
king brandanes your noble prince 
here his grief and agitation interrupted for a
moment the fatal information it was his object
to convey at length he resumed his broken
speech an axe and a block instantly into the
courtyard arrest the word choked his
utterance
arrest whom my noble liege said maclouis
who observing the king influenced by
a tide passion so different from the gentleness
 his ordinary demeanour almost conjectured
that his brain had been disturbed by
the unusual horrors the combat he had witnessed
 whom shall i arrest my liege he
replied here is none but your grace's royal
brother albany 
most true said the king his brief fit 
vindictive passion soon dying away most
true none but albany none but my parents
child none but my brother o god enable me
to quell the sinful passion which glows in this
bosom sancta marian ora pro nobis 
maclouis cast a look wonder towards the
duke albany who endeavoured to hide his
confusion under an affectation deep sympathy
and muttered to the officer 
the great misfortune has been too much
for his understanding
what misfortune please your grace replied
maclouis i have heard none
how not heard the death my nephew
rothsay 
the duke rothsay dead my lord 
albany exclaimed the faithful braudauewith
the utmost horror and astonishment when
how and where fnq floi iio ho sfuog
two days since the manner as yet unknown
 at falkland
maclouis gazed at the duke for an instant 
then with a kindling eye and determined look
said to the king who seemed deeply engaged in
his mental devotion my liege a minute or
two since you left a word one word unspoken
let it pass yyir lips and your pleasure
is law to your brandanes 
 i was praying against temptation maclouis
said the heartbroken king and you
bring it to me would you arm a madman with
a drawn weapon but oh albany my friend
my brother my bosom counsellor how how
comest thou by the heart to do this 
albany seeing that the king's mood was
softening replied with more firmness than before
 my castle is no barrier against the
power death i have n and why unfortunate i pray you exclaimed
the youth if i am coward and villain have
not villainy and cowardice command over the
elements have i not braved the water without
its choking me and trod the firm earth without
its opening to devour me and shall a
mortal oppose my purpose 
 he raves alas said catharine haste
to call some help he will not harm me but
i fear he will do evil to himself see how he
stares down on the roaring waterfall i
the gleewoman hastened to do as she was
ordered and conachar's halffrenzied spirit
seemed relieved by her absence catharine
he said now she is gone i will say i know
thee i know thy love peace and hatred 
war but hearken i have rather than strike
a blow at my enemy given up all that a man
s
calls dearest i have lost honour fame and
friends and such friends he placed his hands
before this face oh their love surpassed the
love woman why should i hide my tears 
all know my shame all should see my sorrow
yes all might see but who would pity
it catharine as i ran like a madman down
the strath man and woman called shame on
me the beggar to whom i flung an alms that
i might purchase one blessing threw it back in
disgust and with a curse upon the coward 
each bell that tolled rung out shame on the recreant
caitiff the brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating the wild winds in their rustling
and howling the hoarse waters in their dash
and roar cried out upon the dastard the
faithful nine are still pursuing me they cry
with feeble voice strike but one blow in our
revenge we all died for you 
while the unhappy youth thus raved a rustling
was heard in the bushes there is but one
way he exclaimed springing upon the parapet
but with a terrified glance towards the thicket
through which one or two attendants were stealing
with the purpose surprising him but
the instant he saw a human form emerge from
the cover the thicket he waved his hands
wildly over his head and shrieking out bas
air eachin plunged down the precipice into
the raging cataract beneath
it is needless to say that aught save thistledown
must have been dashed to pieces in such
a fall but the river was swelled and the remains
 the unhappy youth were never seen
a varying tradition has assigned more than one
supplement to the history it is said by one
account that the young captain clan quhele
swam safe to shore far below the linnsof carats
 and that wandering disconsolately in the
deserts ranch he met with father clement
who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit on the principle the old
culdees he converted it is said the heartbroken
and penitent conachar who lived with
him in his cell sharing his devotion and privations
till death removed them in succession
another wilder legend supposes that he was
snatched from death by the daioneshieyoviiayy
folk aud that he continues to wander throws
wood and wild arrived like an ancient highlander
but carrying his sword in his left hand the
phantom appears always in deep grief sometimes
he seems about to attack the traveller
but when resisted with courage always flies
these legends are founded on two peculiar
points in his story his evincing timidity and
his committing suicide both them circumstances
unexampled in the history a mountain
chief
when simon glover having seen his friend
henry duly taken care in his own house in
curfew street arrived that evening at the
place campsieie he found his daughter extremely
ill a fever in consequence the
scenes to which she had lately been a witness
and particularly the catastrophe her late playmate
the affection the gleemaiden rendered
her so attentive and careful a nurse that
the glover said it should not be his fault if she
ever touched lute again save for her own amusement

it was some time ere simon ventured to tell
hi daughter henrys late exploits and his
severe wounds and he took care to make the
most the encouraging circumstance that her
faithful lover had refused both honour and
wealth rather than become a professed soldier
and follow the douglas catharine sighed
deeply and shook her head at the history 
bloody palm sunday on the north inch but
apparently she had reflected that men rarely
advance in civilization or refinement beyond
the ideas their own age and that a headlong
and exuberant courage like that henry
smith was in the iron days in which they lived
preferable to the deficiency which had led to
conachar's catastrophe if she had any doubts
on the subject they were removed in due time
by henry's protestations so soon as restored
health enabled him to plead his own cause
i should blush to say catharine that i
am even sick the thoughts doing battle
yonder last field showed carnage enough to
glut a tiger i am therefore resolved to hang
up my broad sword never to be drawn more
unless against the enemies scotland
 and should scotland call for it said catharine
 i will buckle it round you
and catharine said the joyful glover
we will pay largely for soul masses for those
who have fallen by henry's sword and that
will not only cure spiritual flaws but make us
friends with the church again
for that purpose father said catharine
the hoards the wretched d wining may be
applied he bequeathed them to me but i think
you would not mix his base bloodmoney with
your honest gains 
i would bring the plague into ray house as
soon said the resolute glover
the treasures the wicked apothecary were
distributed accordingly among the four monasteries
 nor was there ever after a breath suspicion
concerning the orthodoxy old simon
or his daughter
henry and catharine were married within
four months after the battle the north inch

i admit that my retrenchments have been
numerous and leave gaps in the story
which in your original manuscript would
have run well nigh to a fourth volume as
my printer assures me i am sensible besides
that in consequence the liberty 
curtailment you have allowed m e some parts
 the story have been huddled up without
the necessary details but after all it is
better that the travellers should have to step
over a drain than to wade through a morass
 that the reader should have to suppose
what may easily be inferred than be
obliged to creep through pages dull explanation
i have struck out for example
the whole machinery the white lady
and the poetry by which it is so ably supported
in the original manuscript but
you must allow that the public taste gives
little encouragement to those legendary superstitions
which formed the delight alternately
and the terror our predecessors
in like manner much is omitted illustrative
 the impulse enthusiasm in favour
introductory epistle ill
 the ancient religion in mother magdalen
and the abbot but we do not feel deep
sympathy at this period with what was
once the most powerful and animating principle
in europe with the exception that
 the reformation by which it was successfully
opposed
you rightly observe that these retrenchments
have rendered the title no longer applicable
to the subject and that some other
would have been more suitable to the work
in its present state than that the abbot
who made so much greater figure in the
original and for whom your friend the benedictine
seems to have inspired you with
a sympathetic respect i must plead guilty
to this accusation observing at the same
time in manner extenuation that though
the objection might have been easily removed
by giving a new title to the work
yet in doing so i should have destroyed
the necessary cohesion between the present
history and its predecessor the ivio
mastery which i was unwilling to do as
 introductory epistle
the period and several the personages
were the same
after all my good friend it is little
consequence what the work is called or on
what interest it tmns providing it catches
the public attention for the quality the
wine could we but ensure it may according
to the old proverb render the bush unnecessary
or little consequence

x he time which passes over our heads so
imperceptibly makes the same gradual
change in habits manners and character
as in personal appearance at the revolution
 every five years we find ourselves
another and yet the same there is a
change views and no less the light in
 the abbot
which we regard them a change motives
as well as actions nearly twice that
space had glided away over the head 
halbert glendinning and his lady betwixt
the conclusion that narrative in which
they played a distinguished part and the
commencement the present
two circumstances only had embittered
their union which was otherwise as happy
as mutual affection could render it the
first these was indeed the common calamity
 scotland being the distracted state
 that unhappy country where every man's
sword was directed against his neighbour's
bosom glendinning had proved what murray
expected him a steady friend strong
in battle and wise in counsel adhering to
him from motives gratitude in situations
where by his own unblessed will he would
either have stood neuter or have joined
the opposite party hence when danger
was near and it was seldom far distant sir
halbert glendinning for he now bore the
rank knighthood was perpetually sumthe
abbot 
money to attend his patron on distant expeditions
or on perilous enterprizes or to
assist him with his counsel in the doubtful
intrigues a half barbarous court he was
thus frequently and for a long space absent
from his castle and from his lady and to
this ground regret we must add that
their union had produced no children to
occupy the attention the lady 
while she was thus deprived her
husband's domestic society
on such occasions she lived almost entirely
secluded from the world within the
walls her paternal mansion visiting
amongst neighbours was a matter entirely
out the question unless on occasion 
solemn festival and then it was chiefly
confined to near kindred these the
lady avenel had none who survived
and the dames the neighbouring barons
affected to regard her less as the heiress 
the house avenel than as the wife a
peasant the son a churchvassal raised
 the abbot
up to mushroom eminence by the capricious
favour murray
this pride ancestry which rankled in
the bosom the more ancient gentry was
more openly expressed by their ladies and
was moreover embittered not a little by
the political feuds the time for most 
the southron chiefs were friends to the authority
 the queen and very jealous 
the power murray the castle 
was therefore on all these accounts as
melancholy and solitary a residence for its
lady as could well be imagined still it
had the essential recommendation great
security the reader knows that the fortress
was built upon an islet in a small
lake and was only accessible by a causeway
intersected by a double ditch defended
by two drawbridges so that without artillery
it might in these days be considered
as impregnable it was only necessary
therefore to secure against surprise and
the service six able men within the casthe
abbot 
tie was sufficient for that purpose if
more serious danger threatened an ample
garrison was supplied by the male inhabitants
 a little hamlet which under the
auspices halbert glendinning had arisen
on a small piece level ground betwixt
the lake and the hill nearly adjoining
to the spot where the causeway joined the
mainland the lord avenel had found
it an easy matter to get inhabitants as he
was not only a kind and beneficent overlord
but well qualified both by his experience
in armes his high character for wisdom
and integrity and his favour with the powerful
earl murray to protect and defend
those who dwelt under his banner in leaving
his castle for any length time he
had therefore the consolation to reflect
that this village afforded on the slightest
notice a band thirty stout men which
was more than sufficient for its defence 
while the families the villagers as was
usual on such occasions fled to the recesses
 the mountains drove their cattle to the
 the abbot
same places shelter and left the enemy
to work their will on their miserable cottages

one guest only resided generally if not
constantly at the castle avenel this
was henry warden who now felt himself
less able to the stormy task imposed on the
reforming clergy and having by his zeal
given personal offence to many the leading
nobles and chiefs did not consider himself
as perfectly safe unless when within
the walls the strong mansion some assured
friend he ceased not however to
serve his cause as eagerly with his pen ashe
had formerly done with his tongue and
had engaged in a furious and acrimonious
contest concerning the sacrifice the
mass as it was termed with the abbot
eustatius formerly the subprior 
answers replies duchies trophies
quadruple followed thick upon each
other and displayed as is not unusual in
controversy fully as much zeal as christian
charity the disputation very soon bethe
abbot 
came as celebrated as that john knox
and the abbot corseraguel raged nearly
as fiercely and fraught i know the pieces
to which it gave rise may be as precious in
the eyes bibliographers but the engrossing
nature his occupation rendered
the theologian not the most interesting
companion for a solitary female and his
grave stern and absorbed deportment
which seldom shewed any interest except
in that which concerned his religious profession
made his presence rather add to
than diminish the gloom which hung over
the castle avenel to superintend the
tasks her numerous female domestics
was the principal part the lady's daily
employment her spindle and distaff her
bible and a solitary walk upon the battlements
 the castle or upon the causeway
or occasionally but more seldom upon the
banks the little lake consumed the rest
 th day but so great was the insecurity
 the period that when she ventured
a 
 the abbot
to extend her walk beyond the hamlet the
warder on the watchtower was directed to
keep a sharp outlook in every direction
and four or five men held themselves in
readiness to mount and sally forth from
the village at the slightest appearance 
alarm
thus stood affairs at the castle when
after an absence several weeks the
knight avenel which was now the title
most frequently given to sir halbert glendining
was daily expected to return home
day after day however passed away and
he returned not letters in those days were
rarely written and the knight must have
resorted to a secretary to express his intentions
in that manner besides intercourse
 all kinds was precarious and unsafe and
no man cared to give any public intimation
 the time and direction a journey since
it was always likely he might in that case
meet with more enemies than friends upon
the road the precise day therefore 
the abbot 
sir halbert's return was not fixed but that
which his lady's fond expectation had calculated
upon in her own mind was long
since passed and hope delayed began to
make the heart sick
it was upon the evening a sultry summer's
day when the sun was half sunk behind
the distant western mountains lauderdale
that the lady took her solitary
walk on the battlements a range 
buildings which formed the front the
castle where a flat roof flagstones presented
a broad and convenient promenade
the level surface the lake undisturbed
except by the occasional dipping a tealduck
or coot was gilded with the beams
 the setting luminary and reflected as if
in a golden mirror the hills amongst which
it lay embosomed the scene otherwise
so lonely was occasionally enlivened by
the voices the children in the village
which softened by distance reached the
ear the lady in her solitary walk or by
the distant call the herdsman as he
 the abbot
guided his cattle from the glen in which
they had pastured all day to place them
in greater security for the night in the
immediate vicinity the village the
deep lowing the cows seemed to demand
the attendance the milkmaidens
who singing shrilly and merrily strolled
forth each with her pail on her head to attend
to the duty the evening the lady
 avenel looked and listened the sounds
which she heard reminded her former
days when her most important employment
as well as her greatest delight was
to assist dame glendinning and tibi racket
in milking the cows at glendearg the
thought was fraught with melancholy
c why was i not she said the peasant
girl which in all men's eyes i seemed
to be halbert and i had then spent our
life peacefully in his native glen undisturbed
by the phantoms either fear or
 ambition his greatest pride had then
been to shew the fairest herd in the hali
dome his greatest danger to repel some
the abbot 
pilfering snatcher from the border and
the utmost distance which would have divided
us would have been the chase 
some outlying deer but alas what avails
the blood which halbert has shed and the
dangers which he encounters to support a
name and rank dear to him because he has
it from me but which we shall never transmit
to our posterity with me the name
 avenel must expire
she sighed as these reflections arose and
looking towards the shore the lake her
eye was attracted by a groupe children
 various ages assembled to see a little
ship constructed by some village artist perform
its first voyage on the water it was
launched amid the shouts tiny voices and
the clapping little hands and shot bravely
forth on its voyage with a favouring
wind which promised to carry it to the
other side the lake some the bigger
boys ran round to receive and secure it on
the farther shore trying their speed against
each other as they sprang like young fawns
j
 the abbot
along the shingly verge the lake the
rest for whom such a journey seemed too
arduous remained watching the motions 
the fairy vessel from the spot where it had
been launched the sight their sports
pressed on the mind the childless lady
 avenel
 why are none these prattlers mine 
she continued pursuing the tenor her
melancholy reflections their parents can
scarce find them in the coarsest food and
i who could nurse them in plenty i am
doomed never to hear a child call me mother

the thought sunk on her heart with a
bitterness which resembled envy so deeply
is the desire offspring implanted in the
female breast she pressed her hands together
as if she was wringing them in the
extremity her desolate feeling as one
whom heaven had written childless a
large staghound the greyhound species
approached at this moment and attracted
perhaps by the gesture licked her hands
the abbot 
and pressed his large head against them
he obtained the desired caress in return
but still the sad impression remained
wolf she said as if the animal could
have understood her complaints thou art
a noble and beautiful animal but alas i the
love and affection that i long to bestow is
 a quality higher than can fall to thy
share though i love thee much
and as if she were apologizing to wolf
for withholding from him any part her
regard she caressed his proud head and
crest while looking in her eyes he seemed
to ask her what she wanted or what he
could do to shew his attachment at this
moment a shriek distress was heard on
the shore from the playful groupe which
had been lately so jovial the lady looked
and saw the cause with great agony
the little ship the object the children's
delighted attention had stuck among
some tufts the plant which bears the laterally
that marked a little shoal in the
lake about an arrowflight from the shore
 the abbot
a hardy little boy who had taken the
lead in the race round the margin the
lake did not hesitate a moment to strip off
his wyliecoats plunge into the water and
swim towards the object their common
solicitude the first movement the lady
was to call for help but she observed that
the boy swam strongly and fearlessly and
as she saw that one or two villagers who
were distant spectators the incident
seemed to give themselves no uneasiness
on his account she supposed that he was
accustomed to the exercise and that there
was no danger but whether in swimming
the boy had struck his breast against a
sunken rock or whether he was suddenly
taken with the cramp or whether he had
overcalculated his own strength it so happened
that when he had disembarrassed
the little plaything from the flags in which
it was entangled and sent it forward on its
course he had scarce swam a few yards in
his way to the shore than he raised himself
suddenly from the water and screamed
the abbot 
aloud clapping his hands at the same time
with an expression fear and pain
the lady avenel instantly taking
the alarm called hastily to the attendants
to get the boat ready but this was an
affair some time the only boat permitted
to be used on the lake was moored
within the second cut which intersected the
canal and it was several minutes ere it could
be unmoored and got under way meantime
the lady avenel with agonizing
anxiety saw that the efforts which the poor
boy made to keep himself afloat were now
exchanged for a faint struggling which
would soon have been over but for aid
equally prompt and unhoped for wolf
who like some that large species 
a practised waterdog had marked
the object her anxiety and quitting
his mistress's side had sought the nearest
point from which he could with safety plunge
into the lake with the wonderful instinct
which these noble animals have so often displayed
in the like circumstances he swam
straight to the spot where his assistance was
 the abbot
so much wanted and seizing the child's 
in his mouth he not only kept him
afloat but towed him towards the causeway
the boat having put off with a couple
 men met the dog halfway and relieved
him his burthen they landed on the
causeway close by the entrance to the castle
with their yet lifeless burthen and were
met at the entrance the gate by the lady
 avenel attended by one or two her
maidens eagerly waiting to administer assistance
to the sufferer
he was borne into the castle deposited
upon a bed and every mode recovery resorted
to which the knowledge the times
and the skill henry warden who professed
some medical knowledge could dictate
for some time it was all in vain
and the lady watched with unspeakable
earnestness the pallid countenance the
beautiful child he seemed about ten years
old his dress was the meanest sort but
his long curled hair and the noble cast 
his features partook not that poverty
the abbor 
 appearance the proudest noble in scotland
might have been yet prouder could he
have called that child his heir while with
breathless anxiety the lady avenel gazed
on his wellformed and expressive features
a slight shade colour returned gradually
to the cheek suspended animation
became restored by degrees the child sighdeeply
opened his eyes which to the human
countenance produces the effect 
light upon the natural landscape stretched
his arms towards the lady and muttered
the word mother that epithet all
others which is dearest to the female ear
god madam said the preacher has
restored the child to your wishes it must
be yours so to bring him up that he may
not one day wish that he had perished in his
innocence
it shall be my charge said the lady 
and again throwing her arms around the
boy she overwhelmed him with kisses and
caresses so much was she agitated by the
terror arising from the danger in which he
 the abbot
had been just placed and by joy at his unexpected
deliverance
 eut you are not my mother said the
boy collecting his recollection and endeavouring
though faintly to escape from the
caresses the lady avenel you are
not my mother alas i have no mother 
only i have dreamt that i had one
i will read the dream for you my love
answered the lady avenel j and i will
be myself your mother surely god has
heard my wishes and in his own marvellous
manner hath sent me an object on which
my affections may expand themselves she
looked towards warden as she spoke the
preacher hesitated what he should reply
to a burst passionate feeling which perhaps
seemed to him more enthusiastic than
the occasion demanded in the meanwhile
the large staghound wolf which dropping
wet as he was had followed his mistress
into the apartment and had sate by
the bedside a patient and quiet spectator
 all the means used for resuscitation 
the abbot 
the being whom he had preserved now became
impatient remaining any longer
unnoticed and began to whine and fawn
upon the lady with his great rough paws
 yes she said good wolf and you
shall be remembered also for your day's
work and i will think the more you for
having preserved the life a creature so
beautiful
but wolf was not quite satisfied with the
share attention which he thus attracted 
he persisted in whining and pawing upon
his mistress his caresses being rendered still
more troublesome by his long shaggy hair
being so much and thoroughly wetted till
she desired one the domestics with whom
he was familiar to call the animal out the
apartment wolf resisted every invitation
to this purpose until his mistress positively
commanded him to begone in an angry
tone whenturningtowardsthebedon which
the boy still lay half awake to sensation
half drowned in the meanders a fluctuating
delirium he uttered a deep and savage
 the abbot
growl curled up his nose and lips shewing
his full range white and sharpened teeth
which might have matched those an actual
wolf and then turning round sullenly
followed the domestic out the apartment

sit is singular said the lady addressing
warden the animal is not only so goodnatured
to all but so particularly fond 
children what can ail him at the little fellow
whose life he has saved 
dogs replied the preacher are but
too like the human race in their foibles
though their instinct be less erring than the
reason poor mortal man when relying
upon his own unassisted powers jealousy
my good lady is a passion not unknown to
them and they often evince it not only
with respect to the preferences which they
see given by their masters to individuals 
their own species but even when their rivals
are children you have caressed that
child much and eagerly and the dog considers
himself as a discarded favourite
the abbot 
it is a strange instinct j said the lady
 and from the gravity with which you
mention it my reverend friend i would
almost say that you supposed this singular
jealousy my favourite wolf was not only
wellfounded but justifiable but perhaps
you speak in jest
 i seldom jest answered the preacher
 life was not lent to us to be expended in
that idle mirth which resembles the crackling
 thorns under the pot i would only
have you derive if it so please you this
lesson from what i have said that the best
 our feelings when indulged to excess
may give pain to others there is but one
in which we may indulge to the utmost
limit vehemence which our bosom is
capable secure that excess cannot exist
in the greatest intensity to which it can be
excited i mean the love our maker
 surely said the lady avenel weare
commanded by the same authority to
love our neighbour 
 the abbot
 ay madam said warden but our
love to god is to be unbounded we are to
love him with our whole heart our whole
soul and our whole strength the love
which the precept commands us to bear to
our neighbour has affixed to it a direct limit
and qualification we are to love our
neighbour as ourself as it is elsewhere explained
by the great commandment that
we do unto him as we would that he did
unto us here there is a limit and a bound
even to the most praiseworthy our affections
so far as they are turned upon
sublunary and terrestrial objects we are
to render to our neighbour whatever be
his rank or degree that corresponding portion
 affection with which we could rationally
expect we should ourselves be regarded
by those standing in the same degree
 relation to us hence neither
husband nor wife neither son nor daughter
neither friend nor relation are lawfully to
be made the objects our idolatry the
the abbot 
lord our god is a jealous god and will
not endure that we bestow on the creature
that extremity devotion which he who
made us demands as his own share i say
to you lady that even in the fairest and
purest and most honourable feelings our
nature there is that original taint sin
which ought to make us pause and hesitate
ere we indulge them to excess 
i understand not this reverend sir
said the lady nor do i guess what i can
have now said or done to draw down on
me an admonition which has something a
taste reproof
lady said warden i crave your
pardon if i have urged aught beyond the
limits my duty but consider whether
in the sacred promise to be not only a protectress
but a mother to this poor child
your purpose may meet the wishes the
noble knight your husband the fondness
which you have lavished on the unfortunate
and i own most lovely child
vol i b
 the abbot
has met something like a reproof in the
bearing your household dog displease
not your noble husband men as well as
animals are jealous the affections those
they love
this is too much reverend sir said
theladyof avenel greatly offended you
have been long our guest and have received
from the knight avenel and myself
that honour and regard which your character
and profession so justly demand
eut i am yet to learn that i have at anytime
authorized your interference in our
family arrangements or placed you as a
judge our conduct towards each other
i pray this may be forborne in future
 lady replied the preacher with the
boldness peculiar to the clergy his persuasion
at that time when you weary 
my admonitions when i see that my services
are no longer acceptable to you and
the noble knight your husband i shall
know that my master wills me no longer
to abide here j and praying for a continuthe
abbot 
ance his best blessings on your family i
will then were the season the depth 
winter and the hour midnight walk out on
yonder waste and travel forth through these
waste mountains as lonely and unaided
though far more helpless than when first
met your husband in the valley glendear
but while i remain here i will not
see you err from the true path no not an
hair'sbreadth without making the old man's
voice and remonstrance heard
 nay but said the lady who both
loved and respected the good man though
sometimes a little offended at what she
conceived to be an exuberant degree 
zeal we will not part this way my good
friend women are quick and hasty in
their feelings but believe me my wishes
and my purposes towards this child are
such as both my husband and you will approve
 the clergyman bowed and retreated
to his own apartment

when warden had left the apartment the
lady avenel gave way to the feelings 
tenderness which the sight the boy his
sudden danger and his recent escape had
inspired and no longer awed by the sternness
as she deemed it the preacher heaped
with caresses the lovely and interesting
child he was now in some measure recovered
from the consequences his accident
and received passively though not
without wonder the tokens kindness
with which he was thus loaded the face
the abbot 
 the lady was strange to him and her
dress different and far more sumptuous than
any he remembered but the boy was naturally
 an undaunted temper and indeed
children are generally acute physiognomists
and not only pleased by that which is
beautiful in itself but peculiarly acute in
distinguishing and replying to the attentions
 those who really love them if
they see a person in company though a
perfect stranger who is by nature fond 
children the little imps seem to discover it
by a sort freemasonry while the awkward
attempts those who make advances
to them for the purpose recommending
themselves to the parents usually fail in
attracting their reciprocal attention the
little boy therefore appeared in some degree
sensible the lady's caresses and it
was with difficulty she withdrew herself
from his pillow to afford him leisure for
necessary repose
to whom belongs our little rescued varro
the abbot
let was the first question which the lady
 avenel put to her handmaiden liiias
when they had retired to the hall
to an old woman in the hamlet said
liiias who is even now come so far as
the porter's lodge to enquire concerning
his safety is it your pleasure that she be
admitted 
is it my pleasure said the lady 
avenel echoing the question with a strong
accent displeasure and surprise can
you make any doubt it what woman
but must pity the agony the mother
whose heart is throbbing for the safety 
a child so lovely
 nay but madam said liiias this
woman is too old to be the mother the
child i rather think she must be his grand
mother or some more distant relation
be she who she will liiias replied
the lady she must have a sore heart
while the safety a creature so lovely is
uncertain go instantly and bring her hithe
abbot 
ther besides i would willingly learn something
concerning his birth
lilias left the hall and presently afterwards
returned ushering in a tall female
very poorly dressed yet with more pretension
to decency and cleanliness than was
usually combined with such coarse garments
the lady avenel knew her figure
the instant she presented herself it
was the fashion the family that upon
every sabbath and on two evenings in the
week besides henry warden preached or
lectured in the chapel the castle the
extension the protestant faith was upon
principle as well as in good policy a primary
object with the knight avenel
the inhabitants the village were therefore
invited to attend upon the instructions
 henry warden and many them were
speedily won to the doctrine which their
master and protector approved these sermons
homilies and lectures had made a
great impression on the mind the abbot
 the abbot
eustace or eustatius and were a sufficient
spur to the severity and sharpness his
controversy with his old fellow collegiate 
and he more than once threatened to levy
his vassals and assail and level with the earth
that strong hold heresy the castle 
but notwithstanding his impotent resentment
and notwithstanding also the disinclination
 the country to favour the new
religion henry warden proceeded without
remission in his labours and made weekly
converts from the faith rome to that 
the reformed church amongst those who
gave most earnest and constant attendance
on his ministry was the aged woman whose
form too tall and otherwise too remarkable
to be forgotten the lady had late remarked
frequently as being conspicuous
amongst the little audience she had indeed
more than once desired to know who
that tall statelylooking woman was whose
appearance was so much above the poverty
 her vestments but the reply had althe
abbot 
ways been that she was an english woman
who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet
and that no one knew more concerning
her she now asked her after her name
and birth
magdalen graeme is my name said the
woman i come the grammes head
in nicolforest a people ancient
blood
and what make you continued the
lady so far distant from your home 
i have no home said magdalen grime
it was burnt by your borderriders my
husband and my son were slain there is
not a drop's blood left in the veins anyone
which is kin to mine
 that is no uncommon fate in these wild
times and in this unsettled land said the
lady the english hands have been as
deeply dyed in our blood as ever those 
scotsmen have been in yours
you have right to say it lady answered
magdalen graeme for men tell
 a time when this castle was not strong
b 
 the abbot
enough to save your father's life or to afford
your mother and her infant a place 
refuge and why ask ye me then wherefore
i dwell not in mine own home and
with my own people 
it was indeed an idle question where
misery so often makes wanderers butchered
take refuge in a hostile country 
my neighbours were popish and massinger
said the old woman it has
pleased heaven to give me a clearer sight
 the gospel and i have tarried here to
enjoy the ministry that worthy man henry
warden who to the praise and comfort
 many teacheth the evangel in truth and
in sincerity
 are you poor again demanded the
lady avenel
you hear me ask alms no one answered
the englishwoman
here there was a pause the manner 
the woman was if not disrespectful at least
much less than gracious and she appeared
to give no encouragement to farther comthe
abbot s
medication the lady avenel renewed
the conversation on a different topic
you have heard the danger in which
your boy has been placed 
 i have lady and how by an especial
providence he was rescued from death may
heaven make him thankful and me 
 what relation do you bear to him 
 i am his grandmother lady if it so
please you the only relation he hath left
upon earth to take charge him
the burthen his maintenance must
necessarily be grievous to you in your deserted
situation pursued the lady
i have complained it to no one
said magdalen graeme with the same unmoved
dry and unconcerned tone voice
in which she had answered all the former
questions
 if said the lady avenel your
grandchild could be received into a noble
family would it not advantage both him
and you 
 the abbot
 received into a noble family said
the old woman drawing herself up and
bending her brows until her forehead
was wrinkled into a frown unusual severity
 and for what purpose i pray
you to be my lady's page or my lord's
jackman to eat broken victuals and contend
with other menials for the remnants
 the master's meal would you have
him to fan the flies from my lady's face
while she sleeps to carry her train while
she walks to hand her trencher when she
feeds to ride before her on horseback to
valk after her on foot to sing when she
lists and to be silent when she bids a very
weathercock which though furnished in
appearance with wings and plumage cannot
soar into the air cannot fly from the
spot where it is perched but receives all its
impulses and performs all its revolutions
obedient to the changeful breath a vain
woman when the eagle helvellyn
perches on the tower lanercost and
turns and changes to shew how the wind
the abbor 
sits roland grasme shall be what you would
make him
the woman spoke with a rapidity and
vehemence which seemed to have in it a
touch insanity and a sudden sense the
danger to which the child must necessarily
be exposed in the charge such a keeper
increased the lady's desire to keep him in
the castle if possible
 you mistake me dame she said addressing
the old woman in a soothing manner
 i do not wish your boy to be in attendance
on myself but upon the good
knight my husband were he himself the
son a belted earl he could not better
be trained to arms and all that befits a gentleman
than by the instructions and discipline
 sir halbert glendinning
 ay answered the old woman in the
same style bitter irony i know the
wages that service a curse when the
corslet is not sufficiently brightened a
blow when the girth is not tightly drawn
to be beaten because the hounds are at fault
 the abbot
to be reviled because the foray is unsuccessful
 to stain his hands for the master's
bidding in the blood alike beast and
 man to be a butcher harmless deer
a murderer and deface god's own image
not at his own pleasure but at that his
lord to live a brawling ruffian and a common
stabber exposed to heat to cold to
want food to all the privations an anchoret
not for the love god but for
the service satan to die by the gibbet
or in some obscure skirmish to sleep out
his life in carnal security and to awake in
the eternal fire which is never quenched
nay said the lady avenel but
to such unhallowed course life your
grandson will not be here exposed my
husband is just and kind to those who live
under his banner and you yourself well
know that youth have here a strict as well
as a good preceptor in the person our
chaplain
the old woman appeared to pause
you have named she said the onthe
abbot 
ly circumstance which can move me i
must soon onward the vision has said it 
i must not tarry in the same spot i must
on i must on it is my weird swear then
that you will protect the boy as if he were
your own until i return hither and claim
him and i will consent for a space to part
with him but especially swear he shall
not lack the instruction the godly man
who hath placed the gospeltruth high
above these idolatrous shavings the
monks and friars
be satisfied dame said the lady 
avenel j the boy shall have as much care
as if he were born my own blood will
you see him now 
no answered the old woman sternly
 to part is enough i go forth on
my own mission i will not soften my
heart by useless tears and failings as one
that is not called to a duty
will you not accept something to
aid you in your pilgrimage said the lady
 avenel putting into her hand two
 the abbot
crowns the sun the old woman flung
them down on the table
 am i the race cain she said
 proud lady that you offer me gold in
exchange for my own flesh and blood 
 i had no such meaning said the lady
gently nor am i the proud woman you
term me alas my own fortunes might
have taught me humility even had it not
been born with me
the old woman seemed somewhat to
relax her tone severity
you are gentle blood she said
 else we had not parleyed thus long together
 you are gentle blood and to
such she added drawing up her tall form
as she spoke pride is as graceful as is
the plume upon the bonnet but for these
pieces gold lady you must needs resume
them i need not money i am
well provided and i may not care for myself
nor think how or by whom i shall be
sustained farewell and keep your word
the abbot 
cause your gates to be opened and your
bridges to be lowered i will set forward
this very night when i come again i
will demand from you a strict account for
 have left with you the jewel my life i
sleep will visit me but in snatches food
will not refresh me rest will not restore my
strength until i see roland grseme once
more farewell
make your obeisance dame said
lilias to magdalen graeme as she retired
make your obeisance to her ladyship
and thank her for her goodness as is but
fitting and right
the old woman turned short round on
the officious waitingmaid let her make
her obeisance to me then and i will return
it why should i bend to her is it
because her kirtle is silk and mine 
blue lockers go to my lady's waitingwoman
know that the rank the man
rates that the wife and that she who
marries a churl's son were she a king's
daughter is but a peasant's bride
 the abbot
lilias was about to reply in great indignation
but her mistress imposed silence on
her and commanded that the old woman
should be safely conducted to the mainland

 conduct her safe exclaimed the incensed
waitingwoman while magdalen
graeme left the apartment i say duck
her in the loch and then we will see
whether she is witch or not as every body in
the village lochside will say and swear
i marvel your ladyship could bear so long
with her insolence but the commands
 the lady were obeyed and the old dame
dismissed from the castle was committed
to her fortune she kept her word and
did not long abide in that place leaving
the hamlet on the very night succeeding
the interview and wandering no one
asked whither the lady avenel enquired
under what circumstances she had
appeared among them but could only learn
that she was believed to be the widow
 some man consequence among the
the abbot 
grammes who then inhabited the debateable
land a name given to a certain portion
 territory which was the frequent
subject dispute betwixt scotland and
england that she had suffered great wrong
in some the frequent forays by which
that unfortunate district was wasted and
had been driven from her dwelling place
she had arrived in the hamlet no one knew
for what purpose and was held by some to
be a witch by others a catholic devotee
her language was mysterious and her
manners repulsive and all that could be
collected from her conversation seemed to
imply that she was under the influence
either a spell or a vow there was
no saying which since she talked as one
who acted under a powerful and external
agency
such were the particulars which the
lady's enquiries were able to collect concerning
magdalen graeme being far too
meagre to authorise any satisfactory deduction
in truth the miseries the time
 the abbot
and the various turns fate incidental to
a frontier country were perpetually chasing
from their habitations those who had not
the means defence or protection these
wanderers in the land were too often seen
to excite much attention or sympathy
they received the cold relief which was
extorted by general feelings humanity j a
little excited in some breasts and perhaps
rather chilled in others by the recollection
that they who gave the charity today might
themselves want it tomorrow magdalen
graeme therefore came and departed like
a shadow from the neighbourhood 
castle
the boy whom providence as she thought
had thus strangely placed under her care
was at once established a favourite with
the lady the castle how could it be
otherwise he became the object those
affectionate feelings which finding formerly
no object on which to expand themselves
had encreased the gloom the
the abbot 
castle and embittered the solitude its
mistress to teach him as far as her skill
went to attend to his childish comforts to
watch his boyish sports became the lady's
favourite amusement in her circumstances
where the ear only heard the lowing
 the cattle from the distant hills or
the heavy step the warder as he walked
upon his post or the half envied laugh
 her maiden as she turned her wheel the
appearance the blooming and beautiful
boy gave an interest which can hardly be
conceived by those who live amid gayer
or busier scenes young roland was to
the lady avenel what the flower which
occupies the window some solitary captive
is to the poor wight by whom it is
nursed and cultivated something which
at once excited and repaid her care and in
giving the boy her affection she felt as it
were grateful to him for releasing her from
the state dull apathy in which she had
usually found herself during the absence 
sir halbert glendinning
 the abbot
but even the charms this blooming
favourite were unable to chase the recurring
apprehensions which arose from her
husband's delayed return soon after roland
graeme became a resident at the
castle a groom dispatched by sir albert
brought tidings that business importance
still delayed the knight at the
court holyrood the more distant period
which the messenger had assigned for
his master's arrival at length glided away
summer melted into autumn and autumn
was about to give place to winter and yet
he came not
the abbot 
chapter iii
the waning harvestmoon shone broad and bright
the warder's horn was heard at dead night
and while the folding portals wide were flung
with tramping hoofs the rocky pavement rung
leyden
and you too would be a soldier roland
said the lady avenel to her
young charge while seated on a stone
chair at one the battlements she
saw the boy attempt with a long stick to
mimic the motions the warder as he alternately
shouldered or ported or sloped
pike
yes lady said the boy for he was
now familiar and replied to her questions
with readiness and alacrity a soldier will
i be for there ne'er was gentleman but
who belled him with the brand
 the abbot
 thou a gentleman said lilias who
as usual was in attendance such a
gentleman as i would make a bean cod
with a rusty knife
nay chide him not lilias said the
lady avenel for beshrew me but i
think he comes gentle blood see how
it musters in his face at your injurious reproofs

had i my will madam answered lilies
 a good birchen wand should make
his colour muster to better purpose still
on my word lilias said the lady
one would think you had received harm
from the poor boy or is he so far on the
frosty side your favour because he enjoys
the sunny side mine 
over heavens forbode my lady answered
lilias i have lived too long
with gentles i praise my stars for it to
fight with either follies or fantasies whether
they elate to beast bird or boy
lilias was a favourite in her own class
a spoiled domestic who was often accusthe
abbot 
toned to take more license than her mistress
was at all times willing to encourage
but what did not please the lady 
she did not chuse to hear and thus it
was on the present occasion she resolved
to look more close and sharply after the boy
who had hitherto been committed chiefly
to the management lilias he must she
thought be born gentle blood it were
shame to think otherwise a form so noble
and features so fair the very wildness
in which he occasionally indulged his contempt
 danger and impatience restraint
had in them something noble assuredly
the child was born high rank such
was her conclusion and she acted upon it
accordingly the domestics around her
less jealous or less scrupulous than lilias
acted as servants usually do following the
bias and flattering for their own purposes
the humour the lady and the boy soon
took on him those airs superiority which
the sight habitual deference seldom fails
vol i c
 the abbot
to inspire it seemed in truth as if to
command were his natural sphere so easily
did he use himself to exact and receive
compliance with his humours the chaplain
indeed might have interposed to
check the air superiority which roland
greene so readily indulged and most probably
would have willingly rendered him
that favour but the necessity adjusting
with his brethren some disputed points 
church discipline had withdrawn him for
some time from the castle and detained
him in a distant part the kingdom
matters stood thus in the castle 
when a winded bugle sent its shrill
and prolonged notes from the shore the
lake and was replied to cheerily by the
signal the warder the lady 
knew the sounds her husband and
rushed to the window the apartment in
which she was sitting a band about
thirty spearmen with a pennon displayed
before them winded along the indented
shores the lake and approached the
the abbot 
causeway a single horseman rode at the
head the party his bright arms catching
a glance the october sun as he moved
steadily along even at that distance the
lady recognized the lofty plume bearing
the mingled colours her own liveries
blended with the hollybranch and the
firm seat and dignified demeanour the
rider joined to the stately motion the
darkbrown steed sufficiently announced
halbert glendinning
the lady's first thought was that rapturous
joy at her husband's return her second
was connected with a fear which had
sometimes intruded itself that he might
not altogether approve the peculiar distinction
with which she had treated her orphan
ward in this fear there was implied
a consciousness that the favour she had
shewn him was excessive for halbert glendining
was at least as gentle and indulgent
as he was firm and rational in the intercourse
 his household and to her in
 the abbot
particular his conduct had ever been most
affectionately tender
yet she did fear that on the present occasion
her conduct might incur sir albert's
censure and hastily resolving that
she would not mention the anecdote the
boy until the next day she ordered him to
be withdrawn from the apartment by lilies

 i will not go with lilias madam answered
the spoiled child who had more
than once carried his point by perseverance
and who like his betters delighted in the
exercise such authority i will not
go to lilias's gouty room i will stay and
see that brave warrior who comes riding so
gallantly along the drawbridge
 you must not stay roland said the
lady more positively than she usually spoke
to her little favourite
 i will reiterated the boy who had
already felt his consequence and the probable
chance success
the abbot 
you will roland answered the lady
what manner word is that i tell you
you must go
wil answered the forward boy is
a word for a man and must is no word fora
lady
you are saucy sirrah said the lady 
lilias take him with you instantly
i always thought said lilias smiling
as she seized the reluctant boy by the arm
that my young master must give place to
my old one
and you too are malapert mistress
said the lady j hath the moon changed
that ye all you thus forget yourselves 
lilias made no reply but led off the boy
who too proud to offer unavailing resistance
darted at his benefactress a glance
which intimated plainly how willingly he
would have defied her authority had he possessed
the power to make good his point
the lady avenel was vexed to find
how much this trifling circumstance had
discomposed her at the moment when she
 the abbot
ought naturally to have been entirely engrossed
by her husband's return but we
do not recover composure by the mere
feeling that agitation is mistimed the
glow displeasure had not left the lady's
cheek her ruffled deportment was not yet
entirely composed when her husband unhelmet
but still wearing the rest his
arms entered the apartment his appearance
banished the thoughts every thing
else she rushed to him clasped his ironsheathed
frame in her arms and kissed his
martial and manly face with an affection
which was at once evident and sincere
the warrior returned her embrace and her
caress with the same fondness for the time
which had passed since their union had diminished
its romantic ardour perhaps but
had rather increased its rational tenderness
and sir halbert glendinning's long and frequent
absences from his castle had prevented
affection from degenerating into indifference

when the first eager greetings were paid
the abbot 
and received the lady gazed fondly on her
husband's face as she remarked
 you are altered halbert you have ridden
hard and far today or you have been
ill
 i have been well mary answered the
knight passing well have i been and a
long ride is to me thou well knowest but a
thing constant custom those who are
born noble may slumber out their lives within
the walls their castles and manorhouses 
but he who hath achieved nobility by his
own deeds must ever be in the saddle to
shew that he merits his advancement
while he spoke thus the lady gazed fondly
on him as if endeavouring to read his
inmost soul for the tone in which he spoke
was that melancholy depression
sir halbert glendinning was the same
yet a different person from what he had appeared
in his early years the fiery freedom
 the aspiring youth had given place
to the steady and stern composure the
approved soldier and skilful politician
 ihe abbot
there were deep traces care on those
noble features over which each emotion
used formerly lo pass like light clouds
across a summer sky that sky was now
not perhaps clouded but still and grave
like that the sober autumn evening the
forehead was higher and more bare than in
early youth and the locks which still clustered
thick and dark on the warrior's head
were worn away at the temples not by age
but by the constant pressure the steel
cap or helmet his beard according to
the fashion the times grew short and
thick and was turned into mustachios on
the upper lip and peaked at the extremity
the cheek weatherbeaten and embroiled
had lost the glow youth but shewed
the vigorous complexion active and confirmed
manhood halbert glendinning was
in a word a knight to ride at a king's
right hand to bear his banner in war and
to be his counsellor in time peace for
his looks expressed the considerate firmness
which can resolve wisely and dare boldly
the abbot 
still over these noble features there now
spread an air dejection which perhaps
the owner was not conscious but
which did not escape the observation his
anxious and affectionate partner
 something has happened or is about
to happen said the lady avenel this
sadness sits not on your brow without cause
misfortune national or particular must
needs be at hand
 there is nothing new that i wot 
said halbert glendinning j but there is
little evil which can befall a kingdom
which may not be apprehended in this unhappy
and divided realm
 nay then said the lady i see there
hath really been some fatal work on foot
my lord murray has not so long detained
you at holyrood save that he wanted
your help in some weighty purpose
i have not been at holyrood mary
answered the knight j i have been several
weeks abroad
c 
 the abbot
abroad and sent me no word replied
the lady
what would the knowledge have availed
but to have rendered you unhappy my
love replied the knight your thoughts
would have converted the slightest breeze
that curled your own lake into a tempest
raging in the german ocean
and have you then really crossed the
sea said the lady to whom that idea
conveyed notions terror and wonder j
really left your own native land and
trodden distant shores where the scottish
tongue is unheard and unknown 
really and really said the knight
taking her hand in affectionate playfulness
i have done this marvellous deed have
rolled on the ocean for three days and
three nights with the deep green waves
dashing by the side my pillow and buta
thin plank to divide me from it
indeed my halbert said the lady
 that was a tempting divine province
abbot 
hence i never bade you unbuckle the
sword from your side or lay the lance from
your hand i never bade you sit when
your honour called to rise but are not
blade and spear dangerous enough to one
man's life and why would you trust rough
waves and raging seas 
we have in germany and in the low
countries as they are called answered
glendinning men who are united with
us in faith and with whom it is fitting we
should unite in alliance to some these
i was dispatched on business as important
as it was secret went in safety and i
returned in security there is more danger
to a man's life betwixt this and holyrood
than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands
 holland
and the country my halbert and
the people said the lady are they like
our kindly scots or what bearing have they
to strangers 
 they are a people mary strong in
their wealth which renders all other nato
the abbot
tions weak and weak in those arts war
by which other nations are strong
 i do not understand you said the
lady
the hollander and the fleming mary
pour forth their spirit in trade and not in
war their wealth purchases them the arms
 foreign soldiers by whose aid they defend
it they erect dykes on the sea shore
to protect the land which they have won
and they levy regiments the stubborn
sitters and hardy germans to protect the
treasures which they have amassed and
thus they are strong in their weakness for
the very wealth which tempts their masters
to despoil them arms strangers in their
behalf
the slothful hinds exclaimed mary
thinking and feeling like a scotswoman 
the period have they hands and fight
not for the land which bore them they
should be notched off at the elbow
nay that were but hard justice answered
her husband for their hands
the abbot 
serve their country though not in battle
like ours look at these barren hills mary
and at that deep winding vale by which the
cattle are even now returning from their
scanty browse the hand the industrious
fleming would cover these mountains
with wood and raise corn where we now
see a starved and scanty sward heath
and ling it grieves me mary when i
look on that land and think what benefit
it might receive from such men as i have
lately seen men who seek not the idle
fame derived from dead ancestors or the
bloody renown won in modern broils but
tread along the land as preservers and improvers
not as tyrants and destroyers
 these amendments would be but a
vain fancy my halbert answered the lady
 avenel the trees would be burned
by the english foemen ere they ceased to
be shrubs and the grain that you raised
would be gathered in by the first neighbour
that possessed more riders than follow your
train why should you repine at this the
 the abbot
fate that made you scotsman by birth gave
you head and heart and hand to uphold
the name as it must needs be upheld
 it gave ene no name to uphold said
halbert pacing the floor slowly my arm
has been foremost in every strife my voice
has been heard in every council nor have
the wisest rebuked me the crafty lexington
the deep and dark morton have
held secret council with me and grange
and lindsay have owned that in the field i
did the devoir a gallant knight but let
the emergence be passed when they need
my head and hand and they only know meas
son the obscure portioner glendear

this was a theme which the lady always
dreaded for the rank conferred on her husband
the favour in which he was held by
the powerful earl murray and the high
talents by which he vindicated his right to
that rank and that favour were qualities
which rather encreased than diminished the
envy which was harboured against sir halthe
abbot 
bert glendinning as a person originally 
inferior and obscure birth who had risen to
his present eminence solely by his personal
merit the natural firmness his mind
did not enable him to despise the ideal advantages
 a high pedigree which were
held in such universal esteem by all with
whom he conversed and so open are the
noblest minds to jealous inconsistencies
that there were moments in which he felt
mortified that his lady should possess those
advantages birth and high descent which
he himself did not enjoy and regretted that
his importance as the proprietor avenel
was qualified by his possessing it only as
the husband the heiress he was not so
unjust as to permit any unworthy feelings
to retain permanent possession his mind
but yet they recurred from time to time
and did not escape his lady's anxious observation

 had we been blessed with children
she was wont on such occasions to say to
herself had our blood been united in a
f the abbot

son who might have joined my advantages
 descent with my husband's personal
worth these painful and irksome reflections
had not disturbed our union even fora
moment but the existence such an
heir in idiom our affections as well as our
pretensions might have centered has been
denied to us
with such mutual feelings it cannot be
wondered at that the lady heard her husband
with pain verging towards this topic
 mutual discontent on the present as
on other similar occasions she endeavoured
to divert her husband's thoughts from
this painful channel
 how can you she said suffer yourself
to dwell upon thoughts which profit nothing
 have you indeed no name to uphold
 you the good and the brave the
wise in council and the strong in battle
have you not to support the reputation your
own deeds have won a reputation more honourable
than mere ancestry can supply 
good men love and honour you the wickthe
abbot 
ed fear and the turbulent obey you and is
it not necessary you should exert yourself
to ensure the endurance that love that
honour that wholesome fear and that necessary
obedience 
as she thus spoke the eye her husband
caught from her's courage and comfort
and it lightened as he took her hand
and replied 
the abbot 
grasme the prejudices wolf were easily
overcome and in process time the dog
slept with bran loath and the celebrated
hounds ancient days but mr warden
the chaplain lived and retained his dislike
to the youth that good man singleminded
and benevolent as he really was entertained
rather more than a reasonable idea 
the respect due to him as a minister and
exacted from the inhabitants the castle
more deference than the haughty young
page proud his mistress's favour and
petulant from youth and situation was at
all times willing to pay his bold and free
demeanour his attachment to rich dress
and decoration his inaptitude to receive
instruction and his hardening himself
against rebuke were circumstances which
induced the good old man with more
haste than charity to set the forward page
down as a vessel wrath and to presage
that the youth nursed that pride and
haughtiness spirit which goes before
ruin and destruction most the attends
the abbot
ants and followers sir halbert glendining
entertained the same charitable
thought but while roland was favoured
by their lady and endured by their lord
they saw no policy in making their opinions
public
koland grasme was sufficiently sensible
 the unpleasant situation in which he
stood but in the haughtiness his heart
he retorted upon the other domestics the
distant cold and sarcastic manner in which
they treated him assumed an air superiority
which compelled the most obstinate
to obedience and had the satisfaction to
be dreaded at least if he was heartily hated

the chaplain's marked dislike had the
effect recommending him to the attention
 sir halbert's brother edward who
now under the conventual appellation 
father ambrose continued to be one 
the few monks who with the abbot eustathius
were still permitted to linger in the
cloisters at kennaquhair respect to sir
the abbot 
halbert had prevented their being altogether
driven out the abbey though their
order was now in a great measure suppressed
and they were interdicted the public
exercise their ritual and only allowed
for their support a small pension out
 their once splendid revenues father
ambrose thus situated was an occasional
though very rare visitant at the castle 
avenel and was at such times observed to
pay particular attention to roland graeme
who seemed to return it with more depth
 feeling than consisted with his usual habits

thus situated years glided on during
which the knight avenel continued to
act a frequent and important part in the
convulsions his distracted country while
young graeme anticipated both in wishes
and in personal accomplishments the age
which should enable him to emerge from
the obscurity his present situation
d 
 the abbot
chapter 
amid their cups that freely flow'd
their revelry and mirth
a youthful lord taxed valentine
with hase and doubtful birth
valentine and arson
when roland greene was a youth about
seventeen years age he chanced one
summer morning to descend to the mew in
which sir halbert glendinning kept his
hawks in order to superintend the training
 an eyass or young hawk which he himself
at the imminent risk neck and
limbs had taken from a celebrated eyrie
in the neighbourhood called gledscraig
as he was by no means satisfied with the
attention which had been bestowed on his
favourite bird he was not slack in testifythe
abbot 
ing his displeasure to the falconer's lad
whose duty it was to have attended upon
it
what ho sir knave exclaimed roland
 is it thus you feed the eyasse with
unwashed meat as if you were gorging the
foul branches a worthless hodie crow
by the mass and thou hast neglected its
castings also for these two days thinks
thou i ventured my neck to bring the bird
down from the craig that thou shouldst
spoil him by thy neglect and to add
force to his remonstrances he conferred a
cuff or two on the negligent attendant 
the hawks who shouting rather louder than
was necessary under all the circumstances
brought the master falconer to his assistance

adam woodcock the falconer avenet
was an englishman by birth but so
long in the service glendinning that he
had lost his national attachment in that 
which he had formed to his master he
 the abbot
was a favourite in his department jealous
and conceited his skill as masters the
game usually are for the rest his character
he was a jester and a parcel poet qualities
which by no means abated his natural
conceit a jolly fellow who loved a flagon
 ale better than a long sermon a stout
man his hands when need required true
to his master and a little presuming on his
interest with him
adam woodcock such as we have described
him by no means relished the freedom
used by young grime in chastising
his assistant hey hey my lady's page
said he stepping between his own boy and
roland fair and softly an it like your
gilt jacket hands off is fair play if my
boy has done amiss i can beat him myself
and then you may keep your hands soft
 i will beat him and thee too answered
roland without hesitation an you
look not better after your business see
how the bird is cast away between you
the abbot 
i found the careless lurdane feeding him
with unwashed flesh and she an eyass
 go to said the falconer thou art
but an eyass thyself child roland what
knowest thou feeding i say that the
eyass should have her meat unwashed until
she becomes a branches twere the ready
way to give her the trounce to wash her
meat sooner and so knows every one who
knows a gled from a falcon
it is thine own laziness thou false
english blood that doest nothing but drink
and sleep retorted the page and leaves
that lither lad to do the work that he minds
as little as thou
 and am i so idle then said the falconer
 that have three cast hawks to
look after at perch and mew and to fly
them in the field to boot and is my lady's
page so busy a man that he must take me
up short and am i a false english blood 
there is a difference amongst authorities how long the
nesting hawk should he fed with flesh which has previously
been washed
 the abbot
i marvel what blood thou art neither
englander nor scot fish nor flesh a bastard
from the debateable land without
either kith kin or ally marry out upon
thee foul kite that would fain be a tercel
gentle
the reply to this sarcasm was a box on
the ear so well applied that it overthrew
the falconer into the cistern in which water
was kept for the benefit the hawks up
started adam woodcock and seizing on a
truncheon which stood by would have soon
requited the injury he had received had not
roland laid his hand on his poniard and
sworn by all that was sacred that if he
offered a stroke towards him he would
sheath it in his bowels the noise was now
so great that more than one the houscr j
hold came in and amongst others the 
a grave personage already mentioned
whose gold chain and white wand
intimated his authority at the appearance
 this dignitary the strife was for the
present appeased he embraced however
the abbot 
so favourable an opportunity to read roland
grseme a shrewd lecture on the impropriety
 his deportment to his fellowmenials
and to assure him that should he
communicate this fray to his master who
though now on one his frequent expeditions
was speedily expected to return
which but for respect to his lady he would
most certainly do the residence the
culprit in the castle avenel would be
but brief duration but however
added the prudent master the household
 i will report the matter first to my lady
very just very right master wingate
exclaimed several voices together my
lady will consider if daggers are to be
drawn on us for every idle word and whether
we are to live in a wellordered household
where there is the fear god or
amongst drawn dirks and sharp knives
the object this general resentment
darted an angry glance around him and
suppressing with difficulty the desire which
urged him to reply in furious or in cons
the abbot
temp tous language returned his dagger into
the scabbard looked disdainfully around
upon the assembled menials turned short
upon his heel and pushing aside those who
stood betwixt him and the door left the
apartment
 this will be no tree for my nest said
the falconer if this cocksparrow is to
crow over us as he seems to do
he struck me with his switch yesterday
said one the grooms because
the tail his worship's gelding was not
trimmed altogether so as suited his humour

 and i promise you said the laundress
 my young master will stick nothing
to call you slut and quean if there
be but a speck soot upon his bandcollar

 if master wingate do not his errand
to my lady was the general result there
will be no tarrying in the same house with
koland graeme
the master the household heard them
the abbot 
all for some time and then motioning for
universal silence he addressed them with all
the dignity malvolio himself my masters
 not forgetting you my mistresses
do not think the worse me that i proceed
with as much care as haste in this
matter our master is a gallant knight
and will have his sway at home and abroad
in wood and field in hall and bower as the
saying is our lady my benison upon her
is also a noble person long descent and
rightful heir this place and barony and
she also loves her will as for that matter
shew me the woman who doth not now
she hath favoured doth favour and will favour
thisjackanape for what good part
about him i know not save that as one
noble lady will love a messan dog and another
a screaming popinjay and a third a
barbary ape so doth it please our noble
dame to set her affections upon this stray
elf a page for nought that i can think
off save that she was the cause his being
 the abbot
saved the more's the pity from drowning
and here master wingate made a
pause
i would have been his caution for a
grey groat against salt water or fresh said
his adversary the falconer marry if he
crack not a rope for stabbing or for snatching
i will be content never to hood hawk
again
peace adam woodcock said wingate
waving his hand i prithee peace
man snow my lady liking this springald
as aforesaid differs therein from my lord
whp likes never a bone in his skin now
is it for me to stir up strife betwixt them
and put as twere my finger betwixt the
bark and the tree on account a pragmatical
youngster whom nevertheless i
would willingly see whipped forth the
barony have patience and this boil will
break without our meddling i have been
in service since i wore a beard on my chin
till now that that beard is turned grey
and i have seldom known any one better
the abbot 
themselves even by taking the lady's part
against the lord's but never one who did
not dirk himself if he took the lord's
against the lady's
 and so said lilias we are to be
crowed over every one us men and
women cock and hen by this little upstart
 i will try titles with him first i promise
you i fancy master wingate for
as wise as you look you will be pleased to
tell what you have seen today if my lady
commands you
 to speak the truth when my lady
commands me answered the prudential
majordomo is in some measure my
duty mistress lilias always providing for
and excepting those cases in which it cannot
be spoken without breeding mischief
and inconvenience to myself or my fellowservants
 for the tongue a talebearer
breaketh bones as well as a jeddart staif
but this imp satan is none your
friends or fellowservants said lilias
 the abbor
 and i trust you mean not to stand up for
him against the whole family besides 
 credit me mrs lilias replied the
senior should i see the time fitting i
would with right good will give him a lick
with the rough side my tongue
 enough said master wingate answered
lilias then trust me his song
shall soon be laid if my mistress does not
ask me what is the matter below stairs before
she be ten minutes time older she
is no born woman and my name is not
lilias bradbourne
in pursuance her plan mistress lilies
failed not to present herself before her
mistress with all the exterior one who
is possessed an important secret that
is she had the corner her mouth turned
down her eyes raised up her lips pressed
as fast together as if they had been sewed
up to prevent her blabbing and an air 
prim mystical importance diffused over her
whole person and demeanour which seemthe
abbot 
ed to intimate i know something which
 am resolved not to tell you 
lilias had rightly read her mistress's temper
who wise and good as she was was yet
a daughter grandame eve and could not
witness this mysterious bearing on the part
 her waitingwoman without longing to ascertain
the secret cause for a space mrs
lilias was obdurate to all enquiries sighed
turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven
hoped for the best but had nothing particular
to communicate all this as was most
natural and proper only stimulated the lady's
curiosity neither was her importunity
to be parried with thank god i am no
makebate no talebearer thank god i
never envied any one's favour or was anxious
to people their misdemeanour only
thank god there has been no bloodshed
and murder in the house that is all
bloodshed and murder exclaimed the
lady what does the quean mean if you
speak not plain out you shall have something
you will scarce be thankful for
w
 the abbot
 nay my lady answered lilias eager
to disburse her mind or in chaucer's
phrase to unbuckle her mail if you bid
me speak out the truth you must not be
moved with what might displease you 
roland graeme has tired adam woodcock
 that is all
 good heaven said the lady turning
pale as ashes is the man slain 
 no madam replied lilias but slahi
he would have been if there had not been
ready help but may be it is your ladyship's
pleasure that this young esquire shall
poniard the servants as well as switch and
barton them
 go to minion said the lady you
are saucytell the master the household
to attend me instantly
lilias hastened to seek out mr wingate
and hurry him to his lady's presence speaking
as a word in season to him on the way
i have set the stone strolling look that
you do not let it stand still
the steward too prudential a person to
the abbot 
commit himself otherwise answered by a
sly look and a nod intelligence and presently
after stood in the presence the
lady avenel with a look great respect
for his lady partly real partly affected
and an air great sagacity which inferred
no ordinary conceit himself
how is this wingate said the lady
and what rule do you keep in the castle
that the domestics sir halbert blending
draw the dagger on each other as ina
cavern thieves and murtherers is the
wounded man much hurt and what what
hath become the unhappy boy 
there is no one wounded as yet madam
replied he the golden chain it
passes my poor skill to say how many maybe
wounded before pasche if some rule be
not taken with this youth not but the
youth is a fair youth he added corrective
himself and able at his exercise but
easter
 the abbor
somewhat too ready with the ends his
fingers the butt his riding switch and
the point his dagger
 and whose fault is that said the lady
 but yours who should have taught him
better discipline than to brawl or to draw
his dagger 
if it please your ladyship so to impose
the blame on me answered the steward
it is my part doubtless to bear it only i
submit to your consideration that unless i
nailed his weapon to the scabbard i could
no more keep it still than i could fix quicksilver
which defied even the skill raymond
nullius
tell me not raymond nullius said
the lady losing patience but send me the
chaplain hither you grow all you too
wise for me during your lord's long and
repeated absences i would to god his affairs
would permit him to remain at home
and rule his own household for it passes my
wit and skill 
 god forbid my lady said the old dothe
abbot 
mystic that you should sincerely think
what you are now pleased to say your old
servants might well hope that after so many
years duty you would do their service more
justice than to distrust their grey hairs because
they cannot rule the peevish humour
 a green head which the owner carries
it may be a brace inches higher than
becomes him
 leave me said the lady j sir albert's
return must now be expected daily
and he will look into these matters himself
leave me i say wingate without saying
more it i know you are honest and i
believe the boy is petulant and yet i think
it is my favour which hath set all you
against him
the steward bowed and retired after
having been silenced in a second attempt
to explain the motives on which he acted
the chaplain arrived but neither from
him did the lady receive much comfort
on the contrary she found him disposed
in plain terms to lay to the door her invol
i e
 tae abbot
dulgence all the disturbances which the
fiery temper roland graeme had already
occasioned or might hereafter occasion in
the family i would he said honoured
lady that you had deigned to be ruled by
me in the outset this matter sith it is
easy to stem evil in the fountain but hard
to struggle against it in the stream you
honoured madam a word which i do not
use according to the vain forms this
world bit because i have ever loved and
honoured you as an honourable and an
elect lady you i say madam have been
pleased contrary to my poor but earnest
counsel to raise this boy from his station
into one approaching to your own
 what mean you reverend sir said
the lady i have made this youth a page
is there aught in my doing so that does
not become my character and quality 
i dispute not madam said the pertinacious
preacher your benevolent purpose
in taking charge this youth or your
title to give him this idle character page
the abbor 
if such was your pleasure though what the
education a boy in the train a female
can tend to save to engraft foppery and
effeminacy on conceit and arrogance it
passes my knowledge to discover but i
blame you more directly for having taken
little care to guard him against the perils 
his condition or to tame and humble a spirit
naturally haughty overbearing and impatient
you have brought into your bower
a lion's cub delighted with the beauty 
his fur and the grace his gambols you
have bound him with no fetters befitting
the fierceness his disposition you have
let him grow up as unawed as if he had
been still a tenant the forest and now
you are surprised and call out for assistance
when he begins to ramp rend and
tear according to his proper nature
 mr warden said the lady considerably
offended you are my husband's ancient
friend and i believe your love sincere
to him and to his household yet let me
say that when i asked you for counsel i
 the abbot
expected not this asperity rebuke if i
have done wrong in loving this poor orphan
lad more than others his class i scarce
think the error merited such severe censure
 and if stricter discipline were required
to keep his fiery temper in order it
ought i think to be considered that i ama
woman and that if i have erred in this
matter it becomes a friend's part rather to
aid than to rebuke me i would these evils
were taken order with before my lord's return
he loves not domestic discord or
domestic brawls and i would not willingly
that he thought such could arise from
one whom i have favoured what do you
counsel me to do 
dismiss this youth from your service
madam replied the preacher
you cannot bid me do so said the
lady you cannot as a christian and a
man humanity bid me turn away an unprotected
creature against whom my favour
my injudicious favour if you will has
reared up so many enemies
i
the abbot 
it is not necessary you should altogether
abandon him though you dismiss him
to another service or to a calling better
suiting his station and character said the
preacher elsewhere he may be an useful
and profitable member the commonweal
 here he is but a makebate and a
stumblingblock offence the youth
has snatches sense and intelligence
though he lacks industry i will myself
give him letters commendatory to olearius
schinderhausen a learned professor at leyden
where they lack an underjanitor
where besides gratis instruction if god
give him the grace to seek it he will enjoy
five marks by the year and the professor's
castoff suit which he departs with
biennially
 this will never do good mr warden
said the lady scarce able to suppress a
smile we will think more at large upon
this matter in the meanwhile trust to
your remonstrances with the family for restraining
these violent and unseemly jean
the abbot
houses and bursts passion and i entreat
you to press on them their duty in
this respect towards god and towards
their master
 you shall be obeyed madam said
warden on the next thursday i exhort
the family and will with god's blessing
so wrestle with the daemon wrath
and violence which hath entered into my
little flock that i trust to hound the wolf
out the fold as if he were chased away
with bandogs
this was the part the conference from
which mr warden derived the greatest pleasure
the pulpit was at that time the same
powerful engine for affecting popular feel
ing which the press has since become and
he had been no unsuccessful preacher as
we have already seen it followed as a natural
consequence that he rather overestimated
the powers his own oratory and
like some his brethren about the period
was glad an opportunity to handle any
matters importance whether public or
thr abbor 
private the discussion which could be
dragged into his discourse in that rude age
the delicacy was unknown which prescribed
time and place to personal exhortations 
and as the courtpreacher often addressed
the king personally and dictated to him
the conduct he ought to observe in matters
 state so the nobleman himself or any 
his retainers were in the chapel the feudal
castle often incensed or appalled as the
case might be by the discussion their
private faults and by spiritual censures
directed against them specifically personally
and by name
the sermon by means which henry
warden proposed to restore concord and
good order to the castle avenel bore
for text the wellknown words he ivlio
strike with the sword shall perish by the
swyrdj and was a singular mixture good
sense and powerful oratory with pedantry
and bad taste he enlarged a good deal
on the word strike which he assured his
hearers comprehended blows given with
 the abbot
the point as well as with the edge and
more generally shooting with handgun
crossbow or longbow thrusting with a
lance or doing any thing whatsoever by
which death might be occasioned to the
adversary in the same manner he proved
satisfactorily that the word sword comprehended
all descriptions whether backsword
or baskethilt cutandthrust or rapier
falchion or scimitar but if he
continued with still greater animation
the text included in its anathema those
who strike with any those weapons
which man hath devised for the exercise 
his open hostility still more doth it comprehend
such as from their form and size
are devised rather for the gratification 
privy malice by treachery than for the destruction
 an enemy prepared and standing
upon his defence such he continued
looking sternly at the place where
the page was seated on a cushion at the
feet his mistress and wearing in his
crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded
the abbot 
hit such more especially i hold to be
those implements death which in our
modern and fantastic times are worn not
only by thieves and cutthroats to whom
they most properly belong but even by
those who attend upon women and wait
in the chambers honourable ladies yes
my friends this unhappy weapon framed
for all evil and for no good is comprehended
under this deadly denunciation
whether it be a stile which we have bo
rowed from the treacherous italian 
dirk which is borne by the savage i 
landmen or a linger which is carried your
own borderthieves and cutthrow 
a dudgeondagger which was invented by
the devil himself for a ready implement 
deadly wrath sudden to execute and difficult
to be parried even the common
sword andbuckler brawler despises the
use such a treacherous and malignant
instrument which is therefore fit to be
used not by men or soldiers but by those
who trained under female discipline bee

 the abbot
come themselves effeminate hermaphrodites
having female spite and female cowardice
added to the infirmities and evil
passions their masculine nature
the effect which this oration produced
upon the assembled congregation 
cannot very easily be described the
lady seemed at once embarrassed and offended
 the menials could hardly contain
under an affectation deep attention the
joy with which they heard the chaplain
launch his thunders at the head the unpopular
favourite mrs lilias crested and
drew up her head with all the deepfelt
pride gratified resentment while the
steward observing a strict neutrality aspect
fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon
on the opposite side the wall which he
seemed to examine with the most minute
accuracy more willing perhaps to incur
the censure being inattentive to the sermon
than that seeming to listen with
marked approbation to what appeared so
distasteful to his mistress
the abbot 
the unfortunate subject the harangue
whom nature had endowed with passions
which had hitherto found no effectual restraint
could not disguise the resentment
which he felt at being thus directly held
up to the scorn as well as the censure 
the assembled inhabitants the little world
in which he lived his brow grew red his
lip grew pale he set his teeth he clenched
his hand and then with mechanical readiness
grasped the weapon which the clergyman
had given so hideous a character 
and at length as the preacher heightened
the colouring his invective he felt his
rage become so ungovernable that fearful
 being hurried into some deed desperate
violence he rose up traversed the
chapel with hasty steps and left the congregation

the preacher was surprised into a sudden
pause while the fiery youth shot across
him like a flash lightning eyeing him ashe
passed as if he had wished to dart
from his eyes the same power blighting
 the abbot
and consuming but no sooner had he
crossed the chapel and shut with violence
behind him the door the vaulted entrance
by which it communicated with the
castle than the impropriety his conduct
supplied warden with one those
happier subjects for eloquence which
he knew how to take advantage for making
a suitable impression on his hearers
he paused for an instant and then pronounced
in a slow and solemn voice the deep
anathema he hath gone out from us because
he was not us the sick man hath
been offended at the wholesome bitter the
medicine the wounded patient hath flinched
from the friendly knife the surgeon
the sheep hath fled from the sheepfold
and delivered himself to the wolf because
he could not assume the quiet and humble
conduct demanded us by the great shepherd
 ah my brethren beware wrath 
beware pride beware the deadly and
destroying sin which so often shews itself
to our frail eyes in the garments light
the abbot 
what is our earthly honour pride and
pride only what our earthly gifts and
graces pride and vanity voyagers speak
 indian men who deck themselves with
shells and anoint themselves with pigments
and boast their attire as we do
 our miserable carnal advantages pride
could draw down the morning star from
heaven even to the verge the pit 
pride and self opinion kindled the flaming
sword which waves us off from paradise 
pride made adam mortal and a weary
wanderer on the face the earth which
he had else been lord pride brought
amongst us sin and doubles every sin it
has brought it is the outpost which the
devil and the flesh most stubbornly maintain
against the assaults grace and until
it be subdued and its barriers levelled
with the very earth there is more hope 
a fool than the sinner rend then from
your bosoms this accursed shoot the fatal
apple tear it up by the roots though
it be twisted with the cords your life
 the abbot
profit by the example the miserable sinner
that has passed from us and embrace
the means grace while it is called today
 ere your conscience is seared as with
a firebrand and your ears deafened like
those the adder and your heart hardened
like the nether millstone up then
and be doing wrestle and overcome resist
and the enemy shall flee from you 
watch and pray lest ye fall into temptation
and let the stumbling others be
your warning and your example above
all rely not on yourselves for such selfconfidence
is even the worst symptom 
the disorder itself the pharisee perhaps
deemed himself humble while he stooped
in the temple and thanked god that he
was not as other men and even as the
publican but while his knees touched
the marble pavement his head was as high
as the topmost pinnacle the temple
do not therefore deceive yourselves and
offer false coin where the purest you can
present is but as dross think not that
the abbot ill
such will pass the assay omnipotent wisdom
yet shrink not from the task because
as is my bounden duty i do not
disguise from you its difficulties selfsearching
can do much meditation can
do much grace can do all
and he concluded with a touching and
animating exhortation to his hearers to
seek divine grace which is perfected inhuman
weakness
the audience did not listen to this address
without being considerably affected 
though it might be doubted whether the
feelings triumph received from the disgraceful
retreat the favourite page did
not greatly qualify in the minds many
the exhortations the preacher to charity
and to humility and in fact the expression
 their countenances much resembled
the satisfied triumphant air a
set children who having just seen a
companion punished for a fault in which
they had no share con their task with
double glee both because they themselves
 the abbot
are out the scrape and because the culprit
is in it
with very different feelings did the lady
 avenel seek her own apartment she
felt angry at warden having made a domestic
matter in which she took a personal
interest the subject such public discussion
but this she knew the good man
claimed as a branch his christian liberty
as a preacher and also that it was vindicated
by the universal custom his brethren
but the selfwilled conduct her
protege afforded her yet deeper concern
that he had broken through in so remarkable
a degree not only the respect due to
her presence but that which was paid in
those days with such peculiar reverence
argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies
had represented him to possess and
yet so far as he had been under her own
eye she had seen no more that fiery
spirit than appeared to her to become his
years and his vivacity this opinion might
be founded in some degree on partiality j
the abbot 
in some degree too it might be owing to
the kindness and indulgence which she
had always extended to him but still she
thought it impossible that she could be totally
mistaken in the estimate she had
formed his character the extreme 
violence is scarce consistent with a course
 continued hypocrisy although lilias
charitably hinted that in some instances
they were happily united and therefore
she could not exactly trust the report 
others against her own experience and observation
the thoughts this orphan
boy clung to her heartstrings with a fondness
for which she herself was unable to
account he seemed to have been sent to
her by heaven to fill up those intervals 
languor and vacuity which deprived her 
so much enjoyment perhaps he was not
less dear to her because she well saw that
he was a favourite with no one else and
because she felt that to give him up was
to afford the judgment her husband and
others a triumph over her own j a circuit
the abbot
stance not quite indifferent to the best 
spouses either sex
in short the lady avenel formed the
internal resolution that she would not desert
her page while her page could be rationally
protected and with the view 
ascertaining how far this might be done
she caused him to be summoned to her
presence

old play
it was some time ere roland graeme appeared
the messenger his old friend
lilias had at first attempted to open the
door his little apartment with the charitable
purpose doubtless enjoying the
confusion and marking the demeanour 
the culprit but a square bit iron
ycleped a bolt was passed across the door
on the inside and prevented her charitable
purpose lilias knocked and called at intervals
 roland roland graeme 
roland graeme an emphasis on the
 the abbot
word master will you be pleased to do
up the door what ails you are you
at your prayers in private to complete the
devotion which you left unfinished in public
 surely we must have a screened seat
for you in the chapel that your gentility
may be free from the eyes common
folks still no whisper was heard in reply
 well master roland said the
waiting maid i must tell my mistress
that if she would have an answer she must
send those on errand to you who can beat
the door down
 what says your lady answered the
page from within
 marry open the door and you shall
hear answered the waitingmaid i trow
it becomes her message to be listened to
face to face and i will not for your idle
pleasure whistle it through a keyhole
your mistress's name said the page
opening the door is too fair a cover for
your impertinence what says my lady 
 that you will be pleased to come to
the abbot 
her directly in the withdrawing room
answered lilias i presume she has
some directions for you concerning the
forms to be observed in leaving chapel in
future
 say to my lady that i will directly
wait on her answered the page and returning
into his own apartment he once
more locked the door in the face the
waitingmaid
 rare courtesy muttered lilias and
returning to her mistress acquainted her
that roland graeme would wait on her
when it suited his convenience
 what is that his addition or your own
phrase lilias said the lady coolly
 nay madam replied the attendant
not directly answering the question he
looked as if he could have said much more
impertinent things than that if i had been
willing to hear them but here he comes
to answer for himself
roland graeme entered the apartment
with a loftier mien and somewhat a higher
 the abbot
colour than his wont there was embarrassment
in his manner but it was neither
that fear nor penitence
 young man said the lady what
trow you am i to think your conduct
this day 
 if it has offended you madam i am
deeply grieved replied the youth
 to have offended me alone replied
the lady were but little you have been
guilty conduct which will highly offend
your master violence to your fellowservants
and disrespect to god himself
in the person his ambassador
permit me again to reply said the
page that if i have offended my only
mistress friend and benefactress it includes
the sum my guilt and deserves
the sum my penitence sir halbert
glendinning calls me not servant nor do i
call him master he is not entitled to blame
me for chastising an insolent groom nor
do i fear the wrath heaven for treating
the abbot il
with scorn the unauthorized interference
 a meddling preacher
the lady avenel had before this seen
symptoms in her favourite boyish petulance
and impatience censure or reproof
but his present demeanour was 
a graver and more determined character
and she was for a moment at a loss how she
should treat the youth who seemed to have
at once assumed the character not only 
a man but a bold and determined one
she paused an instant and then assuming
the dignity which was natural to her she
said is it to me roland that you hold
this language is it for the purpose making
me repent the favour i have shewn
you that you declare yourself independent
both an earthly and a heavenly master 
have you forgotten what you were and
to what the loss my protection would
speedily again reduce you
 lady said the page i have forgot
nothing i remember but too much i
know that but for you i should have pes
the abbot
wished in yon blue waves pointing as he
spoke to the lake which was seen through
the window agitated by the western wind
your goodness has gone farther adam
you have protected me against the malice
 others and against my own folly you are
free if you are willing to abandon the orphan
you have reared you have left nothing
undone by him and he complains 
nothing and yet lady do not think i have
been ungrateful i have endured something
on my part which i would have borne for
the sake no one but my benefactress
 for my sake said the lady and
what is it that i can have subjected you to
endure which can be remembered with
other feelings than those thanks and gratitude

you are too just madam to require
me to be thankful for the cold neglect with
which your husband has uniformly treated
me neglect not unmingled with fixed aversion
you are too just madam to require
me to be grateful for the constant and un
the abbot 
ceasing marks scorn and malevolence
with which i have been treated by others
or for such a homily as that with which
your reverend chaplain has at my expence
this very day regaled the assembled householders

 heard mortal ears the like this 
said the waiting maid with her hands expanded
and her eyes turned up to heaven 
he speaks as if he were son an earl or
 a belted knight the least penny
the page glanced on her a look supreme
contempt but vouchsafed no other
answer his mistress who began to feel
herself seriously offended and yet sorry for
the youth's folly took up the same tone
 indeed roland you forget yourself so
strangely said she that you will tempt
me to take serious measures to lower you
in your own opinion by reducing you to
your proper station in society
 and that added lihas would be
best done by turning him out the same beggar's

lilias speaks too rudely continued the
lady but she has spoken the truth young
man nor do i think i ought to spare that
pride which hath so completely turned your
bead you have been tricked up with fine
garments and treated like the son a gentleman
until you have forgot the fountain
 your churlish blood
craving your pardon most honourable
madam lias hath spoken truth nor
does your ladyship know aught my descents
which should entitle you to treat it
with such decided scorn i am no beggar's
brat my grandmother begged from no
one here nor elsewhere she would have
perished sooner on the bare moor we
were harried out and driven from our
home a chance which has lapped elsewhere
and to others avenel castle with
its lake and its towers was not at all times
able to protect its inhabitants from want
and desolation
 hear but his assurance said lilias
 he upbraids my lady with the distresses
 her family 
the abbot 
it had indeed been a theme more gratefully
spared said the lady affected nevertheless
with the allusion
it was necessary madam for my vindication
said the page or i had not even
hinted at a word that might give you pain
but believe honoured lady i am no
churl's blood my proper descent i know
not but my only relation has said and my
heart has echoed it back and attested the
truth that i am sprung gentle blood
and deserve gentle usage
 and upon an assurance so vague as
this said the lady do you propose to expect
all the regard all the privileges due
to high rank and to distinguished birth
and become a contender for privileges
which are only due to the noble go to sir
know yourself or the master the household
shall make you know you are liable to
the scourge as a malapert boy you have
tasted too little the discipline fit for your age
and station
the master the household shall taste
 the abbot
 my dagger ere i taste his discipline
said the page giving way to his restrained
passion lady i have been too long the
vassal a pantoufle and the slave a
silver whistle you must find some other
to answer your call and let him be birth
and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn
 your menials and to call a church vassal
his master
 i have deserved this insult said the
lady colouring deeply for so long enduring
and fostering your petulance begone
sir leave this castle tonight i
will send you the means subsisting yourself
till you find some honest mode support
though i fear your imaginary grandeur
will be above all others save those 
rapine and violence begone sir and see
my face no more 
the page threw himself at her feet in
an agony sorrow my dear and honoured
mistress he said but was unable
to bring out another syllable
 arise sir said the lady and let go
i
i
the abbot 
my mantle hypocrisy is a poor cloak for
ingratitude
i am incapable either madam said
the page springing up with the exchange
 passion which belonged to his rapid and
impetuous temper think not i meant
to implore permission to reside here it
has been long my determination to leave
avenel and i will never forgive myself for
having permitted you to say the word hegone
j ere i said i leave you i did but
kneel to ask your forgiveness for an illconsidered
word used in the height displeasure
but which ill became my mouth as
addressed to you other grace i asked
not you have done much for me but i
repeat that you better know what you
yourself have done than what i have suffered

 roland said the lady somewhat appeased
and relenting towards her favourite
you had me to appeal to when you were
aggrieved you were neither called upon
 the abbot
to suffer wrong nor entitled to resent it
when you were under my protection
 and what said the youth if i sustained
wrong from those you loved and favoured
was i to disturb your peace with
idle talebearings and eternal complaints
no madam i have borne my own burthen
in silence and without disturbing you
with murmurs and the respect which you
accuse me wanting furnishes the only
reason why i have neither appealed to you
nor taken vengeance at my own hand in a
manner far more effectual it is well however
that we part i vas not born to be a
stipendiary favoured by his mistress until
ruined by the calumnies others may
heaven multiply its choicest blessings on
your honoured head and for your sake
upon all that are dear to you 
he was about to leave the apartment
when the lady called on him to return he
stood still while she thus addressed him 
 it was not my intention nor would it be
the abbot 
just even in the height my displeasure
to dismiss you without the means su
port take this purse gold
forgive me lady said the boy and
let me go hence with the consciousness
that i have not been degraded to the point
 accepting alms if my poor services
can be placed against the expense my
apparel and my maintenance i only remain
debtor to you for my life and that
alone is a debt which i can never repay 
put up then that purse and only say iiu
stead that you do not part from me m
anger
 no not in anger said the lady in
sorrow rather for your wilfulness but take
the gold you cannot but need it
may god evermore bless you for the
kind tone and the kind word but the oid
i cannot take i am able body and do
not lack friends so wholly as you may think 
for the time may come that i may yet shew
myself more thankful than by mere words
he threw himself on his knees kissed the
 the abbot
hand which she did not withdraw and
then hastily left the apartment
lilias for a moment or two kept her
eye fixed on her mistress who looked so
unusually pale that she seemed about to
faint but the lady instantly recovered herself
and declining the assistance which her
attendant offered her walked to her own
apartment
the abbot 
chapter 
lliou hast each secret the household francis
i dare be sworn thou hast been in the buttery
steeping thy curious humour in fat ale
and in the butler's tattle ay or chatting
with the glib waitingwoman o'er her comfits 
these bear the key to each domestic mystery
old play
upon the morrow succeeding the scene
we have described the disgraced favourite
left the castle and at breakfasttime the
cautious old steward and mrs lilias sate
in the apartment the latter personage
holding grave converse on the important
event the day sweetened by a small treat
 sweetmeats to which the providence 
mr wingate had added a little flask racy
canary
f
 the abbas
 he is gone at last said the abigail
sipping her glass and here is to his
good journey
amen answered the steward gravely
 i wish the poor deserted lad no ill
 and he is gone like a wildduck as he
came continued mrs lilias no lowering
 drawbridges or pacing along causeways
for him my master has pushed off
in the boat which they call the little herod
more shame to them for giving the name
 a christian to wood and iron and has
rowed himself by himself to the further side
 the loch and off and away with himself
and left all his finery strewed about his
room i wonder who is to clean his trumpery
out after him though the things are
worth lifting too
 doubtless mrs lilias answered the
master the household in the which
case i am free to think they will not long
cumber the floor
 and now tell me mr wingate continued
the damsel do not the very
the abbot 
cockles your heart rejoice at the house
being rid this upstart whelp that flung
us all into shadow 
why mrs lilias replied wingate
 as to rejoicing those who have lived as
long in great families as has been my lot
will be in no hurry to rejoice at any thing
and for roland grajtiie though he maybe
a good riddance in the main yet what
says the very sooth proverb seldom comes
a better 
seldom comes a better indeed echoed
mrs lilias i say never can come
a worse or one half so bad he might
have been the ruin our poor dear mistress
here she used her kerchief body
and soul and estate too for she spent more
coin on his apparel than on any four servants
about the house
 mrs lilias said the sage steward
 i do opine that our mistress requireth
not this pity at our hands being in all respects
competent to take care her own
body soul and estate into the bargain
 the abbot
you would not mayhap have said so
answered the waitingwoman had you
seen how like lot's wife she looked when
young master took his leave my mistress
is a good lady and a virtuous and a welldoing
lady and a wellspoken but i
would not sir halbert had seen her this
morning for two and a place
oh foy foy foy reiterated the
steward servants should hear and see
and say nothing besides that my lady is
utterly devoted to sir halbert as well she
may being as he is the most renowned
knight in these parts
 well well said the abigail i mean
no more harm but they that seek least renown
abroad are most apt to find quiet at
home that's all and my lady's lonesome
situation is to be considered that made her
fain to take up with the first beggar's brat
that a dog brought her out the loch
 and therefore said the steward i
say rejoice not too much or too hastily
mrs lilias for if your lady wished a favour
the abbot 
ite to pass away the time depend upon it
the time will not pass lighter now that he
is gone since she will have another favourite
to chuse for herself and be assured
she will not lack one
 and where should she chuse one but
among her own tried and faithful servants
said mrs lilias who have broken her
bread and drank her drink for so many
years i have known many a lady as high
as she that never thought either a friend
or favourite beyond their own waitingwoman
 always having a proper respect at
the same time for their old and faithful
master the household mr wingate
truly mrs lilias replied the steward
 i do partly see the mark at which
you shoot but i doubt your bolt will fall
short matters being with our lady as it
likes you to suppose it will neither be your
crimped pinners mrs lilias speaking 
them with due respect nor my silver hair
or golden chain that will fill up the void
which roland grme must needs leave in
 the abbot
our lady's leisure there will be a learned
young divine with some new doctrine a
learned leech with some new drug a bold
cavalier who will not be refused the favour
 wearing her colours at a running at the
ring a cunning harper that could harp the
heart out woman's breast as they say
signor david rizzio did to our poor queen
these are the sort folks who supply the
loss a wellfavoured favourite and not
an old steward or a middleaged waitingwoman

 well said lilias you have experience
master wingate and truly i would
my master would leave off his pricking hither
and thither and look better after the
affairs his household there will be a
papistrie among us next for what should
i see among master's clothes but a string 
gold beads i promise you aves and credos
both i seized on them like a falcon
 i doubt it not i doubt it not said the
steward sagaciously nodding his head i
have often noticed that the boy had strange
observances which savoured popery and
the abbot 
that he was very jealous to conceal them
but you will find the catholic under the
presbyterian cloak as often as the knave
under the friar's hood vhat then we are
all mortal right proper beads they are
he added looking attentively at them and
may weigh four ounces fine gold
 and i will have them melted down presently
she said before they be the misguiding
 some poor blinded soul
very cautious indeed mrs lilias said
the steward nodding his head in assent
i will have them made said mrs lilias
into a pair shoebuckles i would not
wear the pope's trinkets or whatever has
once borne the shape them one inch
above my instep were they diamonds instead
 gold but this is what has come
 father ambrose coming about the castle
as demure as a cat that is about to steal
cream
father ambrose is our master's brother
said the steward gravely
 very true master yvingate answered
 the abbot
the dame but is that a good reason why
he should pervert the king's liege subjects
to papistrie 
heaven forbid mrs lilias answered
the sententious majordomo but yet
there are worse folks than the papists
 i wonder where they are to be found
said the waitingwoman with some asperity
 but i believe mr wingate if one
were to speak to you about the devil himself
you would say there were worse people
than satan
 assuredly i might say so replied the
steward supposing that i saw satan standing
at my elbow
the waitingwoman started and having
exclaimed god bless us added i wonder
mr wingate you can take pleasure in
frightening one thus
nay mrs lilian i had no such purpose
was the reply but look you here
the papists are but put down for the present
but who knows how long this word
present will last there are two great pos

the abbot 
pish earls in the north england that
abominate the very word reformation i
mean the northumberland and westmoreland
earls men power enough to shake
any throne in christendom then though
our scottish king be god bless him a true
protestant yet here is his mother that was
our queen i trust there is no harm to say
god bless her too and she is a catholic 
and many begin to think she has had but
hard measure such as the hamiltons in the
west and some our border clans here
and the gordon in the north who are all
wishing to see a new world and if such a
new world should chance to come up it is
like that the queen will take back her own
crown and that the mass and the cross will
come up and then down go pulpits genevagowns
and black silk scullcaps
and have you mr jasper wingate
who have heard the word and listened unto
pure and precious mr henry warden have
you i say the patience to speak or but to
think popery coming down on us like a
 the abbot
storm or the woman mary again making
the royal seat scotland a throne abomination
 no marvel that you are so civil
to the cowled monk father ambrose when
he comes hither with his downcast eyes that
he never raises to my lady's face and with
his low sweettoned voice and his benedictines
and his bennisons and who so ready
to take them kindly as mr wingate 
mrs lilias replied the butler with an
air which was intended to close the debate
there are reasons for all things if i received
father ambrose debonair and suffered
him to steal a word now and then with
this same roland gramme it was not that i
cared a brass boodle for his benson or malison
either but only because i respected my
master's blood and who can answer if
mary come in again whether he may not be
as stout a tree to lean to as ever his brother
hath proved to us for down goes the earl
 murray when the queen comes by her
own again and good is his luck if he can
keep the head on his own shoulders and
down goes our knight with the earl his
the abbot 
patron j and who so like to mount into his
empty saddle as this same father ambrose 
the pope rome can soon dispense with
his vows and then we should have sir edward
the soldier instead ambrose the
priest
resentment and astonishment kept mrs
lilias silent while her old friend in his
self complacent manner was making known
to her his political speculations at length
her resentment found utterance in words
 great ire and scorn what master
wingate have you eaten my mistresses
bread to say nothing my master's so
many years that you could live to think 
her being dispossessed her own castle 
avenel by a wretched monk who is not a
drop's blood to her in the way relation 
i that am but a woman would try first
whether my rock or his covet were the better
metal shame on you master wingate
 if i had not held you as so old an acquaintance
this should have gone to my
lady's ears though i had been called 
the abbot
thank and taleyet for my pains as when
i told roland grseme shooting the wild
swan
master wingate was somewhat dismayed
at perceiving that the detail which he had
given his farsighted political views had
produced on his hearer rather suspicion 
his fidelity than admiration his wisdom
and endeavoured as hastily as possible to
apologize and to explain although internally
extremely offended at the unreasonable
view as he deemed it which it had
pleased mistress lilias bradbury to take
 his expressions and mentally convinced
that her disapprobation his sentiments
arose solely out the consideration
that though father ambrose supposing
him to become the master the castle
would certainly require the services a
steward yet those a waitingwoman
would in the supposed circumstances be
altogether superfluous
after his explanation had been received
as explanations usually are the two friends
the abbot 
separated lilias to attend the silver whistle
which called her to her mistress's chamber
and the sapient majordomo to the
duties his own department they parted
with less than their usual degree reverence
and regard for the steward felt that
his worldly wisdom was rebuked by the
more disinterested attachment the 
and mistress lilias bradbury
was compelled to consider her old friend
as something little if any thing better thana
timeserver

o poverty parts good company
old sot
while the departure the page afforded
subject for the conversation which we
have detailed in our last chapter the late
favourite was far advanced on his solitary
journey without well knowing what was
its object or what was likely to be its 
he had rowed the skiff in which he left the
castle to the side the lake most distant
from the village vvith the desire escaping
the notice the inhabitants his pride
whispered that he would be in his discarded
state only the subject their wonder
the abbot 
and compassion and his generosity told
him that any mark sympathy which his
situation should excite might be unfavourably
reported at the castle a trifling incident
convinced him he had little to fear
for his friends on the latter score he was
met by a young man some years older than
himself who had on former occasions been
but too happy to be permitted to share in
his sports in the subordinate character his
assistant ralph fisher approached to greet
him with all the alacrity an humble friend
 what master roland abroad on this
side and without either hawk or hound 
 hawk or hound said roland i will
never perhaps hollo to again i have been
dismissed that is i have left the castle
ralph was surprised what you are
to pass into the knight's service and take
the blackjack and the lance 
indeed replied roland graeme i
am not i am now leaving the service 
avenel for ever
 the abbot
 and whither are you going then said
the young peasant
 nay that is a question which it craves
time to answer i have that matter to determine
yet replied the disgraced favourite

 nay nay said ralph i warrant you
it is the same to you which way you go 
my lady would not dismiss you till she had
put some lining into the pouches your
doublet
sordid slave said roland graeme
doest thou think i would have accepted
a boon from one who was giving me over
a prey to detraction and to ruin at the instigation
 a canting priest and a meddling
serving woman the bread that i had
bought with such an alms would have choked
me at the first mouthful
ralph looked at his quondam friend with
an air wonder not unmixed with contempt
 well he said at length no
occasion for passion each man knows his
the abbot 
own stomach best but were i on a black
moor at this time day not knowing whither
i was going i would be glad to have
a broad piece or two in my pouch come
by them as i could but perhaps you will
go with me to my father's that is for a
night for tomorrow we expect my uncle
menelaus and all his folk but as i said for
one night 
the coldblooded limitation the offered
shelter to one night only and that tendered
most unwillingly offended the pride
 the discarded favourite
 i would rather sleep on the fresh heather
as i have done many a night on less
occasion said roland graeme than in
that smoky garret your father's that
smells peat smoke and usquebaugh like a
highlander's plaid
 you may chuse my master if you are
so nice replied ralph fisher you maybe
glad to smell a peatfire and usquebaugh
too if you journey long in the fashion you
propose you might have said godamercy
vol i g
 the abbot
for your proffer though it is not every one
will put themselves in the way illwill by
harbouring a discarded serving man
 ralph said roland graeme i would
pray you to remember that i have switched
you before now and this is the same
riding wand which you have tasted
ralph who was a thickset clownish figure
arrived at his full strength and conscious
 the most complete personal superiority
laughed contemptuously at the threats 
the slight made stripling
it may be the same wand he said
but not the same hand and that is as
good rhyme as if it were in a ballad look
you my lady's page that was when your
switch was up it was no fear you but
 your betters that kept mine down and
i wot not what hinders me from clearing
old scores with this hazel rung and shewing
you it was your lady's livery coat which
i spared and not your flesh and blood
master roland
in the midst his rage roland graeme
the abbot 
was just wise enough to see that by continuing
this altercation he would subject
himself to very rude treatment from the
boor who was so much older and stronger
than himself and while his antagonist with
a sort jeering laugh defiance seemed
to provoke the contest he felt the full bitterness
 his own degraded condition and
burst into a passion tears which he in
vain endeavoured to conceal with both his
hands
even the rough churl was moved with
the distress his quondam companion
 nay master roland he said i did
but as twere jest with thee i would not
harm thee man were it but for old acquaintance
sake but ever look to a man's
inches ere you talk switching why
thine arm man is but like a spindle compared
to mine but hark i hear old adam
woodcock hollowing to his hawk come
along man we will have a merry afternoon
and go jolly to my father's in spite the
peatsmoke and usquebaugh to boot maybe
we may put you into some honest way
 the abbot
 winning your bread though it's hard to
come by in these broken times
the unfortunate page made no answer
nor did he withdraw his hands from his face
and fisher continued in what he imagined
a suitable tone comfort
 why man when you were my lady's
minions men held you proud and some
thought you a papist and i wot not what
and so now that you have no one to bear
you out you must be companionable and
hearty and wait on the minister's examinations
and put these things out folk's
head and if he says you are in fault you
must jour your head to the stream and if
a gentleman or a gentleman's gentleman
gives you a rough word or a light blow
you must only say thank you for dusting
my doublet or the like as i have done
by you but hark to woodcock's whistle
again come and i will teach you all the
trick on't as we go on
 i thank you said roland graeme endeavouring
to assume an air indifference
and superiority j but i have another
the abbot 
path before me and were it otherwise 
could not tread in yours
 very true master roland replied the
clown and every man knows his own
matters best and so i will not keep you
from the path as you say give us a grip
 your hand man for auld lang syne 
what not clap palms ere we part well
so be it a wilful man will have his way 
and so farewell and the blessing the
morning to you
 goodmorrow goodmorrow said
roland hastily and the clown walked
lightly off whistling as he went and glad
apparently to be rid an acquaintance
whose claims might be troublesome and
who had no longer the means to be serviceable
to him
roland graeme compelled himself to walk
on while they were within sight each
other that his former inmate might not augur
any vacillation purpose or uncertainty
 object from his remaining on the
same spot j but the effort was a painful one
 the abbot
he seemed stunned as it were and giddy 
the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound
and quaking under his feet like
the surface a bog and he had once or
twice nearly fallen though the path he trod
was firm greensward he kept resolutely
moving forward in spite the internal
agitation to which these symptoms belonged
until the distant form his acquaintance
disappeared behind the slope 
a hill when his heart gave way at once 
and sitting down on the turf remote from
human ken he gave way to the natural expressions
 wounded pride grief and fear
and wept with unrestrained profusion and
unqualified bitterness
when the first violent paroxysm his
feelings had subsided the deserted and
friendless youth felt that mental relief which
usually follows such discharges sorrow
the tears continued to chase each other
down his cheeks but they were no longer
accompanied by the same sense desolation
j an afflicting yet milder sentiment was
the abbot 
awakened in his mind by the recollection
 his benefactress the unwearied kindness
which had attached her to him in spite
 many acts provoking petulance now
recollected as offences a deep dye which
had protected him against the machinations
 others as well as against the consequences
 his own folly and would have
continued to do so had not the excess 
his presumption compelled her to withdraw
her protection
whatever indignity i have borne he
said has been the just reward my own
ingratitude and have i done well to accept
the hospitality the more than maternal
kindness my protectress yet to detain
from her the knowledge my religion 
but she shall know that a catholic has as
much gratitude as a puritan that i have
been thoughtless but not wicked that in
my wildest moments i have loved respected
and honoured her and that the orphan
boy might indeed be heedless but was never
ungrateful
 the abbot
he turned as these thoughts passed
through his mind and began hastily to retread
his footsteps towards the castle but
he checked the first eagerness his repentant
haste when he reflected on the
scorn and contempt with which the family
were likely to see the return the fugitive
humbled as they must necessarily suppose
him into a supplicant who requested
pardon for his fault and permission to return
to his service he slackened his pace
but he stood not still
i care not he resolutely determined 
let them wink point nod sneer speak
 the conceit which is humbled the
pride which has had a fall i care not it
is a penance due to my folly and i will
endure it with patience but if she also
my benefactress if she also should think
me sordid and weakspirited enough to beg
not for her pardon alone but for a renewal
 the advantages which i derived from her
favour r suspicion my meanness i
cannot i will not brook
the abbot 
he stood still and his pride rallying with
constitutional obstinacy against his more
just feeling urged that he would incur the
scorn the lady avenel rather than
obtain her favour by following the course
which the first ardour his repentant feelings
had dictated to him
if i had but some plausible pretext
he thought some ostensible reason for
my return some reason to allege which
might shew i came not as a degraded supplicant
or a discarded menial i might go
thither but as i am i cannot my heart
would leap from its place and burst
as these thoughts passed through his
mind something passed in the air so near
him as to dazzle his eyes and almost to
brush the plume in his cap he looked up
it was the favourite falcon sir halbert
which flying around his head seemed to
claim his attention as that a wellknown
friend roland extended his arm and gave
the wellknown whoop and the falcon 

 the abbot
scanty settled on his wrist and began to
prune itself glancing at the youth from
time to time an acute and brilliant glance
 its hazel eye which seemed to ask why
he caressed it not with his usual fondness
ah diamond he said as if the bird
understood him thou and i must be strangers
henceforward many a gallant stoop
have i seen thee make and many a brave
heron strike down but that is all over and
there is no hawking more for me
 and why not master roland said
adam woodcock the falconer who came
at that instant from behind a few alder
bushes which had concealed him from view
why should there be no more hawking
for you why man what were our life
without our sports thou know'st the jolly
old song
and rather would allan in dungeon lie
than live at large where the falcon cannot fly 
and allan would rather lie in sexton's pound
than live where he follow'd not the merry hawk and
hound
the abbot 
the voice the honest falconer was
hearty and friendly and the tone in which
he half sung half recited his rude ballad
implied honest frankness and cordiality
but remembrance their quarrel and its
consequences embarrassed roland and prevented
his reply the falconer saw his hesitation
and guessed the cause
what now said he master roland 
do you who are half an englishman think
that i who am a whole one would keep up
anger at you and you in distress that
were like some the scots my master's
reverence always excepted who can be
fair and false and wait their time and keep
their mind as they say to themselves and
touch pot and flagon with you and hunt
and hawk with you and after all when time
serves pay off some old feud with the point
 the dagger canny yorkshire has no
memory for such old sores why man an
you had hit me a rough blow maybe i
would rather have taken it from you thana
rough word from another j for you have a
 the abbot
good notion falconry though you stand
up for washing the meat for the classes
so give us your hand man and bear no
malice
roland though he felt his proud blood
rebel at the familiarity honest adam's
address could not resist its downright frankness
covering his face with the one hand
he held out the other to the falconer and
returned with readiness his friendly grasp
why this is hearty now said woodcock
 i always said you had a kind heart
though you have a spice the devil in
your disposition that is certain i came
this way with the falcon on purpose to find
you and yon halfbred hubbard told me
which way you took flight you ever
thought too much that kestrelkite master
roland and he knows nought sport
after all but what he caught from you i
saw how it had been betwixt you and i
sent him out my company with a wanton
i would rather have a rifler on my perch
than a false knave at my elbow and now
the abbot 
master roland tell me what way wing
ye 
 that is as god pleases replied the
page with a sigh which he could not suppress

 nay man never droop a feather for
being cast off said the falconer who
knows but you may soar the better and
fairer flight for all this yet look at diamond
there tis a noble bird and shews
gallantly with his hood and bells and jesses 
but there is many a wild falcon in norway
that would not change properties with him
 and that is what i would say you
you are no longer my lady's page and you
will not clothe so fair or feed so well or
sleep so soft or shew so gallant what 
all that if you are not her page you are
your own man and may go where you will
without minding whoop or whistle the
worst is the loss the sport but who knows
what you may come to they say that sir
halbert himself i speak with reverence
was once glad to be the abbot's forester
 the abbot
and now he has hounds and hawks his
own and adam woodcock for a falconer
to the boot
 you are right and say well adam
answered the youth the blood mantling in
his cheeks the falcon will soar higher
without his bells than with them though
the bells be made silver
that is cheerily spoken answered the
falconer and whither now 
 i thought going to the abbey 
kennaquhair answered roland grme
 to ask the counsel father ambrose
 and joy go with you said the falconer
 though it is like you may find the
old monks in some sorrow they say the
commons are threatening to turn them out
 their cells and make a devil's mass it
in the old church thinking they have forborne
that sport too long and troth i am
clear the same opinion
 then will father ambrose be the better
 having a friend beside him said the
page manfully
ay but my young fearnought rethe
abbot 
plied the falconer the friend will scarce
be the better being beside father ambrose
 he may come by the redder's lick
and that is ever the worst the battle
i care not for that said the page the
dread a lick should not hold me back 
but i fear i may bring trouble between the
brothers by visiting father ambrose i
will tarry tonight at saint cuthbert's cell
where the old priest will give me a night's
shelter and i will send to father ambrose
to ask his advice before i go down to the
convent
 by our lady said the falconer and
that is a likely plan and now he continued
exchanging his frankness manner
for a sort awkward embarrassment as if
he had somewhat to say that he had no
ready means to bring out and now you
wot well that i wear a pouch for my hawks
 meat and so forth but wot you what it is
lined with master roland 
with leather to be sure replied roland
somewhat surprised at the hesitation
 the abbot
with which adam woodcock asked a question
so simple
with leather lad said woodcock 
 ay and with silver to the boot that
see here he said shewing a secret slit in
the lining his bag office here they
are thirty good harry groats as ever were
struck in bluff old hall's time and ten 
them are right heartily at your service and
now the murder is out
roland's first idea was to refuse this assistance
 but he recollected the vows humility
which he had just taken upon him
and it occurred that this was the opportunity
to put his newformed resolution to
the test assuming a strong command 
himself he answered adam woodcock with
as much frankness as his nature permitted
him to wear in doing what was so contrary
to his inclinations that he accepted
thankfully his kind offer while to sooth
his own reviving pride he could not help
adding he hoped soon to requite the
obligation
the abbot ll
 that as you list that as you list
young man said the falconer with glee
counting out and delivering to his young
friend the supply he had so generously offered
and then adding with great chearfulness
 now you may go through the
world for he that can back a horse wind a
horn hollow a greyhound fly a hawk and
play at sword and buckler with a whole
pair shoes a green jacket and ten lilywhite
groats in his pouch may bid father
care hang himself in his own jesses farewell
and god be with you
so saying and as if desirous to avoid the
thanks his companion he turned hastily
round and left roland greene to pursue
his journey alone
 the abbot
chapter viii
the sacred tapers lights are gone
grey moss has clad the altar stone
the holy image is o'erthrown
the bell has ceased to toll
the long ribb'd aisles are burst and sunk
the holy shrines to ruin sunk
departed is the pious monk
god's blessing on his soul
rediviva
the cell saint cuthbert as it was
called marked or was supposed to mark
one those restingplaces which that venerable
saint was pleased to assign to his
monks when his convent being driven
from lindisfarne by the danes became a
peripatetic society religionists and bearing
their patron's body on their shoulders
transported him from place to place through
scotland and the borders england until
he was pleased at length to spare them
the abbot 
the pain bearing him farther and to
chuse his ultimate place rest in the lordly
towers durham the odour his
sanctity remained behind him at each place
where he had granted the monks a transient
respite from their labours and proud
were those who could assign as his temporary
restingplace any spot within their vicinity
few were more celebrated and honoured
than the wellknown cell saint
cuthbert to which roland graeme now
bent his way situated considerably to the
northwest the great abbey kenna
quhair on which it was dependent in the
neighbourhood were some those recommendations
which weighed with the experienced
priesthood rome in chusing
their sites for places religion
there was a well possessed some medicinal
qualities which course claimed
the saint for its guardian and patron and
occasionally produced some advantage to
the recluse who inhabited his cell since
 the abbot
none could reasonably be expected to be
benefited by the fountain who did not extend
their bounty to the saint's chaplain
a few roods fertile land afforded the
monk his plot garden ground an eminence
well clothed with trees rose behind
the cell and sheltered it from the north
and the east while the front opening to
the southwest looked up a wild but pleasant
valley down which wandered a lively
brook which battled with every stone
that interrupted its passage
the cell itself was rather plainly that
rudely built a low gothic building with
two small apartments one which served
the priest for his dwellingplace the other
for his chapel as there were few the
secular clergy who durst venture to reside
so near the border the assistance this
monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless
to the community while the catholic
religion retained the ascendancy as he
could marry christen and administer the
the abbot 
other sacraments the roman church 
late however as the protestant doctrines
gained ground he had found it convenient
to live in close retirement and to avoid as
much as possible drawing upon himself
observation or animadversion the appearance
 his habitation however when roland
graeme came before it in the close 
the evening plainly shewed that his caution
had been finally ineffectual
the page's first movement was to knock
at the door when he observed to his surprise
that it was open not from being left
unlatched but because beat off its upper
hinge it was only fastened to the doorpost
by the lower and could therefore no longer
perform its functions somewhat alarmed
at this and receiving no answer when
he knocked and called roland began to
look more at leisure upon the exterior 
the little dwellings before he ventured to
enter it the flowers which had been
trained with care against the walls seemed
to have been recently torn down and 
the abbot
ed their dishonoured garlands on the earth 
the latticed window was broken and dashed
in the garden which the monk had
maintained by his constant labour in the
highest order and beauty bore marks 
having been lately trod down and destroyed
by the hoofs animals and the feet 
men
the sainted spring had not escaped it
was wont to arise beneath a canopy ribbed
arches with which the devotion elder
times had secured and protected its healing
waters these arches were now almost
entirely demolished and the stones
 which they were built were tumbled into
the well as if with the purpose choking
up and destroying the fountain which as it
had shared in other days the honour the
saint was in the present doomed to partake
his unpopularity part the roof had
been pulled down from the house itself
and an attempt had been made with crows
and levers upon one the angles by
which several large cornerstones had been
the abbot 
forced out their place but the solidity
 ancient masonwork had proved too
great for the time or patience the assailants
and they had relinquished their task
 destruction such dilapidated buildings
after the lapse years during which nature
has gradually covered the effects violence
with creeping plants and with weather
stains exhibit amid their decay a melancholy
beauty but when the visible effects
 violence appear raw and recent
there is no feeling to mitigate the sense 
devastation with which they impress the
spectators and such was now the scene
on which the youthful page gazed with the
painful feelings it was qualified to excite
when his first momentary surprise was
over roland grseme was at no loss to conjecture
the cause these ravages the
destruction the popish edifices did not
take place at once throughout scotland but
at different times and according to the spirit
which actuated the reformed clergy 
some whom instigated their hearers to
s the abbot
these acts demolition and others with
better taste and feeling endeavoured to protect
the ancient shrines while they desired
to see them purified from the objects which
had attracted idolatrous devotion from
time to time therefore the populace the
scottish towns and villages when instigated
either by their own feelings abhorrence
for popish superstition or by the zealous
doctrines the more zealous preachers
resumed the work destruction and exercised
it upon some sequestered church
chapel or cell which had escaped the
first burst their indignation against the
religion rome in many places the vices
 the catholic clergy arising out the
wealth and the corruption that tremendous
hierarchy furnished too good an apology
for wreaking vengeance upon the
splendid edifices which they inhabited and
 this an old scottish historian gives a remarkable
instance
 t i u 
 the abbot
lady avenel said the page as thy
look and words seem to imply i have eaten
her bread i have experienced her favour
i will neither injure nor betray her
 that hereafter my son said she 
but learn this that it is not for thee to
capitulate in thy duty and to say this will
i do and that will i leave undone no
roland god and man vill no longer abide
the wickedness this generation seest
thou these fragments knowest thou what
they represent and canst thou think it is
for thee to make distinctions amongst a
race so cursed by heaven that they renounce
violate blaspheme and destroy
whatsoever we are commanded to believe
in whatsoever we are commanded to reverence

asshe spoke she bent her head towards
the broken image with a countenance in
which strong resentment and zeal were
mingled with an expression ecstatic devotion
 she raised her left hand aloft as in
the act making a vow and thus proceedthe
abbot 
ed bear witness for me holy saint within
whose violated temple we stand that as
it is not for vengeance my own that my
hate pursues these people so neither for
any favour or earthly affection towards any
amongst them will i withdraw my hand
from the plough when it shall pass over
the devoted furrow bear witness holy
saint once thyself a wanderer and fugitive
as we are now bear witness mother 
mercy queen heaven bear witness
saints and angels 
in this high strain enthusiasm she
stood raising her eyes through the fractured
roof the vault to the stars which
now began to twinkle through the pale twilight
while the long grey tresses which
hung down over her shoulders waved in the
jaightbreeze which the chasm and fractured
windows admitted freely
roland graeme was too much awed by
early habits as well as by the mysterious
import her words to ask for further explanation
 the purpose she obscurely hint
h 
 the abbot
ed at nor did she farther press him on the
subject j for having concluded her prayer
or obtestation by clasping her hands together
with solemnity and then signing
herself with the cross she again addressed
her grandson in a tone more adapted to
the ordinary business life
 thou must hence she said roland
thou must hence lout not till morning 
and now how wilt thou shift for thy night's
quarters thou hast been more softly bred
than when we were companions in the
misty hills cumberland and lauderdale

 i have at least preserved my good mother
the habits which i then learned can
lie hard and think it no hardship since
 have been a wanderer i have been a hunter
and fisher and fowler and each these
is accustomed to sleep freely in a worse shelter
than sacrilege has left us here
 than sacrilege has left us here said
the matron repeating his words and pausing
on them most true my son and
the abbot 
god's faithful children are now worst sheltered
when they lodge in god's own house
and the demesne his blessed saints we
shall sleep cold here under the night wind
which whistles through the breaches which
heresy has made they shall lie warmer
who made them ay and through a long
hereafter
notwithstanding the wild and singular
expressions this female she seemed to
retain towards roland graeme in a strong
degree that affectionate and sedulous love
which women bear to their nurslings and
the children dependent on their care it
seemed as if she would not permit him todo
aught for himself which in former days
her attention had been used to do for him
and that she considered the tall stripling
before her as being equally dependent on
her careful attention as when he was the
orphan child who had owed all to her affectionate
solicitude
what hast thou to eat now she said
as leaving the chapel they went into the
 the abbot
deserted habitation the priest or what
means kindling a fire to defend thee
from this raw and inclement air poor
child thou hast made slight provision fora
long journey nor hast thou skill to help
thyself by wit when means are scanty but
our lady has placed by thy side one to
whom want in all its forms is as familiar as
plenty and splendour have formerly been
and with want roland come the arts 
which she is the inventor
with an active and officious diligence
which strangely contrasted with her late
abstracted and high tone catholic devotion
she set about her domestic arrangements
for the evening a pouch which
was hidden under her garment produced
a flint and steel and from the scattered
fragments around those pertaining to the
image saint cuthbert scrupulously excepted
she obtained splinters sufficient to
raise a sparkling and cheerful fire on the
hearth the deserted cell
and now she said for needful food
the abbot 
think not it mother said roland
 unless you yourself feel hunger it is a
little thing for me to endure a night's abstinence
and a small atonement for the necessary
transgression the rules the
church upon which i was compelled during
my stay in the castle
hunger for myself answered the matron
 know youth that a mother knows
not hunger till that her child is satisfied
and with affectionate inconsistence totally
different from her usual manner she added
 roland you must not fast you have
dispensation you are young and to youth
food and sleep are necessaries not to be
dispensed with husband your strength
my child your sovereign your religion
your country require it let age macerate
by fast and vigil a body which can only
suffer j let youth in these active times
nourish the limbs and the strength which
action requires
while she thus spoke the scrip which
had produced the means striking fire
 the abbot
furnished provision for a meal which she
herself scarce partook but anxiously watched
her charge taking a pleasure resembling
that an epicure in each morsel
which he swallowed with a youthful appetite
which abstinence had rendered unusually
sharp roland readily obeyed her
recommendations and eat the food which
she so affectionately and earnestly placed
before him but she shook her head when
invited by him in return to partake the
refreshment her own cares had furnished 
and when his solicitude became more pressing
she refused him in a loftier tone rejection

young man she said you know
not to whom or what you speak they
to whom heaven declares its purpose must
merit its communication by mortifying the
senses they have that within which requires
not the superfluity earthly nutriment
which is necessary to those who
are without the sphere the vision to
them the watch spent in prayer is a rethe
abbot 
pressing slumber and the sense doing
the will heaven is a richer banquet than
the tables monarchs can spread before
them but do thou sleep soft my son
she said relapsing from the tone fanaticism
into that maternal affection and
tenderness j do thou sleep sound while
life is but young with thee and the cares
 the day can be drowned in the slumbers
 the evening different is thy duty and
mine and as different the means by which
we must qualify and strengthen ourselves
to perform it from thee is demanded
strength body from me strength 
soul
when she thus spoke she prepared with
ready address a palletcouch composed
partly the dried leaves which had once
furnished a bed to the solitary and the
guests who occasionally received his hospitality
and which neglected by the destroyers
 his humble cell had remained
little disturbed in the corner allotted for
them to these her care added some 
n
 the abbot
the vestures which lay torn and scattered
on the floor with a zealous hand she selected
all such as appeared to have made
any part the sacerdotal vestments laying
them aside as sacred from ordinary purposes
and with the rest she made with
dexterous promptness such a bed as a
weary man might willingly stretch himself
on j and during the time she was preparing
it rejected even with acrimony any attempt
which the youth made to assist her
or any entreaty which he urged that she
would accept the place rest for her
own use sleep thou said she roland
graeme sleep thou the persecuted
the disinherited orphan the son an illfated
mother sleep thou i go to pray in
the chapel beside thee
the manner was too enthusiastically earnest
too obstinately firm to permit roland
graeme to dispute her will any further yet
he felt some shame in giving way to it it
seemed as if she had forgotten the years
that had passed away since their meeting j
 
the abbot 
and expected to meet in the tall indulged
and wilful youth whom she had recovered
the passive obedience the child whom
she had left in the castle avenel this
did not fail to hurt her grandson's characteristic
and constitutional pride he obeyed
indeed awed into submission by the
sudden recurrence former subordination
and by feelings affection and gratitude
still however he felt the yoke
 have i relinquished the hawk and the
hound he said to become the pupil 
her pleasure as if i were still a child i
whom even my envious mates allowed to
be superior in those exercises which they
took most pains to acquire and which came
to me naturally as if a knowledge them
had been my birthright this may not and
must not be i will be no reclaimed 
who is carried hooded on a woman's
wrist and has his quarry only shewn
to him when his eyes are uncovered for his
flight i will know her purpose ere it is
proposed to me to aid it
 the abbot
these and other thoughts streamed
through the mind roland graeme and
although wearied with the fatigues the
day it was long ere he could compose himself
to rest
the abbot 
chapter 
kneel with me swear it tis not in words i trust
save when they're fenced with an appeal to heaven
old flay
after passing the night in that sound
sleep for which agitation and fatigue had
prepared him roland was awakened by
the fresh morning air and by the beams
 the rising sun his first feeling was
that surprise for instead looking
forth from a turret window on the waters
 the lake avenel which was the prospect
his former apartment afforded an
latticed aperture gave him the view 
the demolished garden the banished
anchorite he sate up on his couch 
leaves and arranged in his memory not
 the abbot
without surprise the singular events the
preceding day which appeared the more surprising
the more he considered them he
had lost the protectress his youth and
in the same day he had recovered the
guide and guardian his childhood the
former deprivation he felt ought to be matter
 unceasing regret and it seemed as if
the latter could hardly be the subject 
unmixed self congratulation he remembered
this person who had stood to him in
the relation a mother as equally affectionate
in her attention and absolute in
her authority a singular mixture love
and fear attended upon his early remembrances
as they were connected with her 
and the fear that she might desire to resume
the same absolute controul over his
motions a fear which her conduct yesterday
did not tend much to dissipate
weighed heavily against the joy this second
meeting
 she cannot mean said his rising pride
to lead and direct me as a pupil when i
the abbot 
am at the age judging my own actions
 this she cannot mean or meaning
it will feel herself strangely deceived
a sense gratitude towards the person
against whom his heart thus rebelled checked
his course feeling he resisted the
thoughts which involuntarily arose in his
mind as he would have resisted an actual
instigation the foul fiend and to aid
him in his struggles he felt for his beads
but in his hasty departure from the castle
 avenel he had forgotten and left them
behind him
 this is yet worse he said but two
things i learned her under the most
deadly charge secrecy to tell my beads
and to conceal that i did so and i have
kept my word till now and when she shall
ask me for the rosary i must say i have
forgotten it do i deserve she should believe
me when i say i have kept the secret
 my faith when i set so light by its symbol

 the abbot
he paced the floor in anxious agitation
in fact his attachment to his faith was 
a nature very different from that which animated
the enthusiastic matron but which
notwithstanding it would have been his last
thought to relinquish
the early charges impressed on him by
his grandmother had been instilled into a
mind and memory a character peculiarly
tenacious child as he was he was proud
 the confidence reposed in his discretion
and resolved to shew that it had not been
rashly entrusted to him at the same time
his resolution was no more than that a
child and must necessarily have gradually
faded away under the operation both
 precept and example during his residence
at the castle avenel but for the
exhortations father ambrose who in
his lay state had been called edward glendining
this zealous monk had been apprized
by an unsigned letter placed in his
hand by a pilgrim that a child educated in
the abbot 
the catholic faith was now in the castle 
avenel perilously situated so was the
scroll expressed as ever the three children
who were cast into the fiery furnace persecution
the letter threw upon father
ambrose the fault should this solitary
lamb unwillingly left within the demesnes
 the prowling wolf become his final prey
there needed no farther exhortation to
the monk than the idea that a soul might
be endangered and that a catholic might
become an apostate and he made his visits
more frequent than usual to the castle
 avenel lest through want the private
encouragement and instruction which
he always found some opportunity dispensing
the church should lose a proselyte
and according to the romish creed
the devil acquire a soul
still these interviews were rare and
though they encouraged the solitary boy
to keep his secret and hold fast his religion
they were neither frequent nor long enough
to inspire him with any thing beyond a
 the abbot
blind attachment to the observances which
the priest recommended he adhered to
the forms his religion rather because he
felt it would be dishonourable to change
that his fathers than from any rational
or sincere belief its mysterious doctrines
it was a principal part the distinction
which in his own opinion singled him out
from those with whom he lived and gave
him an additional though an internal and
concealed reason for contemning those 
the household who shewed an undisguised
dislike him and for hardening himself
against the instructions the chaplain
henry warden
the fanatic preacher he thought
within himself during some one the
chaplain's frequent discourses against the
church rome he little knows whose
ears are receiving his profane doctrine and
with what contempt and abhorrence they
hear his blasphemies against the holy religion
by which kings have been crowned
and for which martyrs have died
the abbot 
but in such proud feelings defiance
 heresy as it was termed and its professors
which associated the catholic religion
with a sense generous independence
and that the protestants with the
subjugation his mind and temper to the
direction mr warden began and ended
the faith roland gramme who independently
 the pride singularity
sought not to understand and had no one
to expound to him the peculiarities the
tenets which he professed his regret
therefore at missing the rosary which had
been conveyed to him through the hands
 father ambrose was rather the shame
 a soldier who has dropped his cockade
or badge service than that a religionist
who had forgotten a visible symbol 
his religion
his thoughts on the subject however
were mortifying and the more so from apprehension
that his negligence must reach
the ears his relative he felt it could
vol i i
f the abbor
be no one but her who had secretly transmitted
these beads to father ambrose for
his use and that his carelessness was but
an indifferent requital her kindness
nor will she omit to ask me about them
said he to himself for her's is a zeal which
age cannot quell and if she has not quitted
her wont my answer will not fail to incense
her
while he thus communed with himself
magdalen graeme entered the apartment
the blessing the morning on your
youthful head my son she said with a
solemnity expression which thrilled the
youth to the heart so sad and earnest did
the benediction flow from her lips in a tone
where devotion was blended with affection
and thou hast started thus early from thy
couch to catch the first breath the dawn
but it is not well my roland enjoy slumber
while thou canst the time is not far
behind when the waking eye must be thy
portion as well as mine
the abbot 
she littered these words with an affectionate
and anxious tone which shewed
that devotional as were the habitual exercises
 her minds the thoughts her nursling
yet bound her to earth with the cords
 human affection and passion
but she abode not long in a mood which
she probably regarded as a momentary dereliction
 her imaginary high calling 
 come she said youth up and be doing
 it is time that we leave this place
and whither do we go said the young
man or what is the object our journey
r
the matron stepped back and gazed on
him with surprise not unmingled with displeasure

to what purpose such a question she
said is it not enough that i lead the
way hast thou lived with heretics till
thou hast learned to instal the vanity 
thine own private judgment in place 
due honour and obedience 
 the abbot
the time thought roland graeme within
himself is already come when i must
establish my freedom or be a willing thrall
for ever i feel that i must speedily look
to it
she instantly fulfilled his foreboding by
recurring to the theme by which her
thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed
although when she pleased no one
could so perfectly disguise her religion
thy beads my son hast thou told thy
beads 
koland graeme coloured high he felt
the storm was approaching but scorned to
avert it by a falsehood
i have forgot my rosary at the castle
 avenel
 forgot thy rosary exclaimed she 
false both to religion and to natural duty
hast thou lost what was sent so far and at
such risk a token the truest affection
that should have been every bead it as
dear to thee as thine eyebails i
i
the abbot 
 i am grieved it should have so chanced
mother said the youth and much did i
value the token as coming from you for
what remains i trust to win gold enough
when i push my way in the world and till
then beads black oak or a rosary nuts
must serve the turn
 hear him said his grandmother 
 young as he is he hath learned already
the lessons the devil's school the rosary
consecrated by the holy father himself
and sanctified by his blessings is buta
few knobs gold whose value may be
replaced by the wages his profane labour
and whose virtue may be supplied by a
string hazel nuts this is heresy so
henry warden the wolf who ravages the
flock the shepherd hath taught thee to
speak and to think
 mother said roland graeme am
no heretic i believe and i pray according
to the rules our church this misfortune
i regret but i cannot amend it
 the abbot
 thou canst repent it though replied
his spiritual directress repent it in dust
and ashes atone for it by fasting prayer
and penance instead looking on me with
a countenance as light as if thou hadst lost
but a button from thy cap
 mother said roland be appeased 
i will remember my fault in the next 
confession which i have space and oppor 
tunitv to make and will do whatsoever the
priest requires me in atonement for
the heaviest fault i can do no more but
mother he added after a moment's pause
 let me not incur your farther displeasure
if i ask whither our journey is bound and
what is its object i am no longer a child
but a man and at my own disposal with 
down upon my chin and a sword by my
side i will go to the the world with
you to do your pleasure but i owe it to
myself to enquire the purpose and direction
 our travels
you owe it to yourself ungrateful boy 
the abbot 
replied his relative passion rapidly supplying
the colour which age had long chased
from her features to yourself you owe
nothing you can owe nothing to me you
owe every thing your life when an infant
your support while a child the means
 instruction and the hopes honour 
and sooner than thou shouldst abandon the
noble cause to which i have devoted thee
would i see thee lie a corpse at my feet
roland was alarmed at the vehement agitation
with which she spoke and which
threatened to overpower her aged frame 
and he hastened to reply i forget nothing
 what owe to you my dearest
mother shew me how my blood can testify
my gratitude and you shall judge if i
spare it but blindfold obedience has in it
as little merit as reason
 saints and angels replied magdalen
and do i hear these words from the child
 my hopes the nursling by whose bed i
have kneeled and for whose weal i have
wearied every saint in heaven with prayers 
 the abbot
roland by obedience only canst thou shew
thy affection and thy gratitude what avails
itthatyoumight perchance adopt recourse
i propose to thee were it to be fully explained
 thou wouldst not then follow
my command but thine own judgment 
thou wouldst not do the will heaven
communicated through thy best friend to
whom thou west thine all but thou wouldst
observe the blinded dictates thine own
imperfect reason hear me roland a lot
calls thee solicits thee demands thee 
the proudest to which man can be destined
and it uses the voice thine earliest thy
best thy only friend wilt thou resist it 
then go thy way leave me here my hopes
on earth are gone and withered i will
kneel me down before yonder profaned altar
and when the raging heretics return
they shall dye it with the blood a martyr

but my dearest mother said roland
grseme whose early recollections her
violence were formidably renewed by these
the abbot 
wild expressions reckless passion i
will not forsake you i will abide with you
worlds shall not force me from your side
i will protect i will defend you i will
live with you and die for you
 one word my son were worth all these
say only i will obey you
doubt it not mother replied the
youth i will and that with all my heart 
only
nay i receive no qualifications thy
promise said magdalen graeme catching
at the word the obedience which i require
is absolute and blessing on thee thou
darling memory my beloved child that
thou hast power to make a promise so hard
to human pride trust me well that in
the design in which thou doest embark
thou hast for thy partners the mighty and
the valiant the power the church and
the pride the noble succeed or fail
live or die thy name shall be among those
with whom success or failure is alike glow

 the abbot
rioiis death or life alike desirous forward
then forward ife is short and our plan
is laborious angels saints and the whole
blessed host heaven have their eyes even
now on this barren and blighted land 
scotland what say i on scotland their
eye is on isj roland on the frail woman
on the inexperienced youth who amidst
the ruins which sacrilege hath made in the
holy place devote themselves to god's
cause and that their lawful sovereign
amen so be it the blessed eyes saints
and martyrs vhich see our resolve shall
witness the execution or their ears which
hear our vow shall hear our deathgroan
drawn in the sacred cause
while thus speaking she held roland
greene firmly ith one hand while she
pointed upward with the other to leave
him as it were no means protest against
the obtestation to which he vas thus made
a party alien she had finished her appeal
to heaven she left him no leisure for farther
hesitation or for asking any explana
the abbot 
tion her purpose but passing with the
same ready transition as formerly to the solicitous
attentions an anxious parent
overwhelmed him with questions concerning
his residence in the castel avenel
and the qualities and accomplishments he
had acquired
 it is well she said when she had exhausted
her enquiries my gay goeshawk
hath been well trained and will soar high 
but those who bred him will have cause
to fear as well as to wonder at his flight let
us now she said to our morning meal
and care not though it be a scanty one a
few hours walk will bring us to more friendly
quarters
they broke their fast accordingly on
such fragments as remained their yesterday's
provision and immediately set out on
their farther journey magdalen gramme led
the way with a firm and active step much
beyond her years and roland grahame followed
pensive and anxious and far from

and very few to love
wordsworth
in the course their journey the travellers
spoke little to each other magdalen
graeme chaunted from time to time ina
low voice a part some one those
beautiful old latin hymns which belong to
the catholic service muttered an ave or a
credo and so passed on lost in devotional
contemplation the meditations her
grandson were more bent on mundane matters
 and many a time as a moorfovvl arose
from the heath and shot along the moor uttering
his bold crow defiance he thought
 the jolly adam woodcock and his trusty
 the abbot
goeshawk or as they passed a thicket
where the low trees and bushes were intermingled
with tall fern furze and broom so
as to form a thick and intricate cover his
dreams were a roebuck and a brace 
gazehounds but frequently his mind returned
to the benevolent and kind mistress
whom he had left behind him offended justly
and unreconciled by any effort his
my step would be lighter he thought
and so would my heart could i but have
returned to see her for one instant and to
say lady the orphanboy was wild but not
ungrateful
traveling in these divers moods about
the hour noon they reached a small
straggling village in which as usual were
seen one or two those predominating
towers or peelhouses which for reasons
 defence elsewhere detailed were at that
time to be found in every border hamlet
a brook flowed beside the village and watered
the valley in which it stood there
was also a mansion at the the village
the abbot 
and a little way separated from it much
dilapidated and in very bad order but appearing
to have been the abode persons
 some consideration the situation was
agreeable being an angle formed by the
stream bearing three or four large sycamore
trees which being in full leaf served
to relieve the dark appearance the mansion
which was built a deep red stone
the house itself had been a large one but
was now obviously too big for the inmates 
several windows were built up especially
those which opened from the lower storey 
others were blockaded in a less substantial
manner the court before the door which
had once been defended with a species 
low outer wall now ruinous was paved
but the stones were completely covered
with long grey nettles thistles and other
weeds which shooting up betwixt the flags
had displaced many them from their
level even matters demanding more peremptory
attention had been left neglected
 the abbot
in a manner vhich argued sloth or poverty
in the extreme the stream undermining
a part the bank near an angle the ruinous
wall had brought it down with a corner
turret the ruins which lay in the bed
 the river the current interrupted by
the ruins which it had overthrown and
turned yet nearer to the site the tower
had greatly enlarged the breach it had
made and was in the process undermining
the ground on which the house itself
stood unless it were speedily protected by
sufficient bulwarks
all this attracted roland graeme's observation
as they approached the dwelling by
a winding path which gave them at intervals
a view it from different points
if we go to yonder house he said to
his mother i trust it is but for a short visit
it looks as if two rainy days from the
northwest would send the whole into the
brook
you see but with the eyes the body
the abbot 
said the old woman god will defend
his own though it be forsaken and despised
 men better to dwell on the sand
under his law than fly to the rock human
trust
as she thus spoke they entered the
court before the old mansion and roland
could observe that the front it had formerly
been considerably ornamented with
carved work in the same darkcoloured
freestone which it was built but all
these ornaments had been broken down
and destroyed and only the shattered vestiges
 niches and entablatures now strewed
the place which they had once occupied
the larger entrance in front was walled up
but a little footpath which from its appearance
seemed to be rarely trodden led
to a small wicket defended by a door well
clenched with ironheaded nails at which
magdalen grme knocked three times
pausing betwixt each knock until she heard
an answering tap from within at the last
knock the wicket was opened by a pale
 the abbor
thin female who said benedicite qui ver i
nient in nomine domini they entered
and the portress hastily shut behind them
the wicket and made fast the massive fastenings
by which it was secured
the female led the way through a narrow
entrance into a vestibule some extent
paved with stone and having benches
 the same solid material ranged around
at the upper was an oriel window but
part the intervals formed by the stone
shafts and mullions was blocked up so that
the apartment was very gloomy
here they stopped and the mistress 
the mansion for such she was embraced
magdalen graeme and greeting her by the
title sister kissed her with much solemnity
on either side the face
the blessing our lady be upon you
my sister were her next words and they
left no doubt upon roland's mind respecting
the religion their hostess even if
he could have suspected his venerable and
zealous guide resting elsewhere than in
the abbot f
the habitation an orthodox catholic
they spoke together a few words in private
during which he had leisure to remark
more particularly the appearance 
his grandmother's friend
her age might be betwixt fifty and sixty 
her looks had a mixture melancholy and
unhappiness that bordered on discontent
and obscured the remains beauty which
age had still left on her features her
dress was the plainest and most ordinary
sort a dark colour and like magdalen
greene's something approaching to a religious
habit strict neatness and cleanliness
 person seemed to intimate that if poor
she was not reduced to squalid or heartbroken
distress and that she was still sufficiently
attached to life to retain a taste for its
decencies if not its elegancies her manner
as well as her features and appearance argued
an original condition and education
far above the meanness her present appearance
la short the whole figure was
such as to excite the idea that female
 the abbot
must have had a history worth knowing
while roland grasme was making this very
reflection the whispers the two females
ceased and the mistress the mansion
approaching him looked on his face and
person with much attention and as it seemed
some interest
 this then she said addressing his
relative is the child thine unhappy
daughter magdalen and him the only
shoot from your ancient tree you are willing
to devote to the good cause
yes by the rood answered magdalen
graeme in her usual tone resolved determination
 to the good cause i devote him
flesh and fell sinew and limb body and
soul
 thou art a happy woman sister magdalen
answered her companion that
lifted so high above human affection and
human feeling thou canst bind such a victim
to the horns the altar had i been
called to make such sacrifice to plunge a
youth so young and fair into the plots and
the abbot 
bloodthirsty dealings the time not the
patriarch abraham when he led isaac up
the mountain would have rendered more
melancholy obedience
she then continued to look at roland
with a mournful aspect compassion
until the intentness her gaze occasioned
his colour to rise and he was about to move
out its influence when he was stopped
by his grandmother with one hand while
with the other she divided the hair upon
his forehead which was now crimson with
bashfulness while she added with a mixture
 proud affection and firm resolution
 ay look at him well my sister for on
a fairer face thine eye never rested i too
when first i saw him felt as the worldly
feel and was half shaken in my purpose
but no wind can tear a leaf from the withered
tree which has long been stripped
 its foliage and no mere human casualty
can awaken the mortal feelings which have
long slept in the calm devotion
while the old woman thus spokes her
 the abbot
manner gave the lie to her assertions for
the tears rose to lier eyes while she added
but the fairer and the more spotless the
victim is it not my sister the more worthy
 acceptance she seemed glad to escape
from the sensations which agitated her and
instantly added he will escape my sister
 there will be a ram caught in the
thicket and the hand our revolted brethren
shall not be on the youthful joseph
heaven can defend its own rights even by
means babes and sucklings women
and beardless boys
heaven hath left us said the other
female for our sins and our fathers the
succours the blessed saints have abandoned
this accursed land we may win
the crown martyrdom but not that 
earthly triumph one too whose prudence
was at this deep crisis so indispensable has
been called to a better world the abbot
eustatius is no more
may his soul have mercy said magdalen
graeme and may heaven too have
the abbot 
mercy upon us who linger behind in this
bloody land his loss is indeed a perilous
blow to our enterprize for who remains behind
possessing his farfetched experience
his self devoted zeal his consummate wisdom
and his undaunted courage he hath
fallen with the church's standard in his
hand but god will raise up another to lift
the blessed banner whom have the chapter
elected in his room 
it is rumoured no one the few remaining
brethren dare accept the office
the heretics have sworn that they will permit
no future election and will heavily punish
any attempt to create a new abbot 
saint mary's coiijuiavermit inter se 
dictates projiciamus jaques ejus
quotisquejdomine answered magdalen
 this my sister were indeed a perilous
and fatal breach in our band but i am
firm in my belief that another will arise
in the place him so untimely removed
where is thy daughter catherine
 the abbot
 in the parlour answered the matron
 but she looked at roland graeme
and muttered something in the ear her
friend
fear it not answered magdalen graeme
it is both lawful and necessary fear nothing
from him i would he were as well
grounded in the faith by which alone comes
safety as he is free from thought deed or
speech villainy therein is the heretics
discipline to be commended my sister
that they train up their youth in strong morality
and choak up every inlet to youthful
folly
 it is but a cleansing the outside 
the cup answered her friend a whitening
 the sepulchre but he shall see catherine
since you sister judge it safe and
meet follow us youth she added and
led the way from the apartment with her
friend these were the only words which
the matron had addressed to roland graeme
who obeyed them in silence as they paced
the abbot 
through several winding passaigesafifi wafe
apartments with a very slow step the young
page had leisure to make some reflections on
his situation reflections a nature which
his ardent temper considered as specially
disagreeable it seemed he had now got
two mistresses or buttresses instead one
both elderly women and both it would
seem in league to direct his motions according
to their own pleasure and for the
accomplishment plans to which he was
no party this he thought was too much 
arguing reasonably enough that whatever
right his grandmother and benefactress had
to guide his motions she was neither entitled
to transfer her authority or to divide
it with another who seemed to assume
without ceremony the same tone absolute
command over him
but it shall not long continue thus
thought roland i will not be all my life
the slave a woman's whistle to live
upon her exhibition go when she bids and
vol i k
 the abbot
come when she calls no by saint andrew
 the hand that can hold the lance is
above the controul the distaff i will
leave them the slip'd collar in their hands
on the first opportunity and let them execute
their own devices by their own proper
force it may save them both from a peril
for i guess what they meditate is not like
to prove either safe or easy the earl 
murray and his heresy are too well rooted
to be grubbed up by two old women
as he spoke thus they entered a low
room in which a third female was seated
this apartment was the first he had observed
in the mansion which was furnished
with moveable seats and with a wooden
table over which was laid a piece tapestry
a carpet was spread on the floor
there was a firegrate in the chimney and
in brief the apartment had the air being
habitable and inhabited
but roland's eyes found better employment
than to make observations on the acthe
abbot 
commendations the chamber for this
second female inhabitant the mansion
seemed something very different from anything
he had yet seen there at his first
entry she had greeted with a silent and
low obeisance the two aged matrons then
glancing her eyes towards roland she adjusted
a veil which hung back over her
shoulders so as to bring it over her face 
an operation which she performed with
much modesty but without either affected
haste or embarrassed timidity
during this manoeuvre roland had time
to observe that the face was that a girl
not much past sixteen apparently and that
the eyes were at once soft and brilliant
to these very favourable observations was
added the certainty that the fair object to
whom they referred possessed an excellent
shape bordering perhaps on evibonpointy
and therefore rather that a hebe than 
a sylph but beautifully formed and shewn
to great advantage by the close jacket and
 the abbot
petticoat which she wore after a foreign
fashion the last not quite long enough absolutely
to conceal a very pretty foot which
rested on a bar the table at which she
sate her round arms and taper fingers very
busily employed in repairing the piece 
tapestry which was spread on it which exhibited
several deplorable fissures enough to
demand the utmost skill the most expert
seamstress
it is to be remarked that it was by stolen
glances that roland grasme contrived to
ascertain these interesting particulars and
he thought he could once or twice notwithstanding
the texture the veil detect
the damsel in the act taking similar cognizance
 his own person the matrons
in the meanwhile continued their separate
conversation eyeing from time to time the
young people in a manner which left roland
in no doubt that they were the subject
 their conversation at length he distinctly
heard magdalen graeme say these
the abbot 
words nay my sister we must give them
opportunity to speak together and to become
acquainted they must be personally
known to each other or how shall they
be able to execute what they are entrusted
with 
it seemed as if the matron not fully satisfied
with her friend's reasoning continued
to offer some objections but they
were borne down by her more dictatorial
friend
 it must be so she said my dear
sister let us therefore go forth on the
balcony to finish our conversation and
do you she said addressing roland and
the girl become acquainted with each
other
with this she stepped up to the young
woman and raising her veil discovered
features which whatever might be their
ordinary complexion were now covered
with a universal blush
libitum sit said magdalen looking at
the other matron
 the abbor
 viw licittun replied the other with reluctant
and hesitating acquiescence and
again adjusting the veil the blushing girl
she dropped it so as to shade though not
to conceal her countenance and whispered
to her in a tone loud enough for the page
to hear remember catherine who thou
art and for what destined
the matron then retreated with magdalen
greene through one the casements
 the apartment that opened on a large
broad balcony which with its ponderous
balustrade had once run along the whole
south front the building which faced to
the brook and formed a pleasant and commodious
walk in the open air it was now
in some places deprived the balustrade
in others broken and narrowed but ruinous
as it was could still be used as a pleasant
promenade here then walked the
two ancient dames busied in their private
conversation yet not so much so but what
roland could observe the matrons as their
the abbor 
thin forms darkened the casement in passing
or repassing before it dart a glance into
the apartment to see how matters were
going on there
 the ajbbpt
chapter xi
life hath its may and all is mirthful then 
the woods are vocal and the flowers all odour 
its very blast has mirth isn't and the maidens
the while they don their cloaks to skreen their kirtles
laugh at the rain that wets them
old flay
catherine was at the happy age innocence
and buoyancy spirit when after
the first moment embarrassment was over
a situation awkwardness like that in which
she was suddenly left to make acquaintance
with a handsome youth not even known to
her by name struck her in spite herself
in a ludicrous point view she bent her
beautiful eyes upon the work with which
she was busied and with infinite gravity
sate out the two first turns the matrons
upon the balcony j but then glancing her
the abbot 
deep blue eye a little towards roland and
observing the embarrassment under which
he laboured now shifting on his chair and
now dangling his cap the whole man evincing
that he was perfectly at a loss how
to open the conversation she could keep
her composure no longer but after a vain
struggle broke out into a sincere though
a very involuntary fit laughing so richly
accompanied by the laughter her merry
eyes which actually glanced through the
tears which the effort filled them with
and by the waving her rich tresses
that the goddess smiles herself never
looked more lovely than catherine at that
moment a court page would not have
left her long alone in her mirth but roland
was countrybred and besides having
some conceit as well as bashfulness
he took it into his head that he was himself
the object her inextinguishable laughter
his endeavours to sympathize with catherine
therefore could carry him no further
than into a forced giggle which had more
k 
 the abbot
 displeasure than mirth in it and which
so much enhanced that the girl that it
seemed to render it impossible for her ever
to bring her laughter to an with whatever
anxious pains she laboured to do so
for every one has felt that when a paroxysm
 laughter has seized him at a misbecoming
time and place the efforts which
he makes to suppress it nay the very sense
 the impropriety giving way to it tends
only to augment and prolong the irresistible
impulse
it was undoubtedly lucky for catherine
as well as for roland that the latter did
not share in the excessive mirth the former
for seated as she was with her back
to the casement catherine could easily
escape the observation the two matrons
during the course their promenade 
whereas graeme was so placed with his
side to the window that his mirth had he
shared that his companion would have
been instantly visible and could not have
failed to give offence to the personages in
the abbot 
question he sate however with some impatience
until catherine had exhausted
either her power or her desire laughing
and was returning with good grace to the
exercise her needle and then he observed
with some dryness that there seemed no
great occasion to recommend to them to
improve their acquaintance it seemed that
they were already tolerably familiar
catherine had an extreme desire to set
off upon a fresh score but she repressed it
strongly and fixing her eyes on her work
replied by asking his pardon and promising
to avoid future offence
roland had sense enough to feel that
an air offended dignity was very much
misplaced and that it was with a very different
bearing he ought to meet the deep
blue eyes which had borne such a hearty
burthen in the laughing scene he tried
therefore to extricate himself as well as he
could from his blunder by assuming a tone
 correspondent gaiety and requesting to
know the nymph how it was her pleads
the abbot
sure that they should proceed in improving
the acquaintance which had commenced so
merrily
that she said you must yourself
discover perhaps i have gone a step too far
in opening our interview
 suppose said roland graeme we
should begin as in a talebook by asking
each others names and histories
 it is right well imagined said catherine
 and shews an argue judgment do
you begin and i will listen and only put
in a question or two at the dark parts the
story come unfold then your name and
history my new acquaintance
i am called roland graeme and that
tall old woman is my grandmother
 and your tutoress good who are
your parents 
 they are both dead replied roland
 ay but who were they you had parents
i presume 
 i suppose so said roland but i
have never been able to learn much their
the abbot 
history my father was a scottish knight
who died gallantly in his stirrups my mother
was a grseme heather gill in the
debateable land most her family were
killed when the debateable country was
burned by lord maxwell and berries 
caerlaverock
 is it long ago said the damsel
 before i was born answered the page
that must be a terrible while since
said she shaking her head gravely look
you i cannot weep for them
 it needs not said the youth they
fell with honour
 so much for your lineage fair sir replied
his companion whom i like the
living specimen a glance at the casement
far more than those that are dead your
much honoured grandmother looks as if she
could make one weep in sad earnest and
now fair sir for your own person if you
tell not the tale faster it will be cut short
in the middle mother bridget pauses longi
er and longer every time she passes the
 the abbot
window and with her there is as little mirth
as in the grave your ancestors
my tale is soon told i was introduced
into the castle avenel to be page to the
lady the mansion
she is a strict huguenot is she not 
said the little maiden
as strict as calvin himself but my
grandmother can play the puritan when it
suits her purpose and she had some plan
 her own for quartering me in the castle
it would have failed however after we
had remained several weeks at the hamlet
but for an unexpected master ceremonies

and who was that said the girl
 a large black dog wolf by name who
brought me into the castle one day in his
mouth like a hurt wildduck and presented
me to the lady
a most respectable introduction truly
said catherine and what might you learn
at this same castle i love dearly to know
what my acquaintances can do at need
the abbot 
to fly a hawk hollow to a hound back
a horse and wield lance bow and brand
 and to boast all this when you have
learned it said catherine which in
france at least is the surest accomplishment
 a page but proceed fair sir how
came your huguenot lord and your no less
huguenot lady to receive and keep in the
family so perilous a person as a catholic
page 
 because they knew not that part 
my history which from a child i had been
taught to keep secret and because my
granddame's former zealous attendance on
their heretic chaplain had laid all this suspicion
to sleep most fair callipolis said
the page and in so saying edged his chair
towards the seat the fair querist
 nay but keep your distance most gallant
sir answered the blueeyed maiden
 for unless i greatly mistake these reverend
ladies will soon interrupt our amicable
conference if the acquaintance they recommend
shall seem to proceed beyond a certain
point so fair sir be pleased to abide
 the abbot
by your station and reply to my questions
by what achievements did you prove the
qualities a page which you had thus
happily acquired 
roland who began to enter into the tone
and spirit the damsel's conversation replied
to her with becoming spirit
in no feat fair gentlewoman was i
found inexpert wherein there was mischief
implied i shot swans hunted cats frightened
servingwomen chased the deer and
robbed the orchard i say nothing tormenting
the chaplain in various ways for
that was my duty as a good catholic
 now as i am a gentlewoman said catherine
 i think these heretics have done
catholic penance in entertaining so allaccomplished
a servingman and what fair
sir might have been the unhappy event
which deprived them an inmate so altogether
estimable 
 truly fair gentlewoman answered the
youth your real proverb says that the
longest lane will have a turning and mine
was more it was in fine a turning off
the abbot 
 good said the merry young maiden
 it is an apt play on the word and what
occasion was taken for so important a catastrophe
 nay start not for my learning
i do know the schools in plain phrase
why were you sent from service 
the page shrugged his shoulders while
jft replied
 a short tale is soon told and a short
horse soon curried i made the falconers
boy taste my switch the falconer threatened
to make me brook his cudgel he is s
kindly clown as well as a stout and i would
rather have been cudgelled by him than
any man in christendom to chuse but i
knew not his qualities as then so i threatened
to make him brook the stab and my
lady made me brook the begone so
adieu to the page's office and the fair castle
 avenel i had not travelled far before i
met my venerable parent and so tell your
tale fair gentlewoman for mine is done
a happy grandmother said the maiden
 who had the luck to find the stray
 the abbot
page just when his mistress had slipped his
leash and a most lucky page that has jumped
at once from a page to a gentlemanusher

 all this is nothing your history answered
roland grseme who began to be
much interested in the congenial vivacity 
this facetious young gentle woman tale
for tale is fellowtraveller's justice
 wait till we are fellowtravellers then
replied catherine
 nay you escape me not so said the
page if you deal not justly by me i will
call out to dame bridget or whatever your
dame be called and proclaim you for a
cheat
 you shall not need answered the
maiden my history is the counterpart
 your own the same words might almost
serve change but dress and name i am
called catherine seyton and i am an orphan

 have your parents been long dead 
 that is the only question said she
throwing down her fine eyes with a sudden
the abbot 
expression sorrow that is the only question
i cannot laugh at
and dame bridget is your grandmother

the sudden cloud passed away like that
which crosses for an instant the summer
sun and she answered with her usual lively
expression worse by twenty degrees
dame bridget is my maiden aunt
over gods forebode said roland 
alas that you have such a tale to tell 
and what horror comes next 
 your own history exactly i was taken
upon trial for service
 and turned off for pinching the duenna
or affronting my lady's waitingwoman

nay our history varies there said the
damsel our mistress broke up house or
had her house broke up which is the same
thing and i am a free woman the forest
and i am as glad it as if any one
had lined my doublet with cloth gold
said the youth
 the abbot
i thank you for your mirth said she
but the matter is not like to concern
you
nay but say on said the page for
you will be presently interrupted the two
good dames have been soaring yonder on
the balcony like two old hooded crows
and their croak grows hoarser as night
comes on they will wing to roost presently
 this mistress yours fair gentlewoman
who was she in god's name 
 o hp has a fair name in the world
replied catherine seyton few ladies
kept a fairer house or held more gentlewomen
in her household my aunt bridget
was one her housekeepers we never
saw her blessed face to be sure but we
heard enough her were up early and
down late and were kept to long prayers
and light food
 out upon the penurious beldame 
said the page
 for heaven's sake blaspheme not
said the girl with an expression fear
the abbot 
god pardon us both i meant no harm
i speak our blessed saint catherine 
sienna may god forgive me that i spoke
so lightly and made you do a great sin and
a great blasphemy this was her nunnery
in which there were twelve nuns and an
abbess my aunt was the abbess till the heretics
turned all adrift
and where are your companions
asked the youth
 with the last year's snow answered
the maiden east north south and west
some to france some to flanders some
i fear into the world and its pleasures
we have got permission to remain or rather
our remaining has been connived at
for my aunt has great relations among the
kerr and they have threatened a deathbed
if any one touches us and bow and
spear are the best warrant in these times
nay then you sit under a sure shadow
said the youth and i suppose you
wept yourself blind when saint catherine
broke up housekeeping before you had taken
arles in her service 
ifflicleiirnestmnney
 the abbot
 hush for heaven's sake said the
damsel crossing herself no more that j
but i have not quite cried my eyes out
said she turning them upon him and instantly
again bending them upon her work
it was one those glances which would
require the threefold plate brass around
the heart more than it is needed by the
mariners to whom horace recommends it
our youthful page had no defence whatever
to offer
what say you catherine he said if
we two thus strangely turned out service
at the same time should give our two
most venerable duennas the torch to hold
while we walk a merry measure with each
other over the floor this weary world 
 a goodly proposal truly said catherine
 and worthy the madcap brain a
discarded page and what shifts does your
worship propose we should live by by
singing ballads cutting purses or swaggering
on the highway for there i think
you would find your most productive exchequer

the abbot 
 chuse you proud peat said the page
drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and
unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild
proposal was received and as he spoke
the words the casement was again darkened
by the forms the matrons it opened
and admitted magdalen grme and the
mother abbess so we must now style her
into the apartment
 the abbot
chapter xii
nay hear me brother i am elder wiser
and homer than thou and age and wisdom
and holiness have peremptory claims
and will be listened to
old play
when the matrons reentered and put
an to the conversation which we have
detailed in the last chapter dame magdalen
graeme thus addressed her grandson
and his pretty companion have you
spoke together my children have you
become known to each other as fellowtravellers
on the same dark and dubious road
whom chance hath brought together and
who study to learn the tempers and dispositions
 those by whom their perils are to
be shared 
the abbot 
it was seldom the lighthearted catherine
could suppress a jest so that she often
spoke when she would have acted more
wisely in holding her peace
your grandson admires the journey
which you propose so very greatly that he
was even now preparing for setting out
upon it instantly
 this is to be too forward roland
said the dame addressing him as yesterday
you were over slack the just mean
lies in obedience which both waits for the
signal to start and obeys it when given 
but once again my children have you so
perused each other's countenances that
when you meet in whatever disguise the
times may impose upon you you may recognize
each in the other the secret agent
 the mighty work in which you are to
be leagued look at each other know
each line and lineament each other's
countenance learn to distinguish by the
step by the sound the voice by the movol

 the abbot
tionof the hand by the glaticeof the eye
the partner whom heaven hath sent to aidin
working its will wilt thou know that
maiden whensoever or wheresoever you
shall again meet her my roland graeme 
as readily as truly did roland answer
in the affirmative and thou my daughter
wilt thou again remember the features
 this youth 
 truly mother replied catherine seyton
 i have not seen so many men late
that i should immediately forget your grandson
though i mark not much about him that
is deserving special remembrance
 join hands then my children said
magdalen graeme but in saying so was
interrupted by her companion whose conventual
prejudices had been gradually giving
her more and more uneasiness and
who could remain acquiescent no longer
nay my good sister you forget said
she to magdalen catherine is the betrothed
bride heaven these intimacies cannot
be 
the abbot 
it is in the cause heaven that i command
them to embrace said magdalen
with the full force her powerful voice j
the sister sanctifies the means we
must use
 they call me lady abbess or mother
at the least who address me said dame
bridget drawing herself up as if offended
at her friend's authoritative manner the
lady heathergill forgets that she speaks
to the abbess saint catherine
when i was what you call me said
magdalen you indeed were the abbess
 saint catherine but both names are now
gone with all the rank that the world and
that the church gave to them and we are
now to the eye human judgment two
poor despised oppressed women dragging
our dishonoured old age to a humble grave
but what are we in the eye heaven 
ministers sent forth to work his will in
whose weakness the strength the church
shall be manifested before whom shall be
humbled the wisdom murray and the
 the abbot
dark strength morton and to such
wouldst thou apply the narrow rules thy
cloistered seclusion or hast thou forgotten
the order which i shewed thee from thy
superior subjecting thee to me in these matters

on thy head then be the scandal and
the sin said the abbess sullenly
on mine be they both said magdalen
 i say embrace each other my children

but catherine aware perhaps how the
dispute was likely to terminate had escaped
from the apartment and so disappointed
the grandson at least as much as the old
matron
she is gone said the abbess to provide
some little refreshment but it will
have little savour to those who dwell in the
world for i at least cannot dispense with
the rules to which i am vowed because it
is the will wicked men to break down the
sanctuary in which they wont to be observed

the abbot 
it is well my sister replied magdalen
 to pay each even the smallest tythes
 mint and cummin which the church demands
and i blame not thy scrupulous observance
 the rules thine order but
they were established by the church and
for the church's benefit and reason it is
that they should give way when the salvation
 the church herself is at stake
the abbess made no reply
one more acquainted with human nature
than the inexperienced page might have
found amusement in comparing the different
kinds fanaticism which these two females
exhibited the abbess timid narrowminded
and discontented clung to ancient
usages and pretensions which were ended
by the reformation and was in adversity
as she had been in prosperity scrupulous
weakspirited and bigotted while the fiery
and more lofty spirit her companion suggested
a wider field effort and would not
be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary
schemes which were suggested by her
 the abbot
bold and irregular imagination but roland
graeme instead tracing these peculiarities
 character in the two old dames
only waited with great anxiety for the return
 catherine expecting probably that
the proposal the fraternal embrace would
be renewed as his grandmother seemed disposed
to carry matters with a high hand
his expectations or hopes if we may
call them so were however disappointed
 for when catherine reentered on the
summons the abbess and placed on the
table an earthen pitcher water and four
wooden platters with cups the same materials
the dame heathergill satisfied
with the arbitrary mode in which she had
borne down the opposition the abbess
pursued her victory no farther a moderation
for which her grandson in his heart
returned her but slender thanks
in the meanwhile catherine continued to
place upon the table the slender preparations
for the meal a recluse which consisted
almost entirely cole wort boiled
the abbot 
and served up in an earthen platter having
no better seasoning than a little salt and no
better accompaniment than some coarse
barleybread in very moderate quantity
the waterpitcher already mentioned furnished
the only beverage after a latin
grace delivered by the abbess the guests
sat down to their spare entertainment the
simplicity the fare appeared to produce
no distaste in the females who ate it moderately
but with the usual appearance 
appetite but roland grseme had been
used to better cheer sir halbert glendining
who affected even an unusual degree
 nobleness in his housekeeping maintained
it in a style genial hospitality
which rivalled that the northern barons
 england he might think perhaps that
by doing so he acted yet more completely
the part for which he was not born 
that a great baron and a leader two
bullocks and six sheep weekly were the
allowance when the baron was at home
and did not greatly diminish during his ab
 the abbot
sence a boll malt was weekly brewed
into ale which was used by the household
at discretion bread was baked in proportion
for the consumption his domestics
and retainers and in this scene plenty
had roland graeme now lived for several
years it formed a bad introduction to lukewarm
greens and spring water and probably
his countenance indicated some sense
 the difference for the abbess observed
 it would seem my son that the tables
 the heretic baron whom you have so
long followed are more daintily furnished
than those the suffering daughters the
church and yet not upon the roost solemn
nights festival when the nuns were permitted
to eat their portion at mine own table
did i consider the cates which were
then served up as half so delicious as these
vegetables and this water on which i prefer
to feed rather than do aught which may
derogate from the strictness my vow it
shall never be said that the mistress this
house made it a house feasting when days
the abbot 
 darkness and affliction were hanging
over the holy church which i am an
unworthy member
well hast thou said my sister replied
magdalen graeme but now it is not only
time to suffer in the good cause but to act
in it and since our pilgrim's meal is finished
let us go apart to prepare for our journey
 tomorrow and to advise on the
manner in which these children shall be employed
and what measures we can adopt to
supply their thoughtlessness and lack discretion

notwithstanding his indifferent cheerthe
heart roland graeme bounded high at
this proposal which he doubted not would
lead to another teteastute betwixt him and
the pretty novice but he was mistaken
catherine it would seem had no mind sofar
to indulge him for moved either by delicacy
or caprice or some those indescribable
shades betwixt the one and the other
with which women love to teaze and at the
same time to captivate the ruder sex she
l
 the abbot
reminded the abbess that it was necessary
she should retire for an hour before vespers
 and receiving the ready and approving
nod her superior she arose to
withdraw but before leaving the apartment
she made obeisance to the matrons
bending herself till her hands touched her
knees and then made a slighter reverence
to roland which consisted in a slight bend
 the body and gentle depression the
head this she performed very demurely 
but the party on whom the salutation was
conferred thought he could discern in her
manner an arch and mischievous exultation
over his secret disappointment the devil
take the saucy girl he thought in his
heart though the presence the abbess
should have repressed all such profane imaginations
 she is as hardhearted as the
laughing hyaena that the storybooks tell 
she has a mind that i shall not fot her
this night at least
the matrons now retired also gvx the
page to understand that he was on no acthe
abbot 
count to stir from the convent or to shew
himself at the windows the abbess expressing
as a reason the readiness with which
the rude heretics caught at every occasion
 scandahzing the religious orders
this is worse than the rigour mr henry
warden himself said the page when
he was left alone j for to do him justice
however strict in requiring the most rigid
attention during the time his homilies
he left us to the freedom our own wills
afterwards ay and would take a share in
our pastimes too if he thought them entirely
innocent but these old women are
utterly wrapt up in gloom mystery and
selfdenial well then if i must neither
stir out the gate nor look out at window
i will at least see what the inside the
house contains that may help to pass away
one's time peradventure i may light on
that blueeyed laugher in some corner or
other
going therefore out the chamber by
the entrance opposite to that through which
 the abbot
the two matrons had departed for it maybe
readily supposed he had no desire to
intrude on their privacy he wandered
from one chamber to another through the
deserted edifice seeking with boyish eagerness
some source interest or amusement
here he passed through a long gallery
opening on either hand into the little cells
 the nuns all deserted and deprived 
the few trifling articles furniture which
the rules the order admitted
the birds are flown thought the page
but whether they will find themselves worse
oflt in the open air than in these damp
narrow cages i leave my lady abbess
and my venerable relative to settle betwixt
them i think the lark which they have
left behind them would like best to sing
under god's free sky
a winding stair strait and narrow as
if to remind the nuns their duties fast
and maceration led down to a lower suite
 apartments which occupied the ground
story the house these rooms were even
the abbot 
more ruinous than those which he had left 
for having encountered the first fury the
assailants by whom the nunnery had been
wasted the windows had been dashed in
the doors broken down and even the partitions
betwixt the apartments in some
places destroyed as he thus stalked
from desolation to desolation and began to
think returning from so uninteresting a
research to the chamber which he had left
he was surprised to hear the low a cow
very close to him the sound was so unexpected
at the time and place that roland
graeme started as if it had been the voice
 a lion and laid his hand on his dagger
while at the same moment the light and
lovely form catherine seyton presented
itself at the door the apartment from
which the sound had issued
 good even to you valiant champion 
said she since the days guy warwick
never was one more worthy to encounter
a dun cow
cow said roland grme by my
 the abbot
faith i thought it had been the devil that
roared so near me who ever heard a
convent containing a cowhouse 
cow and calf may come hither now
answered catherine for we have no means
to keep out either but i advise you kind
sir to return to the place from whence you
came
 not till i see your charge fair sister
answered roland and made his way into
the apartment in spite the half serious
half laughing remonstrances the girl
the poor solitary cow now the only severe
recluse within the nunnery was quartered
in a spacious chamber which had once
been the refectory the convent the roof
was graced with groined arches and the wall
with niches from which the images had
been pulled down these remnants architectural
ornaments were strangely contrasted
with the rude crib and manger constructed
for the cow in one corner the
apartment and the stack fodder which
was piled beside it for her food
the abbot 
 by my faith said the page crosbie
is more lordly lodged than any one here
you had best remain with her said
catherine and supply by your filial attentions
the offspring she has had the ill luck
to lose
 i will remain at least to help you to
prepare her night's lair pretty catherine
said roland seizing upon a pitchfork
by no means said catherine for
besides that you know not in the least todo
her that service you will bring a chiding
my way and i get enough that in the
regular course things
 what for accepting my assistance 
said the page for accepting m assistance
who am to be your confederate in
some deep matter import that were
altogether unreasonable and now i think
on it tell me if you can what is this mighty
emprize to which i am destined 
 robbing a bird's nest i should suppose
said catherine considering the
champion whom they have selected
 the abbot
by my faith said the youth and
he that has taken a falcon's nest in the
scars polmoodie has done something
to brag my fair sister but that is allover
now a murrain on the nest and the
classes and their food washed or unwashed
for it was all anon cramming these
worthless kites that i was sent upon my
present travels save that i have met with
you pretty sister i could eat my daggerhilt
for vexation at my own folly but as
we are to be fellowtravellers
 fellowlabourers not fellowtravellers
answered the girl j for to your comfort
be it known that the lady abbess and
i set out earlier than you and your respected
relative tomorrow and that i partly endure
your company at present because it
may be long ere we meet again
by saint andrew but it shall not
though answered roland i will not
hunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples

 i suspect in that and in other points
the abbot 
we must do as we are bid but hark i
hear my aunt's voice
the old lady entered in good earnest
and darted a severe glance at her niece
while roland had the ready wit to busy
himself about the halter the cow
the young gentleman said catherine
gravely is helping me to tie the cow up
faster to her stake for i find that last night
when she put her head out window and
lowed she alarmed the whole village and
we will be suspected sorcery among the
heretics if they do not discover the cause
 the apparition or lose our cow if they
do
relieve yourself that fear said the
abbess somewhat ironically the person
to whom she is now sold comes for the
animal presently
good night then my poor companion
said catherine patting the animal's
shoulders i hope thou hast fallen into
kind hands for my happiest hours late
have been spent in tending thee i would
i had been born to no better task
 the abbot
 now out upon thee meanspirited
wench said the abbess is that a speech
worthy the name seyton or the
mouth a sister this house treading the
path election and to be spoken before
a stranger youth too go to my oratory
minion there read your hours till i
come thither when i will read you such a
lecture as shall make you prize the blessings
which you possess
catherine was about to withdraw in silence
casting a half sorrowful half comic
glance at roland gramme which seemed to
say you see to what your untimely visit
has exposed me when suddenly changing
her mind she came forward to the page
and extended her hand as she bid him good
evening their palms had pressed each
other ere the astonished matron could interfere
and catherine had time to say 

 the abbot
ry's men who dare worship where their predecessors
prayed while alive and were interred
when dead follow me this way my
son
roland graeme followed accordingly 
and magdalen casting a hasty glance to
see whether they were observed for she had
learned caution from the danger the
times commanded her grandson to knock
at a little wicket which she pointed out to
him but knock gently she added with
a motion expressive caution after a
little space during which no answer was
returned she signed to roland to repeat
his summons for admission and the door
at length partially opening discovered a
glimpse the thin and timid porter by
whom the duty was performed skulking
from the observation those who stood
without but endeavouring at the same time
to gain a sight them without being himself
seen how different from the proud
and dignified consciousness with which the
porter ancient days offered his important
brow and his goodly person to the pile
abbot 
grins who repaired to kennaquhair his
solemn ingrate meijiui was exchanged
for a tremulous you cannot enter now 
the brethren are in their chambers bat
when magdalen graeme asked in an undertone
 voice hast thou forgotten me my
father he changed his apologetic refusal
to enter my honoured sister enter speedily
for evil eyes are upon us
they entered accordingly and having
waited until the porter had with jealous
haste barred and bolted the wicket were
conducted by him through several dark and
winding passages as they walked slowly
on he spoke to the matron in a subdued
voice as if he feared to trust the very walls
with the avowal which he communicated
our fathers are assembled in the chapterhouse
worthy sister yes in the chapterhouse
 for the election an abbots 
ah benedicite there must be no ringing
 bells no high mass no opening the
great gates now that the people might see
and venerate their spiritual father our
 the abbot
fathers must hide themselves rather like
robbers who chuse a leader than godly
priests who elect a mitred abbot
 regard not that my brother answered
magdalen graeme the first successors
 saint peter himself were elected not in
sunshine but in tempests not in the halls
 the vatican but in the subterranean
vaults and dungeons heathen rome 
they were not granulated with shouts and
salvos cannonshot and musketry
and the display artificial fire no my
brother but by the hoarse summons 
victors and praetors who came to drag the
fathers the church to martyrdom from
such adversity was the church once raised
and by such will it now be purified and
mark me brother not in the proudest days
 the mitred abbey was a superior ever
chosen whom his office shall so much honour
as he shall be honoured who now
takes it upon him in these days tribulation
on whom my brother will the choice
fall 
the abbot 
on whom can it fall or alas who
would dare to reply to the call save the
worthy pupil the sainted eustatius the
good and valiant father ambrose 
i know it said magdalen my heart
told me long ere your lips had uttered his
name stand forth courageous champion
and man the fatal breach rise bold and
experienced pilot and seize the helm while
the tempest rages turn back the battle
brave raiser the fallen standard i wield
crook and sling noble shepherd a scattered
flock 
i pray you hush my sister said the
porter opening a door which led into the
great church the brethren will he presently
here to celebrate their election with
a solemn mass i must marshall them the
way to the high altar all the offices this
venerable house have now devolved on one
poor decrepit old man
he left the church and magdalen and
roland remained alone in that great vaulted
space whose style rich yet chaste
 the abbot
architecture referred its origin to the early
part the fourteenth century the best period
 gothic building but the niches
were stripped their images in the inside
as well s the outside the church and
in the pellmell havoc the tombs warriors
and princes had been included in
the demolition the idolatrous shrines
lances and swords antique size which
had hung over the tombs mighty warriors
 former days lay now strewed among reliques
with which the devotion pilgrims
had graced those their peculiar saints 
and the fragments the knights and dames
which had once lain recumbent or kneeled
in an attitude devotion where their mortal
reliques were reposed were mingled
with those the saints and angels the
gothic chisel which the hand violence
had sent headlong from their stations
the most fatal symptom the whole appeared
to be that though this violence had
now been committed for many months the
fathers had lost so totally all heart and resolve
abbot 
lotion that they had not adventured even
upon clearing away the rubbish or restoring
the church to some decent degree order
this might have been done without much
labour but terror had overpowered the
scanty remains a body once so powerful
and sensible they were only suffered to remain
in this ancient seat by connivance and
from compassion they'd not venture upon
taking any step which might be construed
into an assertion their ancient rights
contenting themselves with the secret and
obscure exercise their religious ceremonial
in as unostentatious a manner as was
possible
two or three the more aged brethren
had sunk under the pressure the times
and the ruins had been partly cleared away
to permit their interment one stone had
been laid over father nicholas which recorded
 him in special that he had taken
the vows during the incumbency abbot
ingelramthe period to which his memory so
frequently recurred another flag stone yet
more recently deposited covered the body
 the abbot
 peter the sacristan eminent for his aquatic
excursion with the phantom avenel 
and a third the most recent all bore the
outline a mitre and the words hicjacet
eustatius ahhas for no one dared to add
a word commendation in favour his
learning and strenuous zeal for the roman
catholic faith
magdalen graeme looked at and perused
the brief records these monuments successively
and paused over that father
eustace in a good hour for thyself she
said but oh in an evil hour for the church
wert thou called from us let thy spirit be
with us holy man encourage thy successor
to tread in thy footsteps give him thy
bold and inventive capacity thy zeal and
thy discretion even tk piety exceeds
not his as she spoke a side door which
closed a passage from the abbot's house
into the church was thrown open that the
fathers might enter the choir and conduct
to the high altar the superior whom they
had elected
in former times this was one the most
the abbot 
splendid the many pageants which the
hierarchy rome had devised to attract
the veneration the faithful the period
during which the abbacy remained vacant
was a state mourning or as their emblematical
phrase expressed it widowhood 
a melancholy term which was changed into
rejoicing and triumph when a new superior
was chosen when the foldingdoors
were on such solemn occasions thrown
open and the new abbot appeared on the
threshold in fullblown dignity with ring
and mitre and dalmatia and crosier his
hoary standardbearers and his juvenile dispensers
 incense preceding him and the
venerable train monks behind him withall
besides which could announce the supreme
authority to which he was now raised
his appearance was a signal for the magnificent
jubilate to rise from the organ and
musicloft and to be joined by the corresponding
bursts hallelujah from the whole
assembled congregation now all was changed
in the midst rubbish and desolation
 the abbot
seven or eight old men bent and shaken as
much by grief and fear as by age shrouded
hastily in the proscribed dress their order
wandered like a procession spectres from
the door which had been thrown open up
through the encumbered passage to the
high altar there to instal their elected superior
a chief ruins it was like a band
 bewildered travellers chusing a chief in
the wilderness arabia or a shipwrecked
crew electing a captain upon the barren
island on which fate has thrown them
they who in peaceful times are most
ambitious authority among others shrink
from the competition at such eventful periods
when neither ease nor parade attend
the possession it and when it gives only
a painful preeminence both in danger and
in labour and exposes the ill fated chieftain
to the murmurs his discontented associates
as well as to the first assault the
common enemy but he on whom the office
 the abbot saint mary's was now
conferred had a mind fitted for the situathe
abbot 
tion to which he was called bold and enthusiastic
yet generous and forgiving 
wise and skilful yet zealous and prompt 
he wanted but a better cause than the support
 a decaying superstition to have
raised him to the rank a truly great man
but as the crowns the work it also
forms the rule by which it must be ultimately
judged and those who with sincerity
and generosity fight and fall in an
evil cause posterity can only compassionate
as victims a generous but fatal error
amongst these we must rank ambrosius
the last abbot kennaquhair whose designs
must be condemned as their success
would have rivetted on scotland the chains
 antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny
 but whose talents in themselves
commanded respect and whose virtues
even from the enemies his faith extorted
esteem
the bearing the new abbot served 
itself to dignify a ceremonial which was deprived
 all other attributes grandeur
 the abbot
conscious the peril in which they stood
and recalling doubtless the better days
they had seen there hung over his brethren
an appearance mingled terror and
grief and shame which induced them to
hurry over the office in which they were
engaged as something at once degrading
and dangerous
but not so father ambrose his features
indeed expressed a deep melancholy
as he walked up the centre aisle
amid the ruins things which he considered
as holy but his brow was undetected
and his step firm and solemn he
seemed to think that the dominion which
he was about to receive depended in no
sort upon the external circumstances under
which it was conferred and if a mind
so firm was accessible to sorrow or fear it
was not on his own account but on that 
the church to which he had devoted himself

at length he stood on the broken steps
 the high altar barefooted as was the
the abbot 
rule and holding in his hand his pastoral
staff for the gemmed ring and jewelled
mitre had become secular spoils no obedient
vassals came man after man to make
their homage and to offer the tribute which
should provide their spiritual superior with
palfrey and trappings no bishop assisted
at the solemnity to receive into the
higher ranks the church nobility a dignitary
whose voice in the legislature was
as potential as his own with hasty and
maimed rites the few remaining brethren
stepped forward alternately to give their
new abbot the kiss peace in token
 fraternal affection and spiritual homage
mass was then hastily performed but in
such precipitation as if it had been hurried
over rather to satisfy the scruples ol
a few youths who were impatient to set
out on a hunting party than as if it made
the most solemn part a solemn ordination
the officiating priest faultered as he
spoke the service and often looked around
 the abbor
as if he expected to be interrupted in the
midst his office and the brethren listened
as to that which short as it was they
wished yet more abridged
these symptoms alarm increased as
the ceremony proceeded and as it seemed
were not caused by mere apprehension
alone for amid the pauses the hymn
there were heard without sounds a very
different sort beginning faintly and at a
distance but at length approaching close
to the exterior the church and stunning
with dissonant clamour those engaged in
the service the winding horns blown
with no regard to harmony or concert the
jangling bells the thumping drums
the squeaking bagpipes and the clash 
cymbals the shouts a multitude now
as in laughter now as in anger the shrill
tones female voices and those children
mingling with the deeper clamours 
men formed a babel sounds which first
drowned and then awed into utter silence
the abbot 
the official hymns the convent the
cause and result this extraordinary interruption
will be explained in the next
chapter
 the abbot
chapter xiv
not the wild billow when it breaks its barrier 
not the wild wind escaping from its cavern 
not the wild fiend that mingles both together
and pours their rage upon the ripening harvest
can match the wild freaks this mirthful meeting 
comic yet fearful droll and yet destructive
the conspiracy
the monks ceased their song which like
that the choristers in the legend the
witch berkeley died away in a quaver 
consternation j and like a flock chickens
disturbed by the presence the kite they
at first made a movement to disperse and
fly in different directions and then with
despair rather than hope huddled themselves
around their new abbot who retaining
the lofty and undismayed look which
had dignified him through the whole cerethe
abbot 
mony stood on the higher step the altar
as if desirous to be the most conspicuous
mark on which danger might discharge itself
and to save his companions by his selfdevotion
since he could afford them no
other protection
involuntarily as it were maid ale gram e
and the page stepped from the station which
hitherto they had occupied unnoticed and
approached to the altar as desirous sharing
the fate which approached the monks
whatsoever that might be both bowed reverently
love to the abbot and while magdalen
seemed about to speak the youth
looking towards the main entrance at which
the noise now roared most loudly and which
was at the same time assailed with much
knocking laid his hand upon his dagger
the abbot motioned to both to forbear 
 peace my sister he said in a low tone
but which being in a different key from the
tumultuary sounds without could be distinctly
heard even amidst the tumult 
 peace he said my sister j let the new
vol i n
 the abbot
superior saint mary's himself receive and
reply to the grateful acclamations the
vassals who come to celebrate his installation
and thou my son forbear i charge
thee to touch thy earthly weapon if it 
is the pleasure our protectress that her
shrine be this day desecrated by deeds 
violence and polluted by bloodshedding
let it not i charge you happen through the
deed a catholic son the church
the noise and knocking at the outer gate
became now every moment louder and
voices were heard impatiently demanding
admittance the abbot with dignity and
with a step which even the emergency 
danger rendered neither faultering nor precipitate
moved towards the portal and demanded
to know in a tone authority who
it was that disturbed their worship and what
they desired 
there was a moment's silence and then a
loud laugh from without at length a voice
replied we desire entrance into the
church and when the door is opened you
will soon see who we are
the abbot 
by whose authority do you require entrance
 said the father
 by authority the right reverend lord
abbot replied the voice from without 
and from the laugh which followed it seemed
as if there was something highly ludicrous
couched under this reply
i know not and seek not to know your
meaning replied the abbot since it is
probably a rude one but begone in the
name god and leave his servants in
peace i speak this as having lawful authority
to command here
 open the door said another rude
voice and we will try titles with you sir
monk and shew you a superior we must all
obey
 break open the doors if he dallies any
longer said a third and down with the
carrion monks who would bar us our privilege
a general shout followed ay
ay our privilege our privilege down with
the doors and with the lurdane monks if
they make opposition
the knocking was now exchanged for
 the abbot
blows math great hammers to which the
doors strong as they were must soon have
given way but the abbot who saw resists
ance would be vain and who did not wish
to incense the assailants by an attempt at
offering it besought silence earnestly and
with difficulty obtained a hearing my
children said he i will save you from
committing a great sin the porter will
presently undo the gate he is gone to fetch
the keys meantime i pray you to consider
if you are in a state mind to cross
the holy threshold
 tillyvalley for your papistry was answered
from without we are in the mood
 the monks when they are merriest and
that is when they sup beef brewis for lane
so if your porter hath not the
gout let him come speedily or we heave
away readily said i well comrades 
bravely said and it shall be as bravely
done said the multitude and had not
the keys arrived at that moment and the
porter in hasty terror performed his office
and thrown open the great door the popu
the abbot 
lace without would have saved him the trouble
the instant he had done so the affrighted
janitor fled like one who has drawn
the bolts a floodgate and expects to be
overwhelmed by the rushing inundation
the monks with one consent had withdrawn
themselves behind the abbot who
alone kept his station about three yards from
the entrance shewing no signs fear or
perturbation his brethren partly encouraged
by his devotion partly ashamed to
desert him and partly animated by a sense
 duty remained huddled close together
at the back their superior there was
a loud laugh and huzza when the doors were
opened j but contrary to what might have
been expected no crowd enraged assailants
rushed into the church on the
contrary there was a cry a halt a
halt to order my masters and let the two
reverend fathers greet each other as beseems
them
the appearance the crowd who were
thus called to order was grotesque in the
extreme it was composed men women
 the abbot
and children ludicrously disguised in various
habits and presenting groupes equally
diversified and ludicrous here one fellow
with a horse's head painted before him and
a tail behind and the whole covered with
a long footcloth which was supposed to
hide the body the animal ambled caracoled
pranced and plunged as he performed
the celebrated part the hobbiehorse
so often alluded to in our ancient drama 
and which still flourishes on the stage in
the battle that concludes bayes's tragedy
to rival the address and agility displayed by
this character another personage advanced
in the more formidable character a huge
dragon with gilded wings open jaws and
a scarlet tongue cloven at the which
made various efforts to overtake and devour
a lad dressed as the lovely sabsea daughter
 the king egypt who fled before him 
while a martial saint george grotesquely
armed with a goblet for a helmet and a
spit for a lance ever and anon interfered
and compelled the monster to relinquish
his prey a bear a wolf and one or two
the abbot 
other wild animals played their parts with
the discretion snug the joiner for the
decided preference which they gave to the
use their hind legs was sufficient without
any formal annunciation to assure the
most timorous spectators that they had to do
with habitual bipeds there was a groupe
 outlaws with robin hood and little
john at their head the best representation
exhibited at the time and no great wonder
since most the actors were by profession
the banished men and thieves whom they
presented other masqueraders there were
 a less marked description men were
disguised as women and women as men 
children wore the dress aged people and
tottered with crutchsticks in their hands
furred gowns on their little backs and caps
on their round heads while grandsires assumed
the infantine tone as well as the
dress children besides these many hat
their faces painted and wore their shirts
over the rest their dress while coloured
pasteboard and ribbands furnished out decorations
for others those who wanted
c the abbot
all these properties blacked their faces and
turned their jackets inside out and thus
the transmutation the whole assembly into
a set mad grotesque mummers was at
once completed
the pause which the masqueraders made
waiting apparently for some person the
highest authority amongst them gave those
within the abbey church full time to observe
all these absurdities they were at
no loss to comprehend their purpose and
meaning
few readers can be ignorant that at an
early period and during the plenitude 
her power the church rome not only
connived at but even encouraged such saturnalian
licenses as the inhabitants 
and the neighbourhood had now
in hand and that the vulgar on such occasions
where not only permitted but encouraged
by a number gambols sometimes
puerile and ludicrous sometimes immoral
and profane to indemnify themselves for
the privations and penances imposed on
tiem at other seasons but all other
the abbot 
topics for burlesque and ridicule the rites
and ceremonial the church itself were
most frequently resorted to and strange
to say with the approbation the clergy
themselves
while the hierarchy flourished in full
glory they do not appear to have dreaded
the consequences suffering the people to
become so irreverently familiar with things
sacred they then imagined the laity to
be much in the condition a labourer's
horse which does not submit to the bridle
and the whip with greater reluctance because
at rare intervals he is allowed to
frolic at large in his pasture and fling out
his heels in clumsy gambols at the master
who usually drives him but when times
changed when doubt the roman catholic
doctrine and hatred their priesthood
had possessed the reformed party the
clergy discovered too late that no small inconvenience
arose from the established practice
 games and merrymakings in which
they themselves and all they held most 
the abbot
cried were made the subject ridicule it
then became obvious to duller politicians
than the romish churchmen that the same
actions have a very different tendency when
done in the spirit sarcastic insolence and
hatred than when acted merely in exuberance
 rude and uncontrollable spirits
they therefore though the latest endeavoured
where they had any remaining
influence to discourage the renewal these
indecorous festivities in this particular the
catholic clergy were joined by most the
reformed preachers who were more shocked
at the profanity and immorality many 
these exhibitions than disposed to profit by
the ridiculous light in which they placed the
church rome and her observances but
it was long ere these scandalous and immoral
sports could be abrogated the rude multitude
continued attached to their favourite
pastimes and both in england and scotland
the mitre the catholic the rocket
 the reformed bishop and the cloak and
band the calvinistic divine were in
turn compelled to give place to these jocu
the abbot 
lar personages the pope fools the boybishop
and the abbot unreason
it was the latter personage who now in
full costume made his approach to the great
door the church st mary's accoutred
in such a manner as to form a caricature
or practical parody on the costume and
attendants the real superior whom he
came to beard on the very day his installation
in the presence his clergy and
in the chancel his church the mock
dignitary was a stoutmade undersized fellow
whose thick squab form had been rendered
grotesque by a supplemental paunch
well stuffed he wore a mitre leather
with the front like a grenadier's cap adorned
with mock embroidery and trinkets 
tin this surmounted a visage the nose 
which was the most prominent feature being
 unusual size and at least as richly
gemmed as his headgear his robe was 
from the interesting novel entitled anastatius t
seems the same burlesque ceremonies were practiced
in the greek church
 the abbot
buckram and his cope canvass curiously
painted and cut into open work on
one shoulder was fixed the painted figure
 an owl and he bore in the right hand
his pastoral staff and in the left a small
mirror having a handle to it thus resembling
a celebrated jester whose adventures
translated into english were whilom extremely
popular and which may still be procured
in black letter for about one pound
per leaf
the attendants this mock dignitary
had their proper dresses and equipage bearing
the same burlesque resemblance to the
officers the convent which their leader
did to the superior they followed their
leader in regular procession and the motley
characters which had waited his arrival
now crowded into the church in his train
shouting as they came a hall a hall for
the venerable father howleglas the learned
monk misrule and the right reverend
abbot unreason 
the discordant minstrelsy every kind
renewed its din the boys shrieked and
the abbot 
howled and the men laughed and halloed
and the women giggled and screamed and
the beasts roared and the dragon galloped
and hissed and the hobbyhorse neighed
pranced and capered and the rest frisked
and frolicked clashing their hobnailed shoes
against the pavement till it sparkled with
the marks their energetic caprioles
it was in fine a scene ridiculous confusion
that deafened the ear made the eyes
giddy and must have altogether stunned
any indifferent spectator whilst personal
apprehension and a consciousness that
much the popular enjoyment arose from
the ridicule being addressed against them
dismayed the monks who were moreover
little comforted by the reflection that
bold in their disguise the mummers who
whooped and capered around them might
on slight provocation turn their jest into
earnest or at least proceed to those practical
pleasantries which at all times arise
so naturally out the frolicsome and mischievous
disposition the metropolis 
they looked to their abbot amid the tusoi
the abbot
must with such looks as landsmen cast upon
the pilot when the storm is at the highest
 looks which express that they are devoid
 all hope arising from their own exertions
and not very confident in any success
likely to attend those their paulinus

the abbot himself specified at a stand 
he felt no fear but he was sensible the
danger expressing his rising indignation
which he was scarcely able to suppress he
made a gesture with his hand as if commanding
silence which was at first only replied
to by redoubled shouts and peals 
wild laughter when however the same
motion and as nearly in the same manner
had been made by howleglas it was immediately
obeyed by the riotous companions
who expected fresh food for mirth
in the conversation betwixt the real and
mock abbot having no small confidence
in the vulgar wit and impudence their
leader accordingly they began to shout
 to it fathersto it fight monk
the abbot 
fight madcap abbot against abbot is fair
play and so is reason against unreason and
malice against monkery 
 silence my mates said howleglas 
cannot two learned fathers the church
hold communing together but you must
come here with your beargarden whoop
and hollow as if you were hounding forth
a mastiff upon a mad bull i say silence 
and let this learned father and i confer
touching matters affecting our mutual state
and authority
my children said father ambrose
 mis children too and happy children
they are said his burlesque counterpart 
many a wise child knows not its own father
and it is well they have two to chuse
betwixt
 if thou hast aught in thee save scoffing
and ribaldry said the real abbot
 permit me for thine own soul's sake to
speak a few words to these misguided men
 aught in me but scoffing mayest thou 
retorted the abbot unreason why
reverend brother i have all that becomes
 the abbot
mine office at this time aday i have beef
ale and brandywine with other condiments
not worth mentioning and for
speaking man why speak away and we
will have turn about like honest fellows
during this discussion the wrath magdalen
graeme had risen to the uttermost 
she approached the abbot and placing herself
by his side said in a low and yet distinct
tone wake and arouse thee father
 the sword saint peter is in thy
hand strike and avenge saint peter's patrimony
 bind them in the chains which
being rivetted by the church on earth are
rivetted in heaven's
 peace sister said the abbot let
not their madness destroy our discretion 
i pray thee peace and let me do mine 
it is the first peradventure it may bethe
last time i shall be called on to discharge
it
nay my holy brother said howleglas
 i read you take the holy sister's advice
never throve convent without woman's
counsel s
the abbot 
 peace vain man said the abbot 
 and you my brethren 
nay nay said the abbot unreason
 no speaking to the lay people until you
have conferred with your brother the
cowl i swear by bell and candle
that not one my congregation shall listen
to one word you have to say so you had as
well address yourself to me who will
to escape a conference so ludicrous
the abbot again attempted an appeal to
what respectful feelings might yet remain
amongst the inhabitants the halidome
once so devoted to their spiritual superiors
alas the abbot unreason had only to
flourish his mock crosier and the whooping
the hallooing and the dancing were
renewed with a vehemence which would
have defied the lungs stentor
 and now my mates said the abbot
 unreason once again dight your gabs
and be hushed let us see if the cock 
kennaquhair will fight or flee the pit
there was again a dead silence expectation
 which father ambrose availed
 the abbot
himself to address his antagonist seeing
plainly that he could gain an audience on
no other terms wretched man said
he hast thou no better employment for
thy carnal wit than to employ it in leading
these blind and helpless creatures into the
pit utter darkness 
truly my brother replied howleglas
 i can see little difference betwixt your
employment and mine save that you make
a sermon a jest and i make a jest a
sermon
 unhappy being said the abbot who
hast no better subject pleasantry than
that which should make thee tremble no
sounder jest than thine own sins and no
better objects for laughter than those who
can absolve thee from the guilt them 
 verily my reverend brother said the
mock abbot what you say might be true
if in laughing at hypocrites i meant to
laugh at religion o it is a precious thing
to wear a long dress with a girdle and a
cowl we become a holy pillar mother
church and a boy must not play at ball
the abbot 
against the walls for fear breaking a
painted window
and will you my friends said the
abbot looking round and speaking with a
vehemence which secured him a tranquil
audience for some time will you suffer
a profane buffoon within the very church
 god to insult his ministers many 
you all you perhaps have lived under
my holy predecessors who were called upon
to rule in this church where i am called
upon to suffer if you have worldly goods
they are their gift and when you scorned
not to accept better gifts the mercy and
forgiveness the church were they not
ever at your command did we not pray
whileyouwerejovialwake while you slept
some the good wives the hali
dome were wont to say so said the abbot
 unreason but his jest met in this instance
but slight applause and father ambrose
having gained a moment's attention
hastened to improve it
 what said he j and is this grateful is
 the abbot
it seemly is it honest to assail with scorn
a few old men from whose predecessors you
hold all and whose only wish is to die in
peace among these fragments what was
once the light the land and whose daily
prayer is that they may be removed ere that
hour comes when the last spark shall be extinguished
and the land left in the darkness
which it has chosen rather than light we
have not turned against you the edge the
spiritual sword to revenge our temporal persecution
 the tempest your wrath has despoiled
us land and deprived us almost
 our daily food but we have not repaid
it with the thunders excommunication 
we only pray your leave to live and die
within the church which is our own invoking
god our lady and the holy saints
to pardon your sins and our own undisturbed
by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy

this speech so different in tone and termination
from that which the crowd had
expected produced an effect upon their
the abbot 
feelings unfavourable to the prosecution 
their frolic the more ice dancers stood
still the hobbyhorse surceased his capering
 pipe and tabor were mute and silence
like a heavy cloud seemed to descend
on the once noisy rabble several the
beasts were obviously moved to compunction
 the bear could not restrain his sobs
and a huge fox was observed to wipe his eyes
with his tail but in especial the dragon
lately so formidably rampant now relaxed
the terror his claws uncoiled his tremendous
rings and grumbled out his fiery
throat in a repentant tone by the mass
i thought no harm in exercising our old
pastime but an i had thought the good
father would have taken it so to heart i
would as soon have played your devil as
your dragon
in this momentary pause the abbot
stood amongst the miscellaneous and grotesque
forms by which he was surrounded
triumphant as saint anthony in ballots
temptations but howleglas would not so
resign his purpose
 the abbot
 and how now my masters said he 
 is this fair play or no have you not chosen
me abbot unreason and is it lawful
for any you to listen to common sense today
was i not formally elected by you in
solemn chapter held in luckier martin's
changehouse and will you now desert me
and give up your old pastime and privilege 
play out the play and he that speaks the
next word sense or reason or bids us
think or consider or the like that which
befits not the day i will have him solemnly
ducked in the milldam 
the rabble mutable as usual huzza'd
the pipe and tabor struck up the hobbyhorse
pranced the beasts roared and even
the repentant dragon began again to coil
up his spires and prepare himself for fresh
gambols but the abbot might have still
overcome by his eloquence and his entreaties
the malicious designs the revellers
had not dame magdalen graeme given
loose to the indignation which she had long
suppressed
the abbot 
 scoffers she said and men belial
blasphemous heretics and truculent tyrants

your patience my sister entreat and
i command you said the abbot let me
do my duty disturb me not in mine own
office 
but dame magdalen continued to thunder
forth her threats in the name popes
and councils and in the name every
saint from saint michael downward
my comrades said the abbot unreason
 this good dame hath not spoke a
single word reason and therein may
esteem herself free from the law but
what she spoke was meant for reason and
therefore unless she confesses and avouches
all which she has said to be nonsense it
shall pass for such so far as to incur the
penalty our statutes wherefore holy
dame pilgrim or abbess or whatever thou
art be mute with thy mummery or beware
the milldam we will have neither spiritual
nor temporal scolds in our diocese
 unreason 
 the abbot
as he spoke thus he extended his hand
towards the old woman while his followers
shouted a doom a doom and prepared
to second his purpose when lo it was suddenly
frustrated roland graeme had witnessed
with indignation the insults offered
to his old spiritual preceptor but yet had
wit enough to reflect he could render him
no assistance but might well by ineffective
interference make matters worse but when
he saw his aged relative in danger personal
violence he gave way to the natural
impetuosity his temper and stepping
forward struck his poniard into the body
 the abbot unreason whom the blow
instantly prostrated on the pavement
the abbot 
chapter xv
as when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd
mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
and stones and brands in rattling holies fly
and all the rustic arras which fury can supply 
then if some grave and pious man appear
they hush their noise and lend a listening ear
dryden's virgil
a dreadful shout vengeance was raised
by the revellers whose sport was thus
so fearfully interrupted but for an instant
the want weapons amongst the multitude
as well as the inflamed features and
brandished poniard roland grasme kept
them at bay while the abbot horrorstruck
at the violence implored with uplifted
hands pardon for bloodshed committed
within the holy sanctuary magdalen
grasme alone expressed triumph in the
vol i o
s the abbot
blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer
mixed however with a wild and anxious
expression terror for her grandson's safety
 let him perish she said in his
blasphemy let him die en the holy pavement
which he has insulted
but the rage the multitude the grief
 the abbot the exultation the enthusiastic
magdalen were all mistimed and unnecessary
the mortally wounded howled
as he was supposed sprung alertly up
from the floor calling aloud a miracle
a miracle my masters as brave a miracle
as ever was wrought in the kirk kenna
quhair and i charge you my masters as
your lawfully chosen abbot that you touch
no one without my command you wolf
and bear will guard this pragmatic youth
but without hurting him and you reverend
brother will with your comrades
withdraw to your cells for our conference
has ended like all conferences leaving each
 his own mind as before and if we fight
both you and your brethren and the kirk
the abbot 
will have the worst on't wherefore pack
up your pipes and begone
the hubbub was beginning again to awaken
but still father ambrose hesitated as
uncertain to what path his duty called him
whether to face out the present storm or
to reserve himself for a better moment his
brother unreason observed his difficulty
and said in a tone more natural and less affected
than that with which he had hitherto
sustained his character we came hither
my good sir more in mirth than in mischief
 our bark is worse than our bite
and especially we mean you no personal
harm wherefore draw off while the play
is good j for it is ill whistling for a hawk
when she is once on the soar and worse to
snatch the quarry from the ban dog let
these fellows once begin their brawl and
it will be too much for madness itself let
alone the abbot unreason to bring them
back to the lure
the brethren crowded around father
ambrosius and joined in urging him to
 the abbot
give place to the torrent the present revel
was they said an ancient custom which his
predecessors had permitted and old father
nicholas himself had played the dragon
in the days the abbot ingram
 and we now reap the fruit the seed
which they have so unadvisedly sown said
ambrosius they taught men to make a
mock what is holy what wonder that the
descendants scoffers become robbers and
plunderers but be it as you list my bred
towards the contour and
you dame i command you by the authority
which i have over you and by your
respect for that youth's safety that you go
with us without farther speech yet stay
what are your intentions towards that
youth whom you detain prisoner wot ye
he continued addressing howleglas in a
stern tone voice that he bears the livery
 the house avenel they who fear
not the anger heaven may at least dread
the wrath man
 cumber not yourself concerning him
the abbot 
answered howleglas we know right well
who and what he is
 let me pray said the abbot in a tone
 entreaty that you do him no wrong
for the rash deed which he attempted in
his imprudent zeal
i say cumber not yourself about it
father answered howleglas but move
off with your train male and female or i
will not undertake to save yonder shesaint
from the duckingstool and as for bearings
malice my stomach has no room for
it it is he added clapping his hand on
his portly belly too well untasted outwith
straw and buckram gramercy to them
both they kept out that madcap's dagger
as well as a milan corslet could have done
in fact the homedriven poniard roland
graeme had lighted upon the stuffing
 the fictitious paunch which the abbot
 unreason wore as a part his characteristic
dress and it was only the force 
the blow which had prostrated that reverend
person on the ground for a moment
satisfied in some degree by this man's
 the abbot
assurances and compelled to give way to
superior force the abbot ambrosius retired
from the church at the head the
monks and left the court free for the revellers
to work their will but wild and
wilful as these rioters were they accompanied
the retreat the religions with none
 those shouts contempt and derision
with which they had at first hailed then
the abbot's discourse had affected some
 them with remorse others with shame
and all with a transient degree respect
they remained silent until the last monk
had disappeared through the sidedoor
which communicated with their dwellingplace
and even then it cost some exhortations
on the part howleglas some caprioles
 the hobbyhorse and some gallops
 the dragon to rouse once more the rebuked
spirit revelry
 and how now my masters said the
abbot unreason and wherefore look
on me with such blank jack a lent visages 
will you lose your old pastime for an oldwife's
tale saints and purgatory why
the abbot 
i thought you would have made all split
long since come strike up tabor and harp
strike up fiddle and beck dance and be
merry today and let care come tomorrow
bear and wolf look to your prisonerprance
hobby hiss dragon and halloo
boys we grow older every moment we
stand idle and life is too short to be spent
in playing mischance
this pithy exhortation was attended with
the effect desired they fumigated the
church with burnt wool and feathers instead
 incense put foul water into the
holywater basins and celebrated a parody
on the churchservice the mock abbot
officiating at the altar they sung ludicrous
and indecent parodies to the tune church
hymns they violated whatever vestments
or vessels belonging to the abbey they
could lay their hands upon and playing
every freak which the whim the moment
could suggest to their wild caprice at length
they fell to more lasting deeds demolition
pulled down and destroyed some 
the abbot
vet woodwork dashed out the painted
windows which had escaped former violence
and in their rigorous search after
sculpture dedicated to idolatry began to
destroy what ornaments yet remained entire
upon the tombs and around the cornices
 the pillars
the spirit demolition like other tastes
increases by indulgence from these lighter
attempts at mischief the more tumultuous
part the meeting began to meditate destruction
on a more extended scale let
lis heave it down altogether the old crow's
nest became a general cry among them 
 it has served the pope and his rooks too
long and up they struck a ballad which
was then popular among the lower classes
the pain that pagan full pride
hath blinded us over lang
for where the blind the blind doth lead
no marvel faith gae wrong
like prince and king
he led the ring
 all iniquity
sing hay trix trim go trix
under the greenwood tree
the abbot 
the bishop rich he could not preach
for sporting with the lasses
the silly friar behoved to fleece
for awmous as he passes
the curate his creed
he could not read
shame fa the company
sing hay trin trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
thundering out this chorus a notable
hunting song which had been pressed into
the service some polemical poet the followers
 the abbot unreason were turning
every moment more tumultuous and
getting beyond the management even 
that reverend prelate himself when a knight
in full armour followed by two or three
menatarms entered the church and in a
stern voice commanded them to forbear
their riotous mummery
his visor was up but if it had been lowered
the cognizance the hollybranch
sufficiently distinguished sir halbert glendining
who on his homeward road was
passing through the village kennaquhair
o 
 the abbot
and moved perhaps by anxiety for his brother's
safety had come directly to the
church on hearing the uproar
 what is the meaning this he said
my masters are ye christian men and
the king's subjects and yet waste and destroy
church and chancel like so many heathens

all stood silent though doubtless there
were several disappointed and surprised at
receiving chiding instead thanks from so
zealous a protestant
the dragon indeed did at length take
upon him to be spokesman and growled
from the depth his painted maw that
they did but sweep popery out the
church with the besom destruction
 what my friends replied sir albert
glendinning think you this mumming
and masking has not more popery
in it than have these stone walls take the
leprosy out your flesh before you speak
 purifying stone walls abate your insolent
license which leads but to idle vanity
the abbot 
and sinful excess and know that what you
now practise is one the profane and unseemly
sports introduced by the priests 
rome themselves to mislead and to brutish
the souls which fell into their net
 marry come up are you there with
your bears muttered the dragon with a
draconic sullenness which was in good
keeping with his character we had as
good have been romans still if we are to
have no freedom in our pastimes 
doest thou reply to me so said sir
halbert glendinning or is there any pastime
in grovelling on the ground there like
a gigantic kail worm get out thy
painted case or by my knighthood i will
treat you like the beast and reptile you have
made yourself
beast and reptile retorted the offended
dragon setting aside your knighthood
i hold myself as well a born man as
thyself
the knight made no answer in words
but bestowed two such blows with the butt
 the abbot
 his lance on the petulant dragon that
had not the hoops which constituted the
ribs the machine been pretty strong they
would hardly have saved those the actor
from being broken in all haste the masquer
crept out his disguise unwilling to
abide a third buffet from the lance the
enraged knight and when the exdragon
stood on the floor the church he presented
to halbert glendinning the wellknown
countenance dan the howletfirst
an ancient comrade his own ere
fate had raised him so high above the rank
to which he was born the clown looked
sulkily upon the knight as if to upbraid
him for his violence towards an old acquaintance
and glendinning's own good
nature reproached him for the violence he
had acted upon him
 i did wrong to strike thee he said
dan but in truth i knew thee not
thou wert ever a mad fellow come to 
castle and we will see how my hawks
fly
the abbot 
and if we shew him not falcons that
will mount as merrily as rockets said the
abbot unreason i would your honour
laid as hard on my bones as you did on his
even now
 how now sir knave said the knight
and what has brought you hither 
the abbot hastily ridding himself the
false nose which mystified his physiognomy
and the supplementary belly which
made up his disguise stood before his master
in his real character adam woodcock
the falconer avenel
how varlet said the knight hast
thou dared to come here and disturb the
very house my brother was dwelling in 
 and it was even for that reason craving
your honour's pardon that i came hir
ther for i heard the country was to be upto
chuse an abbot unreason and sure
thought i i that can sing dance leap
backwards over a broadsword and am as
good a fool as ever sought promotion have
all chance carrying the office and if i
gain my election i may stand his honour's
 the abbot
brother in some stead supposing things fall
roughly out at the kirk saint mary's
 thou art but a cogging knave said
sir halbert and well i wot that love 
ale and brandy besides the humour riot
and frolic would draw thee a mile when
love my house would not bring thee a
yard but go to carry thy roisterers elsewhere
 to the alehouse if they list and
there are crowns to pay your charges 
make out the day's madness without doing
more mischief and be wise men tomorrow
and hereafter learn to serve a good cause
better than by acting like ruffians
obedient to his master's mandate the
falconer was collecting his discouraged followers
and whispering into their ears 
 away away tace is latin for a candle 
never mind the good knight's puritanism
we will play the frolic out over a stand
 double ale in dame martin the brewster's
barn yard draw off harp and tabor
bagpipe and drum mum till you are out
 the churchyard then let the welkin ring
again move on wolf and bear keep the
the abbot 
hind legs till you cross the kirkstyle and
then shew yourselves beasts mettle 
what devil sent him here to spoil our holiday
 but anger him not my heart his
lance is no goose feather as dan's ribs can
tell
 by my soul said dan had it been
another than my ancient comrade i would
have made my father's old fox fly about
his ears 
hush hush man replied adam
woodcock not a word that way as you
value the safety your bones what man 
we must take a clink as it passes so it is not
bestowed in downright illwill
but i will take no such thing said
dan the howletfirst sullenly resisting
the efforts woodcock who was dragging
him out the church when the quick
military eye sir halbert glendinning
detecting roland graeme betwixt his two
guards the knight exclaimed so ho 
falconer woodcock knave hast thou
brought my lady's page in mine own 
the abbot
very to assist at this hopeful revel thine
with your wolves and bears since you
were at such mumming you might if
you would have at least saved the credit
 my household by dressing him up as a
jackannales bring him hither fellows 
adam woodcock was too honest and
downright to permit blame to light upon
the youth when it was undeserved i
swear he said by saint martin bull
lions 
 and what hast thou to do with saint
martin 
nay little enough sir unless when he
sends such rainy days that we cannot fly a
hawk but i say to your worshipful knighthood
that as i am a true man
 as you are a false varlet had been the
better obtestation
 nay if your knighthood allows me not
to speak i can hold my tongue but the
boy came not hither by my bidding for all
that
but to gratify his own malapert pleathe
abbot 
sure i warrant me said sir halbert glendining
 come hither young springald
and tell me whether you have your mistress's
license to be so far absent from the castle
or to dishonour my livery by mingling in
such a maygame 
sir halbert glendinning answered
roland grasme with steadiness i have
obtained the permission or rather the commands
 your lady to dispose my time
hereafter according to my own pleasure i
have been a most unwilling spectator 
this maygame since it is your pleasure so
to call it and i only wear your livery until
i can obtain clothes which bear no such
badge servitude
 how am i to understand this young
man said sir halbert glendinning speak
plainly for i am no reader riddles that
my lady favoured thee i know what hast
thou done to disoblige her and occasion
thy dismissal 
nothing to speak said adam woods
the abbot
cock answering for the boy a foolish
quarrel with me which was more foolishly
told over again to my honoured lady cost
the poor boy his place for my part i
will say freely that i was wrong from beginning
to except about the washing
 the eyass's meat there i stand to it
that i was right
with that the goodnatured falconer
repeated to his master the whole history 
the squabble which had brought poland
graeme into disgrace with his mistress butin
a manner so favourable for the page that
sir halbert could not but suspect his generous
motive
 thou art a goodnatured fellow he
said adam woodcock
 as ever had falcon upon fist said
adam and for that matter so is master
roland but being half a gentleman by
his office his blood is soon up and so is
mine
well said sir halbert be it as it
the abbot 
will my lady has acted hastily for this was
no great matter offence to discard the
lad whom she had trained up for years j
but he i doubt not made it worse by his
prating it jumps well with a purpose however
which i had in my mind draw off
these people woodcock and you roland
grseme attend me
the page followed him in silence into
the abbot's house where stepping into
the first apartment which he found open
he commanded one his attendants to let
his brother master edward glendinning
know that he desired to speak with him
the menatarms went gladly off to join
their comrade adam woodcock and the
jolly crew whom he had assembled at dame
martin's the hostler's wife and the page
and knight were left alone in the apartment
sir halbert glendinning paced the
floor for a moment in silence and then
thus addressed his attendant
thou mayest have remarked stripling
 the abbot
that i have but seldom distinguished thee
by much notice i see thy colour rises but
do not speak till thou hearest me out i
say i have never much distinguished thee
not because i did not see that in thee
which i might well have praised but because
i saw something blameable which
such praises might have made worse thy
mistress dealing according to her pleasure
in her own household as no one hath better
reason or title had picked thee from
the rest and treated thee more like a relation
than a domestic and if thou didst
shew some vanity and petulance under such
distinction it were injustice not to say
that thou hast profited both in thy exercises
and in thy breeding and hast shown
many sparkles a gentle and manly spirit
moreover it were ungenerous having bred
thee up freakish and fiery to dismiss thee
to want or wandering for shewing that very
peevishness and impatience discipline
which arose from thy too delicate nurture
therefore and for the credit my own
the abbot 
household i am determined to retain thee
in my train until i can honourably dispose
 thee elsewhere with a fair prospect 
thy going through the world with credit to
the house that brought thee up
if there was something in sir halbert
glendinning's speech which flattered roland's
pride there was also much that according
to his mode thinking was an
alloy to the compliment and yet his conscience
instantly told him that he ought to
accept with grateful deference the offer
which was made him by the husband his
kind protectress and his prudence however
slender could not but admit he would
enter the world under very different auspices
as a retainer sir halbert blending
so famed for wisdom courage and
influence from those under which he might
partake the wanderings and become an
agent in the visionary schemes for such
they appeared to him magdalen his relative
still a strong reluctance to reenter
 the abbot
a service from which he had been dismissed
with contempt almost counterbalanced
these considerations
sir halbert looked on the youth with
surprise and resumed you seem to hesitate
young man are your own prospects
so inviting that you should pause ere
you accept those which i offer to you t or
must i remind you that although you have
offended your benefactress even to the
point her dismissing you yet i am convinced
the knowledge that you have gone
unguided on your own wild way into a
world so disturbed as ours scotland
cannot in the upshot but give her sorrow
and pain from which it is in gratitude
your duty to preserve her no less than it
is in common wisdom your duty to accept
my offered protection for your own sake
where body and soul are alike endangered
should you refuse it
roland graeme replied in a respectful
tone but at the same time with some spirit
the abbot 
i am not ungrateful for such countenance
as has been afforded me by the lord 
and i am glad to learn for the first
time that i have not had the misfortune to
be utterly beneath his observation as i had
thought and it is only needful to shew
me how i can testify my duty and my gratitude
towards my early and constant benefactress
with my life's hazard and i will
gladly peril it he stopped
these are but words young man answered
glendinning large protestations
are often used to supply the place effectual
service i know nothing in which the
peril your life can serve the lady 
 i can only say she will be pleased to
learn you have adopted some course which
may ensure the safety your person and
the weal your soul what ails you that
you accept not that safety when it is offered
you 
my only relative who is alive answered
roland at least the only relative whom
i have ever seen has rejoined me since i
sc the abbot
was dismissed from the castle avenel 
and i must consult with her whether i can
adopt the line to which you now call me
or whether her encreasing infirmities or the
authority which she is entitled to exercise
over me may not require me to abide with
her
 where is this relation said sir albert
glendinning
in this house answered the page
 go then and seek her out said the
knight avenel more than meet it is
that thou shouldst have her approbation
yet worse than foolish would she shew herself
in denying it
roland left the apartment to seek for his
grandmother and as he retreated the abbot
entered
the two brothers met as brothers who
love each other fondly yet meet rarely together
such indeed was the case their
mutual affection attached them to each
other but in every pursuit habit or sentiment
connected with the discords the
the abbot s
tides the friend and counsellor murray
stood opposed to the roman catholic priest
nor indeed could they have held very much
society together without giving cause 
offence and suspicion to their confederates
on each side after a close embrace on
the part both and a welcome on that
 the abbot sir halbert glendinning expressed
his satisfaction that he had come
in time to appease the riot raised by howhellas
and his tumultuous followers
and yet he said when i look on
your garments brother edward i cannot
help thinking there still remains an abbot
 unreason within the bounds the monastery

and wherefore carp at my garments
brother halbert said the abbot it is
the spiritual armour my calling and as
such beseems me as well as breastplate and
baldric become your own bosom
 ay but there were small wisdom methinks
in putting on armour where we have
vol r p
oi
 the abbot
 power to fight it is but a dangerous
temerity to defy the foe whom wee cannot
resist
for that my brother no one can answer
said the abbot until the battle be
fought and were it even as you say methinks
a brave man though desperate 
victory would rather desire to fight and
fall than to resign sword and shield on some
mean and dishonourable composition with
his insulting antagonist but let not you
and i make discord a theme on which vie
cannot agree but rather stay and partake
though a heretic my admission feast
you need not fear my brother that your
zeal for restoring the primitive discipline
 the church will on this occasion be offended
with the rich profusion a conventual
banquet the days our old friend
abbot boniface are over and the superior
 saint mary's has neither forests nor fishings
woods nor pastures nor cornfields 
neither flocks nor herds bucks nor wildthe
abbot 
fowl granaries wheat nor storehouses
 oil and wine ale and mead the
refectioners office is ended and such a
meal as a hermit in romance can offer to
a wandering knight is all we have to set
before you bat if you will share it with
us we will eat it with a cheerful heart and
thank you my brother for your timely protection
against these rude scoffers
 my dearest brother said the knight
 it grieves me deeply i cannot abide with
you j but it would sound ill for us both were
one the reformed congregation to sit
down at your admission feast and if i can
ever have the satisfaction affording you
effectual protection it will be much owing
to my remaining unsuspected countenancing
or approving your religious rites
and ceremonies it will demand whatever
consideration i can acquire among my own
friends to shelter the bold man who contrary
to law and the edicts parliament
has dared to take up the office abbot 
saint mary's
 the abbot
 trouble not yourself with the task my
brother replied father ambrosius i
would lay down my dearest blood to know
that you defended the church for the
church's sake but while you refrain unhappily
her enemy i would not that you
endangered your own safety or diminished
your own comforts for the sake my individual
protection but who comes hitherto
disturb the few minutes fraternal
communication which our evil fate allows
us
the door the apartment opened as the
abbot spoke and dame magdalen graeme
entered
 who is this woman said sir halbert
glendinning somewhat sternly and what
does she want 
 that you know me not said the ma
tron signifies little i come by your own
order to give my free consent that the
stripling leland graeme return to your
service j and having saidso i cumber you
no longer with my presence peace be with
you she turned to go away but was
the abbot 
stopped by the enquiries sir halbert
glendinning
 who are you what are you and
why do you not await to make me answer 
i was she replied while yet i belonged
to the world a matron no vulgar
name now i am magdalen a poorpilgrim
er for the sake holy kirk
 yea said sir halbert art thou a catholic
 i thought my dame said that roland
graeme came reformed kin
 his father said the matrons was a
heretic or rather one who regarded neither
orthodoxy nor heresy neither the temple
 the church or antichrist i too for
the sins the times make sinners have
seemed to conform to your unhallowed
rites but i had my dispensation and my
absolution
you see brother said sir halbert
with a smile meaning towards his brother
 that we accuse you not altogether
grounds mental equivocation
 my brother you do us injustice rep

 the abhor
plied the abbot this woman as her bearing
may itself warrant you is not in her
perfect mind thanks i must needs say
to the persecution your marauding barons
and your latitudinarian clergy
 i will not dispute the point said sir
halbert the evils the time are unhappily
so numerous that both churches may
divide them and have enow to spare so
saying he leaned from the window the
apartment and winded his bugle
why do you sound your horn my brother
 said the abbot we have spent but
few minutes together
alas said the elder brother and
even these few have been sullied by disagreement
i sound to horse my brother 
the rather that to avert the consequences 
this day's rashness on your part requires
hasty efforts on mine dame you will
oblige me by letting your young relative
know thatwe mount instantly i intend not
that he shall return to avenel with me it
would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and
my household j at least to taunts which his
the abbor 
proud heart could ill brook and my wish
is to do him kindness he shall therefore
go forward to edinburgh with one ray retinue
whom i shall send back to say what
has chanced here you seem rejoiced at
this he added fixing his eyes keenly on
magdalen greene who returned his gaze
with calm indifference
 i would rather she said that roland
a poor and friendless orphan were
the jest the world at large than the
menials at avenel
 fear not dame he shall be scorned
by neither answered the knight
 it may be she replied it may well
be but i will trust more to his own bearing
than to your countenance she iefc
the room as she spoke
the knight looked after her as she departed
but turned instantly to his brother
and expressing in the most affectionate
terms his wishes for his welfare and happiness
craved his leave to depart my
knaves he said are too busy at the 
the abbot
stand to leave their revelry for the empty
breath a bugle horn
you have freed them from higher restraint
halbert answered the abbot and
therein taught them to rebel against your
own
 fear not that edward exclaimed
halbert who never gave his brother his
monastic name ambrosius j none obey
the command real duty so well as those
who are free fiom the observance slavish
bondage
he was turning to depart when the abbot
said let us not yet part brother 
here comes some light refreshment leave
not the house which i must now call mine
till force expel me from it until you have
at least broken bread with me
the poor lay brother the same who acted
as porter now entered the apartment
bearing some simple refreshment and a
flask wine he had found it he said
with officious humility by rummaging
through every nook the cellar
the abbot 
the knight filled a small silver cup and
quaffing it off asked his brother to pledge
him observing the wine was bacharac 
the first vintage and great age
ay said the poor lay brother it
came out the nook which old brother
nicholas may his soul be happy was wont
to call abbot ingram's corner and abbot
ingram was bred at the convent 
wartburg which i understand to be near
where that choice wine grows 
 true my reverend sir said sir haubert
 and therefore i entreat my brother
and you to pledge me in a cup this orthodox
vintage
the thin old porter looked vith a wish
i'll glance towards the abbot do venial
said his superior and the old man
seized with a trembling hand a beverage
to which he had been long unaccustomed
drained the cup with protracted delight as
if dwelling on the flavour and perfume
and set it down with a melancholy smile
and shake the head as if bidding adieu
 the abbot
in future to such delicious potations the
brothers smiled but when sir halbert motioned
to the abbot to take up his cup and
do him reason the abbot in turn shook his
head and replied this is no day for the
abbot saint mary's to eat the fat and
drink the sweet in water from our lady's
well he added filling a cup with the limpid
element i wish you my brother all
happiness and above all a true sight 
your spiritual errors
and to you my beloved edward replied
glendinning wish the free exercise
 your own free reason and the discharge
 more important duties than are
connected with the idle name which you
have so rashly assumed
the brothers parted with deep regret y
and yet each confident in his own opinion
felt somewhat relieved by the absence 
one whom he respected so much and with
whom he could agree so little
soon afterwards the sound the knight
 avenei's trumpets were heard and the
the abbot st
abbot went to the top a tower from
whose dismantled battlements he could
soon see the horsemen ascending the riship
ground in the direction the drawbridge
as he gazed magdalen graeme
came to his side
 thou art come he said to catch
the last glimpse thy grandson my sister
yonder he wends under the charge the
best knight in scotland his faith ever excepted

 thou canst bear witness my father
that it was no vish either mine or roland's
replied the matron which induced
the knight avenel as he is called
again to entertain my grandson in his households
 heaven which confounds the wise
with their own wisdom and the wicked with
their own policy hath placed him wherefor
the service the church i would most
wish him to be
i know not what you mean my sister
said the abbot
reverend father replied magdalen
 hast thou never heard that there are spits
the abbot
its powerful to rend the walls a castle
asunder when once admitted which yet
cannot enter the house unless they are invited
nay dragged over the threshold 
twice hath roland grseme been thus
drawn into the household avenel by
those who now hold the title let them
look to the issue
so saying she left the turret and the
abbot after pausing a moment on her
words which hf imputed to the unsettled
state her mind followed down the winding
stair to celebrate his admission to his
high office by fast and prayer instead 
revelling and thanksgiving

youth i thou dearest to manhood now
darker lip and darker brow
statelier step more pensive mien
in thy face and gait are seen 
thou must now brook midnight watches
take thy food and sport by snatches 
for the gambol and the jest
thou wert wont to love the best
graver follies must thou follow
but as senseless false and hollow
life a poem
young roland gkme now trotted
gaily forward in the train sir halbert glen
dinning he was relieved from his most
galling apprehension the encounter 
the scorn and taunt which might possibly
 the abbot
hail his immediate return to the castle 
avenel there will be a change ere they
see me again he thought to himself i shall
wear the coat plate instead the buff
jerkin and the steel morion for the bonnet
and feather they will be bold that may
venture to break a gibe on the manalarms
for the follies the page and i trust that
ere we return i shall have done something
more worthy note than hallooing a hound
after a deer or scrambling a crag for a kite's
nest he could not indeed help marvelling
that his grandmother with all her religious
prejudices leaning it would seem to
the other side had consented so readily to
his reentering the service the house 
avenel and yet more at the mysterious
joy withvhich she took leave him at the
abbey
 heaven said the dame as she kissed
her young relation and bade him farewell
 works its oyn work even by the hands
 those our enemies who think themselves
the strongest and the wisest thou
the abbot 
my child be ready to act upon the call 
thy religion and country and remember
each earthly bond which thou canst form is
compared to the ties which bind thee to
them like the loose flax to the twisted cable
thou hast not forget the face or form
 the damsel catherine seyton 
roland would have replied in the negative
but the word seemed to stick in his
throat and magdalen continued her exhortations

 thou must not forget her my son and
here i entrust thee with a token which i
trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity
 delivering with care and secrecy into
her own hand
she put here into roland's hand a very
small packet which she again enjoined
him to take the strictest care and to suffer
it to be seen by no one save catherine
seyton who she again unnecessarily reminded
him was the young maiden he had
met on the preceding day she then bec
the abbot
stowed on him her solemn benediction and
bade god speed him
there was something in her manner and
her conduct which implied mystery but
roland graeme was not an age or temper
to waste much time in endeavouring to
decipher her meaning all that was obvious
to his perception in the present journey
promised pleasure and novelty he
rejoiced that he was travelling towards
edinburgh in order to assume the character
 a man and lay aside that a boy he
was delighted to think that he would have
an opportunity rejoiningcatherinesey ton
whose bright eyes and lively manners had
made so favourable an impression on his
imagination and as an inexperienced yet
highspirited youth entering for the first
time upon active life his heart bounded at
the thought that he was about to see all
those scenes courtly splendour and warlike
adventures which the followers 
sir halbert used to boast on their occa
the abbot 
signal visits to avenel to the wonderment
and envy those who like roland knew
courts and camps only by hearsay and
were condemned to the solitary sports and
almost monastic seclusion avenel surrounded
by its lonely lake and embosomed
among its pathless mountains they shall
mention my name he said to himself if
the risk my life can purchase me opportunities
 distinction and catherine seyton's
saucy eye shall rest with more respect
on the distinguished soldier than that with
which she laughed to scorn the raw and inexperienced
page there was wanting but
one accessary to complete the sense rapturous
excitation and he possessed it by
being once more mounted on the back 
a fiery and active horse instead plodding
along on foot as had been the case during
the preceding days
impelled by the liveliness his own spirits
which so many circumstances tended
naturally to exalt roland graeme's voice
and his laughter were soon distinguished
b the abbot
amid the trampling the horses the retinue
and more than once attracted the attention
 their leader who remarked with
satisfaction that the youth replied with
goodhumoured raillery to such the train
as jested with him on his dismissal and return
to the service the house avenel
 i thought the holly branch in your
bonnet had been blighted master roland
said one the menatarms
 only pinched with half an hour's frost 
you see it flourishes as green as ever
 it is too grave a plant to flourish on so
hot a soil as that headpiece thine master
roland gramme retorted the other
who was an old equerry sir halbert
glendinning
 if it will not flourish alone said roland
 i will mix it with the laurel and the
myrtle and i will carry them so near the
sky that it shall make amends for their
stinted growth 
thus speaking he dashed his spurs into
his horse's sides and checking him at the
same time compelled him to execute a lofty
the abbot 
caracole sir halbert glendinning looked
at the demeanour his new attendant with
that sort melancholy pleasure with which
those who have long followed the pursuits
 life and are sensible their vanity regard
the gay young and buoyant spirits
to whom life as yet is only hope and promise

in the meanwhile adam woodcock the
falconer stripped his pasquin habit and
attired according to his rank and calling
in a green jerkin with a bag on the one
side and a short hanger on the other a
glove on his left hand which reached half
vay up his arm and a bonnet and feather
upon his head came after the party as fast
as his active little gallowaynag could trot
and immediately entered into parley with
roland graeme
 so my youngster you are once more
under shadow the holly branch 
c and in case to repay you my good
friend answered roland your ten groats
 silver
a 
 the abbot
 which but an hour since said the
falconer you had nearly paid me with
ten inches steel on my faith it is written
in the our destiny that i must
brook your dagger after all
 nay speak not that my good
friend said the youth i would rather
have broached my own bosom than yours 
but who could have known you in the mumming
dress you wore 
yes the falconer resumed for both
as a poet and actor he had his own professional
share selfconceit i think i was
as good an howleglas as ever played part
at a shrovetide revelry and not a much
worse abbot unreason i defy the old
enemy to unmask me when i chuse to keep
my vizard on what the devil brought the
knight on us before we had the game out
you would have heard me hollo my own
new ballad with a voice should have reached
to berwick but i pray you master
roland be less free cold steel on slight
occasions j for but for the stuffing my
the abbot 
reverend doublet i had only left the kirk
to take my place in the kirkyard
nay spare me that feud said roland
graeme we shall have no time to fight
it out for by our lord's command i am
bound for edinburgh
i know it said adam woodcock
and even therefore we shall have time ta
solder up this rent by the way for sir albert
has appointed me your companion and
guide
ay and with what purpose said
the page
that said the falconer is a question
i cannot answer but i know that bethe
food the ey asses washed or unwashed
and indeed whatsoever becomes 
perch and mew i am to go with you to
edinburgh and see you safely delivered to
the regent at holyrood
 how to the regent said roland in
surprise
 ay by my faith to the regent replied
woodcock j i promise you that if
 the abbot
you are not to enter his service at least
you are to wait upon him in the character
 a retainer our knight avenel
 i know no right said the youth
 which the knight avenel hath to
transfer my service supposing that i owe
it to himself
hush hush said the falconer that
is a question i advise no one to stir in until
he has the mountain or the lake or the
march another kingdom which is better
than either betwixt him and his feudal superior

 but sir halbert glendinning said the
youth is not my feudal superior nor has
he aught authority 
 i pray you my son to rein your
tongue answered adam woodcock my
lord's displeasure if you provoke it will be
worse to appease than my lady's the
touch his least finger were heavier than
her hardest blow and by my faith he is
a man steel as true and as pure but as
hard and as pitiless you remember the
the abbot t
cock capellae whom he hanged over
his gate for a mere mistake a poor yoke
 oxen taken in scotland when he thought
he was taking them in english land i loved
the cock capperlaw the kerr had not
an honest man in their clan and they
have had men that might have been a pattern
to the border men that would not
have lifted under twenty cows at once and
would have held themselves dishonoured if
they had taken a drift sheep or the like
but always managed their raids in full credit
and honour but see his worship halts
and we are close by the bridge ride up
ride up we must have his last instructions

it was as adam woodcock said in the
hollow way descending towards the bridge
which was still in the guardianship peter
bridge ward as he was called though he
was now very old sir halbert glendinning
halted his retinue and beckoned to woodcock
and greene to advance to the head
 the train
 the abbot
 woodcock said he thou knowest
to whom thou art to conduct this youth
and thou young man obey discreetly and
with diligence the orders that shall be
given thee curb thy vain and peevish
temper be just true and faithful and
there is in thee that which may raise thee
many a degree above thy present station
neither shalt thou always supposing thine
efforts to be fair and honest want the protection
and countenance avenel
leaving them in front the bridge
whose centre tower now began to cast a
prolonged shade upon the river the knight
 avenel turned to the left without crossing
the river and pursued his way towards
the chain hills within whose recesses are
situated the lake and castle avenel
there remained behind the falconer roland
graeme and a domestic the knight
 inferior rank who was left with them to
look after their horses while on the road
to carry their baggage and to attend to
their convenience
the abbot 
so soon as the more numerous body 
riders had turned off to pursue their journey
westward those whose route lay across
the river and was directed towards the
north summoned the bridgeward and demanded
a free passage
i will not lower the bridge answered
peter in a voice querulous with age and
illhumour come papist come protestant
ye are all the same the papist threatened
us with purgatory and fleeced us
with pardons the protestant mints at us
with the sword and cuttle us with the liberty
 conscience but the never a one 
either says peter there is your penny i
am well tired all this and for no man
shall the bridge fall that pays me not ready
money and i would have you inow i care
as little for geneva as for rome as little
for homilies as for pardons and the silver
pennies are the only passports i will hear

 here is a proper old chuff said 
title abbot
cock to his companion then raising his
voice he exclaimed hark thee dog 
bridgeward villain doest thou think we
have refused peter's pence to rome to pay
thine at the bridge kennaquhair let
thy bridge down instantly to the followers
 the house avenel or by the hand 
my father and that handled many a bridle
rein for he was a bluff yorkshireman i
say by my father's hand our knight will
blow thee out thy solangoose's nest therein
the middle the water with the light
falconet which we are bringing southward
from edinburgh tomorrow
the bridgeward heard and muttered
 a plague on falcon and falconet on cannon
and demicannon and all the barking
bulldogs whom they halloo against stone
and lime in these our days it was a merry
time when there was little besides handy
blows and it may be a flight arrows
that harmed an ashley wall as little as so
many hailstones but we must jowl and
the abbot it
let the jaw gang by comforting him
self in his state diminished consequence
with this pithy old proverb peter bridgeward
lowered the drawbridge and permitted
them to pass over at the sight his
white hair albeit it discovered a visage
equally peevish through age and misfortune
roland was inclined to give him an alms
but adam woodcock withheld him e'en
let him pay the penalty his former churlishness
and greed he said j the wolf
when he has lost his teeth should be treated
no better than a cur
leaving the bridgeward to lament the
alteration times which sent domineering
soldiers and feudal retainers to his place 
passage instead peaceful pilgrims and
reduced him to become the oppressed instead
 playing the extortioner the travellers
turned them northward and adam
woodcock well acquainted with that part
 the country proposed to cut short a
considerable portion the road by travers
the abbot
sing the little vale glendearg so famous
for the adventures which befel therein during
the earlier part the benedictine's
manuscript with these and with the thousand
commentaries representations and
misrepresentations to which they had given
rise roland graeme was course well
acquainted for in the castle avenel as
well as in other great establishments the
inmates talked nothing so often or with
such pleasure as the private affairs 
their lord and lady but while roland was
viewing with interest these haunted scenes
in which things were said to have passed
beyond the ordinary laws nature adam
woodcock was still regretting in his secret
soul the unfinished revel and the unsung
ballad and kept every now and then breaking
out with some such verses as these 
 the friars fail drank berrybrown ale
the best that ere was tasted 
the monks morose made gude kale
on fridays when they fasted
the abbot 
saint romance sister
the grey priest kist her 
fiend save the company 
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
by my hand friend woodcock said
the page though i know you for a hardy
gospeller that fear neither saint nor devil
yet if i were you i would not sing your
profane songs in this valley glendearg
considering what has happened here before
our time
a straw for your wandering spirits
said adam woodcock i mind them no
more than an earn cares for a string 
wild geese they have all fled since the
pulpits were filled with honest men and the
people's ears with sound doctrine nay i
have a touch at them in my ballad an i
had but had the good luck to have it sung
to j and again he set off in the same
key
from haunted spring and grassy rings
troop goblin elf and fairy 
 the abbot
and the kelpie must flit from the black bogpits
and the brownie must not tarry 
to limbolake
their way they take
with scarce the pith to flee
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
i think he added that could sir albert's
patience have stretched till we came
that length he would have had a hearty
laugh and that is what he seldom enjoys
 if it be all true that men tell his early
life said roland he has less right to
laugh at goblins than most men
 ay i it be all true answered adam
woodcock but who can insure us 
that moreover these were but tales the
monks used to gull us simple laymen withal
 they knew that fairies and hobgoblins
brought aves and paternosters into repute 
but now we have given up worship images
in wood and stone methinks were no
time to be afraid bubbles in the water or
shadows in the air
the abbot 
 but said roland graeme as the catholics
say they do not worship wood or
stone but only as emblems the holy
saints and not as things holy in themselves

 pshaw pshaw answered the falconer
 a rush for their prating they told
us another story when these baptized idols
 theirs brought pikestaves and sandalled
shoon from all the four winds and chilled
the old women out their corn and
their candleends and their butter bacon
wool and cheese and when not so much
as a grey groat escaped tithing
roland graeme had been long taught by
necessity to consider his form religion asa
profound secret and to say nothing whatsoever
in its defence when assailed lest he
should draw on himself the suspicion belonging
to the unpopular and exploded
church he therefore suffered adam woodcock
to triumph without farther opposition
marvelling in his own mind whether any 
the goblins formerly such active agents
 the abbot
would avenge his rude raillery before they
left the valley glendearg but no such
consequences followed they passed the
night quietly in a cottage in the glen and
the next day resumed their route to edinburgh

the abbot s
chapter 
ediiia scotia's darling seat
all hail thy palaces and towers
where once beneath a monarch's feet
sate legislation's sovereign powers
bucks
this then is edinburgh said the
youth as the fellowtravellers arrived at one
 the heights to the southward which commanded
a view the great northern capital
 this is that edinburgh which we
have heard so much 
 even so said the falconer yonder
stands auld reekie you may see the
smoke hover over her at twenty miles distance
as the goeshawk hangs over a plump
 young wildducks ay yonder is the
m the abbot
heart scotland and each throb that she
gives is felt from the edge sol way to
duncan'sbayhead see yonder is the old
castle and see to the right on yon rising
ground that is the castle craigmillar
which i have known a merry place in my
time
 was it not there said the page in a
low voice that the queen held her
court 
ay ay replied the falconer queen
she was then though you must not call her
so now well they may say what they will
i many a true heart will be sad for mary
stuart e'en if all be true men say her
for look you master rolandshe was the
loveliest creature to look upon that i ever
saw with eye and no lady in the land liked
better the fair flight a falcon i was at
the great match on rosinmoor betwixt
bothwell he was a black sight to her
that bothwell and the baron roslin
who could judge a hawk's flight as well as
any man in scotland a butt rhenish
the abbot 
and a ring gold was the wager and it
was flown as fairly for as ever was red gold
and bright wine and to see her there on
her white palfrey that flew as if it scorned
to touch more than the heather blossom 
and to hear her voice as clear and sweet
as the mavis's whistle mix among our jolly
whooping and whistling and to mark all
the nobles dashing round her happiest he
who got a word or look tearing through
moss and hang and venturing neck and
limb to gain the praise a bold rider and
the blink a bonnie queen's bright eye 
she will see little hawking where she lies
now ay ay pomp and pleasure pass away
as speedily as the wap a falcon's wing
 and where is this poor queen now
confined said koland graeme interested
in the fate a woman whose beauty and
grace had made so strong an impression
even on the blunt and careless character 
adam woodcock
 where is she now imprisoned said
adam woodcock why in some castle in
vol b
 the abbot
the north they say know not where for
my part nor is it worth while to vex oneself
anent what cannot be mended an she
had guided her power well whilst she had
it she had not come to so evil a pass men
say she must resign her crown to this little
baby a prince for that they will trust her
with it no longer our master has been as
busy as his neighbours in all this work if
the queen should come to her own again
avenel castle is like to smoke for it unless
he makes his bargain all the better
 in a castle in the north queen mary
is confined said the page
ti why ay they say so at least in a
castle beyond that great river which comes
down yonder and looks like a river but it is
a branch the sea and as bitter as brine
 and amongst all her subjects said the
page with some emotion is there none
that will adventure any thing for her relief

that is a kittle question said the falconer
 and if you ask it often master
the abbot 
roland i am fain to tell you that you will
be mewed up yourself in some those castles
if they do not prefer twisting your
head off to save farther trouble with you 
adventure any thing lord why murray
has the wind in his poop now man and
flies so high and strong that the devil a
wing them can match him no no
there she is and there she must lie till
heaven send her deliverance or till her
son has the management all but murray
will never let her loose again he knows
her too well and hark thee we are now
bound for holyrood where thou wilt find
plenty news and courtiers to tell it 
but take my counsel and keep a calm
sough as the scots say hear every man's
counsel and keep your own and if you
hap to learn any news you like leap not upas
if you were to put on armour direct in
the cause our old mr wingate says and
he knows courtcattle well that if you are
told old king could is come alive again you
should turn it off with and is he in truth 
 the abbot
i heard not it and should seem no
more moved than if one told you by way
 novelty that old king could was dead and
buried wherefore look well to your bearing
master roland for i promise you you
come among a generation that are keen asa
hungry hawk and never be dagger out
 sheath at every wry word you hear spoken
 for you will find as hot blades as yourself
and then will be letting blood without
advice either leech or almanac
 you shall see how staid i will be and
how cautious my good friend said graeme
 but blessed lady what goodly house is
that which is lying all in ruins so close to
the city have they been playing at the
abbot unreason here and ended the
gambol by burning the church 
 there again now replied his companion
 you go down the wind like a wild
haggard that minds neither lure nor beck
that is a question you should have asked
in as low a tone as i shall answer it
if i stay here long said roland
the abbot 
grasme it is like i shall lose the natural
use my voice but what are the ruins
then 
 the kirk field said the falconer
in a low and impressive whisper laying at
the same time his finger on his lip ask
no more about it somebody got foul play
and somebody got the blame it and the
game began there which perhaps may not
be played out in our time poor henry
darnley to be an ass he understood somewhat
 a hawk but they sent him on the
wing through the air himself one bright
moonlight night
the memory this catastrophe was so
recent that the page averted his eyes with
horror from the scathed ruins in which it
had taken place and the accusations
against the queen to which it had given
rise came over his mind with such strength
as to balance the compassion he had begun
to entertain for her present forlorn situation

it was indeed with that agitating state
 the abbot
 mind which arises partly from horror
but more from eager interest and curiosity
that young graeme found himself actually
traversing the scene those tremendous
events the report which had disturbed
the most distant solitudes in scotland like
the echoes distant thunder rolling among
the mountains
now he thought now or never shall i
become a man and bear my part in those
deeds which the simple inhabitants our
hamlets repeat to each other as if they were
wrought by beings a superior race to
their own i will know now wherefore the
knight avenel carries his crest so much
above those the neighbouring baronage
and how it is that men by valour and wisdom
work their way from the hoddin gray
coat to the cloak scarlet and gold men
say i have not much wisdom to recommend
me and if that be true courage must doit
for i will be a man amongst living men
or a dead corpse amongst the dead
from these plans ambition he turned
the abbot 
his thoughts to those pleasure and began
to form many conjectures when and where
he should see catherine seyton and in
what manner their acquaintance was to be
renewed with such conjectures he was
amusing himself when he found that they
had entered the city and all other feelings
were suspended in the sensation giddy
astonishment with which the inhabitant 
a solitary country is affected when for the
first time he finds himself in the streets 
a large and populous city a unit in the
midst thousands
the principal street edinburgh was
then as now one the most spacious in
europe the extreme height the houses
and the variety gothic gables and battlements
and balconies by which the skyline
on each side was crowned and terminated
together with the width the street
itself might have struck with surprise a
more practised eye than that young
graeme the population close packed
within the walls the city and at this time
 the abbot
increased by the number the lords 
the king's party who had thronged to edinburgh
to wait upon the regent murray
absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide
and stately street instead the shopwindows
which are now calculated for the
display goods the traders had their open
booths projecting on the street in which
as in the fashion the modern bazaars all
was exposed which they had upon sale
and though the commodities were not 
the richest kinds yet greene seemed to seethe
wealth the whole world in the various
bales flanders cloths and the specimens
 tapestry and at other places the display
 domestic utensils and pieces silverplate
struck him with wonder the sight 
cutlers booths furnished with swords and
poniards which were manufactured in scotland
and with pieces defensive armour
imported from flanders added to his surprise
 and at every step he found so much
to admire and to gaze upon that adam
woodcock had no little difficulty in prethe
abbot 
wailing on him to advance through such
a scene enchantment
the sight the crowds which filled the
streets was equally a subject wonder
here a gay lady in her muffler or silken
veil traced her way delicately a gentleman
usher making way for her a page
bearing up her train and a waiting gentlewoman
carrying her bible and intimating
that her purpose was towards the church 
there he might see groupe citizens bending
the same way with their short flemish
cloaks wide trowsers and highcaped doublets
a fashion to which as well as to their
bonnet and feather the scots were long
faithful then again came the clergyman
himself in his black geneva cloak and band
lending a grave and attentive ear to the discourse
 several persons who accompanied
him and who were doubtless holding serious
converse on the religious subject he was
about to treat nor did there lack passengers
 a different class and appearance
b 
s the abbot
at every turn roland graeme might see
a gallant ruffle along in the newer or french
mode his doublet slashed and his points
 the same colours with the lining his long
sword on one side and his poniard on the
other behind him a body stout servingmen
proportioned to his estate and quality
all whom walked with the air military
retainers and were armed with sword and
buckler the latter being a small round
shield not unlike the highland target having
a steel spike in the centre two 
these parties each headed by a person 
importance chanced to meet in the very
centre the street or as it was called
 the crown the causeway a post 
honour as tenaciously asserted in scotland
as that giving or taking the wall
used to be in the more southern part the
island the two leaders being equal rank
and most probably either animated by political
dislike or by recollection some
feudal enmity marched close up to each
other without yielding an inch to the right
the abbot 
or the left and neither shewing the least
purpose giving way they stopped for an
instant and then drew their swords their
followers imitated their example about a
score weapons at once flashed in the
sun and there was an immediate clatter 
swords and bucklers while the followers on
either side cried their master's name the
one shouting help a leslie a leslie 
while the others answered with shouts 
seyton seyton with the additional punning
slogan set on set on bear the
knaves to the ground
if the falconer found difficulty in getting
the page to go forward before it was now
perfectly impossible he reined up his
horse clapped his hands and delighted
with the fray cried and shouted as fast as
any those that were actually engaged
in it
the noise and cries thus arising on the
high gait as it was called drew into the
quarrel two or three other parties gentlemen
and their servants besides some single
passengers who hearing a fray betwixt these
 the abbot
two distinguished names took part in it either
for love or hatred
the combat became now very sharp
and although the swordand buckler men
made more clatter and noise than they
did real damage yet several good cuts
were dealt among them and those who
wore rapiers a more formidable weapon
than the ordinary scottish sword gave and
received dangerous wounds two men were
already stretched on the causeway and
the party seyton began to give ground
being much inferior in number to the
other with which several the citizens
had united themselves when young roland
graeme beholding their leader a noble
gentleman fighting bravely and hard
pressed with numbers could withhold no
longer adam woodcock he said an
you be a man draw and let us take part
with the seyton and without waiting a
reply or listening to the falconers earnest
entreaty that he would leave alone a strife
in which he had no concern the fiery youth
sprung from his horse drew his short sword
the abbot 
and shouting like the rest a seyton a
seyton set on set on thrust forward into
the throng and struck down one those
who was pressing hardest upon the gentleman
whose cause he espoused this sudden
reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker
party who began to renew the combat
with much spirit when four the magistrates
 the city distinguished by their
velvet cloaks and gold chains came up with
a guard halberdiers and citizens armed
with long weapons who well accustomed
to such service thrust boldly forward and
compelled the swordsmen to separate who
immediately retreated in different directions
leaving such the wounded on both
sides as had been disabled in the fray lying
on the street
the falconer who had been tearing his
beard for anger at his comrade's rashness
now rode up to him with the horse which
he had caught by the bridle and accosted
him with master roland master goose
master madcap will it please you to
get on horse and budge or will you res
the abbot
main here to be carried to prison and made
to answer for this pretty day's work 
the page who had begun his retreat
along with the seytons just as if he had
been one their natural allies was by this
unceremonious application made sensible
that he was acting a foolish part and
obeying adam woodcock with some sense
 shame he sprung actively on horseback
and upsetting with the shoulder the animal
a cityofficer who was making towards
him he began to ride smartly down the
street along with his companion and was
quickly out the reach the hue and
cry in fact rencounters the kind
were so common in edinburgh at this period
that the disturbance seldom excited
much attention after the affray was over
unless some person consequence chanced
to have fallen an accident which imposed
on his friends the duty avenging
his death upon the first convenient opportunity
so feeble indeed was the arm 
the police that it was not unusual for such
skirmishes to last for hours where the parthe
abbot 
ties were numerous and well matched but
at this time the regent a man great
strength character aware the mischief
which usually arose from such acts violence
had prevailed with the magistrates to
keep a constant guard on foot for preventing
or separating such affrays as had happened
in the present case
the falconer and his young companion
were now riding down the canongate and
had slackened their pace to avoid attracting
attention the rather that there seemed to
be no appearance pursuit roland hung
his head as one who was conscious his conduct
had been none the wisest while his
companion thus addressed him
will you be pleased to tell me one
thing master roland graeme and that is
whether there be a devil incarnate in you
or no 
 truly master adam woodcock answered
the page i would fain hope there
is not
 then said adam i would fain know
 the abbot
by what other influence or instigation you
are perpetually at one or the other 
some bloody brawl what i pray had
you to do with these seytons and leslie
that you never heard the names in your
life before 
you are out there my friend said roland
graeme i have my own reasons for
being a friend to the seytons
 they must have been very secret reasons
then answered adam woodcock
for i think i could have wagered you had
never known one the name and i am
apt to believe still that it was rather your
unhallowed passion for that clashing cold
iron which has as much charm for you as
the clatter a brass pan hath for a hive 
bees more than any care either for seyton
or for leslie that persuaded you to thrust
your fool's head into a quarrel that no ways
concerned you but take this for a warning
my young master that if you are to draw
sword with every man who draws sword
on the highgait here it will be scarce
the abbot 
worth your while to sheathe bilbo again for
the rest your life since if i guess rightly
it will scarce endure on such terms for
many hours all which i leave to your serious
consideration
by my word adam i honour your
advice and i promise you that i will practise
by it as faithfully as if were sworn
apprentice to you to the trade and mystery
 bearing myself with all wisdom and safety
through the new paths life that i am
about to be engaged in
 and therein you will do well said the
falconer and i do not quarrel with you
master roland for having a grain overmuch
spirit because i know one may bring
to the hand a wild hawk which one never
can a dunghill hen and so betwixt two
faults you have the best side on't but besides
your peculiar genius for quarrelling
and lugging out your side companion my
dear master roland you have also the gift
 peering under every woman's muffler and
screen as if you expected to find an old
acquaintance though were you to spy one
 the abbot
i should be as much surprised at it well
wetting how few you have seen these same
wildfowl as i was at your taking so deep
an interest even now in the seyton
 tush man nonsense and folly answered
roland graeme i but sought to
see what eyes these gentle hawks have got
under their hood
ay but it's a dangerous subject inquiry
said the falconer you had better
hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to
perch upon look you master roland
these pretty wildgeese cannot be hawked
at without risk they have as many divines
bolting and villeins as the most
gamesome quarry that falcon ever flew at
and besides every woman them is manned
with her husband or her kind friend
or her brother or her cousin or her sworn
servant at the least but you heed me not
master roland though i know the game
so well your eye is all on that pretty damsel
who trips down the gait before us by
my certes i will warrant her a blithe dancer
either in reel or revel a pair silver
the abbot 
morisco bells would become these pretty
ancles as well as the jesses would suit the
fairest norway hawk
thou art a fool adam said the page
and i care not a button about the girl or
her ancles but what the foul fiend one
must look at something
 very true master roland grime
said his guide but let me pray you to
chuse your objects better look you there
is scarce a woman walks this highgait with
a silk screen or a berlin muffler but as i
said before she has either gentleman usher
before her or kinsman or lover or husband
at her elbow or it may be a brace stout
fellows with sword and buckler not so far
behind but what they can follow close 
but you heed me no more than a mossbank
minds a yellow holding
 o yes i do i do mind you indeed
said roland graeme but hold my nag a
bit i will be with you in the exchange 
a whistle so saying and ere adam woodcock
could finish the sermon which was 
the abbot
ing on his tongue roland graeme to the
falconer's utter astonishment threw him
the bridle his jennet jumped off horseback
and pursued down one the closes
or narrow lanes which opening under a
vault terminate upon the main street the
very maiden to whom his friend had accused
him shewing so much attention and who
had turned down the pass in question
saint mary saint magdalen saint benedict
saint barnabas said the poor falconer
when he found himself thus suddenly
brought to a pause in the midst the
canongate and saw his young charge start
off like a madman in quest a damsel
whom he had never as adam supposed
seen in his life before saint satan
and saint beelzebub for this would make
one swear saint and devil what can have
come over the lad with a wanton and
what shall i do the whilst he will have
his throat cut the poor lad as sure as i
was born at the foot roseberry topping
could find some one to hold the
the abbor 
horses but they are as sharp here northaway
as in canny yorkshire herself and
quit bridle quit pitt as we say an i could
but see one our folks now a holly sprig
were worth a gold tassel or could i but
see one the regent's men but to leave
the horses to a stranger that i cannot 
and to leave the place while the lad is in
jeopardy that i won't
we must leave the falconer however in
the midst his distress and follow the hotheaded
youth who was the cause his perplexity

the latter part adam woodcock's sage
remonstrance had been in a great measure
lost upon roland for whose benefit it was
intended because in one the female
forms which tripped along the street muffled
in a veil striped silk like the women
 brussels at this day his eye had discerned
something which closely resembled the
exquisite shape and spirited bearing catherine
seyton during all the grave advice
which the falconer was dinning into
his ear his eye continued intent upon so
 the abbot
interesting an object observation and
at length as the damsel just about to dive
under one the arched passages which
afford outlet to the canongate from the
houses beneath a passage graced bya projecting
shield arms supported by two
huge foxes stone had lifted her veil for
the purpose perhaps descrying who the
horseman was who for some time had eyed
her so closely young roland saw under
the shadow the silken plaid enough
 the bright azure eyes fair locks and
blithe features to induce him like an inexperienced
and rash madcap whose wilful
ways had never been traversed by contradiction
nor much subjected to consideration
to throw the bridle his horse into
adam woodcock's hand and leave him to
play the waiting gentleman while he dashed
down the paved court after catherine
seyton all as aforesaid
women's wits are proverbially quick but
apparently those catherine suggested no
better expedient than fairly to betake herthe
abbot 
self to speed foot in hopes baffling the
page's vivacity by getting safely lodged before
he could discover where but a youth
 eighteen in pursuit a mistress is not
so easily outstripped catherine fled across
a paved court decorated with large formal
vases stone in which yews cypresses
and other evergreens vegetated in sombre
sullenness and gave a correspondent degree
 solemnity to the high and heavy
building in front which they were placed
as ornaments aspiring towards a square
portion the blue hemisphere corresponding
exactly in extent to the quadrangle in
which they were stationed and all around
which rose huge black walls exhibiting windows
in rows five stories with heavy architraves
over each bearing armorial and religious
devices
through this court catherine seyton
flashed like a hunted doe making the best
use those pretty legs which had attracted
the commendation even the reflective
and cautious adam woodcock she hast
 the abbot
 towards a large door in the centre 
the lower front the court pulled the
bobbin till the latch flew up and ensconced
herself in the ancient mansion but
if she fled like a doe roland graeme followed
with the speed and ardour a youthful
staghound loosed for the first time on
his prey he kept her in view in spite
 her efforts for it is remarkable what
an advantage in such a race the gallant
who desires to see possesses over the maiden
who wishes not to be seen an advantage
which i have known counterbalance
a great start in point distance in short
he saw the waving her screen or veil
at one corner heard the tap her foot
light as that was as it crossed the court and
caught a glimpse her figure just as she
entered the door the mansion
roland graeme inconsiderate and headlong
as w'c have described him having no
knowledge real life but from the romances
which he had read and not an idea 
checking himself in the midst any eager
the abbot 
impulse possessed besides much courage
and readiness never hesitated for a
moment to approach the door through
which the object his search had disappeared
he too pulled the bobbin and
the latch though heavy and massive answered
to the summons and arose the
page entered with the same precipitation
which had marked his whole proceeding
and found himself in a large gloomy hall
or vestibule dimly enlightened by latticed
casements painted glass and rendered
yet dimmer through the exclusion the
sunbeams owing to the height the walls
 those buildings by which the courtyard
was enclosed the walls the hall were
surrounded with suits ancient and rusted
armour interchanged with huge and
massive stone scutcheons bearing double
tressuresfleured and counter fled red wheatsheaves
coronets and so forth things to
which roland graeme gave not a moment's
attention
in fact he only deigned to observe the
vol c
 the abbot
figure catherine seyton who deeming
herself safe in the hall had stopped
to take breath after her course and was
reposing herself for a moment on a large
oaken settle which stood at the upper 
 the hall the noise roland's entrance
at once disturbed her she started up with
a faint scream surprise and escaped
through one the several foldingdoors
which opened into this apartment as a common
centre this door which roland
grasme instantly approached opened on a
large and well lighted gallery at the upper
 which he could hear several voices
and the noise hasty steps approaching
toward the hall or vestibule a little recalled
to sober thought by an appearance 
serious danger he was deliberating whether
he should stand fast or retire when catherine
seyton reentered from a side door
running towards him with as much speed
as a few minutes since she had fled from
him
o what mischief brought you hither 
the abbot 
she said fly fly or you are a dead man
or stay they come flight is impossible
 say you came to ask after lord seyton

she sprung from him and disappeared
through the door by which she had made
her second appearance and at the same
instant a pair large foldingdoors at the
upper the gallery flew open with
vehemence and six or seven young gentlemen
richly dressed pressed forward into
the apartment having for the greater part
their swords drawn
 who is it said one dare intrude onus
in our own mansion 
 cut him to pieces said another let
him pay for this day's insolence and violences
 he is some follower the toties
no by saint mary said another he
i a follower the archfiend and ennobled
clown halbert glendinning who takes the
style avenel once a church vassal now
a pillager the church
 it is so said a fourth i know him
 the abbot
by the holly sprig which is their cognisance
secure the door he must answer
for this insolence
two the gallants hastily drawing their
weapon past on to the door by which roland
had entered the hall and stationed themselves
there as if to prevent his escape the
others advanced on gramme who had just
sense enough to perceive that any attempt
at resistance would be alike fruitless and
imprudent at once and by various voices
none which sounded amicably the page
was required to say who he was whence he
came his name his errand and who sent
him hither the number the questions
demanded him at once afforded a momentary
apology for his remaining silent
and ere that brief truce had elapsed a personage
entered the hall at whose appearance
those who had gathered fiercely around
roland fell back with respect
this was a tall man whose dark hair was
already grizzled though his eye and haughty
features retained all the animation 
the abbot 
youth the upper part his person was
undressed to his holland shirt whose ample
folds were stained with blood but he
wore a mantle crimson lined with rich
fur cast around him which supplied the deficiency
 his dress on his head he had
a crimson velvet bonnet looped up on one
side with a small golden chain many
links which going thrice round the hat was
fastened by a medal agreeable to the fashion
amongst the grandees the time
whom have you here sons and kinsmen
said he around whom you crowd
thus roughly know you not that the shelter
 this roof should secure every one fair
treatment who shall come hither either in
fair peace or in open and manly hostility 
 but here my lord answered one 
the youths sis a knave who comes on treacherous
espial 
i deny the charge said roland grime
boldly i came to inquire after my lord
seyton
 a likely tale answered his accusers
 the abbot
in the mouth a follower blending

 stay young men said the lord seyton
for it was that nobleman himself let
me look at this youth by heaven it is the
very same who came so boldly to my side
not very many minutes since when some 
my own knaves bore themselves with more
respect to their own worshipful safety than
to mine stand back from him for he well
deserves honour and a friendly welcome at
your handsjinstead this rough treatment
they fell back on all sides obedient to
lord seyton's commands who taking roland
grasme by the hand thanked him for
his prompt and gallant assistance adding
that he nothing doubted the same interest
which he had taken in his cause in the
affray brought him hither to inquire after
his hurt
roland bowed low in acquiescence
 or is there any thing in which i can
serve you to shew my sense your ready
gallantry
the abbot 
bat the page thinking it best to abide by
the apology for his visit which the lord
seyton had so aptly himself suggested replied
 that to be assured his lordship's
safety had been the only cause his intrusion
he judged he added he had
seen him receive some hurt in the affray
 a trifle said lord seyton i had but
stripped my doublet that the chirurgeon
might put some dressing on the paltry
scratch when these rash boys interrupted
us with their clamour
roland graeme making a low obeisance
was now about to depart for relieved from
the danger being treated as a spy he began
next to fear that his companion adam
woodcock whom he had so unceremoniously
quitted would either bring him into
some farther dilemma by venturing into
the hotel in quest him or ride offend leave
him behind altogether but lord seyton did
not permit him to escape so easily tarry
he said young man and let me know
thy rank and name the seyton has late
 the abbot
been more wont to see friends and followers
shrink from his side than to receive aid
from strangers but a new world may come
round in which he may have the chance 
rewarding his well wishers
my name is roland graeme my lord
answered the youth a page who for the
present is in the service sir halbert
glendinning
 i said so from the first said one the
young men my ife i will wager that this
is a shaft out the heretic's quiver a stratagem
from first to last to injeer into your
confidence some espial his own they
know how to teach both boys and women
to play the intelligencers
 that is false if it be spoken me
said roland no man in scotland should
teach me such a foul part 
i believe thee boy said seyton for
thy strokes were too fair to be dealt upon
an understanding with those that were to
receive them credit me however i little
expected to have help at need from one 
the abbot 
your master's household and i would know
what moved thee in my quarrel to shine
own endangering 
 so please you my lord said roland
i think my master himself would not have
stood by and seen an honourable man borne
to earth by odds if his single arm could
help him such at least is the lesson we
were taught in chivalry at the castle 
avenel
 the good seed hath fallen into good
ground young man said seyton but
alas if thou practise such honourable war
in these dishonourable days when right is
every where borne down by mastery thy
life my poor boy will be but a short one
 let it be short so it be honourable
said roland graeme and permit me now
my lord to commend me to your grace and
to take my leave a comrade waits with
my horse in the street
take this however young man said
lord seyton undoing from his bonnet the
c
 the abbot
golden chain and medal and wear it for
my sake
with no little pride roland greene accepted
the gift which he hastily fastened
around his bonnet as he had seen gallants
wear such an ornament and renewing his
obeisance to the baron left the hall traversed
the court and appeared in the street
just as adam woodcock vexed and anxious
at his delay had determined to leave the
horses to their fate and go in quest his
youthful comrade whose barn hast thou
broken next he exclaimed greatly relieved
by his appearance although his countenance
indicated that he had passed through
an agitating scene
 ask me no questions said roland
leaping gaily on his horse j but see how
short time it takes to win a chain gold
pointing to that which he now wore
 now god forbid that thou hast either
stolen it or reft it by violence said the
falconer for otherwise i wot not how
the abbot 
the devil thou couldst compass it i have
been often here ay for months at an 
and no one gave me either chain or medal

 thou seest i have got one on shorter
acquaintance with the city answered the
page and set thine honest heart at rest 
that which is fairly won and freely given
is neither reft nor stolen
 marry hang thee with thy fanfarona
about thy neck said the falconer i
think water will not drown nor hemp strangle
thee thou hast been discarded as
my lady's page to come in again as my
lord's squire and for following a noble
young damsel into some great household
thou gets a chain and a medal where another
would have had the baton across his
shoulders if he missed having the dirk in
a name given to the gold chains worn by the military
men the period it is spanish origin for
the fashion wearing these costly ornaments was
much followed amongst the conquerors the ney
world
 the abbot
his body but here we come in front 
the old abbey bear thy good luck with
you when you cross these paved stones
and by our lady you may brag scotland
as he spoke they checked their horses
where the huge old vaulted entrance to
the abbey or palace holyrood crossed
the termination the street down which
they had proceeded the courtyard 
the palace opened within this gloomy porch
shewing the front an irregular pile 
monastic buildings one wing which is
still extant forming a part the modern
palace erected in the days charles i
at the gate the porch the falconer
and page resigned their horses to the 
in attendance the falconer commanding
him with an air authority to
carry them safely to the stables we follows
he said the knight avenel ave
must bear ourselves for what we are here
said he in a whisper to roland for everyone
here ig looked on as they demean themselves
 and he that is too modest must to
the abbor 
the wall as the proverb says therefore
cock thy bonnet man and let us brook the
causeway bravely
assuming therefore an air consequence
corresponding to what he supposed
to be his master's importance and quality
adam woodcock led the way into the courtyard
 the palace holyrood
 the abbot
chapter iii
the sky is clouded gaspard
and the vex'd ocean sleeps a troubled sleep
beneath a lurid gleam parting sunshine
such slumber hangs o'er discontented lands
while factions doubt as yet if they have strength
to front the open battle
albion a poem
the youthful page paused on the entrance
 the courtyard and implored his guide
to give him a moment's breathing space
 let me but look around me man said
he you consider not i have never seen
such a scene as this before and this is 
 the resort the gallant and gay
and the fair and the wise and the powerful

ay marry is it said woodcock 
but i wish i could hood thee as they do
the hawks for thou stares as wildly as if
s
the abbot 
you sought another fray or another fanfa
roma i would i had thee safely housed
for thou loosest wild as a goeshawk
it was indeed no common sight to roland
the vestibule a palace traversed by
its various groupes some radiant with
gaiety some pensive and apparently weighed
down by affairs concerning the state
or concerning themselves here the hoary
statesman with his cautious yet commanding
look his furred cloak and sable pantoufles
j there the soldier in buff and steel his
long sword jarring against the pavement and
his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow 
there again passed my lord's servingman
high heart and bloody hand humble
to his master and his master's equals insolent
to all others to these might be added
the poor suitor with his anxious look
and depressed mien the officer full his
brief authority elbowing his betters and
possibly his benefactors out the road 
the proud priest who sought a better benefice
 the proud baron who sought a grant
 the abbot
 church lands the robber chief who came
to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had
inflicted on his neighbours the plundered
franklin who came to seek vengeance for
that which he had himself received besides
there was the mustering and disposition
 guards and soldiers the dispatching
 messengers and the receiving them
the trampling and neighing horses
without the gate the flashing arms and
rustling plumes and jingling spurs
within it in short it was that gay and
splendid confusion in which the eye 
youth sees all that is brave and brilliant and
that experience much that is doubtful
deceitful false and hollow hopes that will
never be gratified promises which will never
be fulfilled pride in the disguise 
humility and insolence in that frank
and generous bounty
as tired the eager and enraptured
attention which the page gave to a scene
so new to him adam woodcock endeavoured
to get him to move forward bethe
abbot 
fore his exuberance astonishment should
attract the observation the sharpwitted
denizens the court the falconer himself
became an object attention to a gay menial
in a darkgreen bonnet and feather with
a cloak a corresponding colour laid down
as the phrase then went by six broad bars 
silver lace and welted with violet and silver
the words recognition burst from
both at once what adam woodcock
at court and what michael 
 and how runs the hackit greyhound
bitch now 
the war for the wear like ourselves
adam eight years this grass no four legs
will carry a dog for ever j but we keep her
for the breed and so she scapes borderdoom
 but why stand you gazing there 
i promise you my lord has wished for you
and asked for you
 my lord murray asked for me and
he regent the kingdom too said adam
i hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my
good lord but i fancy his good lordship
remembers the day's sport on carnwarth
 the abbot
moor and my drummelzier falcon that
beat the hawks from the isle man and
won his lordship a hundred crowns from
the southern baron whom they called stanley

nay not to flatter thee adam said
his courtfriend he remembers nought 
thee or thy falcon either he hath flown
many a higher flight since that and struck
his quarry too but come come hither
away i trust we are to be good comrades
on the old score
what said adam you would have
me crash a pot with you but i must first
dispose my eyass where he will neither
have girl to chase or lad to draw sword
upon
is the youngster such a one said michael

ay by my hood he flies at all game
replied woodcock
then had he better come with us said
michael wingthewind for we cannot
have a proper carouse just now only i
would wet my hps and so must you i want
the abbot 
to hear the news from saint mary's before
you see my lord and i will let you know
how the wind sits up yonder
while he thus spoke he led the way
to a side door which opened into the
court and threading several dark passages
with the air one who knew the
most secret recesses the palace conducted
them to a small matted chamber where
he placed bread and cheese and a foaming
flagon ale before the falconer who
immediately did justice to the latter ina
hearty draught which nearly emptied
the measure having drawn his breath
and dashed the froth from his whiskers he
observed that his anxiety for the boy had
made him deadly dry
 mend your draught said his hospitable
friend again supplying the flagon from
a pitcher which stood beside i know the
way to the butterybar and now mind
what i say this morning the earl morton
came to my lord in a mighty chafe
what they keep the old friendship
then said woodcock
 the abbot
ay ay man what else said michael
 one hand must scratch the other
but in a mighty chafe was my lord morton
who to say truth looketh on such occasions
altogether uncanny and as it were
fiendish and he says to my lord for i was
in the chamber taking orders about a cast
 hawks that are to be fetched from darnway
 they match your long winged falcons
friend adam
 i will believe that when i see them fly
as high a pitch replied woodcock this
professional observation forming a sort 
parenthesis
 however said michael pursuing his
tale my lord morton in a mighty
chafe asked my lord regent whether he
was well dealt with for my brother said
he should have had a gift to be commendator
 kennaquhair and to have all the
temporalities erected into a lordship regality
for his benefit and here said he
the false monks have had the insolence to
chuse a new abbot to put his claim in my
brother's way j and moreover the rascality
the abbot 
 the neighbourhood have burnt and plundered
all that was left in the abbey so that
tiny brother will not have a house to dwell
in when he hath ousted the lazy hounds 
priests and my lord seeing him chafed said
mildly to him these are shrewd tidings
douglass but i trust they be not true for
halbert glendinning went southward yesterday
with a band spears and assuredly
had either these chances happened that
the monks had presumed to chuse an abbot
or that the abbey had been burnt as
you say he had taken order on the spot for
the punishment such insolence and had
dispatched us a messenger and the earl
 morton replied now i pray you adam
to notice that i say this out love to you
and your lord and also for old comradeship
and also because sir halbert hath
done me good and may again and also
because i love not the earl morton as
indeed more fear than like him so then it
were a foul deed in you to betray me but
said the earl to the regent take heed my
lord you trust not this glendinning too
 the abbot
far he comes churl's blood which was
never true to the nobles by saint andrew
these were his very words and besides
he said he hath a brother a monk in saint
mary's and walks all by his guidance and
is making friends on the border with buck
and with fernieherst and will join
hand with them were there likelihood a
new world and my lord answered like a
free noble lord as he is tush my lord
 morton i will be warrant for blending
faith and for his brother he is a
dreamer that thinks nought but 
and breviary and if such hap have chanced
as you tell i look to receive from glendining
the cowl a hanged monk and
the head a riotous churl by way sharp
and sudden justice and my lord morton
left the place and as it seemed tome
somewhat malcontent but since that
time iii lord has asked me more than
once whether there has arrived no messenger
from the knight avenel and all this
i have told you that you may frame your
the abbot 
discourse to the best purpose for it seems
to me that my lord will not be well pleased
if aught has happened like what my
lord morton said and if your lord hath
not ta'en strict orders with it
there was something in this communication
which fairly blanked the bold visage
 adam woodcock in spite the reinforcement
which his natural hardihood had
received from the berry brown ale holyrood

 what was it he said about a churl's
head that grim lord morton said the
discontented falconer to his friend
nay it was my lord regent who
said that he expected if the abbey was injured
your knight would send him the head
 the ringleader among the rioters
 nay but is this done like a good protestant
said adam woodcock or a true
lord the congregation we used to be
their whiteboys and darlings when we pulled
down the convents in fife and perthshires

 the abbot
 ay but that said michael was
when old mother rome held her own and
her great folks were determined she should
have no shelter for her head in scotland
bat now that the priests are fled in all quarters
and their houses and lands are given
to our grandees they cannot see that weare
working the work reformation in destroying
the palaces zealous protestants

but i tell you saint mary's is not destroyed
 said woodcock in increasing agitation
 some trash painted windows
there were broken things that no nobleman
could have brooked in his housesome
stone saints were brought on their
marrowbones like old warrington at
chevychace but as for fire raising there
was not so much as a lighted lunt amongst
us save the match which the dragon had to
light the burning tow withal which he was
to spit against saint george nay i had
caution that
 how adam woodcock said his comthe
abbot s
rade i trust thou hadst no hand in such
a fair work look you adam i were loth
to terrify you and you just come from a
journey but i promise you earl morton
hath brought you down a maiden from halifax
you never saw the like her and
shell clip you round the neck and your
head will remain in her arms
pshaw answered adam i am too
old to have my head turned by any maiden
 them all i know my lord morton
will go as far for a buxom lass as any one 
but what the devil took him to halifax all
the way and if he have got a gamester
there what hath she to do with my head 
 much much answered michael
 herod's daughter who did such execution
with her foot and ancle danced not
raen'sheads offmore cleanly than this maidens
 morton tis an axe man an axe which
falls itself like a sash window and never
gives the headsman the trouble to wield it
 by my faith a shrewd device said
woodcock j heaven keep us free on't 
vol d
 the abbot
the page seeing no to the conversation
between these two old comrades and
anxious from what he had heard concerning
the fate the abbot now interrupted
their conference
methinks he said adam woodcock
thou hadst better deliver thy master's
letter to the regent questionless he
hath therein stated what has chanced at
kennaquhair in the way most advantageous
for all concerned
the boy is right said michael 
 my lord will be very impatient

 the child hath wit enough to keep
himself warm said adam woodcock producing
from his hawkingbag his lord's
letter addressed to the earl murray
 and for that matter so have i so master
roland you will e'en please to present
this yourself to the lord regent his presence
will be better graced by a young
page than by an old falconer
well said canny yorkshire replied
the abbot 
his friend and but now you were so earnest
to see our good lord why wouldst
thou put the lad into the noose that thou
may est slip tether thyself or doest thou
think the maiden will clasp his fair young
neck more willingly than thy old sunburnt
weasand 
 go to answered the falconer thy
wit towers high an it could strike the quarry
i tell thee the youth has nought to fear
he had nothing to do with the gambol 
a rare gambol it was michael as madcaps
ever played and i had made as rare a ballad
if we had had the luck to get it sung to
an but mum for that tace as i said
before is latin for a candle carry the
youth to the presence and i will remain
here with bridle in hand ready to strike
the spurs up to the rowelheads in case the
hawk flies my way i will soon put soltra
edge i trow betwixt the regent and me if
he means me less than fair play
come on then my lad said michael
 since thou must needs take the spring bec
the abbot
fore canny yorkshire so saying he led
the way through winding passages closely
followed by roland graeme until they arrived
at a large winding stone stair the
steps which were so long and broad and
at the same time so low as to render the
ascent uncommonly easy when they had
ascended about the height one storey
the guide stepped aside and pushed open
the door a dark and gloomy antichamber
 so dark indeed that his youthful companion
stumbled and nearly fell down
upon a low step which was awkwardly placed
on the very threshold
take heed said michael wingshewing
in a very low tone voice and first
glancing cautiously round to see if any one
listened take heed my young friend
for those who fall on these boards seldom
arise again seest thou that he added ina
still lower voice pointing to some dark
crimson stains on the floor on which a ray
 light shot through a small aperture and
traversing the general gloom the apartthe
abbot 
ment fell with mottled radiance seest
thou that youth walk warily for men have
fallen here before you
 what mean you said the page his
flesh creeping though he scarce knew why 
 is it blood 
ay ay said the domestic in the
same whispering tone and dragging the
youth on by the arm blood it is but
this is no time to question or even to look
at it blood it is foully and fearfully shed
as foully and fearfully avenged the
blood he added in a still more cautious
tone seignior david
koland greeme's heart throbbed when
he found himself so unexpectedly in the
scene rizzio's slaughter a catastrophe
which had chilled with horror all even
in that rude age which had been the theme
 wonder and pity through every cottage
and castle in scotland and had not escaped
that avenel but his guide hurried
him forward permitting no further
question and with the manner one
who has already tampered too much with
 the abbot
a dangerous subject a tap which he made
at a low door at one the vestibule
was answered by a huissier or usher who
opening it cautiously received michael's
intimation that a page waited the regent's
leisure who brought letters from the knight
 avenel
 the council is breaking up said the
usher but give me the packet his grace
the regent will presently see the messenger

 the packet replied the page must
be delivered into the regent's own hands 
such were the orders my master
the usher looked at him from head to
foot as if surprised at his boldness and then
replied with some asperity say you so
my young master thou lowest loudly to
be but a chicken and from a country barnyard
too
were it a time or place said roland
 thou shouldst see i can do more than
crow but do your duty and let the regent
know i wait his pleasure
the abbot 
 thou art but a pert knave to tell me
 my duty said the courtier in office but
i will find a time to shew you you are out
 yours meanwhile wait there till you are
wanted so saying he shut the door in
roland's face
michael wingthewind who had shrunk
from his youthful companion during this
altercation according to the established
maxim courtiers all ranks and in ail
ages now transgressed their prudential line
 conduct so far as to come up to him once
more thou art a hopeful young springaid
said he and i see right well old
yorkshire had reason in his caution thou
hast been five minutes in the court and
hast employed thy time so well as to make
a powerful and a mortal enemy out the
usher the councilchamber why man
you might almost as well have offended the
deputy butler
i care not what he is said roland
gramme i will teach whomsoever i speak
with to speak civilly to me in return i
 the abbot
did not come from avenel to be browbeaten
in holyrood
bravo my lad said michael j it is a
fine spirit if you can but hold it but seethe
door opens
the usher appeared and in a more civil
tone voice and manner said that his
grace the regent would receive the knight
 avenel's message and accordingly marshalled
roland graeme the way into the
apartment from which the council had
been just dismissed after finishing their consultations
there was in the room a long
oaken table surrounded by stools the
same wood with a large elbow chair covered
with crimson velvet at the head writing
materials and papers were lying therein
apparent disorder and one or two 
the privy counsellors who had lingered behind
assuming their cloaks bonnets and
swords and bidding farewell to the regent
were departing slowly by a large door on
the opposite side to that through which the
page entered apparently the earl murthe
abbot 
ray had made some jest for the smiling countenances
 the statesmen expressed that sort
 cordial reception which is paid by courtiers
to the condescending pleasantries a
prince
the regent himself was laughing heartily
as he said farewell my lords and hold
me remembered to the cock the north
he then turned slowly round towards
roland greene and the marks gaiety
real or assumed disappeared from his countenance
as completely as the passing bubbles
leave the dark mirror a still profound
lake into which a traveller has cast a stone 
in the course a minute his noble fear
lures had assumed their natural expression
 deep and even melancholy gravity
this distinguished statesman for as such
his worst enemies acknowledged him possessed
all the external dignity as well as almost
all the noble qualities which could
grace the power that he enjoyed j and had
he succeeded to the throne ashes legitimate
inheritance it is probable he would have
d f
 the abbot
been recorded as one scotland's wisest
and greatest kings but that he held his
authority by the deposition and imprisonment
 his sister and benefactress was a
crime which those only can excuse who
think ambition an apology for ingratitude
he was dressed plainly in black velvet after
the flemish fashion and wore in his
highcrowned hat a jewelled clasp which
looped it up on one side and formed the
only ornament his apparel he had his
poniard by his side and his sword lay on
the council table
such was the personage before whom
roland graeme now presented himself with
a feeling breathless awe very different
from the usual boldness and vivacity his
temper in fact he was from education and
nature forward but not impudent and was
much more easily controuled by the moral
superiority arising from the elevated talents
and renown those with whom he
conversed than pretensions founded only
on rank or external shew he might have
braved with indifference the presence an
the abbot 
earl merely distinguished by his belt and
coronet but he felt overawed in that the
eminent soldier and statesman the wielder
 a nation's power and the leader her
armies the greatest and wisest are flattered
by the deference youth so graceful
and becoming in itself and murray
took with much courtesy the letter from
the hands the abashed and blushing page
and answered with complaisance to the imperfect
and halfmuttered greeting which
he endeavoured to deliver to him on the
part sir halbert avenel he even
paused a moment ere he broke the silk
with which the letter was secured to ask
the page his name so much he was struck
with his very handsome features and form
 roland graeme he said repeating the
words after the hesitating page what 
the grahame the lennox 
no may lord replied roland my
parents dwelt in the debateable land
murray made no farther enquiry but
proceeded to read his dispatches during
the perusal which his brow began to ask
the abbot
some a stern expression displeasure as
that one who found something which at
once surprised and disturbed him he
sate down on the nearest seat frowned
till his eyebrows almost met together read
the letter twice over and was then silent
for several minutes at length raising
his head his eye encountered that the
usher who in vain endeavoured to exchange
the look eager and curious observation
with which he had been perusing the regent's
features for that open and noticing
expression countenance which in
looking at all seems as if it saw and marked
nothing a cast look which may be
practised with advantage by all those 
whatsoever degree who are admitted to
witness the familiar and unguarded hours
 their superiors great men are as jealous
 their thoughts as the wife king
candles was her charms and will as
readily punish those who have however
involuntarily beheld them in mental deshabille
and exposure
leave the apartment hyndman said
the abbot 
the regent sternly and carry your observation
elsewhere you are too knowing
sir for your post which by special order
is destined for men blunter capacity so 
now you look more like a fool than you did
for hyndman as may easily be supposed
was not a little discouraged by this rebuke
 keep that confused stare and it
may keep you your office begone sir 
the usher departed in dismay not forgetting
to register amongst his other causes
 dislike to roland graeme that he had
been the witness this disgraceful chiding
when he had left the apartment the regent
again addressed the page
 your name you say is armstrong 
 no replied roland my name is
graeme so please you roland graeme
whose forbears were designated heathergill
in the debateable land
 ay i knew it was a name from the
debateable land hast thou any acquaintances
here in edinburgh 
 my lord replied roland willing rash
the abbot
ther to evade this question than to answer
it directly for the prudence being silent
with respect to lord seyton's adventure
immediately struck him i have been in
edinburgh scarce an hour and that for the
first time in my life
 what and thou sir halbert blending
page said the regent
i was brought up as my lady's page
said the youth and left avenel castle for
the first time in my life at least since my
childhood only three days since
my lady's page repeated the earl
 murray as if speaking to himself it
was strange to send his lady's page on a
matter such deep concernment morton
will say it is a piece with the nomination
 his brother to be abbot and yet in some
sort an inexperienced youth will best serve
the turn what hast thou been taught
young man in thy doughty apprenticeship

 to hunt my lord and to hawk said
roland graeme
the abbot 
 to hunt coneys and to hawk at ouzel
said the regent smiling for such
are the sports ladies and their followers
graeme's cheek reddened deeply as he
replied not without some emphasis to
hunt red deer the first head and to
strike down herons the highest soar my
lord which in lothian speech may be
termed for aught i know coneys and ouzel
 also i can wield a brand and couch
a lance according to our border meaning 
in inland speech these may be termed 
and bullrushes
thy speech rings like metal said the
regent and i pardon the sharpness it
for the truth thou knowest then what
belongs to the duty a manatarms
so far as exercise can teach it without
real service in the field answered roland
grme but our knight permitted none
 his household to make raids and i never
had the good fortune to see a stricken
field
 the good fortune repeated the res
the abbot
gent smiling somewhat sorrowfully take
my word young man war is the only game
from which both parties rise losers
not always my lord answered the
page with his characteristic audacity if
fame speaks truth
 how sir said the regent colouring
in his turn and perhaps suspecting an
indiscreet allusion to the height which he
himself had attained by the hap civil war
because my lord said roland graeme
without change tone she who fights well
must have fame in life or honour in death 
and so war is a game from which no one
can rise a losers
the regent smiled and shook his head
when at that moment the door opened and
the earl morton presented himself
i come somewhat hastily he said and
i enter unannounced because my news are
 weight it is as i said edward glendining
is named abbot and
 hush my lord said the regent i
know it but
the abbot 
and perhaps you knew it before i did
my lord murray answered morton his
dark red brow growing darker and redder
as he spoke
 morton said murray suspect me
not touch not mine honour i have to
suffer enough from the calumnies foes
let me not have to contend with the unjust
suspicions my friends we are not
alone said he recollecting himself or i
gould tell you more
he led morton into one the deep
embrasures which the windows formed in
the massive wall and which afforded a retiring
place for their conversing apart in
this recess roland observed them speak
together with much earnestness murray
appearing to be grave and earnest and
morton having a jealous and offended air
which seemed gradually to give way to the
assurances the regent
as their conversation grew more earnest
they became gradually louder in speech
having perhaps forgotten the presence 
 the abbot
the page the more readily as his position
in the apartment placed him out sight
so that he found himself unwillingly privy
to more their discourse than he cared to
hear for page though he was a mean
curiosity after the secrets others had never
been numbered amongst roland's failings
 and moreover with all his natural
rashness he could not but doubt the safety
 becoming privy to the secret discourse
 these powerful and dreaded men still he
could neither stop hisearsnorwithpropriety
leave the apartment j and while he thought
 some means signifying his presence
he had already heard so much that to have
produced himself suddenly would have been
as awkward and perhaps as dangerous as
in quiet to abide the their conference
what he overheard however was
but an imperfect part their communication
 and although a more expert politician
acquainted with the circumstances 
the times would have had little difficulty in
tracing the meaning yet roland graeme
the abbot 
could only form very general and vague
conjectures as to the import their discourse

 all is prepared said murray and
lindesay is setting forward she must hesitate
no longer thou seest i act by thy
counsel and harden myself against softer
considerations
true my lord replied morton in
what is necessary to gain power you do not
hesitate but go boldly to the mark bat
are you as careful to defend and preserve
what you have won why this establishment
 domestics around her has not
your mother men and maidens enough to
tend her but you must consent to this superfluous
and dangerous retinue 
for shame morton a princess and
my sister could i do less than allow her due
tendance 
ay replied morton even thus fly
all your shafts smartly enough loosened
from the bow and not unskilfully aimed
but a breath foolish affection ever crosses
 the abbot
in the mid volley and sways the arrow from
the mark
say not so morton replied murray
i have both dared and done
yes enough to gain but not enough to
keep reckon not that she will think and
act thus you have wounded her deeply
both in pride and in power it signifies
nought that you would tent now the wound
with unavailing salves as matters stand
with you you must forfeit the title an
affectionate brother to hold that a bold
and determined statesman
 morton said murray with some impatience
 i brook not these taunts what
i have done i have done what i must further
do i must and will but i am not
made iron like thee and i cannot but
remember enough thismy purpose
holds
and i warrant me said morton the
choice these domestic consolations will
rest with 
here he whispered names which escaped
the abbot 
roland graeme's ear murray replied in a
similar tone but so much raised towards
the conclusion the sentence that the
page heard these words and him i
hold myself secure by glendinning's recommendation

ay which may be as much trustworthy
as his late conduct at the abbey 
saint mary's you have heard his brother's
election has taken place your favourite
sir halbert my lord murray has as
much fraternal affection as yourself
by heaven morton that taunt demanded
an unfriendly answer but i pardon it for
your brother also is concerned but this
election shall be annulled i tell you earl
 morton while i hold the sword state
in my royal nephew's name neither lord nor
knight in scotland shall dispute my authority
 and if i bear with insults from my
friends it is only while i know them to be
such and forgive their follies for their faithfulness

morton muttered what seemed to be
 the abbot
some excuse and the regent answered him
in a milder tone and then subjoined besides
i have a pledge besides glendinning's
recommendation for this youth's fidelity
his nearest relative has placed herself in my
hands as his security to be dealt withal as
his doings shall deserve
that is something replied morton 
 but yet in fair love and good will i must
still pray you to keep on your guard the
foes are stirring again as horseflies and
hornets become busy so soon as the stormblast
is over george seyton was cropping
the causeway this morning with a score
 men at his back and had a ruffle with
my friends the house leslie they
met at the trone and were fighting hard
when the provost with his guard partizans
came in thirdsman and staved them
asunder with their halberds as men part
dog and bear
he hath my order for such interference
said the regent has any one
been hurt 
the abbot 
 george seyton himself by black
ralph leslie the devil take the rapier that
ran not through from side to side ralph
has a bloody coxcomb by a blow from a
messanpage whom nobody knew dick
seyton windygowl is run through the
arm and two gallants the leslie have
suffered phlebotomy this is all the gentle
blood which has been spilled in the revel 
but a yeoman or two on both sides have
had bones broken and ears cropped the
ostlerwives who are like to be the only
losers by their miscarriage have dragged
the knaves off the street and are crying a
drunken coronach over them
 you take it lightly douglas said the
regent these broils and feuds would
shame the capital the great turk let
alone that a christian and reformed state
but if i live this gear shall be amended 
and men shall say when they read my story
that if it were my cruel hap to rise to power
by the dethronement a sister i employed
it when gained for the benefit the commonweal

 the abbot
and your friends replied morton j
wherefore i trust for your instant order
annulling the election this lurdane abbot
edward glendinning
 you shall be presently satisfied and
stepping forward he began to call soho
hyndman when suddenly his eye
lighted on roland graeme by my faith
douglas said he turning to his friend
here have been three at counsel
ay but only two can keep counsel
said morton the galliard must be disposed

 for shame morton an orphan boy 
hearken thee my child thou hast told
me some thy accomplishments canst
thou speak truth 
ay my lord when it serves my turn
replied gramme
 it shall serve thy turn now said the
regent and falsehood shall be thy destruction
how much hast thou heard or
understood what we two have spoken
together 
the abbot 
but little my lord replied roland
graeme boldly which met my apprehension
saving that it seemed to me as if in
something you doubted the faith the
knight avenel under whose roof i was
nurtured
and what hast thou to say on that
point young man continued the regent
bending his eyes upon him with a keen and
strong expression observation
that said the page depends on the
quality those who speak against his honour
whose bread i have long eaten if
they be my inferiors i say they lie and
will maintain what i say with my barton 
if my equals still i say they lie and will do
battle in the quarrel if they list with my
sword if my superiors he paused
 proceed boldly said the regent
 what if thy superior said aught that nearly
touched your master's honour 
 i would say replied graeme that
he did ill to slander the absent and that my
vol lu e
 the abbot
master was a man who could render an account
 his actions to any one who should
manfully demand it him to his face
and it were manfully said replied the
regent what thinks thou my lord 
morton 
 i think replied morton that if the
young galliard resemble a certain ancient
friend ours as much in the craft his
disposition as he does in eye and in brow
there may be a wide difference betwixt
what he means and what he speaks
 and whom meanest thou that he resembles
so closely said murray
even the true and trusty julian 
replied morton
 but this youth belongs to the debateable
land said murray
 it may be so but julian was an outlying
striker venison and made many a
far cast when he had a fah doe in chase
 pshaw said the regent this is but
idle talk here thou hyndman thou curiosity
 conduct this youth to his compare
abbot 
non you will both he said to graeme
 keep yourselves in readiness to travel on
short notice and then motioning to him
courteously to withdraw he broke up the
interview
 the abbot
chapter 
it is and is not tis the thing i sought for
have kneel'd for pray'd for risk'd my fame and life for
and yet it is not no more than the shadow
upon the hard cold flat and polish'd mirror
is the warm graceful rounded living substance
which it presents in form and lineament
old plain
the usher with gravity which ill concealed
a jealous scowl conducted roland
graeme to a lower apartment where he
found his comrade the falconer the man
 office then briefly acquainted them that
this would be their residence till his grace's
further orders that they were to go to the
pantry to the buttery to the cellar and to
the kitchen at the usual hours to receive
the allowances becoming their station
instructions which adam woodcock's old
familiarity with the court made him perfectthe
abbot 
ly understand for your beds he said
you must go to the hostelry saint michael's
in respect the palace is now full 
the domestics the greater nobles
no sooner was the usher's back turned
than adam exclaimed with all the glee 
eager curiosity and now master roland
the news the news come unbutton
thy pouch and give us thy tidings what
says the regent asks he for adam woodcock
 and is all soldered up or must the
abbot unreason strap for it 
all is well in that quarter said the
page and for the rest but heyday
what have you taken the chain and medal
off from my bonnet 
 and meet time it was when yon usher
vinegarfaced rogue that he is began to
enquire what popish trangam you were
wearing by the mass the metal would
have been confiscated for consciencesake
like your other rattle trap yonder at 
which mrs lilies bears about on her
shoes in the guise a pair shoebuckles
 the abbot
this comes carrying popish nicknames
about you
 time jade exclaimed roland graeme
 has she melted down my rosary into
buckles for her clumsy hoofs which will
become such a garnish well nigh as well asa
cow's might but hang her let her keep
them many a dog's trick have i played
old lilies for want having something
better to do and the buckles will serve fora
remembrance do you remember the
verjuice i put into the comfits when old
wingate and she were to breakfast together
on easter morning 
in troth do i master roland the
majordomo's mouth was as crooked as a
hawk's beak for the whole morning afterward
and any other page in your room
would have tasted the discipline the
porter's lodge for it but my lady's favour
stood between your skin and many a jerking
 lord send you may be the better for
her protection in such matters
the abbot 
i am at least grateful for it adam 
and i am glad you put me in mind it
well but the news my young master
said woodcock spell me the tidings 
what are we to fly at next what did the
regent say to you f
nothing that i am to repeat again said
koland graeme shaking his head
why heyday said adam how prudent
we are become ail a sudden you
have advanced rarely in brief space master
roland you have well nigh had your
broken head and you have gained your
gold chain and you have made an enemy
master usher to wit with his two legs like
hawk's perches and you have had audience
 the first man in the realm and bear as
much mystery in your brow as if you had
flown in the courtsky ever since you were
hatched i believe in my soul you would
run with a piece the eggshell on your
head like the purlieus whom i would we
were after them again we used to call
whaup in the halidome and its neighbourhood
the abbot
hood but sit thee down boy adam
woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter
into forbidden secrets sit thee down
and i will go fetch the vivers i know the
butler and the panther old
the goodnatured falconer set forth upon
his errand busying himself about procuring
their refreshment and during his absence
roland graeme abandoned himself to the
strange complicated and yet heartstirring
reflections to which the events the morning
had given rise yesterday he was 
neither mark nor likelihood a vagrant boy
the attendant on a relative whose sane
judgment he himself had not the highest
opinion but now he had become he
knew not why or wherefore or to what
extent the custodier as the scottish phrase
went some important state secret in the
safe keeping which the regent himself
was concerned it did not diminish from
but rather added to the interest a situation
so unexpected that roland himself
did not perfectly understand wherein he
the abbor 
stood committed by the state secrets in
which he had unwittingly become participator
on the contrary he felt like one who
looks on a romantic landscape which
he sees the features for the first time and
then obscured with mist and driving tempest
the imperfect glimpse which the eye
catches rocks trees and other objects
around him adds double dignity to these
shrouded mountains and darkened abysses
 which the height depth and extent are
left to imagination
but mortals especially at the well appetite
age which precedes twenty years are
seldom so much engaged either by real or
conjectural subjects speculation but
what their earthly wants claim their hour
 attention and with many a smile did
our hero so the reader may term him if he
will hail the reappearance his friend
adam woodcock bearing on one wooden
platter a tremendous portion boiled beef
and on another a plentiful allowance 
 the abbot
greens or rather what the scotch call langkail
a groom followed with bread salt
and the other means setting forth a meal 
and when they had both placed on the oaken
table what they bore in their hands the falconer
observed that since he knew the court
it had got harder and harder every day to
the poor gentlemen and yeomen retainers
but that now it was an absolute flaying a
flea for the hide and tallow such thronging
to the wicket and such churlish answers
and such bare beefbones such a
shouldering at the butteryhatch and cellarage
and nought to be gained beyond small
insufficient single ale or at best with a single
strike malt to counterbalance a double
allowance water by the mass
though my young friend said he while he
saw the food disappearing fast under roland's
active exertions it is not so well to
lament for former times as to take the advantage
 the present else we are like to
lose on both sides
so saying adam woodcock drew his
the abbot 
chair towards the table unsheathed his
knife for every one carried that minister 
festive distribution for himself and imitated
his young companion's example who for the
moment had lost his anxiety for the future
in the eager satisfaction an appetite sharpened
by youth and abstinence
in truth they made though the materials
were sufficiently simple a very respectable
meal at the expence the royal allowance
and adam woodcock notwithstanding the
deliberate censure which he had passed on
the household beer the palace had taken
the fourth deep draught the black jack
ere he remembered him that he had spoken
in its dispraise flinging himself jollily and
luxuriously back in an old danse elbow
chair and looking with a careless glee
towards the page extending at the same
time his right leg and stretching the other
easily over it he reminded his companion
that he had not yet heard the ballad which
he had made for the abbot unreason's
 the abbot
revel and accordingly he struck merrily
up with
the pope that pagan full pride
has blinded us full lang
roland grasme who felt no great delight
as may be supposed in the falconer's
satire considering its subject began to
snatch up his mantle and fling it around his
shoulders an action which instantly interrupted
the ditty adam woodcock
 where the vengeance are you going
now he said thou restless boy thou
hast quicksilver in the veins thee to a
certainty and can'st no more abide any
douce and sensible communing than a
bootless hawk would keep perched on ray
wrist 
 why adam replied the page if
you must needs know i am about to take
a walk and look at this fair city one mayas
well be still mewed up in the old castle
 the lake if one is to sit the livelong night
between four stone walls and hearken to
old ballads
the abbot 
it is a new ballad the lord help thee
replied adam and that one the best
that ever was matched with a rousing chorus

 be it so said the page i will hear
it another day when the rain is dashing
against the windows and there is neither
steed stamping nor spur jingling nor feather
waving in the neighbourhood to mar
my marking it well but even now i want
to be in the world and to look about me
but the never a stride shall you go
without me said the falconer until the
regent shall take you whole and sound off
my hand and so if you will we may goto
the hostelry saint michael's and there
you will see company enough but through
the casement mark you me for as to rambling
through the street to seek seytons
and leslie and having a dozen holes drilled
in your new jacket with rapier and poniard
i will yield no way to it
to the hostelry saint michael's then
with all my heart said the page and they
 the abbot
left the palace accordingly rendered to the
sentinels at the gate who had now taken
their posts for the evening a strict account
 their names and business were dismissed
through a small wicket the closebarred
portal and soon reached the inn or
hostelry saint michael which stood in a
large courtyard off the main street close
under the descent the cantonhill the
place wide waste and uncomfortable resembled
rather an eastern caravansery
where men found shelter indeed but were
obliged to supply themselves with everything
else than one our modern inns 
where not one comfort shall to those be lost
who never ask or never feel the cost
but still to the inexperienced eye roland
greene the bustle and confusion 
this place public resort furnished excitement
and amusement in the large
room into which they had rather found
their own way than been ushered by mine
host travellers and natives the city enthe
abbot hi
tered and departed met and greeted gamed
or drank together regardless each other's
presence forming the strongest contrast to
the stern and monotonous order and silence
with which matters were conducted
in the wellordered household the knight
 avenel altercation every kind from
brawling to jesting was going on amongst
the groupes around them and yet the noise
and mingled voices seemed to disturb no
one and indeed to be noticed by no others
than by those who composed the groupe
to which the speaker belonged
the falconer passed through the apartment
to a projecting latticed window which
formed a sort recess from the room itself
and having here ensconced himself and his
companion he called for some refreshments 
and a tapster after he had shouted for the
twentieth time accommodated him with
the remains a cold capon and a neat's
tongue together with a pewter stoup 
weak french vindespair fetch a stoup
 brandywine thou knave we will be jolly
tonight master roland said he when
 the abbot
he saw himself thus accommodated and
let care come tomorrow
but roland had eaten too lately to enjoy
the good cheer j and feeling his curiosity
much sharper than his appetite he made
it his choice to look out the lattice which
overhung a large yard surrounded by the
stables the hostelry and fed his eyes on
the busy sight beneath while adam woodcock
after he had compared his companion
to the laird macfarlane's geese who
liked their play better than their meat
disposed his time with the aid cup and
trencher occasionally humming the burthen
 his birth strangled ballad and beating
time to it with his fingers on the little
round table in this exercise he was frequently
interrupted by the exclamations 
his companion as he saw something new in
the yard beneath to attract and interest
him
it was a busy scene for the number gentlemen
and nobles who were now crowded
into the city had filled all spare stables and
places public reception with their horses
the abbot 
and military attendants there were some
score yeomen dressing their own or their
masters horses in the yard whistling singing
laughing and upbraiding each other ina
style wit which the good order avenel
castle rendered strange to roland grasme's
ears others were busy repairing their own
arms or cleaning those their masters one
fellow having just bought a bundle twenty
spears was sitting in a corner employed
in painting the white handles the weapons
with yellow and vermillion other
lacqueys led large staghounds or wolfdogs
 noble race carefully muzzled to
prevent accidents to passengers all came
and went mixed together and separated
under the delighted eye the page whose
imagination had not even conceived a scene
so gaily diversified with the objects he had
most pleasure in beholding j so that he was
perpetually breaking the quiet reverie honest
woodcock and the mental progress
which he was making in his ditty by exclaiming
 look here adam look at the bonny
 the abbot
bay horse saint anthony what a gallant
forehand he hath got and see the goodly
grey which yonder fellow in the friezejacket
is dressing as awkwardly as if he had
never touched aught but a cow i would i
were nigh him to teach him his trade 
and lo you adam the gay milan armour
that the yeoman is scouring all steel and
silver like our knight's prime suit which
old wingate makes such account and see
to yonder pretty wench adam who comes
tripping through them all with her milkpail
 i warrant me she has had a long walk
from the loaning she has a stammel waistcoat
like your favourite cissy sunderland
master adam
by my hood lad answered the falconer
 it is well for thee thou wert brought
up where grace grev even in the castle
 avenel thou wert a wildblood enough
but hadst thou been nurtured here within
a flightshot the court thou hadst been
the veriest crackhemp a page that ever
wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy
the abbot 
side truly i wish it may well with
thee
 nay but leave thy senseless humming
and drumming old adam and come to the
window ere thou hast drenched thy senses
in the pintpot there see here comes a
merry minstrel with his crowd and a wench
with him that dances with bells at her ancles
 and see the yeomen and pages leave
their horses and the armour they were
cleaning and gather round as is very natural
to hear the music come old adam
we will thither too
 you shall call me cut if i do go down
said adam you are near as good minstrelsy
as he can make if you had the grace
to listen to it
 but the wench in the stammel waistcoat
is stopping too adam by heaven
they are going to dance frieze jacket
wants to dance with stammelwaistcoat but
she is coy and recusant
then suddenly changing his tone levity
into one deep interest and surprise
 the abbot
he exclaimed queen heaven what
is it that i see and then remained silent
the sage adam woodcock who was ina
sort languid degree amused with the
page's exclamations even while he professed
to despise them became at length rather
desirous to set his tongue once more going
that he might enjoy the superiority afforded
by his own intimate familiarity withall
the circumstances which excited in his
young companion's mind so much wonderment

well then he said at last what is it
you do see master roland that you have
become mute all a sudden 
roland returned no answer
i say master roland greene said the
falconer it is manners in my country fora
man to speak when he is spoken to
roland graeme remained silent
 the murrain is in the boy said adam
woodcock he has stared out his eyes and
talked his tongue to pieces i think
the falconer hastily drank off his can 
the abbot 
wine and came to roland who stood like
a statue with his eyes eagerly bent on the
courtyard though adam woodcock was
unable to detect amongst the merry scene
which it exhibited aught that could deserve
such devoted attention
the lad is mazed said the falconer
to himself
but roland greene had good reasons for
his surprise though they were not such ashe
could communicate to his companion
the touch the old man's instrument
for he had already begun to play had
drawn in several auditors from the street
when one entered the gate the yard
whose appearance exclusively arrested the
attention roland graeme he was 
his own age or a good deal younger and
from his dress and bearing might be the
same rank and calling having all the air 
coxcombry and pretension which accorded
with a handsome though slight and low figure
and an elegant dress in part hid by
a large purple cloak as he entered he
 the abbot
cast a glance up towards the windows and
to his extreme astonishment under the
purple velvet bonnet and white feather
roland recognized the features so deeply
impressed on his memory the bright and
clustered tresses the laughing full blue
eyes the well formed eyebrows the nose
with the slightest possible inclination to be
aquiline the ruby lip which an arch and
half suppressed smile seemed the habitual
expression in short the form and face 
catherine sey ton in man's attire however
and mimicking as it seemed not unsuccessfully
the bearing a youthful but forward
page
saint george and saint andrew said
the astonished roland graeme to himself
 was there ever such an audacious quean 
she seems a little ashamed her mummery
too for she holds the lap her cloak
to her fac and her colour is heightened 
but santa maria how she threads the
throng with as firm and bold a step as
if she had never tied petticoat round her
the abbot 
waist holy saints she holds up her ridingrod
as if she would lay it about some 
their ears that stand most in her way by
the hand my father she bears herself
like the very model pagehood hey 
what sure she will not strike friezejacket
in earnest but he was not long left in
doubt for the lout whom he had before repeatedly
noticed standing in the way the
bustling page and maintaining his place
with clownish obstinacy or stupidity the
advanced ridingrod was without a moment's
hesitation sharply applied to his
shoulders in a manner which made him
spring aside rubbing the part the body
which had received so unceremonious a
hint that it was in the way his betters
the party injured growled forth an oath or
two indignation and roland grasme
began to think flying down stairs to the
assistance the translated catherine j but
the laugh the yard was against friezejacket
which indeed had in these days
 the abbor
small chance fair play in a quarrel with velvet
and embroidery so that the fellow who
was a menial in the inn slunk back to finish
his task dressing the bonny grey laughed
at by all but most by the wench in the
stammel waistcoat his fellow servant who
to crown his disgrace had the cruelty to
cast an applauding smile upon the author
 the injury while with a freedom more
like the milkmaid the town than she 
the plains she accosted him with is
there any one you want here my pretty
gentleman that you seem in such haste 
i seek a sprig a lad said the seeming
gallant with a sprig holly in his
cap black hair and black eyes green jacket
and the air a country coxcomb i have
sought him through every close and alley
in the canongate the fiend gore him 
 why goda mercy nun muttered
roland greene much bewildered
i will enquire him presently out for your
fair young worship said the wench the
inn
the abbot 
do said the gallant squire and if
you bring me to him you shall have a groat
tonight and a kiss on sunday when you
have on a cleaner kirtle
why godmercy nun again muttered
roland this is a note above e la
in a moment after the servant entered
the room and ushered in the object his
surprise
while the disguised vestal looked with
unabashed brow and bold and rapid glance
 her eye through the various parties in
the large old room roland greeme who
felt an internal awkward sense bashful
confusion which he deemed altogether unworthy
 the bold and dashing character
to which he aspired determined not to be
browbeaten and put down by this singular
female but to meet her with a glance 
recognition so sly so penetrating so expressively
humorous as should shew her at
once he was in possession her secret and
master her fate and should compel her
vol f
 the abbot
to humble herself towards him at least into
the look and manner respectful and deprecating
observance
this was extremely well planned but
just as roland had called up the knowing
glance the suppressed smile the shrewd
intelligent look which was to ensure his
triumph he encountered the bold firm and
steady gaze his brother or sisterpage
who casting on him a falcon glance and
recognizing him at once as the object 
his search walked up with the most unconcerned
look the most free and undaunted
composure and hailed him with you sir
holly top i would speak with you
the steady coolness and assurance with
which these words were uttered although
the voice was the very voice he had heard
at the old convent and although the features
more nearly resembled those catherine
when seen close than when viewed
from a distance produced nevertheless
such a confusion in roland's mind that he
became uncertain whether he was not still
the abbot 
under a mistake from the beginning the
knowing shrewdness which should have
animated his visage faded into a sheepish
bashfulness and the halfsuppressed but
most intelligible smile became the senseless
giggle one who laughs to cover his
own disorder ideas
 do they understand a scotch tongue
in thy country holytop said this marvellous
specimen metamorphosis i
said i would speak with thee
 what is your business with my comrade
my young chick the game said
adam woodcock willing to step in to his
companion's assistance though totally at a
loss to account for the sudden disappearance
 all roland's usual smartness and
presence mind
 nothing to you my old cock the
perch replied the gallant go mind your
hawk's castings i guess by your bag and
your gauntlet that you are squire the
body to a sort kites
he laughed as he spoke and the laugh
 the abbot
reminded roland so irresistibly the
hearty fit risibility in which catherine
had indulged at his expence when they first
met in the old nunnery that he could scarce
help exclaiming catherine seyton by
heavens he checked the exclamation
however and only said i think sir we
two are not totally strangers to each other
 we must have met in our dreams then
said the youth and my days are too busy
to remember what i think at nights
 or apparently to remember upon one
day those whom you may have seen on the
preceding eve said roland graeme
the youth in his turn cast on him a look
 some surprise as he replied i know
no more what you mean than does the
horse i ride on if there be offence in your
words you shall find me as ready to take it
as any lad in lothian
you know well said roland though
if it pleases you to use the language a
stranger that with you i can have no purpose
to quarrel
the abbot 
let me do mine errand then and be
rid you said the page step hither
this way out that old leathern fist's hearing

they walked into the recess the window
which roland had left upon theyouth's
entrance into the apartment the messenger
then turned his back on the company
after casting a hasty and sharp glance around
to see if they were observed roland did
the same and the page in the purple mantle
thus addressed him taking at the same
time from under his cloak a short but beautifully
wrought sword with the hilt and ornaments
upon the sheath silver massively
chased and over gilded i bring you
this weapon from a friend who gives it you
under the solemn condition that you will
not unsheathed it until you are commanded
by your rightful sovereign for your
warmth temper is known and the presumption
with which you intrude yourself
into the quarrels others and therefore
this is laid upon you as a penance by those
 the abbot
who wish you well and whose hand will influence
your destiny for good or for evil
this is what i was charged to tell you soif
you will give a fair word for a fair sword
and pledge your promise with hand and
glove good and well and if not i will carry
back caliban to those who sent it
 and may i not ask who these areas
said roland gramme admiring at the same
time the beauty the weapon thus offered
him
 my commission in no way leads me
to answer such a question said he the
purple mantle
 but if i am offended said roland
 may i not draw to defend myself
 not this weapon answered the swordbearer
 but you have your own at command
and besides for what do you wear
your poniard 
 for no good said adam woodcock
who had now approached close to them 
 and that i can witness as well as any one
 stand back fellow said the messenger 
the abbot 
thou hast an intrusive curious face that
will come by a buffet if it is found where it
has no concern
 a buffet my young master malapert
said adam drawing back however best
keep down fist or by our lady buffet will
beget buffet 
be patient adam woodcock said
roland greene and let me pray you
fair sir since by such addition you chuse
for the present to be addressed may i not
barely unsheathed this fair weapon in pure
simplicity desire to know whether so
fair a hilt and scabbard are matched with a
befitting blade 
 by no manner means said the messenger
 at a word you must take it under
the promise that you never draw it until
you receive the commands your lawful
sovereign or you must leave it alone
 under that condition and coming from
your friendly hand i accept the sword
said roland taking it from his hand but
credit me that if we are to work together
in any weighty emprise as i am induced to
 the abbot
believe some confidence and openness on
your part will be necessary to give the right
impulse to my zeal i press for no more at
present it is enough that you understand
me
i understand you said the page exhibiting
the appearance unfeigned surprise
in his turn renounce me if do
here you stand suggesting and smuggling
and looking cunning as if there were some
mighty matter intrigue and common understanding
betwixt you and me whom
you never set your eyes on before 
 what said roland graeme will
you deny that we have met before 
marry that i will in any christian
court said the other page
and will you also deny said roland
 that it was recommended to us to study
each other's features well that in whatsoever
disguise the time might impose upon us
each should recognize in the other the secret
agent a mighty work do not you
remember that sister magdalen and dame
bridget
the abbot 
the messenger here interrupted him
shrugging up his shoulders with a look 
compassion bridget and magdalen why
this is madness and dreaming hark ye
master holly top your wits are gone on
woolgathering comfort yourself with a
caudle thatch your brainsick noddle with
a woollen night cap and so god be with
you
as he concluded this polite parting address
adam woodcock who was again
seated by the table on which stood the now
empty can said to him will you drink
a cup young man in the way courtesy
now you have done your errand and listen
a good song and without waiting for an
answer he commenced his ditty 
the pope that pagan full prideshath
blinded us full long
it is probable that the good wine had made
some innovation in the falconer's brain
otherwise he would have recollected the
danger introducing any thing like political
or polemical pleasantry into a public
f 
 the abbot
assemblage at a time when men's minds
were in a state great irritability todo
him justice he perceived his error and
stopped short so soon as he saw that the
word pope had at once interrupted the separate
conversations the various parties
which were assembled in the apartment 
and that many began to draw themselves
up bridle look big and prepare to take
part in the impending brawl while others
more decent and cautious persons hastily
paid down their laying and prepared ta
leave the place ere bad should come to
worse
and to worse it was soon likely to come 
for no sooner did woodcock's ditty reach
the ear the stranger page than uplifting
his ridingrod he exclaimed he who
speaks irreverently the holy father 
the church in my presence is the cub a
heretic wolfbitch and i will switch him as
i would a mongrel cur
and i will break thy young pate said
adam if thou dearest to lift a finger to
the abbot 
me and then in defiance the young
drawcansir's threats with a stout heart and
dauntless accent he again uplifted the stave
 the pope that pagan full pride
hath blinded
bat adam was able to proceed no farther
being himself unfortunately blinded
by a stroke the impatient youth's switch
across his eyes enraged at once by the
smart and the indignity the falconer started
up and darkling as he was for his eyes
watered too fast to permit his seeing anything
he would soon have been at close
grips with his insolent adversary had not
roland graeme contrary to his nature played
for once the prudent man and the peacemaker
and thrown himself betwixt them imploring
woodcock's patience you know
not he said with whom you have to do
and thou addressing the messenger who
stood scornfully laughing at adam's rage
 get thee gone whoever thou art j if thou
 the abbot
best what i guess thee thou well knowest
there are earnest reasons why thou shouldst
thou hast hit right for once hollytop
said the gallant though i guess you
drew your bow at a venture here host
let this yeoman have a pottle wine to
wash the smart out his eyes and there
is a french crown for him so saying he
threw the piece money on the table and
left the apartment with a quick yet steady
pace looking firmly at right and left as if
to defy interruption and snapping his fingers
at two or three respectable burghers
who declaring it was a shame that any one
should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence
 the pope were labouring to find
the hilts their swords which had got for
the present unhappily entangled in the
folds their cloaks but as the adversary
was gone ere any them had reached
his weapon they did not think it necessary
to unsheathe cold iron but merely observed
to each other this is more than masterful
violence to see a poor man stricken
the abbot 
in the face just for singing a ballad against
the whore babylon if the popes champions
are to be songsters in our very changehouses
we shall soon have the old shavelines
back again
the provost should look to it said
another and have some five or six armed
with partizans to come in upon the first
whistle to teach these gallants their lesson
forlookyouneighbourlugleatheritisnot
for decent householders like ourselves to be
brawling with the godless grooms and pert
pages the nobles that are bred up to little
else save bloodshed and blasphemy
for all that neighbour said lugleather
 i would have curried that youngster as
properly as ever i curried a lamb's hide had
not the hilt my bilbo been for the instant
beyond my grasp and before i could
turn my girdle gone was my master
ay said the others the devil go
with him and peace abide with us i give
my rede neighbours that we pay the laying
and be stepping homeward like brother
and brother j for old saint giles's is tolling
 the abbot
curfew and the street grows dangerous at
night
with that the good burghers adjusted their
cloaks and prepared for their departure
while he that seemed the briskest the three
laying his hand on his andrea ferrara observed
that they that spoke in praise the
pope on the highgate edinburgh had
best bring the sword saint peter to defend
them
while the illhumour excited by the insolence
 the young aristocrat was thus evaporating
in empty menace roland greene
had to controul the far more serious indignation
 adam woodcock why manit
was but a switch across the mazzard
blow your nose dry your eyes and you will
see all the better for it
by this light which i cannot see said
adam woodcock thou hast been false
friend to me young man neither taking
up my rightful quarrel nor letting me fight
it out myself
 fye for shame adam woodcock replied
the youth determined to turn the tathe
abbot 
bless on him and become in turn the counsellor
 good order and peaceable demeanour
 i say fye for shame alas that
you will speak thus here are you sent
with me to prevent my innocent youth
getting into snares 
 i wish your innocent youth were cut
short with a halter with all my heart said
adam who began to see which way the
admonition tended
 and instead setting before me
continued roland an example patience
and sobriety becoming the falconer sir
halbert glendinning you quaff me off i
know not how many flagons ale besides
a gallon wine and a full measure strong
waters
 it was but one poor pottle said poor
adam whom consciousness now reduced
to a merely defensive warfare
it was enough to pottle you handsomely
however said the page and then
instead going to bed to sleep off your
liquor must you sit singing your roistering
 the abbot
songs about popes and pagans till you have
got your eyes almost switched out your
head and but for my interference whom
your drunken ingratitude accuses deserting
you yon galliard would have cut your
throat for he was whipping out a linger
as broad as my hand and as sharp as a razor
 and these are lessons for an inexperienced
youth oh adam out upon you 
out upon you 
marry amen and with all my heart
said adam out upon my folly for expecting
any thing but impertinent raillery
from a page hke thee that if he saw his father
in a scrape would laugh at him instead
 lending him aid
 nay but i will lend you aid said the
page still laughing that is i will lend thee
aid to thy chamber good adam where thou
shalt sleep off wine and ale ire and indignation
and awake the next morning with as
much fair wit as nature has blessed thee
withal only one thing i will warn thee
good adam that henceforth and for ever
the abbot 
when thou fairest at me for being somewhat
hot at hand and rather too prompt to outwith
poniard or so thy admonition shall
serve as a prologue to the memorable adventure
 the switching saint michael's

with such condoling expressions he got
the crestfallen falconer to his bed and then
retired to his own pallet where it was sometime
ere he could fall asleep if the messenger
whom he had seen were really catherine
seyton what a masculine virago
and termagant must she be and stored
with what an inimitable command insolence
and assurance the brass on her
brow would furbish the front twenty
pages and i should know thought roland
what that amounts to and yet her features
her look her light gait her laughing
eye the art with which she disposed the
mantle to shew no more her limbs than
needs must be seen i am glad she had at
least that grace left the voice the smile
it must have been catherine seyton or
 the abbot
the devil in her likeness one thing is
good i have silenced the eternal predications
 that ass adam woodcock who has
set up for being a preacher and a governor
over me so soon as he has left the hawks
mew behind him
and with this comfortable reflection
joined to the happy indifference which
youth hath for the events the morrow
roland grme fell fast asleep
the abbot 
chapter v
now have you reft from me my staff my guide
who taught my youth as men teach untamed falcons
to use my strength discreetly i am reft
 comrade and counsel
old plain
in the grey the next morning's dawn
there was a loud knocking at the gate 
the hostelry andthose without proclaiming
that they came in the name the regent
were instantly admitted a moment or two
afterwards michael ingthewind stood
by the bedside our travellers
 up up i he said there is no slumber
where murray hath work ado
both sleepers sprung up and began to
dress themselves
you old friend said wing the wind to
adam woodcock must to horse instantly
with this packet to the monks kenna
quhair and with this delivering them a
he spoke to the knight aveneu
 the abbot
 as much as commanding the monks
to annul their election til warrant me 
an abbot quoth adam woodcock as he
put the packets into his bag and charging
my master to see it done to hawk atone
brother with another is less than fair
play methinks
 fash not thy beard about it old boy
said michael but betake thee to the saddle
presently for if these orders are not
obeyed there will be bare walls at the kirk
 saint mary's and it may be at the castle
 avenel to boot for i heard my lord 
morton loud with the regent and we are
at a pass that we cannot stand with him
anent trifles
 but said adam touching the abbot
 unreason what say they to that
outbreak an they be shrewishly disposed
i were better pitch the packets to satan
and take the other side the border
for my bield
 o that is passed over as a jest since
there was little harm done but hark thee
adams continued his comrade if there
the abbot 
was a dozen vacant abbacies in your road
whether jest or earnest reason or unreason
draw thou never one their mitres
over thy brows the time is not fitting
man besides our maiden longs to clip
the neck a fat churchman
 she shall never sheer mine in that capacity
said the falconer while he knotted
the kerchief in two or three double folds
around his sun burnt bullneck calling out
at the same time master roland master
roland make haste we must back to
perch and mew and thank heaven more
than our own wit with our bones whole
and without a stab in the stomach
nay but said wingthewind the
page goes not back with you the regent
has other employment for him
saints and sorrows exclaimed the
falconer master roland grme to remain
here and i to return to avenel 
why it cannot be the child cannot manage
himself in this wide world without me
and i question if he will stoop to any other
 the abbot
whistle than mine own there are times i
myself can hardly bring him to my lure
it was at roland's tongue's to say
something concerning the occasion they
had for using mutually each other's prudence
but the real anxiety which adam
evinced at parting with him took away his
disposition to such ungracious raillery the
falconer did not altogether escape however
for in turning his face towards the lattice
his friend michael caught a glimpse it
and exclaimed i pr'ythee adam woodcock
what hast thou been doing with these
eyes thine they are swelled to the
starting from the hoot 
 nought in the world said he after
casting a deprecating glance at roland
graeme but the effect sleeping in this
d d truckle without a pillow
i why adam woodcock thou art grown
strangely dainty said his old companion 
 i have known thee sleep all night with
no better pillow than a bush ling and
start up with the sun as gregg as a falcon 
and now thine eyes resembles
abbot 

tie was roused from his reverie by michael
wingthewind who reminded him
that it was necessary they should instantly
return to the palace as my lord regent
went to the sessions early in the morning
they went thither accordingly and 
a favourite old domestic who was
admitted nearer to the regent's person and
privacy than many whose posts were more
ostensible soon introduced graeme into a
small matted chamber where he had an
audience the present head the troubled
state scotland the earl murray was
clad in a sadcoloured morninggown with
a cap and slippers the same cloth but
even in this easy dishabille held his sheathed
rapier in his hand a precaution which
he adopted when receiving strangers rather
in compliance with the earnest remonstrances
 his friends and partizans than from
any personal apprehensions his own he
answered with a silent nod the respectful
obeisance the page and took one or two
turns through the small apartment in silence
fixing his keen eye on roland as if
 the abbot
he wished to penetrate into his very soul
at length he broke silence
 your name is i think julian graeme
roland graeme my lord not julian
replied the page
right i was misled by some trick 
my memory roland graeme from the
debateable land roland thou knowest
the duties which belong to a lady's service

i should know them my lord replied
roland having been bred so near the
person my lady avenel but i trust
never more to practise them as the knight
hath promised
be silent young man said the regent
 i am to speak and you to hear and
to obey it is necessary that for some space
at least you shall again enter into the service
 a lady who in rank hath no equal
in scotland and this service accomplished
i give thee my word as knight and prince
that it shall open to you a course ambition
such as may well gratify the aspiring
wishes one whom circumstances entitle
the abbot 
to entertain much higher views than thou
i will take thee into my household and near
to my person or at your own choice will
give you the command a footcompany 
either is a preferment which the proudest
laird in the land might be glad to assure to
a second son
 may i presume to ask my lord said
roland observing the earl paused for a reply
 to whom my poor services are in the
first place destined 
 you will be told hereafter said the
regent and then as if overcoming some
internal reluctance to speak further himself
he added or why should i not myself tell
you that you are about to enter into the
service a most illustrious most unhappy
lady into the service mary scotland

 the queen my lord said the page
unable to repress his surprise
 her who was the queen said
murray with a singular mixture displeasure
and embarrassment in his tone voice
 the abbot
 you must be aware young man that her
son reigns in her stead
he sighed from an emotion partly perhaps
natural and partly assumed
and am i to attend upon her grace in
her place imprisonment my lord again
demanded the page with a straightforward
and hardy simplicity which somewhat disconcerted
the sage and powerful statesman
she is not imprisoned answered murray
angrily j god forbid she should 
she is only sequestrated from state affairs
and from the business the public until
the world be so effectually settled that she
may enjoy her natural and uncontrouled
freedom without her royal disposition being
exposed to the practices wicked and
designing men it is for this purpose he
added that while she is to be furnished
as right is with such attendance as may befit
her present secluded state it becomes
necessary that those placed around her are
persons on whose prudence i can have reliance
you see therefore you are at once
the abbot 
called on to discharge an office most honourable
in itself and so to discharge it that you
may make a friend the regent scotland
thou art i have been told a singularly
apprehensive youth and i perceive by
thy look that thou doest already understand
what i would say on this matter
in this schedule your particular points 
duty are set down at length but the sum
required you is fidelity i mean fidelity
to myself and to the state you are therefore
to watch every attempt which is made
or inclination displayed to open any communication
with any the lords who have
become banders in the west with hamilton
with seyton with fleming or the like
it is true that my gracious sister reflecting
upon the ill chances that have lapped to the
state this poor kingdom from evil counsellors
who have abused her royal nature intime
past hath determined to sequestrate
herself from state affairs in future but it is
our duty as acting for and in name our
infant nephew to guard against the evils
which may arise from any mutation or 
the abbot
collation in her royal resolutions wherefore
it will be thy duty to watch and report
to our lady mother whose guest our sister
is for the present whatever may infer a disposition
to withdraw her person from the
place security in which she is lodged or
to open communication with those without
if however your observation should detect
any thing weight and which may
exceed mere suspicion fail not to send notice
by an especial messenger to me directly
and this ring shall be thy warrant to order
horse and man on such service and
now begone if there be half the wit in thy
head that there is apprehension in thy look
thou fully comprehended all that i would
say serve me faithfully and sure as i am
belted earl thy reward shall be great
roland grace made an obeisance and
was about to depart
the earl signed to him to remain i
have trusted thee deeply he said young
man for thou art the only one her suite
who has been sent to her by my own recommendation
her gentlewomen are her
the abbot 
own nomination it were too hard to have
barred her that privilege though some there
were who reckoned it inconsistent with sure
policy thou art young and handsome
mingle in their follies and see they cover
not deeper designs under the appearance 
female levity if they do mine do thou
countermine for the rest bear all decorum
and respect to the person thy mistress 
she is a princess though a most unhappy
one and hath been a queen though now
alas no longer such pay therefore to
her all honour and respect consistent with
thy fidelity to the king and me and
now farewell yet stay you travel with
lord lindesay a man the old world
rough and honest though untaught see
that thou offend him not for he is not patient
 raillery and thou i have heard art
a crackhalter this he said with a smile
then added i could have wished the lord
lindesay's mission had been entrusted to
some other and more gentle noble
 and wherefore should you wish that
g 
 the abbot
my lord said morton who even then entered
the apartment the council have
decided for the best we have had but too
many proofs this lady's stubbornness 
mind and the oak that resists the sharp
steel axe must be riven with the rugged
iron wedge and this is to be her page 
my lord regent hath doubtless instructed
you young man how you shall guide yourself
in these matters i will add but a little
hint on my part you are going to the castle
 a douglas where treachery never thrives
the first moment suspicion will be the
last your life my kinsman william
douglas understands no raillery and if he
once have cause to think you false you will
waver in the wind from the castle battlements
ere the sun set upon his anger and
is the lady to have an almoner withal 
occasionally douglas said the regent
 it were hard to deny the spiritual
consolation which she thinks essential to
her salvation
 you are ever too softhearted my lord
the abbot 
what a false priest to communicate her
lamentations not only to our friends in
scotland but to the guises to rome to
spain and i know not where 
fear not said the regent we will
take such order that no treachery shall happen

 look to it then said morton you
know my mind respecting the wench you
have consented she shall receive as a 
 one a family which all
others has ever been devoted to her and
inimical to us had we not been wary she
would have been purveyed a page as
much to her purpose as her waiting damsel
i hear a rumour that an old mad romish
pilgrims who passes for at least half a
saint among them was employed to find a
fit subject
 we have escaped that danger at least
said murray and converted it into a point
 advantage by sending this boy glendining's
 and for her waiting damsel you
cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead
 the abbot
 her four noble maries and all their silken
train
 i care not so much for the waiting
maiden said morton but i cannot brook
the cautioner i think priests all persuasions
are much like each other here is
john knox vho made such a noble pullerdown
is ambitious becoming a setter up
and a founder schools and colleges out 
the abbey lands and bishop's rents and
other spoils rome which the nobility 
scotland have won with their sword and
bow and with which he would nowendow
new hives to sing the old drone
 john is a man god said the regent
 and his scheme is a devout imagination

the sedate smile with which this was
spoken left it impossible to conjecture
whether the words were meant in approbation
or in derision the plan the scottish
reformer turning then to roland
graeme as if he thought he had been long
enough a witness this conversation he
the abbot 
bade him get him presently to horse since
my lord lindesay was already mounted
the page made his reverence and left the
apartment
guided by michael wingthewind he
found his horse ready saddled and prepared
for the journey in front the palace porch
where hovered about a score menatarms
whose leader shewed no small symptoms
 surly impatience
is this the jackanapes page for whom
wee have waited this long said he to 
 and my lord ruthven will
reach the castle long before us
michael assented and added that the boy
had been detained by the regent to receive
some parting instructions the leader
made an inarticulate sound in his throat
expressive sullen acquiesence and calling
to one his domestic attendants
 edward said he take the gallant into
your charge and let him speak with no one
else
he then addressed by the title sir
robert an elderly and respectable looking
 the abbot
gentleman the only one the party who
seemed above the rank a retainer or
domestic and observed that they must get
to horse with all speed
during this discourse and while they
were riding slowly along the street the
suburb roland had time to examine more
accurately the looks and figure the baron
who was at their head
lord lindesay the byres was rather
touched than stricken with years his upright
stature and strong limbs still shewed
him fully equal to all the exertions and fatigues
 war his thick eyebrows now
partially grizzled lowered over large eyes
full dark fire which seemed yet darker
from the uncommon depth at which they
were set in his head his features naturally
strong and harsh had their sternness exaggerated
by one or two scars received in battle
these features naturally calculated to
express the harsher passions were shaded by
an open steel cap with a projecting front
but having no visor over the gorget which
fell the black and grizzled beard the grim
the abbot 
old baron and totally hid the lower part
 his face the rest his dress was a loose
buffcoat which had once been lined with
silk and adorned with embroidery but which
seemed much stained with travel and damaged
with cuts received probably in battle
it covered a corslet which had once been
 polished steel fairly gilded but was now
somewhat injured with rust a sword 
antique make and uncommon size framed
to be wielded with both hands a kind 
weapon which was then beginning to go
out use hung from his neck in a baldrick
and was so disposed as to traverse his
whole person the huge hilt appearing over
his left shoulder and the point reaching
well nigh to the right heel and jarring
against his spur as he walked this unwieldy
weapon could only be unsheathed
by pulling the handle over the left should
no human arm was long enough
to draw it in the usual manner the whole
equipment was that a rude warrior negligent
 his exterior even to misanthropic
the abbot
cal sullenness and the short harsh haughty
tone which he used towards his attendants
belonged to the same unpolished character

the personage who rode with lord lindsay
at the head the party was an absolute
contrast to him in manner form
and features his thin and silky hair was
already white though he seemed not above
fortyfive or fifty years old his tone 
voice was soft and insinuating his form
thin spare and bent by a habitual stoop 
his pale cheek was expressive shrewdness
and intelligence his eye was quick
though placid and his whole demeanour
mild and conciliatory he rode an ambling
nag such as were used by ladies clergymen
or others peaceful professions wore
a riding habit black velvet with a cap
and feather the same hue fastened up
by a golden medal and for show and as a
mark rank rather than for use carried a
walking sword as the short light rapiers
were called without any other arms offensive
or defensive
the abbot ll
the party had now quitted the town
and proceeded at a steady trot towards
the westward as they prosecuted their
journey roland graeme would gladly have
learned something its purpose and tendency
but the countenance the personage
next to whom he had been placed in the
train discouraged all approach to familiarity
the baron himself did not look more
grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer
whose grizzly beard fell over his
mouth like the portcullis before the gate 
a castle as if for the purpose preventing
the escape any word which absolute
necessity did not demand the utterance
the rest the train seemed under the
same taciturn influence and journeyed on
without a word being exchanged amongst
them more like a troop carthusian friars
than a party military retainers roland
graeme was surprised at this extremity
 discipline for even in the household
 the knight avenel though somewhat
distinguished for the accuracy with which
 the abbot
decorum was enforced a journey was a pes 
riot licence during which jest and song
and every thing within the iitnits becoming
mirth and pastime was freely permitted
this unusual silence was however sofar
acceptable that it gave him time to
bring any shadow judgment which he
possessed to council on his own situation
and prospects which would have appeared
to any reasonable person in the highest degree
dangerous and perplexing
it was quite evident that he had through
various circumstances not under his own 
controul formed contradictory connexions
with both the contending factions by whose
strife the kingdom was distracted without
being properly an adherent either it
seemed also clear that the same situation in
the household the deposed queen to
which he was now promoted by the influence
 the regent had been destined to
him by his enthusiastic grandmother magdalen
grme for on this subject the words
which morton had dropped had been a ray
the abbot l
 light yet it was no less clear that these
two persons the one the declared enemy
the other the enthusiastic votary the catholic
religion the one at the head the
king's new government the other who regarded
that government as a criminal usurpation
must have required and expected very
different services from the individual whom
they had thus united in recommending it
required very little reflection to foresee that
these contradictory claims on his services
might speedily place him in a situation
where his honour as well as his life might
be endangered but it was not in roland
grasme's nature to anticipate evil before it
came or to prepare to combat difficulties
before they arrived i will see this beautiful
and unfortunate mary stuart said he
 whom we have heard so much and
then there will be time enough to determine
whether i will be kinsman or queensman
none them can say i have given
word or promise to either their factions 
for they have led me up and down like a
 the abbor
blind billy without giving me any light into
what i was to do but it was lucky that
grim douglas came into the regent's closet
this morning otherwise i had never got
free him without plighting my troth todo
all the earl would have me which seemed
after all but foul play to the poor imprisoned
lady to place her page as an espial
on her
skipping thus lightly over a matter 
such consequence the thoughts the hairbrained
boy went a woolgathering after
more agreeable topics now he admired
the gothic towers barnbougle rising
from the seabeaten rock and overlooking
one the most glorious landscapes in scotland
 and now he began to consider what
notable sport for the hounds and the hawks
must be afforded by the variegated ground
over which they travelled and now he
compared the steady and dull trot at which
they were then prosecuting their journey
with the delight sweeping over hill and
dale in pursuit his favourite sports as
the abbot 
under influence these joyous recollections
he gave his horse the spur and made
him execute a gambade he instantly incurred
the censure his grave neighbour who
hinted to him to keep the pace and move
quietly and in order unless he wished such
notice to be taken his eccentric movements
as was likely to be very displeasing
to him
the rebuke and the restraint under which
the youth now found himself brought back
to his recollection his late goodhumoured
and accommodating associate and guide
adam woodcock and from that topic his
imagination made a short flight to avenel
castle to the quiet and unconfined life its
inhabitants the goodness his early protectress
not forgetting the denizens its
stables kennels and hawk mews in a brief
space all these subjects meditation gave
way to the remembrance that riddle 
womankind catherine sey ton who appeared
before the eye his mind now in her
female form now in her male attire now
 the abbot
in both at once like some strange dream
which presents to us the same individual
under two different characters at the same
instant her mysterious present also recurred
to his recollection the sword which
he now wore at his side and which he was
not to draw save by command his legitimate
sovereign but the key this mystery
he judged he was likely to find in the
issue his present journey
with such thoughts passing through his
mind roland graeme accompanied the
party lord lindesay to the queen'sferry
which they passed in vessels that
lay in readiness for them they encountered
no adventure whatsoever in their passages
excepting one horse being lamed in
getting into the boat an incident very common
on such occasions until a few years
ago when the ferry was completely regulated
what was more peculiarly characteristic
 the olden age was the discharge 
a culverin at the party from the battlements
 the old castle rosette on the
the abbot l
tiorth side the ferry the lord which
happened to have some public or private
quarrel with the lord lindesay and took
this mode expressing his resentment
the insult however as it was harmless remained
unnoticed and unavenged nor did
anything else occur worth notice until the
band had come where lochleven spread its
magnificent sheet waters to the beams 
a bright summer sun
the ancient castle which occupies an
island nearly in the centre the lake recalled
to the page that avenel in which
he had been nurtured but the lake was
much larger and adorned with several islets
besides that on which the fortress was situated
 and instead being embosomed in
hills like that avenel had upon the
southern side only a splendid mountainous
screen being the descent one the lomond
hills and on the other was surrounded
by the extensive and fertile plain 
kinross roland grasme looked with some
degree dismay on the watergirdled forts
the abbot
tress which then as now consisted only 
one large donjonkeep surrounded with a
courtyard with two round flankingtowers
at the angles which contained wutliin its
circuit some other buildings inferior
importance a few old trees clustered together
near the castle gave some relief to
the air desolate seclusion but yet the
page while he gazed upon a building so
sequestered could not but feel for the situation
 a captive princess doomed to
dwell there as well as for his own i must
have been born he thought under the star
that presides over ladies and lakes water
for i cannot by any means escape from the
service the one or from dwelling in the
other but if they allow me not the fair
freedom my sport and exercise they shall
find it as hard to confine a wilddrake as a
youth who can swim like one
the band had now reached the edge 
the water and one the party advancing
displayed lord lindesay's pennon waving
it repeatedly to and fro while that baron
the abbot 
himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle
a banner was presently displayed from the
roof the castle in reply to these signals
and one or two figures were seen busied as
if unmooring a boat which lay close to the
islet
it will be some time ere they can reach
us with the boat said the companion 
the lord lindsay should we not do well
to proceed to the town and array ourselves
in some better order ere we appear befores

 you may do as you list sir robert
replied lindesay have neither time nor
temper to waste on such vanities she has
cost me many a hard ride and must not
now take offence at the thread bare cloak
and soiled doublet that i am arrayed in it
is the livery to which she has brought all
scotland
 do not speak so harshly said sir robert
 if she hath done wrong she hath
dearly abed it and in losing all real power
vol n h
 the abbot
one would not deprive her the little external
homage due at once to a lady and a
princess
 i say to you once more sir robert
melville replied lindesay do as you
will for me i am now too old to drink
myself as a gallant to grace the bower 
dames
 the bower dames my lord said
melville looking at the rude old tower
 is it yon dark and grated castle the
prison a captive queen to which you
give so gay a name 
name it as you list replied lindesay 
had the regent desired to send an envoy
capable to speak to a captive queen there
are many gallants in his court who would
have courted the occasion to make speeches
out amadis gaul or the mirror 
knighthood but when he sent blunt old
lindesay he knew he would speak to a misguided
woman as her former misdoings and
her present state render necessary i sought
not this employment it has been thrust
the abbot 
upon me and i will not cumber myself with
more form in the discharge it than needs
must be tacked to such an occupation
so saying lord lindesay threw himself
from horseback and wrapping his ridingcloak
around him lay down at lazy length
upon the sward to await the arrival the
boat which was now seen rowing from the
castle toward the shore sir robert melville
who had also dismounted walked at short
turns to and fro upon the bank his arms
crossed on his breast often looking to the
castle and displaying in his countenance a
mixture sorrow and anxiety the rest
 the party sate like statues on horseback
without moving so much as the points 
their lances which they held upright in the
air
as soon as the boat approached a rude
quay or landingplace near to which they
had stationed themselves lord lindesay
started up from his recumbent posture and
asked the person who steered why he had
 the abbot
not brought a larger boat with him to transport
his retinue
 so please you replied the boatman
because it is the order our lady that
we bring not to the castle more than four
persons
 thy lady is a wise woman said lindsay
 to suspect me treachery or had
i intended it what is to hinder us from
throwing you and your comrades into the
lake and filling the boat with my own fellows

the steersman on hearing this made a
hasty signal to his men to back their oars
and hold oft from the shore which they
were approaching
why thou ass said lindesay thou
didst not think that i meant thy fool's head
serious harm hark thee friend with
fewer than three servants i will go nowhither
sir robert melville will require
at least the attendance one domestic 
and it will be at your peril and your lady's
the abbot 
to refuse us admission come hither as weare
on matters great national concern
the steersman answered with firmness
but with great civ ility expression that his
orders were positive to bring no more than
four into the island but he offered to row
back to obtain a revisal his orders
 do so my friend said sir robert melville
after he had in vain endeavoured to
persuade his stubborn companion to consent
to a temporary abatement his train
row back to the castle sith it will be no
better and obtain thy lady's orders to transport
the lord lindesay myself and our
retinue hither
and hearken said lord lindesay
take with you this page who comes as an
attendant on your lady's guest dismount
sirrah said he addressing roland and
embark with them in that boat
 and what is to become my horse 
said graeme i am answerable for him to
my master
 will relieve you the charge said
 the abbot
lindesay thou wilt have little enow todo
with horses for ten years to come
 if i thought so said roland but he
was interrupted by sir robert melville
who said to him goodhumouredly dispute
it not young friend resistance can
do no good but may well run thee into
danger
roland greene felt the justice what
he said and though neither delighted with
the matter nor manner lindesay's address
deemed it best to submit to necessity
and to embark without further remonstrance
the men plied their oars the
quay with the party horse stationed near
it receded from the page's eyes the castle
and the islet seemed to draw near in the
same proportion and in a brief space he
landed under the shadow a huge old tree
which overhung the landingplace the
steersman and graeme leaped ashore the
boatmen remained lying on their oars ready
for further service

chapter 
could valour aught avail or people's love
france had not wept navarre's brave henry slain 
if wit or beauty could compassion move
the rose scotland had not wept in vain
elegy in a royal mausoleum lewis
at the gate the courtyard lochleven
appeared the stately form the
lady lochleven a female whose early
charms had captivated james v by whom
she became mother the celebrated regent
murray as she was noble birth
being a daughter the house mar
and great beauty her intercourse with
james did not prevent her being afterwards
sought in honourable marriage by many
gallants the time among whom she had
 the abbot
preferred sir william douglas cochlea
but well has it been said
sour pleasant vices
are made the whips to scourge us 
the station which the lady cochlea
even now held as the wife a man high
rank and interest and the mother a lawful
family did not prevent her nourishing a
painful sense degradation even while she
was proud the talents the power and the
station her son now prime ruler the
state but still a pledge her illicit intercourse
had james done to her she said
in her secret heart the justice he owed her
she had seen in her son as a source unmixed
delight and unchastened pride the
lawful monarch scotland and one the
ablest who ever swayed the sceptre the
house mar not inferior in antiquity or
grandeur to that drummond would then
have also boasted a queen amongst its
daughters and escaped the stain attached
to female frailty even when it has a royal
lover for its apology while such feelings
the abbot 
preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe
they had a corresponding effect on her
countenance where with the remains 
great beauty were mingled traits indicative
 inward discontent and peevish melancholy
it perhaps contributed to increase
this habitual temperament that the lady
loehleven had adopted uncommonly rigid
and severe views religion imitating in
her ideas reformed faith the very worst
errors the catholics in limiting the benefit
 the gospel to those who profess their
own speculative tenets
in every respect the unfortunate queen
mary's now the compulsory guest or rather
prisoner this sullen lady was obnoxious
to her hostess lady loehleven disliked
her as the daughter mary guise the
legal possessor those rights over james's
heart and hand which she conceived herself
to have been injuriously deprived and
yet more so as the professor a religion
which she detested worse than paganism
such was the dame who with stately
 the abbot
mien and sharp yet handsome features
shrouded by her black velvet coif interrogated
the domestic who steered her barge
to the shore what had become lindesay
and sir robert melville the man related
what had passed and she smiled scornfully
as she replied fools must be flattered
not fought with row back make thy
excuse as thou canst say lord ruthven
hath already reached this castle and that he
is impatient for lord lindesay's presence
away with thee randal yet stay what
galopin is that thou hast brought hither 
 so please you my lady he is the page
who is to wait upon 
 ay the new male minion said the
lady lochleven j the female attendant
arrived yesterday i shall have a wellordered
house with this lady and her retinue 
but i trust they will soon find some others
to undertake such a charge begone randal
 and you to roland graeme follow
me to the garden
she led the way with a slow and stately
the abbot 
step to the small garden which enclosed
by a stone wall ornamented with statues
and an artificial fountain in the centre
extended its dull parterres on the side 
the courtyard with which it communicated
by a low and arched portal within the narrow
circuit its formal and limited walks
mary stuart was now learning to perform
the weary part a prisoner which with
little interval she was doomed to sustain
during the remainder her life she was
followed in her slow and melancholy exercise
by two female attendants but in the
first glance which roland greene bestowed
upon one so illustrious by birth so distinguished
by her beauty accomplishments
and misfortunes he was sensible the
presence no other than the unhappy
queen scotland
her face her form have been so deeply
impressed upon the imagination that even at
the distance nearly three centuries it is unnecessary
to remind the most ignorant and
uninformed reader the striking traits which
 the abbot
characterize that remarkable countenance
which seems at once to combine our ideas 
the majestic the pleasing and the brilliant
leaving us to doubt whether they express
most happily the queen the beauty or the
accomplished woman who is there at the
very mention mary stuart's name that
has not her countenance before him familiar
as that the mistress his youth or
the favourite daughter his advanced age 
even those who feel themselves compelled
to believe all or much what her enemies
laid to her charge cannot think without
a sigh upon a countenance expressive
 anything rather than the foul crimes
with which she was charged when living
and which still continue to shade if not
to blacken her memory that brow so
truly open and regal those eyebrows so
regularly graceful which yet were saved
from the charge regular insipidity by
the beautiful effect the hazel eyes which
they overarched and which seem to utter
a thousand histories the nose with
the abbot 
all its grecian precision outline the
mouth so well proportioned so sweetly
formed as if designed to speak nothing but
what was delightful to hear the dimpled
chin the stately swanhke neckform a countenance
the like which we know not to
have existed in any other character moving
in that high class life where the actresses
as well as the actors command general
and undivided attention it is in vain
to say that the portraits which exist this
remarkable woman are not like each other 
for amidst their discrepancy each possesses
general features which the eye at once acknowledges
as peculiar to the vision which
our imagination has raised while we read
her history for the first time and which
has been impressed upon it by the numerous
prints and pictures which we have
seen indeed we cannot look on the worst
 them however deficient in point execution
without saying that it is meant for
queen mary and no small instance it is
 the power beauty that her charms
 the abbot
should have remained the subject not merely
 admiration but warm and chivalrous
interest after the lapse such a length
 time we know that by far the most
acute those who in latter days have
adopted the unfavourable view mary's
character longed like the executioner before
his dreadful task was performed to kiss
the fair hand her on whom he was about
to perform so horrible a duty
dressed then in a deep mourning robe
and with all those charms face shape and
manner with which faithful tradition has
made each reader familiar mary stuart advanced
to meet the lady lochleven who
on her part endeavoured to conceal dislike
and apprehension under the appearance 
respectful indifference the truth was that
she had experienced repeatedly the queen's
superiority in that species disguised yet
cutting sarcasm with which women can successfully
avenge themselves for real and
substantial injuries it may be well doubted
whether this talent was not as fatal to
the abbot 
its possessor as the many others enjoyed by
that highly gifted but most unhappy female
for while it often afforded her a momentary
triumph over her keepers it failed not to
exasperate their resentment and the satire
and sarcasm in which she had indulged
where frequently retaliated by the deep and
bitter hardships which they had the power
 inflicting it is well known that her
death was at length hastened by a letter
which she wrote to queen elizabeth in
which she treated her jealous rival and the
countess shrewsbury with the keenest
irony and ridicule
as the ladies met together the queen
said bending her head at the same time in
return to the obeisance the lady lochleven
 we are this day fortunate we
enjoy the company our amiable hostess
at an unusual hour and during a period
which we have hitherto been permitted to
give to our private exercise but our good
hostess knows well she has at all times access
to our presence and need not observe
 the abbot
the useless ceremony requiring our permission

i am sorry my presence is deemed an
intrusion by your grace said the lady
 lochleven i came but to announce
the arrival an addition to your train
motioning with her hand towards roland
graeme a circumstance towards which
ladies are seldom indifferent
 o i crave your ladyship's pardon 
and am bent to the earth with obligation for
the kindness my nobles or my sovereigns
shall i call them who have permitted me
such a respectable addition to my personal
retinue
they have indeed studied madam
said the lady lochleven to shew their
kindness toward your grace something at
the risk perhaps sound policy and i trust
their doings will not be misconstrued
impossible said the queen the
bounty which permits the daughter so
many kings and who yet is queen the
the abbot 
realm the attendance two waiting women
and a boy is a grace which mary stuart can
never sufficiently acknowledge why my
train will be equal to that any countrydame
in this your kingdom fife saving
but the lack a gentlemanusher and two
blue coated servingmen but i must not
forget in my selfish joy the additional trouble
and charges to which this augmentation
 our train will put our kind hostess and
the whole house lochleven it is this
i am aware which clouds your brows my
worthy lady but be good cheer the
crown scotland has many a fair manor
and your affectionate son and my no less
affectionate brother will endow the good
knight your husband with the best them
ere mary should be dismissed from this hospitable
castle from your ladyship's lack 
means to support the charges
the douglass lochleven madam
answered the lady have known for ages
how to discharge their duty to the state
 the abbot
without looking for reward even when the
task was both irksome and dangerous
nay but my dear lochleven said the
queen you are over scrupulous i pray
you accept a goodly manor what should
support the queen scotland in this her
princely court saving her own crown lands
and who should minister to the wants 
a mother save an affectionate son like the
earl murray who possesses so wonderfully
both the power and inclination or
said you it was the danger the task which
clouded your smooth and hospitable brow 
no doubt a page is a formidable addition
to my bodyguard females and i bethink
me it must have been for that reason
that my lord lindesay refused even now
to venture within the reach a force so
formidable without being attended by a
competent retinue
the lady lochleven started and looked
something surprised and mary suddenly
changing her manner from the smooth ironthe
abbot 
ital affectation mildness to an accent 
austere command and drawing up at the
same time her fine person said with the full
majesty her rank yes lady lochleven
 i know that ruthven is already in
the castle and that lindesay waits on the
bank the return your barge to bring him
hither along with sir robert melville for
what purpose do these nobles come and
why am i not in ordinary decency apprized
 their arrival 
 their purpose madam replied the
lady lochleven they must themselves
explain but a formal annunciation were
needless where your grace hath attendants
who can play the espial so well
 alas poor fleming said the queen
turning to the elder the female attendants
 thou wilt be tried condemned and
gib betted for a spy in the garrison because
thou didst chance to cross the great
hall while my good lady lochleven was
parleying at the full pitch her voice with
her pilot randal put black wool in thy
 the abbot
ears girl as you value the wearing them
longer remember in the castle lochleven
ears and tongues are matters not 
use but show merely our good hostess
can hear as well as speak for us all
we excuse your further attendance my
lady hostess she said once more addressing
the object her resentment and
retire to prepare for an interview with our
rebel lords we will use the antichamber
 our sleeping apartment as our hall
 audience you young man she proceeded
addressing roland graeme aid at
once softening the ironical sharpness her
manner into goodhumoured raillery you
who are all our male attendance from our
lord high chamberlain down to our least
galopin follow us to prepare our court
she turned and walked slowly towards
the castle the lady lochleven folded
her arms and smiled in bitter resentment
as she watched her retiring steps
 thy whole male attendance she muttered
repeating the queen's last words
the abbot 
 and well for thee had it been had thy
train never been larger then turning to
roland in whose way she had stood while
making this pause she made room for him
to pass saying at the same time art thou
already evesdropping follow thy mistress
minion and if thou wilt tell her what i have
now said
roland graeme hastened after his royal
mistress and her attendants who had just
entered a posterngate communicating betwixt
the castle and the small garden they
ascended a winding stair as high as the second
storey which was in a great measure
occupied by a suite three rooms opening
into each other and assigned as the dwelling
 the captive princess the outermost
was a small hall or outerroom within
which opened a large parlour and from
that again the queen's bedroom another
small apartment which opened into
the same parlour contained the beds the
gentlewomen in waiting
 the abbot
roland graeme stepped as became his
station into the outermost these apartments
there to await such orders as might
be communicated to him from the grated
window the room he saw lindesay
melville and their followers disembark 
and observed that they were met at the castle
gate by a third noble to whom lindesay
exclaimed in his loud harsh voice my
lord ruthven you have the start us
at this instant the page's attention was
called to a burst hysterical sobs from the
inner apartment and to the hurried ejaculations
 the terrified females which led him
almost instantly to hasten to their assistance
when he entered he saw that the queen
had thrown herself into the large chair
which stood nearest the door and was sobbing
for breath in a strong fit hysterical
affection the elder female supported her
in her arms while the younger bathed her
face with water and with tears alternately
hasten young man said the elder
the abbot 
lady in alarm fly call in assistance she
is swooning 
but the queen ejaculated in a faint and
broken voice stir not i charge you 
call no one to witness i am better i will
recover instantly and indeed with an
effort which seemed like that one struggling
for life she sate up in her chair and
endeavoured to resume her composure
while her features yet trembled with the
violent emotion body and mind which
she had undergone i am ashamed 
my weakness girls she said taking the
hands her attendants j but it is over
and i am mary stuart once more the savage
tone that man's voice my knowledge
 his insolence the name which he
named the purpose for which they come
may excuse a moments weakness and it
shall be a moment's only she snatched
from her head the curch or cap which had
been disordered during her hysterical agoi
ny shook down the thick clustered tresses
 dark brown which had been before 
the abbot
ed under it and drawing her slender fingers
across the labyrinth which they formed
she arose from the chair and stood
like the inspired image a grecian prophetess
in a mood which partook at once
 sorrow and pride smiles and tears
 we are ill appointed she said to meet
our rebel subjects but as far as we may
we will strive to present ourselves as becomes
their queen follow me my maidens
she said what says thy favourite
song my fleming 
my maids come to my dressing bower
and deck my nutbrown hair 
where'er ye laid a plait before
look ye lay ten times mair
alas she added when she had repeated
with a smile these lines an old ballad
 violence has already robbed me the
ordinary decorations my rank and the
few that nature gave me have been destroyed
by sorrow and by fear yet while she
spoke thus she again let her slender fingers
stray through the wilderness the beauties
abbot 
ful tresses which veiled her kingly neck and
swelling bosom as if in her agony mind
she had not altogether lost the consciousness
 her unrivalled charms roland graeme
on whose youth inexperience and ardent
sense what was dignified and lovely the
demeanour so fair and highborn a lady
wrought like the charm a magician stood
rooted to the spot with surprise and interest
longing to hazard his life in a quarrel
so fair as that which mary stuart's must
needs be she had been bred in france 
she was possessed the most distinguished
beauty she had reigned a queen and
a scottish queen to whom knowledge 
character was as essential as the use vital
air in all these capacities mary was
 all women on the earth most alert at
perceiving and using the advantages which
her charms gave her over almost all who
came within the sphere their influence
she cast on roland a glance which might
nave melted a heart stone my poor
boy she said with a feeling partly real
vol n i
 the abbot
partly political thou art a stranger to us
sent to this doleful captivity from the society
 some tender mother or sister or
maiden with whom you had freedom to
tread a gay measure round the may pole i
grieve for you but you are the only male
in my limited household wilt thou obey
my orders 
to the death madam said graeme ina
determined tone
 then keep the door mine apartment
said the queen keep it till they
offer actual violence or till we shall be fitly
arrayed to receive these intrusive visitors

 i will defend it till they pass over my
body said roland graeme any hesitation
which he had felt concerning the line 
conduct he ought to pursue being completely
swept away by the impulse the
moment
 not so my good youth answered mary
 not so command thee if i have
one faithful subject beside me much need
the abbot 
god wot i have to care for his safety
resist them but till they are put to the
shame using actual violence and then
give way i charge you remember my commands
and with a smile expressive at
once favour and authority she turned
from him and followed by her attendants
entered the bedroom
the youngest paused for half a second ere
she followed her companion and made a signal
to roland graeme with her hand he had
been already long aware that this was catherine
seyton a circumstance which could
not much surprise a youth quick intellects
who recollected the sort mysterious discourse
which had passed betwixt the two matrons
at the deserted nunnery and on which
his meeting with catherine in this place
seemed to cast so much light yet such was
the engrossing effect mary s presence that
it surmounted for the moment even the feelings
 a youthful lover and it was not until
catherine seyton had disappeared that
roland began to consider in what relation
 the abbor
they were to stand to each other she held
up her hand to me in a commanding manner
he thought j perhaps she wanted to
confirm my purpose for the execution 
the queen's commands for i think she
could scarce purpose to scare me with the
sort discipline which she administered to
freezejacket and to poor adam woodcock
but we will see to that anon j meantime
let us do justice to the trust reposed
in us by this unhappy queen i think my
lord murray will himself own that it is
the duty a faithful page to defend his lady
against intrusion on her privacy
accordingly he stepped to the little vestibule
made fast with lock and bar the
door which opened from thence to the large
staircase and then sate himself down to attend
the result he had not long to wait
a rude and strong hand first essayed to
lift the latch then pushed and shook the
door with violence and when it resisted his
attempt to open it exclaimed undo the
door there you within 
the abbot 
 why and at whose command said
the page am i to undo the door the
queen scotland 
another vain attempt which made hinge
and bolts jingle shewed that the impatient
applicant without would willingly have entered
without regarding his challenge j but
at length an answer was returned
 undo the door on your peril the lord
lindesay comes to speak with the lady
mary scotland
the lord lindesay as a scottish noble
answered the page must await his
sovereign's leisure
an earnest altercation ensued amongst
those without in which roland distinguished
the remarkably harsh voice lindesay
in reply to sir robert melville who appeared
to have been using some soothing language
 no no no i tell thee no i
will place a petard against the door rather
than be baulked by a profligate woman and
bearded by an insolent footboy
yet at least said melville let me
 the abbot
try fair means in the first instance violence
to a lady would stain your scutcheon
for ever or await till my lord ruthven
comes
 will await no longer said lindesay 
it is high time the business were done
and we on our return to the council but
thou mayest try thy fair play as thou callest
it while i cause my train to prepare
the petard i came hither provided with as
good gunpowder as blew up the kirk 
field
for god's sake be patient said melville
 and approaching the door he said
as speaking to those within let the queen
know that i her faithful servant robert
melville do entreat her for her own sake
and to prevent worse consequence that she
will undo the door and admit lord lindsay
who brings a mission from the council
 state
 i will do your errand to the queen
said the page and report to you her answer

the abbot 
he went to the door the bedchamber
and tapping against it gently it was
opened by the elder lady to whom he communicated
his errand and returned with
directions from the queen to admit sir robert
melville and lord lindesay roland
greene returned to the vestibule and opened
the door accordingly into which the
lord lindesay strode with the air a soldier
who has fought his way into a conquered
fortress j while melville deeply dejected
followed him more slowly
i draw you to witness and to record
said the page to this last that save for
the especial commands the queen i
would have made good the entrance with
my best strength and my best blood against
all scotland
 be silent young man said melville
in a tone grave rebuke add not brands
to dre this is no time to make a flourish
 thy boyish chivalry
 she has not appeared even yet said
lindesay who had now reached the midst

 the abbot
 the parlour or audience room how call
you this trifling 
patience my lord replied sir robert
time presses not and lord ruthven hath
not as yet descended
at this moment the door the inner
apartment opened and queen mary presented
herself advancing with an air peculiar
grace and majesty and seeming totally
unruffled either by the visit or by the
rude manner in which it had been enforced
her dress was a robe black velvet a
small ruff open in front gave a full view
 her beautifully formed chin and neck but
veiled the bosom on her head she wore
a small cap lace and a transparent white
veil hung from her shoulders over the long
black robe in large loose folds so that it
could be drawn at pleasure over the face
and person she wore a cross gold
around her neck and had her rosary gold
and ebony hanging from her girdle she was
closely followed by her two ladies who remained
standing behind her during the conthe
abbot 
terence even lord lindesay though the
rudest noble that rude age was surprised
into something like respect by the unconcerned
and majestic mien her whom
he had expected to find frantic with impotent
passion or dissolved in useless and
vain sorrow or overwhelmed with the fears
likely in such a situation to assail fallen
royalty
 we fear we have detained you my
lord lindesay said the queen while
she curtsied with dignity in answer to his
reluctant obeisance but a female does
not willingly receive her visitors without
some minutes spent at the toilette men
my lord are less dependant on such ceremonies

lord lindsay casting his eye down on
his own travelstained and disordered dress
muttered something a hasty journey and
the queen paid her greeting to sir robert
melville with courtesy and even as
it seemed with kindness there was then
a dead pause during which lindesay 
the abbot
ed towards the door as if expecting with
impatience the colleague their embassy
the queen alone was entirely unembarrassed
and as if to break the silence she addressed
lord lindesay with a glance at the
large and cumbrous sword which he wore
as already mentioned hanging from his
neck
you have there a trusty and a weighty
travelling companion my lord i trust you
expected to meet with no enemy here
against whom such a formidable weapon
could be necessary it is methinks somewhat
a singular ornament for a court
though i am as i well need to be too
much a stuart to fear a sword
 it is not the first time madam replied
lindesay bringing round the weapon
so as to rest its point on the ground and
leaning one hand on the huge crosshandle
it is not the first time that this weapon
has intruded itself into the presence the
house stuart
 possibly my lord replied the queen
the abbot 
 it may have clone service to my ancestors
 your ancestors were men loyalty
 ay madam replied he service it
hath done but such as kings love neither
to acknowledge nor to reward it was the
service which the knife renders to the tree
when trimming it to the quick and depriving
it the superfluous growth rank
and unfruitful suckers which rob it nourishment

 you talk riddles my lord said mary 
i will hope the explanation carries nothing
insulting with it
 you shall judge madam answered
lindesay with this good sword was
archibald douglas earl angus girded
on the memorable day when he acquired
the name bellthereat for dragging from
the presence your greatgrandfather the
third james the race a crew minions
flatterers and favourites whom he hanged
over the bridge lauder as a warning to
such reptiles how they approach a scottish
throne with this same weapon the same
inflexible champion scottish honour and
 the abbot
nobility slew at one blow spent kilspin
die a courtier your grandfather james
the fourth who had dared to speak lightly
 him in the royal presence they fought
near the brook fall and bellthereat
with this blade sheared through the thigh
 his opponent and lopped the limb as
easily as a shepherd's boy slices a twig from
a sapling
 my lord replied the queen reddening
 my nerves are too good to be alarmed
even by this terrible history may i ask
how a blade so illustrious passed from the
house douglas to that lindesay 
methinks it should have been preserved asa
consecrated relique by a family who have
held all that they could do against their
king to be done in favour their country
nay madam said melville anxiously
interfering ask not that question lord
lindesay and you my lord for shame 
for decency forbear to reply to it
 it is time that this lady should hear the
truth replied lindesay
the abbot 
 and be assured that she will be moved
to anger by none that you can tell her my
lord there are cases in which just scorn
has always the mastery over just anger
 then know said lindesay that upon
the field carburyhill when that false
and infamous traitor and murtherer james
sometime earl both well and nicknamed
duke orkney offered to do personal
battle with any the associated nobles
who came to drag him to justice i accepted
his challenge and was by the noble
earl morton gifted with this good sword
that i might therewith fight it out ah so
help me heaven had his presumption been
one grain more or his cowardice one grain
less i should have done such work with
this good steel on his traitorous corpse that
the hounds and carrioncrows should have
found their morsels daintily carved to their
use 
the queen's courage well nigh gave way
to the mention bothwell's name a name
connected with such a train guilt shame
 the abbot
and disaster but the prolonged boast 
lindesay gave her time to rally herself and
to answer with an appearance cold contempt
 it is easy to slay an enemy who
enters not the lists but had mary stuart
inherited her father's sword as well as his
sceptre the boldest her rebels should
not upon that day have complained that
they had no one to cope withal your
lordship will forgive me if i abridge this
conference a brief description a bloody
fight is long enough to satisfy a lady's curiosity
 and unless my lord lindesay has
something more important to tell us than 
the deeds which old bellthereat achieved
and how he would himself have emulated
them had time and tide permitted we will
retire to our private apartment and you
fleming shall finish reading to us yonder
little treatise des rhodomontade espag
nobles
tarry madam said lindesay his complexion
reddening in his turn i know
your quick wit too well old to have sought
the abbot 
an interview that yon might sharpen its
edge at the expence my honour lord
kuthven and myself with sir robert melville
as a concurrent come to your grace
on the part the secret council to tender
to you what much concerns the safety 
your own life and the welfare the state
the secret council said the queen 
by what powers can it subsist or act
while i from whom it holds its character
am here detained under unjust restraint 
but it matters not what concerns the welfare
 scotland shall be acceptable to mary
stuart come from whatsoever quarter it will
and for what concerns her own life she
has lived long enough to be weary it even
at the age twentyfive where is your
colleague my lord why tarries he 
he comes madam said melville and
lord ruthven entered at the instant holding
in his hand a packet as the queen
returned his salutation she became deadly
pale but instantly recovered herself by dint
 strong and sudden resolution just as the
 the abbot
noble whose appearance seemed to excite
such emotions in her bosom entered the
apartment in company with george douglas
the youngest son the knight 
lochleven who during the absence his
father and brethren acted as seneschal 
the castle under the direction the elder
lady lochleven his father's mother
the abbot 
chapter vii
i give this heavy weight from oflpmy heads
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand 
with mine own tears i wash away ray balm
with my own hand i give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
richard 
lord ruthven had the look and bearing
which became a soldier and a statesman
and the martial cast his form and features
procured him the popular epithet 
greysteil by which he was distinguished
by his intimates after the hero a metrical
romance then generally known his dress
which was a buffcoat embroidered had a
half military character but exhibited nothing
 the sordid negligence which distinguished
that lindesay but the son
 an illfated sire and the father a yet
 the abbot
more unfortunate family bore in his look
that cast inauspicious melancholy by
which the physiognomists that time pretended
to distinguish those who were predestined
to a violent and unhappy death
the terror which the presence this
nobleman impressed on the queen's mind
arose from the active share he had borne
in the slaughter david rizzio his father
having presided at the perpetration
 that abominable crime although so weak
from long and wasting illness that he could
not endure the weight his armour having
arisen from a sickbed to commit a
murther in the presence his sovereign
on that occasion his son also had attended
and taken an active part it was little
to be wondered at that the queen
considering her condition when such a
deed horror was acted in her presence
should retain an instinctive terror for the
principal actors in the mulier she returned
however with grace the salutation
 lord ruthven and extended her hand
the abbot 
to george douglas who kneeled and kissed
it with respect the first mark a subject's
homage which roland graeme had seen any
 them render to the captive sovereign she
returned his greeting in silence and there
was a brief pause during which the steward
 the castle a man a sad brow and a severe
eye placed under george douglas's
directions table and writing materials and
the page obedient to his mistress's dumb
signal advanced a large chair to the side on
which the queen stood the table thus forming
a sort bar which divided the queen
and her personal followers from her unwelcome
visitors the steward then withdrew
after a low reverence when he had closed
the door behind him the queen broke silences
with your favour my lords i
will sit my walks are not indeed extensive
enough at present to fatigue me greatly
yet i find repose something more necessary
than usual
she sate down accordingly and shading
her cheek with her beautiful hand looked
 the abbot
keenly and impressively at each the nobles
in turn mary fleming applied her
kerchief to her eyes and catherine seyton
and roland graeme exchanged a glance
which showed that both were too deeply
engrossed with sentiments interest and
commiseration for their royal mistress to
think any thing which regarded themselves

 i wait your business my lords said
the queen after she had been seated for
about a minute without a word being spoken
 i wait your message from those you
call the secret council i trust it is a petition
 pardon and a desire that i will
resume my rightful throne without using
with due severity my right punishing
those vvho have dispossessed me it
madam replied ruthven it is painful
for us to speak harsh truths to a princess
who has long ruled us but we come to
offer not to implore pardon in a word
madam we have to propose to you on the
the abbot 
part the secret council that you sign
these deeds which will contribute greatly
to the pacification the state the advancement
 god's word and the welfare your
own future life
 am i expected to take these fair words
on trust my lord or may i hear the contents
 these reconciling papers ere i am
asked to sign them
 unquestionably madam it is our purpose
and wish you should read what you
are required to sign replied ruthven
 required replied the queen with
some emphasis but the phrase suits well
the matter read my lord
the lord ruthven proceeded to read a
formal instrument running in the queen's
name and setting forth that she had been
called at an early age to the administration
 the crown and realm scotland and had
toiled diligently therein until she was in
body and spirit so wearied out and disgusted
that she was unable any longer to endure
the travail and pain state affairs j and
 the abbot
that since god blessed her with a fair and
hopeful son she was desirous to ensure to
 him even while she yet lived his succession
to the crown which was his by right hereditary
descent wherefore the instrument
proceeded we the motherly affection
we bear to our said son have renounced
and demitted and by these our
letters free good will renounce and demit
the crown government and guiding the
realm scotland in favour our said son
that he may succeed to us as native prince
thereof as much as if we had been removed
by decease and not by our own proper act
and that this demission our royal authority
may have the more full and solemn effect
and none pretend ignorance we give
grant and commit full and free and plain
power to our trusty cousins lord lindesay
 the byres and william lord ruthven
to appear in our name before as many 
the nobility clergy and burgesses as maybe
assembled at stirling and there in our
name and behalf publicly and in their prethe
abbot 
sence to renounce the crown guidance
and government this our kingdom 
scotland
the queen here broke in with an air 
extreme surprise how is this my lords
she said are my ears turned rebels that
they deceive me with sounds so extraordinary
 and yet it is no wonder that having
conversed so long with rebellion they
should now force its language upon my understanding
 say i am mistaken my lords
say for the honour yourselves and
the scottish nobility my right trusty cousins
 lindesay and ruthven two barons
 warlike fame and ancient line have not
sought the prisonhouse their kind mistress
for such a purpose as these words seem
to imply say for the sake honour and
loyalty that my ears have deceived me
 no madam said ruthven gravely
 your ears do not deceive you they deceived
you when they were closed against
the preachers the evangelic and the 
the abbor
nest advice your faithful subjects j and
when they were ever open to flattery 
pickthanks and traitors foreign circulars
and domestic minions the land may no
longer brook the rule one who cannot
rule herself wherefore i pray you to comply
with the last remaining wish your
subjects and counsellors and spare yourself
and us the further agitation matter so
painful
and is this all my loving subjects require
 me my lord said mary in a tone
 bitter irony do they really stint
themselves to the easy boon that i should
yield up the crown which is mine by birthright
to an infant which is scarcely more
than a year old fling down my sceptre
and take up a distaff o no it is too little
for them to ask that other roll parchment
contains something harder to be complied
with and which may more highly tax
my readiness to comply with the petitions
 my lieges
this parchment answered ruthven
the abbot 
in the same tone inflexible gravity and
unfolding the instrument as he spoke is
one by which your grace constitutes your
nearest in blood and the most honourable
and trustworthy your subjects james
earl murray regent the kingdom
during the minority the young king
he already holds the appointment from the
secret council
the queen gave a sort shriek and
clapping her hands together exclaimed
comes the arrow out his quiver out
 my brother's bow alas i looked for
his return from france as my sole at least
my readiest chance deliverance and
yet when i heard that he had assumed the
government i guessed he would shame to
wield it in my name
 i must pray your answer madam said
lord ruthven to the demand the
council
 the demand the council said the
queen say rather the demand a set
vol k
 the abbot
 robbers impatient to divide the spoil
they have seized to such a demand and
sent by the mouth a traitor whose scalp
but for my womanish mercy should long
since have stood on the city gates mary 
scotland has no answer
 i trust madam said lord ruthven
my being unacceptable to your presence
will not add to your obduracy resolution
it may become you to remember that
the death the minion rizzio cost the
house ruthven its head and leader my
father more worthy than a whole province
 such vile sycophants died in exile and
brokenhearted
the queen clasped her hands on her
face and resting her arms on the table
stooped down her head and wept so bitterly
that the tears were seen to find their
way in streams between the white and slender
fingers with which she endeavoured to
conceal them
 my lords said sir robert melville
 this is too much rigour under your
the abbot 
lordships favour we came hither not to revive
old griefs but to find the mode 
avoiding new ones
 sir robert melville said ruthven
we best know for what purpose we were
delegated hither and wherefore you were
somewhat unnecessarily sent to attend us
nay by my hand said lord lindsay
 i know not why we were cumbered
with the good knight unless he comes in
place the lump sugar which pothicars
put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments
to please a froward child a needless
labour methinks where men have the
means to make them swallow the physic
otherwise
 nay my lords said melville rye best
know your own secret instructions i conceive
i shall best obey mine in striving to
mediate between her grace and you
be silent sir robert melville said
the queen arising and her face still glowing
with agitation as she spoke my kerchief
fleming i shame that traitors should
 the abbot
have power to move me thus tell me
proud lords she added wiping away the
tears as she spoke by what earthly warrant
can liege subjects pretend to challenge the
rights an anointed sovereign to throw
off the allegiance they have vowed and to
take avay the crown from the head on
which divine warrant hath placed it 
 madam said ruthven i will deal
plainly with you your reign from the dismal
field pinkieclench when you were
a babe in the cradle till now that ye
stand a grown dame before us hath been
such a tragedy losses disasters civil dissentions
and foreign wars that the like is
not to be found in our chronicles the
french and english have one consent
made scotland the battlefield on which to
fight out their own ancient quarrel for
ourselves every man's hand hath been
against his brother nor hath a year passed
over without rebellion and slaughter exile
 nobles and oppressing the commons
we may endure it no longer and therethe
abbot 
fore as a prince to whom god hath refused
the gift hearkening to wise counsel
and on whose dealings and projects no
blessing hath ever descended we pray you
to give way to other rule and governance
 the land that a remnant may yet be saved
to this distracted realm
 my lord said mary it seems to me
that you fling on my unhappy and devoted
head those evils which with far more justice
 may impute to your own turbulent
wild and untameable dispositionsthe frantic
violence with which you the magnates
 scotland enter into feuds against each
other sticking at no cruelty to gratify your
wrath taking deep revenge for the slightest
offences and setting at defiance those
wise laws which your ancestors made for
staunching such cruelty rebelling against
the lawful authority and bearing yourselves
as if there where no king in the land or rather
as if each were king in his own premises
and now you throw the blame on
 the abbot
me on me whose life has been embittered
 whose sleep has been broken whose
happiness has been wrecked by your dissentions
have i not myself been obliged to
traverse wilds and mountains at the head
 a few faithful followers to maintain peace
and to put down oppression have i not
worn harness on my person and carried
pistols at my saddle j fain to lay aside the
softness a woman and the dignity a
queen that i might show an example to
my followers 
i we grant madam said lindesay rudely
 that the affrays occasioned by your
misgovernment may sometimes have startled
you in the midst a masque or galliard
 or it may be that such may have interrupted
the idolatry the mass or the
jesuitical counsels some french ambassador
but the longest and severest journey
which your grace has taken in my memory
was from hawick to hermitage castle
j and whether it was for the weal the
the abbot sl
state or for your own honour rests with
your grace's conscience
the queen turned to him with inexpressible
sweetness tone and manner and
that engaging look which heaven had assigned
her as if to shew that the choicest
arts to win men's affections may be given
in vain lindesay she said you spoke
not to me in this stern tone and with such
scurril taunt yon fair summer evening when
you and i shot at the butts against the earl
 mar and mary livingstone and won 
them the evening's collation in the privy
garden saint andrews the master 
lindesay was then my friend and vowed
to be my soldier how i have offended the
lord lindesay i know not unless honours
have changed manners
hardhearted as he was lindesay seemed
struck with this unexpected appeal but almost
instantly replied madam it is well
known that your grace could in those days
make fools whomsoever approached you
 the abbot
i pretend not to have been wiser than
others but gayer men and better courtiers
soon jostled aside my rude homage and i
think your grace cannot but remember
times when my awkward attempts to take
the manners that pleased you were the sport
 the courtpopinjays the maries and the
frenchwomen
 my lord i grieve if i have offended you
through idle gaiety said the queen and
can but say it was most unwittingly done
you are fully revenged for through gaiety
she said with a sigh will i never offend
any one more
our time is wasting madam said
lord ruthven j i must pray your decision
on this weighty matter which i have
submitted to you
 what my lord said the queen upon
the instant and without a moment's time to
deliberate can the council as they term
themselves expect this me 
madam replied ruthven the count
abbot 
cil hold the opinion that since the fatal
term which passed betwixt the night 
king henry's murder and the day 
your grace should have held you
prepared for the measure now proposed as
the easiest escape from your numerous dangers
and difficulties
 great god exclaimed the queen 
and is it as a boon that you propose tome
what every christian king ought to regard
as a loss honour equal to the loss 
life you take from me my crown my
power my subjects my wealth my state
what in the name every saint can you
offer or do you offer in requital my compliance

 we give you pardon answered rutheven
sternly we give you space and means
to spend your remaining life in penitence
and seclusion we give you time to make
your peace with heaven and to receive the
pure gospel which you have ever rejected
and persecuted
k 
sic the abbot
the queen turned pale at the menace
which this speech as well as the rough and
inflexible tones the speaker seemed distinctly
to infer and if i do not comply
with your request so fiercely urged my
lord what then follows 
she said this in a voice in which female
and natural fear was contending with the
feelings insulted dignity there was a
pause as if no one cared to return to the
question a distinct answer at length rutheven
spoke there is little need to tell
to your grace who are well read both in
the laws and in the chronicles the realm
that murder and adultery are crimes for
which ere now queens themselves have suffered
death
and where ray lord or how found you
an accusation so horrible against her who
stands before you said queen mary
 the foul and odious calumnies which
have poisoned the general mind scotland
and placed me a helpless prisoner in
your hands are surely no proof guilt
the abbot 
we need look for no farther proof than
the shameless marriage betwixt the widow
 the murdered and the leader the band
 murderers they that joined hands in
the fated month may had already united
hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded
that marriage but a few brief weeks
my lord my lord said the queen
eagerly remember well there were more
consents than mine went to that fatal union
that most unhappy act a most unhappy
life the evil steps adopted by sovereigns
are often the suggestion bad counsellors
but these counsellors are worse than fiends
who tempt and betrays they themselves are
the first to call their unfortunate princes to
answer for the consequences their own
advice heard ye never a bond by the
nobles my lords recommending that illfated
union to the illfated mary methinks
were it carefully examined we should see
that the names morton and lindesay
and ruthven may be found in that bond
i 
s the abbot
which pressed me to marry that unhappy
man ah stout and loyal lord berries
who never knew guile or dishonour you
bent your noble knee to me in vain to
warn me my danger and wert yet the first
to draw thy good sword in my cause when i
suffered for neglecting thy counsel faithful
knight and true noble what a difference
betwixt thee and those counsellors evil
who now threaten my life for having fallen
into the snares they spread for me 
 madam said ruthven we know that
you are an orator and perhaps for that reason
the council has sent hither men whose
converse hath been more with the wars than
with the language the schools or the cabals
 state we but desire to know if on
assurance life and honour ye will demit
the rule this kingdom scotland 
 and what warrant have i said the
queen that ye will keep treaty with me
if i should barter my kingly estate for seclusion
and leave to weep in secret 
the abbor 
 our honour and our word madam
answered ruthven
they are too slight and unsold pledges
my lord said the queen add at
least a handful thistledown to give them
weight in the balance
away ruthven said lindesay she
was ever deaf to counsel save slaves and
sycophants let her remain by her refusal
and abide by it
stay my lord said sir robert melville
 or rather permit me to have but a
few minutes private audience with her
grace if my presence with you could
avail aught it must be as a mediator do
not i conjure you leave the castle or
break off the conference until i bring you
word how her grace shall finally stand disposed

 we will remain in the hall said lindsay
 for half an hour's space but in despising
our words and our pledge honour
she has touched the honour my name 
s the abbot
let her look herself to the course she has to
pursue if the half hour should pass away
without her determining to comply with
the demands the nation her career will
be brief enough
with little ceremony the two nobles left
the apartment traversed the vestibule and
descended the windingstairs the clash 
lindesay's huge sword being heard as it rang
against each step in his descent george
douglas followed them after exchanging
with melville a gesture surprise and sympathy

as soon as they were gone the queen
again giving way to grief fear and agitation
threw herself into the seat wrung her
hands and seemed to abandon herself to
despair her female attendants weeping
themselves endeavoured yet to pray hero
be composed and sir robert melville
kneeling at her feet made the same entreaty
after giving way to a passionate
burst sorrow she at length said to melthe
abbot 
ville kneel not to me melville mock
me not with the homage the person when
the heart is far away why stay you behind
with the deposed the condemned her who
has but few hours perchance to live you
have been favoured as well as the rest j why
do you continue the empty show gratitude
and thankfulness any longer than they 
 madam said sir robert melville so
help me heaven at my need my heart is as
true to you as when you were in your highest
place
 true to me true to me repeated the
queen with some scorn j tush melville
what signifies the truth which walks hand
in hand with my enemies falsehood thy
hand and thy sword have never been so well
acquainted that i can trust thee in aught
where manhood is required o seyton for
thy bold father who is both wise true and
valiant 
roland graeme could withstand no longer
his earnest desire to offer his services to a
 the abbot
princess so distressed and so 
one sword he said madam can do
any thing to back the wisdom this grave
counsellor or to defend your rightful cause
here is my weapon and here is my hand
ready to draw and use it and raising his
sword with the one hand he laid the other
upon the hilt
as he thus held up the weapon catherine
seyton exclaimed methinks i see a
token from my father madam and immediately
crossing the apartment she took
roland graeme by the skirt the cloak
and asked him earnestly whence he had
that sword
the page answered with surprise methinks
this is no presence in which to jest 
surely damsel you yourself best know
whence and how i obtained the weapon
 is this a time for folly said catherine
seyton unsheathe the sword instantly 
if the queen commands me said the
youth looking towards his royal mistress
the abbot s
 for shame maiden said the queen j
 wouldst thou instigate the poor boy to
enter into useless strife with the two most
approved soldiers in scotland 
in your grace's cause replied the
page i will venture my life upon them 
and as he spoke he drew his weapon partly
from the sheath and a piece parchment
rolled around the blade fell out and dropped
on the floor catherine seyton caught
it up with eager haste
 it is my father's hand writing she
said and doubtless conveys his best duteous
advice to your majesty i knew that
it was prepared to be sent in this weapon
but i expected another messenger
by my faith fair one thought roland
and if you knew not that i had such a secret
missive about me i was yet more ignorant

the queen cast her eye upon the scroll
and remained a few minutes wrapped in
deep thought sir robert melville she
 the abbot
at length said this scroll advises me to
submit myself to necessity and to subscribe
the deeds these hard men have brought with
them as one who gives way to the natural
fear inspired by the threats rebels and
murtherers you sir robert are a wiseman
and seyton is both sagacious and
brave neither i think would mislead
me in this matter
madam said melville if i have not
the strength body the lords berries or
seyton i will yield to neither in zeal for
your majesty's service i cannot fight for
you like these lords but neither them
are more willing to die for your service
i believe it my old and faithful counsellor
said the queen and believe me
melville i did thee but a moment's injustice
read what my lord seyton hath
written to us and give us thy best counsel
he glanced over the parchment and instantly
replied o my dear and royal
mistress only treason itself could give you
other advice than lord seyton has here
the abbot 
expressed he berries huntley the english
ambassador throgmorton and others
your friends are all alike opinion that
whatever deeds or instruments you execute
within these walls must lose all force and
effect as extorted from your grace by dress
by sufferance present evil and fear
 men and harm to ensue on your refusal
yield therefore to the tide and be assured
that in subscribing what parchments they
presenttoyou you bind yourself to nothing
since your act signature wants that which
alone can make it valid the free will 
the granter
 ay so says my lord seyton replied
mary yet methinks for the daughter 
so long a line sovereigns to resign her
birth right because rebels press upon her
with threats argues little royalty and
will read ill for the fame mary in future
chronicles tush sir robert melville
the traitors may use black threats and bold
words but they will not dare to put their
hands forth on our person
 the abbot
alas madam they have already dared
so far and incurred such peril by the lengths
which they have gone that they are but one
step from the worst and uttermost
 surely said the queen her fears again
predominating scottish nobles would not
lend themselves to assassinate a helpless
woman 
 bethink you madam he replied
 what horrid spectacles have been seen
in our day and what act is so dark that
some scottish hand has not been found to
dare it lord lindesay besides his natural
sullenness and hardness temper is the
near kinsman henry darnley and rutheven
has his own deep and dangerous plans
the council besides speak proofs by
writ and word a casket with letters 
i know not what
ah good melville answered the
queen were i as sure the evenhanded
integrity my judges as my own
innocence and yet
 oh pause madam said melville j
the abbot 
 even innocence must sometimes for a
season stoop to injurious blame besides
you are here
he looked round and paused
 speak out melville said the queen
 never one approached my person who
wished to work me evil and even this poor
page whom i have today seen for the first
time in my life i can trust safely with your
communication
 nay madam answered melville in
such emergence and he being the bearer
 lord seyton's message i will venture to
say before him and these fair ladies whose
truth and fidelity i dispute not i say i will
venture to say that there are other modes
besides that open trial by which deposed
sovereigns often die and that as machiavel
saith there is but one step betwixt a
king's prison and his grave
oh were it but swift and easy for the
body said the unfortunate princess were
it but safe and happy change for the soul
the woman lives not that would take the
 the abbot
step so soon as i but alas melville
when we think death a thousand sins
which we have trode as worms beneath our
feet rise up against us as flaming serpents
most injuriously do they accuse me being
aiding darnley death yet blessed
lady i afforded too open occasion for the
suspicion i espoused bothwell
think not that now madam said
melville think rather the immediate
mode saving yourself and son comply
with their present unreasonable demands
and trust that better times will shortly arrives

 madam said roland graeme if it
pleases you that i should do so i will presently
swim through the lake if they refuse
me other conveyance to the shore i will
go to the courts successively england
france and spain and will shew you have
subscribed these vile instruments from no
stronger impulse than the fear death
and i will do battle against them that say
otherwise
the abbot 
the queen turned her round and with
one those sweet smiles which during the
era life's romance overpay every risk
held her hand towards roland but without
speaking a word he kneeled reverently
and kissed it and melville again resumed
his plea
 madam he said time presses and you
must not let these boats which i see they are
even now preparing put forth on the lake
here are enough witnesses your ladies
this bold youth myself when it can serve
your cause effectually for i would not hastily
stand committed in this matter but
even without me here is evidence enough
to shew that you have yielded to the demands
 the council through force and
fear but from no sincere and unconstrained
assent their boats are already manned
for their return oh permit your old servant
to recal them
 melville said the queen thou art
an ancient courtier when didst thou ever
know a sovereign prince recal to his presto
the abbot
sence subjects who had parted from him on
such terms as those on which these envoys
 the council left us and who yet were
recalled without submission or apology 
let it cost me both life and crown i will
not again command them to my presence
alas madam that empty form should
make a barrier if i rightly understand you
are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous
counsel but your scruple is saved
i hear them return to ask your final resolution
 o take the advice the noble
seyton and you may once more command
those who now usurp a triumph over you
but hush i hear them in the vestibule
as he concluded speaking george douglas
opened the door the apartment and
marshalled in the two noble envoys
 we come madam said the lord
ruthven to request your answer to the
proposal the council
 your final answer said lord lindesay
for with a refusal you must couple the
certainty that you have precipitated your
the abbot 
fate and renounced the last opportunity 
making peace with god and ensuring your
longer abode in the world
my lords said mary with inexpressible
grace and dignity the evils we cannot
resist we must submit to i will subscribe
these parchments with such liberty choice
as my condition permits me were i on
yonder shore with a fleet jennet and ten
good and loyal knights around me i would
subscribe my sentence eternal condemnation
as soon as the resignation my
throne but here in the castle cochlea
with deep water around me and you
my lords beside me i have no freedom 
choice give me the pen melville and bear
witness to what i do and why i do it
 it is our hope your grace will not suppose
yourself compelled by any apprehensions
from us said the lord ruthven to
execute what must be your own voluntary
deed
the queen had already stooped towards
the table and placed the parchment before
vol l
 the abbot
her with the pen between her fingers ready
for the important act signature but
when lord ruthven had done speaking she
looked up stopped short and threw down
the pen if said she i am expected
to declare i give away my crown freewill
or otherwise than because i am compelled
to renounce it by the threat worse
evils to myself and my subjects i will not
put my name to such an untruth not to
gain full possession england france and
scotland all once my own in possession or
by right
beware madam said lindesay and
snatching hold the queen's arm with his
own gauntlets hand he pressed it in the
rudeness his passion more closely perhaps
than he was himself aware beware
how you contend with those who are
the stronger and have the mastery your
fate
he held his grasp on her arm bending
his eyes on her with a stern and intimidating
look till both ruthven and melthe
abbot 
ville cried shame and douglas who had
hitherto remained in a state apparent
apathy had made a stride from the door as
if to interfere the rude baron then quitted
his hold disguising the confusion which
he really felt at having indulged his passion
to such extent under a sullen and contemptuous
smile
the queen immediately began with an
expression pain to bare the arm which
he had grasped by drawing up the sleeve 
her gown and it appeared that his grasp
had left the purple marks his iron fingers
upon her flesh my lord she said asa
knight and gentleman you might have
spared my frail arm so severe a proof that
you have the greater strength on your side
and are resolved to use it but i thank
you for itit is the most decisive token 
the terms on which this day's business is to
rest i draw you to witness both lords and
ladies she said shewing the marks the
grasp on her arm that i subscribe these
instruments in obedience to the sign manual
 the abbot
 my lord lindesay which you may
see imprinted on mine arm
lindesay would have spoken but was restrained
by his colleague ruthven who said
to him peace my lord let the lady
mary scotland ascribe her signature to
what she will it is our business to procure
it and to carry it to the council should
there be debate hereafter on the manner in
which it was exhibited there will be time
enough for it
lindesay was silent accordingly only
muttering within his beard i meant not
to hurt her but i think women's flesh be as
tender as newfallen snow
the queen meanwhile subscribed the
rolls parchment with a hasty indifference
as if they had been matters slight consequence
or mere formality when she had
performed this painful task she arose and
having curtsied to the lords was about to
withdraw to her chamber ruthven and
sir robert melville made the first a formal
reverence the second an obeisance in
the abbot 
which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy
was obviously checked by the fear 
appearing in the eyes his colleagues too
partial to his former mistress but lindsay
stood motionless even when they were
preparing to withdraw at length as if
moved by a sudden impulse he walked
round the table which had hitherto been
betwixt them and the queen kneeled on
one knee took her hand kissed it let it
fall and arose lady he said thou
art a noble creature even though thou
hast abused god's choicest gifts i pay that
devotion to thy manliness spirit which
i would not have paid to the power thou
hast long unreservedly wielded i kneel to
mary stuart not tb the queen
 the queen and mary stuart pity thee
alike lindesay said mary alike they
pity and they forgive thee an honoured soldier
hadst thou been by aking's side leagued
with rebels what art thou but a good blade
in the hands a ruffian farewell my
lord ruthven the smoother but the deeper
 the abbot
traitor farewell melville mayst thou
find masters that can understand state policy
better and have the means to reward
it more richly than mary stuart farewell
george douglas make your respected
grand'dame comprehend that we would be
alone for the remainder the day god
wot we have need to collect our thoughts
all bowed and withdrew but scarce had
they entered the vestibule ere ruthven
and lindesay were at variance chide
not with me ruthven lindesay was heard
to say in answer to something more indistinctly
urged by his colleague chide not
with me for i will not brook it you put
the hangman's office on me in this matter
and even the very hangman hath leave to
ask some pardon those on whom he does
his office i would i had as deep cause to
be this lady's friend as i have to be her enemy
 thou shouldst see if i spared limb and
life in her quarrel
thou art a sweet minion said rutheven
 to fight a lady's quarrel and all for
the abbot 
a brent brow and a tear in the eye such
toys have been out thy thoughts this
many a year
 do me right ruthven said lindesay
you are like a polished corslet steel it
shines more gaudily but it is not a whit
softer nay it is five times harder than a
glasgow breastplate hammered iron
enough we know each other
they descended the stairs were heard
to summon their boats and the queen signed
to roland graeme to retire to the vestibule
and leave her with her female attendants

 the abbot
chapter viii
give me a morsel on the greensward rather
coarse as you will the cooking let the fresh spring
bubble beside my napkin sand the free birds
twittering and chirping hop from bough to bough
to claim the crumbs i leave for perquisites 
your prisonfeasts i like not 
the woodsman a drama
a recess in the vestibule was enlightened
by a small window at which roland
graeme stationed himself to mark the departure
 the lords he could see their
followers mustering on horseback under
their respective banners the western sun
glancing on their corslet and steel caps as
they moved to and fro mounted or dismounted
at intervals on the narrow space
betwixt the castle and the water the lords
bwuthven and lindesay were already moving
the abbot 
slowly to their boats accompanied by the
lady lochleven her grandson and their
principal attendants they took a ceremonious
leave each other as roland could
discern by their gestures and the boats put
c from the landingplace the boatmen
stretched to their oars and they speedily
diminished upon the eye the idle gazer
who had no better employ ment than to watch
their motions such seemed also the occupation
 the lady lochleven and george
douglas who returning from the landingplace
looked frequently back to the boats
and at length stopped as if to observe their
progress under the window at which roland
graeme was stationed as they gazed on
the lake he could hear the lady distinctly
say and she has bent her mind to save
her life at the expence her kingdom r
her life madam replied her son i
know not who would dare to attempt it
in the castle my father had i dreamt
that it was with such purpose that lindesay
l 
 the abbot
insisted on bringing his followers hither
neither he nor they should have passed the
iron gate lochleven castle
 i speak not private slaughter my
son but open trial condemnation and
execution for with such she has been threatened
and to such threats she has given way
had she not had more the false russian
blood than the royal race scotland in
her veins she had bidden them defiance to
their teeth but it is all the same complexion
and meanness is the natural companion
 profligacy i am discharged forsooth
from intruding on her gracious presence
this evening go thou my son and
render the usual service the meal to this
unqueened queen
so please you lady mother said douglas
 i care not greatly to approach her
presence
 thou art right my son and therefore
i trust thy prudence even because i have
noted thy caution she is like an isle on the
the abbot 
ocean surrounded with shelves and quicksands
its verdure fair and inviting to the eye
but the wreck many a goodly vessel which
hath approached it too rashly but for thee
my son i fear nought and we may not
with our honour suffer her to eat without
the attendance one us she may die
by the judgment heaven or the fiend
may have power over her in her despair 
and then we would be touched in honour
to shew that in our house and at our table
she had had all fair play and fitting usage
here roland was interrupted by a smart
tap on the shoulders reminding him sharply
 adam woodcock's adventure the
preceding evening he turned round almost
expecting to see the page saint
michael's hostelry he saw indeed catherine
seyton but she was in female attire
differing indeed a great deal in shape and
materials from that which she had worn
when they first met and becoming her
birth as the daughter a great baron and
 the abbot
her rank as the attendant on a princess
 so fair page said she eaves dropping
is one your page like qualities i presume
 fair sister answered roland in the
same tone if some friends mine be as
well acquainted with the rest our mystery
as they are with the arts swearing
swaggering and switching they need ask
no page in christendom for further insight
into his vocation
 unless that pretty speech infer that
you have yourself had the discipline the
switch since we last met the probability
whereof i nothing doubt i profess fair
page i am at a loss to conjecture your
meaning but there is no time to debate
it now they come with the evening meal
be pleased sir page to do your duty
four servants entered bearing dishes
preceded by the same stern old steward
whom roland had already seen and followed
by george douglas already mentioned
as the grandson the lady lochleven
and who acting as seneschal replete
abbot 
seated upon this occasion his father the
lord the castle he entered with his
arms folded on his bosom and his looks
bent on the ground with the assistance
 roland grasme a table was suitably covered
in the next or middle apartment on
which the domestics placed their burthens
with great reverence the steward and douglas
bending low when they had seen the
table properly adorned as if their royal prisoner
had sate at the board in question the
door opened and douglas raising his eyes
hastily cast them again on the earth when
he perceived it was only the lady mary
fleming who entered
her grace she said will not eat
tonight
 let us hope she may be otherwise persuaded
said douglas meanwhile madam
please to see our duty performed
a servant presented bread and salt on a
silver plate and the old steward carved for
douglas a small morsel in succession from
each the dishes presented which he
 the abbot
tasted as was then the custom at the tables
 princes to which death was often
suspected to find its way in the disguise 
food
the queen will not then come forth
tonight said douglas
 she has so determined replied the
lady
 our further attendance then is unnecessary
 we leave you to your supper fair
ladies and wish you good even
he retired slowly as he came and with
the same air deep dejection and was
followed by the attendants belonging to
the castle the two ladies sate down to
their meal and poland greene with ready
alacrity prepared to wait upon them catherine
seyton whispered her companion
who replied with the question spoken in a
low tone but looking at the page is he
 gentle blood and well nurtured 
the answer which she received seemed
satisfactory for she said to roland sit
the abbot 
down young gentleman and eat with your
sisters in captivity
 permit me rather to perform my duty
in attending them said roland anxious
to shew he was possessed the high tone
 deference prescribed by the rules chivalry
towards the fair sex and especially to
dames and maidens quality
you will find sir page said catherine
you will have little time allowed you for
your meal waste it not in ceremony or you
may rue your politeness ere tomorrow
morning
 your speech is too free maiden said
the elder lady the modesty the youth
may teach you more fitting fashions towards
one whom today you have seen for the first
time
catherine sey ton cast down her eyes but
not till she had given a single glance inexpressible
archness towards roland whom
her more grave companion now addressed
in a tone protection
 the abbot
 regard her not young gentleman 
she knows little the world save the forms
 a country nunnerystake thy place at the
board and refresh thyself after thy
journey
roland graeme obeyed willingly as it
was the first food he had that day tasted j
for lindesay and his followers seemed regardless
 human wants yet notwithstanding
the sharpness his appetite a natural
gallantry disposition the desire 
shewing himself a wellnurtured gentleman
in all courtesies towards the fair sex and
for aught i know the pleasure assisting
catherine seyton kept his attention awake
during the meal to all those nameless acts
 duty and service which gallants that
age were accustomed to render he carved
with neatness and decorum and selected
duly whatever was most delicate to place
before the ladies ere they could form a
wish he sprung from the table ready to
comply with it poured wine tempered
the abbot 
it with water removed and exchanged
trenchers and performed the whole honours
 the table with an air at once 
cheerful diligence profound respect and
graceful promptitude
when he observed that they had finished
eating he hastened to offer to the elder
lady the silver ewer basin and napkin
with the ceremony and gravity which
he would have used towards mary herself
he next with the same decorum having
supplied the basin with fair water presented
it to catherine seyton apparently
she was determined to disturb his selfpossession
if possible for while in the act 
bathing her hands she contrived as it were
by accident to flirt some drops water
upon the face the assiduous assistant
but if such was her mischievous purpose
she was completely disappointed for roland
graeme internally piquing himself on
his selfcommand neither laughed nor was
discomposed and all that the maiden gained
by her frolic was a severe rebuke from
 the abbot
her companion taxing her with maladdress
and indecorum catherine replied not but
sat pouting something in the humour a
spoilt child who watches the opportunity
 wreaking upon some one or other its resentment
for a deserved reprimand j
the lady mary fleming in the meanwhile
was naturally well pleased with the
exact and reverent observance the page a
and said to catherine after a favourable
glance at roland graeme you might
well say catherine our companion in inactivity
was wellborn and gently nurtured i
i would not make him vain by my praise
but his services enable us to dispense with
those which george douglas condescends
not to afford us save when the queen is
herself in presence
humph i think hardly answered catherine
 george douglas is one the
most handsome gallants in scotland and
tis pleasure to see him even still when the
gloom lochleven castle has shed the
same melancholy over him that it has done
the abbot 
over every thing else when he was at
holyrood who would have said the young
sprightly george douglas would have been
contented to play the locksman here in
lochleven with no gayer amusement than
that turning the key on two or three
helpless women a strange office for a
knight the bleeding heart why does
he not leave it to his father or his brothers

perhaps like us he has no choice answered
the lady fleming but catherine
thou hast used thy brief space at court
well to remember what george douglas
was then
i used mine eyes which i suppose was
what i was designed to do and they were
worth using there when i was at the nunnery
they were very useless appurtenances
and now i am at lochleven they are good
for nothing save to look over that eternal
work embroidery
 you say thus when you have been but
 the abbot
a few brief hours amongst us was this the
maiden who would live and die in a dungeon
might she but have permission to wait
on her gracious queen 
nay if you chide in earnest my jest
is ended said catherine seyton i would
not yield in attachment to my poor godmother
to the gravest dame that ever had
wise saws upon her tongue and a doublestarched
ruff around her throat you know
i would not dame mary fleming and it
is putting shame on me to say otherwise 
she will challenge the other court lady
thought roland greene j she will to a certainty
fling down her glove and if dame
mary fleming hath but the soul to lift it
we may have a combat in the lists but the
answer lady mary fleming was such as
turns away wrath
 thou art a good child she said my
catherine and a faithful but heaven pity
him who shall have one day a creature so
beautiful to delight him and a thing so
the abbot l
mischievous to torment him thou art fit
to drive twenty husbands stark mad
 nay said catherine resuming the
full career her careless good humour
he must be halfwitted beforehand that
gives me such an opportunity but i am
glad you are not angry with me in sincerity
casting herself as she spoke into the
arms her friend and continuing with a
tone apologetic fondness while she kissed
her on either side the face you
know my dear fleming that i have to contend
with both my father's lofty pride and
with my mother's high spirit god bless
them they have left me these good qualities
having small portion to give beside as
times go and so i am wilful and saucy 
but let me remain but a week in this castle
and o my dear fleming my spirit will
be as chastised and as humble as thine
own
dame mary fleming's sense dignity
and love form could not resist this
 the abbot
affectionate appeal she kissed catherine
seyton in her turn affectionately while answering
the last part her speech she said
 now our lady forbid dear catherine
that you should lose aught that is beseeming
 what becomes so well your light heart
and lively humour keep but your sharp
wit on this side madness and it cannot
but be a blessing to us but let me go mad
wench i hear her grace touch her silver
call and extricating herself from catherine's
grasp she went towards the door 
queen mary from which was heard the
low tone a silver whistle which now only
used by the boatswains in the navy was
then for want bells the ordinary mode
by which ladies even the very highest
rank summoned their domestics when
she had made two or three steps towards
the door the queen's apartment however
she turned back and advancing to the
young couple whom she left together she
said in a very serious though a low tone
 i trust it is impossible that we can any 
the abbot 
us or in any circumstances forget that few
as we are we form the household the
queen scotland and that in her calamity
all boyish mirth and childish jesting
can only serve to give a great triumph to
her enemies who have already found their
account in objecting to her the lightness
 every idle folly that the young and the
gay practised in her court so saying she
left the apartment
catherine seyton seemed much struck
with this remonstrance she suffered herself
to drop into the seat which she had
quitted when she went to embrace dame
mary fleming and for some time rested
her brow upon her hands while roland
graeme looked at her earnestly with a mixture
 emotions which perhaps he himself
could neither have analyzed nor explained
as she raised her face slowly from the posture
to which a momentary feeling selfrebuke
had depressed it her eyes encountered
those roland and became gradually
animated with their usual spirit 
the abbot
pious drollery which not unnaturally exci 
ted a similar expression in those the 
equally volatile page they sat for the
space two minutes each looking at the 
other with great seriousness on their features
and much mirth in their eyes until 
at length catherine was the first to break
silence
 may i pray you fair sir she began
very demurely to tell me what you see
in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious
and knowing as those with which
it is your worship's pleasure to honour me i
it would seem as there were some wonderful
confidence and intimacy betwixt us fair
sir if one is to judge from your extremely
cunning looks and so help me our lady
as i never saw you but twice in my life before

and where were these happy occasions
said roland if i may be bold
enough to ask the question 
 at the nunnery saint catherine's
said the damsel in the first instance j and
the abbot 
in the second during five minutes a certain
raid or foray which it was your pleasure
to make into the lodging my lord
and father lord seyton from which to my
surprise as probably to your own you returned
with a token friendship and favour
instead broken bones which were
the more probable reward your intrusion
considering the prompt ire the house 
seyton i am deeply mortified she added
ironically that your recollection should
require refreshment on a subject so important
 and that my memory should be stronger
than yours on such an occasion is truly
humiliating
 your own memory is not so exactly
correct fair mistress answered the page
 seeing you have forgotten meeting the
third in the hostelry saint michael's
when it pleased you to lay your switch
across the face my comrade in order
i warrant to shew that in the house 
seyton neither the prompt ire its descendants
nor the use the doublet and
vol ir m
 the abbot
hose are subject to salique law or confined
to the use the males
fair sir answered catherine looking
at him with great steadiness and some surprise
 unless your fair wits have forsaken
you i am at a loss what to conjecture 
your meaning
by my troth fair mistress answered
roland and were i as wise a warlock as
michael scott i could scarce riddle the
dream you read me did i not see you last
night in the hostelry saint michael's 
did you not bring me this sword with command
not to draw it save at the command
 my native and rightful sovereign and
have i not done as you required me oris
the sword a piece lath mynvord a
bullrush my memory a dream and my
eyes good for nought spirals which corlies
might pick out my head 
and if your eyes serveyou not more
truly on other occasions than in your vision
 saint michael said catherine i know
not the pain apart that the cries would
the abbot l
do you any great injury in the deprivation
but hark the bell hush for god's sake
we are interrupted
the damsel was right for no sooner
had the dull toll the castle bell begun
to resound through the vaulted apartment
than the door the vestibule flew open
and the steward with his severe countenance
his gold chain and his white rod
entered the apartment followed by the
same train domestics who had placed
the dinner on the table and who now
with the same ceremonious formality began
to remove it
the steward remained motionless as
some old picture while the domestics did
their office and when it was accomplished
every thing removed from the table
and the board itself taken from its tresses
and disposed against the wall he said
aloud without addressing any one in particular
and somewhat in the tone a herald
reading a proclamation my noble
lady dame margaret erskine by marcs
the abbot
rage douglas lets the lady mary scotland
and her attendants to wit that a servant
 the true evangelic her reverend
chaplain will tonight as usual expound
lecture and catechize according to the
forms the congregation gospellers
 hark you my friend mr dryfesdale
said catherine i understand this announcement
is a nightly form yours
now i pray you to remark that the lady
fleming and i for i trust your insolent
invitation concerns us only have chosen
saint peter's pathway to heaven so i see
no one whom your godly exhortation catechize
or lecture can benefit excepting
this poor page who being in satan's hand
as well as yourself had better worship with
you than remain to cumber our betteradvised
devotions
the page was well nigh giving a round
denial to the assertion with this speech
implied when remembering what had passed
betwixt him and the regent and seeing
catherine's finger raised in a monitory
the abbot 
fashion he felt himself as on former occasions
at the castle avenel obliged to
submit to the task dissimulation and
followed clydesdale down to the castlechapel
where he assisted in the devotions
 the evening
the chaplain was named elias henderson
he was a man in the prime 
life and possessed good natural parts
carefully improved by the best education
which these times afforded to these qualities
were added a faculty close and
terse reasoning and at intervals a flow 
happy illustration and natural eloquence
the religious faith roland graeme as
we have already had opportunity to observe
rested on no secure basis but was
entertained rather in obedience to his
grandmother's behests and his secret desire
to contradict the chaplain avenel
castle than from any fixed or steady reliance
which he placed on the romish creed
his ideas had been late considerably enlarged
by the scenes he had passed through j
 the abbot
and feeling that there was shame in not understanding
something those political
disputes betwixt the professors the ancient
and the reformed faith he listened
with more attention than it had hitherto
been in his nature to yield on such occasions
to an animated discussion some
 the principal points difference betwixt
the churches so passed away the
first day in the castle lochleven and
those which followed it were for sometime
 a very monotonous and uniform
tenor
the abbot ll
chapter 
tis a weary life this
vaults overhead and grates and bars around me
and my sad hours spent with as sad companions
whose thoughts are brooding o er their own mischances
far far too deeply to take part in mine
the woodsman
the course life to which mary and
her little retinue were doomed was in the
last degree secluded and lonely varied only
as the weather permitted or rendered impossible
the queen's usual walk in the garden
or on the battlements the greater part 
the morning she wrought with her ladies at
those pieces needle work many which
still remain proofs her indefatigable application
at such hours the page was permitted
the freedom the castle and islet 
nay he was sometimes invited to attend
george douglas when he went a sporting
the abbot
ing upon the lake or on its margin j opportunities
 diversion which were only
clouded by the remarkable melancholy
which always seemed to brood on that gentleman's
brow and to mark his whole demeanour
 a sadness so profound that roland
never observed him to smile or to
speak any word unconnected with the immediate
object their exercise
the most pleasant part roland's day
was the occasional space which he was permitted
to pass in personal attendance on the
queen and her ladies together with the regular
dinnertime which he always spent
with dame mary fleming and catherine
seyton on these occasions he had frequent
occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive
imagination the latter damsel
who was unwearied in her contrivances to
amuse her mistress and to banish for a time
at least the melancholy which preyed on
her bosom she danced she sung she recited
tales ancient and modern times with
that heartfelt exertion talent which
the abbot 
the pleasure lies not in the vanity displaying
it to others but in the enthusiastic
consciousness that we possess it ourselves
and yet these high accomplishments were
mixed with an airof rusticity and hairbrained
vivacity which seemed rather to belong
to some village maid the coquette the
ring around the maypole than to the highbred
descendant an ancient baron a
touch audacity altogether shorts effrontery
and far less approaching to vulgarity
gave as it were a wildness to all that she did
and mary while defending her from some
occasional censure her grave companion
compared her to a trained singingbird escaped
from a cage which practises in all the
luxuriance freedom and in full possession
 the greenwood bough the airs which
it had learned during its earlier captivity
the moments which the page was permitted
to pass in the presence this fascinating
creature danced so rapidly away
that brief as they were they compensated
the weary dulness all the rest the day
m 
 the abt
the space indulgence however was
always brief nor were any private interviews
betwixt him and catherine permitted
or even possible whether it were some
special precaution respecting the queen's
household or whether it were her general
ideas propriety dame fleming seemed
particularly attentive to prevent the young
people from holding any separate correspondence
together and bestowed for catherine's
sole benefit in this matter the full
stock prudence and experience which she
had acquired when mother the queen's
maidens honour and by which she had
acquired their hearty hatred casual meetings
however could not be prevented unless
catherine had been more desirous 
shunning or roland graeme less anxious
in watching for them a smile a gibe
a sarcasm disarmed its severity by the
arch look with which it was accompanied
was all that time permitted to pass between
them on such occasions but such
passing interview neither afforded time nor
the abbot 
opportunity to renew the discussion the
circumstances attending their earlier acquaintance
nor to permit roland to investigate
more accurately the mysterious apparition
 the page in the purple velvet cloak
at the hostelry saint michael's
the winter's months slipped heavily away
and spring was already advanced when
roland graeme observed a gradual change
in the manners his fellow prisoners
having no business his own to attend
to and being like those his age education
and degree sufficiently curious concerning
what passed around he became by
degrees to suspect and finally to be convinced
that there was something in agitation
among his companions in captivity
to which they did not desire that he should
be privy nay he became almost certain
that by some means unintelligible to him
queen mary held correspondence beyond
the walls and waters which surrounded her
prisonhouse and that she nourished some
secret hope deliverance or escape in
the conversations betwixt her and her 
the abbot
tenants at which he was necessarily present
the queen could not always avoid
shewing that she was acquainted with the
events which were passing abroad in the
world and which he only heard through
her report he observed that she wrote
more and worked less than had been her
former custom and that as if desirous to lull
suspicion asleep she changed her manner
towards the lady lochleven into one more
gracious and which seemed to express a
resigned submission to her lot they
think i am blind he said to himself and
that i am unfit to be trusted because i am
so young or it may be because i was sent
hither by the regent well be it so 
they may be glad to confide in me in the
long run and catherine seyton for as saucy
as she is may find me as safe a confidant as
that sullen douglas whom she is always running
after it may be they are angry with
me for listening to master elias henderson 
but it was their own fault for sending me
there and if the man speaks truth and good
sense and preaches only the word god
the abbot 
he is as like to be right as either pope or
councils
it is probable that in this last conjecture
roland graeme had hit upon the real cause
why the ladies had not entrusted him with
their counsel he had late had several
conferences with henderson on the subject
 religion and had given him to understand
that he stood in need his instructions
although he had not thought there
was either prudence or necessity for confessing
that hitherto he had held the tenets 
the church rome
elias henderson a keen propagator 
the reformed faith had sought the seclusion
 lochleven castle with the express purpose
and expectation making converts
from rome amongst the domestics the
dethroned queen and confirming the faith 
those who already held the protestant doctrines
perhaps his hopes soared a little higher
and he might nourish some expectation
 a proselyte more distinguished in the person
 the deposed queen but the 
the abbot
tenacity with which she and her female au
tenants refused to see or listen to him
rendered such hope if he nourished it altogether
abortive
the opportunity therefore enlarging
the religious information roland
graeme and bringing him to a more due
sense his duties to heaven was hailed
by the good man as a door opened by
providence for the salvation a sinner
he dreamed not indeed that he was converting
a papist but such was the ignorance
which england displayed upon some
material points the reformed doctrine
that master henderson while praising his
docility to the lady lochleven and her
grandson seldom failed to add that his venerable
brother henry warden must be
now decayed in strength and in mind since
he found a catechumen his flock so ill
grounded in the principles his belief
for this indeed roland graeme thought it
was unnecessary to assign the true reason
which was his having made it a point 
the abbot 
honour to forget all that henry warden
taught him as soon as he was no longer
compelled to repeat it over as a lesson acquired
by rote the lessons his new instructor
if not more impressively delivered
were received by a more willing ear
and a more awakened understanding and
the solitude lochleven castle was favourable
to graver thoughts than the page
had hitherto entertained he wavered yet
indeed as one who was almost persuaded 
but his attention to the chaplain's instructions
procured him favour even with the
stern old dame herself and he was once or
twice but under great precaution permitted
to go to the neighbouring village 
kinross situated on the mainland to execute
some ordinary commission his unfortunate
mistress
for some time roland greene might be
considered as standing neuter betwixt the
two parties who inhabited the watergirdled
tower lochleven but as he rose in the
opinion the lady the castle and her
 the abbot
chaplain he perceived with great grief that
he lost ground in that mary and her female
allies
he came gradually to be sensible that
he was regarded as a spy upon their discourse
and that instead the ease with
which they had formerly conversed in his
presence without suppressing any the
natural feelings anger or sorrow or
mirth which the chance topic the moment
happened to call forth their talk was
now studiously restricted to the most indifferent
subjects and a studied reserve
observed even in their mode treating
these this obvious want confidence was
accompanied with a correspondent change
in their personal demeanour towards the
unfortunate page the queen who had
at first treated him with marked courtesy
now scarce spoke to him save to convey
some necessary command for her service
the lady fleming restricted her notice to
the most dry and distant expressions civility
and catherine seyton became bitthe
abbot 
ter in her pleasantries and shy cross and
petted in any intercourse they had together
what was yet more provoking he
saw or thought he saw marks intelligence
betwixt george douglas and the
beautiful catherine seyton and sharpened
by jealousy he wrought himself almost
into a certainty that the looks which they
exchanged conveyed matters deep and
serious import no wonder he thought if
courted by the son a proud and powerful
baron she can no longer spare a word
or look to the poor fortuneless page
in a word roland graeme's situation
became truly uncomfortable and his heart
naturally enough rebelled against the injustice
 this treatment which deprived him
 the only comfort which he had received
for submitting to a confinement in other respects
irksome he accused queen mary
and catherine seyton for concerning the
opinion dame fleming he was indifferent
 inconsistency in being displeased
with him on account the natural cones
the abbot
quinces an order their own why
did they send him to hear this overpowering
preacher the abbot ambrosius he
recollected understood the weakness 
their popish cause better when he enjoined
him to repeat within his miiid avert
and credos and paters all the while old
henry warden preached or lectured that
so he might secure himself against lending
even a momentary ear to his heretical
doctrine but i will endure this life no
longer said he to himself manfully j do
they suppose i would betray my mistress
because i see cause to doubt her religion
 that would be a serving as they
say the devil for god's sake i will forth
into the world he that serves fair ladies
may at least expect kind looks and kind
words and i bear not the mind a gentleman
to submit to cold treatment and
suspicion and a lifelong captivity besides
i will speak to george douglas tomorrow
when we go out together fishing
a sleepless night was spent in agitating
the abbot 
this magnanimous resolution and he arose
in the morning not perfectly decided in
his own mind whether he should abide by
it or not it happened that he was summoned
by the queen at an unusual hour
and just as he was about to go out with
george douglas he went to attend her
commands in the garden but as he had
his anglingrod in his hand the circumstance
announced his previous intention
and the queen turning to the lady fleming
said catherine must devise some
other amusement for us ma honneamiey our
discreet page has already made his party
for the day's pleasure
 said from the beginning answered
the lady fleming that your grace ought
not to rely on being favoured with the company
 a youth who has so many huguenot
acquaintances and has the means 
amusing himself far more agreeably than
with us
i wish said catherine her animated
features reddening with mortification that
 the abbot
his friends would sail away with him for
good and bring us in return a page if such
a thing can be found faithful to his queen
and to his religion
 one part your wishes may be granted
madam said roland graeme unable i
any longer to restrain his sense the treatment
which he received on all sides and 
he was about to add i heartily wish you
a companion in my room if such can be
found who is capable enduring women's 
caprices without going distracted luckily
he recollected the remorse which he had i
felt at having given way to the vivacity 
his temper upon a similar occasion and
closing his lips imprisoned until it died on
his tongue a reproach so misbecoming the
presence majesty
 why do you remain there said the
queen as if you were rooted to the parterre

 i but attend your grace's commands
said the page
 i have none to give you begone sir 
the abbot 
as he left the garden to go to the boat
he distinctly heard mary upbraid one her
attendants in these words you see to
what you have exposed us
this brief scene at once determined roland
graeme's resolution to quit the castle
if it were possible and to impart his resolution
to george douglas without loss 
time that gentleman in his usual mood
 silence sate in the stern the little skiff
which they used on such occasions trimming
his fishingtackle and from time to
time indicating by signs to greene who
pulled the oars which way he should row
when they were a furlong or two from the
castle roland rested on the oars and addressed
his companion somewhat abruptly
 i have something importance to say to
you under your pleasure fair sir
the pensive melancholy douglas's
countenance at once gave way to the eager
keen and startled look one who expects
to hear something deep and alarming
import
 the abbot
i am wearied to the very death this
castle lochleven continued roland
is that all said douglas i know
none its inhabitants who are much better
pleased with it
 ay but i am neither a native the
house nor a prisoner in it and so i may
reasonably desire to leave it
 you might desire to quit it with equal
reason answered douglas if you were
both the one and the other
but said roland greene i am not
only tired living in lochleven castle but
i am determined to quit it
that is a resolution more easily taken
than executed replied douglas
 not if yourself sir and your lady mother
chuse to consent answered the page
 you mistake the matter roland said
douglas you will find that the consent
 two other persons is equally essential 
that the lady mary your mistress and
that my uncle the regent who placed
you about her person and who will not
the abbot 
think it proper that she should change her
attendants so soon
 and must i then remain whether i will
or no demanded the page somewhat appalled
at a view the subject which would
have occurred sooner to a person more
experience
at least said george douglas you
must will to remain till my uncle wills to
dismiss you
 frankly said the page and speaking
to you as a gentleman who is incapable
 betraying me i will confess that if
i thought myself a prisoner here neither
walls nor water should confine me ions
frankly said douglas i could not
much blame you for the attempt yet for
all that my father or uncle or the earl or
any my brothers or in short any the
king's lords into whe hands you fell would
in such a case hang you like a dog or like a
sentinel who deserts his post and i promise
you that you will hardly escape them
but row towards saint serf's island there
 the abbot
is a breeze from the west and we will have
sport keeping to windward the isle where
the ripple is strongest we will speak more
 what you have mentioned when we have
had an hour's sport
their fishing was successful though never
did two anglers pursue even that silent
and unsocial pleasure with less verbal intercourse

when their time was expired douglas
took the oars in his turn and by his order
roland greene steered the boat directing
her course upon the landingplace at the
castle but he also stopped in the midst 
his course and looking around him said to
graeme there is a thing which i could
mention to thee but it is so deep a secret
that even here surrounded as we are by sea
and sky without the possibility a listener
i cannot prevail on myself to speak it out
 better leave it unspoken sir answered
roland greene if you doubt the honour
 him who alone can hear it
 i doubt not your honour replied
the abbot 
george douglas but you are young imprudent
and changeful
 young said roland i am and it
may be imprudent but who hath informed
you that i am changeful 
 one that knows you perhaps better
than you know yourself replied douglas
i suppose you mean catherine seyton
said the page his heart rising as he spoke j
 but she is herself fifty times more variable
in her humour than the very water which
we are floating upon
 my young acquaintance said douglas
 i pray you to remember that catherine
seyton is a lady blood and birth and
must not be lightly spoken 
mastergeorgeof douglassaidgrame
 as that speech seemed to be made under
the warrant something like a threat i pray
you to observe that i value not the threat
at the estimation a fin one these
dead trouts and moreover i would have
you to know that the champion who undervol
 n
 the abbot
takes the defence every lady blood
and birth whom men accuse change 
faith and fashion is like to have enough
 work on his hands
go to said the seneschal but in a
tone good humour thou art a foolish
boy unfit to deal with any matter more serious
than the casting a net or the flying
 a hawk
 if your secret concern catherine seyton
said the page i care not for it and
so you may tell her if you will i wot she
can shape you opportunity to speak with
her as she has ere now
the flush which passed over douglas's
face made the page aware that he had
lighted on a truth when he was in fact
speaking at random and the feeling that
he had done so was like striking a dagger
into his own heart his companion without
farther answer resumed the oars and
pulled lustily till they arrived at the island
and the castle the servants received the
produce their spoil and the two fishers
the abbot 
turning from each other in silence went
each to his several apartment
roland graeme had spent about an hour
in grumbling against catherine seyton the
queen the regent and the whole house
 lochleven with george douglas at the
head it when the time approached that
his duty called him to attend the meal 
queen mary as he arranged his dress for
this purpose he grudged the trouble which
on similar occasions he used with boyish
foppery to consider as one the most important
duties his day and when he
went to take his place behind the chair 
the queen it was with an air offended
dignity which could not escape her observation
and probably appeared to her ridiculous
enough for she whispered something
in french to her ladies at which the lady
fleming laughed and catherine appeared
half diverted and half disconcerted this
pleasantry which the subject was concealed
from him the unfortunate page 
the abbot
civet course as a new offence and
called an additional degree sullen dignity
into his mien which might have exposed
him to farther raillery but that mary appeared
disposed to make allowance for and
compassionate his feelings
with the peculiar tact and delicacy which
no woman possessed in greater perfection
she began to sooth by degrees the vexed
spirit her magnanimous attendant the
excellence the fish which he had taken
in his expedition the high flavour and
beautiful red colour the trouts which
have long given distinction to the lake led
her first to express her thanks to her attendant
for so agreeable an addition to her table
especially upon i jour che jeune and then
brought on enquiries into the place where
the fish had been taken their size their peculiarities
the times when they were in season
and a comparison between the lochleven
trouts and those which are found in
the lakes and rivers the south scotthe
abbot 
land the ill humour roland giccrae
was never an obstinate character it rolled
away like mist before the sun and he
was easily engaged in a keen and animated
dissertation about lochleven trout and sea
trout and river trout and bull trout and
char which never rise to a lily and par
which some suppose infant salmon and
herrings which frequent the nith and vena
kisses which are only found in the castlewood
 lochmaben and he was hurrying
on with the eager impetuosity and enthusiasm
 a young sportsman when he observed
that the smile with which the queen at
first listened to him died languidly away and
that in spite her efforts to suppress them
tears rose to her eyes he stopped suddenly
short and distressed in his turn asked
if he had had the misfortune unwittingly
to give displeasure to her grace 
no my poor boy replied the queen 
but as you numbered up the lakes and
rivers my kingdom imagination cheated
me as it will do and snatched me
 the abbot
from these dreary walls away to the romantic
streams nithsdale and the royal
towers lochmaben o land which my
fathers have so long ruled the pleasures
which you extend so freely your queen is
now deprived and the poorest beggar who
may wander free from one landward town
to another would scorn to change fates with
mary scotland j
 your highness said the lady fleming
 will do well to withdraw
come with me then fleming said 
the queen i would not burthen hearts
so young as these are with the sight my
sorrows
she accompanied these words with a look
 melancholy compassion towards roland
and catherine who were now left alone together
in the apartment
the page found his situation not a little 
embarrassing for as every reader has expel
pierced who may have chanced to be in such
a situation it is extremely difficult to maintain
the full dignity an offended person
the abbot 
in the presence a beautiful girl whatever
reason we may have for being angry with
her catherine seyton on her part sate
still like a lingering ghost which conscious
 the awe which its presence imposes is
charitably disposed to give the poor confused
mortal whom it visits time to recover
his senses and comply with the grand rule
 damonology by speaking first but as
roland seemed in no hurry to avail himself
 her condescension she carried it a step
farther and herself opened the conversation

 i pray you fair sir if it may be permitted
me to disturb your august reverie
by a question so simple what may have
become your rosary 
it is lost madam lost sometime since
said roland partly embarrassed and partly
indignant
 and may i ask farther sir said catherine
 why you have not replaced it
with another i have half a mind she
said taking from her pocket a string ebon
the abbot
ny beads adorned with gold to bestow
one upon you to keep for my sake just to
remind you former acquaintance
there was a little tremulous accent in
the tone with which these words were delivered
which at once put to flight roland
graeme's resentment and brought him to
catherine's side but she instantly resumed
the bold and firm accent which was more
familiar to her i did not bid you she
said come and sit so close by me for the
acquaintance that i spoke has been stiff
and cold dead and buried for this many a
day
 now heaven forbid i said the page 
it has only slept and now that you desire
it should awake fair catherine believe me
that a pledge your returning favour
 nay nay said catherine withholding
the rosary towards which as he spoke he
extended his hand have changed my
mind on better reflection what should a
heretic do with these holy beads that have
been blessed by the father the church
himself
the abbot 
roland winced grievously for he saw
plainly which way the discourse was now
likely to tend and felt that it must at all
events be embarrassing nay but he
said it was as a token your own regard
that you offered them
 ay fair sir but that regard attended
the faithful subject the loyal and pious catholic
the individual who was so solemnly
devoted at the same time with myself to
the same grand duty which you must now
understand was to serve the church and
the queen to such a person if you ever
heard him was my regard due and not
to him who associates with heretics and is
about to become a renegado
 i should scarce believe fair mistress
said roland indignantly that the vane
 your favour turned only to a catholic
wind considering that it points so plainly
to george douglas who i think is both
kinsman and protestant
think better george douglas said
catherine than to believe and then
n 
 the abbot
checking herself as if she had spoken too
much she went on i assure you fair
mr roland that all who wish you well are
sorry for you
their number is very few i believe
answered roland and their sorrow if
they feel any not deeper than ten minutes
time will cure
 they are more numerous and think
more deeply concerning you than you seem
to be aware answered catherine but
perhaps they think wrong you are the
best judge for yourself and if you prefer
gold and church lands to honour and loyalty
and the faith your fathers why should
you be hampered in conscience more than
others 
may heaven bear witness for me
said roland that if i entertain any difference
 opinion that is if i nourish any
doubts in point religion they have been
adopted on the conviction my own mind
and the suggestion my conscience 
ay ay your conscience your conthe
abbot 
science repeated she with satiric emphasis
y your conscience is the scapegoat i
warrant it an able one it will bear the burthen
 one the bestmanorsof the abbey
 saint mary's kennaquhair lately forfeited
to our noble lord the king by the
abbot and community thereof for the
high crime fidelity to their religious vows
and now to be granted by the high and
mighty traitor and so forth james earl
 murray to the good squire dames
roland graeme for his loyal and faithful
service as underespial and deputyturnkey
for securing the person his lawful
sovereign queen mary
 you misconstrue me cruelly said the
page yes catherine most cruelly god
knows i would protect this poor lady at the
risk my life or with my life but what can
i do what can any one do for her 
 much may be done enough may be
done all may be doneif men will be
but true and honourable as scottish men
were in the days bruce and wallace o
roland from what an enterprize you are now
soo the abbot
withdrawing your heart and hand through
mere fickleness and coldness spirit 
 how can i withdraw said roland
from an enterprize which has never been
communicated to me has the queen or
have you or has any one communicated
with me upon any thing for her service
which i have refused or have you not
all you held me at such distance from
your counsels as if i were the most faithless
spy since the days gallon 
and who said catherine seyton
 would trust the sworn friend and pupil
and companion the heretic preacher
henderson ay a proper tutor you have
chosen instead the excellent ambrosius
who is naw turned out house and
homestead if indeed he is not languishing
in a dungeon for withstanding the tyranny
 morton to whose brother the temporalities
 that noble house god have
been gifted away by the regent
 is it possible said the page j and is
the excellent father ambrose in such distress

the abbot 
he would account the news your
falling away from the faith your fathers
answered catherine a worse mishap than
aught that tyranny can inflict on himself
but why said roland very much
moved should you suppose that that 
that it is with me as you say 
 do you yourself deny it replied catherine
do you not admit that you have drank
the poison which you should have dashed
from your lips do you deny that it now
ferments in your veins if it has not altogether
corrupted the springs life do yau
deny that you have your doubts as you
proudly term them respecting what papes
and councils have declared it unlawful to
doubt is not your faith wavering if not
overthrown does not the heretic preacher
boast his conquest does not the heretic
woman this prisonhouse hold up thy
example to others do not the queen
and the lady fleming believe in thy falling
away and is there any except oneyes
i will speak it out and think as lightly
 the abbot
as you please my good will is there one
except myself that holds even a lingering
hope that you may yet prove what we once
all believed you 
 i know not said our poor page much
embarrassed by the view which was thus presented
to him the conduct he was expected
to pursue and by a person in whom he
was not the less interested that so long
residence in lochleven castle with no object
so likely to attract his undivided attention
had taken place since since they had
first met i know not what you expect
 me or fear from me was sent hitherto
attend queen mary and to her i acknowledge
the duty a servant through
life and death if any one had expected
service another kind i was not the party
to render it i neither avow nor disclaim
the doctrines the reformed church will
you have the truth it seems to me that
the profligacy the catholic clergy has
brought this judgment on their own heads
and for aught i know it may be for their
the abbot 
reformation but for betraying this unhappy
queen god knows i am guiltless 
the thought did i believe worse her
than as her servant i wish as her subject
i dare to do i would not betray her 
far from it i would aid her in aught which
could tend to a fair trial her cause
enough enough answered catherine
clasping her hands together then thou
wilt not desert us if any means are presented
by which placing our royal mistress at
freedom this case may be honestly tried
betwixt her and her rebellious subjects
nay but fair catherine replied the
page hear but what the lord murray
said when he sent me hither
 hear but what the devil said replied
the maiden rather than what a false subject
a false brother a false counsellor a
false friend said a man raised from a petty
pensioner on the crown's bounty to bethe
counsellor majesty and the prime
distributor the bounties the state 
sod the abbor
one with whom rank fortune title consequence
and power all grew up like a mushroom
by the mere warm good will the
sister whom in requital he hath mewed
up in this place melancholy seclusion 
whom in further requital he has deposed
and whom if he dared he would murder
i think not so ill the earl murray
said roland graeme and sooth to
speak he added with a slight smile it
would require some bribe to make me embrace
with firm and desperate resolution
either one side or the other
 nay if that is all replied catherine
seyton in a tone enthusiasm you shall
be guerdon with prayers from oppressed
subjects from dispossessed clergy from
insulted nobles with immortal praise by
future ages with eager gratitude by the
present with fame an earth and with felicity
in heaven your country will thank
you your queen will be debtor to you 
you will achieve at once the highest from
the abbot 
the lowest degree in chivalry all men will
honour all women will love you and i
sworn with you so early to the accomplishment
 queen mary's freedom will yes
i will love you better than ever sister loved
brother
say on say on said poland kneeling
on one knee and taking her hand which
in the warmth her exhortation catherine
held towards him
nay said she pausing i have already
said too much far too much if i
prevail not with you far too little if i do
but i prevail lie continued seeing that
the countenance the youth she addressed
returned the enthusiasm her own i
prevail or rather the good cause prevails
through its own strength thus i devote
thee to it and as she spoke she approached
her finger to the brow the astonished
youth and without touching it signed the
cross over his forehead stooped her face
towards him and seemed to kiss the empty
space in which she had traced the symbol j
 the abbot
then starting up and extricating herself
from his grasp darted into the queen's
apartment
koland graeme remained as the enthusiastic
maiden had left him kneeling on one
knee with breath withheld and with eyes
fixed upon the space which the fairy form
 catherine seyton had so lately occupied
if his thoughts were not unmixed delight
they at least partook that thrilling
and intoxicating though mingled sense
 pain and pleasure the most overpowering
which life offers in its blended cup he
rose and retired slowly and although the
chaplain mr henderson preached on that
evening his best sermon against the errors
 popery i would not engage that he was
followed accurately through the train his
reasoning by the young proselyte with a
view to whose especial benefit he had handled
the subject
the abbot 
chapter x
and when love's torch hath set the heart in flame
comes signor reason with his saws and cautions
giving such aid as the old greybeard sexton
who from the church vault drags his crazy engine
to ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet
against a conflagration
old play
in a musing mood roland graeme upon
the ensuing morning betook himself to the
battlements the castle as a spot where
he might indulge the course his thickcoming
fancies with least chance interruption
but his place retirement was
in the present case ill chosen for he was
presently joined by master elias henderson

 i sought you young man said the
preacher having to speak something
which concerns you nearly
the page had no pretence for avoiding
the conference which the chaplain thus 
 the abbot
feared though he felt that it might prove an
embarrassing one
 in teaching thee as far as my feeble
knowledge hath permitted thy duty towards
god said the chaplain there are
particulars your duty towards man upon
which i was unwilling long or much to insist
you are here in the service a lady
honourable as touching her birth deserving
 all compassion as respects her misfortunes
and garnished with even but too
many those outward qualities which win
men's regard and affection have you ever
considered your regard to this lady mary
 scotland in its true light and bearing 
 i trust reverend sir replied roland
graeme that i am well aware the duties
a servant in my condition owes to his
royal mistress especially in her lowly and
distressed condition
true answered the preacher but it
is even that honest feeling which may in
the lady mary's case carry thee into great
crime and treachery
the abbot 
 how so reverend sir replied the
page i profess i understand you not
i speak to you not the crimes this
illadvised lady said the preacher they
are not subjects for the ears her sworn
servant but it is enough to say that this
unhappy person hath rejected more offers 
grace more hopes glory than ever were
held out to earthly princes and that she is
now her day favour being passed sequestered
in this lonely castle for the commonweal
 the people scotland and it maybe
for the benefit her own soul
 reverend sir said roland somewhat
impatiently i am but too well aware that
my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned since
i have the misfortune to share in her restraint
myself which to speak sooth i
am heartily weary
 it is even that which i am about to
speaksaid the chaplain mildly but first
my good roland look forth on the pleasant
prospect yonder cultivated plain you see
where the smoke arises yonder village 
the abbot
ing half hidden by the trees and you know it
to be the dwellingplace peace and industry
from space to space each by the side 
its own stream you see the gray towers 
barons with cottages interspersed and you
know that they also with their household
are now living in unity the lance hung up on
the wall and the sword resting in its sheath
you see too more than one fair church
where the pure waters life are offered to
the thirsty and where the hungry are refreshed
with spiritual food what would
he deserve who should bring fire and
slaughter into so fair and happy a scene 
who should bare the swords the gentry
and turn them against each other who
should give tower and cottage to the flames
and slake the embers with the blood the
indwellers what would he deserve who
should lift up again that ancient dagon 
superstition whom the worthies the time
have beaten down and who should once
more make the churches god the high
places baal 
the abbot 
 you have limned a frightful picture
reverend sir said roland greene yet i
guess not whom you would charge with the
purpose effecting a change so horrible
 god forbid replied the preacher that
 should say to thee thou art the man 
yet beware roland graeme that thou in
serving thy mistress hold fast the still higher
service which thou west to the peace thy
country and the prosperity her inhabitants
 else roland gramme thou mayest bethe
very man upon whose head will fall the
curses and assured punishment due to such
work ifthou art won by the song these syrens
to aid that unhappy lady's escape from
this place penitence and security it is
over with the peace scotland's cottages
and with the prosperity her palaces and
the babe unborn shall curse the name the
man who gave inlet to the disorder which
will follow the war betwixt the mother and
the son
 i know no such plan reverend sir
 the abbot
answered the page and therefore can aid
none such my dirty towards the queen
has been simply that an attendant it is
a task which at times i would willingly
have been freed nevertheless 
 it is to prepare thee for the enjoyment
 something more liberty said the
preacher that i have endeavoured to impress
upon you the deep responsibility under
which your office must be discharged
george douglas hath told the lady loch
leven that you are weary this service and
my intercession hath partly determined her
good ladyship that as your discharge cannot
be granted you shall instead be employed
in certain commissions on the mainland
which have hitherto been discharged
by other persons confidence wherefore
come with me to the lady for even today
such duty will be imposed on you
 i trust you will hold me excused reverend
sir said the page who felt that an
increase confidence on the part the
the abbot 
lady the castle and her family would
render his situation in a moral view doubly
embarrassing one cannot serve two masters
 and i much fear that my mistress will
not hold me excused for taking employment
under another
 dear not that said the preacher her
consent shall be asked and obtained i fear
she will yield it but too easily as hoping to
avail herself your agency to maintain
correspondence with her friends as those
falsely call themselves who would make
her name the watch word for civil war
 and thus said the page i will be
exposed to suspicion on all sides for my
mistress will consider me as a spy placed on
her by her enemies seeing me so far trusted
by them and the lady lochleven will
never cease to suspect the possibility my
betraying her because circumstances put it
into my power to do so i would rather remain
as i am
there followed a pause one or two
minutes during which henderson looked
vol ir o
 the abbot
steadily in roland's countenance as if desirous
to ascertain whether there was not
more in the answer than the precise words
seemed to imply he failed in this point
however for roland bred a page from
childhood knew how to assume a sullen
petted cast countenance well enough
calculated to hide all internal emotions
 i understand thee not roland said
the preacher or rather thou thickest on
this matter more deeply than i apprehended
to be in thy nature methought the
delight going on shore with thy bow or
thy gun or thy anglingrod would have
borne away all other feelings
 and so it would replied roland who
perceived the danger suffering henderson's
half raised suspicions to become fully
awake i would have thought nothing
but the gun and the oar and the wild waterfowl
that tempt me by sailing among
the sedges yonder so far out flightshot
had you not spoken my going on shore
as what was to occasion burning town
the abbot 
and tower the downfall the evangelic
and the up setting the mass
 follow me then said henderson
 and we will seek the lady lochleven
they found her at breakfast with her
grandson george douglas peace be with
your ladyship said the preacher bowing
to his patroness roland graeme awaits
your order
 young man said the lady our
chaplain hath warranted for thy fidelity
and we are determined to give you certain
errands to do for us in our town kinross
 not by my advice said douglas coldly
 i said not that it was answered the lady
something sharply the mother thy
father may i should think be old enough
to judge for herself in a matter so simple
thou wilt take the skiff roland and two
 my people whom clydesdale or randal
will order out and fetch off certain stuff 
plate and hangings which should last night
be lodged at kinross by the wains from
edinburgh
s the abbot
and give this packet said george
douglas to a servant ours whom you
will find in waiting there it is the report
to my father he added looking towards
the grandmother who acquiesced by bending
her head
i have already mentioned to master
henderson said roland graeme that
as my duty requires my attendance on the
queen her grace's permission for my journey
ought to be obtained before i can undertake
your commission
 look to it my son said the old lady
the scruple the youth is honourable
craving your pardon madam i have
no wish to force myself on her presence
thus early said douglas in an indifferent
tone j it might displease her and were noway
agreeable to me
and i said the lady lochleven although
her temper hath been more gentle
 late have no will to undergo without
necessity the rancour her wit
 under your permission madam said
the abbot 
the chaplain i will myself render your
request to the queen during my long residence
in this house she hath not deigned
to see me in private or to hear my doctrine
 yet so may heaven prosper my labours
as love for her soul and desire to
bring her into the right path was my chief
desire for coming hither
take care master henderson said
douglas in a tone which seemed almost
sarcastic lest you rush hastily on an adventure
to which you have no vocation 
you are learned and know the adage ne
aceesseris in consilium nisi vocat who
hath required this at your hand 
the master to whose service i am called
answered the preacher looking upward
 he vho hath commanded me to
be earnest in season and out season
 your acquaintance hath not been much
i think with courts or princes continued
the young esquire
 no sir replied henderson but
 the abbot
ike my master knox i see nothing frightful
in the fair face a pretty lady
my son said the lady lochleven
 quench not the good man's zeal let him
do the errand to this unhappy princess
 with more willingness than i would
do it myself said george douglas yet
something in his manner appeared to con 
tract his words 
the minister went accordingly and demanding
an audience the imprisoned
princess was admitted he found her with
her ladies engaged in the daily task embroidery
the queen received him with 
that courtesy which in ordinary cases she j
used towards all who approached her and 
the clergyman in opening his commission
was obviously somewhat more embarrassed
than he had expected to be the good
lady lochleven may it please your
grace
he made a short pause during which
mary said with a smile my grace would
the abbot 
in truth be well pleased were the lady
lochleven our good lady but go on 
what is the will the good lady lochleven

 she desires madam said the chaplain
 that your grace will permit this young
gentleman your page roland grme to
pass to kinross to look after some household
stuff and hangings sent hither for the
better furnishing your grace's apartments
the lady lochleven said the
queen uses needless ceremony in requesting
our permission for that which
stands within her own pleasure we well
know that this young gentleman's attendance
on us had not been so long permitted
were he not thought to be more at the command
 that good lady than at ours but
we cheerfully yield consent that he shall goon
her errand with our will we would doom
no living creature to the captivity which
we ourselves must suffer
 ay madam answered the preacher
 and it is doubtless natural for humanity
s the abbot
to quarrel with its prisonhouse yet there
have been those who have found that time
spent in the house temporal captivity
may be so employed as to redeem us from
spiritual slavery
i apprehend your meaning sir replied
the queen but i have heard your
apostle i have heard master john knox 
aim were i to be perverted i would willingly
resign to the ablest and most powerful 
heresiarchs the poor honour he might acquire
by overcoming my faith and my
hope
 madam said the preacher it is not
to the talents or skill the husbandman
that god gives the increase the words
which were offered in vain by him whom
you justly call our apostle during the bustle
and gaiety a court may yet find better
acceptance during e leisure for reflection
which this place affords god knows
lady that i speak in singleness heart
as one who would as soon compare himself
to the immortal angels as to the holy man
the abbot si
whom you have named yet would you
but condescend to apply to their noblest
use those talents and that learning which
all allow you to be possessed would
you afford us but the slightest hope that
you would hear and regard what can be
urged against the blinded superstition and
idolatry in which you are brought up sure
am i that the most powerfully gifted my
brethren that even john knox himself
would hasten hither and account the rescue
 your single soul from the nets romish
error
 i am obliged to you and o them for
their charity said mary bu as i have
at present but one presencechamber i
will reluctantly see it converted into a huguenot
synod
 at least madam be not thus obstinately
blinded in your errors hear one who
has hungered and thirsted watched and
prayed to undertake the good work your
conversion and who would be content to
die the instant that a work so advantageous
 the abbot
for yourself and so beneficial to scotland
were accomplished yes lady could i but
shake the remaining pillar the heathen
temple in this land and that permit me to
term your faith in the delusions rome 
i could be content to die overwhelmed in
the ruins
 i will not insult your zeal sir replied
mary by saying you are more likely to
make sport for the philistines than to overwhelm
them your charity claims my
thanks for it is warmly expressed and maybe
truly purposed but believe as well 
me as i am willing to do you and think
that i may be as anxious to recal you to the
ancient and only road as you are to teach
me your new byeways to paradise
 then madam if such be your generous
purpose said henderson eagerly what
hinders that we should dedicate some part
 that time unhappily now too much at
cour grace's disposal to discuss a question
so weighty you by report all men are
both learned and witty and i though withthe
abbot 
c
out such advantage am strong in my cause
as in a tower defence why should we
not spend some space in endeavouring to
discover which us hath the wrong side
in this most important matter 
nay said queen mary i never alleged
my force was strong enough to accept
 a combat en champ clos with a scholar
and a polemic besides the match is not
equal you sir might retire when you felt
the battle go against you while i am tied
to the stake and have no permission to say
the debate wearies me i would be alone
she curtsied low to him as she uttered
these words and henderson whose zeal
was indeed ardent but did not extend to
the neglect delicacy bowed in return
and prepared to withdraw
 i would he said that my earnest
wish my most zealous prayer could procure
to your grace any blessing or comfort
but especially that in which alone
blessing or comfort is as easily as the slighted
ths abbot
est intimation your wish will remove me
from your presence
he was in the act departing when
mary said to him with much courtesy
do me no injury in your thoughts good
sir j it may be that if my time here be protracted
longer as surely i hope it will not
trusting that either my rebel subjects will repent
 their disloyalty or that my faithful
lieges will obtain the upper hand but if my
time be here protracted it may be i shall
have no displeasure in hearing one who seems
so reasonable and compassionate as yourself
and i may hazard your contempt by endeavouring
to recollect and repeat the reasons
which schoolmen and councils give for the
faith that is in me although i fear that
god help mee my latin has deserted me
with my other possessions this must however
be for another day meanwhile sir let
the lady lochleven employ my page as
she lists i will not afford suspicion by speaking
a word to him before he goes roland
the abbot 
greeme my friend lose not an opportunity
 amusing thyself dance sing run and
leap all may be done merrily on the mainland
 but he must have more than quicksilver
in his vins who could frolic here
 alas madam said the preacher to
what is it you exhort the youth while time
passes and eternity summons can our
salvation be insured by idle mirth or our
good work wrought out without fear and
trembling 
 i cannot fear or tremble replied the
queen to mary stuart such emotions
are unknown but if weeping and sorrow
on my part will atone for the boy enjoying
an hour boyish pleasure be assured the
penance shall be duly paid
nay but gracious lady said the
preacher in this you greatly err our
tears and our sorrows are all too little for
our own fauns and follies nor can we transfer
them as your church falsely teaches to
the benefit others
 may pray you sir answered the
 the abbot
queen with as little offence as such a
prayer may import to transfer yourself elsewhere
we are sick at heart and may not
now be disturbed with farther controversy
and thou roland take this little purse 
then turning to the divine she said shewing
its contents look reverend sir it
contains only these two or three gold festoons
a coin which though bearing my own
poor features i have ever found more active
against me than on my side just as my subjects
take arms against me with my own
name for their summons and signal take
this purse that thou mayest want no means
 amusement fail not fail not to bring
me back news from kinross only let it be
such as without suspicion or offence maybe
told in the presence this reverend
gentleman or the good lady lochleven 
herself
the last hint was too irresistible to be
withstood and henderson withdrew half
mortified half pleased with his reception
for mary from long habit and the address
the abbot 
which was natural to her had learned in an
extraordinary degree the art evading
discourse which was disagreeable to her
feelings or prejudices without affronting
those by whom it was proffered
roland graeme retired with the chaplain
at a signal from his lady but it did not
escape him that as he left the room stepping
backwards and making the deep obeisance
due to royalty catherine seyton held
up her slender forefinger with a gesture
which he alone could witness and which
seemed to say remember what has passed
betwixt us
roland greene had now his last charge
from the lady lochleven there are
revels she said this day at the village 
my son's authority is as yet unable to prevent
these continued workings the ancient
leaven folly which the romish
priests have kneaded into the very souls 
the scottish peasantry t do not command
thee to abstain from them that would be
only to lay a snare for thy folly or to teach
 the abbot
thee falsehood but enjoy these vanities
with moderation and mark them as what
thou must soon learn to renounce and contemn
our chamberlain at kinross luke
lundin doctor as he foolishly calleth
himself will acquaint thee what is to be
done in the matter about which thou goes
remember thou art trusted shew thyself
therefore worthy trust
when we recollect that roland graeme
was not yet nineteen and that he had spent
his whole life in the solitary castle avenel
excepting the few hours he had passed in
edinburgh and his late residence at lochleven
the latter period having very little
served to enlarge his acquaintance with the
gay world we cannot wonder that his heart
beat high with hope and curiosity at the
hope partaking the sport even a country
wake he hastened to his little cabin
and turned over the wardrobe with which
in every respect becoming his station
he had been supplied from edinburgh
probably by order the earl murray
the abbot 
by the queen's command he had hitherto
waited upon her in mourning or at least in
sadcoloured raiment her condition she
said admitted nothing more gay but
now he selected the gayest dress his wardrobe
afforded composed scarlet slashed
with black satin the royal colours 
scotland combed his long curled hairdisposed
his chain and medal round a beaver
hat the newest block and with the
gay falchion which had reached him in so
mysterious a manner hung by his side in
an embroidered belt his apparel added to
his natural frank mien and handsome form
made a most commendable and pleasing
specimen the young gallant the period
he sought to make his parting reverence to
the queen and her ladies but old clydesdale
hurried him to the boat
 we will have no private audiences he
said my master since you are to be trusted
with somewhat we will try at least to
save thee from the temptation opportunity
god help thee child he added with
 the abbor
a glance contempt at his gay clothes
 an the bearward be yonder from saint
andrews have a care thou go not near
him
 and wherefore i pray you said roland

lest he take thee for one his runaway
jack anapes answered the steward
smiling sourly
i wear not my clothes at thy cost said
roland indignantly
nor at thine own either my son replied
the steward else would thy garb
better resemble thy merit
roland graeme suppressed with difficulty
the repartee which arose to his lips and
wrapping his scarlet mantle around him
threw himself into the boat which two
rowers themselves urged by curiosity to
see the revels pulled stoutly towards the
west the lake as they put off roland
thought he could discover the face 
catherine seyton though carefully withdrawn
from observation peeping from a
the abbot 
loophole to view his departure he pulled
off his hat and held it up as a token that
he saw and wished her adieu a white kerchief
waved for a second across the window
and for the rest the little voyage the
thoughts catherine seyton disputed
ground in his breast with the expectations
excited by the approaching revel as they
approached nigher and nigher to the shore
the sounds mirth and music the laugh
the halloo and the shout came thicker upon
the ear and in a trice the boat was moored
and roland graeme hastened in quest 
the chamberlain that being informed what
time he had to his own disposal he might
lay it out to the best advantage
s the abbor

no long space intervened ere roland
graeme was able to discover among the
crowd revellers who gambollel upon the
open space which extends betwixt the village
and the lake a person so great importance
as doctor luke lundin upon
whom devolved officially the charge representing
the lord the land and who
was attended for support his authority
by a piper a drummer and four sturdy
clowns armed with rusty halberds garnished
with partycoloured ribbands myrmidons
who early as the day was had althe
abbot 
ready broken more than one head in the
awful names the laird lochleven and
his chamberlain
as soon as this dignitary was informed
that the castle skiff had arrived with a gallant
dressed like a lord's son at the least
who desired presently to speak with him
he adjusted his ruff and his black coat
turned round his girdle till the garnished
hilt his long rapier became visible and
walked with due solemnity towards the
beach solemn indeed he was entitled to
be even on less important occasions for he
had been bred to the venerable study medicine
as those acquainted with the science
very soon discovered from the aphorisms
which ornamented his discourse his success
had not been equal to his pretensions 
but as he was a native the neighbouring
kingdom fife and bore distant relation
to or dependance upon the ancient
family lundin that ilk who were
bound in close friendship with the house
 lochleven he had through their inter
the abbot
rest got planted comfortably enough in his
present station upon the banks that beautiful
lake the profits his chamberlain
being moderate especially in these unsettled
times he had eked it out a little with some
practice in his original profession and it
was said that the inhabitants the village
and barony kinross were not more effectually
whirled which may be translated
enthralled to the baron's mill than they
were to the medical monopoly the chamberlain
woe betide the family the rich
boor who presumed to depart this life without
a passport from doctor luke lundin 
for if his representatives had aught to settle
with the baron as it seldom happened otherwise
they were sure to find a cold friend
in the chamberlain he was considerate
enough however gratuitously to help the
poor out their ailments and sometimes
out all their other distresses at the same
time
formal in a double proportion both asa
physician and as a person in office and
the abbot sb
proud the scraps learning which rendered
his language almost universally unintelligible
doctor luke lundin approached
the beach and hailed the page as he advanced
towards him the freshness the
morning upon you fair sir you are sent
i warrant me to see if we observe here the
regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed
for eschewing all superstitious ceremonies
and idle abilities in these our
revels i am aware that her good ladyship
would willingly have altogether abolished
and abrogated them but as i had
the honour to quote to her from the works
 the learned hercules saxony finis
curate est vel canonical velcoactuy that is fair
sir for silk and velvet have seldom their
latin ad imguem every cure must be
wrought either by art and induction rule
or by constraint and the wise physician
chuse the former which argument her
ladyship being pleased to allow well i
have made it my business so to blend 
the abbot
destruction and caution with delight fiat
mixtioi as we say that i can answer that the
vulgar mind will be defeated and purged
 anile and popish fooleries by the medicament
exhibited so that the privue vice
being cleansed master henderson or any
other able pastor may at will throw in tonics
and effectuate a perfect moral cure
tutti citojucundo
i have no charge doctor lundin
replied the page
call me not doctor said the chamberlain
 since i have laid aside my furred
gown and bonnet and retired me into this
temporality chamberlainship
o sire said the page who was no
stranger by report to the character this
original the cowl makes not the monk
neither the cord the friar we have all heard

retired gentleman in a short cloak and
doublet marry heaven sent its blessing
and this i must say better fashioned medicines
have brought fewer patients through
longa rohha cora scientia saith the italian
 ha fair sir you have the language 
roland greeme did not think it necessary
to expound to this learned theban
whether he understood him or no but
leaving that matter uncertain he told him
he came in quest certain packages which
should have arrived at kinross and been
placed under the chamberlain's charge the
evening before
 body o me said doctor lundin i
fear our common carrier john auchter
muchty hath met with some mischance
that he came not up last night with his
pains bad land this to journey in my
master and the fool will travel by night too
although besides all maladies from your
tussis to your destiny which walk abroad in
the night air he may well fall in with half

s the abbot
a dozen swashbucklers who will ease him
at once his baggage and his earthly complaints
i must send forth to enquire after
him since he hath stuff the honourable
household on hand and by our lady he
hath stuff mine too certain drugs sent
me from the city for composition my

caused him to tarry on the road take the

and get on your jacks platesleeves and

some terror if you meet with opposers
he then added turning to roland graeme
 i warrant me we shall have news the
the abbot 
pains in brief season meantime it will
please you to look upon the sports but first
to enter my poor lodging and take your
morning's cup for what saith the school
 salerno 
speculum mane haustura
restaurant naturam exhausted
 your learning is too profound for me
replied the page and so would your
draught be likewise i fear
not a whit fair sir a cordial cup 
sack impregnated with wormwood is the
best anti pestilential draught j and to speak
truth the pestilential miasmata are now
very rife in the atmosphere we live in a
happy time young man continued he ina
tone grave irony and have many
blessings unknown to our fathers here
are two sovereigns in the land a regnant
and a claimant that is enough one good
thing but if any one wants more he may
find a king in every peelhouse in the country
 so if we lack government it is not for
want governors then have we a civil
 the abbot
war to refresh us every year and to prevent
our population from starving for want 
food and for the same purpose we have
the plague proposing us a visit the best 
all recipes for thinning a land and converting
younger brothers into elder ones well
each man in his vocation you young fellows
 the sword desire to wrestle fence
or so forth with some expert adversary 
and for my part i love to match myself for
life or death against that same plague
as they proceeded up the street the
little village towards the doctor's lodgings
his attention was successively occupied by
the various personages whom he met and
pointed out to the notice his companion
do you see that fellow with the red
bonnet the blue jerkin and the great rough
barton in his hand i believe that clown
hath the strength a tower he has lived
fifty years in the world and never encouraged
the liberal sciences by buying one
pennyworth medicaments but see you
that man with the fades hippocrates v said
the abbot 
he pointing out a thin peasant with swelled
legs and a most cadaverous countenance 
that i call one the worthiest men in
the barony he breakfasts luncheons dines
and sups by my advice and not without my
medicine and for his own single part will
go farther to clear out a moderate stock 
pharmaceutical than half the country besides
 how do you my honest friend 
said he to the party in question with a tone
 condolence
 very weakly sir since i took the electuary
answered the patient it neighboured
ill with the two spoonfuls peaseporridge
and the kernmilk
peaseporridge and kernmilk have you
been under medicine these ten years and
keep your diet so ill the next morning
take the electuary by itself and touch nothing
for six hours the poor object bowed
and shuffled off
the next whom the doctor deigned to
take notice j was a lame fellow by whom
the honour was altogether undeserved for
p 
 the abbot
at sight the medicine he began to shuffle
away in the crowd as fast as his infirmities
would permit
 there is an ungrateful hound for you
said doctor lundin j i cured him the
gout in his feet and now he talks the
agreeableness medicine and makes the
first use his restored legs to fly from his
physician hisjodagra hath become a cki
agra as honest martial hath it the gout
has got into his fingers and he cannot draw
his purse old saying and true
anaemia cum poscit medicis satan est
we are angels when we come to cure devils
when we ask payment but i will administer
a purgation to his purse i warrant
him there is his brother too a sordid
chuff so ho there saunders varlet you
have been ill i hear 
just got the turn as i was thinking to
send to your honour and i am brawly now
again it was nae great thing that ailed
me
the abbot 
hark you sirrah said the doctor i
trust you remember you are owing to the
laird four stones barley meal and a bow
 oats j and i would have you send no more
such kainfowls as you sent last season that
looked as wretchedly as patients just dismissed
from a plaguehospital and there
is hard money owing besides
 i was thinking sir said the man more
scoticoy that is returning no direct answer
on the subject on which he was addressed
my best way would be to come down to
your honour and take your advice yet incase
my trouble should come back
 do so then knave replied lundin
 and remember what ecclesiasticus saith
give place to the physician let him not
go from thee for thou hast need him
his exhortation was interrupted by an
apparition which seemed to strike the doctor
with as much horror and surprise as his
own visage inflicted upon sundry those
persons whom he had addressed
the figure which produced this effect on
 the abbot
the aesculapius the village was that a
tall old woman who wore a highcrowned
hat and muffler the first these habiliments
added apparently to her stature
and the other served to conceal the lower
part her face and as the hat itself was
slouched little could be seen besides two
brown cheekbones and the eyes swarthy
fire that gleamed from under two shaggy
grey eye brows she was dressed in a long
darkcoloured robe unusual fashion bordered
at the skirts and on the stomacher
with a sort white trimming resembling
the jewish phylacteries on which were
wrought the characters some unknown
language she held in her hand a walking
staff black ebony
by the soul celsus said doctor
luke lundin it is old mother nineveh
herself she hath come to beard me within
mine own bounds and in the very execution
 mine office have at thy coat
old woman as the song says hob anster
let her presently be seized and comthe
abbot 
mitted to the tolbooth and if there are any
zealous brethren here who would give the
hag her deserts and duck her as a witch
in the loch i pray let them in no way be
hindered
but the myrmidons doctor lundin
shewed in this case no alacrity to do his
bidding hob anster even ventured to remonstrate
in the name himself and his
brethren to be sure he was to do his
honour's bidding and for a that folks said
about the skill and the witcheries mother
nicneven he would put his trust in
god and his hand on her collar without
dreadful but she was no common spae
wife this mother nicneven like jean joppa
that lived in the briersbaulk she had
lords and lairds that would ruffle for her
there was moncrief tippermalloch that
was popish and the laird carslogie a
kennedy queen's man were in the fair with
wha kennedy how mony swords and bucklers
at their back and they would be sure to
make a breakout if the officers meddled with
s the abbot
the auld popish witch wife who was sewell
friend mair especially as the laird's best
men such as were not in the cattle were
in edinburgh with him and he doubted his
honour the doctor would find over few to
make a good backing if blades were bare
the doctor listened unwillingly to this
prudential counsel and was only comforted
by the faithful promise his satellite that
the old woman should as he expressed
it be ta'en canny the next time she trespassed
on the bounds
 and in that event said the doctor to
his companion fire and faggot shall bethe
best her welcome
this he spoke in hearing the dame
herself who even then and in passing the
doctor shot towards him from under her
grey eyebrows a look the most insulting
and contemptuous superiority
this way continued the physician
this way marshalling his guest into his
lodging take care you stumble not over
the abbot 
a retort for it is hazardous for the ignorant
to walk in the ways art
the page found all reason for the caution
 for besides stuffed birds and lizards
and snakes bottled up and bundles simples
made up and other parcels spread out
to dry and all the confusion not to mention
the confused and sickening smells incidental
to a druggist's stock in trade he
had also to avoid heaps charcoal crucibles
boltheads stoves and the other furniture
 a chemical laboratory
amongst his other philosophical qualities
doctor lundin failed not to be a confused
sloven and his old dame housekeeper whose
life as she said was spent in redding
him up had trotted off to the mart 
gaiety with other and younger folks much
clattering and jangling therefore there was
among jars and bottles and vials ere the
doctor produced the salutiferous potion
which he recommended so strongly and
a search equally long and noisy follows
the abbot
ed among broken cans and cracked pipkin
ere he could bring forth a cup out 
which to drink it both matters being at
length achieved the doctor set the example
to his guest by quaffing off a cup the
cordial and smacking his lips with approbation
as it descended his gullet roland
in turn submitted to swallow the potion
which his host so earnestly recommended
but which he found so insufferably bitter
that he became eager to escape from the
laboratory in search a draught fair
water to expel the taste in spite his
efforts he was nevertheless detained by the
garrulity his host till he gave him some
account mother nicneven
 i care not to speak her said the
doctor in the open air and among the
throng people not for fright like yon
cowardly dog anster but because i would
give no occasion for a fray having no leisure
to look to stabs slashes and broken bones
men call the old hag a prophetess i do
scarce believe she could foretell when a
the abbot 
brood chickens will chip the shell men
say she reads the heavens my black bitch
knows as much them when she sits baying
the moon men pretend the old wretch
is a sorceress a witch and what not liter
nos i will never contradict a rumour which
may bring her to the stake which she so
richly deserves but neither will i believe
that the tales witches which they din into
our ears are aught but knavery cozenage
and old womens fables
in the name heaven what is she
then said the page that you make such
a stir about her 
 she is one those cursed old women
replied the physician who take currently
and impudently upon themselves to act as
advisers and curers the sick on the
strength some trash herbs some
rhyme spells some julep or diet drink
or cordial
 nay go no farther said the page if
they brew cordials evil be their lot and
all their partakers

you say well young man said doctor
lundin for mine own part i know no
such pests to the commonwealth as these
old incarnate devils who haunt the chambers
 the brainsick patients that are mad
enough to suffer them to interfere with
disturb and let the regular progress a
learned and artificial cure with their syrups
and their juleps and discords and mithridate
and my lady whatshallcall'ums
powder and worthy dame trachea's pill 
and thus make widows and orphans and
cheat the regular and well studied physician
in order to get the name wise women
and steely neighbours and so forth
but no more on't mother nicneven and
i will meet one day and she shall know
there is danger in dealing with the doctor
it is a true word and many have found
it said the page but under your favour
i would fain walk abroad for a little and
see these sports
 it is well moved said the doctor
 and i too should be showing myself

at his shaggy coat under the mediation
 the bear ward and half a dozen butchers
and yeomen who by dint staving entailing

the itinerant minstrel found himself

playground the remainder being left open
for the entrance and exit the performers
here sate the uncritical audienccjthe chamberlain
in the centre as the person highest
in office all alive to enjoyment and admiration
and all therefore dead to criticism
the characters which appeared and disappeared
before the amused and interested
audience were those which fill the earlier
stage in all nations old men cheated by
their wives and daughters pillaged by their
sons and imposed on by their domestics a
braggadocio captain a knavish pardoner
or questioner a country bumpkin and a
wanton city dame amid all these and
more acceptable than almost the whole put
together was the alllicensed fool the gracious
 the spanish drama who with his
the abbot 
cap fashioned into the resemblance a
coxcomb and his bauble a truncheon terminated
by a carved figure wearing a fool'scap
in his hand went came and returned
mingling in every scene the piece and
interrupting the business without having
any share himself in the action and ever
and anon transferring his gibes from the
actors on the stage to the audience who
sate around prompt to applaud the whole
the wit the piece which was not 
the most polished kind was chiefly directed
against the superstitious practices the
catholic religion j and the stage artillery
had on this occasion been levelled by no
less a person than doctor lundin who
had not only commanded the manager 
the entertainment to select one the numerous
satires which had been written
against the papists several which were
cast in a dramatic form but had even like
the prince denmark caused them to insert
or according to his own phrase to infuse
here and there a few pleasantries 
 the abbot
his own penning on the same inexhaustible
subject hoping thereby to mollify the
rigour the lady lochleven towards
pastimes this description he failed not
to jog roland's elbow who was sitting instate
behind him and recommend to his
particular attention those favourite passages
as for the page to whom the very
idea such an exhibition simple as it
was was entirely new he beheld it with
the undiminished and ecstatic delight with
which men all ranks look for the first
time on dramatic representation and laughed
shouted and clapped his hands as the
performance proceeded an incident at
length took place which effectually broke
off his interest in the business the scene
one the principal personages in the
comic part the drama was as we have
already said a qusestionaryor pardoner one
 those itinerants who hawked about from
place to place reliques real or pretended
with which he excited the devotion at once
and the charity the populace and generalthe
abbot 
y deceived both the one and the other the
hypocrisy impudence and profligacy 
these clerical wanderers had made them the
subject satire from the time chaucer
down to that heywood their present
representative failed not to follow the same
line humour exhibiting pig's bones lor
reliques and boasting the virtues small
tin crosses which had been shaken in the
holy porringer at lorenzo and cockleshells
which had been brought from the
shrine saint james composedly all
which he disposed to the devout catholics
at nearly as high a price as antiquaries
are now willing to pay for baubles similar
intrinsic value at length the pardoner
pulled from his scrip a small phial clear
vater which he vaunted the quality in
the following verses 
listneth gode people everiche one
for in the lone babylon
far eastward wot it lyethj
and is the first lone the sonne espieth
ther as he cometh fro out the se 
in this ilk lone as thinker me
a 
 the abbot
right as hole legends tell
snottreth from a rose a well
and falleth into ane bath son
wher cast susanne in times long gon
was wont to wash her bodie and lira
mickle vertue hath that serene
as ye shall se er that ye pas
ensample by this little glas 
through nights cold and dayes hope
afterward i have it brought 
hath a wife made slip or slide
or a maiden stepp'd aside 
putteth this water under her nose
wold she nbld she she shall snese
the jest as the reader skilful in the antique
language the drama must at once
perceive turned on the same pivot as in the
old minstrel tales the drinking horn 
king arthur and the mantle made amiss
but the audience were neither learned nor
critical enough to challenge its want originality
the potent relique was after
such grimace and buffoonery as befitted the
subject presented successively to each 
the female personages the drama not
one whom sustained the supposed test
 discretion but to the infinite delight 
the abbot 
the audience sneezed much louder and
longer than perhaps they themselves had
counted on the jest seemed at last worn
threadbare and the pardoner was passing
on to some new pleasantry when the jester
or clown the drama possessing himself
secretly the phial which contained the
wondrous liquor applied it suddenly to the
nose a young woman who with her
black silk muffler or screen drawn over her
face was sitting in the foremost rank the
spectators intent apparently upon the business
 the stage the contents the
phial well calculated to sustain the credit
 the pardoner's legend set the damsel a
sneezing violently an admission frailty
which was received with shouts rapture
by the audience these were soon however
renewed at the expence the jester
himself when the insulted maiden extricated
ere the paroxysm was well over one
hand from the folds her mantle and bestowed
on the wag a buffet which made him
reel fully his own length from the pardoner
 the abbot
and then acknowledge the favour by instant
prostration
no one pities a jester overcome in his
vocation and the clown met with little sympathy
when rising from the ground and
whimpering forth his complaints harsh
treatment he invoked the assistance and
sympathy the audience but the chamberlain
feeling his own dignity insulted ordered
two his halberdiers to bring the
culprit before him when these official persons
first approached the virago she threw
herself into an attitude firm defiance as
if determined to resist their authority j and
from the sample strength and spirit which
she had already displayed they shewed no
alacrity at executing their commission but
on half a minute's reflection the damsel
changed totally her attitude and manner
folded her cloak around her arms in modest
and maidenlike fashion and walked her
own accord to the presence the great
man followed and guarded by the two manful
satellites as she moved across the vathe
abbot 
cant space and more especially as she stood
at the footstool the doctor's judgmentseat
the maiden discovered that lightness
and elasticity step and natural grace 
manner which connoisseurs in female beauty
know to be seldom divided from it
moreover her neat russetcoloured jacket
and short petticoat the same colour displayed
a handsome form and a pretty leg
her features were concealed by the screen j
but the doctor whose gravity did not prevent
his pretensions to be a connoisseur 
the school we have hinted at saw enough
to judge favourably the piece by the
sample
he began however with considerable
austerity manner and how nosy
saucy quean said the medical man office
 what have you to say why i shout
not order you to be ducked in the loch for
lifting your hand to the man in my presence

 marry replied the culprit because
 the abbot
i judge that your honour will not think the
cold bath necessary for my complaints
a pestilent jade said the doctor whispering
to roland grme and i'll warrant
her a good one her voice is as sweet as
syrup but my pretty maiden said he
you shew us wonderfully little that
countenance yours be pleased to throw
aside your muffler
 i trust your honour will excuse me till
we are more private answered the maiden 
for i have acquaintance and i should hke
ill to be known in the country as the poor
girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest
upon
fear nothing for thy good name my
sweet little modicum candied manna
replied the doctor for i protest to you
as i am chamberlain lochleven kinross
and so forth that the chaste susanna
herself could not have snuffed that elixir
without sternutation being in truth a curious
distillation rectified acefum or vinegar
 the sun prepared by mine own hands
the abbot 
wherefore as thou mayest thou wilt come
to me in private and express thy contrition
for the offence whereof thou hast been guilty
i command that all for the present go
forward as if no such interruption the
prescribed course had taken place
the damsel curtsied and tripped back to
her place the play proceeded but it no
longer attracted the attention roland
gramme
the voice the figure and what the veil
permitted to be seen the neck and tresses
 the village damsel bore so strong a resemblance
to those catherine seton
that he felt like one bewildered in the mazes
 a changeful and studying dream the
memorable scene the hostelry rushed on
his recollection with all its doubtful and
marvellous circumstances were the tales
 enchantment which he had read in romances
realized in this extraordinary girl 
could she transport herself from the walled
and guarded castle lochleven moaned
with its broad lake towards which he cast
 the abbot
back a look as if to ascertain it was still inexistence
and watched with such scrupulous
care as the safety a nation demanded
 could she surmount all these obstacles
and make such careless and dangerous use
 her liberty as to engage herself publicly
in a quarrel in a village fair roland was
unable to determine whether the exertions
which it must have cost her to gain her
freedom or the use to which she had put
it rendered her the most unaccountable
creature
lost in these meditations he kept his
gaze fixed on the subject them and in
every casual motion discovered or thought
he discovered something which reminded
him still more strongly catherine seton
it occurred to him more than once indeed
that he might be deceiving himself by exaggerating
some casual likeness into absolute
identity but then the meeting at the
hostelry saint michael's returned to his
mind and it seemed in the highest degree
improbable that under such various cir
the abbot 
substances mere imagination should twice
have found opportunity to play him the selfsame
trick this time however he determined
to have his doubts resolved and for
this purpose he sate during the rest the
play like a greyhound in the slip ready
to spring upon the hare the instant that she
was started the damsel whom he watched
attentively lest she should escape in
the crowd when the spectacle was closed
sate as if perfectly unconscious that she was
observed but the worthy doctor marked
the direction his eyes and magnanimously
suppressed his own inclination to become
the theseus to this hippolyta in deference to
the rights hospitality which enjoined him
to forbear interference with the pleasurable
pursuits his young friend he passed one
or two formal gibes upon the fixed attention
which the page paid to the unknown and
upon his own jealousy adding however that
if both were to be presented to the patient
at once he had little doubt she would think
the younger man the sounder prescription
 the abbot
i fear me he added we shall have no
news the knave auchtermuchty for sometime
since the vermin whom i sent after
him seem to have proved corbiemessengers
so you have an hour or two on your
hands master page and as the minstrels
are beginning to strike up now that the
play is ended why an you incline for a
dance yonder is the green and there sits
your partner i trust you will hold me perfect
in ray diagnostics since i see with half
an eye what disease you are sick and
have administered a pleasing remedy
discern sapiens res as chambers hath it quae con
pundit apelles
the page hardly heard the the
learned adage or the charge which the
chamberlain gave him to be within reach
in case the pains arriving suddenly and
sooner than expected so eager he was at
once to shake himself free his learned associate
and to satisfy his curiosity regarding
the unknown damsel yet in the haste
the abbot 
with which he made towards her he found
time to reflect that in order to secure an
opportunity conversing with her in private
he must not alarm her at first accosting
her he therefore composed his manner
and gait and advancing with becoming selfconfidence
before three or four countryfellows
who were intent on the same design
but knew not so well how to put their request
into shape he acquainted her that he
as the deputy the venerable chamberlain
requested the honour her hand as a partner

the venerable chamberlain said the
damsel frankly reaching the page her hand
 does very well to exercise this part his
privilege by deputy and i suppose the laws
 the revels leave me no choice but to accept
 his faithful delegate
 providing fair damsel said the page
his choice a delegate is not altogether
distasteful to you
 that fair sir replied the maiden
 the abbot
 i will tell you more when we have danced
the first measure
we have mentioned that catherine seyton
had admirable skill in gestic lore and
that she was sometimes called on to dance
for the amusement her royal mistress roland
graeme had often been a spectator 
her sml and sometimes at the queen's command
catherine's partner on such occasions
he was therefore perfectly acquainted with
catherine's mode dancing and observed
that his present partner in grace in agility
in quickness ear and precision execution
exactly resembled her save that the
scottish jigg which he now danced with
her required a more violent and rapid motion
and more rustic agility than the stately
parens lavoltas and counties which
he had seen her execute in the chamber 
queen mary the active duties the
dance left him little time for reflection and
none for conversation but when their jades
deux was finished amidst the acclama
the abbot 
tions the villagers who had seldom witnessed
such an exhibition he took an opportunity
when they yielded up the green to
another couple to use the privilege a
partner and enter into conversation with
the mysterious maiden whom he still held
by the hand fair partner may i not
crave the name her who has graced me
thus far 
you may said the maiden but it
is a question whether shall answer you
 and why asked roland
 because nobody gives anything for nothing
 and you can tell me nothing in return
which i care to hear
 could i not tell you my name and lineage
in exchange for yours returned
roland
 no answered the maiden for you
know little either
 how said the page somewhat angrily

wrath you not for the matter said
the damsel i will shew you in an instant
 the abbot
that i know more you than you do 
yourself
 indeed answered graeme for whom
then do you take me 
 for the wild falcon answered she
whom a dog brought in his mouth to a
certain castle when he was but an unfledged
eyass for the hawk whom men dare
not let fly lest he should check at game
and pounce on carrion whom folks must
keep hooded till he has the proper light 
his eyes and can discover good from evil
well be it so replied roland graeme
i guess at a part your parable fair mistress
mine and perhaps i know as much
 you as you do me and can well dispense
with the information which you are
so niggard in giving
 prove that said the maiden and i
will give you credit for more penetration
than i judged you to be gifted withal
 it shall be proved instantly said roland
graeme the first letter your
name is s and the last n
the abbot 
admirable said his partner guess
on
it pleases you today continued roland
 to wear the snood and kirtle and
perhaps you may be seen tomorrow in hat
and feather hose and doublet
in the clout in the clout you have
hit the very white said the damsel suppressing
a great inclination to laugh
you can switch men's eyes out their
heads as well as the heart out their bosoms

these last words were uttered in a low
and tender tone which to roland's great
mortification and somewhat to his displeasure
was so far from allaying that it greatly
increased his partner's disposition to
laughter she could scarce compose herself
while she replied if you had thought
my hand so formidable extricating it from
his grasp you would not have grasped it
so hard but i perceive you know me so
fully that there is no occasion to shew you
mv face
 the abbot
 fair catherine said the page he
were unworthy ever to have seen you far
less to have dwelt so long in the same service
and under the same roof with you who
could mistake your air your gesture your
step in walking or in dancing the turn 
your neck the symmetry your form
none could be so dull as not to recognize
you by so many proofs but for me i could
swear even to that tress hair that escapes
from under your muffler
and to the face course which that
muffler covers said the maiden removing
her veil and in an instant endeavouring to
replace it she shewed the features catherine
 but an unusual degree petulant
impatience inflamed them when from some
awkwardness in her management the
muffler she was unable again to adjust it
with that dexterity which was a principal
accomplishment the coquettes the
time
 the fiend rive the rag to tatters said
the damsel as the veil fluttered about her
the abbott s
shoulders with an accent so earnest and
decided that it made the page start he
looked again at the damsel's face but the
information which his eyes received was to
the same purport as before he assisted
her to adjust her muffler and both were for
for an instant silent the damsel spoke
first for roland greene was overwhelmed
with surprise at the contrarieties which catherine
seyton seemed to include in her
person and character
 you are surprised said the damsel to
him at what you see and hear but the
times which make females men are least 
all fitted for men to become women yet you
yourself are in danger such a change
 i in danger becoming effeminate 
said the page
yes you for all the boldness your
reply said the damsel when you should
hold fast your religion because it is assailed
on all sides by rebels traitors and heretics
you let it glide out your breast like wavol
iii b
 the abbot

ter grasped in the hand if you are driven
from the faith your fathers from fear 
a traitor is not that womanish if you
are cajoled by the cunning arguments a
trumpeter heresy or the praises a puritanic
old woman is not that womanish 
if you are bribed by the hope spoil
and preferment is not that womanish 
and when you wonder at my venting a
threat or an execration should you not
wonder at yourself who pretending to a
gentle name and aspiring to knighthood
can be at the same time cowardly silly
and selfinterested 
i would that a man would bring such
a charge said the page he should see
ere his life was a minute older whether he
had cause to term me coward or no
 beware such big words answered
the maiden you said but anon that i
sometimes wear hose and doublet
 but remain still catherine seyton
wear what you list said the page endear
abbot 
pouring again to possess himself her
hand
 you indeed are pleased to call me
so replied the maiden evading his intention
 but i have many another name besides

 and will you not reply to that said
the page by which you are distinguished
beyond every other maiden in scotland

the damsel unaltered by his praises still
kept aloof and sung with gaiety a verse from
an old ballad
o some do call me jack sweet love
and some do call me gill 
but when i ride to holyrood
my name is wilful will
 wilful will exclaimed the page
impatiently say rather will o the wisp
jack with the lantern for never was such
a deceitful or wandering meteor
 if i be such replied the maiden i
 the abbot
ask no fools to follow me if they do so it
is at their own pleasure and must be on
their own proper peril
 nay but dearest catherine said
roland graeme be for one instant serious

 if you will call me your dearest catherine
when i have given you so many
names to chuse upon replied the damsel
 i would ask you how supposing me
for two or three hours my life escaped
from yonder tower you have the cruelty
to ask me to be serious during the only
merry moments i have seen perhaps for
months 
ay but fair catherine there are moments
 deep and true feeling which are
worth ten thousand years the liveliest
mirth and such was that yesterday when
you so nearly
 so nearly what demanded the darnsel
hastily
 when you approached your hips so
the abbot 
near to the sign you had traced on my forehead

mother heaven said she in a yet
fiercer tone and with a more masculine
manner than she had yet exhibited catherine
seyton approach her lips to a man's
brow and thou that man vassal thou
lies r
the page stood astonished but conceiving
he had alarmed the damsel's delicacy
by alluding to the enthusiasm a moment
and the manner in which she had expressed
it he endeavoured to faulter forth an
apology his excuses though he was unable
to give them any regular shape were
accepted by his companion who had indeed
suppressed her indignation after its first explosion
 speak no more on't she said 
and now let us part our conversation may
attract more notice than is convenient for
either us
 nay but allow me at least to follow
you to some sequestered place
so the abbot
 you dare not replied the maiden
how said the youth dare not 
where is it you dare go where i dare not
follow r
you fear a will o the wisp said the
damsel how would you face a fiery dragon
with an enchantress mounted on its
back 
like sir ever sir grime or sir greysteel
said the page but be there such
toys to be seen here 
 go to mother nicneven's answered
the maid and she is witch enough to
rein the horned devil with a red silk thread
for a bridle and a rowantree switch for a
whip
 i will follow you said the page
let it be at some distance said the
maiden
and wrapping her mantle around her
with more success than on her former attempt
she mingled with the throng and
walked towards the village heed fully folthe
abbot 
lowed by roland gramme at some distance
and under every precaution which he could
use to prevent his purpose from being observed

s the abbot
chapter 
yes it is he whose eyes look'd on thy childhood
and watch d with trerabhng hope thy dawn youth
that now with these same eyeballs dirnm'd with age
and dimnict yct with tears sees thy dishonour
old play
at the entrance the principal or indeed
so to speak the only street in kinross
the damsel whose steps were pursued by
roland graeme cast a glance behind her
as if to be certain he had not lost trace 
her and then plunged down a very narrow
lane which run betwixt two rows poor
and ruinous cottages she paused for a second
at the door one those miserable
tenements again cast her eye up the lane
towards roland then lifted the latch opened
the door and disappeared from his view
with whatever haste the page followed
the abbot s

her example the difficulty which he found
in discovering the trick the latch which
did not work quite in the usual manner
and in pushing open the door which did
not yield to his first effort delayed for a
minute or two his entrance into the cottage
a dark and smoky passage passed as
usual betwixt the exterior wall the house
and the hullan or claywall which served asa
partition betwixt and the interior at the
 this passage and through the partition
was a door leading into the hen or
inner chamber the cottage and when
roland gramme's hand was upon the latch
 this door a female voice pronounced
benedictus qui venial in nomine domini 
damascus qui in wmiie inimici on entering
the apartment he perceived the figure
which the chamberlain had pointed out to
him as mother nicneven seated beside the
lowly hearth but there was no other person
in the room roland graeme gazed
around in surprise at the disappearance 
catherine seyton without paying much reb

 the abbot
gard to the supposed sorceress until she
attracted and rivetted his regard by the
tone in which she asked him what seekest
thou here 
 i seek said the page with much embarrassment
 i seek 
but his answer was cut short when the
old woman drawing her huge grey eyebrows
sternly together with a frown which
knitted her brow into a thousand wrinkles
arose and stretching herself up to her full
natural size tore the kerchief from her
head and seizing roland by the arm made
two strides across the floor the apartment
to a small window through which the light
fell full on her face and shewed the astonished
youth the countenance magdalen
graeme yes roland she said thine
eyes deceive thee not they shew thee truly
the features her whom thou hast thyself
deceived whose wine thou hast turned into
gall her bread joyfulness into bitter poison
her hope into the blackest despair it is
she who now demands thee what meekest
the abbot
thou here she whose heaviest sin towards
heaven hath been that she loved thee even
better than the weal the whole church
and could not without reluctance surrender
thee even in the cause god she now
asks you what meekest thou here 
while she spoke she kept her broad black
eye rivetted on the youth's face with the
expression with which the eagle regards his
prey ere he tears it to pieces roland felt
himself at the moment incapable either
 reply or evasion this extraordinary
enthusiast had preserved over him in some
measure the ascendancy which she had
acquired during his childhood and besides
he knew the violence her passions and
her impatience contradiction and was
sensible that almost any reply which he
could make was like to throw her into an
ecstacy rage he was therefore silent
and magdalen graeme proceeded with encreasing
enthusiasm in her apostrophe
 once more what seek'st thou false boy
seest thou the honour thou hast renown
s the abbot
cet the faith thou hast abandoned the
hopes thou hast destroyed or didst thou
seek me the sole protectress thy youth
the only parent whom thou hast known
that thou mayst trample on my grey hairs
even as thou hast already trampled on the
best wishes my heart
 pardon me mother said roland
gramme j but in truth and reason deserve
not your blame i have been treated
amongst you even by yourself my reverend
parent as well as by others as one who
lacked the common attributes freewill
and human reason or was at least deemed
unfit to exercise them a land enchantment
have i been led into and spells have
been cast around me every one has met
me in disguise every one has spoke to mein
parables i have been like one who walks
in a weary and bewildering dream and now
you blame me that i have not the sense and
judgment and steadiness a waking and
a disenchanted and a reasonable man who
knows what he is doing and wherefore he
the abbot 
does it if one must walk with masks and
spectres who waft themselves from place to
place as it were in vision rather than reality
it might shake the soundest faith and turn
the wisest head i sought since i must
needs avow my folly the same catherine
seyton with whom you made me first acquainted
and whom i most strangely find
in this village kinross gayest among the
revellers when i had but just left her in the
wellguarded castle lochleven the sad
attendant an imprisoned queen i sought
her and in her place i find you my mother
more strangely disguised than even she is
 and what hadst thou to do with catherine
seyton said the matron sternly 
 is this a time or a world to follow maidens
or to dance around a maypole when the
trumpet summons every truehearted scotsman
around the standard the true sovereign
shalt thou be found loitering in a
lady's bower 
no by heaven nor imprisoned in the
rugged walls an island castle answered
 the abbot
roland grseme i would the blast were
to sound even now for i fear that nothing
less loud will dispel the chimerical visions
by which i am surrounded
 doubt not that it will be winded said
the matron and that so fearfully loud that
scotland will never hear the like until the
last and loudest blast all shall announce
to mountain and to valley that time is no
more meanwhile be thou but brave and
constant serve god and honour thy sovereign
 abide by thy religion i cannot 
i will not i dare not ask thee the truth 
the terrible surmises i have heard touching
thy falling away perfect not that accursed
sacrifice and yet even at this late hour
thou mayst be what i have hoped for the
son my dearest hope what say i theson
omy hope thou shalt be the hope scotland
her boast and her honour even thy
wildest and most foolish wishes may perchance
be fulfilled i shame to mingle meaner
motives with the noble guerdon i hold out
to thee it shames me being such as i am
the abbot 
to mention the idle passions youth save
with contempt and the purpose censure
but we must bribe children to wholesome
medicine by the offer cates and youth
to honourable achievement with the promise
 pleasure mark me therefore roland
the love catherine seyton will
follow him only who shall achieve the freedom
 her mistress and believe it maybe
one day in thine own power to be
that happy lover cast therefore away
doubt and fear and prepare to do what religion
calls for what thy country demands
 thee what thy duty as a subject and asa
servant alike require at your hand and
be assured even the idlest wishes thy
heart will be most readily attained by following
the call thy duty
as she ceased speaking a double knock
was heard against the inner door the matron
hastily adjusting her muffler and resuming
her chair by the hearth demanded
who was there
 the abbot
 salve in nomine sanctity was answered
from without
salute et vos answered magdalen
graeme
and a man entered in the ordinary dress
 a nobleman's retainer wearing at his
girdle a sword and buckler sought
you said he my mother and him whom
i see with you then addressing himself
to roland graeme he said to him hast
thou not a packet from george douglas 
 i have said the page suddenly recollecting
that which had been committed to
his charge in the morning but i may not
deliver it to any one without some token
that they have right to ask it
 you say well replied the servingman
and whispered into his ear the packet
which i ask is the report to his father will
this token suffice 
 it will replied the page and taking
the packet from his bosom gave it to the
man
the abbot 
 i will return presently said the 
and left the cottage
roland had now sufficiently recovered his
surprise to accost his relative in turn and
request to know the reason why he found
her in so precarious a disguise and a place
so dangerous you cannot be ignorant
he said the hatred that the lady 
lochleven bears to those your that is
 our religion your present disguise lays
you open to suspicions a different kind
but inferring no less hazard and whether
as a catholic or as a sorceress or as a friend
to the unfortunate queen you are in equal
danger if apprehended within the bounds
 thedouglasandinthechamberlainwho
administers their authority you have for
his own reasons an enemy and a bitter one
 i know it said the matron her eyes
kindling with triumph i know that vain
 his school craft and carnal wisdom luke
lundin views with jealousy and hatred the
blessings which the saints have conferred on
my prayers and on the holy reliques before
 the abbot
the touch nay before the bare presence 
which disease and death have so often been
known to retreat i know he would rend
and tear me but there is a chain and a
muzzle on the ban dog that shall restrain
his fury and the master's servant shall not
be offended by him until the master's work
is wrought when that hour comes let the
shadows the evening descend on me in
thunder and in tempest the time shall be
welcome that relieves my eyes from seeing
guilt and my ears from listening to blasphemy
do thou but be constant play
thy part as i have played and will play
mine and my release shall be like that a
blessed martyr which angels hail with psalm
and song while earth pursues him with hiss
and with execration
as she concluded the servingman again
entered the cottage and said all is well 
the time holds for tomorrow night
 what time what holds exclaimed
roland grasme trust i have given the
douglas's packet to no wrong
the abbot 
content yourself young man answered
the serving man thou hast my word
and token
 i know not if the token be right said
the page and i care not much for the
word a stranger
what said the matron although
thou mayst have given a packet delivered
to thy charge by one the queen's rebels
into the hand a loyal subject there were
no great mistake in that thou hotbrained
boy
 by saint andrew there were foul mistake
though answered the page it is
the very spirit my duty in this first stage
 chivalry to be faithful to my trust and
had the devil given me a message to discharge
i would not so i had plighted my
faith to the contrary betray his counsel to
an angel light
now by the love i once bore thee said
the matron i could slay thee with mine
own hand when hear thee talk a dearer
 the abbot
faith being due to rebels and heretic than
thou west to thy church and thy prince 
 be patient my good sister said the
serving man i will give him such reasons
as shall counterbalance the scruples which
beset him the spirit is honourable though
now it may be mistimed and misplaced 
follow me young man
 ere i go to call this stranger to a reckoning
said the page to the matron is
there nothing i can do for your comfort
and safety r
 nothing she replied nothing save
what will lead more to thy own honour the
saints who have protected me thus far will
lend me succour as i need it tread the
path glory that is before thee and only
think me as the creature on earth who
will be most delighted to hear thy fame
follow the stranger he hath tidings for
you that you little expect
the stranger remained on the threshold
as if waiting for roland and whenever he
the abbot 
saw him put himself in motion he moved
on before him at a quick pace diving
still deeper down the lane roland perceived
that it was now bordered by buildings
upon the one side only and that the
other was fenced by a high old wall over
which some trees extended their branches
descending a good way farther they came
to a small door in the wall roland's guide
paused looked around for an instant to see
if any one were within sight then taking
a key from his pocket opened the door and
entered making a sign to roland grasme
to follow him the guided did so and the
stranger locked the door carefully on the
inside during this operation the page had
a moment to look around and perceived
that he was in a small orchard very trimly
kept
the stranger led him through an alley or
two shaded by trees loaded with summerfruit
into a pleached arbour where taking
the turf seat which was on the one side he
motioned to roland to occupy that which
 the abbot
was opposite to him and after a momentary
silence opened the conversation as follows 
you have asked a better warrant than the
word a mere stranger to satisfy you that
i have the authority george douglas
for possessing myself the packet entrusted
to your charge 
 it is precisely the point on which demand
reckoning you said roland i
fear i have acted hastily if so must redeem
my error as i best may
you hold me then as a perfect stranger
said the man look at my face more
attentively and see if the features do not
resemble those a man much known to
you formerly
roland gazed attentively but the ideas
recalled to his mind were so inconsistent
with the mean and servile dress the person
before him that he did not venture to
express the opinion which he was irresistibly
induced to form
yes my son said the stranger observing
his embarrassment you do indeed
the abbot 
see before you the unfortunate father ambrose
who once accounted his ministry
crowned in your preservation from the
snares heresy but who is now condemned
to lament thee as a castaway 
roland graeme's kindness heart was
at least equal to his vivacity temper he
could not bear to see his ancient and honoured
master and spiritual guide in a situation
which inferred a change fortune
so melancholy but throwing himself at his
feet grasped his knees and wept aloud
 what mean these tears my son said
the abbot if they are shed for your own
sins and follies surely they are gracious
showers and may avail thee much but
weep not if they fall on my account you
indeed see the superior the community
 saint mary's in the dress a poor shorter
who gives his master the use his blade
and buckler and if needful his life for a
coarse livery coat and four marks by the
year but such a garb suits the time and
 the abbot
in the period the church militant as well
becomes her prelates as staff mitre and
crosier in the days the church's triumph
 by what fate said the page and yet
why added he checking himself need
i ask catherine seyton in some sort prepared
me for this but that the change
should be so absolute the destruction so
complete 
 yes my son said the abbot ambrosius
 thine own eyes beheld in my unworthy
elevation to the abbot's stall the
last especial act holy solemnity which
shall be seen in the church saint mary's
until it shall please heaven to turn back the
captivity the church for the present the
shepherd is smitten ay well nigh to the
earth the flock are scattered and the
shrines saints and martyrs and pious benefactors
to the church are given to the
owls night and the satyrs the desert
and your brother the knight 
 could he do nothing for your protection

the abbot 
he himself hath fallen under the suspicion
 the ruling powers said the abbot
 who are as unjust to their friends as
they are cruel to their enemies i could
not grieve at it did i hope it might estrange
him from his course but i know the soul
 halbert and i rather fear it will drive
him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy
cause by some deed which may be yet more
destructive to the church and rare offensive
to heaven enough this and now
to the business our meeting i trust you
will hold it sufficient if i pass my word to
you that the packet which you were lately
the bearer was designed for my hands by
george douglas 
 then said the page is george 
douglas
 a true friend to his queen roland
and will soon i trust have his eyes opened
to the errors his miscalled church
 but what is he to his father and what
to the lady lochleven who has been
vol ill c
 the abbot
as a mother to him said the page impatiently

 the best friend to both in time and
through eternity said the abbot if he
shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming
the evil they have wrought and
are still working
 still said the page i like not that
good service which begins in breach 
trust
i blame not thy scruples my son said
the abbot but the time which has wrenched
asunder the allegiance christians to
the church and subjects to their king
has dissolved all the lesser bonds society 
and in such days mere human ties must no
more restrain our progress than the brambles
and briars which catch hold his garments
should delay the path a pilgrim
who travels to pay his vows
but my father said the youth and
then stopped short in a hesitating manner
speak on my son said the abbot j
speak without fear
cc
the abbot 
 let me not offend you then said roland
 when i say that it is even this which
our adversaries charge against us that shaping
the means according to the we are
willing to commit great moral evil in order
that we may work out eventual good
 the heretics have played their usual
arts on you my son said the abbot they
would willingly deprive us the power
 acting wisely and secretly though their
possession superior force forbids our contending
with them on the terms equality
they have reduced us to a state exhausted
weakness and now would fain proscribe
the means by which weakness through
all the range nature supplies the lack
 strength and defends itself against its
potent enemies as well might the hound
say to the hare use not these wily turns to
escape me but contend with me in pitched
battle as the armed and powerful heretic
demand the down trodden and oppressed
catholic to lay aside the wisdom the serpent
by which alone they may again hope
 the abbot
to raise up the jerusalem over which the
weep and which it is their duty to rebuild
but more this hereafter and now
my son i command thee on thy faith to
tell me truly and particularly what has chanced
to thee since we parted and what is
the present state thy conscience thy
relation our sister magdalen is a woman
 excellent gifts blessed with a zeal which
neither doubt nor danger can quench but
yet it is not a zeal altogether according to
knowledge wherefore ray son i would
willingly be myself thy interrogator and thy
counsellor in these days darkness and
stratagem
with the respect which he owed to his
first instructor roland graeme went rapidly
through the events which the reader is
acquainted with and while he disguised
not from the prelate the impression which
had been made on his mind by the arguments
 the preacher henderson he accidentally
and almost involuntarily gave
his father confessor to understand the inthe
abbot 
fluence which catherine seyton had acquired
over his mind
it is with joy i discover my dearest
son replied the abbot that i have arrived
in time to arrest thee on the verge 
the precipice to which thou wert approaching
these doubts which you complain
are the weeds which naturally grow up ina
strong soil and require the careful hand
 the husbandman to eradicate them thou
must study a little volume which i will
impart to thee in fitting time in which by
our lady's grace i have placed in somewhat
a clearer light than heretofore the
points debated betwixt us and these heretics
who sow among the wheat the same
tares which were formerly privily mingled
with the good seed by the albigenses and
the dollars but it is not by reason alone
that you must hope to conquer these insinuations
 the enemy it is sometimes
by timely resistance but oftener by timely
flight you must shut your ears against
the arguments the heresiarch when circe
the abbot
substances permit you not to withdraw
the foot from his company anchor your
thoughts upon the service our lady
while he is expending in vain his heretical
sophistry are you unable to maintain
your attention on heavenly objects think
rather on thine own earthly pleasures than
tempt providence and the saints by giving
an attentive ear to the erring doctrine 
think thy hawk thy hound thine anglingrod
thy sword and buckler think even
 catherine seyton rather than give thy
soul to the lessons the tempter alas my
son believe not that worn out with woes
and bent more by affliction than by years
i have forgotten the effect beauty over
the heart youth even in the watches 
the night broken by thoughts an imprisoned
queen a distracted kingdom a church
laid waste and ruinous come other thoughts
than these suggest and feelings which belonged
to an earlier and happier course 
life be it so we must bear our load as
we may j and not in vain are these passions
the abbot 
implanted in our breast since as now in
thy case they may come in aid resolutions
founded upon higher grounds yet
beware my son this catherine seyton is
the daughter one scotland's proudest
as well as most worthy barons j and thy
state may not suffer thee as yet to aspire
so high but thus it is heaven works its
purposes through human folly and douglas's
ambitious affection as well as thine
shall contribute alike to the desired 
 how my father said the page my
suspicions are then true douglas loves 
 he does and with a love as much
misplaced as thine own j but beware him
cross him not thwart him not
let him not cross or thwart me said
the page for i will not yield him an
inch way had he in his body the soul 
every douglas that has lived since the time
 the dark grey man
nay have patience idle boy and re
fleet that your suit can never interfere with
his a truce with these vanities and let us
 the abbot
better employ the little space which it still
remains to us to spend together to thy
knees my son and resume the long interrupted
duty confession that happen
what may the hour may find in thee a faithful
catholic relieved from the guilt his
sins by authority the holy church could
i but tell thee roland the joy with which
i see thee once more put thy knee to its
best and fittest use quid dicis mi fill 
culpas easy answered the youth and
according to the ritual the catholic
church he confessed and received absolution
to which was annexed the condition
 performing certain enjoined penances
when this religious ceremony was ended
an old man in the dress a peasant 
the better order approached the arbour
and greeted the abbot i have waited
the conclusion your devotions he said
 to tell you the youth is sought after by
the chamberlain and it were well he were
to appear without delay holy saint francis
if the halberdiers were to seek him here
the abbot 
they might sorely wrong my gardenplot 
they are in office and reck not where they
tread were each step on jessamine and
clovecauliflowers
 we will speed him forth my brother
said the abbot but alas is it possible
that such trifles should live in your mind
at a crisis so awful as that which is now impending

 reverend father answered the proprietor
 the garden for such he was how
oft shall i pray you to keep your high counsel
for high minds like your own what
have you required me that i have not
granted unresisting though with a sore
heart r
 i would require you to be yourself
my brother said the abbot ambrosius 
 to remember what you were and to what
your early vows have bound you
i tell thee father ambrosius replied
the gardener the patience the best
saint that ever said paternoster would be
exhausted by the trials to which you have
c 
 the abbot
put mine what i have been it skills not
to speak at present no one knows better
than yourself father what i renounced
in hopes to find ease and quiet during the
remainder my days and no one better
knows how my retreat has been invaded
my fruittrees broken my flowerbeds
trodden down my quiet frightened away
and my very sleep driven from my bed
since ever this poor queen god bless
her hath been sent to lochleven i blame
her not j being a prisoner it is natural she
should wish to get out from so vile a hold
where there is scarce any place even for a
tolerable garden and where the watermists
as i am told blight all the early blossoms
 i say i cannot blame her for endeavouring
for her freedom but why i should be
drawn into the scheme why my harmless
arbours that i planted with my own hands
should become places privy conspiracy
why my little quay which i built for my
own fishing boat should have become a haven
for secret embarkations in short why
the abbot 
i should be dragged into matters where
both heading and hanging are like to bethe
issue i profess to you reverend father
i am totally ignorant
my brother answered the abbot
you are wise and ought to know
i am not i am not i am not wise
replied the horticulturist pettishly and
stopping his ears with his fingers i was
never called wise but when men wanted
to engage me in some action notorious
folly
 but my good brother said the abbots

 am not good neither said the gardener
 i am neither good nor wise had
i been wise you would not have been admitted
here and were i good methinks 
would send you elsewhere to hatch plots
for destroying the quiet the country
what signifies disputing about queen or
king when men may sit at peace sui uniira
viris sui and so would i do after the
precept holy writ were i as you term
 the abbot
me wise or good but such as i am my
neck is in the yoke and you make me draw
what weight you list follow me youngster
this reverend father who makes in his
jackman's dress nearly as reverend a figure
as i myself will agree with me in one thing
at least and that is that you have been
long enough here
 follow the good father roland said
the abbot and remember my words a
day is approaching that will try the temper
 all true scotsmen may thy heart prove
faithful as the steel thy blade 
the page bowed in silence and they parted
 the gardener notwithstanding his advanced
age walking on before him very
briskly and muttering as he went partly to
himself partly to his companion after the
manner old men weakened intellects 
 when i was great thus run his maundering
 and had my mule and my ambling
palfrey at command i warrant you
i could have as well flown through the
hair as have walked at this pace i had my
the abbot l
gout and my rheumatics and an hundred
things beside that hung fetters on my
heels and now thanks to our lady and
honest labour i can walk with any goodman
 my age in the kingdom fife 
fie upon it that experience should be so
long in coming
as he was thus muttering his eye fell
upon the branch a pear tree which drooped
down for want support and at once
forgetting his haste the old man stopped
and set seriously about binding it up roland
graeme had both readiness neatness
 hand and good nature in abundance 
he immediately lent his aid and in a minute
or two the bough was supported and
tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to
the old man who looked at it with great
complaisance they are bargains he
said and if you will come ashore in
autumn you shall taste them the like
are not in lochleven castle the garden
there is a poor pinfold and the gardener
hugh oakham hath little skill his
 the abbot
craft come ashore master page in autumn
when you would eat pears but what
am i thinking ere that time come they
may have given thee sour pears for plums
take an old man's advice youth one who
hath seen many days and sat in higher
places than thou canst hope for bend thy
sword into a pruninghook and make a
dibble thy dagger thy days shall be the
longer and thy health the better for it and
come to aid me in my garden and i will
teach thee the real french fashion imp
whig which the southron call grafting do
this and do it without loss time for there
is a whirlwind coming over the land and
only those shall escape who lie too much beneath
the storm to have their boughs broken
by it
so saying he dismissed roland greene
through a door different from that by which
he had enteredjsigned a cross and pronounced
a benedicite as they parted and then
still muttering to himself retired into the
garden and locked the door on the inside
the abbot 
chapter iii
pray god she prove not masculine ere long 
king henry 
dismissed from the old man's garden roland
graeme found that a grassy paddock
in which sauntered two cows the property
 the gardener still separated him from
the village he paced through it lost in
meditation upon the words the abbot
father ambrosius had vith success enough
exerted over him that reverential influence
which the guardians and instructors our
childhood possess over our more mature
youth and yet when roland looked back
upon what the father had said he could
not but suspect that he had rather sought
to evade entering into the controversy beck
the abbot
twixt the churches than to repel the objections
and satisfy the doubts which the
lectures henderson had excited for
this he had no time said the page to
himself neither have i now calmness and
learning sufficient to judge upon points
 such magnitude besides it were base
to quit my faith while the wind fortune
sets against it unless i were so placed
that my conversion should it take place
were free as light from the imputation 
self interest i was bred a catholic bredin
the faith bruce and wallace i will
hold that faith till time and reason shall
convince me that it errs i will serve this
poor queen as a subject should serve an imprisoned
and wronged sovereign they wha
placed me in her service have to blame themselves
 they sent me hither a gentleman
trained in the paths loyalty and honour
when they should have sought out some
truckling cogging doubledealing knave
who would have been at once the observant
page the queen and the obsequious spy
the abbot 
 her enemies since i must chuse betwixt
aiding and betraying her i will decide
as becomes her servant and her subject
j but catherine seyton catherine
seyton beloved by douglas and holding
me on or off as the intervals her leisure
or caprice will permit how shall i deal
with the coquette by heaven when i
next have an opportunity she shall render
me some reason for her conduct or i will
break with her for ever
as he formed this doughty resolution he
crossed the stile which led out the little
enclosure and was almost immediately
greeted by dr luke lundin
ha my most excellent young friend
said the doctor from whence come you 
but i note the place yes neighbour
blinkhoolie's garden is a pleasant rendezvous
and you are the age when lads look
after a bonny lass with one eye and a dainty
plum with another but hey i you look
sub tri stand melancholic i fear the maiden
has proved cruel or the plums unripe j and
 the abbot
surely think neighbour blinkhoolie's damsons
can scarce have been well preserved
throughout the winter he spares the saccharine
juice on his confects but courage
man there are more rates in kinross and
for the immature fruit a glass my double
distilled aqua nirahilisprohattim est
the page darted an ireful glance at the
facetious physician but presently recollecting
that the name kate which had provoked
his displeasure was probably but introduced
for the sake alliteration he suppressed
his wrath and only asked if the
pains had been heard 
 why i have been seeking for you this
hour to tell you that the stuff is in your
boat and that the boat waits your pleasure
auchtermuchty had only fallen into company
with an idle knave like himself and a
stoup aquavitas between them your
boatmen lie on their oars and there have
already been made two wets from the warder's
turret to intimate that those in the
castle are impatient for your return yet
the abbot 
there is time for you to take a slight repast 
and as your friend and physician i hold it
unfit you should face the waterbreeze with
an empty stomach
roland graeme had nothing for it but to
return with such cheer as he might to the
place where his boat was moored on the
beach and resisted all offer refreshment
although the doctor promised that he should
prelude the collation with a gentle appe
tierra decoction herbs gathered and
distilled by himself indeed as roland had
not forgotten the contents his morning
cup it is possible that the recollection induced
him to stand firm in his refusal all
food to which such an unpalatable 
was to be annexed as they passed towards
the boat for the ceremonious politeness
 the worthy chamberlain would not
permit the page to go thither without attendance
roland graeme amidst a group who
seemed to be assembled around a party 
wandering musicians distinguished as he
 the abbot
thought the dress catherine seyton he
shook himself clear from his attendant and
at one spring was in the midst the crowd
and at the side the damsel catherine
he whispered is it well for you to
be still here will you not return to the
castle 
to the devil with your catherine and
your castles answered the maiden snappishly
 have you not had time enough already
to get rid your follies begone i
desire not your farther company and there
will be danger in thrusting it upon me
nay but if there be danger fairest
catherine replied roland why will you
not allow me to stay and share it with you 
intruding fool said the maiden the
danger is all on thine own side the risk
is in plain terms that i strike thee on the
mouth with the hilt my dagger so saying
she turned haughtily from him and
moved through the crowd who gave way
in some astonishment at the masculine acthe
abbot 
activity with which she forced her way among
them
as roland though much irritated prepared
to follow he was grappled on the
other side by doctor luke lundin who
reminded him the loaded boat the two
wets or signals with the flag which had
been made from the tower the danger 
the cold breeze to an empty stomach and
 the vanity spending more time upon
coy wenches and sour plums roland was
thus in a manner dragged back to his
boat and obliged to launch her forth upon
his return to lochleven castle
that little voyage was speedily accomplished
and the page was greeted at the
landingplace by the severe and caustic welcome
 old dryfesdale so young gallant
you are come at last after a delay 
six hours and after two signals from the
castle but i warrant some idle upsetting
had occupied you too deeply to think 
your service or your duty where is the
note the plate and household stuff 
 the abbot
pray heaven it hath not been diminished
under the sleeveless care so young a gadabout

 diminished under my care sir steward
 retorted the page angrily say soin
earnest and by heaven your grey hair
shall hardly protect your saucy tongue 
 a truce with your swaggering young
esquire returned the steward we have
bolts and dungeons for brawlers go to my
lady and swagger before her if thou darest
 she will give thee proper cause 
offence for she has waited thee long and
impatiently
 and where then is the lady lochleven
 said the page for i conceive it
is her thou speaks
 ay whom else replied clydesdale
 or who besides the lady lochleven
hath a right to command in this castle

the lady lochleven is thy mistress
said roland graeme i but mine is
the queen scotland
the abbot 
the steward looked at him fixedly for a
moment with an air in which suspicion and
dislike were ill concealed by an affectation
 contempt the bragging cockchicken
he said will betray himself by his hath
crowing i have marked thy changed manner
in the chapel late ay and your
changing glances at mealtime with a
certain idle damsel who like thyself laughs
at all gravity and goodness there is something
about you my master which should
be looked to but if you would know
whether heady lochleven or that other
lady hath right to command thy service
thou wilt find them together in the lady
mary's antiroom
roland hastened thither not unwilling to
escape from the illnatured penetration 
the old man and marvelling at the same time
what peculiarity could have occasioned the
lady lochleven's being in the queen's
apartment at this time the afternoon so
much contrary to her usual wont his
 the abbot
acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning
she wishes he concluded to see the
meeting betwixt the queen and me on my
return that she may form a guess whether
there is any private intelligence or understanding
betwixt us i must be guarded
with this resolution he entered the parlour
where the queen seated in her chair
with the lady fleming leaning upon the
back it had already kept the lady 
lochleven standing in her presence for the
space nearly an hour to the manifest increase
 her very visible bad humour roland
graeme on entering the apartment
made a deep obeisance to the queen and another
to the lady and then stood still as if to
await their further question speaking almost
together the lady lochleven said
 so young man you are returned at
length 
and then stopped indignantly short
while the queen went on without regarding
her roland you are welcome home
the abbot 
to us you have proved the true dove and
not the raven yet i am sure i could have
forgiven you if once dismissed from this
water circled ark ours you had never
again returned to us i trust you have
brought back an olive branch for our kind
and worthy hostess has chafed herself much
on account your long absence and we
never needed more some symbol peace
and reconciliation
 i grieve i should have been detained
madam answered the page but from the
delay the person entrusted with the matters
for which i was sent i did not receive
them till late in the day
 see you there now said the queen
to the lady lochleven we could not
persuade you our dearest hostess that your
household goods were in all safe keeping
and surety true it is that we can excuse
your anxiety considering that these august
apartments are so scantily furnished that
we have not been able to offer you even the
vol iii d
 the abbot
relief a stool during the long time you
have afforded us the pleasure your society

 the will madam said the lady
 the will to offer such accommodation was
more wanting than the means
 what said the queen looking round
and affecting surprise there are then
stools in this apartment one two no less
than four including the broken one a royal
garniture we observed them not will it
please your ladyship to sit 
 no madam i will soon relieve you 
my presence replied the lady lochleven 
 and while with you my aged limbs can
still better brook fatigue than my mind
stoop to accept constrained courtesy
 nay lady lochleven if you take
it so deeply said the queen rising and
motioning to her own vacant chair i
would rather you assumed my seat you
are not the first your family who has done
so

the abbot 
the lady lochleven curtsied a negative
but seemed with much difficulty to
suppress the angry answer which rose to her
lips
during this sharp conversation the page's
attention had been almost entirely occupied
by the entrance catherine seyton
who came from the inner apartment in the
usual dress in which she attended upon the
queen and with nothing in her manner
which marked either the hurry or confusion
incident to a hasty change disguise or
the conscious fear detection in a perilous
enterprize roland giseme ventured to
make her an obeisance as she entered but
she returned it with an air the utmost indifference
which in his opinion was extremely
inconsistent with the circumstances
in which they stood towards each other
surely he thought she cannot in reason
expect to bully me out the belief
due to mine own eyes as she tried to do
concerning the apparition in the hostelry 
saint michael's i will try if i cannot make
 the abbot
her feel that this will be but a vain task
and that confidence in me is the wiser and
safer course to pursue
thesethoughts had passed rapidly through
his mind when the queen having finished
her altercation with the lady the castle
again addressed him what the revels
at kinross roland grasme methought
they were gay if i may judge from some
faint sounds mirth and distant music
which found their way so far as these grated
windows and died when they entered them
as all that is mirthful must but thou lookest
as sad as if thou hadst come from a conventicle
 the huguenots 
and so perchance he hath madam
replied the lady lochleven at whom
this sideshaft was launched i trust amid
yonder idle fooleries there wanted not some
pouring forth doctrine to a better purpose
than that vain mirth which blazing
and vanishing like the crackling dry
thorns leaves to the fools who love it nothing
but dust and ashes
the abbot 
 mary fleming said the queen turning
round and drawing her mantle around
her i would that we had the chimneygrate
supplied with a faggot or two these
same thorns which the lady lochleven
describes so well methinks the damp air
from the lake which stagnates in these
vaulted rooms renders them deadly cold
your grace's pleasure shall be obeyed
said the lady lochleven yet may i
presume to remind you that we are now in
summer 
i thank you for the information my
good lady said the queen for prisoners
better learn their calendar from the mouth
 their jailor than from any change they
themselves feel in the seasons once more
roland grme what the revels 
 they were gay madam said the page
 but the usual sort and little worth your
highness's ear
 o you know not said the queen
how very indulgent my ear has become
s the abbot
to all that speaks freedom and the pleasures
 the free methinks i would rather
have seen the gay villagers dance their
ring round the maypole than have witnessed
the most stately masques within the
walls a palace the absence stonewalls
 the sense that the green turf is under
the foot which may tread it free and
unrestrained is worth all that art or splendour
can add to more courtly revels
i trust said the lady lochleven addressing
the page in her turn there were
amongst these follies none the riots or
disturbances to which they so naturally
lead 
roland gave a slight glance to catherine
seyton as if to bespeak her attention as he
replied i witnessed no offence madam
worthy marking none indeed any
kind save that a bold damsel made her hand
somewhat too familiar with the cheek a
playerman and ran some hazard being
ducked in the lake
the arbor 
as he uttered these words he cast a hasty
glance at catherine but she sustained with
the utmost serenity manner and countenance
the hint which he had deemed could
not have been thrown out before her without
exciting some fear and confusion
 i will cumber your grace no longer
with my presence said the lady cochlea
 unless you have aught to command
me
 nought our good hostess answered
the queen unless it be to pray you that
on another occasion you deem it not needful
to postpone your better employment to
wait so long upon us
 may it please you added the lady
lochleven to command this your gentleman
to attend us that may receive some
account these matters which have been
sent hither for your grace's use
we may not refuse what you are pleased
to require madam answered the queen
 go with the lady roland if our como
the abbot
hands be indeed necessary to thy doing so
we will hear tomorrow the history thy
kinross pleasures for this night we dismiss
thy attendance
roland graeme went with the lady 
lochleven who failed not to ask him many
questions concerning what had passed at
the sports to which he rendered such answers
as were most likely to lull asleep any
suspicions which she might entertain his
disposition to favour queen mary taking
especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition
 magdalen graeme and the
abbot ambrosius at length after undergoing
a long and somewhat close examination
he was dismissed with such expressions
as coming from the reserved and
stern lady lochleven might seem to
express a degree favour and countenance
his first care was to obtain some refreshment
which was more cheerfully afforded
him by a goodnatured panther than by
dryfesdale who was on this occasion much
the abbot 
disposed to abide by the fashion 
house where
they who came not the first call
gat no more meat till the next meal
when roland graeme had finished his
repast having his dismissal from the queen
for the evening and being little inclined
for such society as the castle afforded he
stole into the garden in vhich he had permission
to spend his leisure time when it
pleased him in this place the ingenuity
 the contriver and disposer the walks
had exerted itself to make the most little
space and by screens both stone ornamented
with rude sculpture and hedges 
living green had endeavoured to give as
much intricacy and variety as the confined
limits the garden would admit
here the young man walked sadly considering
the events the day and comparing
what had dropped from the abbot
with what he had himself noticed the
demeanour george douglas it must
be so was the painful but inevitable con

 the abbot
elusion at which he arrived it must be
by his aid that she is thus enabled like a
phantom to transport herself from place
to place and to appear at pleasure on the
mainland or on the islet it must be so
he repeated once more j with him she
holds a close secret and intimate correspondence
altogether inconsistent with the
eye favour which she has sometimes
cast upon me and destructive to the hopes
which she must have known these glances
have necessarily inspired and yet for
love will hope where reason despairs the
thought rushed on his mind that it was possible
she only encouraged douglas's passion
so far as might serve her mistress's interest
and that she was too frank noble and
candid a nature to hold out to himself hopes
which she meant not to fulfil lost in these
various conjectures he seated himself upon
a bank turf which commanded a view
 the lake on the one side and on the other
 that front the castle amongst which the
queen's apartments were situated
the abbot 
the sun had now for some time set and
the twilight may was rapidly fading into
a serene night on the lake the expanded
water rose and fell with the slightest and
softest influence a southern breeze which
scarcely dimpled the surface over which it
passed in the distance was still seen the
dim outline the island saint serf once
visited by many a sandalled pilgrim as the
blessed spot trodden by a man god 
now neglected or violated as the refuge 
lazy priests who had with justice been compelled
to give place to the sheep and the
heifers a protestant baron
as roland gazed on the dark speck
amid the lighter blue the waters which
surrounded it the mazes polemical discussion
again stretched themselves before the
eye his mind had these men justly suffered
their exile as licentious drones the
robbers at once and disgrace the busy
hive or had the hand avarice and rapine
expelled from the temple not the 
the abbot
balls who polluted but the faithful priests
who served the shrine in honour and fidelity
i the arguments henderson in this
contemplative hour rose with double force
before him and could scarce be parried by
the appeal which the abbot ambrosius
had made from his understanding to his
feelings an appeal which he had felt more
forcibly amid the bustle stirring yit'e
than it now seemed to his more undisturbed
reflection it required an effort to
divert his mind from this embarrassing topic
 and he found that he best succeeded
by turning his eyes to the front the
tower watching where a twinkling light
still streamed from the casement catherine
seyton's apartment obscured by times
for a moment as the shadow the fair
inhabitant passed betwixt the taper and
the window at length the light was removed
or extinguished and that object 
speculation was also withdrawn from the
eyes the meditative lover dare i cones
the abbot 
fessthe fact without injuring his character
for ever as a hero romance these eyes
gradually became heavy speculative doubts
on the subject religious controversy and
anxious conjectures concerning the state 
his mistress's affections became confusedly
blended together in his musings the fatigues
 a busy day prevailed over the harassing
subjects contemplation which occupied
his mind and he fell fast asleep
sound were his slumbers until they were
suddenly dispelled by the iron tongue the
castle bell which sent its deep and sullen
sounds wide over the bosom the lake and
awakened the echoes bennarty the hill
which descends steeply on its southern bank
roland started up for this bell was always
tolled at ten o'clock as the signal for locking
the castle gates and placing the keys
under the charge the seneschal he therefore
hastened to the wicket by which the
garden communicated with the building
and had the mortification just as he reached
the abbot
ed it to hear the bolt leave its sheath with
a discordant crash and enter the stone
groove the doorjinteh
 hold hold cried the page and let
me in ere you lock the wicket
the voice dryfesdale replied from
within in his usual tone embittered sullenness
 the hour is passed fair master
you like not the inside these walls 
even make it a complete holiday and pass
the night as well as the day out bounds
open the door exclaimed the indignant
page or by saint giles i will make
thy gold chain smoke for it 
make no alarm here retorted the impenetrable
dryfesdale but keep thy sinful
oaths and silly threats for those that regard
them i do mine office and carry the
keys to the seneschal adieu my young
master the cool night air will advantage
your hot blood
the steward was right in what he said 
for the cooling breeze was very necessary
to appease the feverish fit anger which
the abbot 
roland experienced nor did the remedy
succeed for some time at length after
some hasty turns made through the garden
exhausting his passion in vain vows vengeance
roland graeme began to be sensible
that his situation ought rather to beheld
as matter laughter than serious
resentment to one bred a sportsman a
night spent in the open air had in it little
 hardship and the poor malice the
steward seemed more worthy his contempt
than his anger i would to god he
said that the grim old man may always have
contented himself with such sportive revenge
he often looks as he were capable
 doing us a darker turn returning therefore
to the turfseat which he had formerly
occupied and which was partially sheltered
by a trim fence green holly he drew his
mantle around him stretched himself at
length on the verdant settle and endeavoured
to resume that sleep which the 
had interrupted to so little purpose
sleep like other earthly blessings is nigh
the abbot
gard its favours when most courted the
more roland invoked her aid the further
she fled from his eyelids he had been
completely awakened first by the sounds 
the bell and then by his own aroused vivacity
 temper and he found it difficult
again to compose himself to slumber at
length when his mind was wearied out with
a maze unpleasing meditation he succeeded
in coaxing himself into a broken
slumber this was again dispelled by the
voices two persons who were walking
in the garden the sound whose conversation
after mingling for some time in
the page's dreams at length succeeded
in awaking him thoroughly he raised
himself from his reclining posture in the
utmost astonishment which the circumstance
 hearing two persons at that late
hour conversing on the outside the
watchfully guarded castle lochleyen
was so well calculated to excite his first
thought was upon supernatural beings his
next upon some attempt on the part 
the abbot 
queen mary's friends and followers his last
was that george douglas possessed 
the keys and having the means ingress
and egress at pleasure was availing himself
 his office to hold a rendezvous with catherine
seyton in the castle garden he
was confirmed in this opinion by the tone
 the voice which asked in a low whispers
whether all was ready
 the abbot
chapter 
la some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent
like war's swart powder in a castlevault
until occasion like the linstock lights it 
then comes at once the lightning and the thunder 
and distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder
old play
roland grme availing himself a
breach in the holy screen and the assistance
 the full moon which was now
arisen had a perfect opportunity himself
unobserved to reconnoitre the persons and
the motions those by whom his rest had
been thus unexpectedly disturbed and his
observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions
they stood together in close and
earnest conversation within four yards 
the place his retreat and he could easily
recognize the tall form and deep voice 
the abbot 
douglas and the no less remarkable dress
and tone the page at the hostelry saint
michael's
 i have been at the door the page's
apartment said douglas but he is not
there or he will not answer it is fast bolted
on the inside as is the custom and we
cannot pass through it and what his silence
may bode i know not
you have trusted him too far said the
other a featherheaded coxcomb uxoris
whose changeable mind and hot brain there
is no making an abiding impression
it was not i who was willing to trust
him said douglas j but i was assured he
would prove friendly when called upon
for here he spoke so low that roland
lost the tenor his words which was the
more provoking as he was fully aware
that he was himself the subject their
conversation
nay replied the stranger more aloud
 i have on my side put him off with fail
 the abbot
words which make fools fain but now if
you distrust him at the push deal with him
with your dagger and so make open passage

 that were too rash said douglas 
and besides as i told you the door his
apartment is shut and bolted will essay
again to waken him
gramme instantly comprehended that the
ladies having been somehow made aware 
his being in the garden had secured the
door the outer room in which he usually
slept as a sort sentinel upon that only
access to the queen's apartments but then
how came catherine seyton to be abroad if
the queen and the other lady were still
within their chambers and the access to
them locked and bolted i will be instantly
at the bottom these mysteries
he said and then thank mrs catherine if
this be really she for the kind use which
she exhorted douglas to make his dagger
they seek me as i comprehend and they
shall not seek me in vain
the abbot 
douglas had by this time reentered the
castle by the wicket which was now open
the stranger stood alone in the garden walk
his arms folded on his breast and his eyes
cast impatiently up to the moon as if accusing
her betraying him by the magnificence
 her lustre in a moment roland
graeme stood before him a goodly
night he said mrs catherine for a
young lady to stray forth in disguise and
to meet with men in an orchard
 hush said the stranger page hush
thou foolish patch and tell us in a word
if thou art friend or foe
 how should i be friend to one who
deceives me by fair words and who would
have douglas deal with me with his poniard
 replied roland
the fiend receive george douglas
and thee too thou born madcap and sworn
marplot said the other we shall be discovered
and then death is the word
catherine said the page you have
dealt falsely and cruelly with me and the
 the abbot
moment explanation is now come neither
it nor you shall escape me
 madman said the stranger i am
neither kate nor catherine the moon
shines bright enough surely to know the
hart from the hind
that shift shall not serve you fair mistress
said the page laying hold on the lap
 the stranger's cloak this time at least
i will know with whom i deal
 unhand me said she endeavouring
to extricate herself from his grasp and in a 
tone where anger seemed to contend with
a desire to laugh use you so little discretion
towards a daughter seyton 
but as roland encouraged perhaps by
her risibility to suppose his violence was
not unpardonably offensive kept hold on
her mantle she said in a sterner tone 
vmraixed resentment madman let me
go there is life and death in this moment
i would not willingly hurt thee and yet
beware 
as she spoke she made a sudden effort
the abbot 
to escape and in doing so a pistol which
she carried in her hand or about her person
went off
this warhke sound instantly awakened
the well warded castle the warder blew
his horn and began to toll the castlebell
crying out at the same time fie treason 
treason cry all cry all 
the apparition catherine seyton
which the page had let loose in the first
moment astonishment vanished in darkness
but the plash oars was heard and
in a second or two five or six harquebusses
and a falconet were fired from the battlements
 the castle successively as if levelled
at some object on the water confounded
with these incidents no way for catherine's
protection supposing her to be in
the boat which he had heard put from the
shore occurred to roland save to have
recourse to george douglas he hastened
for this purpose towards the apartment
 the queen whence he heard loud
voices and much trampling feet when
 the abbot
he entered he found himself added to a
confused and astonished group which assembled
in that apartment stood gazing
upon each other at the upper the
room stood the queen equipped as for a
journey and attended not only by the lady
fleming but by the omnipresent catherine
seyton dressed in the habit her own sex
and bearing in her hand the casket in which
mary kept such jewels as she had been permitted
to retain at the other the
hall was the lady lochleven hastily
dressed as one startled from slumber by the
sudden alarm and surrounded by domestics
some bearing torches others holding naked
swords partizans pistols or such other
weapons as they had caught up in the hurry
 a night alarm betwixt these two parties
stood george douglas his arms folded
on his breast his eyes bent on the ground
like a criminal who knows not how to deny
yet continues unwilling to avow the
guilt in which he has been detected
the abbot 
 speak george douglas said the
lady lochleven speak and clear the
horrid suspicion which rests on thy name
say a douglas was never faithless to his
trust and i am a douglas say this my
dearest son and it is all i ask thee to say
to clear thy name even under such a foul
charge say it was but the wile these
unhappy women and this false boy which
plotted an escape so fatal to scotland so
destructive to thy father's house
 madam said old dryfesdale the steward
 this much do i say for this silly page
that he could not be accessary to unlocking
the doors since i myself this night bolted
him out the castle whoever limned
this nightpiece the lad's share in it seems
to have been small
thou lies dryfesdale said the lady
and wouldst throw the blame on thy master's
house to save the worthless life a
gipsey boy
his death were more desirable to me
vol iii e
 the abbot
than his life answered the steward sullenly
 but the truth is the truth
at these words douglas raised his head
drew up his figure to its full height and
spoke boldly and sedately as one whose resolution
was taken let no life be endangered
for me i alone
douglas said the queen interrupting
him art thou mad speak not i
charge you
 madam he replied bowing with the
deepest respect gladly would i obey your
commands but they must have a victim
and let it be the true one yes madam he
continued addressing the lady lochleven
 i alone am guilty in this matter if
the word a douglas has yet any weight
with you believe me that this boy is innocent
 and on your conscience i charge you
do him no wrong nor let the queen suffer
hardship for embracing the opportunity 
freedom which sincere loyalty which a
sentiment yet deeper offered to her acceptance
yes i had planned the escape
the abbot 
 the most beautiful the most persecuted
 women and far from regretting that i
for a while deceived the malice her enemies
i glory in it and am most willing to
yield up life itself in her cause
 now may god have comfort on my
age said the lady lochleven and
enable me to bear this load affliction o
princess born in a luckless hour when will
you cease to be the instrument seduction
and ruin to all who approach you 
o ancient house lochleven famed so
long for birth and honour evil was the hour
brought the deceiver under thy roof
 say not so madam replied her grandson
 the old honours the douglas line
will be outshone when one its descendants
dies for the most injured queens 
for the most lovely women
douglas said the queen must i at
this moment ay even at this moment
when i may lose a faithful subject for ever
chide thee for forgetting what is due to roe
as thy queen 
loo the abbot
wretched boy said the distracted
lady lochleven hast thou fallen even
thus far into the snare this moabitish
woman hast thou bartered thy name thy
allegiance thy knightly oath thy duty to
thy parents thy country and thy god fora
feigned tear or a sickly smile from lips
which flattered the infirm francis lured to
death the idiot darnley read luscious poetry
with the minion chastest mingled in
the lays love which were sung by the
beggar rizzio and which were joined in
rapture to those the foul and licentious
bothwell 
 blaspheme not madam said douglas 
nor you fair queen and virtuous as fair
chide at this moment the presumption 
thy vassal think not that the mere devotion
 a subject could have moved me to
the part i have been performing well you
deserve that each your lieges should die
for you but i have done more have done
that to which love alone could compel a
douglas i have dissembled farewell then
the abbot 
queen all hearts and empress that 
douglas when you are freed from this
vile bondage as freed you shall be if justice
remains in heaven and when you load
with honours and titles the happy man who
shall deliver you cast one thought on him
whose heart would have despised every reward
for a kiss your hand cast one
thought on his fidelity and drop one tear
on his grave and throwing himself at her
feet he seized her hand and pressed it to
his lips
this before my face said the lady 
lochlevenvwilt thou court thy adulterous
paramour before the eyes a parent tear
them asunder and put him under strict
ward seize him upon your lives she added
seeing that her attendants looked on
each other with hesitation
 they are doubtful said mary save
thyself douglas i command thee 
he started up from the floor and only
exclaiming my life or death are yours
 the abbot
and at your disposal drew his sword
and broke through those who stood betwixt
him and the door the enthusiasm his
onset was too sudden and too lively to have
been opposed by any thing short the
most decided opposition and as he was
both loved and feared by his father's vassals
none them would offer him actual injury
the lady lochleven stood astonished
at his sudden escape am i surrounded
she said by traitors upon him villains
pursue stab cut him down 
he cannot leave the island madam
said dryfesdale interfering i have the
key the boatchain
but two or three voices those who
pursued from curiosity or command their
mistress exclaimed from below that he had
cast himself into the lake
 brave douglas still exclaimed the
queen o true and noble heart that
prefers death to imprisonment 
 fire upon him said the lady lochthe
abbot 
leven if there be here a true servant 
his father let him shoot the runagate dead
and let the lake cover our shame 
the report a gun or two were heard
but they were probably shot rather to obey
the lady than with any purpose hitting
the mark and randal immediately entering
said that master george had been
taken up by a boat from the castle which
lay at a little distance
man a barge and pursue them said
the lady
 it were quite vain said randal by
this time they are half way to shore and a
cloud has come over the moon
 and has the traitor then escaped 
said the lady pressing her hands against
her forehead with a gesture despair 
the honour our house is for ever gone
and all will be deemed accomplices in this
base treachery
 lady lochleven said mary advancing
towards her you have this night cutoff
my fairest hopes you have turned my
 the abbot
expected freedom into bondage and dashed
away the cup joy in the very instant
i was advancing it to my lips and yet i
feel for your sorrow the pity that you deny
to mine gladly would i comfort you
if i might but as i may not i would at
least part from you in charity
 away proud woman said the lady 
 who ever knew so well as thou to deal
the deepest wounds under the pretence 
kindness and courtesy who since the
great traitor could ever so betray with a
kiss
lady douglas lochleven said the
queen in this moment thou canst not
offend me no not even by thy coarse
and unwomanly language held to me in
the presence menials and armed retainers
i have this night owed so much to
one member the house lochleven as
to cancel whatever its mistress can do or
say in the wildness her passion
we are bounden to you princess said
lady lochleven putting a strong constraint
the abbot 
on herself and passing from her tone violence
to that bitter irony ourpoorhouse
hath been but seldom graced with royal
smiles and will hardly with my choice exchange
their rough honesty for such courthonour
as mary scotland has now to
bestow
 they replied mary who knew so
well how to take may think themselves excused
from the obligation implied in receiving
and that i have now little to offer is
the fault the douglasseses and their allies
fear nothing madam replied the lady
 lochleven in the same bitter tone
 you retain an exchequer which neither
your own prodigality can drain nor your
offended country deprive you while you
have fair words and delusive smiles at command
you need no other bribes to lure
youth to folly
the queen cast a not ungratified glance
on a large mirror which hanging on one
side the apartment and illuminated by
the torchlight reflected her beautiful face
e 
 the abbot
and person our hostess grows complaisant
she said my fleming we had not
thought that grief and captivity had left us
so well stored with that sort wealth which
ladies prize most dearly
 your grace will drive this severe woman
frantic said fleming in a low tone
 on my knees i implore you to remember
she is already dreadfully offended and that
we are in her power
i will not spare her fleming answered
the queen it is against my nature
she returned my honest sympathy with insult
and abuse and i will gall her in return
if her words are too blunt for answer let
her use her poniard if she dare
the lady lochleven said the lady
fleming aloud would surely do well now
to withdraw and to leave her grace to repose

 ay replied the lady or to leave her
grace and her grace's minions to think
what silly fly they may next wrap their
meshes about my eldest son is a widower
the abbot 
were he not more worthy the flattering
hopes with which you have seduced his brother
 true the yoke marriage has been
already thrice fitted on but the church 
rome calls it a sacrament and its votaries
may deem it one in which they cannot too
often participate
 and the votaries the church geneva
replied mary colouring with indignation
 as they deem marriage no sacrament
are said at times to dispense with the
holy ceremony then as if afraid the
consequences this home allusion to the
errors lady lochleven's early life the
queen added come my fleming we
grace her too much by this altercation we
will to our sleeping apartment if she would
disturb us again tonight she must cause
the door to be forced so saying she retired
to her bedroom followed by her two
women
lady lochleven stunned as it were by
this last sarcasm and not the less deeply
incensed that she had drawn it upon heros
the abbot
self remained like a statue on the spatwhich
she had occupied when she received an
affront so flagrant dryfesdale and randal
endeavoured to rouse her to recollection
by questions
 what is your honourable ladyship's
pleasure in the premises 
shall we not double the sentinels and
place one upon the boats and another in
the garden said randal
 would you that dispatches were sent
to sir william at edinburgh to acquaint
him with what has happened demanded
dryfesdale and ought not the place 
kinross to be alarmed lest there be force
upon the shores the lake 
do all as thou wilt said the lady collecting
herself and about to depart thou
hast the name a good soldier dryfesdale
take all precautions sacred heaven that
i should be thus openly upbraided 
 would it be your pleasure said clydesdale
hesitating that this person this
lady be more severely restrained 
the abbot 
 no vassal answered the lady indignantly
 my revenge stoops not to such a
low gratification but i will have more
worthy vengeance or the tomb my ancestors
shall cover my shame
and you shall have it madam replied
dryfesdale ere two suns go down you
shall term yourself amply revenged
the lady made no answer perhaps did
not hear his words as she presently left the
apartment by the command dryfesdale
the rest the attendants were dismissed
some to do the duty guard others to
their repose the steward himself remained
after they had all departed and roland
grseme who was alone in the apartment
was surprised to see the old soldier advance
towards him with an air greater cordiality
than he had ever before assumed towards
him but which sat ill on his scowling features

 youth he said i have done thee
some wrong it is thine own fault for thy
behaviour hath seemed as light to me as
 the abbot
the feather thou dearest in thy hat and
surely thy fantastic apparel and idle humour
 mirth and folly have made me
construe thee something harshly but i
saw this night from my casement as i
looked out to see how thou hadst disposed
 thyself in the garden i saw i say the
true efforts which thou didst make to detain
the companion the perfidy him
who is no longer worthy to be called by
his father's name but must be cut oft from
his house like a rotten branch i was just
about to come to thy assistance when the
pistol went oft and the warder a false
knave whom i suspect to be bribed for the
nonce saw himself forced to give the alarm
which perchance till then he had wilfully
withheld to atone therefore for my injustice
towards you i would willingly render
you a courtesy if you would accept 
it from my hands
 may i first crave to know what it is
replied the page
simply to carry the news this discothe
abbot ill
very to holyrood where thou mayest do
thyself much grace as well with the earl
 morton and the regent himself as with
sir william douglas seeing thou hast seen
the matter from to and borne faithful
part therein the making thine own
fortune will be thus lodged in thine own
hand when i trust thou wilt estrange thyself
from foolish vanities and learn to walk
in this world as one who thinks upon the
next
 sir steward said roland graeme i
thank you for your courtesy but i may not
do your errand i pass that i am the
queen's sworn servant and may not be 
counsel against her but setting this apart
methinks it were a bad road to sir william
 lochleven's favour to be the first to tell
him his son's defection neither would
the regent be over well pleased to hear the
infidelity his vassal nor morton to learn
the falsehood his kinsman
um said the steward making that
inarticulate sound which expresses surprise
 the abbot
mingled with displeasure nay then even
fly where ye list for giddypated as ye maybe
you know how to bear you in the world
 i will shew you my system is less selfish
than ye think for said the page for
i hold truth and mirth to be better than
gravity and cunning ay and in the 
to be a match for them you never loved
me less sir steward than you do at this
moment i know you will give me no real
confidence and i am resolved to accept no
false protestations as current coin resume
your old course suspect me as much and
watch me as close as you will i bid you
defiance you have met with your match
 by heaven young man said the steward
with a look bitter malignity if
thou dearest to attempt any treachery towards
the house lochleven thy head
shall blacken in the sun from the warder's
turret i
 he cannot commit treachery who refuses
trust said the page and for my
head it stands as securely on mine own
the abbot 
shoulders as on any turret that ever mason
built
farewell thou prating and speckled
pie said dryfesdale that art so vain 
thine idle tongue and variegated coat beware
trap and limetwig
 and fare thee well thou hoarse old raven
answered the page thy solemn
flight sable hue and deep croak are no
charms against birdbolt or hailshot and
that thou mayest find it is open war betwixt
us each for the cause our mistress
and god shew the right 
amen and defend his own people 
said the steward i will let my mistress
know what addition thou hast made to this
mess traitors good night monsieur
featherpate
 good night seignior sowersby replied
the page and when the old man departed
he betook himself to rest
 the abbot
chapter v
poison'd ill fare dead forsooth cast off
king john
howsoever weary roland graeme might
be the castle lochleven however
much he might wish that the plan for mary's
escape had been perfected i question
if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings
than on the morning after george douglas's
plan for accomplishing her deliverance
had been frustrated in the first place
he had the clearest conviction that he had
misunderstood the inuendo the abbot
and that the affections douglas were fixed
not on catherine seyton but on the
queen and in the second place from the
sort explanation which had taken place bethe
abbot 
twixt the steward and him he felt himself
at liberty without any breach honour towards
the family lochleven to contribute
his best aid to any scheme which should
in future be formed for the queen's escape 
and independently the good will which
he himself had to the enterprize he knew
he could find no surer road to the favour 
catherine seyton he now sought but an
opportunity to inform her that he had dedicated
himself to this task and fortune was
propitious in affording him one which was
unusually favourable
at the ordinary hour breakfast it was
introduced by the steward with the usual
forms who as soon as it was placed on the
board in the inner apartment said to roland
graeme with a glance sarcastic import
 i leave you my young sir to do
the office sewer it has been too long
rendered to the lady mary by one belonging
to the house douglas
 were it the prime and principal who
 the abbot
ever bore the name said roland the office
were an honour to him
the steward departed without replying to
this bravade otherwise than by a dark look
 scorn graeme thus left alone busied
himself as one engaged in a labour love
to imitate as well as he could the grace
and courtesy with which george douglas
was wont to render his ceremonial service
at meals to the queen scotland
there was more than youthful vanity 
there was a generous devotion in the feeling
with which he took up the task as a brave
soldier assumes the place a comrade who
has fallen in the front battle i am
now he said their only champion and
come weal come woe i will be to the best
 my skill and power as faithful as trustworthy
as brave as any douglas them
all could have been
at this moment catherine seyton entered
alone contrary to her custom and
not less contrary to her custom she enterthe
abbot 
ed with her kerchief at her eyes roland
graeme approached her with beating heart
and with downcast eyes and asked her in a
low and hesitating voiccjwhether the queen
were well 
can you suppose it said catherine 
 think you her heart and body are framed
 steel and iron to endure the cruel disappointment
 yester even and the infamous
taunts yonder puritanic hag 
would to god that i were a man to aid
her more effectually 
 if those who carry pistols and batons
and poniards said the page are not men
they are at least amazons and that is as formidable

 you are welcome to the flash your
wit sir replied the damsel i am neither
in spirits to enjoy or to reply to it
 well then said the page list to mein
all serious truth and first let me say
that the gear last night had been smoother
had you taken me into your counsels
 and so we meant but who could have
 the abbot
guessed that master page should chuse to
pass all night in the garden like some moonstricken
knight in a spanish romance instead
 being in his bedroom when douglas
came to hold communication with him
on our project 
 and why said the page defer to so
late a moment so important a confidence 
because your communications with
henderson and with pardon the natural
impetuosity and fickleness your disposition
made us dread to entrust you with a
secret such consequence till the last moment

 and why at the last moment said the
page offended at this frank avowal why
at that or any other moment since i had
the misfortune to incur so much suspicion

nay now you are angry again said
catherine and to serve you aright i
should break off this talk but i will be
magnanimous and answer your question
know then our reason for trusting you was
the abbot 
twofold in the first place we could scarce
avoid it since you slept in the room through
which we had to pass in the second
place
 nay said the page you may dispense
with a second reason when the first
makes your confidence in me a case necessity

good now hold thy peace said catherine
 in the second place as i said before
there is one foolish person among us
who believes that roland graeme's heart is
warm though his head is giddy that his
blood is pure though it boils too hastilyand
that his faith and honour are true as
the loadstar though his tongue sometimes
is far less than discreet
this avowal catherine repeated in a low
tone with her eyes fixed on the floor as if
she shunned the glance roland while
she suffered it to escape her lips and
this single friend exclaimed the youth in
rapture this only one who would do 
the abbot
time to the poor roland graeme and whose
own generous heart taught her to distinguish
between follies the brain and faults
 the heart will you not tell me dearest
catherine to whom i owe my most
grateful my most heartfelt thanks 
 nay said catherine with her eyes still
fixed on the ground if your own heart
tell you not
 dearest catherine said the page seizing
upon her hand and kneeling on one
knee
if your own heart i say tell you not
said catherine gently disengaging her hand
it is very ungrateful for since the maternal
kindness the lady fleming
the page started on his feet by heaven
catherine your tongue wears as many
disguises as your person but you only
mock me cruel girl you know the lady
fleming has no more regard for any one
than hath the forlorn princess who is wrought
into yonder piece old figured courttapestry

the abbot 
it may be so said catherine seyton
but you should not speak so loud
 pshaw answered the page but at the
same time lowering his voice she cares
for no one but herself and the queen and
you know besides there is no one you
whose opinion i value if i have not your
own no not that queen mary herself

 the more shame for you if it be so
said catherine with great composure
nay but fair catherine said the page
why will you thus damp my ardour when
i am devoting myself body and soul to the
cause your mistress 
 it is because in doing so said catherine
 you debase a cause so noble by naming
along with it any baser or more selfish
motive believe me she said with kindling
eyes and while the blood mantled on
her cheek they think vilely and falsely
 women i mean those who deserve
the name who deem that they love the
vol iii f
 the abbot
gratification their vanity or the mean
purpose engrossing a lover's admiration
and affection better than they love the virtue
and honour the man they may be
brought to prefer he that serves his religion
his prince and his country with ardour
and devotion need not plead his cause
with the commonplace rant romantic
passion the woman whom he honours with
his love becomes his debtor and her corresponding
affection is engaged to repay his
glorious toil
 you hold a glorious prize for such
toil said the youth bending his eyes on
her with enthusiasm
only a heart which knows how to value
it said catherine he that should
free this injured princess from these dungeons
and set her at freedom among her
free and warlike nobles whose hearts are
burning to welcome her where is the maiden
in scotland whdife the ove such a
hero would not honour were she sprung
from the blood royal the land and he
the abbot 
the offspring the poorest cottager that
ever held a plough 
i am determined said roland to
take the adventure tell me first however
fair catherine and speak it as if you were
confessing to the priest this poor queen
i know she is unhappy but catherine do
you hold her innocent she is accused 
murder
 do i hold the lamb guilty because it
is assailed by the wolf answered catherine
 do i hold yonder sun polluted because
an earthdamp sullies his beams 
the page sighed and looked down
would my conviction were as deep as
thine but one thing is clear that in this
captivity she hath wrong she rendered
herself up on a capitulation and the terms
have been refused her i will embrace her
quarrel to the death
 will you will you indeed said catherine
taking his hand in her turn o
be but firm in mind as thou art bold indeed
and quick in resolution j keep but
 the abbot
thy plighted faith and after ages shall honour
thee as the saviour scotland
 but when i have toiled successfully to
win that leah honour thou wilt not my
catherine said the page condemn me
to a new term service for that rachel
love 
 that said catherine again extricating
her hand from his grasp we shall
have full time to speak but honour is the
elder sister and must be won the first
i may not win her answered the page 
 but i will venture fairly for her and man
can do no more and know fair catherine
for you shall see the very secret thought
 my heart that not honour only not
only that other and fairer sister whom you
frown on me for so much as mentioning 
but the stern commands duty also compel
me to aid the queen's deliverance
indeed said catherine you were
wont to have doubts on that matter
 ay but her life was not then threatened
replied roland
the abbot 
and is it now more endangered than
heretofore asked catherine seyton in
anxious terror
 be not alarmed said the page but
you heard the terms on which your royal
mistress parted with the lady lochleven

 too well but too well said catherine
 alas that she cannot rule her
princely resentment and refrain from encounters
like these 
that hath passed betwixt them said
roland for which woman never forgives
woman i saw the lady's brow turn pale
and then black when before all the menzies
and in her moment power the
queen humbled her to the dust by taxing
her with her shame and i heard the oath
 deadly resentment and revenge which
she muttered in the ear one who by his
answer will i judge be but too ready an
executioner her will
 you terrify me said catherine
 the abbot
 do not so take it call up the masculine
part your spirit we will counteract
and defeat her plans be they dangerous
as they may why do you look upon me
thus and weep 
 alas said catherine because you
stand there before me a living and breathing
man in all the adventurous glow and
enterprize youth yet still possessing the
frolic spirits childhood there you stand
full alike generous enterprize and childish
recklessness and if today tomorrow
or some such brief space you lie a mangled
and lifeless corpse upon the floor these
hateful dungeons who but catherine seyton
will be the cause your brave and
gay career being broken short as you start
from the goal alas she whom you have
chosen to twine your wreath may too probably
have to work your shroud
 and be it so catherine said the page
in the full glow youthful enthusiasm 
 and do thou vork my shroud and if thou
the abbot 
grace it with such tears as fall now at the
thought it will honour my remains more
than an earl's mantle would my living body
but shame on this faintness heart the
time craves a firmer mood be a woman
catherine or rather be a man thou canst
be a man if thou wilt
catherine dried her tears and endeavoured
to smile
 you must not ask me she said about
that which so much disturbs your mind j
you shall know all in time nay you should
know all now but that hush here comes
the queen
mary entered from her apartment paler
than usual and apparently exhausted by a
sleepless night and by the painful thoughts
which had ill supplied the place repose j
yet the languor her looks was so far front
impairing her beauty that it only substituted
the frail delicacy the lovely woman
for the majestic grace the queen contrary
to her wont her toilette had been very
hastily dispatched and her hair which was
 the abbot
usually dressed by lady fleming with great
care escaping from beneath the headtire
which had been hastily adjusted fell in long
and luxuriant tresses nature's own curling
over a neck and bosom which were
somewhat less carefully veiled than usual
as she stepped over the threshold her
apartment catherine hastily drying her
tears ran to meet her royal mistress and
having first kneeled at her feet and kissed
her hand instantly rose and placing herself
on the other side the queen seemed
anxious to divide with the lady fleming
the honour supporting and assisting her
the page on his part advanced and put in
order the chair state which she usually
occupied and having placed the cushion
and footstool for her accommodation stepped
back and stood ready for service in
the place usually occupied by his predecessor
the young seneschal mary's eye
rested an instant on him and could not
but remark the change persons her's
was not the female heart which could rethe
abbot 
fuse compassion at least to a gallant youth
who had suffered in her cause although he
had been guided in his enterprize by a too
presumptuous passion and the words poor
douglas escaped from her lips perhaps
unconsciously as she leant herself back in
her chair and put the kerchief to her eyes
yes gracious madam said catherine
assuming a cheerful manner in order to
cheer her sovereign our gallant knight
is indeed banished the adventure was not
reserved for him but he has left behind him
a youthful esquire as much devoted to your
grace's service and who by me makes you
tender his hand and sword
if they may in aught avail your grace
said roland grasme bowing profoundly
 alas said the queen what needs
this catherine why prepare new victims
to be involved in and overwhelmed by my
cruel fortune were we not better cease to
struggle and ourselves sink in the tide without
further resistance than thus drag into
destruction with us every generous heart
f 
 the abbot
which makes an effort in our favour i
have had but too much plot and intrigue
around me since i was stretched an orphan
child in my very cradle while contending
nobles strove which should rule
in the name the unconscious innocent
surely time it were that all this busy and
most dangerous coil should let me
call my prison a convent and my seclusion
a voluntary sequestration myself from
the world and its ways
speak not thus madam before your
faithful servants said catherine to discourage
their zeal at once and to break
their hearts daughter kings be not in
this hour so unkingly come roland and
let us the youngest her followers shew
ourselves worthy her cause let us kneel
before her footstool and implore her to be
her own magnanimous self and leading
roland graeme to the queen's seat they
both kneeled down before her mary raised
herself in her chair and sat erect while
extending one hand to be kissed by the
the abbot
tn
page she arranged with the other the clustering
locks which shaded the bold yet
lovely bro w the highspirited catherine
s she often called her young attendant
 that you should thus desperately
mix with my unhappy fate the fortune 
your own young lives l are they not a lovely
couple my fleming and is it not heartrending
co think that i must be their ruin 
 not so said roland greene it is
we gracious sovereign who will be your
deliverers
 tex oritur parvulorump said the queen
looking upward if it is by the mouth 
these children that heaven calls me to resume
the stately thoughts which become
my birth and my rights thou wilt grant
them thy protection and to me the power
 rewarding their zeal then turning to
fleming she instantly added thou
knowest my friend whether to make those
who have served me happy was not ever
mary's favourite pastime when i have
 the abbot
been rebuked by the stern preachers the
calvinistic heresy when i have seen the
fierce countenances my nobles averted
from me has it not been because i mixed
in the harmless pleasures the young and
gay and rather for the sake their happiness
than my own have mingled in the
masque the song or the dance with the
youth my household well i repent
not it though knox termed it sin and
morton degradation i was happy because
i saw happiness around me and woe betide
the wretched jealousy that can extract guilt
out the overflowing an unguarded
gaiety fleming if we are restored to our
throne shall we not have one blithesome
day at a blithesome bridal which we must
now name neither the bride nor the bridegroom
 but that bridegroom shall have the
barony blairgowrie a fair gift even fora
queen to give and that bride's chaplet
shall be twined with the fairest pearls that
ever were found in the depths lochlomond
j and thou thyself mary fleming
the abbot 
the best dresser tires that ever busked the
tresses a queen and who would scorn to
touch those any woman lower rank
thou thyself shalt for my love twine them
into the bride's tresses look my fleming
suppose them such clustered locks
as those our catherine they would not
put shame upon thy skill
so saying she passed her hand fondly
over the head her youthful favourite
while her more aged attendant replied despondently
 alas madam your thoughts
stray far from home
 they do my fleming said the queen
 but is it well or kind in you to call them
back god knows they have kept theperch
this night but too closely come i will recal
the gay vision were it but to punish
them yes at that bhthesome bridal mary
herself shall forget the weight sorrows
and the toil state and herself once
more lead a measure at whose wedding
was it that we last danced my fleming
 think care has troubled my 
the abbot
more yet something it i should remember
 canst thou not aid me i know thou
canst
alas madam replied the lady 
what said mary wilt thou not help
us so far this is a peevish adherence to
thine own graver opinion which holds our
talk as folly but thou art courtbred and
wilt well understand me when i say the
queen commands lady fleming to tell her
where she led the last hranur
with a face deadly pale and a mien as
if she were about to sink into the earth the
courtbred dame no longer daring to refuse
obedience faultered out gracious lady
if my memory err not it was at a masque
in holyrood at the marriage sebastian

the unhappy queen who had hitherto
listened with a melancholy smile provoked
by the reluctance with which the lady
fleming brought out her story at this illfated
word interrupted her with a shriek so
wild and loud that the vaulted apartment
the abbot 
rang and both roland and catherine
sprung to their feet in the utmost terror
and alarm meantime mary seemed by
the train horrible ideas thus suddenly excited
surprised not only beyond selfcommand
but for the moment beyond the
verge reason
traitress she said to the lady fleming
 thou wouldst slay thy sovereign
call my french guards a moi a moi 
mes francis i am beset with traitors in
mine own palace they have murdered my
husband rescue rescue for the queen
 scotland she started up from her
chair her features late so exquisitely lovely
in their paleness now inflamed with the
fury frenzy and resembling those a
bellona we will take the field ourself
she said warn the city warn lothian
and fife saddle our spanish barb and bid
french paris see ouv petronel be charged
better to die at the head our brave
scotsmen like our grandfather at flodden
 the abbot
than a broken heart like our ill starred
father
 be patient be composed dearest sovereign
said catherine and then addressing
lady fleming angrily she added how
could you say aught that reminded her 
her husband 
the word reached the ear the unhappy
princess who caught it up speaking with
great rapidity husband what husband
 not his most christian majesty he
is ill at ease he cannot mount on horseback
 not him the lennox but it was
the puke orkney thou wouldst say
for god's love madam be patient 
said the lady fleming
but the queen's excited imagination could
by no entreaty be diverted from its course
 bid him come hither to our aid she said
 and bring with him his lambs as he calls
them bowton hay tall black armis
ton and his kinsman hob fie how swart
they are and how they smell sulphur
the abbot 
what closeted with morton nay if the
douglas and the hepburn hatch the complot
together the bird when it breaks the
shell will scare scotland will it not ray
fleming 
 she grows wilder and wilder said fleming
 we have too many hearers for these
strange words
 roland said catherine in the name
 god before you cannot aid us here 
leave us to deal with her alone away 
away 
she thrust him to the door the antiroom
 yet even when he had entered that
apartment and shut the door he could still
hear the queen talk in a loud and determined
tone as if giving forth orders until at
length the voice died away in a feeble and
continued lamentation
at this crisis catherine entered the antiroom
 be not too anxious she said the
crisis is now over but keep the door fast
let no one enter until she is more coiu
posed
 the abbot
 in the name god what does this
mean said the page or what was therein
the lady fleming's words to excite so
wild a transport 
o the lady fleming the lady fleming
said catherine repeating the words
impatiently the lady fleming is a fool 
she loves her mistress yet knows so little
how to express her love that were the queen
to ask her for very poison she would deem
it a point duty not to resist her commands
i could have torn her starched headtire
from her formal head the queen
should have as soon had the heart out 
my body as the word sebastian out my
lipsthat that piece weaved tapestry
should be a woman and yet not have wit
enough to tell a lie 
and what was this story sebastian 
said the page by heaven catherine you
are all riddles alike
you are as great a fool as fleming returned
the impatient maiden know ye
not that on the night henry darnley's
the abbot 
murder and at the blowing up the kirk
 field the queen's absence was owing to
her attending on a masque at holyrood
given by her to grace the marriage this
same sebastian who himself a favoured
servant married one her female attendants
who was near to her person 
by saint giles said the page i wonder
not at her passion but only marvel by
what forgetful ness it was that she could
urge the lady fleming with such a question

i cannot account for it said catherine
 but it seems as if great and violent
grief or horror sometimes obscure the memory
and spread a cloud like that an
exploding cannon over the circumstances
with which they are accompanied but i
may not stay here where came not to moralize
with your wisdom but simply to cool
my resentment against that unwise lady
fleming which i think hath now somewhat
abated so that i shall endure her presence
 the abbot
without any desire to damage either her
curch or pasquin meanwhile keep fast
that door would not for my life that any
 these heretics saw her in the unhappy
state which brought on her as it has
been by the success their own diabolical
plotting they would not stick to call in
their snuffling cant the judgment providence

she left the apartment just as the latch
 the outward door was raised from without
but the bolt which roland had drawn
on the inside resisted the efforts the person
desirous to enter who is there 
said graeme aloud
it is i replied the harsh and yet slow
voice the steward dryfesdale
you cannot enter now returned the
youth
 and wherefore demanded clydesdale
 seeing i come but to do my duty
and enquire what mean the shrieks from
the apartments the moabitish lady wherethe
abbot 
fore i say since such is mine errand can
i not enter 
simply replied the youth because
the bolt is drawn and i have no fancy to
undo it i have the right side the door
today as you had last night
thou art illadvised thou malapert
boy replied the steward to speak to mein
such fashion but shall inform my lady
 thine insolence
 the insolence said the page is
meant for thee only in fair guerdon thy
constant discourtesy to me for thy lady's
information i have answer more courteous
you may say that the queen is ill at ease
and desires to be disturbed neither by visits
nor messages
 i conjure you in the name god
said the old man with more solemnity in
his tone than he had hitherto used to let
me know if her malady really gains power
on her 
 she will have no aid at your hand or
at your ladywhereforebegone and 
the abbot
bie us no more we neither want nor will
accept aid at your hands
with this positive reply the steward
grumbling and dissatisfied returned downstairs

it is the curse kings to be attended
by slaves who take their humours for a warrant
to break into the bloody house life
and on the winking authority
to understand a law
kitiff john
the lady lochleven sat alone in her
chamber endeavouring with sincere but
imperfect zeal to fix her eyes and her attention
on the blacklettered bible which
lay before her bound in velvet and embroidery
and adorned with massive silver
clasps and knosps but she found her utmost
efforts unable to withdraw her mind
from the resentful recollection what had
last night passed betwixt her and the queen
in which the latter had with such bitter
taunt reminded her her early and longrepented
transgression
 the abbot
why she said should i resent so deeply
that another reproaches me with that which
have never ceased to make matter blushing
to myself and yet why should this
woman who reaps at least has reaped the
fruits my folly and has jostled my son
aside from the throne why should she in
the face all my domestics and her
own dare to upbraid me with my shame
and folly is she not in my power does
she not fear me ha wily tempter i will
wrestle with thee strongly and with better
suggestions than my own evil heart can
supply
she again took up the sacred volume and
was endeavouring to fix her attention on its
contents when she was disturbed by a tap
at the door the room it opened at her
command and the steward dryfesdale entered
and stood before her with a gloomy
and perturbed expression on his brow
 what has chanced dryfesdale that thou
loosest thus said his mistress have
the abbot 
there been evil tidings my son or mj
grandchildren 
no lady replied dryfesdale but
you were deeply insulted last night and i
fear me thou art as deeply avenged this
morning where is the chaplain 
what mean you by hints so dark and
a question so sudden the chaplain as
you well know is absent at perth upon an
assembly the brethren
i care not answered the steward he
is but a priest baal
dryfesdale said the lady sternly
 what meanest thou i have ever heard
that in the low countries thou didst herd
with the anabaptist preachers those boars
which tear up the vintage but the ministry
which suits me and my house must
content my retainers
i would i had good ghostly counsel
though replied the steward not attending
tohismistres's rebuke and seeming speak
to himself this woman moab 
vol iii g
 the abbot
speak her with reverence said the
lady she is a king's daughter
 ee it so replied dryfesdale she
goes where there is little difference betwixt
her and a beggar's child mary scotland
is dying
dying and in my castle said the lady
starting up in alarm what disease or
by what accident
bear patience lady the ministry was
mme
 thine villain and traitor i how didst
thou dare 
i heard you insulted lady i heard you
demand vengeance i promised it you and
i now bring tidings it
 dryfesdale i trust thou rarest said
the lady
i rave not replied the steward that
which was written me a million years
ere i saw the light must be executed by
me she hath that in her veins that i fear
me will soon stop the springs life
the abbot 
cruel villain exclaimed the lady
 thou hast not poisoned her 
and if i had said dryfesdale what
does it so greatly merit men bane vermin
why not rid them their enemies so 
in italy they will do it for a cruizuedor
cowardly ruffian begone from my
sight 
think better my zeal lady said the
steward and judge not without looking
around you lindsay ruthven and your
kinsman morton poniard rizzio and yet
you now see no blood on their embroidery
the lord semple stabbed the lord 
farquhar does his bonnet sit a jot more
awry on his brow what noble lives in scotland
who has nothad a share for policy or revenge
in some such dealing and who imputes
it to them be not cheated with names
a dagger or a draught work to the same
 and are little unlike a glass phial imprisons
the one and a leathern sheath the
other one deals with the brain the other
 the abbot
sluices the blood yet say not i gave
aught to this lady
 what dost thou mean by thus dallying
with me said the lady as thou wouldst
gave thy neck from the rope it merits tell
me the whole truth this story thou hast
long been known a dangerous man
ay in my master's service i can be
cold and sharp as my sword be it known
to you that when last on shore i consulted
with a woman skill and power called
nicneven whom the country has rung
for this some brief time past fools asked
her for charms to make them beloved misers
for means to increase their store some
demanded to know the future an idle wish
since it cannot be altered others would
have an explanation the past idler still
since it cannot be recalled i heard their
queries with scorn and demanded the means
 avenging myself a deadly enemy for
i grow old and may trust no longer to bilboa
blade she gave me a packet mix
the abbot 
that said she with any liquid and thy vengeance
is complete
 villain and you mixed it with the
food this imprisoned lady to the dishonour
 thy master's house 
 to redeem the insulted honour my
master's house i mixed the contents the
packet with the jar succory water they
seldom fail to drain it and the woman loves
it over all
 it was a work hell said the lady
lochleven both the asking and the granting
 away wretched man let us see if aid
be yet too late 
they will not admit us madam save
we enter by force i have been twice at
the door but can obtain no entrance
 we will beat it level with the ground
if needful and hold summon randal
hither instantly randal here is a foul
and evil chance befallen send off a boat
instantly to kinross the chamberlain luke
lund in is said to have skill fetch too
 the abbot
that foul witch nicneven she shall first
counteract her own spell and then be burned
to ashes in the island saint serf
away away tell them to hoist sail and
ply oar as ever they would have good 
the douglas's hand
 mother nicneven will not be lightly
found or fetched hither on these conditions
answered dryfesdale
 then grant her full assurance safety
 look to it for thine own life must answer
for this lady's recovery
 i might have guessed that said clydesdale
sullenly j but it is my comfort i
have avenged mine own cause as well as
yours she hath scoffed and stripped at
me and encouraged her saucy minion 
a page to ridicule my stiff gait and slow
speech i felt it borne in upon me that i
was to be avenged on them
go to the western turret said the
lady and remain there in ward until we
see how this gear will terminate i know
the abbot 
thy resolved disposition thou wilt not attempt
escape
not were the walls the turret eggshells
and the lake sheeted with ice said
dryfesdale i am well taught and strong
in belief that man does nought himself 
he is but the foam on the billow which
rises bubbles and bursts not by its own
effort but by the mightier impulse fate
which urges him yet lady if i may advise
amid this zeal for the life the jezebel
 scotland forget not what is due to
thine own honour and keep the matter secret
as you may
so saying the gloomy fatalist turned from
her and stalked off vith sullen composure
to the place confinement allotted to him
his lady caught at his last hint and only
expressed her fear that the prisoner had
partaken some unwholesome food and
was dangerously ill the castle was soon
alarmed and in confusion randal was dispatched
to the shore to fetch off lundin
 the abbot
with such remedies as could counteract
poison and with farther instructions to
bring mother nineveh if she could be
found with fall power to pledge the lady
 lochleven's word for her safety
meanwhile the lady lochleven herself
held parley at the door the queen's
apartment and in vain urged the page to
undo it
 foolish boy she said thine own
life and thy lady's are at stake open i
say or we will cause the door to be broken
down
i may not open the door without my
royal mistress's orders answered roland j
she has been very ill and now she 
you wake her by using violence
let the consequence be on you and your
followers
was ever woman in a strait so fearful 
said the lady lochleven at least
thou rash boy beware that no one tastes
the food but especially the jar succorywater

the abbot 
she then hastened to the turret where
dryfesdale had composedly resigned himself
to imprisonment she found him reading
and demanded him was thy fell
potion speedy operation 
slow answered the steward the
hag asked me which i chose i told her i
loved a slow and sure revenge revenge
said i is the highestflavoured draught
which man tastes upon earth and he should
sip it by little and little not drain it up
greedily at once
 against whom unhappy man couldst
thou nourish so fell a revenge 
 i had many objects but the chief was
that insolent page
 the boy thou inhuman man exclaimed
the lady what could he do to
deserve thy malice 
 he rose in your favour and you graced
him with your commissions that was
one thing he rose in that george douglas's
also that was another he was the
g 
 the abbot
favourite the calvinistic henderson who
hated me because my spirit disowns a separated
priesthood the moabitish queen
held him dear winds from each opposing
point blew in his favour the old servitor
 your house was held lightly among ye 
above all from the first time i saw his face
i longed to destroy him
 what fiend have i nurtured in my
house replied the lady may god forgive
me the sin having given thee food
and raiment 
you might not chuse lady answered
the steward long ere this castle was
builded ay long ere the islet which sustains
it reared its head above the blue water
i was destined to be your faithful slave
and you to be my ungrateful mistress remember
you not when i plunged amid the
victorious french in the time this lady's
mother and brought offyour husband when
those who had hung at the same breasts
with him dared not attempt the rescue 
the abbot 
remember how i plunged into the lake
when your grandson's skiff was overtaken
by the tempest boarded and steered her
safe to the land lady the servant a
scottish baron is he who regards not his
own life or that any other save his master
and for the death the woman i
had tried the potion on her sooner had not
master george been her taster her death
would it not be the happiest news that
scotland ever heard is she not the
bloody russian stock whose sword was so
often red with the blood gods saints 
is she not the daughter the wretched tyrant
james whom heaven cast down from
his kingdom and his pride even as the king
 babylon was smitten 
peace villain said the lady a thousand
varied recollections thronging on her
mind at the mention her royal lover's
name peace and disturb not the ashes
 the dead the royal the unhappy
dead read thy bible and may god grant
thee to avail thyself better its contents
 the abbot
than thou hast yet done she departed
hastily and as she reached the next apartment
the tears rose to her eyes so hastily
that she was compelled to stop and use her
kerchief to dry them i expected not this
she said no more than to have drawn water
from the dry flint or sap from a withered
tree i saw with a dry eye the apostacy
and shame george douglas the hope 
my son's house the child my love j and
yet i now weep for him who has so long
lain in his grave for him to whom i owe
it that his daughter can make a scoffing ancf
a jest my name but she is ms daughter
my heart hardened against her for so
many causes relents when a glance her
eye places her father unexpectedly before
me and as often her likeness to that true
daughter the house guise her detested
mother has again confirmed my resolution
but she must not must not die in my
house and by so foul a practice thank
god the operation the potion is slow
and may be counteracted i will to her
the abbot 
apartment once more but o that hardened
villain whose fidelity we held in such
esteem and had such high proof what
miracle can unite so much wickedness and
so much truth in one bosom 
the lady lochleven was not aware
how far minds a certain gloomy and determined
cast by nature may be warped by
a keen sense petty injuries and insult
combining with the love gain and sense
 selfinterest and amalgamated with the
crude wild and undigested fanatical opinions
which this man had gathered among
the crazy sectaries germany or how far
the doctrines fatalism which he had embraced
so decidedly sear the human conscience
by representing our actions as the
result inevitable necessity
during her visit to the prisoner roland
had communicated to catherine the tenor
 the conversation he had had with her at
the door the apartment the quick intelligence
 that lively maiden instantly
comprehended the outline what was bets
the abbot
lived to have happened but her prejudices
hurried her beyond the truth
they meant to have poisoned us she
exclaimed in horror and there stands the
fatal liquor which should have done the
deed ay as soon as douglas ceased to be
our taster our food was like to be fatally
seasoned thou roland who shouldst have
made the essay wert readily doomed to die
with us o dearest lady fleming pardon
pardon for the injuries i said to you
in my anger your words were prompted
by heaven to save our lives and especially
that the injured queen but what have
we now to do that old crocodile the
lake will be presently back to shed her hypocritical
tears over our dying agonies 
lady fleming what shall we do 
our lady help us in our need i she
replied how should i tell unless we
were to make our plaint to the regent
make our plaint to the devil said catherine
impatiently and accuse his dam
at the foot his burning throne the queen
the abbot 
still sleeps we must gain time the poisoning
hag must not know her scheme has
miscarried the old envenomed spider has
but too many ways mending her broken
web the jar succory water said she
roland if thou best a man help me 
empty the jar on the chimney or from the
window make such waste among the viands
as if we had made our usual meal and
leave the fragments on cup and porringer
but taste nothing as thou lowest thy life i
will sit by the queen and tell her at her
waking in what a fearful pass we stand
her sharp wit and ready spirit will teach
us what is best to be done meanwhile till
farther notice observe roland that the
queen is in a state torpor that lady
fleming is indisposed that character
speaking in a lower tone will suit her best
and save her wits some labour in vain i
am not so much indisposed thou understands

and i said the page
 the abbot
 you replied catherine you are
quite well who thinks it worth while to
poison puppydogs or pages
 does this levity become the time 
said the page
 it does it does answered catherine
seyton if the queen approves i see
plainly how this disconcerted attempt may
do us good service
she went to work while she spoke eagerly
assisted by roland the breakfast table
soon displayed the appearance as if the ladies
had eaten their meal as usual and the
ladies retired as softly as possible into the
queen's sleeping apartment at a new
summons the lady lochleven the page
undid the door and admitted her into the
antiroom asking her pardon for having
withstood her alleging in excuse that the
queen had fallen into a heavy slumber since
she had broken her fast
she has eaten and drunken then said
the lady lochleven
the abbot ll
surely replied the page according to
her grace's ordinary custom unless upon
the fasts the church
the jar she said hastily examining
it it is empty drank the lady mary the
whole this water 
a large part madam and i heard the
lady catherine seyton jestingly upbraid
the lady mary fleming with having taken
more than a just share what remained
so that but little fell to her own lot
and are they well in health said the
lady lochleven
lady fleming said the page complains
 lethargy and looks duller than
usual and the lady catherine seyton
feels her head somewhat more giddy than
is her wont
he raised his voice a little as he said
these words to apprize the ladies the
part assigned to each them and not perhaps
without the wish conveying to the
ears catherine the pagelike jest which
lurked in the allotment
 the abbot
 i will enter the queen's chamber said
the lady lochleven my business is express

as she advanced to the door the voice
 catherine seyton was heard from within
 no one can enter here the queen
sleeps
 i will not be controuled young lady
replied the lady lochleven there is
i wot no inner bar and i will enter in
your despite
 there is indeed no inner bar answered
catherine firmly but there are the
staples where that bar should be and into
those staples have i thrust mine arm like
an ancestress your own when better
employed than the douglasseses our days
she thus defended the bedchamber her
sovereign against murderers try your
force then and see whether a seyton cannot
rival in courage a maiden the house
 douglas
i dare not attempt the pass at such
risk said the lady lochleven strange
the abbot 
that this princess with all that justly attaches
to her as blameworthy should preserve
such empire over the minds her
attendants damsel i give thee my honour
that i come for the queen's safety
and advantage awaken her if thou lowest
her and pray her leave that i may enter
i will retire from the door the whilst
 thou wilt not awaken the queen
said the lady fleming
 what choice have we said the readywitted
maiden unless you deem it better
to wait till the lady lochleven herself plays
lady the bedchamber her fit patience
will not last long and the queen
must be prepared to meet her
but thou wilt bring back her grace's
fit by thus disturbing her
 heaven forbid i replied catherine j
but if so it must pass for an effect the
poison hope better things and that the
queen will be able when she wakes to form
her own judgment in this terrible crisis
meanwhile do thou dear lady fleming
 the abbot
practise to look as dull and heavy as the
alertness thy spirit will permit
catherine kneeled by the side the
queen's bed and kissing her hand repeatedly
succeeded at last in awakening without
alarming her she seemed surprised to find
that she was ready dressed but sate up in
her bed and appeared so perfectly composed
that catherine seyton without farther
preamble judged it safe to inform her 
the predicament in which they were placed
mary turned pale and crossed herself again
and again when she heard the imminent
danger in which she had stood but like
the ulysses horner
hardly waking yet
sprung in her mind the momentary wit
and she at once understood her situation
with the dangers and advantages that attended
it
 we cannot do better she said after
her hasty conference with catherine press
the abbot lacing
her at the same time to her bosom and
kissing her forehead we cannot do better
than to follow the scheme so happily
devised by thy quick wit and bold affection
undo the door to the lady lochleven 
she shall meet her match in art though not
in perfidy fleming draw close the curtain
and get thee behind it thou art a
better tirewoman than an actress but do
but breathe heavily and if thou wilt groan
slightly and it will top thy part hark 
they come now catherine medicis
may thy spirit inspire me for a cold northern
brain is too blunt for this scene 
ushered by catherine seyton and stepping
as light as she could the lady lochleven
was ushered into the twilight apartment
and conducted to the side the
couch where mary pallid and exhausted
from a sleepless night and the subsequent
agitation the morning lay extended so
listlessly as might well confirm the worst
fears her hostess
 the abbot
now god forgive us our sins said
the lady lochleven forgettingherpride
and throwing herself on her knees by the
side the bed it is too true she is
murdered
 who is in the chamber said mary
as if awaking from a heavy sleep j seyton
fleming where are you i heard a strange
voice who waits call ourselves
alas her memory is at holyrood
though her body is at lochleven forgive
madam continued the lady if i
call your attention to me i am margaret
erskine the house mar by marriage
lady douglas lochleven
 o our gentle hostess answered the
queen who hath such care our lodgings
and our diet we cumber you too
much and too long good lady lochleven
 but we now trust your task hospitality
is well nigh ended
her words go like a knife through my
heart said the lady lochleven with
the abbot 
a breaking heart i pray your grace to tell
me what is your ailment that aid may be
had if there be yet time 
 nay my ailment replied the queen
is nothing nothing worth telling or
worth a leech's notice my limbs feel heavy
my heart feels cold a prisoner's limbs
and heart are rarely otherwise fresh air
methinks and freedom would soon revive
me but as the estates have ordered it
death alone can break my prisondoors
 were it possible madam said the lady
 that your liberty could restore your
perfect health i would myself encounter
the resentment the regent my son
sir william my whole friends rather
than you should meet your fate in this
castle
 alas madam said the lady fleming
who conceived the time propitious to shew
that her own address had been held too
lightly it is but trying what good freedom
may work upon us for myself i think
 the abbot
a free walk on the greensward would dome
much good at heart
the lady lochleven rose from the
bedside and darted a penetrating look at
the elder valetudinary are you so evildisposed
lady fleming
evildisposed indeed madam replied
the court dame and more especially since
breakfast
 help help exclaimed catherine
anxious to break off a conversation which
boded her schemes no good help i
say help the queen is about to pass away
aid her lady lochleven if you be a woman

the lady hastened to support the queen's
head who turning her eyes towards her
with an air great languor exclaimed
thanks my dearest lady lochleven 
notwithstanding some passages late i
have never misconstrued or misdoubt
your affection to our house it was proved
as i have heard before i was born
the abbot g
the lady lochleven sprung from the
floor on which she had again knelt and having
paced the apartment in great disorder
flung open the lattice as if to get air
 now our lady forgive me said catherine
to herself how deep must the
love sarcasm be implanted in the breasts
 us women since the queen with all her
sense will risk ruin rather than rein in her
wit she then adventured stooping over
the queen's person to press her arm with
her hand saying at the same time for
god's sake madam restrain yourself
thou art too forward maiden said
the queen but immediately added in a
low whisper forgive me catherine but
when i felt the hag's murderous handsbusy
about my head and neck i felt such disgust
and hatred that i must have said something
or died but i will be schooled to better
saviour only see that thou let her not
touch me
 now god be praised said the lady
vol iii h
 the abbot
lochleven withdrawing her head from the
window the boat comes as fast as sail and
oar can send wood through water it brings
the leech and a female certainly from the
appearance the very person i was in quest
 were she but well out this castle
with our honour safe i would that she were
on the top the wildest mountain in norway
or i would i had been there myself
ere i had undertaken this trust
while she thus expressed herself standing
apart at one window roland gramme
from the other watched the boat bursting
through the waters the lake which glided
from its side in ripple and in foam he
too became sensible that at the stern was
seated the medical chamberlain clad in his
black velvet cloak and that his own relative
magdalen graeme in her assumed character
 mother nicneven stood in the bow
her hands clasped together and pointed towards
the castle and her attitude even at
that distance expressing enthusiastic eagerness
to arrive at the landingplace they
the abbot 
arrived there accordingly and while the
supposed witch was detained in a room beneath
the physician was ushered to the
queen's apartment which he entered withall
due professional solemnity catherine
had in the meanwhile fallen back from the
queen's bed and taken an opportunity to
whisper to roland methinks from the
information the threadbare velvet cloak
and the solemn beard there would be little
trouble in haltering yonder ass but thy
grandmother roland thy grandmother's
zeal will ruin us if she get not a hint to dissemble

roland without reply glided toward the
door the apartment crossed the parlour
and safely entered the antichamber but
when he attempted to pass farther the word
back back echoed from one to the other
by two men armed with carabines convinced
him that the lady lochleven's suspicions
had not even in the midst her
alarms been so far lulled to sleep as to omit
the precaution stationing sentinels on
 the abbot
her prisoners he was compelled therefore
to return to the parlour or audiencechamber
in which he found the lady the
castle in conference with her learned leech
a truce with your cant phrase and
your solemn foppery lundinin such terms
she accosted the man art and let me
know instantly if thou canst tell whether
this lady hath swallowed aught that is less
than wholesome
 nay but good lady honoured patroness
 to whom i am alike bondsman in my
medical and official capacity deal reasonably
with me if this mine illustrious patient
will not answer a question saving
with sighs and moans if that other honourable
lady will do nought but yawn in my
face when i enquire after the diagnostics 
and if that other young damsel who i profess
is a comely maidens
 talk not to me comeliness or 
damsels said the lady lochleven i
say are they evildisposed in one word
man have they taken poison ay or no 
the abbot 
poisons madam said the learned leech
 are various sorts there is your animai
poison as the lepus marinus as mentioned
by dioscorides and galen there are mineral
and semimineral poisons as those compounded
 sublimate regulus antimony
vitriol and the arsenical salts there are
your poisons from herbs and vegetables as
the aqua cymbal arise opium aconitum cantharides
and the like there are also
 now out upon thee for a learned fool i
and i myself am no better for expecting an
oracle from such a log said the lady
 nay but if your ladyship will have patience
 if i knew what food they have partaken
 or could see but the remnants 
what they have last eaten for as to the external
and internal symptoms i can discover
nought like for as galen saith in his
second de antidotes
away fool said the lady j send me
that hag hither j she shall avouch what it
was that she hath given to the wretch
 the abbot
dryfesdale or the pilniewinks and thumbs
shall wrench it out her finger joints
 art hath no enemy unless the ignorant
said the mortified doctor veiling
however his remark under the latin version
and stepping apart into a corner to
watch the result
in a minute or two magdalen grasme
entered the apartment dressed as we have
described her at the revel but with her
muffler thrown back and all affectation 
disguise she was attended by two guards
 whose presence she did not seem even
to be conscious and who followed her with
an air embarrassment and timidity which
was probably owing to their belief in her
supernatural power coupled with the effect
produced by her bold and undaunted demeanour
she confronted the lady 
lochleven who seemed to endure with
high disdain the confidence her look and
manner
 wretched woman said the lady after
the abbot 
essaying for a moment to bear her down before
she addressed her by the stately severity
 her look what was that powder which
thou didst give to a servant this house
by name robert dryfesdale that he might
work out with it some slow and secret vengeance
 confess its nature and properties
or by the honour douglas i give thee
to fire and stake before the sun is lower i
 alas said magdalen graeme in reply
and when became a douglas or a douglas's
man so unfurnished his means 
revenge that he should seek them at the
hands a poor and solitary woman the
towers in which your captives pine away
into unpitied graves yet stand fast on the
foundation the crimes wrought in them
have not yet burst their vaults asunder 
your men have still their crossbows pistolets
and daggers why need you seek
to herbs or charms for the execution 
your revenges 
 hear me foul hag said the lady 
lochleven but what avails speaking to
 the abbot
thee bring drjfesdale hither and let
them be confronted together
 you may spare your retainers the labour
replied magdalen graeme i came
not here to be confronted with a base
groom nor to answer the interrogatories 
james's heretical leman i came to speak
with the queen scotland give place
there 
and while the lady lochleven stood
confounded at her boldness and at the reproach
she had cast upon her magdalen
grseme strode past her into the bedchamber
 the queen and kneeling on the floor
made a salutation as if in the oriental fashion
she meant to touch the earth with
her forehead
 hail princess she said hail daughter
 many a king but graced above them
all in that thou art called to suffer for the
true faith hail to thee the pure gold 
whose crown has been tried in the seventimes
heated furnace affliction hear the
comfort which god and our lady send
the abbot 
thee by the mouth thy unworthy servant
 but first and stooping her head
she crossed herself repeatedly and still upon
her knees appeared to be rapidly reciting
some formula devotion
 seize her and drag her to the massymore
i to the deepest dungeon with the
sorceress whose master the devil could
alone have inspired her with boldness
enough to insult the mother douglas in
his own castle
thus spoke the incensed lady lochleven
but the physician presumed to interposes

 i pray you honoured madam she
be permitted to take her course without interruption
peradventure we shall learn
something concerning the nostrum she hath
ventured contrary to law and the rules 
art to exhibit to these ladies through the
medium the steward dryfesdale
 for a fool replied the lady locris
 thou hast counselled wisely i
h a
 the abbot
will bridle ray resentment till their conference
be over
 god forbid honoured lady said doctor
lundin that you should suppress it
longer nothing may more endanger the
frame your honoured body and truly
if there be witchcraft in this matter it is
held by the vulgar and even by solid authors
on daemonology that three scruples the
ashes the witch when she hath been welland
carefully burned at a stake is a grand
catholicon in such matter even as they
prescribe crisis canis rabid a hair the
dog that bit the patient in cases hydrophobia
i warrant neither treatment being
out the regular practice the schools 
but in the present case there can be little
harm in trying the conclusion upon this old
necromancer and quacksalver a experiments
as we say in corpore vil
peace fool said the lady she is
about to speak
at that moment magdalen graeme arose
from her knees and turned her countenance
the abbot 
on the queen at the same time advancing
her foot extending her arm and assuming
the mien and attitude a sybil in frenzy
as her grey hair floated back from under
her coif and her eye gleamed fire from under
its shaggy eye brow the effect her
expressive though emaciated features was
heightened by an enthusiasm approaching
to insanity and her appearance struck with
awe all who were present her eyes for a
time glanced wildly around as if seeking
for something to aid her in collecting her
powers expression and her lips had a
nervous and quivering motion as those 
one who would fain speak yet rejects as
inadequate the words which present themselves
mary herself caught the infection
as if by a sort magnetic influence and
raising herself from her bed without being
able to withdraw her eyes from those magdalen
waited as if for the oracle a pythoness
she waited not long for no sooner had
the enthusiast collected herself than her
gaze became intensely steady her features
 the abb or
assumed a determined energy and no sooner
did she begin to speak than the words flowed
from her with a profuse fluency which
might have passed for inspiration and which
perhaps she herself mistook for such
arise she said queen france
and england arise lioness scotland
and be not dismayed though the nets 
the hunters have encircled thee stoop not
to feign with the false ones whom thou shall
soon meet in the field the issue battle
is with the god armies but by battle thy
cause shall be tried lay aside then the
arts lower mortals and assume those
which become a queen true defender 
lie only true faith the armoury heaven
is open to thee faithful daughter the
church take the keys st peter to bind
and to loose royal princess the land
take the sword saint paul to smite and
to shear there is darkness in thy destiny j 
but not in these towers not under the rule
 their haughty mistress shall that destiny
be closed in other lands the lioness may
the abbot 
crouch to the power the tigress but not
in her own not in scotland shall the queen
 scotland long remain captive nor is the
fate the royal stuart in the hands the
traitor douglas let the lady lochleven
double her bolts and deepen her dungeons
they shall not retain thee each element
shall give thee its assistance ere thou
shalt continue captive the land shall lend
its earthquakes the water its waves the air
its tempests the fire its devouring flames
to desolate this house rather than it shall
continue the place thy captivity hear
this and tremble all ye who fight against
the light for she says it to whom it hath
been assured 
she was silent and the astonished physician
said if there was ever an jenergu
mene or possessed demoniac in our days
there is a devil speaking with that woman's
tongue
 practice said the lady lochleven
recovering her surprise here is all prac
 the abbot
time and imposture to the dungeon with
her
lady lochleven said mary arising
from her bed and coming forward with her
wonted dignity ere you make arrest on
any one in our presence hear me but one
word i have done you some wrong i believed
you privy to the murderous purpose
 your vassal and i deceived you in suffering
you to believe it had taken effect i
did you wrong lady lochleven for i
perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere
we tasted not the liquid nor are
we now sick save that we languish for our
freedom
 it is avowed like mary scotland
said magdalen graeme and know besides
that had the queen drained the
draught to the dregs it was harmless as
the water from a sainted spring trow ye
proud woman she added addressing herself
to the lady lochleven that i i
would have been the wretch to put poi
the abbot 
son in the hands a servant or vassal the
house lochleven knowing whom that
house contained as soon would i have furnished
drug to slay my own daughter
 am i thus bearded in mine own castle
said the lady to the dungeon with her 
she shall able what is due to the vender 
poisons and practiser witchcraft
yet hear me for an instant lady 
lochleven said mary and do you to
magdalen be silent at my command 
your steward lady has by confession attempted
my life and those my household
and this woman hath done her best to
save them by furnishing him with what was
harmless in place the fatal drugs which
he expected methinks i propose to you
but a fair exchange when say i forgive
your vassal with all my heart and leave
vengeance to god and to his conscience
so that you also forgive the boldness this
woman in your presence for we trust you
do not hold it as a crime that she subsoil
 the abbot
tuned an innocent beverage for the mortal
poison which was to have drenched our
cup
 heaven forefend madam said the lady
 that i should account that a crime which
saved the house douglas from a foul
breach honour and hospitality we have
written to our son touching our vassals delict
and he must abide his doom which
will most likely be death touching this
woman her trade is damnable by scripture
and is mortally punished by the wise laws
 our ancestry she also must abide her
doom
and have i then said the queen no
claim on the house lochleven for the
wrong i have so nearly suffered within their
walls i ask but in requital the life a frail
and aged woman whose brain as yourself
may judge seems somewhat affected by
years and suffering
 if the lady mary replied the inflexible
lady lochleven hath been mena
the abbot 
cet with wrong in the house douglas it
may be regarded as some compensation that
her complete have cost that house the exile
 a valued son
 plead no more for me my gracious
sovereign said magdalen graeme nor
abase yourself to ask so much as a grey
hair my head at her hands i knew the
risk at which i served my church and my
queen and was ever prompt to pay my poor
life as the ransom it is a comfort to think
that in slaying me or in restraining my freedom
or even in injuring that single grey
hair the house whose honour she boasts
so highly will have filled up the measure
 their shame by the breach their solemn
written assurance safety and
taking from her bosom a paper she handed
it to the queen
 it is a solemn assurance safety in
life and limb said queen mary with
space to come and to go under the hand
and seal the chamberlain kinross
 the abbot
granted to magdalen graeme commonly
called mother nicneven in consideration
 her consenting to put herself for the
space twentyfour hours if required within
the iron gate the castle cochlea

 knave said the lady turning to the
chamberlain how dared you grant her
such a protection 
it was by your ladyship's orders transmitted
by randal as he can bear witness
replied doctor lundin j nay i am only
like the pharmacopoeia who compounds
the drugs after the order the medicines
 i remember i remember answered
the lady but i meant the assurance only
to be used in case by residing in another
jurisdiction she could not have been apprehended
under our warrant
nevertheless said the queen the
lady lochleven is bound by the action
 her deputy in granting the assurance
madam replied the lady the house
the abbot 
 douglas have never broken their safeconduct
and never will do too deeply did
they suffer by such a breach trust exercised
on themselves when your grace's ancestor
the second james in defiance the
rights hospitality and his own written
assurance safety poniard the brave
earl douglas with his own hand and
within two yards the social board at
which he had just before sat the king 
scotland's honoured guest
 methinks said the queen carelessly
 in consideration so very recent and
enormous a tragedy which i think only
chanced some six score years agone the
douglasseses should have shewn themselves
less tenacious the company their sovereigns
than you lady lochleven seem
to be mine
let randal said the lady take the hag
back to kinross and set her at full liberty
discharging her from our bounds in future
on peril her head and let your wisdom
to the chamberlain keep her 
the abbot
any and fear not for your character
though i send you in such company j for
granting her to be a witch it would be a
waste faggots to burn you for a wizard
the crestfallen chamberlain was preparing
to depart j but magdalen graeme collecting
herself was about to reply when the
queen interposed saying good mother
we heartily thank you for your unfeigned
zeal towards our person and pray you as our
liege woman that you abstain from whatever
may lead you into personal danger and
further it is our will that you depart without
a word farther parley with any one in
this castle for thy present guerdon take
this small reliquary it was given to us by
our uncle the cardinal and hath had the
benediction the holy father himself 
and now depart in peace and in silence
for you learned sir continued the queen
advancing to the doctor who made his reverence
in a manner doubly embarrassed
by the awe the queen's presence which
made him fear to do too little and by the
the abbot 
apprehension his lady's displeasure incase
he should chance to do too much 
 for you learned sir as it was not your
fault though surely our own good fortune
that we did not need your skill at this time
it would not become us however circumstanced
to suffer our leech to leave us without
such guerdon as we can offer
with these words and with the grace
which never forsook her though in the present
case there might lurk under it a little
gentle ridicule she offered a small embroidered
purse to the chamberlain who with
extended hand and arched back his learned
face stooping until a physiognomist
might have practised the microscopical
science upon it as seen from behind betwixt
his gambadoes was about to accept
 the professional recompence offered by
so fair as well as illustrious an hand but
the lady interposed and regarding the
chamberlain said aloud no servant 
our house without instantly relinquishing
 the abbot
that character and incurring withal our
highest displeasure shall dare receive any
gratuity at the hand the lady mary
sadly and slowly the chamberlain raised
his depressed stature into the perpendicular
attitude and left the apartment dejectedly
followed by magdalen graeme after
with mute but expressive gesture she had
kissed the reliquary with which the queen
had presented her and raising her clasped
hands and uplifted eyes towards heaven had
seemed to entreat a benediction upon the
royal dame as she left the castle and
went towards the quay where the boat lay
roland graeme anxious to communicate
with her if possible threw himself in her
way and might have succeeded in exchanging
a few words with her as she was guarded
only by the dejected chamberlain and
his halberdiers but she seemed to have
taken in its most strict and literal acceptation
the command to be silent which
she had received from the queen for to
the abbot 
the repeated signs her grandson she
only replied by laying her finger on her
lip dr lundin was not so reserved regret
for the handsome gratuity and for the

he wiped his eyes stepped on the gunwale
and the boat pushed off from the
shore and went merrily across the lake
 which was dimpled by the summer wind 
the abbot 
chapter 
death distant no alas he's ever with u
and shakes the dart at us in all our actings 
he lurks within our cup while we're in health 
sits by our sickbed mocks our medicines 
we cannot walk or sit or ride or travel
but death is bye to seize us when he lists
the spanish father
from the agitating scene in the queen's
presencechamber the lady lochleven
retreated to her own apartment and ordered
the steward to be called before her
 have they not disarmed thee clydesdale
 she said on seeing him enter accoutered
as usual with sword and dagger
 no replied the old man how should
they your ladyship when you commanded
me to ward said nought laying
down my arms and i think none your
vol iii i
 the abbot
menials without your order or your son's
dare approach jasper dryfesdale for such
a purpose shall i now give up my sword
to you it is worth little now for it has
fought for your house till it is worn down
to cold iron like the panther's old chipping
knife
you have attempted a deadly crime 
poison under trust
 under trust hem i know not what
your ladyship thinks it but the world
without thinks the trust was given you even
for that very and you would have been
well off had it been so ended as i proposed
and you neither the worse nor the wiser
 wretch exclaimed the lady and
fool as villain who could not even execute
the crime he had planned 
 i bid as fair for it as man could replied
dryfesdale i went to a woman 
a witch and a papist if i found not poison
it was because it was otherwise predestined
i tried fair for it j but the halfdone job
may be clouted if you will
the abbot 
 villain i am even now about to send
off an express messenger to my son to take
order how thou shouldst be disposed 
prepare thyself for death if thou canst
 he that looks on death lady answered
dryfesdale as that which he may not
shun and which has its own fixed and certain
hour is ever prepared for it he that
is hanged in may will eat no flames in midsummer
 so there is the moan made for the
old servingman but whom pray i send
you on so fair an errand 
 there will be no lack messengers
answered his mistress
by my hand but there will replied
the old man your castle is but poorly
manned considering the watches that you
must keep having this charge there is
the warder and two others whom you discarded
for tampering with master george 
then for the warder's tower the bailie the
donjon five men mount each guard and
the rest must sleep for the most part in their
clothes to send away another man were
 the abdn
to harass the sentinels to death unthrifty
misuse for a household to take in new
soldiers were dangerous the charge requiring
tried men i see but one thing for
it i will do your errand to sir william
douglas myself
 that were indeed a resource and on
what day within twenty years would it be
done said the lady
 even with the speed man and horse
said clydesdale for though i care not
much about the latter days an old serving
man's life yet i would like to know as
soon as may be whether my neck is mine
own or the hangman's
 oldest thou thy own life so lightly j
said the lady
 else i had recked more that 
others said the predestinarian what is
death it is but ceasing to live and what
is living a weary return light and
darkness sleeping and waking being hungered
and eating your dead man needs
neither candle nor can neither fire nor
the abbot 
featherbed and the joiner's chest serves
him for an eternal freezejerkin
 wretched man believes thou not that
after the death comes the judgment 
lady answered dryfesdale as my
mistress i may not dispute your words but
as spiritually speaking you are still but a
burner bricks in egypt ignorant the
freedom the saints for as was well
shewn to me by that gifted man nicholas
schoefferbach who was martyred by the
bloody bishop munster he cannot sin
who doth but execute that which is predestined
since
silence said the lady interrupting
him answer me not with thy bold and
presumptuous blasphemy but hear me 
thou hast been long the servant our
house
 the bornservant the douglas they
have had the best me i served them
since left lockerbie i was then ten years
old and you may soon add the threescore
to it
 the abbot
thy foul attempt has miscarried so
thou art guilty only in intention it were
a deserved deed to hang thee on the warder's
tower and yet in thy present mind
it were but giving a soul to satan i take
thine offer then go hence here is my
packet i will add to it but a line to desire
him to send me a faithful servant or
two to complete the garrison let my son
deal with you as he will if thou art wise
thou wilt make for lockerbie so soon as
thy foot touches dry land and let the
packet find another bearer at all rates
look it miscarries not
nay madam replied he i was
born as i said the douglasseses servant and
i will be no corbiemessenger in mine old
age your message to your son shall be
done as truly by me as if it concerned another
man's neck i take my leave your
honour
the lady issued her commands and the
old man was ferried over to the shore to
proceed in his extraordinary pilgrimage it
is necessary the reader should accompany
the abbot 
him on his journey which providence had
determined should not be long duration
on arriving at the village the steward
although his disgrace had transpired was
readily accommodated with a horse by the
chamberlain's authority and the roads
being by no means esteemed safe he associated
himself with auchtermuchty the
common carrier in order to travel in his
company to edinburgh
the worthy waggoner according to the
established custom all carriers stagecoachmen
and other persons in such public
authority from the earliest days to the
present never wanted good reasons for
stopping upon the road as often and whereever
he would and the place which had
most captivation for him as a restingplace
was a changehouse as it was termed not
very distant from a romantic dell well
known by the name keirie crags attractions
 a kind very different from those
which arrested the progress john auch
termuchty and his pains still continue to
 the abbot
hover round this romantic spot and none
has visited its vicinity without a desire to
remain long and to return soon
arrived near his favourite howffy not all
the authority dryfesdale much diminished
indeed by the rumours his disgrace
could prevail on the carrier obstinate as
the brutes which he drove to pass on without
his accustomed halt for which the distance
he had travelled furnished little or
no pretence old keltic the landlord
who has bestowed his name on a bridge in
the neighbourhood his quondam dwelling
received the carrier with his usual festive
cordiality and adjourned with him into
the house under pretence important
business which i believe consisted in their
emptying together a mutchkin stoup usquebaugh
while the worthy host and his
guest were thus employed the discarded
steward with a double portion moroseness
in his gesture and look walked discontentedly
into the kitchen the place which
was occupied but by one guest the strange
abbot 
ger was a slight figure scarce above the age
 boyhood and in the dress a page bat
bearing an air haughty aristocratic boldness
and even insolence in his look and manner
that might have made dryfesdale conclude
he had pretensions to superior rank
had not his experience taught him how frequently
these airs superiority were assumed
by the domestics and military retainers
 the scottish nobility the pilgrim's
morning to you old sir said the youth 
 you come as i think from lochleven
castle what news our bonnie queen 
a fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched
a dovecot
 they that speak lochleven and 
those whom its walls contain answered
dryfesdale speak what concerns the
douglas and they who speak what concerns
the douglas do it at their peril
do you speak from fear them old
man or would you make a quarrel for them 
i should have deemed your age might
have cooled your blood
i 
 the abbot
 never while there are eraptypated
coxcombs at each corner to keep it warm
 the sight thy grey hairs keeps mine
cold said the boy who had risen up and
now sat down again
 it is well for thee or i had cooled it
with this hollyrod replied the steward
i think thou best one those swashbucklers
who brawl in alehouses and taverns
 and who if words were pikes and
oaths were andrew ferrara would soon
place the religion babylon in the land
once more and the woman moab upon
the throne
 now by saint bennet seyton said
the youth i will strike thee on the face
thou foulmouthed old railing heretic 
 saint bennet seyton echoed the
steward a proper warrant is saint bennet's
and for a proper nest wolfbirds
like the seytons i will arrest thee as a
traitor to king james and the good regent
ho john auchtermuchty raise aid
against the king's traitor 
the abbot 
so saying he laid his hand on the youth's
collar and drew his sword john auchter
muchty looked in but seeing the naked
weapon ran faster out thane entered keltic
the landlord stood by and helped neither
party only exclaiming gentlemen 
gentlemen for the love heaven and
so forth a struggle ensued in which the
young man chafed atdryfesdale's boldness
and unable with the ease he expected to
extricate himself from the old man's determined
grasp drew his dagger and with the
speed light dealt him three wounds in
the breast and body the least which was
mortal the old man sunk on the ground
with a deep groan and the host set up a
piteous exclamation surprise
 peace ye bawling hound said the
wounded steward are daggerstabs and
dying men such rarities in scotland that
you should cry as if the house were falling 
youth i do not forgive thee for there
is nought betwixt us to forgive thou hast
 the abbot
lone what i have done to more than one 
and i suffer what i have seen them suffer
it was all ordained to be thus and not
otherwise but i thou wouldst do me
right thou wilt send this packet safely to
the hands sir william douglas and
see that my memory suffer not as if i would
have loitered on mine errand for fear my
life
the youth whose passion had subsided
the instant he had done the deed listened
with sympathy and attention when another
person muffled in his cloak entered the
apartment and exclaimed good god 
dryfesdale and expiring 
ay and dryfesdale would that he had
been dead answered the wounded man
 rather than that his ears had heard the
words the only douglas that ever was
false but yet it is better as it is good my
murderer and the rest you stand back
a little and let me speak with this unhappy
apostate kneel down by me master
george you have heard that i failthe
abbot 
ed in my attempt to take away thatmoa
british stumblingblock and her retinue 
i gave them that which i thought would
have removed the temptation out thy
path and this though i had other reasons
to shew to thy mother and others i did
chiefly purpose for the love thee
 for the love me base poisoner 
wouldst thou have committed so horrible
so unprovoked a murder and mentioned
my name with it 
 and wherefore not george dou
glas answered dryfesdale breath is
now scarce with me but i would spend my
last gasp on this argument hast thou not
despite the honour thou west to thy parents
the faith that is due to thy religion
the truth that is due to thy king been so
carried away by the charms this beautiful
sorceress that thou wouldst have helped
her to escape from her prisonhouse and
again to ascend the throne which she had
made a place abomination nay stir not
 the abbot
from me my hand though fast stiffening
has yet force enough to hold thee what
dost thou aim at to wed this witch 
scotland i warrant thee thou mayst succeed
 her heart and hand have been oft
won at a cheaper rate than thou fool that
thou art would think thyself happy to pay
but should a servant thy father's house
have seen thee embrace the fate the
idiot darnley or the villain bothwell 
the fate the murdered fool or the
living pirate while an ounce rat's bane
would have saved thee 
think on god dry festal said george
douglas and leave the utterance those
horrors repent if thou canst if not at
least be silent seyton aid me to support
this dying wretch that he may compose
himself to better thoughts if it be possible
 seyton answered the dying man 
seyton is it by a seyton's hand that i
fall at last there is something retribution
in that since the house had nigh lost
the abbot 
a sister by my deed fixing his fading eyes
on the youth he added he hath her very
features and presence stoop down youth
and let me see thee closer i would know
thee when we meet in yonder world for homicides
will herd together there and i have
been one he pulled seyton's face in
spite some resistance closer to his own
looked at him fixedly and added thou
hast begun young thy career will be the
briefer ay thou wilt be met with and that
anon a young plant never throve that was
watered with an old man's blood yet why
blame i thee strange turns fate he
muttered ceasing to address seyton i
designed what i could not do and he has
done what he did not perchance design 
wondrous that our will should ever oppose
itself to the strong and uncontroulable tide
 destiny that we should strive with the
stream when we might drift with the current
 my brain will serve me to question
it no farther i would schoefferbach were
here yet why i am on a course which
 the abbot
the vessel can hold without a pilots farewell
george douglas i die true to thy
father's house he fell into convulsions
at these words and shortly after expired
seyton and douglas stood looking on the
dying man and when the scene was closed
the former was the first to speak as i
live douglas i meant not this and am sorry
 but he laid hands on me and compelled
me to defend my freedom as i best
might with my dagger if he were ten
times thy friend and follower i can but say
that i am sorry
i blame thee not seyton said douglas
 though i lament the chance there
is an overruling destiny above us though
not in the sense that wretched man who
beguiled by some foreign mystagogue used
the awful word as the ready apology for
whatever he chose to do eve must examine
the packet
they withdrew into an inner room and
remained deep in consultation until they
were disturbed by the entrance keltic
the abbot 
who with an embarrassed countenance asked
master george douglas's pleasure respecting
the disposal the body your
honour knows he added that i make my
bread by living men not by dead corpses 
and old mr dryfesdale who was but a sorry
customer while he was alive occupies my
public room now that he is deceased and
can neither call for ale nor brandy
tie a stone round his neck said seyton
 and when the sun is down have him
to the loch cherish heave him in and
let him alone for finding out the bottom
 under your favour sir said george
douglas it shall not be so keltic thou
art a true fellow to me and ihy having been
so shall advantage thee send or take the
body to the church ballingry and tell
what tale thou wilt his having fallen ina
brawl with some unruly guests thine
auchtermuchty knows nought else nor
are the times so peaceful as to admit close
looking into such accounts
 the abbot
 nay let him tell the truth said seyton
 so far as it harms not our scheme 
say that henry seyton met with him my
good fellow i care not a brass boodle for
the feud
a feud with the douglas was ever to
be feared however said george displeasure
mingling with his natural deep gravity
 manner
not when the best the name is on
my side replied seyton
 alas henry if thou meanest me i
am but half a douglas in this emprize 
half head half heart and half hand but i
will think on one who can never be forgotten
and be all or more than any my
ancestors was ever keltic say it was henry
seyton did the deed j but beware nota
word me let auchtermuchty carry
this packet which he had resealed with
his own signet to my father at edinburgh j
and here is to pay for the funeral expences
and thy loss custom
the abbot 
 and the washing the floor said the
landlord which will be an extraordinary
job for blood they say will scarcely ever
cleanse out
but as for your plan said george 
douglas addressing seyton as if in continuation
 what they had been before treating
 it has a good face j but under your
favour you are yourself too hot and too
young besides other reasons which are much
against your playing the part you propose
we will consult the father abbot upon
it said the youth do you ride to kinross
tonight 
 ay so i purpose answered douglas 
the night will be dark and suits a muff
r 
fled man keltie i forgot there should
be a stone laid on that man's grave recording
his name and his only merit which was
being a faithful servant to the douglas
 what religion was the man said
seyton he used words which made me
fear i have sent satan a subject before his
time
 the abbot
i can tell you little that said george
douglas he was noted for disliking both
rome and geneva and spoke lights he
had learned among the fierce sectaries 
lower germany an evil doctrine it was
if we judge by the fruits god keep us
from presumptuously judging heaven's
secrets 
amen said the young seyton and
from meeting any encounter this evening
 it is not thy wont to pray so said
george douglas
 no leave that to you replied the
youth when you are seized with scruples
 engaging with your father's vassals but
 would fain have this old man's blood off
these hands mine ere i shed more i
will confess to the abbot tonight and i
trust to have light penance for ridding the
earth such a miscreant all i sorrow for
is that he was not a score years younger
 he drew steel first however that is one
comfort

why youngster thou mayest cheat the old dueofta

but know that i her father play the gryphon
tameless and sleepless proof to fraud or bribe

the spanish father
the tenor our tale carries us back to
the castle lochleven where we take up
the order events on the same remarkable
day on which dryfesdale had been dismissed
from the castle it was past noon the
usual hour dinner yet no preparations
seemed made for the queen's entertainment
mary herself was retired into her
own apartment where she was closely engaged
in writing her attendants were together
in the presencechamber and much
 the abbot
disposed to speculate on the delay the
dinner for it may be recollected that their
breakfast had been interrupted i believe
in my conscience said the page
 that having found the poisoning scheme
miscarry by having gone to the wrong merchant
for their deadly wares they are now
about to try how famine will work upon
us
lady fleming was somewhat alarmed at
this surmise but comforted herself by observing
that the chimney the kitchen had
reeked that whole day in a manner which
contradicted the supposition catherine
seyton presently exclaimed they were
bearing the dishes across the court marshalled
by the lady lochleven herself
dressed out in her highest and stiffest ruff
with her partlet and sleeves cyprus and
her huge oldfashioned farthingale crimson
velvet
i believe on my word said the page
approaching the window also it was in
that very farthingale that she captivated
the heart gentle king jamie which prothe
abbot 
cured our poor queen her precious bargain
 a brother
 that may hardly be master roland
answered the lady fleming who was a
great recorder the changes fashion
 since the farthingales came first in when
the queen regent went to saint andrews
after the battle pinkie and were then
called pertains
she would have proceeded farther in this
important discussion but was interrupted
by the entrance the lady lochleven
who preceded the servants bearing the
dishes and formally discharged the duty 
tasting each them lady fleming regretted
in courtly phrase that the lady
 lochleven should have undertaken so
troublesome an office
 after the strange incident this day
madam said the lady it is necessary for
my honour and that my son that i partake
whatever is offered to my involuntary
guest please to inform the lady mary
that i attend her commands
 the abbot
 her majesty replied lady fleming
with due emphasis on the word shall be
informed that the lady lochleven waits
mary appeared instantly and addressed
her hostess with courtesy which even approached
to something more cordial this
is nobly done lady lochleven she said
 for though we ourselves apprehend no
danger under your roof our ladies have
been much alarmed by this morning's
chance and our meal will be the more
cheerful for your presence and assurance
please you to sit down
the lady lochleven obeyed the queen's
commands and roland performed the office
 carver and attendant as usual but
notwithstanding what the queen had said
the meal was silent and unsocial and every
effort which mary made to excite some conversation
died away under the solemn and
chill replies the lady lochleven at
length it became plain that the queen who
had considered her advances as a condense
abbot 
ascension on her part and who piqued herself
justly on her powers pleasing became offended
at the repulsive conduct her hostess
after looking with a significant glance
at lady fleming and catherine she slightly
shrugged her shoulders and remained silent
a pause ensued at the which
the lady douglas spoke i perceive
madam i am a check on the mirth this
fair company i pray you to excuse me 
i am a widow alone here in a most perilous
charge deserted by my grandson 
betrayed by my servant i am little worthy
 the grace you do me in offering me a
seat at your table where i am aware that
wit and pastime are usually expected from
the guests
 if the lady lochleven is serious said
the queen we wonder by what simplicity
she expects our present meals to be seasoned
with mirth if she is a widow she
lives honoured and uncontrouled at the
head her late husband's household but
vol iir k
gl the abbot
i know at least one widowed woman in
the world before whom the words desertion
and betrayal ought never to be mentioned
since no one has been made so bitterly
acquainted with their import
i meant not to remind you your
misfortunes by the mention mine answered
the lady lochleven and there was
again a deep silence
mary at length addressed lady fleming
 we can commit no deadly sins here vut
tonnes where we are so well warded and
looked to but if we could this carthusian
silence might be useful as a kind penance
if thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss my
fleming or if catherine hath made a wry
stitch in her broidery when she was thinking
 something else than her work or if
roland graeme hath missed a wildduck on
the wing and broke a quarrelpane glass
in the turret window as chanced to him
a week since now is the time to think on
your sins and to repent them
 madam i speak with all reverence
the abbot 
said the lady lochleven but i am old
and claim the privilege age methinks
your followers might find fitter subjects for
repentance than the trifles you mention and
so mention once more i crave your pardon
 as if you jested with sin and with repentance
both
you have been our taster lady lochleven
said the queen i perceive you
would eke out your duty with that our
father confessor and since you chuse that
our conversation should be serious may i
ask you why the regent's promise since
your son so styles himself has not been
kept to me in that respect from time to
time this promise has been renewed and
as constantly broken methinks those who
pretend themselves to so much gravity and
sanctity should not debar from others the
religious succours which their consciences
require
 madam the earl murray was indeed
weak enough said the lady lochleven
 to give so far way to your unhappy
 the abbot
prejudices and a religion the pope
presented himself on his part at our town
 kinross but the douglas is lord 
his own castle and will not permit his
threshold to be darkened no not for a single
moment by an emissary belonging to
the bishop rome
 methinks it were well then said mary
 that my lord regent would send me
where there is less scruple and more charity

in this madam answered the lady
lochleven you mistake the nature both
 charity and religion charity giveth
to those who are in delirium the medicaments
which may avail their health but
refuses those enticing cates and liquors
which please the palate but augment the
disease
 this your charity lady lochleven is
pure cruelty under the hypocritical disguise
 friendly care i am oppressed
amongst you as if you meant the destruction
both my body and soul but heath
abbot 
even will not endure such iniquity for ever
and they who are the most active agents in
it may speedily expect their reward
at this moment landau entered the apartment
with a look so much perturbed that
the lady fleming uttered a faint scream
the queen was obviously startled and the
lady lochleven though too bold and
proud to evince any marked signs alarm
asked hastily what was the matter 
dryfesdale has been slain madam
was the reply murdered as soon as he
gained the dry landby young master henry
seyton
it was now catherine's turn to start and
grow pale has the murderer the
douglas's vassal escaped was the lady's
hasty question
there was none to challenge him but
oldkeltie and the carrier auchtermuchty
replied randal unlikely men to slay one
 the racket youths in scotland his
boldest most forward
 the abbot
years and who was sure to have friends and
partakers at no great distance
 was the deed completed said the
lady
 done and done thoroughly said randal
 a seyton seldom strikes twice but
the body was not despoiled and your ho 
your's packet goes forward to edinburgh by
auchtermuchty who leaves keltiebridge
early tomorrow marry he has drunk two
bottles aquavitfe to put the fright out 
his head and now sleeps them off beside
his cart avers t
there was a pause when this fatal tale
was told the queen and lady douglas
looked on each other as if each thought
how she could best turn the incident to her
own advantage in the controversy which
was continually kept alive betwixt them 
catherine seyton kept her kerchief at her
eyes and wept
 you see madam the bloody maxims
and practice the deluded papists said
lady lochleven
the abbot 
nay madam replied the queen
say rather you see the deserved judgment
 heaven upon a calvinistical poisoner
dryfesdale was not the church 
geneva or scotland said the lady
lochleven hastily
he was a heretic however replied
mary there is but one true and unerring
guide the others lead alike into error
well madam i trust it will reconcile
you to your retreat that this deed shews
the temper those who might wish you at
liberty bloodthirsty tyrants and cruel
manquellers are they all from the clanronald
andclantosach in the north to the
ferniherst and buccleuch in the south 
the murdering seytons in the east and
 methinks madam you forget that i
am a seyton said catherine withdrawing
her kerchief from her face which was now
coloured with indignation
if had forgot it fair mistress your
forward bearing would have reminded me
said lady lochleven
 the abbot
 if my brother has slain the villain that
would have poisoned his sovereign and his
sister said catherine am only so far
sorry that he should have spared the hangman
his proper task for aught further
had it been the best douglas in the land
he would have been honoured in falling by
the seyton's sword
farewell gay mistress said the lady
 lochleven rising to withdraw it is
such maidens as you who make giddyfashioned
revellers and deadly brawlers boys
must needs rise forsooth in the grace 
some sprightly damsel who thinks to dance
through life as through a french galliard
she then made her reverence to the queen
and added do you also madam fare you
well till curfew time when i will make
perchance more bold than welcome in attending
upon your supper board come
with me randal and tell me more this
cruel fact
tis an extraordinary chance said the
queen when she had departed and
the abbot 
villain as he was i would this man had been
spared time for repentance we will cause
something to be done for his soul if weever
attain our liberty and the church will
permit such grace to an heretic but tell
me catherine ma mignonne this brother 
thine who is ofracky as the fellow called
him bears he the same wonderful likeness
to thee as formerly 
if your grace means in temper you
know whether lam ofrack as the servingman
spoke him
nay thou art prompt enough in all
reasonable conscience replied the queen 
but thou art my own darling notwithstanding
 but i meant is this thy twinbrother
as like thee in form and features
as formerly i remember thy dear mother
alleged it as a reason for destining thee to
the veil that were ye both to go at large
thou wouldst surely get the credit some
 thy brother's mad pranks
 i believe madam said catherine
 there are some unusually simple people
k 
g the abbot
even yet who can hardly distinguish betwixt
us especially when for diversion's
sake my brother hath taken a female dress
and as she spoke she gave a quick glance
at roland grseme to whom this conversation
conveyed a ray light welcome as
ever streamed into the dungeon a captive
through the door which opened to give
him freedom 
he must be a handsome cavalier this
brother thine if he be so like you replied
mary he was in france i think
for these late years so that i saw him not
at holyrood
his looks madam have never been
much found fault with answered catherine
seyton but i would he had less 
that angry and heady spirit which evil times
have encouraged amongst our young nobles
god knows i grudge not his life in
your grace's quarrel j and love him for the
willingness with which he labours for your
rescue but wherefore should he brawl
with an old ruffianly servingman and stain
the abbot 
at once his name with such a broil and his
hands with the blood an old and ignoble
wretch 
nay be patient catherine i will not
have thee traduce my gallant young knight
with henry for my knight and roland
gramme for my trusty squire methinks i am
like a princess romance who may shortly
set at defiance the dungeons and the weapons
 all wicked sorcerers but my headaches
with the agitation the day take
me la mer des histoires and resume where
we left off on wednesday our lady help
thy head girl or rather may she help thy
heart i asked thee for the sea histories
and thou hast brought la comique
d'armurt
once embarked upon the sea histories
the queen continued her labours with her
needle while lady fleming and catherine
read to her alternately for two hours
as to roland graeme it is probable that
he continued in secret intent upon the chronicle
 love notwithstanding the censure
 the abbot
which the queen seemed to pass upon that
branch study he now remembered a
thousand circumstances voice and manner
which had his own prepossession been
less must surely have discriminated the brother
from the sister and he felt ashamed
that having as it were by heart every particular
 catherine's gestures words and
manners he should have thought her notwithstanding
her spirits and levity capable
cf assuming the bold step loud tones and
forward assurance which accorded well
enough with her brother's hasty and masculine
character he endeavoured repeatedly
to catch a glance catherine's eye
that he might judge how she was disposed
to look upon him since he had made the
discovery but he was unsuccessful for catherine
when she was not reading herself
seemed to take so much interest in the exploits
 the teutonic knights against the
heathens esthonia and livonia that he
could not surprise her eye even for a second
but when closing the the queen comthe
abbot 
landed their attendance in the garden
mary perhaps set purpose for roland's
anxiety could not escape so practised an observer
afforded him a favourable opportunity
 accosting his mistress the queen
commanded them to a little distance while
she engaged lady fleming in a particular
and private conversation the subject whereof
we learn from another authority to have
been the comparative excellence the high
standing ruff and the falling band roland
must have been duller and more sheepish
than ever was youthful lover if he had not
endeavoured to avail himself this opportunity

i have been longing this whole evening
to ask you fair catherine said the
page how foolish and unapprehensive you
must have thought me in being capable to
mistake betwixt your brother and you 
 the circumstance does indeed little honour
to my rustic manners said catherine
since those a wild young man were so
readily mistaken for mine but i shall grow
 the abbot
wiser in time and with that view i am determined
not to think your follies but
to correct my own
 it will be the lighter subject meditation
 the two said roland
 i know not that said catherine very
gravely i fear we have been both unpardonably
foolish
 i have been mad said roland unpardonably
mad but you lovely catherine

 i said catherine in the same tone 
unusual gravity have too long suffered
you to use such expressions towards me 
i fear i can permit it no longer and i blame
myself for the pain it may give you
and what can have happened so suddenly
to change our relation to each other
or alter with such sudden cruelty your
whole deportment to me 
i can hardly tell replied catherine
 unless it is that the events the day have
impressed on my mind the necessity our
observing more distance to each other a
the abbot 
chance similar to that which betrayed to you
the existence my brother may make
known to henry the terms you have used
to me and alas his whole conduct as
well as his deed this day makes me too justly
apprehensive the consequences
 fear nothing for that fair catherine
answered the page i am well able to
protect myself against risks that nature
that is to say replied she that you
would fight with my twinbrother to shew
your regard for his sister i have heard
the queen say in her sad hours that men
are in love or in hate the most selfish animals
 creation and your carelessness in
this matter looks very like it but be not
so much abashed you are no worse than
others
you do me injustice catherine replied
the page i thought but being
threatened with a sword and did not remember
in whose hand your fancy had
placed it if your brother stood before me
with his drawn weapon in his hand so like
 the abbot
as be is to you in word person an favour
he might shed my life'sblood ere i could
find in my heart to resist him to his injury
 alas said she it is not my brother j
alone but you remember only the singular
circumstances in which we have met in equality
and i may say in intimacy you think
not that whenever i reenter my father's
house there is a gulph between us you may
not pass but with peril your life your
only known relative is wild and singular
habits a hostile and broken clan the
rest your lineage unknown forgive me
that i speak what is the undeniable truth
 love my beautiful catherine despises
genealogies answered roman gramme
love may but so will not the lord
seton rejoined the damsel
the queen thy mistress and mine she
will intercede o drive me not from you
at the moment i thought myself most happy
i sand if i shall aid her deliverance said
not yourself that you and she would become
my debtors 
the abbot 
 all scotland will become your debtors
said catherine but for the active
effects you might hope from our gratitude
you must remember i am wholly subjected
to my father and the poor queen is for a
long time more likely to be dependent on
the pleasure the nobles her party
than possessed power to controul them
be it so replied roland my deeds
shall controul prejudice itself it is a bustling
world and i will have my share the
knight avenel high as he now stands
rose from as obscure an origin as mine
 ay said catherine there spoke the
doughty knight romance that will cut
his way to the imprisoned princess through
fiends and fiery dragons
 but i can set the princess at large
and procure her the freedom lier own
choice said the page where dearest catherine
will that choice alight 
 release the princess from dress and
she will tell you said the damsel j and
 the abbot
breaking off the conversation abruptly she
joined the queen so suddenly that mary
exclaimed half aloud
no more tidings evil import no dissention
i trust in my limited household 
then looking on catherine's blushing cheek
and roland's expanded brow and glancing
eye no no she said i see all is
well ma petite mignonne go to my apartment
and fetch me down let me see ay
fetch my pomander box
and having thus disposed her attendant
in the manner best qualified to hide her
confusion the queen added speaking apart
to roland should at least have two grateful
subjects catherine and you for what
sovereign but mary would aid truelove so
willingly ay you lay your hand on your
sword your petite flamherge a rien there
well short time will shew if all the good
be true that is protested to us i hear them
toll curfew from kinross to our chamber
this old dame hath promised to be with
the abbot 
us again at our evening meal were it not
for the hope speedy deliverance her presence
would drive me distracted but i
will be patient
i profess said catherine would i
could be henry with all a man's privileges
for one moment i long to throw my plate
at that confect pride and formality and
illnature
the lady fleming reprimanded her
young companion for this explosion impatience
y the queen laughed and they
went to the presencechamber where almost
immediately entered supper and the
lady the castle the queen strong in
her prudent resolutions endured her presence
with great fortitude and equanimity
until her patience was disturbed by a new
form which had hitherto made no part 
the ceremonial the castle when the
other attendant had retired randal entered
bearing the keys the castle fastened
upon a chain and announcing that the
 the abbot
watch was set and the gates locked delivered
the keys with all reverence to the
lady lochleven
the queen and her ladies exchanged
with each other a look disappointment
anger and vexation and mary said aloud
 we cannot regret the smallness our
court when we see our hostess discharge
in person so many its offices addition
to her charges principal steward 
our household and grani almoner she
has tonight done duty as captain our
guard
and will continue to do so in future
madam answered the lady lochleven
with much gravity the history scotland
may teach me how ill the duty is performed
which is done by an accredited deputy
 we have heard madam favourites
 later date and as little merit as oliver
sinclair
 o madam replied the queen my
father had his female as well as his male fathe
abbot 
favourites there were the ladies sandilandsv
and olifaiint and some others methinks 
but their names cannot survive in the memory
 so grave a person as you
the lady lochleven looked as if she
could have slain the queen on the spot but
commanded her temper and retired from
the apartment bearing in her hand the ponderous
bunch keys
now god be praised for that vioman's
youthful frailty said the queen had she
not that weak point io her character i might
waste my words on her in vain but that
stain is the very reverse what is said 
the witch's mark i can make her feel there
though she is otherwise insensible all over
but how say you girls here is a new
difficulty how are these keys to be come
by there is no deceiving or bribing this
dragon i trow
may i crave to know said roland
 whether if your grace were beyond the
walls the castle you could find means 
 the abbot
conveyance to the firm land and protection
when you are there
trust us for that roland said the
queen for to that point our scheme is
indifferent well laid
then if your grace will permit me to
speak my mind i think i could be some
use in this matter
 as how my good youth speak on
said the queen and fearlessly
 my patron the knight avenel used
to compel the youth educated in his household
to learn the use axe and hammer
and working in wood and iron he used to
speak old northern champions who forged
their own weapons and the highland
captain donald nan ord or donald
 the hammer whom he himself knew
and who used to work at the anvil with a
sledgehammer in each hand some said
he praised this art because he was himself
 churl's blood however i gained some
practice in it as the lady catherine sey ton
the abbot 
partly knows for since we were here i
wrought her a silver broach
ay replied catherine but you
should tell her grace that your workmanship
was so indifferent that it broke to pieces
next day and i flung it away
 believe her not roland said the
queen she wept when it was broken
and put the fragments into her bosom but
for your scheme could your skill avail to
forge a second set keys 
no madam because i know not the
wards but i am convinced i could make
a set so like that hateful bunch which the
lady bore off even now that could they be
exchanged against them by any means she
would never dream she was possessed the
wrong
and the good dame thank heaven is
somewhat blind said the queen but
then for a forge my boy and the means 
labouring unobserved 
 the armourer's forge at which i used
sometimes to work with him is in the round
 the abbot
vault at the bottom the turret he was
dismissed with the warder for being supposed
too much attached to george douglas
the people are accustomed to see me work
there and i will find some excuse that will
pass current with them for putting bellows
and anvil to work
 the scheme has a promising face said
the queen about it my lad with all speed
and beware the nature your work is not
discovered
nay i will take the liberty to draw the
bolt against chance visitors so that i will
have time to put away what am working
upon before i undo the door
 will not that itself attract suspicion
in a place where it is so current already 
said catherine
 not a whit replied roland j gregory
the armourer and every good hamgerman
locks himself in when he is about
some masterpiece craft besides something
must be risked
the abbot 
part we then tonight said the queen
and god bless you my children if
mary's head ever rises above water you
shall all arise along with her
vol il
 the abb or
chapter viii
it is a time danger not revel
when churchmen turn masquers
spanish father
the enterprize roland grseme appeared
to prosper a trinket or two which
the work did not surpass the substance for
the materials were silver supplied by the
queen were judiciously presented to those
most likely to be inquisitive into the labours
 the forge and anvil which they thus were
induced to reckon profitable to others and
harmless in itself openly the page was
seen working about such trifles in private
he forged a number keys resembling so
nearly in weight and in form those which
were presented every evening to the lady
lochleven that on a slight inspection it
would have been difficult to perceive the
the abbot 
difference he brought them to the dark
rusty colour by the use salt and water 
and in the triumph his art presented
them at length to queen mary in her 
about an hour before the
tolling the curfew she looked at them
with pleasure but at the same time with
doubts i allow she said that the
lady lochleven's eyes which are not 
the clearest may be well deceived could
we pass those keys on her in place the
real implements her tyranny but how
is this to be done and which my little
court dare attempt this tour de jongleur
with any chance success could we but
engage her in some earnest matter argument
 but those which i hold with her
always have been a kind which make her
grasp her keys the faster as if she said to
herself here i hold what sets me above
your taunts and reproaches and even for
her liberty mary stuart could not stoop to
speak the proud heretic fairwhat shall
we do shall lady fleming try her elo
 the abbot
quench in describing the last new headtire
from paris alas the good dame has
not changed the fashion her head gear
since pinkiefield for aught that i know
shall my mignonne catherine sing to her
one those touching airs which draw the
very souls out me and roland graeme 
alas dame margaret douglas would rather
hear a huguenot psalm sung to the tune 
reveilles vous helle endormie cousins and
liege counsellors what is to be done for
our wits are really astray in this matter 
must our manatarms and the champion 
our body roland graeme manfully assault
the old lady and take the keys from her
par vote du fait v
nay with your grace's permission
said roland i doubt not to manage the
matter with more discretion for though in
your grace's service i do not fear
 a host old women interrupted catherine
 each armed with rock and spindle
yet he has no fancy for pikes and partizans

the abbot 
 they that do not fear fair ladies
tongues continued the page need dread
nothing else but gracious liege i am
well nigh satisfied that i could pass the
exchange these keys on the lady lochleven
 but i dread the sentinel who is now
planted nightly in the garden which by
necessity we must traverse
our last advices from our friend on the
shore have promised us assistance in that
matter replied the queen
and is your grace well assured the
fidelity and watchfulness those without v
 for their fidelity i will answer with
my life and for their vigilance i will answer
with my lifei will give thee instant
proof my faithful roland that they are ingenious
and trusty as thyself come hither
 nay catherine attend us we carry
not so deft a page into our private chamber
alone make fast the door the parlour
fleming and warn us if you hear the
least step or stay go thou to the door
catherine in a whisper thy ears and thy
 the abbot
wits are both sharper good fleming attend
us thyself and again she whispered
her reverend presence will be as safe a
watch on roland as thine can so be not
jealous mignonne
thus speaking they were lighted by the
lady fleming into the queen's bedroom
a small apartment enlightened by a projecting
window
 look from that window roland she
said see you amongst the several lights
which begin to kindle and to glimmer palely
through the grey the evening from the
village kinross seest thou i say one
solitary spark apart from the others and
nearer it seems to the verge the water 
it is no brighter at this distance than the
torch the poor glowworm and yet my
good youth that light is more dear to mary
stuart than every star that twinkles in the
blue vault heaven by that signal i
know that more than one true heart are
plotting my deliverance and without that
consciousness and the hope freedom it
the abbot 
gives me i had long since stooped to my
fate and died a broken heart plan after
plan has been formed and abandoned but
still the light glimmers and while it glimmers
my hope lives o how many evenings
have i sat musing in despair over our
ruined schemes and scarce hoping that i
should again see that blessed signal when it
has suddenly kindled and like the lights 
saint elms in a tempest brought hope and
consolation where there was only dejection
and despair 
 if i mistake not answered roland
 tlie candle shines from the house 
the mail gardener
 thou hast a good eye said the queen 
it is there where my trusty lieges god
and the saints pour blessings on them 
hold consultation for my deliverance the
voice a wretched captive would die on
these blue waters long ere it could mingle
in their councils and yet i can hold communication
 i will confide the whole to
s the abbot
thee i am about to ask those faithful
friends if the moment for the great attempt
is nigh place the lamp in the window fleming

she obeyed and immediately withdrew
it no sooner had she done so than the
light in the cottage the gardener disappeared

 now count said queen mary for
my heart beats so thick that i cannot count
myself
the lady fleming began deliberately to
count one two three and when she had arrived
at ten the light on the shore again
shewed its pale twinkle
now our lady be praised said the
queen it was but two nights since that
the absence the light remained while i
could tell thirty the hour deliverance
approaches may god bless those who labour
in it with such truth to me alas 
with such hazard to themselves and bless
you too my children come we must to
the abbot 
the audiencechamber again our absence
might excite suspicion should they serve
the supper
they returned to the presencechamber
and the evening concluded as usual
the next morning at dinnertime an
unusual incident occurred while lacy
douglas loehleven performed her daily
duty assistant and taster at the queen's
table she was told a manetarms had arrived
recommended by her son but without
any letter or other token than what he
brought by word mouth
hath he given you that token demanded
the lady
 he reserved it as i think for your
ladyship's ear replied randal
 he doth well said the lady tell
him to wait in the hall but no with your
permission madam to the queen let him
attend me here
 since you are pleased to receive your
domestics in my presence said the queen
i cannot chuse 
l 
 the abbot
 my infirmities must plead my excuse
madam replied the lady the life i must
lead here ill suits with the years which have
passed over my head and compels me to
waive ceremonial
 o my good lady replied the queen
 i would there were nought in this your
castle more strongly compulsive than the
cobweb chains ceremony but bolts and
bars are harder matters to contend with
as she spoke the person announced by
randal entered the room and roland
gramme at once recognized in him the abbot
ambrosius
what is your name good fellow said
the lady
edward glendinning answered the
abbot with a suitable reverence
 art thou the blood the knight
 avenel said the lady lochleven
ay madam and that nearly replied
the pretended soldier
 it is likely enough said the lady for
the knight is the son his own good works
the abbot 
and has risen from obscure lineage to this
present high rank in the estate but he is
 sure truth and approved worth and his
kinsman is welcome to us you hold unquestionably
the true faith 
do not doubt it madam said the
disguised churchman
hast thou a token to me from sir william
douglas said the lady
 i have madam replied he but it
must be said in private
thou art right said the lady moving
towards the recess a window say in
what does it consist 
 in the words an old bard replied
the abbot
 repeat them answered the lady and
he uttered in a low tone the lines from an
old poem called the howlet 
o douglas douglas
tender and true
 trusty sir john holland i said the
lady douglas apostrophizing the poet
 the abbot
a kinder heart never inspired a rhine
and the douglas's honour was ever on thy
harp string we receive you among our
followers glendinning but randal see
that he keep the after ward only till we
shall hear more touching him from our son
thou dearest not the nightair blending

 in the cause the lady before whom
i stand i fear nothing madam answered
the disguised abbot
 our garrison then is stronger by one
trust worthy soldiers said the matron 
go to the buttery and let them make
much thee
when the lady lochleven had retired
the queen said to roland graeme who was
now almost constantly in her company i
spy comfort in that stranger's countenance y
i know not why it should be so but i am
well persuaded he is a friend
 your grace's penetration does not deceive
you answered the page and he informed
her that the abbot saint mary's
the abbot s
himself played the part the newly arrived
soldier
the queen crossed herself and looked
upwards unworthy sinner that i am
she said that for my sake a man so holy
and so high in spiritual office should wear
the garb a base shorter and run the risk
 dying the death a traitor 
 heaven will protect its own servant
madam said catherine seyton his aid
would bring a blessing on our undertaking
were it not already blest for its own sake
 what i admire in my spiritual father
said roland was the steady front with
which he looked on me without giving the
least sign former acquaintance i did
not think the like was possible since i have
ceased to believe that henry was the same
person with catherine
 but marked you not how studiously
the good father said the queen eluded
the questions the woman lochleven telling
her the very truth which yet she received
not as such 
t the abbot
roland thought in his heart that when
the truth was spoken for the purpose deceiving
it was little better than a lie in disguise
but it was no time to agitate such
questions conscience
and now for the signal from the shore
exclaimed catherine my bosom tells me
we shall see this night two lights instead 
one gleam from that garden eden and
then roland do you play your part manfully
and we will dance on the greensward
like midnight fairies 
catherine's conjecture misgave not nor
deceived her in the evening two beams
twinkled from the cottage instead one 
and the page heard with beating heart that
the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel
on the outside the castle when
he intimated this news to the queen she
held her hand out to him he knelt and
when he raised it to his lips in all dutiful
homage he found it was damp and cold as
marble for god's sake madam droop
not now sink not now
the abbot 
 call upon our lady my liege said
the lady flemings call upon your tutelar
saint
 call the spirits the hundred kings
you are descended from exclaimed the
page in this hour need the resolution
 a monarch were worth the aid a hundred
saints
o roland grseme said mary in a
tone deep despondency be true tome
 many have been false to me alas i
have not always been true to myself my
mind misgives me that i shall die in bondage
and that this bold attempt will cost
all our lives it was foretold me by a soothsayer
in france that i should die in prison
and by a violent death and here comes the
hour o would to god it found me prepared

 madam said catherine seyton remember
you are a queen better we all
died in bravely attempting to gain our freedom
than remained here to be poisoned as
 the abbot
men rid them the noxious vermin that
haunt old houses
 you are right catherine said the
queen and mary will bear her like herself
but alas your young and buoyant
spirit can ill spell the causes which have
broken mine forgive me my children
and farewell for a while i will prepare
both mind and body for this awful venture

they separated till again called together
by the tolling the curfew the queen
appeared grave but firm and resolved the
lady fleming with the art an experienced
courtier knew perfectly how to disguise
her inward tremors catherine's eye
was fired as if with the boldness the project
and the half smile which dwelt upon
her beautiful mouth seemed to contemn all
the risk and all the consequences discovery
 roland who felt how much success
depended on his own address and boldness
summoned together his whole pre
the abbot st
sence mind and if he found his spirits
flag for a moment cast his eye upon catherine
whom he thought he had never
seen look so beautiful i may be foiled
he thought but with this reward in prospect
they must bring the devil to aid them
ere they cross me thus resolved he stood
like a greyhound in the slips with hand
heart eye intent upon making and seizing
opportunity for the execution their project

the keys had with the wonted ceremonial
been presented to the lady cochlea
she stood with her back to the casement
which like that the queen's apartment
commanded a view kinross with
the church which stands at some distance
fiom the town and nearer to the lake
then connected with the town by straggling
cottages with her back to this casement
then and her face to the table on
which the keys lay for an instant while she
tasted the various dishes which were placed
 the abbot
there stood the lady lochleven more
provokingly intent than usual so at least
it seemed to her prisoners upon the huge
and heavy bunch iron the implements 
their restraint just when having finished
her ceremony as taster the queen's table
she was about to take up the keys the
page who stood beside her and had handed
her the dishes in succession looked sideways
to the churchyard and exclaimed he
saw corpse candles in the churchyard the
lady lochleven was not without a touch
though a slight one the superstitions 
the time the fate her sons made her
alive to omens and a corpselight as it was
called in the family burialplace boded
death she turned her head towards the
casement saw a distant glimmering forgot
her charge for one second and in that
second were lost the whole fruits her
former vigilance the page held the forged
keys under his cloak and with great dexterity
exchanged them for the real ones
his utmost address could not prevent a
the abbot 
slight clash as he took up the latter bunch
who touches the keys said the lady 
and while the page answered that the sleeve
 his cloak had stirred them she looked
round possessed herself the bunch which
now occupied the place the genuine keys
and again turned to gaze at the supposed
corpsecandles
i hold these gleams she said after a
moment's consideration to come not
from the churchyard but from the hut 
the old gardener blinkhoolie i wonder
what thrift that churl drives that late he
hath ever had light in his house till the
night grew deep i thought him an industrious
peaceful man if he turns resented
 idle companions and nightwalkers
the place must be rid him
 he may work his baskets perchance
said the page desirous to stop the train 
her suspicion
or nets may he not answered the
lady
 the abbot
ay madam said roland for trout
and salmon
 or for fools and knaves replied the
lady but this shall be looked after tomorrow
i wish your grace and your company
a good evening randal attend us
and randal who waited in the antichamber
after having surrendered his bunch 
keys gave his escort to his mistress as usual
while leaving the queen's apartments she
retired to her own
tomorrow said the page rubbing
his hands with glee as he repeated the lady's
last words fools look to tomorrow and
wise folk use tonight may i pray you
my gracious liege to retire for one half
hour until all the castle is composed to rest
i must go and rub with oil these blessed
implements our freedom courage and
constancy and all will go well providing
our friends on the shore fail not to send the
boat you spoke 
 fear them not said catherine they
the abbot 
are true as steel if our dear mistress do
but maintain her noble and royal courage
doubt not me catherine replied the
queen a while since i was overborne
but i have recalled the spirit my earlier
and more sprightly days when i used to
accompany my armed nobles and wish to
be myself a man to know what life it was
to be in the fields with sword and buckler
jack and knapsack
 o the lark lives not a gayer life nor
sings a lighter and gayer song than the
merry soldier answered catherine your
jrace shall be in the midst them soon
and the look such a liege sovereign will
make each your host worth three in the
hour need but i must to my task
 we have but brief time said queen
mary one the two lights in the cottage
is extinguished that shows the boat is put
off
they will row very slow said the
page or kent where depth permits to
is
 the abbot
avoid noise to our several gear i will
communicate with the good father
at the dead hour midnight when all
was silent in the castle the page put the
key into the lock the wicket which opened
into the garden and which was at the
bottom a staircase that descended from
the queen's apartment now turn smooth
and softly thou good bolt said he if
ever oil softened rust and his precautions
had been so effectual that the bolt revolved
with little or no sound resistance he
ventured not to cross the threshold but exchanging
a word with the disguised abbot
asked if the boat were ready
this half hour said the sentinel she
lies beneath the wall too close under the
islet to be seen by the warder but i fear
she will hardly escape his notice in putting
off again
the darkness said the page and
our profound silence may take her off unobserved
as she came in hildebrand has
the abbot 
the watch on the tower a heavyheaded
knave who holds a can ale to be the best
headpiece upon a nightwatch he sleeps
for a wager
 then bring the queen said the abbot
and i will call henry seyton to assist
them to the boat
on tiptoe with noiseless step and suppressed
breath trembling at every rustle 
their own apparel one after another the fair
prisoners glided down the winding stair
under the guidance roland grime and
were received at the wicketgate by henry
seyton and the churchman the former
seemed instantly to take upon himself the
whole direction the enterprize my
lord abbot he said give my sister your
armi will conduct the queensland the
youth will have the honour to guide lady
fleming
this was no time to dispute the arrangement
although it was not that which roland
graeme would have chosen catherine
seyton who well knew the garden path
 the abbot
tripped on before like a sylph rather leading
the abbot than receiving assistance 
the queen her native spirit prevailing over
female fear and a thousand painful reflections
moved steadily forward by assistance
 henry seyton while the lady fleming
encumbered with her fears and her helplessness
roland graeme who followed in the
rear and who bore under the other arm a
packet necessaries belonging to the queen
the door the garden which communicated
with the shore the islet yielded to one
 the keys which roland had possessed
himself although not until he had tried several
 a moment anxious terror and expectation
the ladies were then partly led
partly carried to the side the lake where a
boat with six rowers attended them the men
couched along the bottom to secure them
from observation henry seyton placed
the queen in the stern the abbot offered
to assist catherine but she was seated by
the queen's side before he could utter his
proffer help j and roland graeme was
the abbot 
just lifting lady fleming over the boatside
when a thought suddenly occurred to
him and exclaiming forgotten forgotten
 wait me but one half minute he replaced
on the shore the helpless lady the
bedchamber threw the queen's packet into
the boat and sped back through the garden
with the noiseless speed a bird on the
wing
 by heaven he is false at last said
seyton i ever feared it 
 he is as true said catherine as
heaven itself and that i will maintain
 be silent minion said her brother
for shame if not for fear fellows put off
and row for your lives
help me help me on board i said the
deserted lady fleming and that louder
than prudence warranted
put off put off cried henry seyton 
leave all behind so the queen is safe
will you permit this madam said
catherine imploringly you leave your
deliverer to death
vol ni m
 the abbot
i will not said the queen seton
i command you to stay at every risk
 pardon me madam if i disobey said
the intractable young man and with one
hand lifting in lady fleming he begun
himself to push off the boat
she was two fathoms length from the
shore and the rowers were getting her
head round when roland graeme arriving
bounded from the beach and attained the
boat overturning seyton on whom he
lighted the youth swore a deep but suppressed
oath and stopping grseme as he
stepped towards the stern said your
place is not with highborn dames keep at
the head and trim the vessel now give
way give way row for god and the
queen 
the rowers obeyed and began to puh
vigorously
why did ye not muffle the oars said
island graeme the dash must awaken
the sentinel row lads and get out 
shot for had not old hildebrand the warthe
abbot 
dep supped upon poppyporridge this
whispering must have waked him
 it was all thine own delay said seyton
 thou shalt reckon with me hereafter
for that and other matters
but roland's apprehension was verified
too instantly to permit him to reply the
dentine whose slumbering had withstood
the whispering was alarmed by the dash 
the oars his challenge was instantly
heard a boat a boat bring to or i
shoot and as they continued to ply their
oar he called aloud treason treason 
rung the bell the castle and discharged
his marquess at the boat the ladies
crowded on each other like startled wildfowl
at the flash and report the piece
while the men urged the rowers to the utmost
speed they heard more than one
ball whiz along the surface the lake at
no great distance from their httle bark and
from the lights which glanced like meteors
from window to window it was evident
 the abbot
the whole castle was alarmed and their escape
discovered
pull again exclaimed seyton stretch
to your oars or i will spur you to the task
with my dagger they will launch a boat
immediately
that is cared for said roland i
locked gate and wicket on them when i
went back and no boat will stir from the
island this night if doors good oak and
bolts iron can keep men within stonewalls
 and now i resign my office 
porter lochleven and give the keys to
the kelpie's keeping
as the heavy keys plunged in the lake
the abbot who till then had been repeating
his prayers exclaimed now bless
thee my son for thy ready prudence puts
shame on us all
 knew said mary drawing her breath
more freely as they were now out reach
 the musketry knew my squire's
truth promptitude and sagacity i must
the abbot 
have him dear friends with my no less
true knights douglas and seaton but
where then is douglas 
 here madam answered the deep and
melancholy voice the boatman who sate
next her and who acted as steersman
alas was it you who stretched your
body before me said the queen when
the balls were raining around us 
 believe you said he in a low tone
that douglas would have resigned to anyone
the chance protecting his queen's
life with his own
the dialogue was here interrupted by a
shot or two from one those small pieces
 artillery called falconets then used in
defending castles the shot was too vague
to have any effect but the broader flash
the deeper sound the louder return which
was made by the midnight echoes benparty
terrified and imposed silence on the
liberated prisoners the boat was alongside
 a rude quay or landing place running
out from a garden considerable 
the abbot
tent ere any them again attempted to
speak they landed and while the abbot
returned thanks aloud to heaven which
had thus far favoured their enterprise douglas
enjoyed the best reward his desperate
undertaking in conducting the queen
to the house the gardener yet not unmindful
 roland graeme even in that
moment terror and exhaustion mary
expressly commanded seyton to give his
assistance to fleming while catherine voluntarily
and without bidding took the arm
 the page seyton presently resigned
lady fleming to the care the abbot
alleging he must look after their horses 
and his attendants disencumbering themselves
 their boatcloaks hastened to assist
him
while mary spent in the gardener's cottage
the few minutes which were necessary
to prepare the steeds for their departure
she perceived in a corner the old man to
whom the garden belonged and called him
th abbot 
ta approach he came as it were with reluctance

 how brother said the abbot so slow
to welcome thy royal queen and mistress
to liberty and to her kingdom 
the old man thus admonished came forward
and in good terms speech gave
her grace joy her deliverance the
queen returned him thanks in the most
gracious manner and added it will remain
to us to after some immediate reward
for your fidelity for we wot well your hous
has been long the refuge in which our trusty
servants have met to concert measures for
our freedom so saying she offered gold
and added we will consider your services
more fully hereafter
kneel brother said the abbot kneel
instantly and thank her grace's kindness
 good brother that wert once a few
steps under me and art still many years
younger replied the gardener pettishly
 let me do mine acknowledgments in my
own way queens have knelt to me ere
 the abbot
now and in truth my knees are too old and
stiff to bend even to this lovelyfaced lady
may it please your grace if your grace's
servants have occupied my house so that i
could not call it mine own if they have
trodden down my flowers in the zeal 
their midnight comings and goings and destroyed
the hope the fruit season by
bringing their warhorses into my garden i
do but crave your grace in requital
that you will chuse your residence as far
from me as possible i am an old man
who would willingly creep to my grave as
easily as he can in peace good will and
quiet labour
 and
with whom art thou brawling unless my
n
 the abbot
eyes spell that token false it is with the
very youth who aided me so gallantly in
the skirmish with the leslie let me look
fair youth at the medal which thou dearest
in thy cap by saint bennet it is the
same henry i command thee to forbear
him as thou lowest my blessing
and as you honour my command said
the queen good service hath he done
me
ay madam replied young seyton
as when he carried the billet inclosed in
the swordsheath to lochleven marry the
good youth knew no more than a packhorse
what he was carrying
but i who dedicated him to this great
work said magdalen grasme i by
whose advice and agency this just heir hath
been unloosed from her thraldom i who
spared not the last remaining hope a falling
house in this great action i at least
knew and counselled and what merit maybe
mine let the reward most gracious
queen descend upon this youth my mithe
abbot 
ministry here is ended you are free a sovereign
princess at the head a gallant
army surrounded by valiant barons my
service could avail you no farther but
might well prejudice you your fortune
now rests upon men's hearts and men's
swords may they prove as trusty as the
faith women 
you will not leave us mother said
the queen you whose practices in our
favour were so powerful who dared so
many dangers and wore so many disguises
to blind our enemies and to confirm our
friends you will not leave us in the dawn
 our reviving fortunes ere we have time
to know and to thank you 
you cannot know her answered magdalen
greene who knows not herself 
there are times when in this woman's frame
 mine there is the strength him 
gath in this overtoiled brain the wisdom
 the most sage counsellor and again the
mist is on me and my strength is veak
 the abbot
ness my wisdom folly i have spoken before
princes and cardinals ay noble princess
even before the princes thine own
house lorraine and i know not whence
the words persuasion came which flowed
from my lips and were drunk in by
their ears and now even when i most
need words persuasion there is something
which choaks my voice and robs me
 utterance
if there be aught in my power to do
thee pleasure said the queen the barely
naming it shall avail as well as all thine
eloquence
 sovereign lady replied the enthusiast
 it shames me that at this high moment
something human frailty should
cling to one whose vows the saints have
heard whose labours in the rightful cause
heaven has prospered but it will be thus
while the living spirit is shrine in the clay
 mortality i will yield to the folly she
said weeping as she spoke and it shall
the abbot 
be the last then seizing roland's hand
she led him to the queen's feet kneeling
herself upon one knee and causing him to
kneel on both mighty princess she
said look on this flower it was found
by a kindly stranger on a bloody field 
battle and long it was ere my anxious eyes
saw and my arms pressed all that was left
 my only daughter for your sake and
for that the holy faith we both profess
i could leave this plant while it was yet
tender to the nurture strangers ay
 enemies to whom perchance his blood
would have been as wine had the heretic
glendinning known that he had in his
house the heir julian avenel since
then i have seen him only in a few hours
 doubt and dread and now i part with
the child my love for ever for ever 
o for every weary step i have made in
your rightful cause in this and in foreign
lands give protection to the child whom i
must no more call mine 
 the abbot
i swear to you mother said the
queen deeply affected that for your
sake and his own his happiness and fortunes
shall be our charge 
i thank you daughter princes said
magdalen and pressed her lips first to the
queen's hand then to the brow her
grandson and now she said drying
her tears and rising with dignity earth
has had its own and heaven claims the
rest lioness scotland go forth and
conquer and if the prayers a devoted
votaress can avail thee they will rise in
many a land and from many a distant
shrine i will glide like a ghost from land
to land from temple to temple and where
the very name my country is unknown
the priests shall ask who is the queen 
that distant northern land for whom the
aged pilgrim was so fervent in prayer farewell
 honour be thine and earthly prosperity
if it be the will god if not may
the penance thou shalt do here ensure thee
the abbot 
happiness hereafter let no one speak or
follow me my resolution is taken my
vow cannot be cancelled
she glided from their presence as she
spoke and her last look was upon her beloved
grandchild he would have risen
and followed but the queen and lord
seyton interfered
press not on her now said lord seyton
 if you would not lose her for ever
many a time have we seen the sainted mother
and often at the most needful moment
 but to press on her privacy or to
thwart her purpose is a crime which she
cannot pardon i trust we shall yet see herat
her need a holy woman she is for certain
and dedicated wholly to prayer and
penance and hence the heretics hold her
as distracted while catholics deem her a
saint
let me then hope said the queen
that you my lord will aid me in the execution
 her last request
 the abbot
what in the protection my young
second cheerfully that is in all that your
majesty can think it fitting to ask me 
henry give thy hand ripon the instant to
roland avenel for so i presume he must
now be called
and shall be lord the barony
said the queen if god prosper our rightful
arms
it can only be to restore it to my kind
protectress who now holds it said young
avenel i would rather be landless all
my life than she lost a rood ground by
me
nay said the queen looking to lord
seyton his mind matches his birth 
henry thou hast not yet given thy hand
it is his said henry giving it with
some appearance courtesy but whispering
roland at the same time for all
this thou hast not my sister's
may it please your grace said lord
seyton now that these passages are over
the abbot 
to honour our poor meal time it were
that our banners were reflected in the
clyde we must to horse with as little
stop as may be
 the abbot
chapter x
ay sir our ancient crown in these wild times
oft stood upon a cast the gamester's ducat
so often staked and lost and then regain'd
scarce knew so many hazards
the spanish father
it is not our object to enter into the historical
part the reign the illfated mary
or to recount how during the week which
succeeded her flight from lochleven her
partizans mustered around her with their
followers forming a gallant army amounting
to six thousand men so much light
has been lately thrown on the most minute
details the period by mr chalmers in his
valuable history queen mary that the
reader may be safely referred to it for the
most full information which ancient records
afford concerning that interesting time it
the abbot 
is sufficient for our purpose to say that
while mary's headquarters were at hamilton
the regent and his adherents had in
the king's name assembled a host at glasgow
inferior indeed to that the queen
in numbers but formidable from the military
talents murray morton the laird
 grange and others who had been trained
from their youth in foreign and domestic
wars
in these circumstances it was the obvious
policy queen mary to avoid a conflict
secure that were her person once in
safety the number her adherents must
daily increase whereas the forces those
opposed to her must as had frequentlyhap
opened in the previous history her reign
have diminished and their spirits become
broken and so evident was this to her
counsellors that they resolved their first
step should be to place the queen in the
strong castle dumbarton there to await
the course events the arrival succours
from france and the levies which
a the abbot
were made by her adherents in every province
 scotland accordingly orders
were given that all men should be on horseback
or on foot apparelled in their armour
and ready to follow the queen's standard
in array battle the avowed determination
being to escort her to the castle 
dumbarton in defiance her enemies
the muster was made upon hamiltonmoor
and rhe march commenced in all the
pomp feudal times military music sounded
banners and pennons waved armour
glittered far and wide and spears glanced
and twinkled like stars in a frosty sky the
gallant spectacle warlike parade was ou
this occasion dignified by the presence 
the queen herself who with a fair retinue
 ladies and household attendants and a
special guard gentlemen amongst whom
young seyton and roland were distinguished
gave grace at once and confidence to
the army which spread its ample filesbefore
around and behind her many churchmen
also joined the cavalcade most whom did
the abbot 
not scruple to assume arms and declare
their intention wielding them in defence
 mary and the catholic faith not so the
abbot saint mary's roland lead not
seen this prelate since the night their
escape from lochleven and he now beheld
him robed in the dress his order assume
his station near the queen's person roland
hastened to pull off his basket and beseech
the abbot's blessing
thou hast it my son said the priest 
i see thee now under thy true name and
in thy rightful garb the helmet with the
holly branch befits your brows well i have
long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume
it
 then you knew my descent my
good father said roland
 i did so but it was under seal confession
from thy grandmother nor was i
at liberty to tell the secret till she herself
should make it known
 her reason for such secrecy my father
 said roland avenel
 the abbot
 fear perchance my brother amistaken
fear for halbert would not to ensure
himself a kingdom wrong an orphan j
besides that your title in quiet times even
had your father done your mother that justice
which i well hope he did could not
have competed with that my brother's
wife the child julian's elder brother
they need fear no competition from
mesaidavenel scotland is wide enough
and there are many manors to win without
plundering my benefactor but prove tome
my reverend father that my father was
just to my mother shew me that i may
call myself a legitimate avenel and make
me your bounden slave for ever
 ay replied the abbot i hear the
seytons hold thee cheap for that stain on
thy shield something however i have
learnt from the late abbot boniface which
if it prove sooth may redeem that reproach

tell me that blessed news said roland
 and the future service my life
the abbot 
rash boy said the abbot i should
but madden thine impatient temper by exciting
hopes that may never be fulfilled 
and is this a time for them think on what
perilous march we are bound and if thou
hast a sin unconfessed neglect not the only
leisure which heaven may perchance afford
thee for confession and absolution
there will be time enough for both i
trust when we reach dumbarton answered
the page
ay said the abbot thou lowest
as loudly as the rest but we are not yet at
dumbarton and there is a lion in the path
mean you murray morton and the
other rebels at glasgow my reverend father
tush they dare not look on the royal
banner
even so replied the abbot speak
many those who are wiser than thou i
have returned from the southern shires
where i left many a chief name arming
in the queen's interest i left the lords
 the abbot
here wise and considerate men i find them
madmen on my return they are willing for
mere pride and vain glory to brave the
enemy and to carry the queen as it were
in triumph past the walls glasgow and
under the beards the adverse army 
seldom does heaven smile on such mistimed
confidence we shall be encountered
and that to the purpose
 and so much the better replied roland
 the field battle was my cradle
 beware it be not thy dyingbed said
the abbot but what avails it whispering
to young wolves the dangers the chace 
you will know perchance ere this day is
out what yonder men are whom you hold
in rash contempt
why what are they said henry seyton
who now joined them have they sinews
 wire and flesh iron will lead
pierce and steel cut them if so reverent
father we have little to fear
they are evil men said the abbot
the abbot s
but the trade war demands no saints
murray and morton are known to be the
best generals in scotland no one ever saw
lindsay or ruthven's back kirkaldy 
grange was named by the constable montmorency
the first soldier in europe my
brother too good a name for such a cause
has been far and wide known for a soldier
 the better the better said seyton
triumphantly we shall have all these traitors
 rank and name in a fair field before
us our cause is the best our numbers are
the strongest our hearts and limbs match
theirs saint bennet and set on 
the abbot made no reply but seemed
lost in reflection and his anxiety in some
measure communicated itself to roland
avenel who ever as their line march led
over a ridge or an eminence cast an anxious
look towards the towers glasgow as
if he expected to see symptoms the enemy
issuing forth it was not that he feared
the fight but the issue was such deep
vol iii o
 the abbot
import to his country and to himself that
the natural fire his spirit burned with a
less lively though with a more intense glow
love honour fame fortune all seemed to
depend on the issue one field rashly hazarded
perhaps but now likely to become
unavoidable
when at length their march came to be
nearly parallel with the city glasgow
roland became sensible that the high
grounds before them were already in part
occupied by a force shewing like their own
the royal banner scotland and on the
point being supported by columns infantry
and squadrons horse which the
city gates had poured forth and which hastily
advanced to sustain those troops who
already possessed the ground in front the
queen's army horseman after horseman
galloped in from the advanced guard with
tidings that murray had taken the field
with his whole army that his object was to
intercept the queen's march and his purpose
unquestionable to hazard a battle it
the abbot 
was now that the tempers men were subjected
to a sudden and a severe trial and
that those who had too presumptuously concluded
that they would pass without combat
were something disconcerted when at
once and with little time to deliberate
they found themselves placed in front a
resolute enemy their chiefs immediately
assembled around the queen and held a
hasty council war mary's quivering lip
confessed the fear which she endeavoured
to conceal under a bold and dignified demeanour
but her efforts were overcome
by painful recollections the disastrous
issue her last appearance in arras at 
 and when she meant to have
asked them their advice for ordering the
battle she involuntarily enquired whether
there were no means escaping without
an engagement
 escaping answered the lord seyton
 when i stand as one to ten your highness's
enemies i may think escape but
never while i stand with three to two
 the abbot
battle battle exclaimed the assembled
lords we will drive the rebels from
their vantage ground as the hound turns
the hare on the hill side
 methinks my noble lords said the
abbot it were as well to prevent his
gaining that advantage our road lies
through yonder hamlet on the brow and
whichever party hath the luck to possess
it with its little gardens and enclosures
will attain a post great defence
the reverend father is right said the
queen o haste thee seyton haste and
get thither before them they are marching
like the wind
seyton bowed low and turned his horse's
head your highness honours me he
said i will instantly press forward and
seize the pass
 not before me my lord whose charge
is the command the van guard said
the lord arbroath
before you or any hamilton in scotthe
abbot 
land said the ssy ton having the q been's
command follow me gentlemen my vassals
and kinsmen saint bennet and seton
i
and follow me said arbroath my
noble kinsmen and brave mentenants we
will see which will first reach the post 
danger for god and queen mary 
illomened haste and most unhappy
strife said the abbot who saw them and
their followers rush hastily and emulously
to ascend the height without waiting till
their men were placed in order and
you gentlemen he continued addressing
roland and seyton who were each
about to follow those who hastened thus disorderly
to the conflict will you leave the
queen's person unguarded 
o leave me not gentlemen said the
queen roland and seyton do not leave
me there are enough arms to strike in
this fell combat withdraw not those to
whom i trust for my safety
s the abbot
we may not leave her grace said roland
looking at seyton and turning his
horse
 i ever looked when thou wouldst find
out that rejoined the fiery youth
roland made no answer but bit his lip
till the blood came and spurring his horse
up to the side catherine sey ton's palfrey
he whispered in a low voice i never
thought to have done aught to deserve you 
but this day i have heard myself upbraided
with cowardice and my sword remained
still sheathed and all for the love you
there is madness among us all said
the damsel my father my brother and
you are all alike bereft reason ye should
think only this poor queen and you are
all inspired by your own absurd jealousies
the monk is the only soldier and man
 sense amongst you all my lord abbot
she cried aloud were it not better
we should draw to the westward and wait
the event that god shall send us instead
 remaining here in the highway endan
the abbot 
gearing the queen's person and cumbering
the troops in their advance 
you say well my daughter replied the
abbot had we but one to guide us where
the queen's person may be in safety our
nobles hurry to the conflict without casting
a thought on the very cause the
war
follow me said a knight or manatarms
well mounted and attired completely
in black armour but having the visor 
his helmet closed and bearing no crest on
his helmet or device upon his shield
 we will follow no stranger said the
abbot without some warrant his
truth
 i am a stranger and in your hands
said the horseman if you wish to know
more me the queen herself will be your
warrant
the queen had remained fixed to the
spot as if disabled by fear yet mechanically
smiang bowing and waving her hand
 the abba
as banners were lowered and spears depressed
before her while emulating the strife
betwixt seyton and arbroath band on band
pressed forward their march towards the
enemy scarce however had the black
rider whispered something in her ear than
she assented to what he said and when
he spoke aloud and with an air command
 gentlemen it is the queen's pleasure
that you should follow me mary uttered
with something like eagerness the
word yes
all were in motion in an instant for the
black horseman throwing off a sort apathy
 manner which his first appearance indicated
spurred his horse to and fro making
him take such active bounds and short turns
as shewed the rider master the animal 
and getting thequeen's little retinue some
order for marching he led them to the left
directing his course towards a castle which
crowning a gentle yet commanding eminence
presented an extensive view over
the abbot 
the country beneath and in particular
commanded a view those heights which
both armies hastened to occupy and which
it was now apparent must almost instantly
be the scene struggle and dispute
yonder towers said the abbot questioning
the sable horseman to whom do
they belong and are they now in the
hands friends
they are untenanted replied the
stranger or at least they have no hostile
inmates but urge these youths sir abbot
to make more haste this is but an
evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity by
peering out upon the battle in which they
are to take no share
 the worse luck mine said henry
seyton who overheard him i would rather
be under my father's banner at this
moment than be made chamberlain 
for this my present duty peaceful
ward well and patiently discharged
your place under your father's banner
o 
 the abbot
will shortly be right dangerous said roland
avenel who pressing his horse towards
the westward had still his look reverted
to the armies for i see yonder
body cavalry which presses from the
eastward will reach the village ere lord
seyton can gain it
they are but cavalry said seyton
looking attentively they cannot hold the
village without shot marquess
look more closely said roland you
will see that each these horsemen who
advance so rapidly from glasgow carries a
a footman behind him
now by heaven he speaks well said
the black cavalier one you two must
go carry the news to lord seyton and lord
arbroath that they hasten not their horsemen
on before the foot but advance more
regularly
be that my errand said roland for
i first marked the stratagem the enemy
but by your leave said seyton
the abbot 
yonder is my father's banner engaged
and it best becomes me to go to the rescue
i will stand by the queen's decision
said roland avenel
what new appeal what new quarrel 
said queen mary are there not in yonder
dark host enemies enough to mary
stuart but must her very friends turn enemies
to each other 
nay madam said roland the young
master seyton and i did but dispute
who should leave your person to do a most
needful message to the host he thought
his rank entitled him and i deemed that
the person least consequence being myself
were better perilled
not so said the queen if one
must leave me be it seyton
henry seyton bowed till the white plumes
on his helmet mixed with the flowing mane
 his gallant warhorse then placed himself
firm in the saddle shook his lance aloft
with an air triumph and determination
and striking his horse with the spurs made
s the abbot
towards his father's banner which was still
advancing up the hill and dashed his steed
over every obstacle that occurred in his
headlong path
my brother my father exclaimed
catherine with an expression agonized
apprehension they are in the midst 
peril and i in safety 
would to god said roland that i
were with them and could ransom every
drop their blood by two mine i
do i not know thou dost wish it
said catherine can a woman say to a
man what i have well nigh said to thee
and yet think that he could harbour fear
or faintness heart there is that in
yon distant sound approaching battle
that pleases me even while it affright me
i would i were a man that i might feel
that stern delight without the mixture 
terror i
ride up ride up lady catherine seyton
cried the abbot as they still swept
on at a rapid pace and were now close bethe
abbot 
neath the walls the castle ride up
and aid lady fleming to support the queen
she gives way more and more
they halted and lifted mary from the
saddle and were about to support her towards
the castle when she said faintly
 not there not there these walls will i
never enter more 
be a queen madam said the abbot
and forget that you are a woman
o i must forget much much more answered
the unfortunate mary in an undertone
 ere i can look with steady eyes on
these wellknown scenes i must forget the
days which i spent here as the bride the
lost the murthered 
 thesis the castle crookstone said
the lady fleming in which the queen
held her first court after she was married
to darnley
heaven said the abbot thy hand
is upon us bear yet up madam your
foes are the foes holy church and god
 the abbot
will this day decide whether scotland shall
be catholic or heretic
a heavy and continued fire cannon
and musketry bore a tremendous burthen
to his words and seemed far more than
they to recal the spirits the queen 
to yonder tree she said pointing to
a yew tree which grew on a small mount
close to the castle i know it well 
from thence you may see a prospect wide
as from the peaks schehallion
and freeing herself from her assistants
she walked with a determined yet somewhat
wild step up to the stem the noble
yew the abbot catherine and roland
avenel followed her while lady fleming
kept back the inferior persons her train
the black horseman also followed the
queen waiting on her as closely as the
shadow upon the light but ever remaining
at the distance two or three yards he
folded his arms on his bosom turned his
back to the battle and seemed solely occur
abbot 
pied by gazing on mary through the bars
 his closed vizor the queen regarded
him not but fixed her eyes upon the spreading
yew
 ay fair and stately tree she said as
if at the sight it she had been rapt away
from the present scene and had overcome
the horror which had oppressed her at the
first approach to crookstone there thou
stances gay and goodly as ever though
thou hearest the sounds war instead 
the vows love all is gone since i last
greeted thee love and lover vows and
vower king and kingdom how goes the
field my lord abbot with us i trustyet
what but evil can mary's eyes witness
from this spot i
her attendants eagerly bent their eyes
on the field battle but could discover
nothing more than that it was obstinately
debated the small inclosures and cottage
gardens in the village vhich they had a
full and commanding view and which lately
lay with their lines sycamore and ashsis
the abbot
trees so still and quiet in the mild light 
a may sun were now each converted into
a line fire canopied by smoke and the
sustained and constant report the musketry
and cannon mingled with the shouts
 the meeting combatants shewed that as
yet neither party had given ground
 many a soul finds its final departure to
heaven or hell in these awful thunders
said the abbot let those that believe in
the holy church join me in orisons for
victory in this dreadful combat
 not here not here said the unfortunate
queen pray not here father or
pray in silence my mind is too much torn
between the past and the present to dare
to approach the heavenly throne or if ye
will pray be it for one whose fondest affections
have been her greatest crimes and
who has ceased to be a queen only because
she was a deceived and a tenderhearted
woman
were it not well said roland that
the abbot 
i rode somewhat nearer the hosts and saw
the fate the day 
 do so in the name god said the
abbot for if our friends are scattered
our flight must be hasty but beware thou
approach not too nigh the conflict there is
more than thine own life depends on thy
safe return
 o go not too nigh said catherine j
but fail not to see how the seytons fight
and how they bear themselves
 fear nothing i will be on my guard
said ronald avenel and without waiting
further answer rode towards the scene 
conflict keeping as he rode the higher
and uninclosed ground and ever looking
cautiously around him for fear involving
himself in some hostile party as he approached
the shots rung sharp and more
sharply on his ear the shouts came wilder
and wilder and he felt that thick beating
 the heart that mixture natural apprehension
intense curiosity and anxiety for
the dubious event which even the bravest
 the abbot
experience when they approach alone to a
scene interest and danger
at length he drew so close that from a
bank screened by bushes and underwood he
could distinctly see where the struggle was
most keenly maintained this was in a hollow
way leading to the village up which the
queen's vanguard had marched with more
hasty courage than well advised conduct
for the purpose possessing themselves 
that post vantage but they found the
hedges and inclosures already occupied by
the enemy led by the celebrated kirkcaldy
 grange and the earl morton and
not small was the loss which they sustained
while struggling forward to come to close
with the menatarms on the other side
but as the queen's followers were chiefly
noblemen and barons with their kinsmen
and followers they had pressed onwards
contemning obstacles and danger and had
when roland arrived on the ground met
hand to hand at the gorge the pass with
the regent's vanguard and endeavoured to
the abbot 
bear them out the village at the spearpoint
 while their foes equally determined
to keep the advantage which they had attained
struggled with the like obstinacy to
drive back the assailants
both parties were on foot and armed in
proof so that when the long lances the
front ranks were fixed in each other's shields
corslet and breastplates the struggle resembled
that two bulls who fixing their
frontlets hard against each other remain in
that posture for hours until the superior
strength or obstinacy the one compels
the other to take to flight or bears him
down to the earth thus locked together
in the deadly struggle which swayed slowly
to and fro as one or other party gained
the advantage those who fell were trampled
on alike by friends and foes those whose
weapons were broken retired from the front
rank and had their place supplied by others 
while the rearward ranks unable otherwise
to take share in the combat fired their 
the abbot
told and hurled their daggers and the
points and truncheons the broken weapons
like javelins against the enemy
 god and the queen resounded from
the one party god and the king thundered
from the other while in the name 
their sovereign fellowsubjects shed each
other's blood and in the name their
creator defaced his image amid the tumult
was often heard the voices the captains
shouting their commands leaders
and chiefs crying their gathering words j
 groans and shrieks from the falling and
the dying
the strife had lasted nearly an hour the
strength both parties seemed exhausted
but their rage was unabated and their obstinacy
unsubdued when roland who
turned eye and ear to all around him saw
a column infantry headed by a few horsemen
wheel round the base the bank
where he had stationed himself and levelling
their long lances attack the flank 
the abbot 
the queen's vanguard closely engaged as
they were with the conflict on their front
the very first glance shewed him that the
leader who directed this movement was
the knight avenel his ancient master
and the next convinced him that its effect
would be decisive the result the attack
 fresh and unbroken forces upon the
flank those already wearied with a long
and obstinate struggle was indeed instantaneous

the column the assailants which had
hitherto shewn one dark dense and united
line helmets surmounted with plumage
was at once broken and hurled in confusion
down the hill which they had so long endeavoured
to gain in vain were the leaders
heard calling upon their followers to stand
to the combat and seen personally resisting
when all resistance was evidently vain
they were slain or felled to the earth or
hurried backwards by the mingled tide 
flight and pursuit what were roland's
feelings on beholding the rout and feeling
 the abbot
that all that remained for him was to turn
bridle and endeavour to ensure the safety
 the queen's person yet keen as his
grief and shame might be they were both
forgotten when almost close beneath the
bank which he occupied he saw henry
seyton forced away from his own party in
the tumult covered with dust and blood
and defending himself desperately against
several the enemy who had gathered
around him attracted by his gay armour
roland paused not a moment but pushing
his steed down the bank leaped him amongst
the hostile party dealt three or four blows
amongst them which struck down two and
made the rest stand aloof then reaching
seyton his hand he exhorted him to seize
fast on his horse's mane
we live or die together this day said
he keep but fast hold till we are out 
the press and then my horse is yours
seyton heard and exerted his remaining
strength and by their joint efforts roland
brought him out danger and behind the
the abbot 
spot from whence he had witnessed the disastrous
conclusion the fight but no
sooner were they under shelter the trees
than seyton let go his hold and in spite 
roland's efforts to support him fell at length
on the turf trouble yourself no more
with me he said this is my first and my
last battle and i have already seen too
much it to wish to see the close hasten
to save the queen and commend me to
catherine she will never more be mistaken
for me nor i for her the last swordstroke
has made an eternal distinction
 let me aid you to mount my horse
said roland eagerly and you may yet
be saved i can find my own way on foot 
turn but my horse's head westward and he
will carry you fleet and easy as the wind
i will never mount steed more said
the youth farewell i love thee better
dying than ever thought to have done
while in life i would that old man's blood
were not on my hand sancti benedicite
 the abbot
ora pro me stand not to look on a dying
man but haste to save the queen
these words were spoken with the last
effort his voice and scarce were they
uttered ere the speaker was no more they
recalled roland to the sense the duty
which he had wellnigh forgotten but they
did not reach his ears only
the queen where is the queen 
said halbert glendinning who followed
by two or three horsemen appeared at this
instant roland made no answer but turning
his horse and confiding in his speed
gave him at once rein and spur and rode
over height and hollow towards the castle
 crookstone more heavily armed and
mounted upon a horse less speed sir
halbert glendinning followed with couched
lance calling out as he rode sir with
the hollybranch halt and shew your right
to bear that badge fly not thus cowardly
nor dishonour the cognizance thou deserves
not to wear halt sir coward or by heath
abbot 
even i will strike thee with my lance on the
back and slay thee like a dastard i am
the knight avenel i am halbert glendining

but roland who had no purpose encountering
his old master and who besides
knew the queen's safety depended on his
making the best speed he could answered
not a word to the defiances and reproaches
which sir halbert continued to throw out
against him but making the best use his
spurs rode yet harder than before and had
gained about a hundred yards upon his
pursuer when coming near to the yew tree
where he had left the queen he saw them
already getting to horse and cried out as
loud as he could foes foes ride for
if fair ladies brave gentlemen do your
devoir to protect them
so saying he wheeled his horse and
avoiding th shock sir halbert blending
charged one his folio wers who was
nearly on a line with him so rudely with
vol iii p
 the abbot
his lance that he overthrew horse and man
he then drew his sword and attacked the
second while the black manatarms throwing
himself in the way glendinning they
rushed on each other so fiercely that both
horses were overthrown and the riders lay
rolling on the plain neither was able to
arise for the black horseman was pierced
through with glendinning's lance and the
knight avenel oppressed with the
weight his own horse and sorely bruised
besides seemed in little better plight than
he whom he had mortally wounded
yield thee sir knight avenel rescue
or no rescue said roland who had
put a second antagonist out condition to
combat and hastened to prevent blending
from renewing the conflict
 may not chuse but yield said sir
halbert since i can no longer fight but
it shames me to speak such a word to a
coward like thee
call me not coward said roland
lifting his visor and helping his prisoner to
the abbot 
rise since but for old kindness at thy
hand and yet more at thy lady's i had
met thee as a brave man should
 the favourite page my wife said
sir halbert astonished ah wretched
boy i have heard thy treason at lochleven

reproach him not my brother said
the abbot he was but an agent in the
hands heaven
 to horse to horse said catherine
seyton mount and be gone or we are all
lost i see our gallant army flying for many
a league to horse my lord abbot to
horse roland my gracious liege to
horse ere this we should have ridden a
mile
 look on these features said mary
pointing to the dying knight who had been
unheeded by some compassionate hand 
 look there and tell me if she who ruins
all who love her ought to fly a foot farther
to save her wretched life
the reader must have long anticipated
 the abbot
the discovery which the queen's feelings
had made before her eyes confirmed it it
was the features the unhappy george
douglas on which death was stamping his
mark
 look look at him well said the
queen thus has it been with all who loved
mary stuart the royalty francis
the wit chaplet the power and gallantry
 the gay gordon the melody rizzio
the portly form and youthful grace darnley
the bold address and courtly manners
 bothwell and now the deepdevoted
passion the noble douglas nought could
save them they looked on the wretched
mary and to have loved her was crime
enough to deserve early death no sooner
had the victim formed a kind thought me
than the poisoned cup the axe and block
the dagger the mine were ready to punish
them for casting away affection on such a
wretch as i am importune me not i will
fly no farther i can die but once and i
will die here
the abbot 
while she spoke her tears fell fast on
the face the dying man who continued
to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness 
passion which death itself could hardly
subdue mourn not for me he said
faintly but care for your own safety i
die a douglas and i die pitied by mary
stuart i
he expired with these words and without
withdrawing his eyes from her face and
the queen whose heart was that soft
and gentle mould which in domestic life
and with a more suitable partner than darnley
might have made her happy remained
weeping by the dead man until recalled to
herself by the abbot who found it necessary
to use a style unusual remonstrance
 we also madam he said we your
grace's devoted followers have friends and
relatives to weep for i leave a brother in
eminent jeopardy the husband the lady
fleming the father and brothers the
lady catherine are all in yonder bloody
field slain it is to be feared or prisoners
 the abbot
we forget the fate our own nearest and
dearest to wait on our queen and she is
too much occupied with her own sorrows
to give one thought to ours
 i deserve not your reproach father
said the queen checking her tears but
i am docile to it where must we go 
what must we do 
 we must fly and that instantly said
the abbot whither is not so easily answered
but we may dispute it upon the
road lift her to her saddle and set forward

they set off accordingly roland lingered
a moment to command the attendants
 the knight avenel to the castle
 crookstone and to say that he demanded
from him no other condition liberty than
his word that he and his followers would
keep secret the direction in which the
queen fled as he turned his rein to depart
the honest countenance adam woodcock
stared upon him with an expression
 surprise which at another time would
the abbot 
have excited his hearty mirth he had
been one the followers who had experienced
the weight roland's arm and they
now knew each other roland having put
up his vizor and the good yeoman having
thrown away his barret cap with the iron
bars in front that he might the more readily
assist his master into this barretcap as
it lay on the ground roland forgot not
to drop a few gold pieces fruits the
queen's liberality and with a signal 
kind recollection and enduring friendship
he departed at full gallop to overtake the
queen the dust raised by her train being
already far down the hill
it is not fairymoney said honest
adam weighing and handling the gold 
and it is master roland himself that is
a certain thing the same open hand and
by our lady shrugging his shoulders
the same ready fist my lady will hear
 this gladly for she mourns for him as if
he were her son and to see how gay he
is but these light lads are as sure to be
 the abbot
uppermost as the froth to be on the top 
the quartpot your man solid parts remains
ever a falconer so saying he went
to aid his comrades who had now come up
in greater numbers to carry his master into
the castle crookstone
the abbot s
chapter xi
my native land good night
byron
many a bitter tear was shed during the
hasty flight queen mary over fallen
hopes future prospects and slaughtered
friends the deaths the brave douglas
and the fiery but gallant young seyton
seemed to affect the queen as much as the
fall from the throne on which she had so
nearly been again seated catherine seyton
devoured in secret her own grief anxious
to support the broken spirits her
mistress and the abbot bending his anxious
thoughts upon futurity endeavoured in
vain to form some plan which had a shadow
 hope the spirit young roland for
p
 the abbot
he also mingled in the hasty debates held
by the companions the queen's flight
continued unchecked and unbroken
your majesty he said has lost a battle
 your ancestor bruce lost seven successively
ere he sat triumphant on the
scottish throne and proclaimed with the
voice a victor in the field bannockburn
the independence his country are
not these heaths which we may traverse at
will better than the locked guarded and
lake moaned castle lochleven we are
free in that one word there is comfort for
all our losses
he struck a bold note but the heart 
mary made no response
 better she said i had still been in
lochleven than seen the slaughter made
by my rebels among the subjects who offered
themselves to death for my sake speak
not to me further efforts they would
only cost the lives you the friends who
recommend them i would not again unthe
abbot 
tergo what i felt when i saw from yonder
mount the swords the fell horsemen 
morton raging among the faithful seytons
and hamiltons for their loyalty to their
queen i would not again feel what i felt
when douglas's lifeblood stained my mantle
for his love to mary stuart not to be
empress all that britain's seas enclose
find for me some place where i can hide
my unhappy head which brings destruction
on all who love it it is the last favour that
mary asks her faithful followers
in this dejected mood but still pursuing
her flight with unabated rapidity the unfortunate
mary after having been joined
by lord berries and a few followers at
length halted for the first time at the abbey
 dundrennan nearly sixty miles dig
tant from the field battle in this remote
corner galloway the reformation
not having yet been strictly enforced against
the monks a few still lingered in their cells
unmolested j and the prior with tears and
 the abbot
reverence received the fugitive queen at
the gate his convent
i bring you ruin my good father said
the queen as she was lifted from her palfrey

 it is welcome said the prior if it
comes in the train duty
placed on the ground and supported by
her ladies the queen looked for an instant
at her palfrey which jaded and drooping
its head seemed as if it mourned the distresses
 its mistress
 good roland said the queen whispering
let rosabelle be cared for ask thy
heart and it will tell thee why i make this
little request even in this awful hour
she was conducted to her apartment and
in the hurried consultation her attendants
the fatal resolution the retreat to
england was finally adopted in the morning
it received her approbation and a messenger
was dispatched to the english warden
to pray him fox safeconduct and los
the abbot 
vitality on the part the queen scotland
on the next day the abbot walked
in the garden the abbey with roland
to whom he expressed his disapprobation
 the course pursued it is madness and
ruin he said better commit herself to
the savage highlanders or wildbordermen
than to the faith elizabeth a woman to
a rival woman a presumptive successor to
the keeping a jealous queen roland
berries is true and loyal but his counsel
has ruined his mistress
ay ruin follows us every where said
an old man with a spade in his hand and
dressed like a laybrother whose presence
in the vehemence his exclamation
the abbot had not been aware gaze
not on me with such wonder i am he
who was the abbot boniface at kenna
quhair who was the gardener blinkhoolie at
lochleven hunted round to the place in
which i served my noviciate and now yeare
come to rouse me up againa weary
 the abbot
life i have had for one to whom peace was
ever the dearest blessing 
we will soon rid you our company
good father said the abbot and the
queen will i fear me trouble your retreat
no more
nay you said as much before said the
querulous old man rand yet i was put forth
from kinross and pillaged by troopers on
the road they took from me the certificate
that you wot that the baron 
ay he was a mosstrooper like themselves
you asked me it and i could never find
it but they found it it shewed the marriage
 my memory fails me now
see how men differ father nicholas would
have told you an hundred tales the abbot
ingram on whose soul god have mercy
 he was i warrant you fourscore and
six and i am not more than let me see
was not avenel the name you seek
my good father said roland impatiently
yet moderating his tone for fear alarming
or offending the infirm old man
the abbot 
ay right avenel julian avenel 
you are perfect in the name i kept all the
special confessions judging it held with my
vow to do so i could not find it when my
successor ambrosius spoke on't but the
troopers found it and the knight struck
his breast till the target clattered like an
empty wateringcan
saintmary said the abbot ein whom
could such a paper excite such interest 
what was the appearance the knight his
arms his colours 
ye distract me with your questions i
dared hardly look at him they charged me
with bearing letters for the queen and
searched my mail this was all along your
doings at lochleven
 i trust in god said the abbot to roland
who stood beside him shivering and
trembling with impatience the paper has
fallen into the hands my brother i heard
he had been with his followers on the scout
betwixt stirling and glasgow bore not
 the abbot
the knight a holly bough in his helmet 
canst thou not remember 
o remember remember said the
old man pettishly count as many years
as i do if your plots will let you and see
what and how much you remember 
why i scarce remember the pearmains
which i grained here with my own hands
some fifty years since
at this moment a bugle sounded loudly
from the beach
 it is the deathblast to queen mary's
royalty said ambrosius the english
warden's answer has been received favourable
doubtless for when was the door 
the trap closed against the prey which it was
set for droop not roland this matter
shall be sifted to the bottom but we must
not now leave the queen follow me et
us do our duty and trust the issue with god
farewell good father i will visit thee
again soon
he was about to leave the garden fou 
the abbot 
lowed by roland with halfreluctant steps
the ex abbot resumed his spade
i could be sorry for these men he
said ay and for that poor queen but
what avail earthly sorrows to a man fourscore
 and it is a rare dropping morning
for the early colewort
 he is stricken with age said ambrosial
as he dragged roland down to the seabeach
y we must let him take his time to
collectively nothing now can be thought
on but the fate the queen
they soon arrived where she stood surrounded
by her little train and by her side
the sheriff cumberland a gentleman 
the house other richly dressed and
accompanied by soldiers the aspect 
the queen exhibited a singular mixture 
alacrity and reluctance to depart her language
and gestures spoke hope and consolation
to her attendants and she seemed
desirous to persuade even herself that the
step she adopted was secure and that the
assurance she had received kind recept
the abbot
tion was altogether satisfactory but her
quivering lip and unsettled eye betrayed
at once her anguish at departing from scotland
and her fears confiding herself to
the doubtful faith england
welcome my lord abbot said she 
and you roland avenel we have joyful
news for you our loving sister's officer
proffers us in her name a safe asylum from
the rebels who have driven us from our
own only it grieves me we must here part
from you for a short space
 part from us madam said the abbot
j is your welcome in england then
to commence with the abridgment your
train and dismissal your counsellors 
take it not thus good father said
mary the warden and the sheriff faithful
servants our royal sister deem it
necessary to obey her instructions in the
present case even to the letter and can
only admit me with my female attendants
an express will instantly be dispatched
from london assigning me a place rethe
abbot 
silence and i will speedily send to all 
you whenever my court shall be formed
your court formed in england and
while elizabeth lives and reigns said the
abbot that will be when we shall see
two suns in one heaven 
do not think so replied the queen 
 we are well assured our sister's good
faith elizabeth loves fame and not all
that she has won by her power and her wisdom
will equal that which she will acquire
by extending her hospitality to a distressed
sister not all that she may hereafter do
 good wise and great would blot out
the reproach abusing our confidence
farewell my page now my knight farewell
for a brief season i will dry the tears
 catherine or i will weep with her till
neither us can weep longer she held
out her hand to roland who flinging himself
on his knees kissed it with much emotion
he was about to render the same
homage to catherine when the queen assc
the abbot
suing an air sprightliness said her
lips thou foolish boy and catherine coy
it not these english gentlemen should see
that even in our cold clime beauty knows
how to reward bravery and fidelity 
we are not now to learn the force 
scottish beauty or the mettle scottish
valour said the sheriff cumberland
courteously would it were in my power
to bid these attendants upon her who is
herself the mistress scottish beauty as
welcome to england as my poor cares would
make them but our queen's orders are
positive in case such an emergence and
they must not be disputed by her subject
may i remind your majesty that the tide
ebbs fast 
the sheriff took the queen's hand and
she had already placed her foot on the gangway
by which she was to enter the skiff
when the abbot starting from a trance 
grief and astonishment at the words the
sheriff rushed into the water and seized
upon her mantle
the abbot 
she foresaw it she foresaw it he
exclaimed she foresaw your flight into
her realm and foreseeing it gave orders
you should be thus received blinded deceived
doomed princess your fate is sealed
when you quit this strand queen 
scotland thou shalt not leave thine heritage
 he continued holding a still firmer
grasp upon her mantle true men shall
turn rebels to thy will that they may save
thee from captivity or death fear not the
bills and bows whom that gay man has at
his beck we will withstand him by force
o for the arm my warlike brother 
england avenel draw thy sword
the queen stood irresolute and frightened
 one foot upon the plank the other
on the sand her native shore which she
was quitting for ever
 what needs this violence sir priest
said the sheriff cumberland i came
hither at your queen's command to do her
service and i will depart at her least order
if she rejects such aid as i can offer no
 the abbot
marvel is it if our queen's wisdom foresaw
that such chance as this might happen
amidst the turmoils your unsettled state 
and while willing to afford fair hospitality
to her royal sister deemed it wise to prohibit
the entrance a broken army her
followers into the english frontier
you hear said queen mary gently
unloosing her robe from the abbot's grasp
 that we exercise full liberty choice in
leaving this shore and questionless the
choice will remain free to us in going to
france or returning to our own dominions
as we shall determine besides it is
too late your blessing father and godspeed
thee 
may he have mercy on thee and speed
thee also said the abbot retreating
but my soul tells me i look on thee for
the last time 
the sails were hoisted the oars were
plied the vessel went freshly on her way
through the faith which divides the shores
 cumberland from those galloway 
the abbot 
but not till the vessel diminished to the
size a child's frigate did the doubtful
and dejected and dismissed followers the
queen cease to linger on the sands and
long long could they discern the kerchief
 mary as she waved the oftrepeated signal
 adieu to her faithful adherents and
to the shores scotland
if good tidings a private nature could
have consoled roland for parting with his
mistress and for the distresses his sovereign
he received such comfort some days
subsequent to the queen's leaving dunduenna
a breathless post no other than
adam woodcock brought dispatches from
sir halbert glendinning to the abbot
whom he found with roland still residing
at dundrennan and in vain torturing boniface
with fresh interrogations the 
the abbot
et bore an earnest invitation to his brother
to make avenel castle for a time
his residence the clemency the
regent said the writer has extended
pardon both to roland and to you upon
condition your remaining a time under
my wardship and i have that to communicate
respecting the parentage roland
which not only you will willingly listen to
but which will be also found to afford meas
the husband his nearest relative
some interest in the future course his
life
the abbot read this letter and paused
as if considering what were best for him todo
meanwhile woodcock took roland
aside and addressed him as follows 
 now look mr roland that you do not
let any papist nonsense lure either the priest
or you from the right quarry see you
you ever bore yourself as a bit a gentleman
read that and thank god that
threw old abbot boniface in our way as
two the seyton's men were conveying
the abbot 
toward dundrennan here we searched
him for intelligence concerning that fair
exploit your's at lochleven that has
cost many a man his life and me a set 
sore bones and we found what is better
for your purpose than our's
the paper which he gave was indeed
an attestation by father philip subscribing
himself unworthy sacristan and brother 
the house saint mary's stating that
under a vow secrecy he had united in the
holy sacrament marriage julian avenel
and catherine graeme but that julian having
repented his union he father
philip had been sinfully prevailed on by
him to conceal and disguise the same according
to a complot devised betwixt him
and the said julian avenel whereby the
poor damsel was induced to believe that
the ceremony had been performed by one
not in holy orders and having no authority
to that effect which sinful concealment
the undersigned conceived to be the cause
vol iii q
 the abbot
why he was abandoned to the misguiding
 a water fiend whereby he had been under
a spell besides being sorely afflicted
with rheumatic pains ever after wherefore
he had deposited this certificate and
confession with the day and date the
said marriage with his lawful superior boniface
abbot saint mary's sui simili
confessions
it appeared by a letter from julian folded
carefully up with the certificate that the
abbot boniface had in effect bestirred
himself in the affair and obtained from the
baron a promise to avow his marriage but
the death both julian and his injured
bride together with the abbot's resignation
his ignorance the fate their unhappy
offspring and above all his listless and inactive
disposition had suffered the matter
to become totally forgotten until it was
recalled by some accidental conversation
with the abbot ambrosius concerning the
fortunes the avenel family at the rethe
abbot 
quest his successor he searched for it 
but as he would receive no assistance in
looking among the few records spiritual
experiences and important confessions
which he had conscientiously treasured
it might have remained for ever hidden
amongst them but for the more active researches
 sir halbert glendinning
so that you are like to be heir 
at last master roland after my lord
and lady have gone to their place said
adam and as i have but one boon to
ask i trust you will not nick me with
nay
not if it be in my power to say yes
my trusty friend
why then i must needs if i live to see
that day keep on feeding the classes with
unwashed flesh said woodcock sturdily
yet as if doubting the reception that his
request might meet with
 thou shalt feed them with what you
list for me said roland laughing i am
not many months older than when i left
s the abbot
the castle but i trust i have gathered wit
enough to cross no man skill in his own
vocation
 then i would not change places with
the king's falconer said adam woodcock
nor with the queen's neither but they
say she will be mewed up and never need
one i see it grieves you to think it and
i could grieve for company but what help
for it fortune will fly her own flight let a
man hollo himself hoarse
the abbot and roland journeyed to
avenel where the former was tenderly received
by his brother while the lady wept
for joy to find that in her favourite orphan
she had protected the sole surviving branch
 her own family sir halbert blending
and his household were not a little
surprised at the change which a brief acquaintance
with the world had produced in
their former inmate and rejoiced to find
in the petted spoiled and presuming page
a modest and unassuming young mean too
much acquainted with his own expectations
the abbot 
and character to be hot or petulant in demanding
the consideration which was readily
and voluntarily yielded to him the
old major domo innate was the first to
sing his praises to which mrs lilies bore a
loud echo always hoping that god would
teach him the true gospel
to the true gospel the heart roland
had secretly long inclined and the departure
 the good abbot for france with
the purpose entering into some house 
his order in that kingdom removed his
chief objection to renouncing the catholic
faith another might have existed in the
duty which he owed to magdalen graeme
both by birth and from gratitude but he
learned ere he had been long a resident in
avenel that his grandmother had died at
cologne in the performance a penance
too severe for her age which she had taken
upon herself in behalf the queen and
church scotland so soon as she heard
 the defeat at languid the zeal the
s the abbot
abbot ambrosius was more regulated but
he retired into the scottish convent 
and so lived there that the fraternity
were inclined to claim for him the
honours canonization but he guessed
their purpose and prayed them on his
deathbed to do no honours to the body 
one as sinful as themselves but to send his
body and his heart to be buried in avenel

house devotion might sleep among its
 ruins
long before that period arrived roland
avenel was wedded to catherine seyton
who after two years residence with her unhappy
mistress was dismissed upon her being
subjected to closer restraint than had
been at first exercised she returned to
her father's house and as roland was acknowledged
for the successor and lawful

increased as the estate was by the providence

the abbot 
occurred no objections to the match on the
part her family her mother was recently
dead when she first entered the convent
 and her father in the unsettled times
which followed queen mary's flight to
england was not averse to an alliance with
a youth who himself loyal to queen mary
still held some influence through means

roland and catherine therefore were
united spite their differing faiths and
the white lady whose apparition had been

butler's hudihras
there is a handsome parish church in the town
 woodstock i am told so at least for i never
saw it having scarce time when at the place to
view the magnificence blenheim its painted
halls and tapestried bowers and then return indue
season to dine in hall with my learned friend
the provost being one those occasions
on which a man wrongs himself extremely if he
lets his curiosity interfere with his punctuality i
had the church accurately described to me with
woodstock
a view to this work but as i have some reason
to doubt whether my informant had ever seen the
inside it himself i will be content to say that
it is now a handsome edifice most part which
was rebuilt forty or fifty years since although it
still contains some arches the old chantry
founded it is said by king john but it is to
this more ancient part the building that my
story refers
upon a morning in the september or
beginning october in the year being a
day appointed for a solemn thanksgiving for the
decisive victory at worcester a respectable audience
was assembled in the old chantry or chapel
 king john the condition the church
and character the audience both bore witness
to the rage civil war and the peculiar spirit 
the times the sacred edifice showed many marks
 dilapidation the windows once filled with
stained glass had been dashed to pieces with
pikes and muskets as matters and pertaining
to idolatry the carving on the readingdesk
was damaged and two fair screens beautiful
sculptured oak had been destroyed for the same
woodstock 
pithy and conclusive reason the high altar had
been removed and the gilded railing which was
once around it was broken down and carried off
the effigies several tombs were mutilated and
now lay scattered about the church
torn from their destined niche unworthy meed
 knightly counsel or heroic deed
the autumn wind piped through empty aisles in
which the remains stakes and premisses roughhewn
timber as well as a quantity scattered
hay and trampled straw seemed to intimate that
the hallowed precincts had been upon some late
emergency made the quarters a troop horse
the audience like the building was abated
in splendour none the ancient and habitual
worshippers during peaceful times were now to
 seen in their carved galleries with hands shadowing
their brows while composing their minds
to pray where their fathers had prayed and after
the same mode worship the eye the
yeoman and peasant sought in vain the tall form
 old sir henry lee ditchley as wrapped
in his laced cloak and with beard and whiskers
duly composed he moved slowly through the
woodstock
aisles followed by the faithful raastiflp or bloodhound
which in old time had saved his master by
his fidelity and which regularly followed him to
church bevis indeed fell under the proverb
which avers he is a good dog which goes to
church f for bating an occasional temptation to
warble along with the accord he behaved himself
as decorously as any the congregation and
returned as much edified perhaps as some 
them the damsels woodstock looked as
vainly for the laced cloaks jingling spurs slashed
boots and tall plumes the young cavaliers
 this and other highborn houses moving
through the streets and the churchyard with the
careless ease which indicates perhaps rather an
overweening degree selfconfidence yet shows
graceful when mingled with good humour and
courtesy the good old dames too in their
white hoods and black velvet gowns their daughters
 the cynosure neighbouring eyes 
where were they all now who when they entered
the church used to divide men's thoughts
between them and heaven but ah alice
lee so sweet so gentle so condescending in thy
woodstock

loveliness thus proceeds a contemporary annalist
whose manuscript we have deciphered
why is my story to turn upon thy fallen fortunes
 and why not rather to the period when
in the very dismounting from your palfrey you
attracted as many eyes as if an angel had descended
 as many blessings as if the benignant being
had come fraught with good tidings no
creature wert thou an idle romancers imagination
 no being fantastically bedizened with inconsistent
perfections thy merits made me love
thee well and for thy faults i think they made
me love thee better
with the house lee had disappeared from
the chantry king john others gentle blood
and honoured lineage freemantles winklecomes
drycotts c for the air that blew over
the towers oxford was unfavourable to the
growth puritanism which was more general
in the neighbouring counties there were among
the congregation however one or two that by
their habits and demeanour seemed country gentlemen
 consideration and there were also present
some the notables the town woodstock
cutlers or glovers chiefly whose skill in
 woodstock
steel or leather had raised them to a comfortable
livelihood these dignitaries wore long black
cloaks plaited close at the neck and like peaceful
citizens carried their bibles and membrane
at their girdles instead knife or
sword this respectable but least numerous
part the audience were such decent persons as
had adopted the presbyterian form faith renouncing
the liturgy and hierarchy the church
 england and using under the tuition the
rev nehemiah holdenough much famed for the
length and strength his powers predication
with these grave seniors sate their goodly dames
in ruff and gorget like the portraits which in
catalogues paintings are designed wife a
burghmaster and their pretty daughters whose
study like that chaucers physician was not
always in the bible but who were on the contrary
when a glance could escape the vigilance
 their honoured mothers inattentive themselves
and the cause inattention in others
but besides these dignified persons there
were in the church a numerous collection the
lower orders some brought thither by curiosity
but many them unwashed artificers bee

woodstock 
wintered in the theological discussions the
time and as many various sects as there are
colours in the rainbow the presumption 
these learned thebes being in exact proportion
to their ignorance the last was total and the first
boundless their behaviour in the church was
anything but reverential or edifying most 
them affected a cynical contempt for all that was
only held sacred by human sanction the church
was to these men but a steeplehouse the clergyy
man an ordinary person her ordinances dry
bran and sapless pottage unfitted for the spiritualized
palates the saints and the prayer an
address to heaven to which each acceded or not
as in his too critical judgment he conceived fit
the elder amongst them sate or lay on the
benches with their high steeplecrowned hats
pulled over their severe and knitted brows waiting
for the presbyterian parson as mastiffs sit
in dumb expectation the bull that is to be
brought to the stake the younger mixed some
 them a bolder licence manners with their
heresies they gazed round on the women yawned
coughed and whispered eat apples and cracked
woodstock
ed nuts as if in the gallery a theatre ere the
piece commences
besides all these the congregation contained
a few soldiers some in corslet and steel caps
some in buff and others in red coats these men
 war had their chandeliers with ammunition
slung round them and rested on their pikes and
muskets they too had their peculiar doctrines
on the most difficult points religion and united
the extravagances enthusiasm with the most
determined courage and resolution in the field
the burghers woodstock looked on these
military saints with no small degree awe for
though not often sullied with deeds plunder
or cruelty they had the power both absolutely
in their hands and the peaceful citizens had
no alternative save submission to whatever the
illregulated and enthusiastic imaginations their
martial guides might suggest
after some time spent in waiting for him mr
holdenough began to walk up the aisles the
chapel not with the slow and dignified carriage
with which the old rector was yore wont to
maintain the dignity the surplice but with a
woodstock 
hasty step like one who arrives too late at an appointment
and bustles forward to make the best
use his time he was a tall thin man with
an adust complexion and the vivacity his eye
indicated some irascibility temperament his
dress was brown not black and over his other
vestments he wore in honour calvin a geneva
cloak a blue colour which fell backward from
his shoulders as he posted on to the pulpit his
grizzled hair was cut as short as shears could perform
the feat and covered with a black silk skullcap
which stuck so close to his head that the two
ears expanded from under it as if they had been
intended as handles by which to lift the whole
person moreover the worthy divine wore spectacles
and a long grizzled peaked beard and he
carried in his hand a small pocketbible with silver
clasps upon arriving at the pulpit he
paused a moment to take breath then began to
ascend the steps by two at a time
but his course was arrested by a strong hand
which seized his cloak it was that one who
had detached himself from the group soldiery
he was a stout man middle stature with a
woodstock
quick eye and a countenance which though plain
had yet an expression that fixed the attention
his dress though not strictly military partook 
that character he wore large hose made 
calvesleather and a tuck as it was then called or
rapier tremendous length balanced on the
other side by a dagger the belt was morocco
garnished with pistols
the minister thus intercepted in his duty
faced round upon the party who had seized him
and demanded in no gentle tone the meaning 
the interruption
friend quoth the intruder is it thy purpose
to hold forth to these good people 
ay marry is it said the clergyman and
such is my bounden duty woe to me if i preach
not the gospel prithee friend let me not in my
labour
nay said the man warlike mien i am
myself minded to hold forth therefore do thou
desist or if thou wilt do by mine advice remain
and fructify with those poor goslings to whom i
am presently about to shake forth the crumbs 
comfortable doctrines
woodstock 
give place thou man satan said the
priest waxing wroth respect mine order my
cloth
i see no more to respect in the cut thy
cloak or in the cloth which it is fashioned
said the other than thou didst in the bishop's
rocket they were black and white thou art blue
and brown sleeping dogs every one you
lying down loving to slumber shepherds that
starve the flock but will not watch it each looking
to his own gain hum
scenes this indecent kind were so common
at the time that no one thought interfering
 the congregation looked on in silence the
better class scandalized and the lower orders
some laughing and others backing the soldier or
minister as their fancy dictated meantime the
struggle waxed fiercer mr holdenough clamoured
for assistance
mr mayor woodstock he exclaimed
wilt thou be among those wicked magistrates
who bear the sword in vain citizens will you
not help your pastor worthy aldermen will
you see me strangled on the pulpit stairs by this
 woodstock
man bufl'and belial but lo i will overcome
him and cast his cords from me
as holdenough spoke he struggled to ascend
the pulpit stairs holding hard on the bannisters
his tormentor held fast by the skirts the cloak
which went nigh to the choking the wearer
until as he spoke the words last mentioned
in a halfstrangled voice mr holdenough dexterously
slipped the string which tied it round
his neck so that the garment suddenly gave
way the soldier fell backwards down the steps
and the liberated divine skipped into his pulpit
and began to give forth a psalm triumph
over his prostrate adversary but a great hubbub
in the church marred his triumph and although
he and his faithful clerk continued to sing the
hymn victory their notes were only heard by
fits like the whistle a curled during a gale 
wind
the cause the tumult was as follows the
mayor was a zealous presbyterian and witnessed
the intrusion the soldier with great indignation
from the very beginning though he hesitated to
interfere with an armed man while on his legs and
woodstock 
capable resistance but no sooner did he behold
the champion independency sprawling on
his back with the diviners geneva cloak fluttering
in his hands than the magistrate rushed forward
exclaiming that such insolence was not to be
endured and ordered his constables to seize the
prostrate champion proclaiming in the magnanimity
 wrath i will commit every redcoat 
them all i will commit him were he noll cromwell
himself
the worthy mayor's indignation had overmastered
his reason when he made this mistimed
vaunt for three soldiers who had hitherto stood
motionless like statues made each a stride in
advance which placed them betwixt the municipal
officers and the soldier who was in the act 
arising then making at once the movement 
resting arms according to the manual as then practised
their musketbutts rang on the church pavement
within an inch the gouty toes master
mayor the energetic magistrate whose efforts
in favour order were thus checked cast one
glance on his supporters but that was enough to
show him that force was not on his side all
had shrunk back on hearing that ominous clatter
 woodstock
 stone and iron he was obliged to descend to
expostulation
what do you mean my masters said he 
is it like a decent and godfearing soldiery
who have wrought such things for the land as
have never before been heard to brawl and
riot in the church or to aid abet and comfort a
profane fellow who hath upon a solemn thanksgiving
excluded the minister from his own pulpits

we have nought to do with thy church as
thou call'st it said he who by a small feather
in front his morion appeared to be the corporal
 the party we see not why men gifts
should not be heard within these citadels superstition
as well as the voice the men crape
 old and the men cloak now wherefore
we will pluck yon jack presbyter out his
wooden sentinelbox and our own watchman shall
relieve the guard and mount thereon and cry
aloud and spare not
nay gentlemen said the mayor if such
be your purpose we have not the means to withstand
you being as you see peaceful and quiet
woodstock 
men but let me first speak with this worthy minister
nehemiah holdenough to persuade him
to yield up his place for the time without farther
scandal
the peacemaking mayor then interrupted
the quavering holdenough and the clerk and
prayed both to retire else there would he said
be certainly strife
 strife replied the presbyterian divine
with scorn no fear strife among men that
dare not testify against this open profanation 
the church and daring display heresy would
your neighbours banbury have brooked such
an insult 
come come mr holdenough said the
mayor put us not to mutiny and cry clubs
i tell you once more we are not men war or
blood
not more than may be drawn by the point
 a needle said the preacher scornfully ye
tailors woodstock for what is a glover buta
tailor working on kidskin i forsake you in
scorn your faint hearts and feeble hands and
will seek me elsewhere a flock which will not fly
vol i b
 woodstock
from their shepherd at the braying the first
wild ass which cometh from out the great deserts

so saying the aggrieved divine departed from
his pulpit and shaking the dust from his shoes
left the church as hastily as he had entered it
though for a different reason the citizens saw
his retreat with sorrow and not without a compunctious
feeling as if they were not playing the
most courageous part in the world the mayor
himself and several others left the church to follow
and appease him
the independent orator late prostrate was
now triumphant and inducting himself into the
pulpit without farther ceremony he pulled a
bible from his pocket and selected his text
from the fortyfifth psalm gird thy sword
upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory
and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperously
 upon this theme he commenced one
 those wild declamations common at the period
in which men were accustomed to wrest
and pervert the language scripture by adapting
it to modern events the language which
in its literal sense was applied to king david
woodstock 
and typically referred to the coming the
messiah was in the opinion the military
orator most properly to be interpreted oliver
cromwell the victorious general the infant
commonwealth which was never destined
to come age gird on thy sword exclaimed
the preacher emphatically and was not
that a pretty bit steel as ever dangled from a
corslet or rung against a steel saddle ay ye
prick up your ears now ye cutlers woodstock
as if ye should know something a good
fox broadsword did you forge it i trowel was
the steel quenched with water from rosamond's
well or the blade blessed by the old cuckolds
 godson you would have us think i
warrant me that you wrought it and welded
it grinned and polished it and all the while it
never came on a woodstock stithy you were
all too busy making whittles for the lazy crapemen
 oxford bouncing priests whose eyes
were so closed up with fat that they could not
see destruction till she had them by the throat
but t can tell you where the sword was forged
and tempered and welded and grinned and
 woodstock
polished when you were as i said before making
whittles for false priests and daggers for
dissolute g d d nme cavaliers to cut the people
 england's throat with it was forged at
long marston moor where blows went faster
than ever rung hammer on anvil and it was tempered
at naseby in the best blood the cavaliers
 and it was welded in ireland against the
walls drogheda and it was grinned on scottish
lives at dunbar and now late it was
polished in worcester till it shines as bright as
the sun in the middle heaven and there is no
light in england that shall come nigh unto it
here the military part the congregation raised
a hum approbation which being a sound
ike the hear hear the british house 
commons was calculated to heighten the enthusiasm
 the orator by intimating the sympathy
 the audience and then resumed the
preacher rising in energy as he found that his
audience partook in these feelings what sayeth
the text ride on prosperously do not stop 
do not call a halt do not quit the saddle pursue
the scattered fliers sound the trumpet not
woodstock j
a levant or a flourish but a point war sound
boot and saddle to horse and away a charge i
follow after the young man what part have
we in him slay take destroy divide the spoil 
blessed art thou oliver on account thine honour
 thy cause is clear thy call is undoubted
never has defeat come near thy leading staff nor
disaster attended thy banner ride on flower 
england's soldiers ride on chosen leader 
god's champions gird up the loins thy resolution
and be steadfast to the mark thy high
calling 
another deep and stern hum echoed by the
ancient elbowed arches the old chantry gave
him an opportunity an instant's repose when
the people woodstock heard him and not
without anxiety turn the stream his oratory
into another channel
but wherefore ye people woodstock
do i say these things to you who claim no portion
in our david no interest in england's son
 jesse you who were fighting as well as
your might could and it was not very formidable
for the late man under that old bloodthirsty pawoodstock

past sir jacob aston are you not now plotting
or ready to plot for restoring as ye call it the
young man the unclean son the slaughtered
tyrant the fugitive after whom the true hearts
 england are now following that they may
take and slay him why should your rider
turn his bridle our way say you in your hearts 
we will none him if we may help ourselves
we will rather turn us to wallow in the mire 
monarchy with the sow that was washed but new
lys come men woodstock i will ask and
do you answer me hunger ye still after the
fleshpots the monks godson and ye will
say nay but wherefore except that the pots
are cracked and broken and the fire is extinguished
wherewith thy oven used to boil and again
i ask drink ye still the well the fornications
 the fair rosamond eye will say nay but
wherefore 
here the orator ere he could answer the question
in his own way was surprised by the following
reply very pithily pronounced by one the
congregation because you and the like 
you have left us no brandy to mix with it
woodstock 
all eyes turned to the audacious speaker who
stood beside one the thick sturdy saxon pillars
which he himself somewhat resembled being
short stature but very strongly made a squat
broad littlejohn sort figure leaning on a
quarterstaff and wearing a jerkin which though
now sorely stained and discoloured had once been
 the lincoln green and showed remnants 
having been laced there was an air careless
goodhumoured audacity about the fellow and
though under military restraint there were some
 the citizens who could not help crying out
well said joceline johffe
jolly joceline call ye him proceeded the
preacher without showing either confusion or displeasure
at the interruption i will make him
joceline the jail if he interrupts me again
one your parkkeepers i warrant that can
never forget they have borne c r upon their
badges and buglehorns even as a dog bears his
owner's name on his collar a pretty emblem for
christian men but the brute beast hath the
better him the brute heareth his own coat
and the caitiff thrall wears his master's i have
 woodstock
seen such a wag make a rope's wag ere now
where was i oh rebuking you for your
backsliding men woodstock yes then
ye will say ye have renounced popery and ye have
renounced prelacy and then ye wipe your mouth
like pharisees as ye are and who but you for
purity religion but i tell you ye are but
like jehu the son nisi who broke down the
house baal yet departed not from the sons 
jeroboam even so ye eat not fish on friday with
the blinded papists nor mincedpies on the twen
tyfifth day december like the slothful relations
but ye will gorge on sack posset each
night in the year with your blind presbyterian
guide and ye will speak evil dignities and
revile the commonwealth and ye will glorify
yourselves in your park woodstock and say
was it not walled in first any other in england
and that by henry son william called 
the conqueror and ye have a princely lodge
therein and call the same a royal lodge and
ye have an oak which ye call the king's oak and
ye steal and eat the venison the park and ye
say this is the king's venison we will wash it
woodstock 
down with a cup to the king's health better we
eat it than those roundheaded commonwealth
knaves but listen unto me and take warning
for these things come we to controversy with
you and our name shall be a cannonshot
before which your lodge in the pleasantness
whereof ye take pastime shall be blown into
ruins and we will be as a wedge to split asunder
the king's oak into billets to heat a brown baker's
oven and we will spark your park and
slay your deer and eat them ourselves neither
shall you have any portion thereof whether
in neck or haunch ye shall not haft a tenpenny
knife with the horns thereof neither shall
ye cut a pair breeches out the hide for all
ye be cutlers and glovers and ye shall have
no comfort or support neither from the sequestrated
traitor henry lee who called himself ranger
 woodstock nor from any on his behalf
for they are coming hither who shall be called
mahershalalhashbaz because he maketh haste
to the spoil
here ended this wild effusion the latter part
 which fell heavy on the souls the poor citie
woodstock 
sens woodstock as tending to confirm a
report an unpleasing nature which had been
lately circulated the communication with london
was indeed slow and the news which it transmitted
were uncertain no less uncertain were the
times themselves and the rumours which were
circulated exaggerated by the hopes and fears
 so many various factions but the general
stream report so far as woodstock was concerned
had late run uniformly in one direction
day after day they had been informed that the
fatal fiat parliament had gone out for selling
the park woodstock destroying its lodge
dispersing its forest and crazing as far as they
could be crazed all traces its ancient fame
many the citizens were likely to be sufferers on
this occasion as several them enjoyed either
by sufferance or right various convenient privileges
 pasturage cutting fire wood and the like
in the royal chase and all the inhabitants the
little borough were hurt to think that the scenery
 the place was to be destroyed its edifices ruined
and its honours rent away this is a patriotic
sensation often found in such places which
woodstock 
ancient distinctions and longcherished recollect
tions former days render so different from
towns recent date the natives woodstock
felt it in the fullest force they had trembled at
the anticipated calamity but now when it was
announced by the appearance those dark stern
and at the same time omnipotent soldiers now
that they heard it proclaimed by the mouth 
one their military preachers they considered
their fate as inevitable the causes disagreement
among themselves were for the time forgotten
as the congregation dismissed without psalmody
or benediction went slowly and mournfully
homeward each to his own place abode
chapter 
come forth old man thy daughter's side
is now the fitting place for thee 
when time hath quelle the oak's bold pride
the youthful tendril yet may hide
the ruins the parent tree
when the sermon was ended the military
orator wiped his brow for notwithstanding the
coolness the weather he was heated with the
vehemence his speech and action he then descended
from the pulpit and spoke a word or two
to the corporal who commanded the party soldiers
who replying by a sober nod intelligence
drew his men together and marched them
in order to their quarters in the town
the preacher himself as if nothing extraordinary
had happened left the church and sauntered
through the streets woodstock with the
air a stranger who was viewing the town withwoodstock

out seeming to observe that he was himself in his
turn anxiously surveyed by the citizens whose
furtive yet frequent glances seemed to regard him
as something alike suspected and dreadful yet
on no account to be provoked he heeded them
not but stalked on in the manner affected by the
distinguished fanatics the day a stiff solemn
pace a severe and at the same time a contemplative
look like that a man incensed at the interruptions
which earthly objects forced upon
him obliging him by their intrusion to withdraw
his thoughts for an instant from celestial things
innocent pleasures what kind soever they held
in suspicion and contempt and innocent mirth
they abominated it was however a cast mind
that formed men for great and manly action as
it adopted principle and that an unselfish character
for the ruling motive instead the gratification
 passion some these men were indeed
hypocrites using the cloak religion only as a
covering for their ambition but many really possessed
the devotional character and the severe
republican virtue which others only affected by
far the greater number hovered between these
 woodstock
extremes felt to a certain extent the power 
religion and complied with the times in affecting
a great deal
the individual whose pretensions to sanctity
written as they were upon his brow and gait have
given rise to the above digression reached at
length the extremity the principal street
which terminates upon the park woodstock
a battlemented portal gothic appearance defended
the entrance to the avenue it was 
mixed architecture but on the whole though
composed the styles different ages when
it had received additions had a striking and
imposing effect an immense gate composed 
rails hammered iron with many a flourish and
scroll displaying as its uppermost ornament the
illfated cypher c r was now decayed partly
with rust partly from the effects violence
the stranger paused as if uncertain whether
he should demand or assay entrance he looked
through the grating down an avenue skirted by
majestic oaks which led onward with a gentle
curve as if into the depths some ample and ancient
forest the wicket the large iron gate being
woodstock 
left unwittingly open the soldier was tempted to
enter yet with some hesitation as he that intrudes
upon ground which he conjectures may be prohibited
 indeed his manner showed more reverence
for the scene than could have been expected
from his condition and character he slackened
his stately and consequential pace and at
length stood still and looked around him
not far from the gate he saw rising from the
trees one or two ancient and venerable turrets
bearing each its own vane rare device glittering
in the autumn sun these indicated the
ancient hunting seat or lodge as it was called
which had since the time henry been occasionally
the residence the english monarchs
when it pleased them to visit the woods oxford
which then so abounded with game that according
to old fuller huntsmen and falconers
were nowhere better pleased the situation which
the lodge occupied was a piece flat ground now
planted with sycamores not far from the entrance
to that magnificent spot where the spectator first
stops to gaze upon blenheim to think marls
woodstock
borough's victories and to applaud or criticise
the cumbrous magnificence hamburgh's style
there too paused our military preacher but
with other thoughts and for other purpose than
to admire the scene around him it was not long
afterwards when he beheld two persons a male
and a female approaching slowly and so deeply
engaged in their own conversation that they did
not raise their eyes to observe that there stood a
stranger in the path before them the soldier
took advantage their state abstraction and
desirous at once to watch their motions and avoid
their observation he glided beneath one the
huge trees which skirted the path and whose
boughs sweeping the ground on every side insured
him against discovery unless in case an
actual search
in the meantime the gentleman and lady continued
to advance directing their course to a rustic
seat which still enjoyed the sunbeams and
was placed adjacent to the tree where the stranger
was concealed
the man was elderly yet seemed bent more
woods took 
by sorrow and infirmity than by the weight 
years he wore a mourning cloak over a dress
 the same melancholy colour cut in that picturesque
form which vandyke has rendered immortal
but although the dress was handsome
it was put on and worn with a carelessness which
showed the mind the wearer ill at ease his
aged yet still handsome countenance had the
same air consequence which distinguished his
dress and his gait a striking part his appearance
was a long white beard which descended
far over the breast his slashed doublet and
looked singular from its contrast jn colour with
his habit
the young lady by whom this venerable gentleman
seemed to be in some degree supported
as they walked arm in arm was a slight and
sylphlike form with a person so delicately made
and so beautiful in countenance that it seemed
the earth on which she walked was too grossly massive
a support for a creature so aerial but mortal
beauty must share human sorrows the eyes 
the beautiful being showed tokens tears her
colour was heightened as she listened to her aged
vol i c 
 woodstock
companion and it was plain from his melancholy
yet displeased look that the conversation was as
distressing to himself as to her when they sate
down on the bench we have mentioned the gentleman's
discourse could be distinctly overheard
by the evesdropping soldier but the answers 
the young lady reached his ear rather less distinctly

it is not to be endured said the old man
passionately it would stir up a paralytic
wretch to start up a soldier my people have
been thinned i grant you or have fallen off
from me in these times i owe them no grudge
for it poor knaves what should they do when
the pantry has no bread and the buttery no ale 
but we have still about us some rugged foresters
 the old woodstock breed old as myself most
 them what that old wood seldom warps
in the wetting i will hold out the old house
and it will not be the first time that i have held
it against ten times the strength that we hear
 now immml
alas my dear father said the young
lady in a tone which seemed to intimate his proposal
 defence to be altogether desperate
woodstock 
and why alas said the gentleman angrily 
is it because i shut my door on a score or two
 these bloodthirsty hypocrites 
but their masters can as easily send a regiment
or an army if they wills replied the lady 
and what good would your present defence do
excepting to exasperate them to your utter destruction

be it so alice replied her father i have
lived my time and beyond it i have outlived
the kindest and most princelike masters
what do i do on the earth since the dismal
thirtieth january the parricide that day
was a signal to all true servants charles stuart
to avenge his death or die as soon after as they
could find a worthy opportunity
do not speak thus sir said alice lee 
it does not become your gravity and your
worth to throw away that life which may yet be
 service to your king and country it will not
and cannot always be thus england will not
long endure the rulers which these bad times
have assigned her in the meanwhile here
a few words escaped the listener's ears and
 woodstock
beware that impatience which makes bad
worse
worse exclaimed the impatient old man
what can be worse is it not at the worst already
 will not these people expel us from the
only shelter we have left dilapidate what remains
 royal property under my charge make the
palace princes into a den thieves and then
wipe their mouths and thank god as if they had
done an alms deed 
still said his daughter there is hope behind
and i trust the king is ere this out their
reach we have reason to think well my brow
ther albert's safety
ay albert there again said the old man
in a tone reproach had it not been for thy
entreaties i had gone to worcester myself but
i must needs lie here like a worthless hound
when the hunt is up when who knows what service
i might have shown an old man's head is
sometimes useful when his arm is but little worth
but you and albert were so desirous that he
should go alone and now who can say what has
become him 
woodstock 
 nay nay father said alice we have
good hope that albert escaped from that fatal
day young abney saw him a mile from the field
young abney lied i believe said the father
in the same humour contradiction 
 young abney's tongue seems quicker than his
hands but far slower than his horse's heels when
he leaves the roundheads behind him i would
rather albert's dead body were laid between
charles and cromwell than hear he fled as early
as young abney
my dearest father said the young lady
weeping as she spoke what can i say to comfort
you 
comfort me say'st thou girl i am sick 
comfort an honourable death with the ruins 
woodstock for my monument were the only
comfort to old henry lee yes by the memory
 my father i will make good the lodge against
these rebellious robbers
 yet be ruled dearest father said the maiden
 and submit to that which we cannot gainsay
my uncle everard 
here the old man caught at her unfinished
 woodstock
words thy uncle everard wench well get
on what thy precious and loving uncle
everard 
nothing sir she said if the subject displeases
you
 displeases me he replied why should it
displease me or if it did why should'st thou
or any one affect to care about it what is it
that hath happened late years what is it can
be thought to happen that astrologer can guess at
which can give pleasure to us 
fate she replied may have in store the
joyful restoration our banished prince
too late for my time alice said the knight
 if there be such a white page in the heavenly
 it will not be turned until long after my
day but i see thou wouldn't escape me in a
word what thy uncle everard 
nay sir said alice god knows i would
rather be silent for ever than speak what might
as you would take it add to your present distemperature

distemperature said her father oh thou
art a sweetlipped physician and would'st i warwoodstock
s
rant me drop nought but sweet balm and ho 
ney and oil on my distemperature if that is
the phrase for an old man's ailment when he is
well nigh heartbroken once more what thy
uncle everard 
his last words were uttered in a high and
peevish tone voice and alice lee answered
her father in a trembling and submissive tone
i only meant to say sir that i am well assured
that my uncle everard when we quit this
place 
that is to say when we are kicked out it
by cropeared canting villains like himself but
on with thy bountiful uncle what will he do 
will he give us the remains his worshipful
and economical housekeeping the fragments 
a thricesacked capon twice aweek and a plentiful
fast on the other aye days will he give us
beds beside his half starved nags and put them
under a short allowance straw that his sister's
husband that i should have called my deceased
angel by such a name and his sister's daughter
may not sleep on the stones or will he send usa
noble each with a warning to make it last for
 woodstock
he had never known the readypenny so hard to
come by or what else will your uncle everard
do for us get us a furlough to beg why i
can do that without him
 you misconstrue him much answered alice
with more spirit than she had hitherto displayed 
and would you but question your own heart
you would acknowledge i speak with reverence
that your tongue utters what your better judgment
would disown my uncle everard is neither
a miser nor a hypocrite neither so fond the
goods this world that he would not supply our
distresses amply nor so wedded to fanatical opinions
as to exclude charity for other sects beside
his own
 ay ay the church england is a sect
with him i doubt not and perhaps with thee too
alice said the knight what is a muggles
man or a ranter or a brownish but a sectary 
and thy phrase places them all with jack presbyter
himself on the same footing with our learned
prelates and religious clergy such is the cant
 the day thou livest in and why shouldst thou
not talk like one the wise virgins and psalmwoodstock

singing sisters since though thou hast a profane
old cavalier for a father thou art own niece to
uncle everard 
if you speak thus my dear fathers said
alice what can i answer you hear me but
one patient word and i shall have discharged my
uncle everard's commissions
oh it is a commission then surely i suspected
so much from the beginning nay have
some sharp guess touching the ambassador also
come madam do your errand and you shall
have no reason to complain my patience
then sir replied his daughter my uncle
everard desires you would be courteous to the
commissioners who come here to sequestrate the
parks and the property or at least heedfully to
abstain from giving them obstacle or opposition 
it can he says do no good even on your own
principles and it will give a pretext for proceeding
against you as one in the worst degree 
malignity which he thinks may otherwise be
prevented nay he has good hope that if you
follow his counsel the committee may through
the interest he possesses be inclined to remove the
 woodstock
sequestration your estate on a moderate fine
thus says my uncle and having communicated
his advice i have no occasion to urge your patience
with farther argument
it is well thou dost not alice answered sir
henry lee in a tone suppressed anger forby
the blessed rood thou hast well nigh led me
into the heresy thinking thee no daughter
 mine ah my beloved companion who art
now far from the sorrows and cares this weary
world could'st thou have thought that the daughter
thou didst clasp to thy bosom would like the
wicked wife job become a temptress to her father
in the hour affliction and recommend to
him to make his conscience truckle to his interest
and to beg back at the bloody hands his master's
and perhaps his son's murderers a wretched
remnant his property he has been robbed 
why wench if i must beg think'st thou i will
sue to those who have made me a mendicant na
i will never show my grey beard worn in sorrow
for my sovereign's death to move the compassion
 some proud sequestrator who perhaps was one
 the parricides no if henry lde must sue
woodstock 
for food it shall be some sound loyalist like
himself who having but half a loaf remaining will
not nevertheless refuse to share it with him for
his daughter she may wander her own way
which leads her to a refuge with her wealthy
roundhead kinsfolk but let her no more call
him father whose honest indigence she has refused
to share 
you do me injustice sir answered the
young lady with a voice animated yet faltering
 cruel injustice god knows your way is my
way though it lead to ruin and beggary and
while you tread it my arm shall support you while
you will accept an aid so feeble
 thou worst me girl answered the old
cavalier thou worst me as will shakspeare
says thou speaks lending me thy arm but
thy secret thought is thyself to hang upon markham
everard's
my father my father answered alice in a
tone deep grief what can thus have altered
your clear judgment and kindly heart accursed
be these civil commotions not only do they
destroy men's bodies but they pervert their souls
 woodstock
and the brave the noble the generous become
suspicious harsh and mean why upbraid me
with markham everard have i seen or spoke
with him since you discharged him my company
with terms less kind i will speak it truly than
was due even to the relationship betwixt you 
why think i would sacrifice to that young man
my duty to you know that were i capable 
such criminal weakness markham everard were
the first to despise me for it
she put her handkerchief to her eyes but she
could not hide her sobs nor conceal the distress
they intimated the old man was moved
i cannot tell he said what to think it
thou seem'st sincere and wert ever a good and
kindly daughter how thou hast let that rebel
youth creep into thy heart i wot not perhaps it
is a punishment on me who thought the loyalty 
my house was like undefiled ermine yet here
is a damned spot and on the fairest gem all 
my own dear alice but do not weep we have
enough to vex us where is it that shakspeare
hath it 
woodstock 
gentle daughter
give even way unto ray rough affairs 
put you not on the temper the times
nor be like them to percy troublesome 
i am glad to hear you quote your favourite
again sir our little jars are ever well nigh
ended when shakspeare comes in play
his was the closetcompanion my
blessed master said sir henry lee after the
bible with reverence for naming them together
he felt more comfort in it than any other and
as i have shared his disease why it is natural i
should take his medicine albeit i pretend not
to my master's art in explaining the dark passages
 for i am but a rude man and rustically
brought up to arms and hunting
you have seen shakspeare sir said the
yoimg lady
silly wench replied the knight he died
when i was a mere child thou hast heard me
say so twenty times but thou would'st lead the
old man away from the tender subject well
though i am not blind i can shut my eyes and
follow ben jonson i knew and could tell thee
many a tale our meetings at the mermaid
 woodstock
where if there was much wine there was much
wit also we did not sit blowing tobacco in
each other's faces and turning up the whites 
our eyes as we turned up the bottom the winepot
old ben adopted me as one his sons in
the muses i have shown you have i not the
verses to my much beloved son the worshipful
sir henry lee ditchley knight and baronet
 
i do not remember them at present sir replied
alice
i fear ye lie wench said her father but
no matter thou can'st not get any more fooling
out me just now the evil spirit hath left
saul for the present we are now to think what
is to be done about leaving woodstock or defending
it
my dearest father said alice can you
still nourish a moment's hope making good the
place r
i know not wench replied sir henry i
would fain have a parting blow at them tis certain
 and who knows where a blessing may alight 
but then my poor knaves that must take part
woodstock 
with me in so hopeless a quarrel that thought
hampers me i confesses
oh let it do so sir replied alice there
are soldiers in the town and there are three regiments
at oxford
ah poor oxford exclaimed sir henry
whose vacillating state mind was turned by
a word to any new subject that suggested itself
 seat learning and loyalty these rude
soldiers are unfit inmates for thy learned halls
and poetical bowers but thy pure and brilliant
lamp shall defy the foul breath a thousand
churls were they to blow at it like boreas the
burning bush shall not be consumed even by the
heat this persecution
true sir said alice and it may not be
useless to recollect that any stirring the royalists
at this unpropitious moment will make them
deal yet more harshly with the university which
they consider as being at the bottom everything
which moves for the king in these parts
 it is true wench replied the knight and
small cause would make the villains sequestrate
the poor remains which the civil wars have left to
 
 woodstock
the colleges that and the risk my poor fellows
 well thou hast disarmed me girl i
will be as patient and calm as a martyr
pray god you keep your word sir replied
his daughter but you are ever so much moved
at the sight any these men that 
 would you make a child me alice 
said sir henry why know you not that i
can look upon a viper or a toad or a bunch 
engendering adders without any worse feeling
than a little disgust and though a roundhead
and especially a redcoat are in my opinion more
poisonous than vipers more loathsome than toads
more hateful than knotted adders yet can i overcome
my nature so far that should one them
appear at this moment thyself should see how
civilly i would entreat him
as he spoke the military preacher abandoned
his leafy screen and stalking forward stood unexpectedly
before the old cavalier who stared at
him as if he had thought that his expressions had
actually raised a devil
who art thou at length said sir henry
in a raised and angry voice while his daughter
woodstock 
clung to this arm in terror little confident that
her father's pacific resolutions would abide the
shock this unwelcome apparition
i am ones replied the soldier who neither
fear nor shame to call myself a poor daylabourer
in the great work england humph ay a
simple and sincere upholder the good old
cause
 and what the devil do you seek here said
the old knight fiercely
the welcome due to the steward the lords
commissioners answered the soldier
welcome art thou as salt would be to sore
eyes said the cavalier but who be your commissioners
man 
the soldier with little courtesy held out a
scroll which sir henry took from him betwixt
his finger and thumb as if it were a letter from a
pesthouse and held it at as much distance from
his eyes as his purpose reading it would permit
he then read aloud and as he named the
parties one by one he added a short commentary
on each name addressed indeed to alice but in
vol i d
 woodstock
such a tone that showed he cared not for its being
heard by the soldier
desboroitgh the ploughman dosborough 
as grovelling a clown as is in england a fellow
that would be best at home like an ancient scythian
under the tilt a waggon d n him
harrison a bloodyminded ranting enthusiast
who read the bible to such purpose that he never
lacked a text to justify a murder d n him too
bletson a trueblue commonwealth's man one
 harrison's rota club with his noddle full 
newfangled notions about government the clearest
object which is to establish the tail upon
the head a fellow who leaves you the statutes
and laws old england to prate rome and
greece sees the areopagus in westminsterhall
and takes old noll for a roman consul 
add he is like to prove a dictator amongst
them instead never mind d n bletson too
friend said the soldier i would willingly
be civil but it consists not with my duty to
hear these godly men in whose service i am
spoken after this irreverent and unbecoming
fashion and albeit i know that you malignant
woodstock 
think you have a right to make free with that
damnation which you seem to use as your own
portion yet it is superfluous to invoke it against
others who have better hopes in their thoughts
and better words in their mouths
thou art but a canting varlet replied the
knight and yet thou art right in some sense 
for it is superfluous to curse men who already are
damned as black as the smoke hell itself
i prithee forbear continued the soldier
for manners sake if not for conscience grisly
oaths suit ill with gray beards
nay that is truth if the devil spoke it said
the knight and i thank heaven i can follow
good counsel though old nick gives it and so
friend touching these same commissioners bear
them this message that sir henry lee is keeper
 woodstock park with right waif and stray
vert and venison as complete as any them have
to their estate that is if they possess any estate
but what they have gained by plundering honest
men nevertheless he will give place to those
who have made their might their right and will
 woodstock
not expose the lives good and true men where
the odds are so much against them and he
protests that he makes this surrender neither as
acknowledging these so termed commissioners
nor as for his own individual part fearing their
force but purely to avoid the loss english
blood which so much hath been spilt in these
late times
it is well spoken said the steward the
commissioners and therefore i pray you let
us walk together into the house that thou may'st
deliver up unto me the vessels and gold and silver
ornaments belonging unto the egyptian pharaoh
who committed them to thy keeping
 what vessels exclaimed the fiery old
knight and belonging to whom unbaptized
dog speak civil the martyr in my presence
or i will do a deed misbecoming me on that
caitiff corpse thine and shaking his daughter
from his right arm the old man laid his hand
on his rapier
his antagonist on the contrary kept his temper
completely and waving his hand to add impression
woodstock s
to his speech he said with a calmness which aggravated
sir henry's wrath nay good friend
i prithee be still and brawl not sit becomes not
gray hairs and feeble arms to rail and rant like
drunkards put me not to use the carnal weapon
in mine own defence but listen to the voice 
reason see'st thou not that the lord hath decided
this great controversy in favour us and
ours against thee and thine wherefore render
up thy stewardship peacefully and deliver up tome
the chattels the man charles stuart
patience is a good nag but she will bolt
said the knight unable longer to rein in his wrath
he plucked his sheathed rapier from his side
struck the soldier a severe blow with it and instantly
drawing it and throwing the scabbard
over the trees placed himself in a posture defence
with his sword's point within half a yard 
the steward's body the latter stepped back with
activity threw his long cloak from his shoulders
and drawing his long tuck stood upon his guard
the swords clashed smartly together while alice
in her terror screamed wildly for assistance but
the combat was short duration the old 
woodstock
cavalier had attacked a man as cunning fence ashe
himself or a little more so and possessing all
the strength and activity which time had deprived
sir henry and the calmness which the
other had lost in his passion they had scarce
exchanged three passes ere the sword the
knight flew up in the air as if it had gone in
search the scabbard and burning with shame
and anger sir henry stood disarmed at the
mercy his antagonist the republican showed
no purpose abusing his victory nor did he
either during the combat or after the victory was
won in any respect alter the sour and grave composure
which reigned upon his countenance a
combat life and death seemed to him a thing
as familiar and as little to be feared as an ordinary
bout with foils
thou art delivered unto my hands he said
and by the law arms i might smite thee under
the fifth rib even as asahel was struck dead
by abner the son nun as he followed the
chase on the hill ammah that lieth before
giah in the way the wilderness gibeon 
but far be it from me to spill thy remaining drops
woodstock 
 blood true it is thou art the captive my
sword and my spear nevertheless seeing that
there may be a turning from thine evil ways and
a returning to those which are good if the lord
enlarge thy date for repentance and amendment
wherefore should it be shortened by a poor sinful
mortal who is speaking truly but thy fellowworm
p
sir henry lee remained still confused and unable
to answer when there arrived a fourth person
whom the cries alice had summoned to
the spot this was joceline joliffe one the
underkeepers the walk who seeing how matters
stood brandished his quarterstaff a weapon
from which he never parted and having made it
describe the figure eight in a flourish through
the air would have brought it down with a vengeance
upon the head the steward had not sir
henry interposed
we must trail bats now joceline our time
 shouldering them is passed it skills not striving
against the hill the devil rules the roast
and makes our slaves our tutors
at this moment another auxiliary rushed out
woodstock
 the thicket to the knights assistance it eras
the large wolfdog in strength a mastiff in form
and almost in fleetness a greyhound which we
have already mentioned bevis was the noblest 
the kind which ever pulled down a stag tawnycoloured
like a lion with a black muzzle and blackfeet
just edged with a line white round the
toes he was as tractable as he was strong and
bold just as he was about to rush upon the soldier
the words peace bevis v from sir henry
converted the lion into a lamb and instead 
pulling the soldier down he walked round and
round and snuffed as if using all his sagacity to
discover who the stranger could be towards
whom though so questionable an appearance
he was enjoined forbearance apparently he was
satisfied for he laid aside his doubtful and threatening
demonstrations lowered his ears smoothed
down his bristles and wagged his tail
sir henry who had great respect for the sagacity
 his favourite said in a low voice to alice
bevis is thy opinion and counsels submission
there is the finger heaven in this to
punish the pride ever the fault our house 
woodstock 
friend he continued addressing the soldier
thou hast given the finishing touch to a lesson
which ten years constant misfortune have been
unable fully to teach me thou hast distinctly
shown me the folly thinking that a good cause
can strengthen a weak arm god forgive me for
the thought but i could almost turn infidel and
believe that heaven's blessing goes ever with
the longest sword but it will not be always thus
god knows his time reach me my toledo jofeline
yonder it lies and the scabbard see where
it hangs on the tree do not pull at my cloak
alice and look so miserably frightened i shall
be in no hurry to betake me to bright steel again
i promise thee for thee good fellow i thank
thee and will make way for thy masters without
 farther dispute or ceremony joceline johffe is
nearer thy degree than i am and will make surrender
to thee the lodge and household stuff
withhold nothing joliffe let them have all
for me i will never crossthe threshold again 
but where to rest for a night i would trouble
no one in woodstock hum ay it shall be so
alice and i joceline will go down to thy hut by
s woodstock
rosamond's well we will borrow the shelter 
thy roof for one night at least thou wilt give us
welcome wilt thou not how now a clouded
brow 
joceline certainly looked embarrassed directed
first a glance to alice then looked to heaven
then to earth and last to the four quarters the
horizon and then murmured out certainly 
without question might he but run down to put
the house in order
order enough order enough for those that
may soon be glad clean straw in a barn said
the knight but if thou hast an ill will to harbour
any obnoxious or malignant persons as the
phrase goes never shame to speak it out man
tis true i took thee up when thou wert but a
ragged robin made a keeper thee and so forth
what that sailors think no longer the
wind than when it forwards them on the voyage
thy betters turn with the tide why should not
such a poor knave as thou 
god pardon your honour for your harsh
judgment said joliife the hut is yours such
as it is and should be were it a king's palace as
woodstock 
i wish it were even for your honour's sake and
mistress alice only i could wish your honour
would condescend to let me step down before incase
any neighbour be there or or just to put
matters something into order for mistress alice
and your honour just to make things something
seemly and shapely
not a whit necessary said the knight
while alice had much trouble in concealing her
agitation if thy matters are unseemly they are
fitter for a defeated knight if they are unshapely
why the liker to the rest a world which is
all shaped go thou with that man what is
thy name friend 
joseph tomkins is my name in the flesh
said the steward men call me honest joe
and trusty tomkins
if thou hast deserved such names considering
what trade thou hast driven thou art a jewel
indeed said the knight yet if thou hast not
never blush for the matter joseph for if thou
art not in truth honest thou hast all the better
chance to keep the fame it the title and the
go woodstock
thing itself have long walked separate ways farewell
to thee and farewell to fair woodstock 
so saying the old knight turned round and
pulling his daughter's arm through his own they
walked onward into the forest in the same posture
in which they were introduced to the reader
woodstock
chapter iii
now ye wild blades that make loose inns your stage
to vapour forth the aces this sad age
stout edgehill fight the wherries and the west
and northern clashes where you still fought best 
your strange escapes your dangers void fear
when bullets flew between the head and ear
whether you fought by damme or the spirit
 you i speak
legend captain jones
joseph tomkins and joliffe the keeper remained
for some time in silence as they stood
together looking along the path in which the
figures the knight ditchley and pretty
mistress ace had disappeared behind the trees
they then gazed on each other in doubt as
men who scarce knew whether they stood on hostile
or on friendly terms together and were at
a loss how to open a conversation they heard
the knight's whistle summon bevis but though
the good hound turned his head and pricked his
cars at the sound yet he did not obey the call
 woodstock
but continued to snuff around joseph tomkinss
cloak
thou art a rare one i fear me said the
keeper looking to his new acquaintance i
have heard men who have charms to steal
both dogs and deer
trouble thyself not about my qualities
friend said joseph tomkins but bethink
thee doing thy master's bidding
joceline did not immediately answer but at
length as if in sign truce stuck the his
quarterstaff upright in the ground and leant
upon it as he said gruffly so ray tough old
knight and you were at drawn bilbo by way 
afternoon service sir preacher well for you i
came not up till the blades were done jingling
or i had rung evensong upon your pate
the independent smiled grimly as he replied
nay friend it is well for thyself for never
should sexton have been better paid for the
knell he tolled nevertheless why should there
be war betwixt us or my hand be against thine 
thou art but a poor knave doing thy master's
order nor have i any desire that my own blood
or thine should be shed touching this matter
woodstock 
thou art i understand to give me peaceful possession
 the palace woodstock so called 
though there is now no palace in england no nor
shall be in the days that come after until we shall
enter the palace the new jerusalem and the
reign the saints shall commence on earths
pretty well begun already friend tompkins
said the keeper you are little short being
kings already upon the matter as it now stands 
and for your jerusalem i wot not but woodstock
is a pretty nestegg to begin with well will
you show will you on will you take sasine and
livery you heard my orders
humph i know not said tomkins i
must beware ambuscades and i am alone
here moreover it is the high thanksgiving
appointed by parliament and owned to by the
army also the old man and the young woman
may want to recover some their clothes and
personal property and i would not that they
were baulked on my account wherefore if
thou wilt deliver me possession tomorrow morning
it shall be done in personal presence my
own followers and the presbyterian man the
mayor so that the transfer may be made before
 woodstock
witnesses whereas were there none with us but
thou to deliver and i to take possession the men
 belial might say go to trusty tomkins hath
been an edomite honest joe hath been as an
ishmaelite rising up early and dividing the spoil
with them that served the man yea they that
wore beards and green jerkins as in remembrance
 the man and his governments
joceline fixed his keen dark eyes upon the
soldier as he spoke as if in design to discover
whether there was fair play in his mind or not
he then applied his five fingers to scratch a large
shock head hair as if that operation was
necessary to enable hit to come to a conclusion
this is all fair sounding brother said he but
i tell you plainly there are some silver mugs and
platters and flagons and so forth in yonder house
which have survived the general sweep that sent
all our plate to the smeltingpot to put our knight's
troop on horseback now if thou takes not these
off my hand i may come to trouble since it maybe
thought i have finished their numbers 
whereas i being as honest a fellow 
as ever stole venison said tomkins nay
i do owe thee an interruption
woodstock
go to then replied the keeper if a stag
may have come to mischance in my walk it was
no way in the course dishonesty but merely
to keep my old dame's pan from rusting but
for silver porringers tankards and such like i
would as soon have drunk the melted silver as
stolen the vessel made out it so that i would
not wish blame or suspicion fell on me in this
matter and therefore if you will have the
things rendered even now why so and if not
hold me blameless
ay truly said tomkins and who is to
hold me blameless if they should see cause to
think anything finished not the right worshipful
commissioners to whom the property the
estate is as their own therefore as thou say'st
we must walk warily in the matter to lock up
the house and leave it were but the work 
simple ones what mayest thou to spend the
night there and then nothing can be touched
without the knowledge us both 
why concerning that answered the keeper
 i should be at my hut to make matter
vol i e
 woodstock
somewhat conformable for him and mistress
alice for my old dame joan is something
dunny and will scarce know how to manage 
and yet to speak truth by the mass i would
rather not see sir henry tonight since what has
lapped today hath roused his spleen and it is
a pera venture he may have met something at
the hut which will scarce tend to cool it
it is a pity said tomkins that being a
gentleman such grave and goodly presence
he should be such a malignant cavalier and that
he should like the rest that generation 
vipers have clothed himself with curses as with
a garment
 which is as much as to say the tough old
knight hath a habit swearing said the keeper
grinning at a pun which has been repeated
since his time but who can help it it comes
 use and wont were you now in your bodily
self to light suddenly on a maypole with all
the blithe morrisdancers prancing around it to
the merry pipe and tabor with bells jingling
ribbons fluttering lads frisking and laughing
woodstock g
lasses leaping till you might see where the scarlet
garter fastened the lightblue hose i think some
feeling resembling either natural sociality or
old use and wont would get the better friend
even thy gravity and thou wouldst fling thy
cuckolds steeplehat one way and that bloodthirsty
longsword another and trip like the
noodles hogsnorton when the pigs play on
the organ
the independent turned fiercely round on the
keeper and replied how now mr green jerkin
 what language is this to one whose hand
is at the plough i advise thee to put curb on
thy tongue lest thy ribs pay the forfeit
nay do not take the high tone with me
brother answered joceline remember thou
hast not the old knight sixtyfive to deal with
but a fellow as bitter and prompt as thyself
it may be a little more so younger at all events
and prithee why shouldst thou take such umbrage
at a maypole i would thou hadst known
one phil hazeldine these parts he was the
best morrisdancer betwixt oxford and bedford
 woodstock
the more shame to him answered the independent
 and i trust he has seen the error
 his ways and made himself as if a man 
action he easily might fit for better company
than woodhunters deerstealers maid marion
swashbucklers deposed revellers bloody brawlers
maskers and mummers lewd men and light
women fools and fiddlers and carnal selfpleases
 every description
well replied the keeper you are out 
breath in time for here we stand before the famous
maypole woodstock
they paused in an open space meadowland
beautifully skirted by large oaks and sycamores
one which as king the forest stood a little
detached from the rest as if scorning the vicinity
 any rival it was scathed and gnarled
in the branches but the immense trunk still
showed to what gigantic size the monarch the
forest can attain in the groves merry england
that is called the king's oak said joce
line the oldest men woodstock know not
how old it is they say henry used to sit under
woodstock 
it with fair rosamond and see the lasses dance
and the lads the village run races and wrestle
for belts or bonnets
i nothing doubt it friend said tomkins 
a tyrant and a harlot were fitting patron and
patroness for such vanities
thou may'st say thy say friend replied
the keeper so thou hottest me say mine there
stands the maypole as thou seest half a flightshot
from the king's oak in the midst the
meadow the king gave ten shillings from the
customs woodstock to make a new one yearly
besides a tree fitted for the purpose out the
forest now it is warped and withered and twisted
like a wasted briarrod the green too used
to be closeshaved and rolled till it was smooth
as a velvet mantle now it is rough and overgrown

well well friend joceline said the independent
 but where was the edification all
this what use doctrine could be derived
from a pipe and tabor or was there ever aught
like wisdom in a bagpipe 
 woodstock
 you may ask better scholars that said
joceline but methinks men cannot be always
grave and with the hat over their brow a young
maiden will laugh as a tender flower will blow 
ay and a lad will ike her the better for it just
as the same blithe spring that makes the young
birds whistle bids the blithe fawns skip there
have come worse days since the jolly old times
have gone by i tell thee that in the holidays
which you mr longford have put down i
have seen this greensward alive with merry maidens
and manly fellows the good old rector himself
thought it was no sin to come for a while
and look on and his goodly cassock and scarf
kept us all in good order and taught us to limit
our mirth within the bounds discretion we
might it may be crack a broad jest or pledge
a friendly cup a turn too often but it was in
mirth and good neighbourhood ay and if there
was a bout at singlestick or a bellyful boxing
it was all for love and kindness and better
a few dry blows in drink than the bloody doings
we have had in sober earnest since the presby
woodstock 
ter's cap got above the bishop's mitre and we
exchanged our goodly rectors and learned doctors
whose sermons were all bolstered up with
as much greek and latin as might have confounded
the devil himself for weavers and cobblers
and such other pulpit volunteers as as
we heard this morning it will out
well friend said the independent with
patience scarce to have been expected i quarrel
not with thee for nauseating my doctrine if
thine ear is so much tickled with tabor tunes and
morris tripping truly it is not likely thou should'st
find pleasant savour in more wholesome and sober
food but let us to the lodge that we may go
about our business there before the sun sets
 troth and that may be advisable for more
reasons than one said the keeper for there
have been tales about the lodge which have made
men afeard to harbour there after nightfall
were not yon old knight and yonder damsel
his daughter wont to dwell there said the
independent my information said so
ay truly did they said eocene and
 woodstock
when they kept a jolly household all went well
enough for nothing banishes fear uke good ale
but after the best our men went to the wars
and were slain at naseby flight they who were
left found the lodge more lonesome and the old
knight has been much deserted his servants 
marry it might be that he has lacked silver
 late to pay groom and lackey
 a potential reason for the diminution a
household said the soldier
right sir even so replied the keeper
they spoke steps in the great gallery heard
by dead the night and voices that whispered
at noon in the matted chambers and the servants
pretended that these things scared them
away but in my poor judgment when martinmas
and whitsuntide came round without a 
the old bluebottles servingmen began
to think creeping elsewhere before the frost
chilled them no devil so frightful as that which
dances in the pocket where there is no cross to
keep him out
you were reduced then to a petty household
 said the independent
woodstock 
ay marry were we said joceline but
we kept some halfscore together what with bluebottles
in the lodge what with green caterpillars
 the chase like him who is yours to command
 we stuck together till we found a call to
take a morning's ride somewhere or other
 to the town worcester said the soldier
where you were crushed like vermin and palmer
worms as you are
you may say your pleasure replied the
keeper i'll never contradict a man who has
got my head under his belt our backs are at
the wall or you would not be here
nay friend said the independent thou
rises nothing by thy freedom and trust in me
i can be hon camarado to a good soldier although
i have striven with him even to the going down 
the sun but here we are in front the lodge
they stood accordingly in front the old
gothic building irregularly constructed and at
different times as the humour the english
monarchs led them to taste the pleasures woodstock
chase and to make such improvements for
ff woodstock
their own accommodation as the increasing luxury
 each age required the oldest part the
structure had been named by tradition fair rosamond's
tower it was a small turret great
height with narrow windows and walls massive
thickness the tower had no opening to
the ground or means descending a great part
 the lower portion being solid masonwork it
was traditionally said to have been accessible only
by a sort small drawbridge which might be
dropped at pleasure from a little portal near the
summit the turret to the battlements another
tower the same construction but twenty feet
lower and containing only a winding staircase
called in woodstock love's ladder because it
is said that by ascending this staircase to the
top the tower and then making use the
drawbridge henry obtained access to the chamber
 his paramour
this tradition had been keenly impugned by
dr rochecliffe the former rector woodstock
who insisted that what was called rosamond's
tower was merely an interior keep or citadel to
woodstock 
which the lord or warden the castle might retreat
when other points safety failed him and
either protract his defence or at the worst stipulate
for reasonable terms surrender the people
 woodstock jealous their ancient traditions
did not relish this new mode explaining
them away and it is even said that the mayor
whom we have already introduced became presbyterian
in revenge the doubts cast by the
rector upon this important subject rather choosing
to give up the liturgy than his fixed belief
in rosamond's tower and love's ladder
the rest the lodge was considerable extent
and different ages comprehending a nest
 little courts surrounded by buildings which
corresponded with each other sometimes withindoors
sometimes by crossing the courts and frequently
in both ways the different heights 
the building announced that they could only be
connected by the usual variety staircases which
exercised the limbs our ancestors in the sixteenth
and earlier centuries and seem sometimes
to have been contrived for no other purpose
 woodstock
the varied and multiplied fronts this irregular
building were as dr rochecliffe was wont to
say an absolute banquet to the architectural antiquary
as they certainly contained specimens 
every style which existed from the pure norman
 henry anjou down to the composite half
gothic half classical architecture elizabeth
and her successor accordingly the rector was
himself as much enamoured woodstock as
ever was henry fair rosamond and as his
intimacy with sir henry lee permitted him entrance
at all times to the royal lodge he used
to spend whole days in wandering about the antique
apartments examining measuring studying
and finding out excellent reasons for architectural
peculiarities which probably only owed
their existence to the freakish fancy a gothic
artist but the old antiquarian had been expelled
from his living by the intolerance and troubles
 the times and his successor nehemiah holdenough
would have considered an elaborate investigation
 the profane sculpture and architecture
 blinded and bloodthirsty papists togewoodstock

ther with the history the dissolute amours 
old norman monarchs as httle better than a
bowing down before the calves bethel and a
drinking the cup abominations we return
to the course our story
there is said the independent tomkins
after he had carefully perused the front the
building many a rare monument olden
wickedness about this miscalled royal lodge 
verily i shall rejoice much to see the same destroyed
yea burned to ashes and the ashes
thrown into the brook kedron or any other
brook that the land may be cleansed from the
memory thereof neither remember the iniquity
with which their fathers have sinned
the keeper heard him with secret indignation
and began to consider with himself whether as
they stood but one to one and without chance 
speedy interference he was not called upon by
his official duty to castigate the rebel who used
language so defamatory but he fortunately recollected
that the strife must be a doubtful one
that the advantage arms was against him 
to woodstock
and that in especial even if he should succeed
in the combat it would be at the risk severe
retaliation it must be owned too that there
was something about the independent so dark
and mysterious so grim and grave that the more
open spirit the keeper felt oppressed and if
not overawed at least kept in doubt concerning
him and he thought it wisest as well as safest
for his master and himself to avoid all subjects
 dispute and know better with whom he was
dealing before he made either friend or enemy
 him
the great gate the lodge was strongly bolted
but the wicket opened on joceline's raising
the latch there was a short passage ten feet
which had been formerly closed by a portcullis
at the inner while three loopholes opened on
either side through which any daring intruder
might be annoyed who having surprised the
first gate must be thus exposed to a severe fire
before he could force the second but the machinery
 the portcullis was damaged and it
now remained a fixture brandishing its jaw well
woodstock 
furnished with iron fangs but incapable dropping
it across the path invasion
the way therefore lay open to the great
hall or outer vestibule the lodge one 
 this long and dusky apartment was entirely
occupied by a gallery which had in ancient times
served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels
there was a clumsy staircase at either side
 it composed entire logs a foot square 
and in each angle the ascent was placed byway
 sentinel the figure a norman footsoldier
having an open casque on his head which
displayed features as stern as the painter's genius
could devise their arms were buffjackets or
shirts mail round bucklers with spikes in the
centre and buskins which adorned and defended
the feet and ancles but left the knees bare these
wooden warders held great swords or maces in
their hands like military guards on duty many
an empty hook and brace along the walls the
gloomy apartment marked the spots from which
arms long preserved as trophies had been in the
pressure the war once more taken down to do
u
 woodstock
service in the field like veterans whom extremity
 danger recalls to battle on other rusty
fastenings were still displayed the hunting trophies
 the monarchs to whom the lodge belonged
and the sylvan knights to whose care
it had been from time to time confided
at the nether the hall a huge heavy
stonewrought chimneypiece projected itself ten
feet from the wall adorned with many a cypher
and many a scutcheon the royal house 
england in its present state it yawned like the
arched mouth a funeral vault or perhaps
might be compared to the crater an extinguished
volcano but the sable complexion 
the massive stonework and all around it showed
that the time had been when it sent its huge fires
blazing up the huge chimney besides puffing
many a volume smoke over the heads the
jovial guests whose royalty or nobility did not
render them sensitive enough to quarrel with
such slight inconvenience on these occasions it
was the tradition the house that two cartloads
 wood was the regular allowance for the fire
woodstock 
between noon and curfew and the andirons or
dogs as they were termed constructed for retaining
the blazing fire wood on the hearth were
wrought in the shape lions such gigantic size
might well warrant the legend there were long
seats stone within the chimney where in despite
 the tremendous heat monarchs were sometimes
said to have taken their station and amused themselves
with broiling the tumbles or dowsets the
deer upon the glowing embers with their own
royal hands tradition was here also ready with
her record to show what merry gibes such as
might be exchanged between prince and peer
had flown about at the merry banquet which
followed the michaelmas hunt she could tell
too exactly where king stephen sat when he
darned his own princely hose and the odd
tricks he had put upon little winking the tailor
 woodstock
most this rude revelry belonged to the plantagenet
times when the house tudor acceded
to the throne they were more chary their royal
presence and feasted in halls and chambers far
vol i f
 woodstock
within abandoning the outmost hall to the yeomen
 the guard who mounted their watch there
and passed away the night with wassail and mirth
exchanged sometimes for frightful tales apparitions
and sorceries which made some those
grow pale in whose ears the trumpet a french
foeman would have sounded as jollily as a summons
to the woodland chase
joceline pointed out the peculiarities the
place to his gloomy companion more briefly than
we have detailed them to the reader the independent
seemed to listen with some interest at
first but flinging it suddenly aside he said ina
solemn tone perish babylon as thy master
nebuchadnezzar hath perished he is a wanderer
and thou shalt be a waste place yea and a
wilderness yea a desert salt in which there
shall be thirst and famines
 there is like to be enough both tbnights
said joceline unless the good knights larder
be somewhat fuller than it is wont
 we must care for the creaturecomforts
said the independent but in due season when
woodstock 
our duties are done whither lead these entrances


that to the right replied the keeper leads
to what are called the stateapartments not used
since the year sixteen hundred and thirtynine
when his blessed majesty 
how sir interrupted the independent ina
voice thunder doest thou speak charles
stuart as blessing or blessed beware the proclamation
to that effect
i meant no harm answered the keeper
suppressing his disposition to make a harsher reply
 my business is with bolts and bucks not
with titles and state affairs but yet whatever
may have lapped since that poor king was followed
with blessings enough from woodstock
for he left a glove full broad pieces for the
poor the place 
peace friend said the independent i
will think thee else one those besotted and
blinded papists who hold that bestowing alms
is an atonement and washing away the wrongs
and oppressions which have been wrought by
 woodstock 
the almsgiver thou mayest then these were the
apartments charles stuart 
and his father james before him and
elizabeth before him and bluff king henry
who builded that wing before them all
and there i suppose the knight and his
daughter dwelt 
no replied joceline sir henry lee
had too much reverence for for things which
are now thought worth no reverence at all besides
the staterooms are unaired and in indifferent
order since hate years the knight ranger's
apartment lies by that passage to the left
and whither goes yonder stair which seems
both to lead upwards and downwards 
upwards replied the keeper it leads to
many apartments used for various purposes 
sleeping and other accommodation downwards
to the kitchen offices and vaults the castle
which at this time the evening you cannot
see without lights
we will to the apartments your knight
thence said the independent is there fitting
accommodation there 
woodstock s
such as has served a person condition
whose lodging is now worse appointed answered
the honest keeper his bile rising so fast that he
added in a muttering and inaudible tone so it
may well serve a cropeared knave like thee
he acted as the usher however and led on
towards the ranger's apartments
this suite opened by a short passage from the
hall secured at time need by two oaken doors
which could be fastened by large bars the same
that were drawn out the wall and entered
into square holes contrived for their reception
on the other side the portal at the 
this passage a small anteroom received them
into which opened the sittingapartment the
good knight which in the style the times
might have been termed a fair summer parlour 
lighted by two oriel windows so placed as to command
each them a separate avenue leading
distant and deep down into the forest the principal
ornament the apartment besides two or
three family portraits less interest was a tall
fulllength picture which hung above the chime
which like that in the hall was 
 woodstock
heavy stonework ornamented with carved scutcheons
emblazoned with various devices the
portrait was that a man about fifty years 
age in complete plate armour and painted in
the harsh and dry manner holbein probably
indeed the work that artist as the dates corresponded
the formal and marked angles
points and projections the armour were a
good subject for the harsh pencil that early
school the face the knight was from the
fading the colours pale and dim like that 
some being from the other world yet the lines
expressed forcibly pride and exultation he
pointed with his leadingstaff or truncheon to the
background where in such perspective as the
artist possessed were depicted the remains a
burning church or monastery and four or five
soldiers in red cassocks bearing away in triumph
what seemed a brazen font or laver above their
heads might be traced in scroll lee victor sic
voluit right opposite to the picture hung ina
niche in the wall a complete set tilting armour
the black and gold colours and ornaments
woodstock 
 which exactly corresponded with those exhibited
in the portrait
the picture was one those which from
something marked in the features and expression
attract the observation even those who
are ignorant art the independent looked
at it until a smile passed transiently over his
clouded brow whether he smiled to see the
grim old cavalier employed in desecrating a religious
house an occupation much conforming
to the practice his own sect whether he smiled
in contempt the old painter's harsh and
dry mode working or whether the sight 
this remarkable portrait revived some other ideas
the underkeeper could not decide
the smile passed away in an instant as the
soldier looked to the oriel windows the recesses
within them were raised a step or two from the
wall in one was placed a walnuttree readingdesk
and a huge stuffed armchair covered with
spanish leather a little cabinet stood beside
with some its shuttles and drawers open displaying
hawksbells dogwhistles instruments for
trimming a falcon's feathers bridlebits various
 woodstock
constructions and other trifles connected with
sylvan sport
the other little recess was differently furnished
there lay some articles needlework on a
small table besides a lute with a having
some airs pricked down in it and a frame for
working embroidery some tapestry was displayed
around the recess with more attention to ornament
than was visible in the rest the apartment 
the arrangement a few bowpots with such
flowers as the fading season afforded showed
also the superintendence female taste
tomkins cast an eye careless regard upon
these subjects female occupation then stepped
into the farther window and began to turn the
leaves a folio which lay open on the readingdesk
apparently with some interest joceline
who had determined to watch his motions without
interfering with them was standing at some
distance in dejected silence when a door behind
the tapestry suddenly opened and a pretty village
maid tripped out with a napkin in her hand
as if she had been about some household duty
how now sir impudence she said to
woodstock 
joceline in a smart tone what do you here
prowling about the apartments when the master
is not at home 
but instead the answer which perhaps she
expected joceline joliffe cast a mournful glance
towards the soldier in the oriel window as if to
make what he said fully intelligible and replied
with a dejected appearance and voice alack
my pretty phoebe there come those here that
have more right or might than any us and
will use little ceremony in coming when they will
and staying while they please
he darted another glance at tom king who
still seemed busy with the before him then
sidled close to the astonished girl who had continued
looking alternately at the keeper and at
the stranger as if she had been unable to understand
the words the first or to comprehend
the meaning the second being present
 go whispered joliffe approaching his
mouth so near her cheek that his breath waved
the curls her hair go my dearest phoebe
trip it as fast as a fawn down to my lodge i
will soon be there and
 woodstock
your lodge indeed said phoebe you are
very bold for a poor killbuck that never frightened
anything before save a dun deer your
lodge indeed i am like to go there i think
hush hush phoebe there is no time for
jesting down to my hut i say like a deer for
the knight and mrs alice are both there and i
fear will not return hither again all's naught
girl and our evil days are come at last with a
vengeance we are fairly at bay and fairly hunted
down
can this be joceline said the poor girl
turning to the keeper with an expression 
fright in her countenance which she had hitherto
averted in rural coquetry
as sure my dearest phoebe as 
the rest the asseveration was lost in phcebes
ear so closely did the keeper's lips approach it 
and if they approached so very near as to touch
her cheek grief like impatience hath its privileges
and poor phoebe had enough serious
alarm to prevent her from demurring upon such
a trifle
but no trifle was the approach joceline's
woodstock 
lips to phoebe's pretty though sunburnt cheek
in the estimation the independent who a utthe
before the object joceliiie's vigilance had
been in his turn the observer the keeper's
demeanour so soon as the interview betwixt
phoebe and him had become so interesting and
when he remarked the closeness joceline's argument
he raised his voice to a pitch harshness
that would have rivalled that a saw and
which at once made joceline and phoebe spring
six feet apart each in contrary directions and
if cupid was the party must have sent him
out at the window like a wildduck flying from
a culverin instantly throwing himself into the
attitude a preacher and a reprover vice
how now he exclaimed shameless and
impudent as you are what chambering and
wantoning in our very presence how would
you play your pranks before the steward the
commissioners the high court parliament
as ye would in a booth at the fulsome fair or
amidst the trappings and tracings a profane
dancingschool where the scoundrel minstrels
make their ungodly weapons to squeak kiss
 woodstock
and be kind the fiddler's blind fbut here
he said dealing a perilous thump upon the
volume here is the king and high priest 
those vices and follies here is he whom men
 folly profanely call nature's miracle here is
he whom princes chose for their cabinetkeeper
and whom maids honour take for their bedfellow
 here is the prime teacher fine words
foppery and folly here dealing another
thump upon the volume and oh revered the
roxburgh it was the first folio beloved the
bannatyne it was hemmings and rondel it
was the edition princeps on thee he continued
 on thee william shakspeare i charge
whatever such lawless idleness and immodest
folly hath defiled the land since thy day 
by the mass a heavy accusation said joce
line the bold recklessness whose temper could
not be long overawed odds pitlikins is our
master's old favourite will stratford to answer
for every buss that has been snatched since
james's time a perilous reckoning truly but
i wonder who is possible for what lads and lasses
did before his day 
woodstock 
scoff not said the soldier lest i being
called thereto by the voice within me do deal
with thee as a scorner verily i say that since
the devil fell from heaven he never wanted
agents on earth yet nowhere hath he met with
a wizard having such infinite power over men's
souls as this pestilent fellow shakspeare seeks
a wife a foul example for adultery here she shall
find it would a man know how to train his
fellow to be a murderer here shall he find tutoring
 would a lady marry a heathen negro
she shall have chronicled example for it would
any one scorn at his maker he shall be furnished
with a jest in this would he defy his brother
in the flesh he shall be accommodated with
a challenge would you be drunk shakspeare
will cheer you with a cup would you plunge in
sensual pleasures he will soothe you to indulgence
as with the lascivious sounds a lute
this i say this is the wellhead and source

a torrent making men scoffers doubters deniers
murderers makebates and lovers the winepot
haunting unclean places and sitting long at
 woodstock
the eveningwine away with him away with
him men england to tophet with his wicked
 and to the vale hinnom with his accursed
bones verily but that our march was
hasty when we passed stratford in the year s
with sir william waller but that our march
was hasty 
 because prince rupert was after you with
his cavaliers muttered the incorrigible joce
line
i say continued the zealous trooper raising
his voice and extending his arm but that our
march was by command hasty and that we turned
not aside in our riding closing our ranks each
one upon the other as becomes men war i
bad torn on that day the bones that preceptor
 vice and debauchery from the grave and given
them to the next dunghill i would have made
his memory a scoff and a hissing 
that is the bitterest thing he has said yet
observed the keeper poor will would have
liked the hissing worse than all the rest
will the gentleman say any more inquired
phoebe in a whisper lackaday he talks
woodstock 
brave words if one knew but what they meant
but it is a mercy our good knight did not see him
ruffle the at that rate mercy on us there
would certainly have been bloodshed but oh
the father see how he is twisting his face about 
is he ill the colic think'st thou joceline 
or may i offer him a glass strong waters 
 hark thee hither wench f said the keeper
he is but loading his blunderbuss for another
volley and while he turns up his eyes and
twists about his face and clenches his fist and
shuffles and tramples with his feet in that fashion
he is bound to take no notice anything i
would be sworn to cut his purse if he had one
from his side without his feeling it
la joceline said phoebe and if he abides
here in this turn times i dare say the gentleman
will be easily served
care not thou about that said joliffe 
 but tell me softly and hastily what is in the
pantry 
small housekeeping enough said phoebe
 a cold capon and some comfits and the great
standing venison pasty with plenty spice a
manchet or two besides and that is all
 woodstock
well it will serve for a pinchwrap thy
cloak round thy comely body get a basket and
a brace trenchers and towels they are heinously
impoverished down yonder carry down the
capon and the marches the pasty must abide
with this same soldier and me and the piecrust
will serve us for bread
rarely said phoebe i made the paste
myself it is as thick as the walls fair rosamond's
tower
which two pair jaws would be long in
gnawing through work hard as they might said
the keeper stck
was at present fastened conceiving that this was
some precaution johffes old housekeeper 
whose deafness they were all aware sir henry
raised his voice to demand admittance but in
vain irritated at this delay he pressed the door
at once with foot and hand in a way which the
frail barrier was unable to resist it gave way accordingly
and the knight thus forcibly entered
the kitchen or outward apartment his servant
in the midst the floor and with a posture
which indicated embarrassment stood a youthful
stranger in a ridingsuit
 this may be my last act authority here
said the knight seizing the stranger by the collar
 but i am still ranger woodstock for
this night at least who or what art thou 
the stranger dropped the ridingmantle in
which his face was muffled and at the same time
fell on one knee
your poor kinsman markham everard he
said who came hither for your sake although
he fears you will scarce make him welcome for
this own
sir henry started back but recovered himself
in an instant as one who recollected that he had
woodstock 
a part dignity to perform he stood erect
therefore and replied with considerable assumption
 stately ceremony 
fair kinsman it pleases me that you are
come to woodstock upon the very first night
that for many years which have past is likely to
promise you a worthy or a welcome receptions
now god grant it be so that i rightly hear
and duly understand you said the young man 
while alice though she was silent kept her looks
fixed on her father's face as if desirous to know
whether his meaning was kind towards his nephew
which her knowledge his character inclined
her greatly to doubt
the knight meanwhile darted a sardonic look
first on his nephew then on his daughter and
proceeded i need not i presume inform mr
markham everard that it cannot be our purpose
to entertain him or even to offer him a seat in
this poor hut
i will attend you most willingly to the lodge
said the young gentleman i had indeed j urged
you were already there for the evening and feared
to intrude upon you but if you would permit
me my dearest uncle to escort my king woos
woodstock
man and you back to the lodge believe me
amongst all which you have so often done 
good and kind you never conferred benefit that
will be so dearly prized
you mistake me greatly mr markham everard
replied the knight it is not our purpose
to return to the lodge tonight nor by our
lady tomorrow neither i meant but to intimate
to you in all courtesy that at woodstock
lodge you will find those for whom you are fitting
society and who doubtless will afford you
a willing welcome which i sir in this my present
retreat do not presume to offer to a person
 your consequence
for heaven's sake said the young man
turning to alice tell me how i am to understand
language so mysterious
alice to prevent his increasing the restrained
anger her father compelled herself to answer
though it was with difficulty we are expelled
from the lodge by soldiers
expelled by soldiers exclaimed everard
in surprise there is no legal warrant for this
none at all answered the knight in the
same tone cutting irony which he had all along
woodstock 
used and yet as lawful a warrant as for aught
that has been wrought in england this twelvemonth
and more you are i think or were an
innsofcourtman marry sir your enjoyment
 your profession is like that lease which a prodigal
wishes to have a wealthy widow you
have already survived the law which you studied
and its expiry doubtless has not been without
a legacy some decent pickings some merciful
increases as the phrase goes you have deserved
it two ways you wore buff and bandalier
as well as wielded pen and ink i have not
heard if you held forth too
think me and speak me as harshly as
you will sir said everard submissively i
have but in this evil time guided myself by my
conscience and my father's commands
o an you talk conscience said the old
knight i must have mine eye upon you as
hamlet says never yet did puritan cheat so
grossly as when he was appealing to his conscience
 and as for thy father 
he was about to proceed in a tone the same
invective when the young man interrupted him
 woodstock
by saying in a firm tone sir henry lee you
have ever been thought noble say me what
you will but speak not my father what the
ear a son should not endure and which yet his
arm cannot resent to do me such wrong is to
insult an unarmed man or to beat a captive
sir henry paused as if struck by the remark
 thou hast spoken truth in that mark
wert thou the blackest puritan whom hell ever
vomited to distract an unhappy country
 be that as you will to think it replied everard
 but let me not leave you to the shelter
 this wretched hovel the night is drawing to
storm let me but conduct you to the lodge
and expel these intruders who can as yet at least
have no warrant for what they do i will not
linger a moment behind them save just to deliver
my father's message grant me but this much
for the love you once bore me 
yes mark answered his uncle firmly but
sorrowfully thou speaks truth i did love
thee once the brighthaired boy whom i taught
to ride to shoot to hunt whose hours happiness
were spent with me wherever those gras
ill
ver labours were employed i did love that boy
ay and i am weak enough to love even the
memory what he was but he is gone mark
he is gone and in his room i only behold an
avowed and determined rebel to his religion and
to his king a rebel more detestable on account
 his success the more infamous through the
plundered wealth with which he hopes to gild
his villainy but i am poor thou think'st and
should hold my peace lest men say speak sirrah
when you should know however that
indigent and plundered as i am i feel myself
dishonoured in holding even but this much talk
with the tool usurping rebels go to the
lodge if thou wilt yonder lies the way but
think not that to regain my dwelling there or all
the wealth i ever possessed in my wealthiest days
i would willingly accompany thee three steps on
the greensward if i must be thy companion it
shall be only when thy redcoats have tied my
hands behind me and bound my legs beneath my
horse's belly thou may'st be my fellowtraveller
then i grant thee if thou wilt but not sooner
alice who suffered cruelly during this 
woodstock
hogue and was well aware that farther argument
would only kindle the knight's resentment still
more highly ventured at last in her anxiety to
make a sign to her cousin to break off the interview
and to retire since her father commanded his
absence in a manner so peremptory unhappily
she was observed by sir henry who concluding
that what he saw was evidence a private understanding
betwixt the cousins his wrath acquired
new fuel and it required the utmost exertion
 selfcommand and recollection all that was
due to his own dignity to enable him to veil his
real fury under the same ironical manner which
he had adopted at the beginning this angry ininterview

 if thou art afraid he said to trace our
forestglades by night respected stranger to
whom i am perhaps bound to do honour as my
successor in the charge these walks here seems
to be a modest damsel who will be most willing
to wait on thee and be thy bowbearer only
for her mother's sake let there pass some slight
form marriage between you ye need no licence
or priest in these happy days but may be
buckled like beggars in a ditch with a hedge for
woodstock 
a churchroof and a tinker for a priest i crave
pardon you for making such an officious and
simple request perhaps you are a ranter or
one the family love or hold marriage rites
as unnecessary as knipperdoling or jack 
ley den
for mercy s sake forbear such dreadful jesting
my father and do you markham begone
in god's name and leave us to our fate your
presence makes my father rave
jesting said sir henry i was nevermore
serious raving i was never more composed
 i could never brook that falsehood
should approach me i would no more bear by
my side a dishonoured daughter than a dishonoured
sword and this unhappy day hath shown
that both can fail 
sir henry said young everard load not
your soul with a heavy crime which be assured
you do in treating your daughter thus unjustly
it is long now since you denied her to me when
we were poor and you were powerful i acquiesced
in your prohibition all suit and intercourse
god knoweth what i suffered but i
vol i h
 woodstock
acquiesced neither is it to renew my suit that
i now come hither and have i do acknowledge
sought speech her not for her own sake only
but for yours also destruction hovers over you
ready to close her pinions to stoop and her talons
to clutch yes sir look contemptuous as
you will such is the case and it is to protect both
you and her that i am here
 you refuse then my free gift said sir
henry lee or perhaps you think it loaded
with too hard conditions 
shame shame on you sir henry t said
everard waxing warm in his turn have your
political prejudices so utterly warped every feeling
 a father that you can speak with bitter
mockery and scorn what concerns your own
daughter's honour hold up your head fair
alice and tell your father he has forgotten nature
in his fantastic spirit loyalty know
sir henry that though i would prefer your
daughter's hand to every blessing which heaven
could bestow on me i would not accept it my
conscience would not permit me to do so when
i knew it must withdraw her from her duty to
you
woodstock 
your conscience is over scrupulous young
man carry it to some dissenting rabbi and he
who takes all that comes to net will teach thee
it is sinning against our mercies to refuse any
good thing that is freely offered to us
 when it is freely offered and kindly offered
not when the offer is made in irony and insult
fare thee well alice if aught could make me
desire to profit by thy father's wild wish to cast thee
from him in a moment unworthy suspicion it
would be that while indulging in such sentiments
sir henry lee is tyrannically oppressing the creature
who all others is most dependent on his
kindness who ail others will most feel his
severity and whom all others he is most
bound to cherish and support 
do not fear for me mr everard exclaimed
alice aroused from her timidity by a dread 
the consequences not unlikely to ensue where
civil war set relations as well as fellowcitizens
in opposition to each other oh begone i
conjure you begone nothing stands betwixt me
and my father's kindness but these unhappy family
divisions but your illtimed presence here
for heaven's sake leave us 
 woodstock
soh mistress answered the hot old cavalier
 you play lady paramount already and
who but youyou would dictate to our train i
warrant like general and began but i tel
thee no man shall leave my house and humble
as it is this is now my house while he has
aught to say to me that is to be spoken as this
young man now speaks with a bent brow and a
lofty tone speak out sir and say your worst 
 dear not my temper mrs alice said everard
with equal firmness and placidity manner
 and you sir henry do not think that if
i speak firmly i mean therefore to speak in anger
or officiously you have taxed me with much
and were i guided by the wild spirit romantic
chivalry much which even from so near a relative
i ought not as being by birth and in the
world's estimation a gentleman to pass over
without reply is it your pleasure to give me
patient hearing 
if you stand on your defence answered the
stout old knight god forbid that you should
not challenge a patient hearing ay though your
pleading were two parts disloyalty and one blab
woodstock 
phemy only be brief this has already lasted
but too long
 in the northwest angle it is from a window
in what they call victor lee's apartments
well resumed wildrake i had been
long one lundsford's lads and well used to
patrolling duty so rat me says i if i leave a
light in my rear without knowing what it means
besides mark thou hadst said so much to me
 thy pretty cousin i thought i might as well
have a peep if i could
thoughtless thoughtless incorrigible young
man to what dangers do you expose yourself
and your friends in mere wantonness but goon

by this fair moonshine i believe thou art
jealousy mark everard replied his gay companion
 there is no occasion for in any case i
who was to see the lady was steeled by honour
against the charms my friend's chloe then
the lady was not to see me so could make no
comparisons to thy disadvantage thou knowest 
lastly as it fell out neither us saw the other
at all
 that i am well aware mrs alice left the
lodge long before sunset and never returned
 woodstock
what didst thou see to introduce with such pre
face
 nay no great matter replied wildrake 
only getting upon a sort buttress for i can
climb like any cat that ever mewed in any gutter
and holding on by the vines and creepers
which grew around i obtained a station where i
could see into the inside that same parlour
thou spokes just now
and what saw'st thou there once more demanded
everard
nay no great matter as i said before replied
the cavalier for in these times it is no
new thing to see churls carousing in royal or
noble chambers i saw two stallions engaged
in emptying a solemn stoup strong waters and
dispatching a huge venison pasty which for
their convenience they had placed on a lady's
workingtable one them was trying an air on
a lute
the profane villains exclaimed everard
it was alice's
well said comrade i am glad your phlegm
can be moved i did but throw in these incidents
woodstock 
 the lute and the table to try if it was possible
to get a spark human spirit out you besanctified
as you are
what like were the men said young everard

the one a slouchhatted longcloaked surface
fanatic like the rest you whom i took
to be the steward or commissary i heard spoken
 in the town the other was a short sturdy fellow
with a woodknife at his girdle and a long
quarterstaff lying beside him a blackhaired
knave with white teeth and a merry countenance
 one the underrangers or bowbearers
 these walks i fancy
they must have been desborough's favourite
trusty tomkins said everard and joce
line joliffe the keeper tomkins is desboroughs
right hand an independent and hath pouring
forth as he calls them some think that his gifts
have the better his grace i have heard his
abusing opportunities
they were improving them when i saw
them replied wildrake and made the bottle
smoke for it when as the devil would have
 woodstock
it a stone which had been dislodged from the
crumbling buttress gave way under my weight
a clumsy fellow like thee would have been so
long thinking what was to be done that he
must needs have followed it before he could
make up his mind but i mark i hopped like
a squirrel to an ivy twig and stood fast was
well nigh shot though for the noise alarmed
them both they looked to the oriel and saw me
on the outside the fanatic fellow took out a pistol
 as they have always such texts in readiness
hanging beside the little clasped bible thou
know'st the keeper seized his huntingpole i
treated them both to a roar and a grin thou
must know i can grimace like a baboon i learned
the trick from a french player who could twist
his jaws into a pair nutcrackers and therewithal
i dropped myself sweetly on the grass and
ran off so trippingly keeping the dark side the
wall as long as i could that i am well nigh persuaded
they thought i was their kinsman the
devil come among them uncalled they were
abominably startled
thou art most fearfully rash wildrake
woodstock 
said his companion we are now bound for the
house what if they should remember thee 
why it is no treason is it no one has paid
for peeping since tom coventry's days and
if he came in for a reckoning belike it was fora
better treat than mine but trust me they will
no more know me than a man who had only
seen your friend noll at a conventicle saints
would know the same oliver on horseback and
charging with his lobstertailed squadron or the
same noll cracking a jest and a bottle with
wicked waller the poetae
hush not a word oliver as thou dost
value thyself and me it is ill jesting with the
rock you may split on but here is the gate 
we will disturb these honest gentlemen's recreations

as he spoke he applied the large and ponderous
knocker to the halldoor
rattattattoo said wildrake there is
a fine alarm to you cuckolds and roundheads
he then halfmimicked halfsung the march so
called 
 woodstock
cuckolds come dig cuckolds come dig 
round about cuckolds come dance to my jig 
by heaven this passes midsummer frenzy
said everard turning angrily to him
not a bit not a bit replied wildrake it
is but a slight expectoration just like what one
makes before beginning a long speech i will be
grave for an hour together now i have got that
point war out my head
as he spoke steps were heard in the hall and
the wicket the great door was partly opened
but secured with a chin in case accidents
the visage tomkins and that joceline
beneath it appeared at the chink illuminated by
the lamp which the latter held in his hand and
tomkins demanded the meaning this alarm
i demand instant admittance i said everard
 joliffe you know me well 
i do sirs replied joceline and could admit
you with all my heart but alas sir you
see i am not keykeeper here is the gentleman
whose warrant i must walk by the lord help
me seeing times are such as they be r
i
woodstock 
and when that gentleman who i think maybe
master desborough's valet 
his honour's unworthy secretary an it please
you interposed tomkins while wildrake whispered
in everard's ear i will be no longer secretary
mark thou wert quite right the clerk
must be the more gentlemanly calling
 and if you are master desboroughs secretary
i presume you know me and my condition well
enough said everard addressing the independent
 not to hesitate to admit me and my attendant
to a night's quarters in the lodge 
surely not surely not said the independent
 that is if your worship thinks you would
be better accommodated here than up at the
house entertainment in the town which men
unprofitably call saint george's inn there is
but confined accommodation here your honour
and we have been frayed out our lives already
by the visitation satan albeit his fiery
dart is now quenched
this may be all well in its place sir secretary
said everard and you may find a corner
for it when you are next tempted to play the
i
 woodstock
preacher but i will take it for no apology for
keeping me here in the cold harvest wind and if
not presently received and suitably too i will
report you to your master for insolence in your
office
the secretary desborough did not dare
offer farther opposition for it was well known
that desborough himself only held his consequence
as a kinsman cromwell and the lord
general who was well nigh paramount already
was known to be strongly favourable both to the
elder and younger everard it is true they were
presbyterians and he an independent and that
though sharing those feelings correct morality
and more devoted religious feeling by which
with few exceptions the parliamentarian party
were distinguished the everardss were not disposed
to carry these attributes to the extreme enthusiasm
practised by so many others at the time
yet it was well known that whatever might be
cromwell's own religious creed he was not uniformly
bounded by it in the choice his favourites
but extended his countenance to those who
could serve him even although according to the
woodstock 
phrase the time they came out the darkness
 egypt the character the elder everard
stood very high for wisdom and sagacity besides
being a good family and competent fortune
his adherence would lend a dignity to any side
he might espouse then his son had been a distinguished
and successful soldier remarkable for
the discipline he maintained among his men the
bravery which he showed in the time action
and the humanity with which he was always ready
to qualify the consequences victory such
men were not to be neglected when many signs
combined to show that the parties in the state
who had successfully accomplished the deposition
and death the king were speedily to quarrel
among themselves about the division the spoils
the two everardss were therefore much courted
by cromwell and their influence with him supposed
to be so great that trusty mr secretary
tomkins cared not to expose himself to risk by
contending with colonel everard for such a trifle
as a night's lodging
joceline was active on his side more lights
were obtained more wood thrown on the fire 
vol i k
 woodstock
and the two newlyarrived strangers were introduced
into victor lee's parlour as it was called
from the picture over the chimneypiece which
we have already described it was several minutes
ere colonel everard could recover his general
stoicism deportment so strongly he was
impressed by finding himself in the apartment
under whose roof he had passed so many the
happiest hours his life there was the cabinet
which he had seen opened with such feelings
 delight when sir henry lee deigned to give
him instructions in fishing and to exhibit hooks
and lines together with all the materials for making
the artificial fly then little known there
hung the ancient family picture which from
some odd mysterious expressions his uncle
relating to it had become to his boyhood nay
his early youth a subject curiosity and fear
he remembered how when left alone in the
apartment the searching eye the old warrior
seemed always bent upon his in whatever part
 the room he placed himself and how his childish
imagination was perturbed at a phenomenon
for which he could not account
woodstock 
with these came a thousand more dear and
warmer recollections his early attachment to
his pretty cousin alice when he aided at her
lessons brought water for her flowers or accompanied
her while she sung and he remembered
that while her father looked at them with a goodhumoured
and careless smile he had once heard
him mutter and if it should turn out so why
it might be best for both and the theories 
happiness he had reared on these words all
these visions had been dispelled by the trumpet
 war which called sir henry lee and himself
to opposite sides and the transactions this very
day had shown that even everard's success as a
soldier and a statesman seemed absolutely to prohibit
the chance their being revived
he was waked out this unpleasing reverie
by the approach joceline who being possibly
a seasoned toper had made the additional arrangements
with more expedition and accuracy
than could have been expected from a person
engaged as he had been since nightfall
he now wished to know the colonel's directions
for the night
 woodstock
would he eat anything 
no
 did his honour choose to accept sir henry
lee's bed which was ready prepared 
yes
that mistress alice lee should be prepared
for the secretary
on pain thine ears no replied everard
 where then was the worthy secretary to be
quartered 
in the dogkennel if you list replied colonel
everard but added he stepping to
the sleepingapartment alice which opened
from the parlour locking it and taking out the
key no one shall profane this chamber
had his honour any other commands for the
night 
none save to clear the apartment yonder
man my clerk will remain with me i have
orders which must be written out yet stay
thou gayest my letter this morning to mistress
alice 
 i did
woodstock 
 tell me good joceline what she said when
she received it 
she seemed much concerned sir and indeed
i think that she wept a little but indeed she
seemed very much distressed
 and what message did she send to me 
none may it please your honour she began
to say tell my cousin everard that i will
communicate my uncle's kind purpose to my father
if i can get fitting opportunity but that i
greatly fear and there checked herself as it
were and said i will write to my cousin and
as it may be late ere i have an opportunity 
speaking with my father do thou come for my
answer after service so i went to church myself
to while away the time but when i returned
to the chase i found this man had summoned
my master to surrender and right or wrong i
must put him in possession the lodge i
would fain have given your honour a hint that
the old knight and my young mistress were like
to take you on the form but i could not mend
the matter
thou hast done well good fellow and i will
 woodstock
remember thee and now my masters he said
advancing to the brace clerks or secretaries
who had in the meanwhile sate quietly down beside
the stonebottle and made up acquaintance
over a glass its contents let me remind
you said the colonel that the night wears
late
there is something cries tinkle tinkle in the
bottle yet said wildrake in reply
hem hem hem coughed the colonel 
the parliamentarian service and if his lips did
not curse his companion's imprudence i will not
answer for what arose in his heart well 
he said observing that wildrake had filled his
own glass and tomkins's take that parting
glass and begone
would you not be pleased to hear first
said wildrake how this honest gentleman saw
the devil tonight look through a pane yonder
window and how he thinks he had a mighty
strong resemblance to your worship's humble
slave and varlet scribbler would you but hear
this sir and just sip a glass this very recommendable
strong waters
woodstock 
i will drink none sir said colonel everard
sternly and i have to tell you that you have
drunken a glass too much already mr tompkins
sir i wish you good night
a word in season at parting said tompkins
standing up behind the long leathern back
 a chair hemming and snuffling as if preparing
for an exhortation
excuse me sir replied markham everard
sternly you are not now sufficiently yourself
to guide the devotion others
woe be to them that reject said the secretary
 the commissioners stalking out the
room the rest was lost in shutting the door or
suppressed for fear offence
and n ow fool wildrake begone to thy bed 
yonder it lies pointing to the knight's apartment
what thou hast secured the lady's for thyself
 i saw thee put the key in thy pocket
i would not indeed i could not sleep in
 apartment i can sleep nowhere but i will
watch in this armed chair i have made him place
 wood for repairing the fire good now go to bed
 thyself and sleep off thy liquor
 woodstock
liquor i laugh thee to scorn mark 
thou art a milksop and the son a milksop and
knowest not what a good fellow can do in the way
 crushing an honest cup
the whole vices his faction are in this
poor fellow individually said the colonel to
himself eying his protege askance as the other
retreated into the bedroom with no very steady
pace he is reckless intemperate dissolute 
and if i cannot get him safely shipped for france
he will certainly be both his own ruin and mine 
yet withal he is kind brave and generous and
would have kept the faith with me which he now
expects from me and in what consists the merit
 our truth if we observe not our plighted word
when we have promised to our hurt i will take
the liberty however to secure myself against farther
interruption on his part
so saying he locked the door communication
betwixt the sleepingroom to which the cavalier
had retreated and the parlour and then
after pacing the floor thoughtfully returned to
his seat trimmed the lamp and drew out a number
 letters i will read these over once
woodstock 
more he said that if possible the thought 
public affairs may expel this keen sense personal
sorrow gracious providence where is
this to we have sacrificed the peace our
families the warmest wishes our young hearts
to right the country in which we were born and
to free her from oppression yet it appears that
every step we have made towards liberty has but
brought us in view new and more terrific perils
as he who travels in a mountainous region is by
every step which elevates him highest placed ina
situation more imminent hazard
he read long and attentively various tedious
and embarrassed letters in which the writers
placing before him the glory god and the
freedom and liberties england as their supreme
ends could not by all the ambulatory expressions
they made use prevent the shrewd
eye markham everard from seeing that selfinterest
and views ambition were the principal
moving springs at the bottom their plots
woodstock
chapter 
sleep steals on us even like his brother death
we know not when it comes we know it must come
we may affect to scorn and to contemn it
for tis the highest pride human misery
to say it knows not an opiate 
yet the reft parent the despairing lover
even the poor wretch who waits for execution
feels this oblivion against which he thought
his woes had armed his senses steal upon him
and through the fenceless citadel the body
surprise that haughty garrison the mind
herbert
colonel everard experienced the truth contained
in the verses the quaint old bard whom
we have quoted above amid private grief and
anxiety for a country long a prey to civil war
and not likely to fall soon under any fixed or wellestablished
form government everard and his
father had like many others turned their eyes to
general cromwell as the person whose valour
had made him the darling the army whose
strong sagacity had hitherto predominated over
the high talents by which he had been assailed
woodstock 
in parliament as well as over his enemies in the
field and who was alone in the situation to settle
the station as the phrase then went or in other
words to dictate the mode government the
father and son were both reputed to stand high
in the general's favour but markham everard
was conscious some particulars which induced
him to doubt whether cromwell actually
and at heart bore either to his father or to himself
that goodwill which was generally believed
he knew him for a profound politician who
could veil for any length time his real sentiments
 men and things until they could be displayed
without prejudice to his interest and he
moreover knew that the general was not likely
to forget the opposition which the presbyterian
party had offered to what oliver called the great
matter the trial namely and execution the
king in this opposition his father and he had
anxiously concurred nor had the arguments nor
even the halfexpressed threats cromwell induced
them to flinch from that course far less
to permit their names to be introduced into the
commission nominated to sit in judgment on that
memorable occasion
 woodstock
this hesitation had occasioned some temporary
coldness between the general and the everard
father and son but as the latter remained
in the army and bore arms under cromwell both
in scotland and finally at worcester his services
very frequently called forth the approbation
 his commander after the fight worcester
in particular he was among the number those
officers on whom oliver rather considering the
actual and practical extent his own power than
the name under which he exercised it was with
difficulty withheld from imposing the dignity 
knights bannerets at his own will and pleasure
it therefore seemed that all recollection former
disagreement was obliterated and that the
everardss had regained their former stronghold
in the general's affections there were indeed
several who doubted this and who endeavoured
to bring over this distinguished young officer to
some other the parties which divided the infant
commonwealth but to these proposals he
turned a deaf ear enough blood he said had
been spilled it was time that the nation should
have repose under a firmlyestablished govern
woodstock 
ment strength sufficient to protect property
and lenity enough to encourage the return 
tranquillity this he thought could only be
accomplished by means cromwell and the
greater part england was the same opinion
it was ti'ue that in thus submitting to the domination
 a successful soldier those who did so
forgot the principles upon which they had drawn
the sword against the late king but in revolutions
stern and high principles are often obliged to
give way to the current existing circumstances 
and in many a case where wars have been waged
for points metaphysical right they have been
at last gladly terminated upon the mere hope 
obtaining general tranquillity as after many a
long siege a garrison is often glad to submit on
mere security for life and limb
colonel everard therefore felt that the support
which he afforded cromwell was only under
the idea that amid a choice evils the least
was likely to ensue from a man the general's
wisdom and valour being placed at the head 
the state and he was sensible that oliver himself
was likely to consider his attachment as luke's
woodstock
warm and imperfect and measure his gratitude
for it upon the same limited scale
in the meanwhile however circumstances
compelled him to make trial the generals
friendship the sequestration woodstock and
the warrant to the commissioners to dispose it
as national property had been long granted but
the interest the elder everard had for weeks
and months deferred its execution the hour
was now approaching when the blow could be no
longer parried especially as sir henry lee on
his side resisted every proposal submitting
himself to the existing government and was
therefore now that his hour grace was passed
enrolled in the list stubborn and irreclaimable
malignant with whom the council state was
determined no longer to keep terms the only
mode protecting the old knight and his daughter
was to interest if possible the general himself
in the matter and revolving all the circumstances
connected with their intercourse colonel everard
felt that a request which would so immediately
interfere with the interests desborough the
brotherinlaw cromwell and one the prewoodstock

sent commissioners was putting to a very severe
trial the friendship the latter yet no alternative
remained
with this view and agreeably to a request
from cromwell who at parting had been very
urgent to have his written opinion upon public
affairs colonel everard passed the earlier part
 the night in arranging his ideas upon the state
 the commonwealth in a plan which he thought
likely to be acceptable to cromwell as it exhorted
him under the aid providence to become the
saviour the state by convoking a free parliament
and by their aid placing himself at the head
 some form liberal and established government
which might supersede the estate anarchy
in which the nation was otherwise likely to be
merged taking a general view the totally broken
condition the royalists and the various
factions which now convulsed the state he showed
how this might be done without bloodshed or
violence from this topic he descended to the
propriety keeping up the becoming state the
executive government in whose hands soever it
should be lodged and thus showed cromwell as
the future stadtholder or consul or lieutenants
woodstock
general great britain and ireland a prospect
 demesne and residencies becoming his dignity
then he naturally passed to the dispersing and
destroying the royal residences england
made a woful picture the demolition which impended
over woodstock and interceded for the
preservation that beautiful seat as a matter 
personal favour in which he found himself deeply
interested
colonel everard when he had finished his letter
did not find himself greatly risen in his own
opinion in the course his political conduct
he had till this hour avoided mixing up personal
motives with his public grounds action and
yet he now felt himself making such a composition
but he comforted himself or at least silenced
this unpleasing recollection with the consideration
that the weal britain studied under the
aspect the times absolutely required that
cromwell should be at the head the government
 and that the interest sir henry lee or
rather his safety and his existence no less emphatically
demanded the preservation woodstock
and his residence there was it a fault his that
woods to c 
the same road should lead to both these ends oi
that his private interest and that the country
should happen to mix in the same letter he
hardened himself therefore to the act made up
and addressed his packet to the lord general and
then sealed it with his seal arms this done he
lay back in his chair and in spite his expectations
to the contrary fell asleep in the course
 his reflections anxious and harassing as they
were and did not awaken until the cold grey light
 dawn was peeping through the eastern oriel
he started at first rousing himself with the
sensation one who awakes in a place unknown
to him but the localities instantly forced themselves
on his recollection the lamp burning
dimly in the socket the woodfire almost extinguished
in its own white embers the gloomy
picture over the chimneypiece the sealed packet
on the table all reminded him the events 
yesterday and his deliberations the succeeding
night
there is no help for it he said it must be
cromwell or anarchy and probably the sense
that his title as head the executive governvol
i l
j woodstock
mentis derived merely from popular consent may
check the too natural proneness power to render
itself arbitrary if he govern by parliaments
and with regard to the privileges the subject
wherefore not oliver as well as charles but i
must take measures for having this conveyed
safely to the hands this future sovereign prince
it will be well to take the first word influence
with him since there must be many who will not
hesitate to recommend counsels more violent and
precipitate
he determined to intrust the important packet
to the charge wildrake whose rashness was
never so distinguished as when by any chance he
was left idle and unemployed besides even if
his faith had not been otherwise unimpeachable
the obligations which he owed to his friend everard
must have rendered it such
these conclusions passed through colonel everard's
mind as collecting the remains wood in
the chimney he gathered them into a hearty blaze
to remove the uncomfortable feeling chillness
which pervaded his limbs and by the time he
was a little more warm again sunk into a slumber
woodstock 
which was only dispelled by the beams morning
peeping into his apartment
he arose roused himself walked up and down
the room and looked from the large oriel windows
on the nearest objects which were the untrimmed
hedges and neglected walks a certain
wilderness as it is called in ancient treatises on
gardening which kept yore well ordered and
in all the pride the topiary art presented a
succession yew trees cut into fantastic forms
 close alleys and open walks filling about
two or three acres ground on that side the
lodge and forming a boundary between its immediate
precincts and the open park its enclosure
was now broken down in many places and
the hinds with their fawns fed free and startled
up to the very windows the sylvan palace
this had been a favourite scene markham's
sports when a boy he could still distinguish
though now grown out shape the verdant
battlements a gothic castle all created by the
gardener's shears at which he was accustomed to
shoot his arrows or stalking before it like the
knighterrant whom he read was wont 
 woodstock
blow his horn and bid defiance to the supposed
giant or paynim knight by whom it was garrisoned
he remembered how he used to train his
cousin though several years younger than himself
to bear a part in these revels his boyish
fancy and to play the character an elfin page
or a fairy or an enchanted princess he remembered
too many particulars their later
acquaintance from which he had been almost
necessarily led to the conclusion that from an
early period their parents had entertained some
idea that there might be a wellfitted match betwixt
his fair cousin and himself a thousand
visions formed in so bright a prospect had vanished
along with it but now returned like shadows
to remind him all he had lost and for what 
 for the sake england his proud consciousness
replied england in danger 
becoming the prey at once bigotry and tyranny
and he strengthened himself with the recollection
 if i have sacrificed my private happiness
it is that my country may enjoy liberty
 conscience and personal freedom which under
woodstock 
 weak prince and usurping statesmen she was
but too likely to have lost
but the busy fiend in his breast would not be
repulsed by the bold answer has thy resistance
it demanded availed thy country markham
everard lies not england after so much
bloodshed and so much misery as low beneath
the sword a fortunate soldier as formerly under
the sceptre an encroaching prince are
parliament or what remains them fitted to
contend with a leader master his soldiers
hearts as bold and subtle as he is impenetrable
in his designs this general who holds the
army and by that the fate the nation in his
hand will he lay down his power because philosophy
would pronounce it his duty to become a
subject 
he dared not answer that his knowledge 
cromwell authorized him to expect any such
act selfdenial yet still he considered that
in times such infinite difficulty that must bethe
best government however little desirous in
itself which should most speedily restore peace
to the land and stop the wounds which the 
woodstock
tending parties were daily inflicting on each other
he imagined that cromwell was the only authority
under which a steady government could be
formed and therefore had attached himself to his
fortune though not without considerable and recurring
doubts how far serving the views this
impenetrable and mysterious general was consistent
with the principles under which he had
assumed arms
while these things passed in his mind everard
looked upon the packet which lay on the table
addressed to the lord general and which he had
made up before sleep he hesitated several times
when he remembered its purport and in what
degree he must stand committed with that personage
and bound to support his plans aggrandizement
when once that communication was in
oliver croraweirs possession
yet it must be so he said at last with a
deep sigh among the contending parties he
is the strongest the wisest and most moderate
and ambitious though he be perhaps not the
most dangerous some one must be trusted with
power to preserve and enforce general order and
woodstock 
who can possess or wield such power like him
that is head the victorious armies england 
come what will in future peace and the restoration
 law ought to be our first and most pressing
object this remnant a parliament cannot
keep their ground against the army by mere appeal
to the sanction opinion if they design to
reduce the soldiery it must be by actual warfare
and the land has been too long steeped in blood
but cromwell may and i trust will make a moderate
accommodation with them on grounds by
which peace may be preserved and it is to this
which we must look and trust for a settlement 
the kingdom alas f and for the chance protecting
my obstinate kinsman from the consequences
 his honest though absurd pertinacity
silencing some internal feelings doubt and
reluctance by such reasoning as this markham
everard continued in his resolution to unite himself
with cromwell in the struggle which was
evidently approaching betwixt the civil and military
authorities not as the course which if at
perfect liberty he would have preferred adopting
but as the best choice between two dangerous
 woodstock
extremities to which the times had reduced him
he could not help trembling however when he
recollected that his father though hitherto the
admirer cromwell as the implement by whom
so many marvels had been wrought in england
might not be disposed to unite with his interest
against that the long parliament which
he had been till partly laid aside by continued
indisposition an active and leading member
this doubt also he was obliged to swallow or
strangle as he might but consoling himself with
the ready argument that it was impossible his
father could see matters in another light than
that in which they occurred to himself
woodstock 
chapter vii
determined at length to dispatch his packet
to the general without delay colonel everard
approached the door the apartment in which
as was evident from the dead breathing within the
prisoner wildrake enjoyed a deep slumber under
the influence liquor at once and fatigue in
turning the key the bolt which was rather rusty
made a resistance so noisy as partly to attract
the sleepers attention though not to awake him
everard stood by his bedside as he heard him
mutter is it morning already jailor why
you dog an you had but a cast humanity in
you you would qualify your vile news with a cup
 sack hanging is sorry work my masters 
and sorrow's dry
up wildrake up thou illomened dreamers
said his friend shaking him by the collar

 woodstock
hands off answered the sleeper i can
climb a ladder without help i trow he then
sate up in the bed and opening his eyes stared
around him and exclaimed zounds mark is
it only thou i thought it was all over with me
fetters were struck from my legs rope drawn
round my gullet irons knocked off my hands
hempen cravat tucked on all ready for a dance
in the open element upon slight footing
truce with thy folly wildrake sure the
devil drink to whom thou hast i think sold
thyself 
for a hogshead sack interrupted wildrake
 the bargain was made in a cellar in the
wintry
i am as mad as thou art to trust anything
to thee said markham i scarce believe thou
hast thy senses yet
what should ail me said wildrake i
trust i have not tasted liquor in my sleep saving
that i dreamed drinking smallbeer with old
noll his own brewing but do not look so
glum manpi am the same roger wildrake
that i ever was as wild as a mallard but as true
woodstock 
as a gamecock i am thine own chum manbound
to thee by thy kind deedsvinctus he
nefido there is latin for it and where is the
thing thou wilt charge me with that i will not
or dare not execute were it to pick the devil's
teeth with my rapier after he had breakfasted
upon roundheads 
 you will drive me mad said everard 
when i am about to intrust all i have most
valuable on earth to your management your conduct
and language are those a mere bedlamite
last night i made allowance for thy drunken
fury but who can endure thy morning madness 
sit is unsafe for thyself and me wildrake sit
is unkind i might say ungrateful
nay do not say that my friend said the
cavalier with some show feeling and do not
judge me with a severity that cannot apply to
such as i am we who have lost our all in these
sad jars who are compelled to shift for our living
not from day to day but from meal to meal we
whose only hidingplace is the jail whose prospect
 final repose is the gallows what can'st
thou expect from us but to bear such a lot with
 woodstock
a light heart since we should break down under
it with a heavy one 
this was spoken in a tone feeling which
found a responding string in everard's bosom
he took his friend's hand and pressed it kindly
nay if i seemed harsh to thee wild rake
i profess it was for thine own sake more than
mine i know thou hast at the bottom thy
levity as deep a principle honour and feeling
as ever governed a human heart but thou art
thoughtless thou art rash and i protest to
thee that wert thou to betray thyself in this matter
in which i trust thee the evil consequences
to myself would not afflict me more than the
thought putting thee into such danger
nay if you take it on that tone mark
said the cavalier making an effort to laugh evidently
that he might conceal a tendency to a different
emotion thou wilt make children us
both babes and sucklings by the hilt this
bilbo come trust me i can be cautious when
time requires it no man ever saw me drink
when an alert was expected and not one poor
pint wine will i taste until i have managed
woodstock s
this matter for thee well i am thy secretary 
clerk i had forgot and carry thy dispatches to
cromwell taking good heed not to be surprised
or choused out my lump loyalty striking
his finger on the packet and i am to deliver it
to the most loyal hands to which it is most humbly
addressed zooks mark think it a
moment longersurely thou wilt not carry thy
perverseness so far as to strike in with this
bloodyminded rebel bid me give him three
inches my dudgeondagger and i will do if
much more willingly than present him with thy
packets
go to replied everard this is beyond
our bargain if you will help me it is well if not
let me lose no time in debating with thee since
i think every moment an age till the packet is in
the generals possession it is the only way left
me to obtain some protection and a place refuge
for my uncle and his daughter
 that being the case said the cavalier i
will not spare the spur my nag up yonder at
the town will be ready for the road in a trice
and thou mayst reckon on my being with old
t woodstock
noll thy general i mean in as short time as
man and horse may consume betwixt woodstock
and windsor where i think i shall for the present
find thy friend keeping possession where he
has slain
 hush not a word that since we parted
last night i have shaped thee a path which will
suit thee better than to assume the decency 
language and outward manner which thou
hast so little i have acquainted the general that
thou hast been by bad example and bad education

which is to be interpreted by contraries
i hope said wildrake for sure i have been
as well born and bred up as any lad leicestershire
might desire
now i prithee hush thou hast i say by
bad example become at one time a malignant
and mixed in the party the late king but
seeing what things were wrought in the nation by
the general thou hast come to a clearness touching
his calling to be a great implement in the
settlement these distracted kingdoms this
account thee will not only lead him to pass
woodstock 
over some thy eccentricities should they
break out in spite thee but will also give thee
an interest with him as being more especially attached
to his own person 
doubtless said wildrake as every fisher
loves best the trouts that are his own tickling

 it is likely i think he will send thee hither
with letters to me said the colonel enabling
me to put a stop to the proceedings these sequestrators
and to give poor old sir henry lee
permission to linger out his days among the oaks
he loves to look upon i have made it my request
to him and i think my father's friendship
and my own may stretch so far on his regard
without risk cracking especially standing matters
as they now do thou dost understand 
entirely well said the cavalier stretch
quotha i would rather stretch a rope than hold
commerce with the old kingkilling ruffian but
i have said i will be guided by thee markham
and rat me but i will
be cautious then said everard mark
well what he does and says more especially what
p woopstoclc
he does for oliver is one those whose mind
is better known by his actions than by his words
and stay i warrant thee thou wert setting off
without a cross in thy purse 
too true mark said wildrake the last
noble melted last night amongst yonder blackguard
troopers yours
 weil roger replied the colonel that is
easily mended so saying he slipped his purse
into his friend's hand but art thou not an inconsequential
weatherbrained fellow to set forth
as thou wert about to do without anything to bear
thy charges what could'st thou have done
faith i never thought that i must have
cried standi i suppose to the first pursy townsman
or greasy grazier that i met o the heath it
is many a good fellow's shift in these bad times
go to said everard be cautious use
none your loose acquaintance rule your
tongue beware the winepot for there is
little danger if thou could'st only but keep thyself
sober be moderate in speech and forbear
oaths or vaunting
 in short metamorphose myself into such a
u
woodstock 
prig as thou art mark well said wildrake
 so far as outside will go i think i can make
a hopeonhigh bomhy as well as thou canst
ah those were merry days when we saw mills
present bombay at the fortune playhouse mark
ere i had lost my laced cloak and the jewel in my
ear or thou hadst gotten the wrinkle on thy brow
and the puritanic twist thy mustachio 
they were like most worldly pleasures wildrake
replied everard sweet in the mouth and
bitter in digestion but away with thee and
when thou bring'st back my answer thou wilt
find me either here or at saint george's inn at
the little borough good luck to thee be but
cautious how thou dearest thyself
the colonel remained in deep meditation 
 i think he said i have not pledged myself
too far to the general a breach between him
and the parliament seems inevitable and would
throw england back into civil war which all
men are wearied he may dislike my messenger
 a puritanic character in one beaumont and fletchers
plays
vol i k
 woodstock
yet that i do not greatly fear he knows i
would choose such as i can myself depend on
and hath dealt enough with the stricter sort to
be aware that there are among them as well as
elsewhere men who can hide two faces under
one hood
woodstock 
chapter viii
for there in lofty air was seen to stand
the stern protector the conquered land 
drawn in that look with which he wept and swore
turn'd out the members and made fast the door
ridding the house every knave and drone
forced though it grieve his soul to rule alone
the frank courtship crabbe
leaving colonel everard to his meditations
we follow the jolly cavalier his companion who
before mounting at the george did not fail to
treat himself to his morningdraught eggs and
muscadine to enable him to face the harvest
wind
although he had suffered himself to be sunk
in the extravagant license which was practised
by the cavaliers as if to oppose their conduct in
every point to the preciseness their enemies
 woodstock
yet wildrake wellborn and welleducated and
endowed with good natural parts and a heart
which even debauchery and the wild life a
roaring cavalier had not been able entirely to
corrupt moved on his present embassy with a
strange mixture feelings such as perhaps he
had never in his life before experienced
his feelings as a royalist led him to detest cromwell
whom in other circumstances he would scarce
have wished to see except in a field battle
where he could have had the pleasure to exchange
pistolshots with him but with this hatred there
was mixed a certain degree fear always victorious
wherever he fought the remarkable person
whom wildrake was now approaching had
acquired that influence over the minds his enemies
which constant success is so apt to inspire
they dreaded while they hated him and joined
to these feelings was a restless meddling curiosity
which made a particular feature in wildrakes
character who having long had little business
 his own and caring nothing about that
which he had was easily attracted by the desire
woodstock 
 seeing whatever was curious or interesting
around him
i should like to see the old rascal after all
he said were it but to say that i had seen him
he reached windsor in the afternoonand
felt on his arrival the strongest inclination to
take up his residence at some his old haunts
when he had occasionally frequented that fair
town in gayer days but resisting all temptations
 this kind he went courageously to the principal
inn from which its ancient emblem the
garter had long disappeared the master too
whom wildrake experienced in his knowledge
 landlords and hostelries had remembered a
dashing mine host queen bess's school had
now sobered down to the temper the times
shook his head when he spoke the parliament
wielded his spigot with the gravity a priest
conducting a sacrifice wished england a happy
issue out all her afflictions and greatly lauded
his excellency the lord general wildrake
also remarked that his wine was better than it
was wont to be the puritans having an excellent
gift at detecting every fallacy in that matter
 woodstock
and that his measures were less and his charges
larger circumstances which he was induced to
attend to by mine host talking a good deal about
his conscience
he was told by this important personage that
the lord general received frankly all sorts 
persons and that he might obtain access to him
next morning at eight o'clock for the trouble 
presenting himself at the castlegate and announcing
himself as the bearer dispatches to his
excellency
to the castle the disguised cavalier repaired
at the hour appointed admittance was freely
permitted to him by the redcoated soldier who
with austere looks and his musket on his shoulder
mounted guard at the external gate that
noble building wildrake passed through the
under ward or court gazing as he passed upon
the beautiful chapel which had but lately received
in darkness and silence the unhonoured
remains the slaughtered king england
rough as wildrake was the recollection 
this circumstance affected him so strongly that
lie had nearly turned back in a sort horror
woodstock 
rather than face the dark and daring man to
whom amongst all the actors in that melancholyaffair
its tragic conclusion was chiefly to be imputed
but he felt the necessity subduing all
sentiments this nature and compelled himself
to proceed in a negotiation intrusted to his conduct
by one to whom he was so much obliged as colonel
everard at the ascent which passed by the
round tower he looked to the ensignstaff from
which the banner england was wont to float
it was gone with all its rich emblazonry its gorgeous
quarterings and splendid embroidery and
in its room waved that the commonwealth
the cross saint george in its colours blue
and red not yet intersected by the diagonal cross
 scotland which was soon after assumed in
evidence england's conquest over her ancient
enemy this change ensigns increased the train
 his gloomy reflections in which although contrary
to his wont he became so deeply wrapped
that the first thing which recalled him to himself
was the challenge from the sentinel accompanied
with a stroke the butt his musket on the
 woodstock
pavement with an emphasis which made wildrake
start
whither away and who are you
the bearer a packet answered wildrake
to the worshipful the lord general 
stand till i call the officer the guard
the corporal made his appearance distinguished
above those his command by a double
quantity band round his neck a double
height steeplecrowned hat a larger allowance
 cloak and a treble proportion sour gravity
 aspect it might be read on his countenance
that he was one those tremendous enthusiasts
to whom oliver owed his conquests whose religious
zeal made them even more than a match for
the highspirited and highborn cavaliers who
exhausted their valour in vain in defence their
sovereign's person and crown he looked with
grave solemnity at wildrake as if he was making
in his own mind an inventory his features and
dress and having fully perused them he required
 to know his business
my business said wildrake as firmly as he
could for the close investigation this man had
woodstock 
given him some unpleasant nervous sensations
 ray business is with your general
with his excellency the lord general thou
would'st say replied the corporal thy
speech my friend savours too little the reverence
due to his excellency
 d n his excellency was at the lips the
cavalier but prudence kept guard and permitted
not the offensive words to escape the barrier he
only bowed and was silent
 follow me said the starched figure whom
he addressed and wildrake followed him accordingly
into the guardhouse which exhibited an
interior characteristic the times and very different
from what such military stations present
at the present day
by the fire sat two or three musketeers listening
to one who was expounding some religious mystery
to them he began half beneath his breath
but in tones great volubility which tones as he
approached the conclusion became sharp and eager
as challenging either instant answer or silent
acquiescence the audience seemed to listen to
the speaker with immovable features only answering
him with clouds tobaccosmoke which
 woodstock
they rolled from under their thick mustachios on
a bench lay a soldier on his face whether asleep
or in a hit contemplation k was impossible to
decide in the midst the floor stood an officer
as he seemed by his embroidered shoulderbelt and
scarf round his waist otherwise very plainly attired
who was engaged in drilling a stout bumpkin
lately enlisted to the manual as it was then
used the motions and words command were
twenty at the very least and until they were
regularly brought to an the corporal did not
permit wildrake either to sit down or move forward
beyond the threshold the guardhouse
so he had to listen in succession to poize your
musket rest your musket cock your musket
handle your primers and many other forgotten
words discipline until at length the words
 order your musket ended the drill for the
time
thy name friend said the officer to the
recruit when the lesson was over
ephraim answered the fellow with an affect
ed twang through the nose
 and what besides ephraim 

woodstock 
 ephraim cobb from the godly city glocester
where i have dwelt for seven years serving
apprentice to a praise worthy cordwainer
it is a goodly craft answered the officer 
 but casting in thy lot with ours doubt not that
thou shalt be set beyond thine awl and thy last
to boot
a grim smile the speaker accompanied this
poor attempt at a pun and then turning round
to the corporal who stood two paces off with the
face one who seemed desirous speaking
said how now corporal what tidings 
 here is one with a packet and please your
excellency said the corporal surely my
spirit does not rejoice in him seeing i esteem him
as a wolf in sheep's clothing
by these words wildrake learned that he was
in the actual presence the remarkable person
to whom he was commissioned and he paused
to consider in what manner he ought to address
him
the figure oliver cromwell was as is generally
known in no way prepossessing he
was middle stature strong and coarsely made
with harsh and severe features indicative how
 woodstock
ever much natural sagacity and depth 
thought his eyes were grey and piercing his
nose too large in proportion to his other features
his manner speaking when he had the purpose
to make himself distinctly understood was
energetic and forcible though neither graceful
nor eloquent no man could on such occasion
put his meaning into fewer and more decisive
words but when as it often happened he had
a mind to play the orator for the benefit peoples
ears without enlightening their understanding
cromwell was wont to invest his meaning or
that which seemed to be his meaning in such a
mist words surrounding it with so many exclusions
and exceptions and fortifying it with such a
labyrinth parentheses that though one the
most shrewd men in england he was perhaps
tho most unintelligible speaker that ever perplexed
an audience it has been long since said by
the historian that a collection the protector's
speeches would make with a few exceptions the
most nonsensical in the world but he ought
to have added that nothing could be more nervous
concise and intelligible than what he really
intended should be understood
woodstock 
it was also remarked cromwell that though
born a good family both by father and mother
and although he had the usual opportunities 
education and breeding connected with such an
advantage the fanatic democratic ruler could
never acquire or else disdained to practise the
courtesies usually exercised among the higher
classes in their intercourse with each other his
demeanour was so blunt as sometimes might be
termed clownish yet there was in his language
and manner a force and energy corresponding to
his character which impressed awe if it did not
impose respect and there were even times when
that dark and subtle spirit expanded itself so as
almost to conciliate affection the turn for humour
which displayed itself by fits was broad
and a low and sometimes practical character
something there was in his disposition congenial
to that his countrymen a contempt folly a
hatred affectation and a dislike ceremony
which joined to the strong intrinsic qualities 
sense and courage made him in many respects
not an unfit representative the democracy 
england
his religion must always be a subject much
 woodstock
doubt and probably doubt which he himself
could hardly have cleared up unquestionably
there was a time in his life when he was sincerely
enthusiastic and when his natural temper slightly
subject to hypochondria was strongly agitated
by the same fanaticism which influenced so
many persons the time on the other hand
there were periods during his political career
when we certainly do him no injustice in charging
him with hypocritical affectation we shall
probably judge him and others the same age
most truly if we suppose that their religious
professions were partly influential in their own
breast partly assumed in compliance with their
own interest and so ingenious is the human
heart in deceiving itself as well as others that it
is probable neither cromwell himself nor those
making similar pretensions to distinguished piety
could exactly have fixed the point at which their
enthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced
 or rather it was a point not fixed in itself
but fluctuating with the state health 
good or bad fortune high or low spirits affecting
the individual at the period
such was the celebrated person who turning
woodstock 
round on wildrake and scanning his countenance
closely seemed so little satisfied with what
he beheld that he instinctively hitched forward
his belt so as to bring the handle his tucksword
within his reach but yet folding his arms
in his cloak as if upon second thoughts laying
aside suspicion or thinking precaution beneath
him he asked the cavalier what he was and whence
he came 
a poor gentleman sir that is my lord
answered wildrake last from woodstock
and what may your tidings be sir gentleman
 said cromwell with an emphasis truly
i have seen those most willing to take upon
them that title bear themselves somewhat short
 wise men and good men and true men withall
their gentility yet gentleman was a good
title in old england when men remembered what
it was construed to mean
you say truly sir replied wildrake suppressing
with difficulty some his usual wild
expletives v formerly gentlemen were found in
gentlemen's places but now the world is so changed
that you shall find the broidered belt has
changed place with the under spur leather

woodstock
say'st thou me said the general i profess
thou art a bold companion that can bandy
words so wantonly thou king's somewhat too
loud to be good metal methinks and once
again what are thy tidings with me 
this packet said wildrake commended
to your hands by colonel markham everard
alas i must have mistaken thee answered
cromwell mollified at the mention a man's
name whom he had great desire to make his
own forgive us good friend for such we
doubt not thou art sit thee down and commune
with thyself as thou mayst until we have
examined the contents thy packet let him
be looked to and have what he lacks so saying
the general left the guardhouse where
wildrake took his seat in the corner and awaited
with patience the issue his mission
the soldiers now thought themselves obliged to
treat him with more consideration and offered him
a pipe trinidad and a black jack filled with
october but the look cromwell and the dangerous
situation in which he might be placed by
the least chance detection induced wildrake to
woodstock 
decline these hospitable offers and stretching
back in his chair and affecting slumber he escaped
notice or conversation until a sort aiddecamp
or military officer in attendance came
to summon him to cromwelps presence
by this person he was guided to a posterngate
through which he entered the body the
castle and penetrating through many private
passages and staircases he at length was introduced
into a small cabinet or parlour in which
was much rich furniture some bearing the royal
cypher displayed but all confused and disarranged
together with several paintings in massive
frames having their faces turned towards the wall
as if they had been taken down for the purpose
 being removed
in this scene disorder the victorious general
 the commonwealth was seated in a large
easy chair covered with damask and deeply
embroidered the splendour which made a
strong contrast with the plain and even homely
character his apparel although in look and
action he seemed like one who felt that the seat
which might have in former days held a prince
vol i n
 woodstock
was not too much distinguished for his own fortunes
and ambition wildrake stood before him
nor did he ask him to sit down
 pearson said cromwell addressing himself
to the officer in attendance wait in the gallery
but be within call pearson bowed and was
retiring w ho are in the gallery besides 
worthy mr gordon the chaplain was holding
forth but now to colonel overtop and four
captains your excellency's regiment
we would have it so said the general 
we would not there were any corner in our
dwelling where the hungry soul might not meet
with manna was the good man carried onward
in his discourse 
mightily borne through said pearson
 and he was touching the rightful claims which
the army and especially your excellency hath
acquired by becoming the instruments in the
great work not instruments to be broken asunder
and cast away when the day their service
is over but to be preserved and held precious
and prized for their honourable and faithful labours
for which they have fought and marched
woodstock 
and fasted and prayed and suffered cold and
sorrow while others who would now gladly see
them disbanded and broken and cashiered eat
 the fat and drink the strong
ah good man said cromwell and did
he touch upon this so feelingly i could say
something but not now begone pearson to
the gallery let not our friends lay aside their
swords but watch as well as pray
pearson retired and the general holding the
letter everard in his hand looked again fora
long while fixedly at wildrake as if considering
in what strain he should address him
when he did speak it was at first in one 
those ambiguous discourses which behave already
described and by which it was very difficult for
any one to understand his meaning if indeed
he knew it himself we shall be as concise in
our statement as our desire to give the very
words a man so extraordinary will permit
this letter he said you have brought
us from your master or patron markham everard
 truly an excellent and honourable gentleman
as ever bore a sword upon his thigh and
 woodstock
one who hath ever distinguished himself in the
great work delivering these three poor and
unhappy nations answer me not i know what
thou would'st say and this letter he hath sent
to me by thee his clerk or secretary in whom
he hath confidence and in whom he prays me to
have trust that there may be a careful messenger
between us and lastly he hath sent thee
to me do not answer i know what thou
would'st say to me who albeit i am that
small consideration that it would be too much
honour for me even to bear a albert in this
great and victorious army england am nevertheless
exalted to the rank holding the guidance
and the leadingstaff thereof nay do not
answer my friend i know what thou would'st
say now when communing thus together our
discourse taketh in respect to what i have said
a threefold argument or division first as it
concerned thy master secondly as it concerned
us and our office thirdly and lastly as it
touched thyself now as concerning this good
and worthy gentleman colonel markham everard
truly he hath played the man from the bewoodstock

ginning these unhappy buffetings not turning
to the right or to the left but holding ever in
his eye the mark at which he aimed ay truly
a faithful honourable gentleman and one who
may well call me friend and truly i am pleased
to think that he doth so nevertheless in this
vale tears we must be governed less by our
private respects and partialities than by those
higher principles and points duty whereupon
the good colonel markham everard hath ever
framed his purposes as truly i have endeavoured
to form mine that we may all act as becometh
good englishmen and worthy patriots
then as for woodstock it is a great thing which
the good colonel asks that it should be taken
from the spoil the godly and left in keeping
 the men moab and especially the malignant
henry lee whose hand hath been ever
against us when he might find room to raise it 
i say he hath asked a great thing both in respect
 himself and me for we this poor but
godly army england are holden by these
 the parliament as men who should render in
spoil for them but be no sharer it ourselves 
even as the buck which the hounds pull to earth
 woodstock
furmsheth no part their own food but they are
lashed off from the carcase with whips like those
which require punishment for their forwardness
not reward for their services yet i speak not
this so much in respect this grant woodstock
in regard that perhaps their lordships
 the council and also the committeemen 
this parliament may graciously think they have
given me a portion in the matter in relation that
my kinsman desborough hath an interest allowed
him therein which interest as he hath well deserved
it for his true and faithful service to these
unhappy and devoted countries so it would ill
become me to diminish the same to his prejudice
unless it were upon great and public respects
thus thou seest how it stands with me my honest
friend and in what mind i stand touching
this thy master's request to me which yet i do
not say that i can altogether or unconditionally
grant or refuse but only tell my simple thoughts
with regard thereto thou understands me i
doubt not
now roger wildrake with all the attention
he had been able to pay to the lord general's
speech had got so much confused among the
woodstock 
various clauses the harangue that his brainwas
bewildered like that a country clown
when he chances to get himself involved among
a crowd carriages and cannot stir a step to
get out the way one's them without being
in danger being ridden over by the others
the general saw his look perplexity and
began a new oration to the same purpose as before
 spoke his love for his kind friend the
colonel his regard for his pious and godly
kinsman master desborough the great importance
 the palace and park woodstock the
determination the parliament that it should
be confiscated and the produce brought into the
coffers the state his own deep veneration for
the authority parliament and his no less deep
sense the injustice done to the army how it
was his wish and will that all matters should be
settled in an amicable and friendly manner without
selfseeking debate or strife betwixt those
who had been the hands acting and such as
had been the heads governing in that great national
cause how he was willing truly willing
to contribute to this work by laying down not
his commission only but his life also if it were
 woodstock
requested him or could be granted with safety
to the poor soldiers to whom silly poor men he
was bound to be as a father seeing that they
had followed him with the duty and affection 
children
and here he arrived at another dead pause
leaving wildrake as uncertain as before whether
it was or was not his purpose to grant
colonel everard the powers he had asked for
the protection woodstock against the parliamentary
commissioners internally he began
to entertain hopes that the justice heaven or
the effects remorse had confounded the regicide's
understanding but no he could see
nothing but sagacity in that steady stern eye
which while the tongue poured forth its periphrastic
language in such profusion seemed to
watch with severe accuracy the effect which his
oratory produced on the listener
egad thought the cavalier to himself
becoming a little familiar with the situation in
which he was placed and rather impatient a
conversation which led to no visible conclusion
or termination if noll were the devil himself
woodstock 
as he is the devil's darling i will not be thus
noseled by him i'll e'en brusque it a little if
he goes on at this rate and try if i can bring
him to a more intelligible mode speaking
entertaining this bold purpose but half afraid
to execute it wildrake lay by for an opportunity
 making the attempt while cromwell was
apparently unable to express his own meaning
he was already beginning a third panegyric upon
colonel everard with sundry varied expressions
 his own wish to oblige him when wildrake
took the opportunity a pause to strike in on
the general's making one his oratorical pauses
so please you he said bluntly your word
ship has already spoken on two topics your
discourse your own worthiness and that my
master colonel everard but to enable me todo
mine errand it would be necessary to bestow
a few words on the third head
the third said cromwell
ay said wildrake which in your honour's
subdivision your discourse touched on
my unworthy self what am i to do what portion
am i to have in this matter 
 woodstock
oliver started at once from the tone voice he
had hitherto used and which somewhat resembled
the purring a domestic cat into the growl
 the tiger when about to spring thy portion
jailbird he exclaimed the gallows 
thou shalt hang as high as human if thou betray
counsel but he added softening his voice
keep it like a true man and my favour will bethe
making thee come hither thou art bold
i see though somewhat saucy thou hast been a
malignant so writes my worthy friend colonel
everard but thou hast now given up that falling
cause i tell thee friend not all that the parliament
or the army could do would have pulled
down the stuart out their high places saving
that heaven had a controversy with them well
it is a sweet and comely thing to buckle on one's
armour in behalf heaven's cause otherwise
truly for mine own part these men might have
remained upon the throne even unto this day
neither do i blame any for aiding them until
these successive great judgments have overwhelmed
them and their house i am not a
bloody man having in me the feeling human
woodstock 
frailty but friend whosoever putteth his hand
to the plough in the great actings which are now
on foot in these nations had best beware that
they do not look back for rely upon my simple
word that if you fail me i will not spare on you
one foot's length the gallows human let
me therefore know at a word if the leaven thy
malignancy is altogether drubbed out thee 
your honourable lordship said the cavalier
shrugging up his shoulders has done that
for most us so far as cudgelling to some tune
can perform it
say'st thou said the general with a grim
smile on his lip which seemed to intimate that
he was not quite inaccessible to flattery yea
truly thou dost not lie in that we have been an
instrument neither are we as i have already
hinted so severely bent against those who have
striven against us as malignant as others may be
the parliamentmen best know their own interest
and their own pleasure but to my poor
thinking it is full time to close these jars and to
allow men all kinds the means doing service
to their country and we think it will be thy fault
sod
woodstock
if thou art not employed to good purpose for the
state and thyself on condition thou protest away
the old man entirely from thee and gives thy
earnest attention to what i have to tell thee
your lordship need not doubt my attentions
said the cavalier
and the republican general after another
pause as one who gave his confidence not without
hesitation proceeded to explain his views
with a distinctness which he seldom used yet
not without his being a little biassed now and
then by'his long habits circumlocution which
indeed he seldom laid entirely aside save in the
field battle
thou seest he said my friend how
things stand with me the parliament i care
not who knows it love me not still less do the
council state by whom they manage the executive
government the kingdom i cannot
tell why they nourish suspicion against me unless
it is because i will not deliver this poor innocent
army which has followed me in so many
military actions to be now pulled asunder broken
piecemeal and reduced so that they who
woodstock 
have protected the state at the expense their
blood will not have perchance the means 
feeding themselves by their labour which methinks
were hard measure since it is taking
from esau his birthright even without giving
him a poor mess pottage
esau is likely to help himself i think replied
wildrake
truly thou say'st wisely replied the general
 it is ill starving an armed man if there
is food to be had for taking nevertheless far be
it from me to encourage rebellion or want due
subordination to these our rulers i would only
petition in a due and becoming a sweet and harmonious
manner that they would listen to our
conditions and consider our necessities but sir
looking on me and esteeming m so little as they
do you must think that it would be a provocation
in me towards the council state as well
as the parliament if simply to gratify your worthy
master i were to act contrary to their purposes
or deny currency to the commission under
their authority which is as yet the highest
in the state and long may it be so for me to
carry on the sequestration which they intend
soc woodstock
and would it not also be said that i was lending
myself to the malignant interest affording this
den the bloodthirsty and lascivious tyrants 
yore to be in this our day a place refuge to
that old and inveterate amalekite sir henry lee
to keep possession the place in which he hath
so long glorified himself truly it would be a
perilous matter
 am i then to reports said wild rake an
if it please you that you cannot stead colonel
everard in this matter 
 unconditionally aybut taken conditionally
the answer may be otherwise answered
cromwell i see thou art not able to fathom
my purpose and therefore i will partly unfold
it to thee but take notice that should thy
tongue betray my council save in so far as carrying
it to thy master by all the blood which has
been shed in these wild times thou shalt die a
thousand deaths in one 
do not fear me sir said wildrake whose
natural boldness and carelessness character was
for the present time borne down and quelled like
that falcons in the presence the eagle
hear me then said cromwell and let
woodstock son
no syllable escape thee knowest thou not the
young lee whom they call albert a malignant
like his father and one who went up with the
young man to that last ruffle which we had with
him at worcester may we be grateful for the
victory 
i know there is such a young gentleman as
albert lee said wildrake
and knowest thou not i speak not by way
 prying into the good coroners secrets but only
as it behoves me to know something the matter
that i may best judge how i am to serve him 
knowest thou not that thy master markham
everard is a suitor after the sister this same
malignant a daughter the old keeper called
sir henry lee 
all this i have heard said wildrake nor
can i deny that i believe in it
well then go to when the young man
charles stuart fled from the field worcester
and was by sharp chase and pursuit compelled to
separate himself from his followers i know by
sure intelligence that this albert lee was one 
the last who remained with him if not indeed the
very last
 woodstock
it was devilish like him said the cavalier
without sufficiently weighing his expressions considering
in what presence they were to be uttered
 and i'll uphold him with my rapier to bea
true chip the old block
ha dearest thou said the general is
this thy reformation 
i never swear so please you replied wildrake
recollecting himself except there is some
mention malignant and cavaliers in my hearing
 and then the old habit returns and i swear
like one goring's troopers
out upon thee said the general what
can it avail thee to practise a profanity so horrible
to the ears others and which brings no
emolument to him who uses it 
there are doubtless more profitable sins in the
world than the vice swearing was the answer
which rose to the lips the cavalier but that was
exchanged for a profession regret for having
given offence the truth was the discourse began
to take a turn which rendered it more interesting
than ever to wildrake who therefore determined
not to lose the opportunity for obtaining posseswoodstock

sion the secret that seemed to be suspended
on cromwelps lips and that could only be
through means keeping guard upon his own
what sort a house is woodstock said
the general abruptly
an old mansion said wildrake in reply 
and so far as i could judge by a single night's
lodgings having abundance backstairs also
subterranean passages and all the communications
under ground which are common in old
ravennests the sort
and places for concealing priests unquestionably
said cromwell it is seldom that such
ancient houses lack secret stalls wherein to mew
up these calves bethel
your honour's excellency said wildrake
 may swear to that
 i swear not at all replied the general drily
 but what think'st thou good fellow i will
ask thee a blunt question where will those two
worcester fugitives that thou hottest be mcm'e
likely to take shelter and that they must be
sheltered somewhere i well know than in this
same old palace with all the corners and concealvol
i o
sio woodstock
ments whereof young albert hath been acquainted
ever since his earliest infancy 
truly said wildrake making an effort to
answer the question with seeming indifference
while the possibility such an event and its consequences
flashed fearfully upon his mind 
truly i should be your honour's opinion
but that i think the company who by the
commission parliament have occupied woodstock
are likely to fright them thence as a cat
scares doves from a pigeonhouse the neighbourhood
with reverence generals lesbos
and harrison will suit ill with fugitives
from worcesterfield
i thought as much and so indeed would i
have it answered the general long may it be
ere our names shall be aught but a terror to our
enemies but in this matter if thou art an active
plotter for thy master's interest thou might st i
should think work out something favourable to
his present object
my brain is too poor to reach the depth 
your honourable purpose said wildrake
 listen then and let it be to profit answered
cromwell assuredly the conquest at wore

chester was a great and crowning'mercy yet might
we seem to be but small in our thankfulness for
the same did we not do what in us lies towards
the ultimate improvement and final conclusion 
the great work which has been thus prosperous in
our hands professing in pure humility and singleness
 heart that we do not in any way desire
our instrumentality to be remembered nay
would rather pray and entreat that our name and
fortunes were forgotten than that the great work
were in itself incomplete nevertheless truly
placed as we now are it concerns us more nearly
than others that is if so poor creatures should
at all speak themselves as concerned whether
more or less with these changes which have been
wrought around not i say by ourselves or our
own power but by the destiny to which we were
called fulfilling the same with all meekness and
humility i say it concerns us nearly that all
things should be done in conformity with the
great work which hath been wrought and is yet
working in these lands such is my plain and
simple meaning nevertheless it is much to be
desired that this young man this king scots
 woodstock
as he called himself this charles stuart should
not escape forth from the nation where his arrival
has wrought so much disturbance and bloodshed

i have no doubt said the cavalier looking
down that your lordship's wisdom hath directed
all things as they may best lead towards such
a consummation and i pray your pains may be
paid as they deserve
 i thank thee friend said cromwell with
much humility doubtless we shall meet our
reward being in the hands a good paymaster
who never passeth saturday night but understand
me friend i desire no more than my own
share in the good work i would heartily do
what poor kindness i can to your worthy master
and even to you in your degree for such as i do
not converse with ordinary men that our presence
may be forgotten like an everyday's occurrence
we speak to men like thee for their reward or
their punishment and i trust it will be the former
which thou in thine office wilt merit at my
hand
woodstock 
your honour said wildrake speaks like
one accustomed to command
true men's minds are likened to those 
my degree by fear and reverence said the general
 but enough that desiring as i do no
other dependency on my special person than is
alike to us all upon that which is above us but
i would desire to cast this golden ball into your
master's cap he hath served against this charles
stuart and his father but he is a kinsman near
to the old knight lee and stands well affected
towards his daughter thou also wilt keep a
watch my friend that ruffling look thine will
procure thee the confidence every malignant
and the prey cannot approach this cover as
though to shelter like a coney in the rocks but
thou wilt be sensible his presence
i make a shift to comprehend your excellency
said the cavalier and i thank you
heartily for the good opinion you have put upon
me and which i pray i may have some handsome
opportunity deserving that i may show
my gratitude by the event but still with reverence
your excellency's scheme seems unlikely
while woodstock remains in possession the
 woodstock
sequestrated both the old knight and his son
and far more such a fugitive as your honour hinted
at will take special care not to approach it till
they are removed
it is for that i have been dealing with thee
thus long said the general i told thee that
i was something unwilling upon slight occasion
to dispossess the sequestrated by my own proper
warrant although having perhaps sufficient authority
in the state both to do so and to despise
the murmurs those who blame me in brief
i would be loath to tamper with my privileges
and make experiments between their strength
and the powers the commission granted by
others without need or at least great prospect 
advantage so if thy colonel will undertake for
his love the republic to find the means 
preventing its worst and nearest danger which
must needs occur from the escape this young
man and will do his endeavour to stay him incase
his flight should lead him to woodstock
which i hold very likely i will give thee an order
to these sequestrated to evacuate the palace
instantly and to the text troop my regiment
which lies at oxford to turn them out by the
woodstock 
shoulders if they make any scruples ay even
for example's sake if they drag desborough out
foremost though he be wedded to my sister
so please you sir said wildrake and
with your most powerful warrant i trust i might
expel the commissioners even without the aid
 your most warlike and devout troopers
that is what i am least anxious about replied
the general i should like to see the best
 them sit after i had nodded to them to begone
 always excepting the worshipful house
in whose name our commissions run but who as
some think will be done with politics ere it be
time to renew them therefore what chiefly
concerns me to know is whether thy master
will embrace a traffic which hath such a fair
promise profit with it i am well convinced
that with a scout like thee who hast been in the
cavaliers quarters and canst i should guess
resume thy drinking ruffianly healthquaffing
manners whenever thou hast a mind he must
discover where this stuart hath ensconced himself
either the young lee will visit the old
one in person or he will write to him or hold
 woodstock
communication with him by letter at all events
markham everard and thou must have an eye
in every hair your head while he spoke a
flush passed over his brow he rose from his chair
and paced the apartment in agitation woe
to you if you suffer the young adventurer to
escape me you had better be in the deepest
dungeon in europe than breathe the air england
should you but dream playing me false
i have spoken freely to thee fellow more freely
than is my wont the time required it but to
share my confidence is ike keeping a watch over
a powdermagazine the least and most insignificant
spark blows thee to ashes tell your master
what i said but not how i said it fie
that i should have been betrayed into the distemperature
 passion begone sirrah pearson
shall bring thee sealed orders yet stay
thou hast something to ask
i would know sid wildrake to whom
the visible anxiety the general gave some
confidence what is the figure this young
gallant in case i should find him 
a tall rawboned swarthy lad they say
woodstock 
he has shot up into here is his picture by a
good hand some time since he turned round
one the portraits which stood with its face
against the wall but it proved not to be that 
charles the second but his unhappy father
the first motion cromwell indicated a purpose
 hastily replacing the picture and it seemed
as if an effort was necessary to repress his disinclination
to look upon it but he did repress
it and placing the picture against the wall withdrew
slowly and sternly as if in defiance his
own feeling he was determined to gain a place
from which to see it to advantage it was well for
wildrake that his dangerous companion had not
turned an eye on him for his blood also kindled
when he saw the portrait his master in the
hands the chief author his death being a
fierce and desperate man he commanded his passion
with great difficulty and if on its first violence
he had been provided with a suitable weapon
it is possible cromwell would never have
ascended higher in his bold ascent towards supreme
power
but this natural and sudden flash indignant
woodstock
lion which rushed through the veins an ordinary
man like wildrake was presently subdued
when confronted with the strong yet stifled emotion
displayed by so powerful a character as
cromwell as the cavalier looked on his dark
and bold countenance agitated by inward and
indescribable feelings he found his own violence
 spirit die away and lose itself in fear and
wonder so true it is that as greater lights
swallow up and extinguish the display those
which are less so men great capacious and
overruling minds bear aside and subdue in
their climax passion the more feeble wills
and passions others as when a river joins a
brook the fiercer torrent shoulders aside the
smaller stream
wildrake stood a silent inactive and almost
a terrified spectator while cromwell assuming
a firm sternness eye and manner as one who
compels himself to look on what some strong internal
feeling renders painful and disgustful to
him proceeded in brief and interrupted expressions
but yet with a firm voice to comment on
the portrait the late king his words seemed
woodstock 
less addressed to wildrake than to be the spontaneous
unburthening his own bosom swelling
under recollection the past and anticipation
 the future
that flemish painter he said that antonio
vandyke what a power he has steel
may mutilate warriors may waste and destroy 
still the king stands uninjured by time and our
grandchildren while they read his history may
look on his image and compare the melancholy
features with the woful tale it was a stern necessity
 it was an awful deed the calm pride
 that eye might have ruled worlds crouching
frenchmen or supple italians or formal spaniards
but its glances only roused the native
courage the stern englishman slay not on
poor sinful man whose breath is in his nostrils
the blame that he falls when heaven never gave
him strength nerves to stand the weak rider
is thrown by his unruly horse and trampled to
death the strongest man the best cavalier
springs to the empty saddle and uses bit and
spur till the fiery horse knows its master who
blames him who mounted aloft rides triumphs
 woodstock
aptly amongst the people for having succeeded
where the unskilful and feeble fell and died
verily he hath his reward then what is that
piece painted canvass to me more than others 
no let him show to others the reproaches 
that cold calm face that proud yet complaining
eye those who have acted on higher respects
have no cause to start at painted shadows not
wealth nor power brought me from my obscurity
the oppressed consciences the injured
liberties england were the banner that i followed

he raised his voice so high as if pleading in
his own defence before some tribunal that pearson
the officer in attendance looked into the
apartment and observing his master with his
eyes kindling his arm extended his foot advanced
and his voice raised like a general in
the act commanding the advance his army
he instantly withdrew
it was other than selfish regards that drew
me forth to action continued cromwell and
i dare the world ay living or dead i challenge
to assert that i armed for a private cause or
woodstock 
as a means enlarging my fortunes neither
was there a trooper in the regiment who came
there with less evil will to yonder unhappy
 
at this moment the apartment opened and a
gentlewoman entered who from her resemblance
to the general although her features were soft
and feminine might be immediately recognised
as his daughter she walked up to cromwell
gently but firmly passed her arm through his
and said to him in a persuasive tone father
this is not well you have promised me this
should not happen
the general hung down his head like one
who was either ashamed the passion to which
he had given way or the influence which was
exercised over him he yielded however to
the affectionate impulse and left the apartment
without again turning his head towards the portrait
which had so much affected him
 woodstock
chapter 
doctorego to go to you have known what you should not
macbeth
wildrake was left in the cabinet astonished
and alone it was often noised about that cromwell
the deep and sagacious statesman the
calm and intrepid commander he who had overcome
such difficulties and ascended to such
heights that he seemed already to bestride the
land which he had conquered had like many
other men great genius a constitutional taint
 melancholy which sometimes displayed itself
both in words and actions and had been first
observed in that sudden and striking change
when abandoning entirely the dissolute freaks
 his youth he embraced a very strict course 
woodstock 
religious observances which upon some occasions
he seemed to consider as bringing him into
more near and close contact with the spiritual
world this extraordinary man is said sometimes
during that period his life to have
given way to spiritual delusions or as he himself
conceived them prophetic inspirations 
approaching grandeur and strange deep and
mysterious agencies in which he was in future to
be engaged in the same manner as his younger
years had been marked by fits exuberant and
excessive frolic and debaucheries something 
this kind seemed to explain the ebullitions 
passion which he had now manifested
with wonder at what he had witnessed wildrake
felt some anxiety on his own account though
not the most reflecting mortals he had sense
enough to know that it is dangerous to be a witness
 the infirmities men high in power and
he was left so long by himself as induced him to
entertain some secret doubts whether the general
might not be tempted to take means confining
or removing a witness who had seen him lowered
as it seemed by the suggestions his own
 woodstock
conscience beneath that lofty flight which in
general he affected to sustain above the rest 
the sublunary world
in this however he wronged cromwell who
was free either from an extreme degree jealous
suspicion or from anything which approached
towards bloodhastiness pearson appeared
after lapse about an hour and intimating to
wildrake that he was to follow conducted him
into a distant apartment in which he found the
general seated on a low couch his daughter
was in the apartment but remained at some distance
seemed busied with some female work and
scarce turned her head as pearson and wildrake
entered
at a sign from the lord general wildrake
approached him as before friend he said
your old friends the cavaliers look on me as
their enemy and conduct themselves towards meas
if they desired to make me such i profess
they are labouring to their own prejudice for i
regard and have ever regarded them as honest
and honourable fools who were silly enough to
run their necks into nooses and their heads
woodstock 
against stonewalls that a man called stuart and
no other should be king over them fools 
are there no words made letters that would
sound as well as charles stuart with that magic
title beside them why the word king is like
a lighted lamp that throws the same bright gilding
upon any combination the alphabet and
yet you must shed your blood for a name but
thou for thy part shalt have no wrong from me
here is an order well warranted to clear the
lodge at woodstock and abandon it to thy master's
keeping or those whom he shall appoint
he will have his uncle and pretty cousin with
him doubtless fare thee well think on what
i told thee they say beauty is a loadstone
to yonder long lad thou dost wot but i
reckon he has other stars at present to direct his
course than bright eyes and fair hair be it as
it may thou knowest my purpose peer out
peer out keep a constant and careful lookout
on every ragged patch that wanders by hedgerow
or lane these are days when a beggar's
cloak may cover a king's ransom there are
some broad portugal pieces for thee something

strange to thy pouch i ween once more think
on what thou hast heard and he added in a
lower and more impressive tone voice forget
what thou hast seen my service to thy master
 and yet once again rememberaxid jbr
get wildrake made his obeisance and returning
to his inn left windsor with all possible
speed
it was afternoon in the same day when the
cavalier rejoined his roundhead friend who was
anxiously expecting him at the inn in woodstock
appointed for their rendezvous
where hast thou been what hast thou
seen what strange uncertainty is in thy looks 
and why dost thou not answer me 
 because said wildrake laying aside his
riding cloak and rapier you ask so many
questions at once a man has but one tongue
to answer with and mine is well nigh glued to
the roof my mouth
will drink unloosen it said the colonel 
though i dare say thou hast tried that spell at
every alehouse on the road call for what thou
would'st have man only be quick
woodstock iati
 colonel everard answered wildrake i
have not tasted so much as a cup cold water
this day
then thou art out humour for that reason
said the colonel salve thy sore with
brandy if thou wilt but leave being so fantastic
and unlike to thyself as thou slowest in this
silent mood
colonel everard replied the cavalier very
gravely i am an altered man
i think thou dost alter every day in the
year and every hour the day come good
now tell me hast thou seen the general and got
his warrant for clearing out the sequestrated
from woodstock
i have seen the devil said wildrake and
hast as thou sayst got a warrant from him
give it me hastily said everard catching
at the packet
forgive me mark said wildrake if
thou knowest the purpose with which this deed
is granted if thou knowest what is not my
purpose to tell thee what manner hopes are
founded on thy accepting it i have that opinion
 woodstock
 thee mark everard that thou would'st as soon
take a redhot horse shoe from the anvil with thy
bare hand as receive into it this slip paper
come comes said everard this comes 
some your exalted ideas loyalty which
excellent within certain bounds drive us mad
when encouraged up to some heights do not
think since i must needs speak plainly with thee
that i see without sorrow the downfall our
ancient monarchy and the substitution another
form government in its stead but
ought my regret for the past to prevent my acquiescing
and aiding in such measures as are
likely to settle the future the royal cause is
ruined hadst thou and every cavalier in england
sworn the contrary ruined not to rise again
for many a day at least the parliament so
often draughted and drained those who were
courageous enough to maintain their own freedom
 opinion is now reduced to a handful 
statesmen who have lost the respect the people
from the length time during which they
have held the supreme management affairs
they cannot stand long unless they were to
woodstock j
reduce the army and the army late servants
are now masters and will refuse to be reduced
they know their strength and that they maybe
an army subsisting on pay and free quarters
throughout england as long as they will i tell
thee wildrake unless we look to the only man
who can rule and manage them we may expect
military law throughout the land and i for
mine own part look for any preservation our
privileges that may be vouchsafed to us only
through the wisdom and forbearance cromwell
now you have my secret you are aware
that i am not doing the best i would but the
best i can i wish not so ardently as thou
perhaps yet i do wish that the king could have
been restored on good terms composition safe
for us and for himself and now good wildrake
rebel as thou thickest me make me no
worse a rebel than an unwilling one god knows
i never laid aside love and reverence to the king
even in drawing my sword against his ill advisers

ah plague on you said wildrake that
is the very cant itthat's what yoh all say
 woodstock
all you fought against the king in pure love
and loyalty and not otherwise however i see
your drift and i own that i like it better than
i expected the army is your bear now and
old noll is your bear ward and you are like a
country constable who makes interest with the
bernard that he may prevent him from letting
bruin loose well there may come a day when
the sun will shine on our side the fence and
thereon shall you and all the good fairweather
folks who love the stronger party come and
make common cause with us
without much attending to what his friend
said colonel everard carefully studied the warrant
 cromwell it is bolder and more peremptory
than i expected he said the general
must feel himself strong when he opposes
his own authority so directly to that the council
 state and the parliament
 you will not hesitate to act upon it said
wildrake
 that i certainly will not answered everard
 but i must wait till i have the assistance
 the mayor who i think will gladly see these
woodstock si
fellows ejected from the lodge i must not go
altogether upon military authority if possible
then stepping to the door the apartment he
dispatched a servant the house in quest the
chief magistrate desiring he should be made
acquainted that colonel everard desired to see
bim with as little loss time as possible
you are sure he will come like a dog at a
whistle said wildrake the word captain
or colonel makes the fat citizen trot in these
days when one sword is worth fifty corporation
charters but there are dragoons yonder as
well as the grimfaced knave whom i frightened
the other evening when i showed my face in at
the window think'st thou the knaves will show
no rough play 
 the general's warrant will weigh more with
them than a dozen acts parliament said everard
 but it is time thou latest if thou hast
in truth ridden from windsor hither without
baiting
i care not about it said wildrake i
hell thee your general gave me a breakfast
svhich i think will serve me one while if i ever
 woodstock
am able to digest it by the mass it lay so heavy
on my conscience that i carried it to church to
see if i could digest it there with my other sins
but not a avait
to church to the door the church
thou meanest said everard i know thy way
thou art ever wont to pull thy hat off reverently
at the threshold but for crossing it that
day seldom comes
well replied wildrake and if i do pull
off my castor and kneel is it not seemly to show
the same respects in a church which we offer
in a palace it is a dainty matter is it not
to see your anabaptists and brownish and the
rest you gather to a sermon with as little
ceremony as hogs to a trough but here comes
food and now for a grace if i can remember
one
everard was too much interested about the
fate his uncle and his fair cousin and the prospect
 restoring them to their quiet home under
the protection that formidable truncheon which
was already regarded as the leadingstaff england
to remark that certainly a great alteration
woodstock 
had taken place in the manners and outward
behaviour at least his companion his demeanour
frequently evinced a sort struggle
betwixt old habits indulgence and some newly
formed resolutions abstinence and it was
almost ludicrous to see how often the hand 
the neophyte directed itself naturally to a large
black leathern jack which contained two double
flagons strong ale and how often diverted
from its purpose by the better reflections the
reformed toper it seized instead upon a lai'gc
ewer salubrious and pure water 
it was easy to see that the task sobriety
was not yet become easy and that if it had the
recommendation the intellectual portion 
the party who had resolved upon it the outward
man yielded a reluctant and restive compliance
but honest wildrake had been dreadfully frightened
at the course proposed to him by cromwell
and with a feeling not peculiar to the catholic
religion had formed a solemn resolution
within his own mind that if he came off safe and
with honour from this dangerous interview he
would show his sense heavens favour by
s woodstock
renouncing some the sins which most easily
beset him and especially that intemperance
to which like many his wild compeers he was
too much addicted
this resolution or vow was partly prudential
as well as religious for it occurred to him as
very possible that some matters a difficult and
delicate nature might be thrown into his hands
at the present emergency during the conduct
 which it would be fitting for him to act by
some better oracle than that the bottle celebrated
by rabelais in full compliance with this
prudent determination he touched neither the
ale nor the brandy which was placed before him
and declined peremptorily the sack with which
his friend would have garnished the board nevertheless
just as the boy removed the trenchers
and napkins together with the large black jack
which we have already mentioned and was one
or two steps on his way to the door the sinewy
arm the cavalier which seemed to elongate
itself on purpose as it extended far beyond the
folds the threadbare jacket arrested the progress
 the retiring ganymede and seizing on
woodstock 
the black jack conveyed it to the lips which were
gently breathing forth the aspiration d n
i mean heaven forgive me ewe are poor
creatures clay one modest sip must be permitted
to our frailty
so murmuring he glued the huge flagon to
his lips and as the head was slowly and gradually
inclined backwards in proportion as the
right hand elevated the bottom the pitcher
everard had great doubts whether the drinker
and the cup were likely to part until the whole
contents the latter had been transferred to the
person the former roger wildrake stinted
however when by a moderate computation he
had swallowed at one draught about a quart and
a half
he then replaced it on the salver fetched a
long breath to refresh his lungs bade the boy
get him gone with the rest the liquors in a
tone which inferred some dread his constancy
and then turning to his friend everard he expatiated
in praise moderation observing that
the mouthful which he had just taken had been
 more service to him than if he had remained
sc woodstock
quaffing healths at table for four hours together

his friend made no reply but could not help
being privately opinion that wildrakes temperance
had done as much execution on the tankard
in his single draught as some more moderate
topers might have effected if they had sat
sipping for an evening but the subject was
changed by the entrance the landlord who
came to announce to his honour colonel everard
that the worshipful mayor woodstock
with the rev master holdenough were come
to wait upon him
woodstock s
chapter x
 here have we one head
upon two bodies your twoheaded bullock
is but an ass to such a prodigy
these two have but one meaning thought and counsel 
and when the single noddle has spoke out
the four legs scrape assent to it
old play
in the goodly form the honest mayor there
was a bustling mixture importance and embarrassment
like the deportment a man who was
conscious that he had an important part to act
if he could but exactly discover what that part
was but both were mingled with much pleasure
at seeing everard and he frequently repeated
his welcomes and allhails before he could be
brought to attend to what that gentleman said in
reply
good worthy colonel you are indeed a desirable
sight to woodstock at all times being as
i may say almost our townsman as you have
 woodstock
tlwelt so much and so long at the palace truly
the matter begins almost to pass my wit though
i have transacted the affairs this borough for
many a long day and you are come to my assistance
like like
tanquam deus ex machina as the ethnic
poet hath it said master holdenough although
i do not often quote from such books
master markham everard or worthy
colonel as i ought rather to say you are simply
the most welcome man who has come to
woodstock since the days old king harry
 i had some business with you my good
friend said the colonel addressing the mayor
i shall be glad if it should so happen at the
same time that i may find occasion to pleasure
you or your worthy pastor
 no question you can do so good sir interposed
master holdenough you have the heart
sir and you have the hand and we are much in
want good counsel and that from a man action
i am aware worthy colonel that you and
your worthy father have ever borne yourselves
in these turmoils like men a truly christian
and moderate spirit striving to pour oil into the
woodstock 
wounds the land which some would rub with
vitriol and pepper and we know you are faithful
children the church we have reformed
from its papistical and prelatical tenets
 my good and reverend friend said everard
 i respect the piety and learning many
 your teachers but i am also for liberty 
conscience to all men i neither side with sectaries
nor do i desire to see them the object 
suppression by violence
 sir sir said the presbyterian hastily all
this hath a fair sound but i would you should
think what a fine country and church we are like
to have it amidst the errors blasphemies and
schisms which are daily introduced into the
church and kingdom england so that worthy
master edwards in his gangrene declared that
our native country is about to become the very
sink and cesspool all schisms heresies blasphemies
and confusions as the army hannibal
was said to be the refuse au naiionscouuvies
omnium gentium believe me worthy colonel
that they the honourable house view all this
over lightly and with the winking connivance 
 woodstock
old eli these instructors the schismatics shoulder
the orthodox ministers out their pulpits
thrust themselves into families and break up the
peace thereof stealing away men's hearts from
the established faith
 my good master holdenough replied the
colonel interrupting the zealous preacher there
is ground sorrow for all these unhappy discords
 and i hold with you that the fiery spirits
 the present time have raised men's minds at
once above soberminded and sincere religion
and above decorum and common sense but
there is no help save patience enthusiasm is a
stream that may foam off in its own time whereas
it is sure to bear down every barrier which is
directly opposed to it but what are these schismatical
proceedings to our present purpose 
why partly this sir said holdenough
although perhaps you may make less it than
i should have thought before we met i was
myself i nehemiah holdenough he added
consequentially was forcibly expelled from my
own pulpit even as a man should have been
thrust out his own house by an alien and
 
woodstock 
an intruder a wolf who was not at the trouble
even to put on sheep's clothing but came in
his native wolfish attire buff and bandalier
and held forth in my stead to the people who
are to me as a flock to the lawful shepherd it
is too true sir master mayor saw it and strove
to take such order to prevent it as man might
though turning to the mayor i think still you
might have striven a little more
good now good master holdenough do not
let us go back on that question said the mayor
guy warwick or bevis hampton might
do something with this generation but truly
they are too many and too strong for the mayor
 woodstock
i think master mayor speaks very good
sense said the colonel if the independents
are not allowed to preach i fear me they will not
fight and then if you were to have another rising
 cavaliers 
there are worse folks may rise than cavaliers
said holdenough
how sir replied colonel everard let
vol i q
 woodstock
me remind you master holdenough that is no
safe language in the present state the nation
i say said the presbyterian there are
worse folks may rise than cavaliers and i will
prove what i say the devil is worse than the
worst cavalier that ever drunk a health or swore
an oath and the devil has arisen at woodstock
lodge 
ay truly hath he said the mayor bodily
and visibly in figure and form an awful
time we live in 
 gentlemen i really know not how i am to
understand you said everard
why it was even about the devil we came
to speak with you said the mayor but the
worthy minister is always so hot upon the sectaries

which are the devil's brats and nearly akin
to him said master holdenough but true it
is that the growth these sects has brought up
the evil one even upon the face the earth to
look after his own interest where he finds it most
thriving
master holdenough said the colonel if
woodstock 
you speak figuratively i have already told you
that i have neither the means nor the skill sufficient
to temper these religious heats but if you
design to say that there has been an actual apparition
 the devil i presume to think that you
with your doctrine and your learning would bea
fitter match for him than a soldier like me
true sir and i have that confidence in the
commission which i hold that i would take the
field against the foul fiend without a moment's
delay said holdenough but the place in
which he hath late appeared being woodstock
is filled with those dangerous and impious
persons whom i have been but now complaining
 and though i dare venture in disputation
with their great master himself yet without your
protection most worthy colonel i see not that
i may with prudence trust myself with the tossing
and goring ox desborough or the bloody
and devouring bear harrison or the cold and
poisonous snake bletson all whom are now
at the lodge doing license and taking spoil as
they think meet and as all men say the devil
has come to make a fourth with them
s woodstock
in good truth worthy and noble sir said
the mayor it is even as master holdenough
says our privileges are declared void our cattle
seized in the very pastures they talk cutting
down and dispersing the fair chase which has
been so long the pleasure so many kings and
making woodstock as little note as any paltry
village i assure you we heard your arrival
with joy and wondered at your keeping yourself
o close in your lodgings we know no one save
your father or you that are like to stand the
poor burgesses friend in this extremity since almost
all the gentry around are malignant and
under sequestration we trust therefore you
will make strong intercession in our behalf
 certainly master mayor said the colonel
who saw himself with pleasure anticipated it
was my very purpose to have interfered in this
matter and i did but keep myself alone until
i should be furnished with some authority from
the lord general
 powers from the lord general said the
mayor thrusting the clergyman with his elbow
 dost thou hear that what cock will fight
woodstock 
that cock we shall carry it now over their
neekfi and woodstock shall be brave woodstock
still 
 keep thine elbow from my side friends
said holdenough annoyed by the action which
the mayor had suited to his words and may
the lord send that cromwell prove not as sharp
to the people england as thy bones against
my person yet i approve that we should use
his authority to stop the course these men's
proceedings
let us set out then said colonel everard 
 and i trust we shall find the gentlemen reasonable
and obedient
the functionaries laic and clerical assented
with much joy and the colonel required and
received wildrake's assistance in putting on his
cloak and rapier as if he had been the dependant
whose part he acted the cavalier contrived
however while doing him these menial offices to
give his friend a shrewd pinch in order to maintain
the footing secret equality betwixt them
the colonel was saluted as they passed through
the streets by many the anxious inhabitants
j woodstock
who seemed to consider his intervention as affording
the only chance saving their fine park and
the rights the corporation as well as individuals
from ruin and confiscation
as they entered the park the colonel asked
his companions what is this you say apparitions
being seen amongst them 
 why colonel said the clergyman you
know yourself that woodstock was always haunted

i have lived therein many a day said the
colonel and i know that i never saw the
least sign it although idle people spoke the
house as they do all old mansions and gave
the apartments ghosts and spectres to fill up the
places the deceased great who had ever dwelt
there
nay but good colonel said the clergyman
i trust you have not reached the prevailing sin
 the times and become indifferent to the testimony
in favour apparitions which appears so
conclusive to all but atheists and advocates for
witches 
 i would not absolutely disbelieve what is so
woodstock 
generally affirmed said the colonel but my
temper leads me to doubt most the stories
which i have heard this sort and my own experience
never went to confirm any them
ay but trust me said holdenough there
was always a demon one or the other species
about this woodstock not a man or woman in
the town but has heard stories apparitions in
the forest or about the old castle sometimes it
is a pack hounds that sweep along and the
whoops and hollow the huntsman and the
winding horns and the galloping horse
which is heard as if first more distant and then
close around you and then anon it is a solitary
huntsman who asks if you can tell him which
way the stag has gone he is always dressed in
green but the fashion his clothes is some five
hundred years old this is what we call demon
meridian the noonday spectre
my worthy and reverend sir said the colonel
 i have lived at woodstock many seasons
and have traversed the chase at all hours trust
me what you hear from the villagers is the growth
 their idle folly and superstition
colonel replied holdenough a negative
 woodstock
proves nothing what signifies craving your
pardon that you have not seen anything be it
earthly or be it the other world to detract from
the evidence a score people who have 
and besides there is the demon nocturnal 
the being that walketh by night he has been
among these independents and schismatics last
night ay colonel you may stare but it is
even so they may try whether he will mend
their gifts as they profanely call them exposition
and prayer no sir i trow to master the
foul fiend there goeth some competent knowledge
 theology and an acquaintance with the humane
letters ay and a regular clerical education
and clerical calling
i do not in the least doubt said the colonel
 the efficacy your qualifications to lay the
devil but still i think some odd mistake has occasioned
this confusion amongst them if there
has any such in reality existed desborough is a
blockhead to be sure and harrison is fanatic
enough to believe anything but there is bletson
on the other hand who believes nothing 
what do you know this matter good master
mayor r
woodstock 
 in sooth and it was master bletson who gave
the first alarm replied the magistrate or at
least the first distinct one you see sir i was
in bed with my wife and no one else and i was
as fast asleep as a man can desire to be at two
hours after midnight when behold you they came
knocking at my bedroom door to tell me there
was an alarm in woodstock and that the bell 
the lodge was ringing at that dead hour the
night as hard as ever it rung when it called the
court to dinner
 well but the cause this alarm said the
colonel
 you shall hear worthy colonel you shall
hear answered the mayor waving his hand
with dignity for he was one those persons
who will not be hurried out their own pace
so mrs mayor would have persuaded me in
her love and affection poor wretch that to rise
at such an hour out my warm bed was like
to bring on my old complaint the lumbago and
that i should send the people to alderman button
 alderman devil mrs mayor said i 
i beg your reverence's pardon for using such a
 woodstock
phrase do you think i am going to lie abed
when the town is on fire and the cavaliers up
and the devil to pay i beg pardon again parson
but here we are before the gate the
palace will it not please you to enter 
i would first hear the your story
said the colonel that is master mayor if it
happens to have an 
 everything hath an said the mayor
 and that which we call a pudding hath two
your worship will forgive me for being facetious
where was i o i jumped out bed and
put on my red plush breeches with the blue nether
stocks for i always make a point being
dressed suitably to my dignity night and day
summer or winter colonel everard and i took
the constable along with me in case the alarm
should be raised by nightwalkers or thieves and
called up worthy master holdenough out his
bed in case it should turn out to be the devil
and so i thought i was provided for the worst
and so away we came and by and by the soldiers
who came to the town with master tompkins
who had been called to arms came marching
woodstock 
down to woodstock as fast as their feet would
carry them so i gave our people the sign to let
them pass us and outmarch us as it were and
this for a twofold reason
i will be satisfied interrupted the colonel
with one good reason you desired the redcoats
should have ther the fray
true sir very true and also that they
should have the last it in respect that fighting
is their especial business however we came on
at a slow pace as men who are determined to do
their duty without fear or favour when suddenly
we saw something white haste away up the
avenue towards the town when six our constables
and assistants fled at once as conceiving
it to be an apparition called the white woman
 woodstock
look you there colonel said master holdenough
 i told you there were demons more
kinds than one which haunt the ancient scenes 
royal debauchery and cruelty
 i hope you stood your own ground master
mayor said the colonel
i yes most assuredly that is i did not

sss woodstock
strictly speaking keep my ground but the townclerk
and i retreated retreated colonel and
without confusion or dishonour and took post behind
worthy master holdenough who with the
spirit a lion threw himself in the way the
supposed spectre and attacked it with such a
literary latin as might have scared the devil
himself and thereby plainly discovered that it
was no devil at all nor white woman neither
woman any colour but worshipful master breton
a member the house commons and
one the commissioners sent hither upon this
unhappy sequestration the wood chase and
lodge woodstock
and this was all you saw the demon 
said the colonel
truly yes answered the mayor and i
had no wish to see more however we conveyed
master bletson as in duty bound back to the
lodge and he was ever maundering by the way
how that he met a party scarlet devils incarnate
marching down to the lodge but to my poor
thinking it must have been the independent dragoons
who had just passed us
woodstock 
and more incarnate devils i would never
wish to see said wildrake who cour remain
silent no longer his voice so suddenly heard
showed how much the mayor's nerves were still
alarmed for he started and jumped aside with an
alacrity which no one would at first sight suppose
a man his portly dignity to have been
capable everard imposed silence on his intrusive
attendant and desirous to hear the conclusion
 this strange story requested the mayor
to tell him how the matter ended and whether
they stopped the supposed spectre
 truly worthy sir said the mayor master
holdenough was quite venturous upon confronting
as it were the devil and compelling
him to appear under the real form master
joshua bletson member parliament for the
borough littlefaith
in sooth master mayor said the divine i
were strangely ignorant my own commission
and its immunities if i were to value opposing
myself to satan or any independent in his likeness
all whom in the name him i serve
i do defy spit at and trample under my feet 
 woodstock
and because master mayor is something tedious
i will briefly inform your honour that we saw
little the enemy that night save what master
bletson said in the first feeling his terrors and
save what we might collect from the disordered
appearance the honourable colonel desborough
and majorgeneral harrison
and what plight were they in i pray you 
demanded the colonel 
why worthy sir every one might see with
half an eye that they had been engaged in a fight
wherein they had not been honoured with victory
seeing that general harrison was stalking
up and down the parlour with his drawn sword
in his hand talking to himself his doublet unbuttoned
his points untrussed his garters loose
and like to throw him down as he now and then
trod on them and gaping and grinning like a
mad player and yonder sate desborough with
a dry pottle sack before him which he had just
emptied and which though the element in which
he trusted had not restored him sense enough to
speak or courage enough to look over his shoulder
he had a bible in his hand forsooth as if it
woodstock 
would make battle against the evil one but i
peered over his shoulder and alas the good
gentleman held the bottom the page uppermost
it was as if one your musketeers noble
and valued sir were to present the butt 
his piece at the enemy instead the muzzle
ha ha ha it was a sight to judge schismatics
by both in point head and in point hearty
in point skill and in point courage oh 
colonel then was the time to see the true character
 an authorized pastor souls over those
unhappy men who leap into the fold without due
and legal authority and will forsooth preach
teach and exhort and blasphemously term the
doctrine the church saltless porridge and dry
chips
i have no doubt you were ready to meet the
danger reverend sir but i would fain know 
what nature it was and from whence it was to be
apprehended 
was it for me to make such inquiry said
the clergyman triumphantly is it for a brave
soldier to number his enemies or inquire from
what quarter they are to come no sir i was
u
i woodstock
there with match lighted bullet in my mouth
and my marquess shouldered to encounter as
many devils as hell could pour in were they
countless as motes in the sunbeam and came
from all points the compass the papists talk
 the temptation st anthony pshaw let
them double all the myriads which the brain a
crazy dutch painter hath invented and you will
find a poor presbyterian divine i will answer
for one at least who not in his own strength
but his masters will receive the assault in such
sort that far from returning against him as against
yonder poor hound day after day and night after
night he will at once pack them off as with
a vengeance to the uttermost parts assyria
still said the colonel i pray to know
whether you saw anything upon which to exercise
your pious learning 
saw answered the divine no truly i
saw nothing nor did i look for anything thieves
will not attack wellarmed travellers nor will devils
or evil spirits come against one who bears in
his bosom the word truth in the very language
in which it was first dictated no sir they shun
woodstock
a divine who can understand the holy text as a
crow is said to keep wide a gun loaded with
hailshot
they had walked a little way back upon their
road to give time for this conversation and the
colonel perceiving it was about to lead to no satisfactory
explanation the real cause alarm
on the preceding night turned round and observing
it was time they should go to the lodge
began to move in that direction with his three
companions
it was now becoming dark and the towers 
woodstock arose high above the umbrageous
shroud which the forest spread around the ancient
and venerable mansion from one the
highest turrets which could still be distinguished
as it rose against the clear blue sky there gleamed
a light like that a candle within the building
the mayor stopt short and catching fast
hold the divine and then colonel everard
exclaimed in a trembling and hasty but suppressed
tone do you see yonder light 
ray marry do i said colonel everard
sand what does that matter a light in a garvol
i r
sf woodstock
retroom such an old mansion as woodstock
is no subject for wonder i trow
but a light from rosamond's tower is surely
so said the mayor
true said the colonel something surprised
when after a careful examination he satisfied
himself that the worthy magistrate's conjecture
was real that is indeed rosamond's
tower and as the drawbridge by which it was
accessible has been destroyed for centuries it is
hard to say what chance could have lighted a
lamp in such an inaccessible place
that light burns with no earthly fuel said
the mayor neither from whale nor olive nor
beeswax nor muttonsuet either i dealt in
these commodities colonel before i went into
my present line and i can assure you i could
distinguish the sort light they give one from
another at a greater distance than yonder turret
look you that is no earthly flame see you
not something blue and reddish upon the edges 
that bodes full well where it comes from 
colonel in my opinion we had better go back to
sup at the town and leave the devil and the
woodstock 
redcoats to settle their matters together for tonight
and then when we come back the next
morning we will have a pull with the party that
chances to keep afield
you will do as you please master mayor
said everard but my duty requires me that i
should see the commissioners to night
and mine requires me to see the foul fiend
said master holdenough if he dare make himself
visible to me i wonder not that knowing
is approaching he betakes himself to the very
citadel the inner and the last defences this
ancient and haunted mansion he is dainty i
warrant you and must dwell where is a relish 
luxury and murder about the walls his chamber
in yonder turret sinned rosamond and
in yonder turret she suffered and there she sits
or more likely the enemy in her shape as i
have heard true men woodstock tell i wait
on you good colonel master mayor will do ashe
pleases the strong man hath fortified himself
in his dwellinghouse but lo there comes
another stronger than he
for me said the mayor who am as unwoodstock

learned as i am un warlike i will not engage either
with the powers the earth or the prince 
the powers the air and i will go back to
woodstock and hark ye good fellow slapping
wildrake on the shoulder i will bestow
on thee a shilling wet and a shilling dry if thou
wilt go with me
gadzojkers master mayor said wildrake
neither flattered by the magistrate's familiarity
 address nor captivated by his munificence
 i wonder who the devil made you
and nee fellows and besides do you think i
would go back to woodstock with your worshipful
codeshead when by good management i
may get a peep fair rosamond and see whether
she was that choice and incomparable piece 
ware which the world has been told by rhymers
and balladmakers 
speak less lightly and wantonly friend
said the divine we are to resist the devil that
he may flee from us and not to tamper with
him or enter into his counsels or traffic with the
merchandize his great vanity fair
mind what the good man says wildrake

woodstock 
said the colonel and take heed another time
how thou dost suffer thy wk to outrun discretion

i am beholden to the reverend gentleman
for his advice answered wildrake upon whose
tongue it was difficult to impose any curb whatever
even when his own safety rendered it most
desirable but gadzookers let him have had
what experience he will in fighting with the devil
he never saw one so black as i had a tussle
with not a hundred years ago
how friend said the clergyman who understood
everything literally when apparitions
were mentioned have you had so late a visitation
 satan believe me then that i wonder
why thou dearest to entertain his name so
often and so lightly as i see thou dost use it in
thy ordinary discourse but when and where
didst thou see the evil one 
everard hastily interposed lest by something
yet more strongly alluding to cromwell his imprudent
squire should in mere wantonness betray
his interview with the general the
young man raves he said a dream which
 woodstock
he had the other night when he and i slept together
in victor lee's chamber belonging to the
ranger's apartments at the lodges
thanks for help at a pinch good patron
said wildrake whispering into everard's ear
who in vain endeavoured to shake him off a
fib never failed a fanatic
you also spoke something too lightly 
these matters considering the work which we
have in hand worthy colonel said the presbyterian
divine believe me the young man
thy servant was more like to see visions than to
dream merely idle dreams in that apartment 
for i have always heard that next to rosamond's
tower in which as i said she played
the wanton and was after ward's poisoned by
queen eleanor victor lee's chamber was the
place in the lodge woodstock more peculiarly
the haunt evil spirits i pray you young
man tell me this dream or vision yours
with all my heart sir said wildrake
then addressing his patron who began to interferes
he said tush sir you have had the discourse
for an hour send why should not i hold
woodstock 
forth in my turn by this darkness if you keep
me silent any longer i will turn independent
preacher and stand up in your despite for the
freedom private judgment and so reverend
sir i was dreaming a carnal advertisement called
a bullbaiting and methought there were
venturing dogs at head as merrily as e'er i saw
them at tutburybullrunning and methought
i heard some one say there was the devil come to
have a sight the bullring well i thought that
gad swoons i would have a peep at his infernal
majesty so i looked and there was a butcher in
greasy woollen with his steel by his side but he
was none the devil and there was a drunken
cavalier with his mouth full oaths and his
stomach full emptiness and a goldlaced waistcoat
in a very dilapidated condition and a ragged
hat with a piece a feather in it and he
was none the devil neither and here was a
miller his hands dusty with meal and every
atom it stolen and there was a vintner his
green apron stained with wine and every drop
 it sophisticated but neither was the old gentleman
i looked for to be detected among those

artizans iniquity at length sir i saw r
grave person with cropped hair a pair longish
and projecting ears a band as broad as a slobbering
bib under his chin a brown coat surmounted
by a geneva cloak and i had old
nicholas at once in his genuine paraphernalia
by 
 shame shame said colonel everard
what behave thus to an old gentleman and a
divine 
nay let him proceed said the minister with
perfect equanimity if thy friend or secretary
is gibing i must have less patience than becomes
my profession if i could not bear an idle
jest and forgive him who makes it or if on
the other hand the enemy has really presented
himself to the young man in such a guise ashe
intimates wherefore should we be surprised
that he who can take upon him the form an
angel light should be able to assume that 
a frail and peccable mortal whose spiritual calling
and profession ought indeed to induce him
to make his life an example to others but whose
conduct nevertheless such is the imperfection 
woodstock scour
unassisted nature sometimes rather presents
us with a warning what we should shun 
now by the mass honest dominie i mean
reverend sir i crave you a thousand pardons
said wildrake penetrated by the quietness and
patience the presbyter's rebuke by st
george if quiet patience will do it thou art fit
to play a game at foils with the devil himself
and i would be contented to hold stakes
as he concluded an apology which was certainly
not uncalled for and seemed to be received
in perfectly good part they approached so
close to the exterior door the lodge that they
were challenged with the emphatic stand by a
sentinel who mounted guard there colonel
everard replied a friend and the sentinel repeating
his command stand friend proceeded
to call the corporal the guard the corporal
came forth and at the same time turned
out his guard colonel everard gave his name
and designation as well as those his companions
on which the corporal said he doubted
not there would be orders for his instant admission
but in the first place mr tomkins
 woodstock
must be consulted that he might learn their
honours mind
 how sir said the colonel do you
knowing who i am presume to keep me on the
outside your post 
not if your honour pleases to enter said
the corporal and undertakes to be my warranty
 but such are the orders my post
nay then do your duty said the colonel 
but are the cavaliers up or what is the matter
that you keep so close and strict a watch 
the fellow gave no distinct answer but muttered
between his moustaches something about
the enemy and the roaring lion who goeth
about seeking what he may devour presently
afterwards tomkins appeared followed by two
servants bearing lights in great standing brass
candlesticks they marched before colonel everard
and his party keeping as close to each other
as two cloves the same orange and starting
from time to time and shouldering as they passed
through sundry intricate passages they led
up a large and ample wooden staircase the banisters
rail and lining which were executed
woodstock 
in black oak and finally into a long saloon or
parlour where there was a prodigious fire and
about twelve candles the largest size distributed
in sconces against the wall there were seated
the commissioners who now held in their power
the ancient mansion and royal domain woodstock

chapter xl
the bloody bear an independent beast
unlocked to forms in groans he had express'd
next him the bassoon ape as atheists use
mimick'd all sects and had his own to choose
hind and panther
the strong light in the parlour which we have
described served to enable everard easily to recognise
his acquaintances desborough harrison
and bletson who had assembled themselves round
an oak table large dimensions placed near the
blazing chimney on which were arranged wine
and ale and materials for smoking then the general
indulgence the time there was a species
 movable cupboard set betwixt the table and
the door calculated originally for a display 
plate upon grand occasions but at present only
used as a screen which purpose it served so effect
actually
that ere he had coasted around it everard
heard the following fragment what desborough
was saying in his coarse strong voice 
sent him to share with us fse warrant ye it
was always his excellency my brotherinlaw's
way if he made a treat for five friends he would
invite more than the table could hold i have
known him ask three men to eat two eggs
hush hush said bletson and the servants
making their appearance from behind the tall cupboard
announced colonel everard it may not
be unpleasing to the reader to have a description
 the party into which he now entered
desborough was a stout bullnecked man 
middle size with heavy vulgar features grizzled
bushy eyebrows and walleyes the flourish
 his powerful relative's fortunes had burst
forth in the finery his dress which was much
more ornamented than was usual among the roundheads
there was embroidery on his cloak and
lace upon his band his hat displayed a feather
with a golden clasp and all his habiliments were
those a cavalier or follower the court rather
than the plain dress a parliamentarian officer
s woodstock
but heaven knows there was little courtlike
grace or dignity in the person or demeanour 
the individual who became his fine suit as the
hog on the signpost does his gilded armour it
was not that he was positively deformed or misshaped
for taken in detail the figure was well
enough but his limbs seemed to act upon different
and contradictory principles they were
not as the play says in a concatenation accordingly
 the right hand moved as if it were upon
bad terms with the left and the legs showed an inclination
to foot it in different and opposite directions
in short to use an extravagant comparison
the members colonel desborough seemed
rather to resemble the disputatious representatives
 a federative congress than the wellordered
union the orders the state in a firm and
wellcompacted monarchy where each holds his
own place and all obey the dictates a common
head
general harrison the second the commissioners
was a tall thin middleaged man who
had risen into his high situation in the army
and his intimacy with cromwell by his dauntless
woodstock 
courage in the field and the popularity he had
acquired by his exalted enthusiasm amongst the
military saints sectaries and independents who
composed the strength the existing army harrison
was mean extraction and bred up to his
father's employment a butcher nevertheless
his appearance though coarse was not vulgar like
that desborough who had so much the advantage
 him in birth and education he had
as we have said a masculine height and strength
 figure was well made and in his manner announced
a rough military character which might
be feared but could not be the object contempt
or ridicule his aquiline nose and dark black
eyes set off to some advantage a countenance
otherwise irregular and the wild enthusiasm that
sometimes sparkled in them as he dilated on his
opinions to others and often seemed to slumber
under his long dark eyelashes as he mused upon
them himself gave something strikingly wild and
even noble to his aspect he was one the chief
leaders those who were called fifthmonarchy
men who going even beyond the usual fanaticism
 the age presumptuously interpreted the
s woodstock
 the revelations after their own fancies
considered that the second advent the messiah
and the millennium or reign the saints
upon earth was close at hand and that they
themselves illuminated as they believed with the
power foreseeing these approaching events were
the choice instruments for the establishment the
new reign or fifth monarchy as it was called
and were fated also to win its honours whether
celestial or terrestrial
when this spirit enthusiasm which operated
like a partial insanity was not immediately
affecting harrison's mind he was a shrewd worldly
man and a good soldier one who missed no
opportunity mending his fortune and who in
expecting the exaltation the fifth monarchy
was in the meanwhile a ready instrument for the
establishment the lord generals supremacy
whether it was owing to his early occupation
and habits indifference to pain or bloodshed
to natural disposition and want feeling or
finally to the awakened character his enthusiasm
which made him look upon those who opposed
him as opposing the divine will and therefore
woodstock 
meriting no favour or mercy is not easy to say
but all agreed that after a victory or the successful
storm a town harrison was one the
most cruel and pitiless men in cromwelps army 
always urging some misapplied text to authorize
the continued execution the fugitives and sometimes
even putting to death those who had surrendered
themselves prisoners it was said that at
times the recollection some those cruelties
troubled his conscience and disturbed the dreams
 beatification in which his imagination indulged
when everard entered the apartment this
true representative the fanatical soldiers the
day who filled those ranks and regiments which
cromwell had politically kept on foot while he
procured the reduction those in which the presbyterian
interest predominated was seated a little
apart from the others his legs crossed and stretched
out at length towards the fire his head resting
on his elbow and turned upwards as if studying
with the most profound gravity the halfseen
carving the gothic roof
bletson remains to be mentioned who in person
and figure was diametrically different from
vol i i
 woodstock
the other two there was neither foppery nor
slovenliness in his exterior nor had he any
marks military service or rank about his person
a small walking rapier seemed merely worn
as a badge his rank as a gentleman without
his hand having the least purpose becoming
acquainted with the hilt or his eye with the blade
his countenance was thin and acute marked with
lines which thought rather than age had traced
upon it and a habitual sneer on his countenance
even when he least wished to express contempt on
his features seemed to assure the person addressed
that in bletson he conversed with a person 
intellect far superior to his own this was a triumph
 intellect only for on all occasions difference
respecting speculative opinions and indeed
on all controversies whatsoever bletson
avoided the ultimate ratio blows and knocks
yet this peaceful gentleman had found himself
obliged to serve personally in the parliamentary
army at the commencement the civil war till
happening unluckily to come in contact with the
fiery prince rupert his retreat was judged so
precipitate that it required all the shelter his
woodstock befriends
could afford to keep him free an impeachment
or a courtmartial but as bletson spoke welland
with great effect in the house commons
which was his natural sphere and was on that account
high in the estimation his party his behaviour
at edgehill was passed over and he continued
to take an active share in all the political
events that bustling period though he faced
not again the actual front war
bletsons theoretical principles politics had
long inclined him to espouse the opinions 
harrison and others who adopted the visionary
idea establishing a pure democratical republic
in so extensive a country as britain this was a
rash theory where there is such an infinite difference
betwixt ranks habits education and morals
where there is such an immense disproportion
betwixt the wealth individuals and where a
large proportion the inhabitants consists the
inferior classes the large towns and manufacturing
districts men unfitted to bear that share
in the direction a state which must be exercised
by the members a republic in the proper
sense the word accordingly so soon as
woodstock
the experiment was made it became obvious that
no such form government could be adopted
with the smallest chance stability and the
question came only to be whether the remnant
or as it was vulgarly called the rump the
long parliament now reduced by the seclusion
 so many the members to a few scores 
persons should continue in spite their unpopularity
to rule the affairs britain whether
they should cast all loose by dissolving themselves
and issuing writs to convoke a new parliament
the composition which no one could answer for
any more than for the measures they might take
when assembled or lastly whether cromwell
as actually happened was not to throw the sword
into the balance and boldly possess himself 
that power which the remnant the parliament
were unable to hold and yet afraid to resign 
such being the state parties the council 
state in distributing the good things in their
gift endeavoured to soothe and gratify the army
as a beggar flings crusts to a growling mastiff
in this view desborough had been created
a commissioner in the woodstock matter to gras

tiny cromwell harrison to soothe the fierce fifthmonarchy
men and bletson as a sincere republican
and one their own leaven
but if they supposed bletson had the least intention
 becoming a martyr to his republicanism
or submitting to any serious loss on account it
they much mistook the man he entertained their
principles sincerely and not the less that they were
found impracticable for the miscarriage his
experiment no more converts the political speculator
than the explosion a retort undeceives an
alchemist but bletson was quite prepared to submit
to cromwell or any one else who might be possessed
 the actual authority he was a ready
subject in practice to the powers existing and made
little difference betwixt various kinds government
holding in theory all to be nearly equal in
imperfection so soon as they diverged from the
model harrington's oceana cromwell had already
been tampering with him like wax between
his finger and thumb and which he was ready
shortly to seal with smiling at the same time to
himself when he beheld the council state giving
rewards to bletson as their faithful adherent while
 woodstock
he himself was secure his allegiance how soon
soever the expected change government should
take place
but bletson was still more attached to his metaphysical
than his political creed and carried his
doctrines the perfectibility mankind as far ashe
did those respecting the conceivable perfection 
a model government and as in the one case he
declared against all power which did not emanate
from the people themselves so in his moral speculations
he was unwilling to refer any the phenomena
 nature to a final cause when pushed
indeed very hard bletson was compelled to mutter
some inarticulate and unintelligible doctrines
concerning an animus mundi or creative power
in the works nature by which she originally
called into existence and still continues to preserve
her works to this power he said some the purest
metaphysicians rendered a certain degree 
homage nor was he himself inclined absolutely to
censure those who by institution holidays choral
dances songs and harmless feasts and libations
might be disposed to celebrate the great goddess
nature at least dancing singing feasting and
woodstock 
sporting being comfortable things to both young
and old they might as well sport dance and feast
in honour such appointed holidays as under any
other pretext but then this moderate show religion
was to be practised under such exceptions
as are admitted by the highgate oath and no one
was to be compelled to dance drink sing or feast
whose taste did not happen to incline them to
such advertisements nor was any one to be compelled
to worship the creative power whether under
the name the animus mundi or any other
whatsoever the interference the deity in the
affairs mankind he entirely disowned having
proved to his own satisfaction that the idea originated
entirely in priestcraft in short with the
shadowy metaphysical exception aforesaid mr
joshua bletson darlington member for littlecreed
came as near the predicament an atheist
as it is perhaps possible for a man to do but
we say this with the necessary salvo for we have
known many like bletson whose curtains have
been shrewdly shaken by superstition though their
fears were unsanctioned by any religious faith
the devils we are assured believe and tremble 
 woodstock
but on earth there are many who in worse plight
than even the natural children perdition tremble
without believing and fear even while they blaspheme

it follows course that nothing could be
treated with more scorn by mr bletson than the
debates about prelacy and presbytery about presbytery
and independency about quakers and anabaptists
muggletonians and brownish and all the
various sects by which the civil war had commenced
and by which its dissensions were still continued
 it was he said as if beasts burthen
should quarrel amongst themselves about the
fashion their halters and packsaddles instead
 embracing a favourable opportunity throwing
them aside other witty and pithy remarks he
used to make when time and place suited for instance
at the club called the rota frequented by
saint john and established by harrington for the
free discussion political and religious subjects
but when bletson was out this academy or
stronghold af philosophy he was very cautious how
he carried his contempt the general prejudice in
favour religion and christianity further than
woodstock 
an implied objection or a sneer if he hm an opportunity
 talking in private with an ingenuous
and intelligent youth he sometimes attempted to
make a proselyte and showed much address in
bribing the vanity inexperience by suggesting
that a mind like his ought to spurn the prejudices
impressed upon it in childhood and when assuming
the latus clavus reason assuring him
that such as he laying aside the bulla juvenile
incapacity as bletson called it should proceed to
examine and decide for himself it frequently happened
that the youth was induced to adopt the
doctrines in whole or in part the sage who had
seen his natural genius and who had urged him
to exert it in examining detecting and declaring
for himself and thus flattery gave proselytes to
infidelity which could not have been gained by
all the powerful eloquence or artful sophistry 
the infidel
these attempts to extend the influence what
was called freethinking and philosophy were carried
on as we have hinted with a caution dictated
by the timidity the philosopher's disposition
he was conscious his doctrines were
 woodstock
suspected and his proceedings watched by the
two principal sects relations and presbyterians
who however inimical to each other were still more
hostile to one who was an opponent not only to a
church establishment any kind but to every
denomination christianity he found it more
easy to shroud himself among the independents
whose demands were for a general liberty conscience
or an unlimited toleration and whose faith
differing in all respects and particulars was by
some pushed into such wild errors as to get totally
beyond the bounds every species christianity
and approach very near to infidelity itself as extremes
 each kind are said to approach each
other bletson mixed a good deal among those
sectaries and such was his confidence in his own
logic and address that he is supposed to have entertained
hopes bringing to his opinions in time
the enthusiastic vane as well as the no less enthusiastic
hanson providing he could but get
them to resign their visions a fifth monarchy
and induce them to be contented with a reign 
philosophers in england for the natural period
 their lives instead the reign the saints
kiing the millennium
woodstock 
such was the singular group into which everard
was now introduced showing in their various
opinions upon how many devious coasts human
nature may make shipwreck when she has one e
let go her hold on the anchor which religion has
given her to lean upon the acute selfconceit and
worldly learning bletson the rash and ignorant
conclusions the fierce and underbred harrison
leading them into the opposite extremes enthusiasm
and infidelity while desborough constitutionally
stupid thought nothing about religion at
all and while the others were active in making
sail on different but equally erroneous courses
he might be said to perish like a vessel which
springs a leak and founders in the roadstead it
was wonderful to behold what a strange variety
 mistakes and errors on the part the king and
his ministers on the part the parliament and
their leaders on the part the allied kingdoms 
scotland and england towards each other had
combined to rear up men such dangerous opinions
and interested characters among the arbiters
 the destiny britain
those who argue for party's sake will sec all the
 vood stock
faults on the olio side without deigning to look at
those on the other those who study history for
instruction will perceive that nothing but the want
 concession on either side and the deadly height
to which the animosity the king's and parliaments
parties had arisen could have so totally
overthrown the wellpoised balance the english
constitution but we hasten to quit political reflections
the rather that ours we believe will
please neither whig nor tory

mb bletson arose and paid his respects to
colonel everard with the ease and courtesy a
gentleman the time though on every account
grieved at his intrusion as a religious man who
held his free thinking principles in detestation and
would effectually prevent his conversion harrison
and even desborough if anything could be
moulded out such a clod to the worship the
animus mundi moreover bletson knew everard
to be a man steady probity and by no
means disposed to close with a scheme on which
he had successfully sounded the other two and
which was calculated to assure the commissioners
 woodstock
 some little private indemnification for the trouble
they were to give themselves in the public business
the philosopher was yet less pleased when
he saw the magistrate and the pastor who had met
him in his flight the preceding evening when
he had been seen parma non bene 'elicta with
cloak and doublet left behind him
the presence colonel everard was as unpleasing
to desborough as to bletson but the
former having no philosophy in him nor an idea
that it was possible for any man to resist helping
himself out untold money was chiefly embarrassed
by the thought that the plunder which they
might be able to achieve out their trust might
by this unwelcome addition to their number be
divided into four parts instead three and this
reflection added to the natural awkwardness with
which he grumbled forth a sort welcome addressed
to everard
as for harrison he remained like one on
higher thoughts intent his posture unmoved his
eyes fixed on the ceiling as before and no part 
him indicated the least consciousness that the company
had been more than doubled around him
 woodstock 
meantime everard took his place at the table
as a man who assumed his own right and
pointed to his companions to sit down nearer the
foot the board wildrake so far misunderstood
his signals as to sit down above the mayor 
but rallying his recollection at a look from his
patron he rose and took his place lower whistling
however as he went a sound at which the
company stared as at a freedom highly unbecoming
to complete his indecorum he seized
upon a pipe and filling it from a large tobaccobox
was soon immersed in a cloud his own
raising from which a hand shortly after emerged
seized on the blackjack ale withdrew it within
the vapoury sanctuary and after a potential
draught replaced it upon the table its owner beginning
to renew the cloud which his intermitted
exercise the tube had almost allowed to subside

nobody made any observation on his conduct
out respect probably to colonel everard who
bit his lip but continued silent aware that censure
might extract something more unequivocally chains
woodstock 
racteristic a cavalier from his refractory companion
as silence seemed too awkward and the
others made no advances to break it beyond the
ordinary salutation colonel everard at length
said i presume gentlemen that you are somewhat
surprised at my arrival here and thus intruding
myself into your meeting
why the dickens should we be surprised
colonel said desborough we know his excellency
my brotherinlaw noll's i mean my
lord cromwell's way overquartering his menin
the towns he marches through thou hast
obtained a share in our commission 
and in that's said bletson smiling and bowing
 the lordgeneral has given us the most
acceptable colleague that could have been added
to our number no doubt your authority for joining
with us must be under warrant the council
 state 
 that gentlemen said the colonel i
will presently advise you he took omit his
warrant accordingly and was about to communicate
the contents but observing that there were
three or four halfempty flasks upon the table
 woodstock sj
that defiborough looked more stupid than usual
and that the philosopher's eyes were reeling in
his head notwithstanding the temperance 
bletson's usual habits he concluded that they
had been fortifying themselves against the horrors
 the haunted mansion by laying in a store
 what is called dutch courage and therefore
prudently'resolved to postpone his more important
business with them till the cooler hour morning
he therefore instead presenting the general's
warrant superseding their commission contented
himself with replying my business
has course some reference to your proceedings
here but here is excuse my curiosity 
a reverend gentleman pointing to holdenough
who has told me that you are so strangely embarrassed
here as to require both the civil and
spiritual authority to enable you to keep possession
 woodstock
before we go into that matter said bletson
blushing up to the eyes at the recollection his
own fears so manifestly displayed yet so inconsistent
with his principles i should like to know
who this other stranger is who has come with the
vol i t
 woodstock 
worthy magistrate and the no less worthy presbyterians

meaning me said wildrake laying his
pipe aside gadzooks the time hath been that
i could have answered the question with a better
title but at present i am only his honour's peer
clerk or secretary whichever is the current
phrase
fore george my lively blade thou art a frank
fellow thy tattle said desborough there is
my secretary tomkins whom men sillily enough
call gibbet and the honourable lieutenant general
harrison's secretary bibbet who are now at
supper below stairs that durst not for their ears
speak a phrase above their breath in the presence
 their betters unless to answer a question
yes colonel everard said the philosopher
with his quiet smile glad apparently to divert
the conversation from the topic last night's
alarm and recollections which humbled his selflove
and selfsatisfaction yes and when master
bibbet and master bibbet do speak their affirmations
are as much in a common mould mutual
attestation as their names would accord m the
j
i
woodstock 
verses a poet if master gibbet happens to tell
a fiction master bibbet swears it as truth if
master bibbet chances to have gotten drunk in
the fear the lord master gibbet swears he is
sober i have called my own secretary gibbet
though his name chances to be only gibeon a
worthy israelite at your service but as pure a
youth as ever picked a lambbone at paschal but
i call him gibbet merely to make up the holy
trefoil with another rhyme this squire thine
colonel everard looks as if he might be worthy
to be coupled with the rest the fraternity
not i truly said the cavalier i'll be
coupled with no jew that was ever whelped and
no jewess neither
 scorn not for that young man said the philosopher
 the jews are in point religion
the elder brethren you know
the jews older than the christians said
desborough fore george they will have thee
before the general assembly bletson if thou
ventures to say so
wildrake laughed without ceremony at the
gross ignorance desborough and was joined by
 woodstock
a smuggling response from behind the cupboard
which when inquired into proved to be produced
by the servingmen these worthies timorous as
their betters when they had set down the lights
and were supposed to have left the room had only
absconded behind their present place concealment

how now ye rogues said bletson angrily 
do you not know your duty better 
we beg your worthy honour's pardon said
one the men but we had set the candlesticks
down on the table and truly we dared not go
down stairs till we should get a light
a light ye cowardly poltroons said the
philosopher what to show which you looks
palest when a rat squeaks but take a candlestick
and begone you cowardly villains the devils
you are so much afraid must be but paltry
kites if they hawk at such bats as you are
the servants without replying took up one 
the candlesticks and prepared to retreat trusty
tomkins at the head the troop when suddenly
as they arrived at the door the parlour which
had been left half open it was shut violently
woodstock 
the three terrified domestics tumbled back into
the middle the room as if a shot had been discharged
in their face and all who were at the table
started to their feet
colonel everard was incapable a moment's
fear even if anything frightful had been seen 
but he remained stationary to see what his companions
would do and to get at the bottom if possible
 the cause their alarm upon an occasion
so trifling the philosopher seemed to think that
he was the person chiefly concerned to show manhood
on the occasion
he walked to the door accordingly murmuring
at the cowardice the servants but at such a
snails pace that it seemed he would most willingly
have been anticipated by any one whom his
reproaches had roused to exertion cowardly
blockheads he said at last seizing hold the
handle the door but without turning it effectually
round dare you not open a door 
still fumbling with the lock dare you not go
down a staircase without a light here bring
me the candle you cowardly villains by heaven
something sighs on the outside 
 woodstock
as he spoke he let go the handle the parlour
door and stepped back a pace or two into the
apartment with cheeks as pale as the band he
wore
deus adductor mens r said the presbyterian
clergyman rising from his seat give place
sir addressing bletson it would seem i know
more this matter than thou and i bless heaven
i am armed for the conflict
bold as a grenadier about to mount a breach
yet with the same belief in the existence a great
danger to be encountered as well as the same reliance
in the goodness his cause the worthy man
stepped before the philosophical bletson and taking
a light from a sconce in one hand quietly
opened the door with the other and standing in
the threshold said here is nothing i
and who expected to see anything said
bletson excepting those terrified oafs who take
fright at every puff wind that whistles through
the passages this old dungeon 
mark you master tomkins said one the
waitingmen in a whisper to the steward see
how boldly the minister pressed forward before
woodstock 
all them ah master tomkins our parson is
the real commissioned officer the church your
laypreachers are no better than a parcel clubmen
and volunteers
follow me those who list said master holdenough
or go before me those who choose i
will walk through the habitable places this house
before i leave it and satisfy myself whether satan
hath really mingled himself among these dreary
dens ancient wickedness or whether like the
wicked whom holy david speaketh we are
afraid and flee when no one pursued
harrison who had heard these words sprung
from his seat and drawing his sword exclaimed
were there as many fiends in the house as there
are hairs on my head upon this cause i will charge
them up to their very trenches 
so saying he brandished his weapon and pressed
to the head the column where he moved side
by side with the minister the mayor woodstock
next joined the body thinking himself safer
perhaps in the company his pastor and the
whole train moved forward in close order accompanied
by the servants bearing lights to search
woodstock
the lodge for some cause that panic with which
they seemed to be suddenly seized
nay take me with you my friends said
colonel everard who had looked on in surprise
and was now about to follow the party when bletson
laid hold on his cloak and begged him to remain

you see my good colonels he said affecting
a courage which his shaking voice belied
here are only you and i and honest lesbos
left behind in garrison while all the others
are absent on a sally we must not hazard the
whole troops in one sortie that were unmilitary
ha ha ha i
in the name heaven what means all this 
said everard i heard a foolish tale about apparitions
as i came this way and now i find you
all half mad with fear and cannot get a word 
sense among so many you fie colonel desborough
 fie master bletson try to compose
yourselves and let me know in heaven's name
the cause all this disturbance one would be
apt to think your brains were turned
 and so mine well may said desborough
woodstock 
 ay and overturned too since my bed last night
was turned upside down and i was placed for ten
minutes heels uppermost and head downcast like
a bullock going to be shod
what means this nonsense master bletson 
desborough must have had the nightmare
 no faith colonel the goblins or whatever
else they were had been favourable to honest desborough
for they reposed the whole his person
on that part his body which hark did you
not hear something sis the central point gravity
namely his head
did you see anything to alarm you said
the colonel
nothing said bletson but we heard hellish
noises as all our people did and i believing
little ghosts and apparitions concluded the cavaliers
were taking us at advantage so remembering
gainsborough's fate i e'en jumped the
window and ran to woodstock to call the soldiers
to the rescue harrison and desborough
and did you not first go to see what the danger
was 
 ah my good friend you forget that i laid
woodstock
down my commission at the time the selfdenying
ordinance it would have been quite inconsistent
with my duty as a parliamentman to be
brawling amidst a set ruffians with any military
authority no when the parliament commanded
me to sheathe my sword colonel i have too
much veneration for their authority to be found
again with it drawn in my hand
but the parliament said desborough hastily
 did not command you to use your heels
when your hands could have saved a man from
choking gods dickens you might have stopped
when you saw my bed canted heels uppermost
and me half stifled in the bedclothes you might
i say have stopped and lent a hand to put it to
rights instead jumping out window like a
new shorn sheep so soon as you had run across
my room
nay worshipful master desborough said
bletson winking on everard to show that he was
playing on his thickskulled colleague how could
i tell your particular mode reposing there
are many tastes i have known men who slept by
choice on a slope or angle fortyfives
woodstock 
yes but did ever a man sleep standing on
his head except by miracle said desborough
 now as to miracles said the philosopher
confident in the presence everard besides that
an opportunity scoffing at religion really in some
degree diverted his fear i leave these out 
the question seeing that the evidence on such
subjects seems as little qualified to carry conviction
as a horsehair to land a leviathan
a loud clap thunder or a noise as formidable
rang through the lodge as the scoffer had
ended which struck him pale and motionless and
made desborough throw himself on his knees and
repeat exclamations and prayers in much admired
confusion
there must be contrivance here exclaimed
everard and snatching one the candles from
a sconce he rushed out the apartment little
heeding the entreaties the philosopher who in
the extremity his distress conjured him by the
animus mundi to remain to the assistance a
distressed philosopher endangered by witches
and a parliamentman assaulted by ruffians as
for desborough he only gaped like a clown in a
 woodstock
pantomime and doubtful whether to follow or
stop his natural indolence prevailed and he sat
still
when on the landingplace the stairs everard
paused a moment to consider which was the
best course to take he heard the voices men
talking fast and loud like people who wish to drown
their fears in the lower story and aware that nothing
could be discovered by those whose inquiries
were conducted in a manner so noisy he resolved
to proceed in a different direction and examine
the second floor which he had now gained
he had known every corner both the inhabited
and uninhabited part the mansion
and availed himself the candle to traverse two
or three intricate passages which he was afraid
he might not remember with sufficient accuracy
this movement conveyed him to a sort oeuil
debeiif an octagon vestibule or small hall from
which various rooms opened amongst these
doors everard selected that which led to a very
long narrow and dilapidated gallery built in the
time henry viii and running along the whole
southwest side the building communicating at
woodstock 
different points with the rest the mansion this
he thought was likely to be the post occupied by
those who proposed to act the sprites upon the occasion
 especially as its length and shape gave him
some idea that it was a spot where the bold thunder
might in many ways be imitated
determined to ascertain the truth if possible he
placed his light on a table in the vestibule and
applied himself to open the door into the gallery
at this point he found himself strongly opposed
either by a bolt drawn or as he rather conceived
by somebody from within resisting his attempt
he was induced to believe the latter because the
resistance slackened and was renewed like that 
human strength instead presenting the permanent
opposition an inanimate obstacle though
everard was a strong and active young man he
exhausted his strength in the vain attempt to open
the door and having paused to take breath was
about to renew his efforts with foot and shoulder
and to call at the same time for assistance when
to his surprise on again attempting the door more
gently in order to ascertain if possible where the
strength the opposing obstacle was situated he
i
 woodstock
found it give way to a very slight impulse some
impediment fell broken to the ground and the
door flew wide open the gust wind occasioned
by the sudden opening the door blew out
the candle and everard was left in darkness
save where the moonshine which the long siderow
 latticed windows dimmed could imperfectly
force its way into the gallery which lay in
ghostly length before him
the melancholy and doubtful twilight was increased
by a quantity creeping plants on the
outside which since all had been neglected in
these ancient halls now completely overgrown had
in some instances greatly diminished and in others
almost quite choked up the space the lattices
extending between the heavy stone shaftwork
which divided the windows both lengthways and
across on the other side there were no windows
at all and the gallery had been once completely
hung with paintings chiefly portraits by which
that side the apartment had been adorned
most the pictures had been removed yet the
empty frames some and the tattered remnants
 others were still visible along the extent 
woodstock sos
the waste gallery the look which was so desolate
and so well adapted besides for mischief
supposing there were enemies near him that everard
could not help pausing at the entrance and
recommending himself to god ere drawing his
sword he advanced into the apartment treading
as lightly as possible and keeping in the shadow
as much as he could
markham everard was by no means superstitious
but he had the usual credulity his times 
and though he did not yield easily to tales supernatural
visitations yet he could not help thinking
he was in the very situation where if such
things were ever permitted they might be expected
to take place while his own stealthy and
ill assured pace his drawn weapon and extended
arms being the very attitude and action doubt
and suspicion tended to increase in his mind the
gloomy feelings which they are the usual indications
and with which they are constantly associated
under such unpleasant impressions and
conscious the neighbourhood something unfriendly
colonel everard had already advanced
about half along the gallery when he heard some
y
 woodstock
one sigh very near him and a low soft voice pronounce
his name
here i am he replied while his heart beat
thick and short who calls on markham everard
t
another sigh was the only answer
 speak said the colonel whoever or whatsoever
you are and tell with what intent and purpose
you are lurking in these apartments 
with a better intent than yours returned
the soft voice
than mine answered everard in great
surprise who are you that dare judge my
intents 
what or who are you markham everard
who wander by moonlight through these deserted
halls royalty where none should be but those
who mourn their downfall or are sworn to avenge
it 
it is and yet it cannot be said everard 
yet it is and must be alice lee the devil or
you speaks answer me i conjure you speak
openly on what dangerous scheme are you engaged
 where is your father why are you here
woodstock 
wherefore do you run so deadly a venture 
speak i conjure you alice lee 
she whom you call on is at the distance 
miles from this spot what if her genius speaks
when she is absent what if the soul an ancestress
 hers and yours were now addressing
you what if 
nay answered everard but what if the
dearest human beings has caught a touch 
her father's enthusiasm what if she is exposing
her person to danger her reputation to
scandal by traversing in disguise and in darkness
a house filled with armed men speak tome
my fair cousin in your own person i am
furnished with powers to protect my uncle sir
henry to protect you too dearest alice even
against the consequences this visionary and
wild attempt speak i see where you are and
with all my respect i cannot submit to be thus
practised upon trust me trust your cousin
markham with your hand and believe that he
will die or place you in honourable safety
as he spoke he exercised his eyes as keenly as
possible to detect where the speaker stood and
vol i u
 woodstock
it seemed to him that about three ytirds from him
there was a shadowy form which he could not
discern even the outline placed as it was within the
deep and prolonged shadow thrown by a space 
wall intervening betwixt two windows upon that
side the room from which the light was admitted
he endeavoured to calculate as well as he
could the distance betwixt himself and the object
which he watched under the impression that if
by even using a slight degree compulsion he
could detach his beloved alice from the confederacy
into which he supposed her father's zeal for
the cause royalty had engaged her he would
be rendering them both the most essential favour
he could not indeed but conclude that however
successfully the plot which he conceived to be in
agitation had proceeded against the timid bletson
the stupid desborough and the crazy harrison
there was little doubt that at length their artifices
must necessarily bring shame and danger on those
engaged in it
it must also be remembered that everard's affection
to his cousin although the most respectful
and devoted character partook less the diswoodstock

want veneration which a lover those days entertained
for the lady whom he worshipped with
humble diffidence than the fond and familiar
feelings which a brother entertains towards a
younger sister whom he thinks himself entitled
to guide advise and even in some degree to control
so idndly and intimate had been their intercourse
that he had little more hesitation in endeavouring
to arrest her progress in the dangerous
course in which she seemed to be engaged even
at the risk giving her momentary offence than
he would have had in snatching her from a torrent
or conflagration at the chance hurting her by
the violence his grasp all this passed through
his mind in the course a single minute and he
resolved at all events to detain her on the spot
and compel if possible an explanation from her
with this purpose everard again conjured his
cousin in the name heaven to give up this idle
and dangerous mummery and lending an accurate
ear to her answer endeavoured from the sound
to calculate as nearly as possible the distance between
them
i am not she for whom you take me said
 woodstock
the voice and dearer regards than aught connected
with her life or death bid me warn you to
keep aloof and leave this place
not till i have convinced you your childish
folly said the colonel springing forward and
endeavouring to catch hold her who spoke to
him but no female form was within his grasp
on the contrary he was met by a shock which
could come from no woman's arm and which was
rude enough to stretch him on his back on the
floor at the same time he felt the point a
sword at his throat and his hands so completely
mastered that not the slightest defence remained
to him
 a cry for assistance said a voice near him
but not that which he had hitherto heard will be
stifled in your blood no harm is meant you 
be wise and be silent
the fear death which everard had often
braved in the field battle became more horrible
as he felt himself in the hands unknown assassins
and totally devoid all means defence
the sharp point the sword pricked his bare
throat and the foot him who held it was upon
woodstock 
his breast he felt it was to be a single thrust
and an there would be life and all the feverish
joys and sorrows which agitate us so strangely
and from which we are yet so reluctant to part
large drops perspiration stood upon his forehead
 this heart throbbed as if it would burst from
its confinement in the bosom she experienced the
agony which fear imposes on the brave man acute
in proportion to that which pain inflicts when it
subdues the robust and healthy
cousin alice he attempted to speak and
the sword's point pressed his throat yet more
closely cousin let me not be murdered in a
manner so fearful 
i tell you replied the voice that you
speak to one who is not here but your life is
not aimed at providing you swear on your faith
as a christian and your honour as a gentleman
that you will conceal what has happened whether
from the people below or from any other person
on this condition you may rise and if you seek
her you will find alice lee at joceline's cottage
in the forest
since i may not help myself otherwise said
 woodstock
everard i swear as i have a sense religion
and honour i will say nothing this violence
nor make any search after those who are concerned
in it
for that we care nothing said the voice
thou hast an example how well thou may'st
catch mischief on thy own part but we are incase
to defy thee bise and begone 
the foot the sword'spoint were withdrawn
and everard was about to start up hastily when
the voice in the same softness tone which distinguished
it at first said no haste cold and
bare steel is yet around thee now now snow
the words dying away as at a distance thou
art free be secret and be safe
markham everard arose and in rising embarrassed
his feet with his own sword which he
had dropped when springing forward as he supposed
to lay hold his fair cousin he snatched
it up in haste and as his hand clasped the hilt
his courage which had given way under the apprehension
 instant death began to return he
considered with almost his usual composure
what was to be done next deeply affronted at the
woodstock 
disgrace which he had sustained he questioned
for an instant whether he ought to keep his extorted
promise or should not rather summon assistance
and make haste to discover and seize
those who had been recently engaged in such violence
on his person but these persons be they
who they would had had his life in their power 
he had pledged his word in ransom it and
what was more he could not divest himself the
idea that his beloved alice was a confidante at
least if not an actor in the confederacy which
had thus baffled him this prepossession determined
his conduct for though angry at supposing
she must have been accessary to his personal
illtreatment he could not in any event think 
an instant search through the mansion which might
have committed her safety or that his uncle
but i will to the hut he said i will instantly
to the hut ascertain her share in this wild
and dangerous confederacy and snatch her from
ruin if it be possible
as under the influence the resolution which
he had formed everard groped his way through
the gallery and regained the vestibule he heard
 woodstock
his name called by the wellknown voice wild 
rake what ho houo colonel everard
mark everard it is dark as the devil's mouth
speak where are you the witches are keeping
their hellish sabbath here as i think where
are you 
here here answered everard cease
your bawling turn to the left and you will meet
me
guided by his voice wildrake soon appeared
with a light in one hand and his drawn sword in
the other where have you been i he said 
what has detained you here are bletson and
the brute desborough terrified out their lives
and harrison raving mad because the devil will
not be civil enough to rise to fight him
saw or heard you nothing as you came
along said everard
nothing said his friend excepting that
when i first entered this cursed ruinous labyrinth
the light was struck out my hand as if by a
switch which obliged me to return for another
i must come by a horse instantly wildrake
and another for thyself if it be possible
woodstock is
we can take two those belonging to the
troopers answered wildrake but for what
purpose should we run away like rats at this time
in the evening is the house falling 
i cannot answer you said the colonel pushing
forward into a room where there were some remains
 furniture
here the cavalier took a more strict view his
person and exclaimed in wonder what the
devil have you been fighting with markham that
has bedizened you after this sorry fashion 
fighting exclaimed everard
 yes replied his trusty attendant i say
fighting look at yourself in the mirror
he did and saw he was covered with dust and
blood the latter proceeded from a scratch which
he had received in the throat as he struggled to
extricate himself with unaffected alarm wildrake
undid his friend's collar and with eager
haste proceeded to examine the wound his hands
trembling and his eyes glistening with apprehension
for his benefactor's life when in spite 
everard's opposition he had examined the hurt
vol i x
 woodstock
and found it so trifling he resumed the natural
wildness his character perhaps the more readily
that he had felt shame in departing from it into
one which expressed more feeling than he would
be thought to possess
if that be the devils work mark said he
the foul fiend's claws are not nigh so formidable
as they are represented but no one shall say that
your blood has been shed unrevenged while roger
wildrake was by your side where left you
this same imp i will back to the field fight
confront him with my rapier and were his nails
tenpenny nails and his teeth as long as those 
a harrow he shall render me reason for the injury
he has done you
madness madness exclaimed everard 
i had this trifling hurt by a fall a basin and
towel will wipe it away meanwhile if you will ever
do me kindness get the troophorses command
them for the service the public in the name 
his excellency the general i will but wash and
join you in an instant before the gate
well i will serve you everard as a mute
serves the grand signior without knowing why
woodstock 
or wherefore but will you go without seeing
these people below 
without seeing any one said everard
lose no time for god's sake
he found out the noncommissioned officer
and demanded the horses in a tone authority to
which the corporal yielded undisputed obedience
as one well aware colonel everard's military
rank and consequence so all was in a minute or
two ready for the expedition 


 you also expected to visit there
yourself and so keep watch over pretty mistress
lee eh 
i never entertained so selfish a thought
said everard and if this nocturnal disturbance
at the mansion were explained and ended
i would instantly take my departure
 your friend noll would expect something
more from you said avildrake he would
expect in case the knight's reputation for loyalty
should draw any our poor exiles and wanderers
about the lodge that you should be on
the watch and ready to snap them in a word
as far as i can understand his longwinded
speechesshe would have woodstock a trap
your uncle and his pretty daughter the bait 
toasted cheesescraving your chloe's pardon for
the comparison you the springfall which should
bar their escape his lordship himself being the
great grimalkin to whom they arc to be given
over to be devoured
dared cromwell mention this to thee in express
terms said everard pulling up historic
and stopping in the midst the road
 woodstock
nay not in express terms which i do not
believe he ever used in his life you might as
well expect a drunken man to go straight forward
but he insinuated as much to me and
indicated that you might deserve well him 
gatzo the damnable proposal sticks in my
throat by betraying our noble and rightful
king here he pulled oflp his hat whom god
grant in health and wealth long to reign as the
worthy clergyman says though i fear just now
his majesty is both sick and sorry and never a
penny in his pouch to boot
this tallies with what alice hinted said
everard but how could she know it didst
thou give her any hint such a thing 
i replied the cavalier i who never saw
mistress alice in my life till tonight and then
only for an instant zooks man how is that possible

true replied everard and seemed lost in
thought at length he spoke i should call
cromwell to account for his bad opinion me 
for even though not seriously expressed but as
i am convinced it was with the sole view prowoodstock

wing you and perhaps myself it was nevertheless
a misconstruction to be resented
i'll carry a cartel for you with all my heart
and soul said wildrake and turn out with
his godliness second with as good will as i ever
drank a glass sack
pshaw replied everard those in his high
place fight no singular combats but tell me
roger wildrake didst thou thyself think me capable
 the falsehood and treachery implied in
such a message 
i exclaimed wildrake markham everard
you have been my early friend my constant
benefactor when colchester was reduced you
saved me from the gallows and since that thou
hast twenty times saved me from starving but
by heaven if i thought you capable such villainy
as your general recommended by yonder
blue sky and all the works creation which it
bends over i would stab you with my own
hand 
death replied everard i should indeed
deserve but not from you perhaps but fortunately
i cannot if i would be guilty the
 woodstock
treachery you would punish know that i had
this day secret notice and from cromwell himself
that the young man has escaped by sea from
bristol
now god almighty be blessed who protected
him through so many dangers exclaimed
wildrake huzza up hearts cavaliers 
hey for cavaliers god bless king charles 
moon and stars catch my hat and he threw
it up as high as he could into the air the celestial
bodies which he invoked did not receive
the present dispatched to them but as in the
case sir henry lee's scabbard an old gnarled
oak became a second time the receptacle a
waif and stray loyal enthusiasm wildrake
looked rather foolish at the circumstance and
his friend took the opportunity admonishing
him
art thou not ashamed to bear thee so like a
schoolboy 
why said wildrake i have but sent a
puritan's hat upon a loyal errand i laugh to
think how many the schoolboys thou talk'st 
will be cheated into climbing the pollard next
woodstock si
year expecting to find the nest some unknown
bird in yonder unmeasured margin felt
hush now for god's sake and let us speak
calmly said everard charles has escaped
and i am glad it i would willingly have seen
him on his father's throne by composition but
not by the force the scottish army and the
incensed and vengeful royalists 
master markham everard began the cavalier
interrupting him
nay hush dear wildrake said everard 
let us not dispute a point on which we cannot
agree and give me leave to go on i say since
the young man has escaped cromwell offensive
and injurious stipulation falls to the ground and
i see not why my uncle and his family should
not again enter their own house under the same
terms connivance as many other royalists
what may be incumbent on me is different nor
can i determine my course until i have an interview
with the general which as i think will
 in his confessing that he threw in this offensive
proposal to sound us both it is much in his
u
it
 woodstock
manner for he is blunt and never sees or feels
the punctilious honour which the gallants the
day stretch to such delicacy
 acquit him for having any punctilio
about him said wildrake either touching
honour or honesty now to come back to where
we started supposing you were not to reside in
person at the lodge and to forbear even visiting
there unless on invitation when such a thing
can be brought about i tell you frankly i think
your uncle and his daughter might be induced
to come back to the lodge and reside there as
usual at least the clergyman that worthy old
cock gave me to hope as much
he had been hasty in bestowing his confine
hence said everard
true replied wildrake he confided in
in me at once for he instantly saw my regard
for the church i thank heaven i never passed
a clergyman in his canonicals without pulling my
hat off and thou knowest the most desperate
duel lever fought was with young gray less the
inner temple for taking the wall the reverend
dr dunce ah i can gain a chaplain's ear inwoodstock

scanty gadzooks they know whom they have
to trust to in such a one as i
dost thou think then said colonel everard
 or rather does this clergyman think that
if they were secure intrusion from me the family
would return to the lodge supposing the
intruding commissioners gone and this nocturnal
disturbance explained and ended 
the old knight answered wildrake maybe
wrought upon by the doctor to return if he
is secure against intrusion as for disturbances
the stout old boy so far as i can learn in two
minutes conversation laughs at all this turmoil
as the work mere imagination the consequence
 the remorse their own evil consciences 
and says that goblin or devil was never heard 
at woodstock until it became the residence 
such men as they who have now usurped the possessions

there is more than imagination in it said
everard i have personal reason to know there
is some conspiracy carrying on to render the
house untenantable by the commissioners i acquit
my uncle accession to such a silly trick 
vol c
 woodstock
but i must see it ended ere i can agree to his
and my cousin's residing where such a confederacy
exists for they are likely to be considered
as the contrivers such pranks be the actual
agent who he may
with reverence to your better acquaintance
with the gentleman everard i should rather
suspect the old father puritans i beg your
pardon again has something to do with the business
 and if so lucifer will never look near
the true old knight's beard nor abide a glance
 yonder maiden's innocent blue eyes i will
uphold them as safe as pure gold in a miser's
chest
safest thou aught thyself which makes thee
think thus 
not a quill the devil's pinion saw i replied
wildrake he supposes himself too secure
 an old cavalier who must steal hang or drown
in the long run so he gives himself no trouble to
look after the assured booty but i heard the
servingfellows prate what they had seen and
heard and though their tales were confused
enough yet if there was any truth among them
woodstock
at all i should say the devil must have been in
the dance but hollo here comes some one
upon us stand friend who art thou 
a poor daylabourer in the great work 
england joseph tomkins by name secretary
to a godly and wellendowed leader in this poor
christian army england called general harrison

 what news master tomkins said everard
 and why are you on the road at this late
hours
i speak to the worthy colonel everard as
i judge said tomkins and truly i am glad
 meeting your honour heaven knows i need
such assistance as yours oh worthy master
everard here has been a sounding trumpets
and a breaking vials and a pouring
forth and 
prithee tell me in brief what is the matter
where is thy master and in a word what has
happened 
my master is close by parading it in the
little meadow beside the hugeous oak which is
called by the name the late man ride but two
steps forward and you may see him walking
wooijstocif
swiftly to and fro advancing all the while the
naked weapon
upon proceeding as directed but with as little
noise as possible they descried a man whom
 course they concluded must be harrison
walking to and fro beneath the king's oak as a
sentinel under arms but with more wildness 
demeanour the tramp the horses did not
escape his ear and they heard him call out as
if at the head the brigade lower pikes
against cavalry here comes prince rupertstand
fast and you shall turn them aside as a
bull would toss a curdog lower your pikes
still my hearts the secured against your foot
down on your right knee front rank spare
not for the spoiling your blue aprons ha 
zerobabel ay that is the word
in the name heaven about whom or
what is he talking said everard wherefore
does he go about with his weapon drawn 
truly sir when aught disturbs my master
general harrison he is something rapt in the
spirit and conceives that he is commanding a reserve
 pikes at the great battle armageddon
and for his weapon alack worthy sir wherefore
woodstock s
should he keep sheffield steel in calves leather
when there are fiends to be combated incarnate
fiends on earth and raging infernal fiends under
the earth 
 this is intolerable said everard listen
to me tomkins thou art not now in the
pulpit and i desire none thy preaching language
i know thou canst speak intelligibly
when thou art so minded remember i may
serve or harm thee and as you hope or fear anything
on my part answer straightforward 
what has happened to drive out thy master to
the wild wood at this time night
 forsooth worthy and honoured sir i will
speak with the precision i may true it is and
 verity that the breath man which is in his
nostrils goeth forth and returned 
hark you sir said colonel everard take
care where you ramble in your correspondence
with me you have heard how at the great battle
 dunbar in scotland the general himself
held a pistol to the head lieutenant hewcreed
threatening to shoot him through the brain
if he did not give up holding forth and put his
squadron in line to the front take care sir
 v i vj o
 woodstock
verily the lieutenant then charged with an
even and unbroken order said tomkins and
bore a thousand plaids and bonnets over the
beach before him into the sea neither shall i
pretermit or postpone your honour's commands
but speedily obey them and that without delay
 go to fellow thou knowest what i would
have said everard speak at once i know
thou canst if thou wilt trusty tomkins is better
known than he thinks for
worthy sir said tomkins in a much less
periphrastic style i will obey your worship as
far as the spirit will permit truly it was not an
hour since when my worshipful master being at
table with master bibbet and myself not to
mention the worshipful master bletson and colonel
desborough and behold there was a violent
knocking at the gate as one in haste now 
a certainty so much had our household been
harassed with witches and spirits and other objects
 sound and sight that the sentinels could
not be brought to abide upon their posts without
doors and it was only by provision beef and
strong liquors that we were able to maintain
a guard three men in the hall who neverthe
woodstock 
less ventured not to open the door lest they
should be surprised with some the goblins
wherewith their imaginations were overwhelmed
and they heard the knocking which increased
until it seemed that the door was well nigh about
to be beaten down worthy master bibbet was a
little overcome with liquor as is his fashion goodman
about this time the evening not that he
is in the least given to ebriety but simply that
since the scottish campaign he hath had a perpetual
ague which obliges him so to nourish his
frame against the damps the night wherefore
as it is well known to your honour that i
discharge the office a faithful servant as well
to majorgeneral harrison and the other commissioners
as to my just and lawful master colonel
desborough 
i know all that and now that thou art
trusted by both i pray to heaven thou may'st
merit the trust said colonel everard
and devoutly do i pray said tomkins
that your worshipful prayers may be answered
with favour for certainly to be and to be called
and entitled honest joe and trusty tomkins
is to me more than ever would be an ears title
 woodstockwere
such things to be granted anew in this regenerated
government
well go on go on or if thou tallest much
longer i will make bold to dispute the article 
your honesty i like short tales sir and doubt
what is told with a long unnecessary train 
words
well good sir be not hasty as i said before
thedoors rattled till you would have thought
the knocking was reiterated in every room 
the palace the bell rung out for company
though we could not find that any one tolled the
clapper and the guards let off their firelock merely
because they knew not what better to do so
master bibbet being as i said unsusceptible 
his duty i went down with my poor rapier to the
door and demanded who was there and i was
answered in a voice which i must say was
much like another voice that it was one wanting
majorgeneral harrison so as it was then late
i answered mildly that general harrison was
betaking himself to his rest and that any who
wished to speak to him must return on the morrow
morning for that after nightfall the door 
the palace being in the room a garrison would
woodstock 
be opened to no one so the voice replied and
bid me open directly without which he would
blow the folding leaves the door into the middle
 the hall and therewithal the noise recommenced
that we thought the house would
have fallen and i was in some measure constrained
to open the door even like a besieged garrison
which can hold out no longer
by my honour and it was stoutly done you
i must say said wildrake who had been listening
with much interest i am a bold daredevil
enough yet when i had two inches oak plank
between the actual fiend and me hang him that
would demolish the barrier between us say i
i would as soon when aboard bore a hole in the
ship and let in the waves for you know we always
compare the devil to the deep seas
pr'ythee peace wildrake said everard
and let him on with his history well and
what saw'st thou when the door was opened 
the great devil with his horns and claws thou
wilt say no doubt
 no sir i will say nothing but what is true 
when i undid the door one man stood there
and he to seeming a man no extraordinary
 woodstock
appearance he was wrapped in a taffeta cloak
 a scarlet colour and with a red lining he
seemed as if he might have been in his time a
very handsome man but there was something 
paleness and sorrow in his face a long lovelock
and long hair he wore even after the abomination
 the cavaliers and the unloveliness as
learned master prynne well termed it lovelocks
 a jewel in his ear a blue scarf over his
shoulder like a military commander for the king
and a hat with a white plume bearing a peculiar
hatband
some unhappy officer cavaliers whom
so many are in hiding and seeking shelter through
the country briefly replied everard
true worthy sir right as a judicious exposition
but there was something about this
man if he was a man whom i for one could
not look upon without trembling nor the musketeers
who were in the hall without betraying
much alarm and swallowing as they themselves
swill aver the very bullets which they had in
their mouths for loading their carabines and muskets
nay the wolf and deerdogs that are
woodstock 
the fiercest their kind fled from this visitor
and crept into holes and corners moaning and
wailing in a low and broken tone he came
into the middle the hall and still he seemed
no more than an ordinary man only somewhat
fantastically dressed in a doublet black velvet
pinked upon scarlet satin under his cloak a jewel
in his ear with large roses in his shoes and a
kerchief in his hand which he sometimes pressed
against his left side
gracious heaven said wildrake coming
close up to everard and whispering in his ear
with accents which terror rendered tremulous a
mood mind most unusual to the daring man
who seemed now overcome by it it must have
been poor dick robinson the player in the very
dress in which i have seen him play pilaster 
ay and drank a jolly bottle with him after it at
the mermaid i remember how many frolicks
we had together and all his little fantastic fashions
he served for his old master charles
in mohun's troop and was murdered by this
butcher's dog as i have heard after surrender
at the battle nasebyfield
 woodstock
hush i have heard the deed said everard
 for god's sake hear the man to an 
did this visitor speak to thee my friend 
yes sir in a pleasing tone voice but
somewhat fanciful in the articulation and like
one who is speaking to an audience as from a
bar or a pulpit more than in the voice ordinary
men on ordinary matters he desired to
see majorgeneral harrison
he did and you said everard infected
by the spirit the time which as is well known
leaned to credulity upon all matters supernatural
agency what did you do 
i went up to the parlour and related that
such a person inquired for him he started when
i told him and eagerly desired to know the
man's dress but no sooner did i mention his
dress and the jewel in his ear than he said
begone tell him i will not admit him to speech
 me say that i defy him and will make my
defiance good at the great battle in the valley 
armageddon when the voice the angel shall
call all fowls which fly under the face heaven
to feed on the flesh the captain and the soils

woodstock
tier the warhorse and his rider say to the
evil one i have power to appeal our conflict
even till that day and that in the front that
fearful day he will again meet with harrison
i went back with this answer to the stranger
and his face was writhed into such a deadly
frown as a mere human brow hath seldom worn
return to him he said and say it is my
hour and that if he come not instantly down to
speak with me i will mount the stairs to him
say that i command him to descend by the token
that on the field naseby he did not the
work negligently 
 i have heard whispered wildrake who
felt more and more strongly the contagion superstition
 that these words were blasphemously
used by harrison when he shot my poor
friend dick
what happened next said everard see
that thou speaks the truth
as gospel expounded by a steepleman
said the independent yet truly it is but little
i have to say i saw my master come down
with a blank yet resolved air and when he entered
the hall and saw the stranger he made a
 woodstock
pause the other waved on him as if to follow
and walked out at the portal my worthy patron
seemed as if he were about to follow yet
again paused when this visitant be he man or
fiend reentered and said obey thy doom
by pathless march by greenwood tree
it is thy weird to follow me 
to follow me through the ghastly moonlight 
to follow me through the shadows night 
to follow me comrade still art thou bound 
i conjure thee by the untouched wound
i conjure thee by the last words i spoke
when the body slept and the spirit awoke
in the very last pangs the deadly stroke
so saying he stalked out and my master followed
him into the wood i followed also at a
distance but when i came up my master was
alone and bearing himself as you now behold
him
thou hast had a wonderful memory friend
said the colonel coldly to remember these
rhymes in a single recitation there seems something
 practice in all this
a single recitation my honoured sir exclaimed
the independent alack the rhyme is
seldom out my poor master's mouth when as
sometimes laps he is less triumphant in his
woodstock 
wrestles with satan but it was the first time 
ever heard it uttered by another and to say
truth he ever seems to repeat it unwillingly as a
child after his pedagogue and as it was not indited
by his own head as the psalmist saith
it is strange said everard i have heard
and read that the spirits the slaughtered have
strange power over the slayer but i am astonished
to believe there may be truth in such tales
roger wildrake what art thou afraid 
man why dost thou shift thy place thus 
fear it is not fear it is hate deadly hate
i see the murderer poor dick before me
and see he throws himself into a posture fence
sa sa say'st thou brood a butcher's mastiffs
thou shalt not want an antagonist
ere any one could stop him wildrake threw
aside his cloak drew his sword and almost with
a single bound cleared the distance betwixt him
and harrison and crossed swords with the latter
as he stood brandishing his weapon as if in
immediate expectation an assailant accordingly
the republican general was not for an
instant taken at unawares but the moment the
swords clashed he shouted ha i feel thee
 woodstock
now thou hast come in body at last welcome 
welcome the sword the lord and gideon

 part them part them cried everard as he
and tom king at first astonished at the suddenness
 the affray hastened to interfere everard
seizing on the cavalier drew him forcibly backwards
while tomkins contrived with risk and
difficulty to master harrison's sword while the
general exclaimed ha two to one two to
one thus fight demons wildrakeon his side
swore a dreadful oath and added markham
you have cancelled every obligation i owed you 
they are all out sight gone d n me
 you have indeed acquitted these obligations
rarely said everard who knows how this
affair shall be explained and answered 
i will answer it with my ife said wildrake

good now be silent said tomkins and
let me manage it shall be so ordered that the
good general shall never know that he hath encountered
with a mortal man only let that man
 moab put his sword into the scabbard's rest
and be still
woodstock 
wildrake let me entreat thee to sheathe thy
sword said everard else on my life thou
must turn it against me
no fore george not so mad as that neither
but i'll have another day with him
 thou another day exclaimed harrison
whose eye had still remained fixed on the spot
where he found such palpable resistance yes
i know thee well day by day week by week
thou makes the same idle request for thou
knowest that my heart quivers at thy voice 
but my hand trembles not when opposed to thine
the spirit is willing to the combat if the flesh
be weak when opposed to that which is not 
the flesh
now peace all for heaven's sake said
the steward tomkins then added addressing
his master there is no one here if it please
your excellence but tomkins and the worthy
colonel everard
general harrison as sometimes happens in
cases partial insanity that is supposing his
to have been a case mental delusion though
vol d
 woodstock
firmly and entirely persuaded the truth his
own visions yet was not willing to speak on the
subject to those who he knew would regard them
as imaginary upon this occasion he assumed
the appearance perfect ease and composure
after the violent agitation he had just manifested
in a manner which showed how anxious he was to
disguise his real feelings from everard whom he
considered as unlikely to participate them
he saluted the colonel with profound ceremony
and talked the fineness the evening
which had summoned him forth the lodge to
take a turn in the park and enjoy the favourable
weather he then took everard by the arm and
walked back with him towards the lodge wildrake
and tomkins following close behind and
leading the horses everard desirous to gain
some light on these mysterious incidents endeavoured
to come on the subject more than once by
a mode interrogation which harrison for madmen
are very often unwilling to enter on the subject
 their mental delusion parried with some
skill or addressed himself for aid to his steward
tomkins who was in the habit seeing voucher
woodstock 
for his master upon all occasions which led to
desirous's ingenious nickname gibbet
and wherefore had you your sword drawn
my worthy general said everard when you
were only on an evening walk pleasure 
truly excellent colonel these are times
when men must watch with their loins girded
and their lights burning and their weapons
drawn the day draweth nigh believe me or not
as you will that men must watch lest they be
found naked and unarmed when the seven trumpets
shall sound boot and saddle and the pipes
 jeer shall strike up horse and away
 true good general but methought i saw
you making passes even now as if you were fighting
said everard
i am a strange fantasy friend everard
answered harrison and when i walk alone
and happen as but now to have my weapon
drawn i sometimes for exercise sake will practise
a thrust against such a tree as that it is a
silly pride men have in the use weapons i
have been accounted a master fence and have
fought prizes when i was unregenerate and
 woodstock
before i was called to do my part in the great
work entering as a trooper into our victorious
general's first regiment horse
but methought said everard i heard a
weapon clash with yours 
how a weapon clash with my sword 
how could that be tomkins 
truly sir said tomkins it must have
been a bough the tree they have them all
kinds here and your honour may have pushed
against one them which the brazilians call
ironwood a block which being struck with a
hammer saith purchas in his pilgrimage ringeth
like an anvil
 truly it may be so said harrison for
these rulers who are gone assembled in this their
abode pleasure many strange trees and plants
though they gathered not the fruit that
tree which beareth twelve manner fruits or
 those leaves which are the healing the nations

everard pursued his investigation for he was
struck with the manner in which harrison evaded
his questions and the dexterity with which
woodstock 
lie threw his transcendental and fanatical notions
like a sort veil over the darker visions excited
by remorse and conscious guilt
but said he if i may trust my eyes and
ears i cannot but still think that you had a real
antagonist nay i am sure i saw a fellow in a
darkcoloured jerkin retreat through the wood
did you said harrison with a tone 
surprise while his voice faltered in spite him
who could he be tomkins did you see the
fellow colonel everard talks with the napkin
in his hand the bloody napkin which he always
pressed to his side 
this last expression in which harrison gave
a mark different from that which everard had
assigned but corresponding to tomkins's original
description the supposed spectre had more
effect on everard in confirming the steward's
story than anything he had witnessed or heard
the voucher answered the draft upon him as
promptly as usual that he had seen such a fellow
glide past them into the thicket that he daresay
he was some deerstealer for he had heard they
were become very audacious
 woodstock
look ye there now master everard said
harrison hurrying from the subject is it not
time now that we should lay aside our controversies
and join hand in hand to repairing the
breaches our zion happy and contented
were i my excellent friend to be a reader 
mortar or a bearer a hod upon this occasion
under our great leader with whom providence
has gone forth in this great national controversy 
and truly so devoutly do i hold by our excellent
and victorious general oliver whom heaven
long preserve that were he to command me i
should not scruple to pluck forth his high
place the man whom they call speaker even as
i lent a poor hand to pluck down the man whom
they called king wherefore as i know your
judgment holdeth with mine on this matter let
rae urge unto you lovingly that we may act as brethren
and build up the breaches and reestablish
the bulwarks our english zion whereby we
shall be doubtless chosen as pillars and buttresses
under our excellent lord general for supporting
and sustaining the same and endowed with
proper revenues and incomes both spiritual and
moodstotx 
temporal to serve as a pedestal on which we
may stand seeing that otherwise our foundation
will be on the loose sand nevertheless continued
he his mind again diverging from his
views temporal ambition into his visions 
the fifth monarchy these things are but vanity
in respect the opening the which
is sealed for all things approach speedily towards
lightning and thundering and unloosing the
great dragon from the bottomless pit wherein he
is chained
with this mingled strain earthly politics
and fanatical prediction harrison so overpowered
colonel everard as to leave him no time to urge
lira further on the particular circumstances 
his nocturnal skirmish concerning which it is
plain he had no desire to be interrogated they
now reached the lodge woodstock
 woodstock
chapter iii
now the wasted brands do glow
while the screechowl sounding loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance a shroud
now it is the time night
that the graves all gaping wide
livery one lets out its sprite
in the churchway paths to glide
midsummer night's dream
before the gate the palace the guards were
now doubled everard demanded the reason 
this from the corporal whom he found in the hall
with his soldiers sitting or sleeping around a great
fire maintained at the expense the carved
chairs and benches with fragments which it
was furnished
why verily answered the man the corps
de garde as your worship says will be harassed
to pieces by such dujy nevertheless fear hath
woodstock 
gone abroad among us and no one man will
mount guard alone we have drawn in however
one or two our outposts from banbury
and elsewhere and we are to have a relief from
oxford tomorrow
everard continued minute inquiries concerning
the sentinels that were posted within as
well as without the castle and found that as
they had been stationed under the eye harrison
himself the rules prudent discipline had
been exactly observed in the distribution the
posts there remained nothing therefore for colonel
everard to do excepting that remembering
his own adventure the evening to recommend
that an additional sentinel should be placed with
a companion if judged indispensable in that vestibule
or antiroom from which the long gallery
where he had met with the rencounter and other
suites apartments diverged the corporal respectfully
promised all obedience to his orders
the servingmen being called appeared also in
double force everard demanded to know whether
the commissioners had gone to bed or whether
he could get speech with them 
f they are in their bedroom forsooth replied
 woodstock
one the fellows but i think be not yet undressed

what said everard are colonel desborough
and master bletson both in the same
sleeping apartment 
their honours have so chosen it said the
man and their honours secretaries remain
upon guard all night
it is the fashion to double guards all over
the house said wildrake had i a glimpse 
a goodlooking housemaid now i should know
how to fall into the fashion
peace fool said everard and where
are the mayor and master holdenough 
the mayor is returned to the borough on
horseback behind the trooper who goes to oxford
for the reinforcement and the man the
steeplehouse hath quartered himself in the chamber
which colonel desborough had last night
being that in which he is most likely to meet the
your honour understands the lord pity
us we are a harassed family 
and where be general harrison's knaves
said tomkins that they do not marshal him
to his apartment 
woodstock 
here here here master tompkins said
three fellows pressing forward with the same consternation
on their faces which seemed to pervade
the whole inhabitants woodstock
away with you then said tomkins 
speak not to his worship you see he is not in
the humour
indeed observed colonel everard he
looks singularly wan his features seem writhen
as by a palsy stroke and though he was talking
so fast while we came along he hath not opened
this mouth since we came to the light
it is his manner after such visitations said
tomkins give his honour your arms zedekiah
and jonathan to lead him off i will follow
instantly you nicodemus tarry to wait upon
me it is not well walking alone in this mansion
master tomkins said everard i have
heard you often as a sharp intelligent man 
tell me fairly are you in earnest afraid anything
supernatural haunting this house 
i would be loath to run the chance sir said
tomkins very gravely by looking on my worshipful
master you may form a guess how the
living look after llicy have spoken with the dead
 woodstock
he bowed low and took his leave everard
proceeded to the chamber which the two remaining
commissioners had for comfort's sake chosen
to inhabit in company they were preparing
for bed as he went into their apartment both
started as the door opened both rejoiced when
they saw it was only everard who entered
hark ye hither said bletson pulling him
aside safest thou ever ass equal to lesbos
 the fellow is as big as an ox and as
timorous as a sheep he has insisted on my
sleeping here to protect him shall we have a
merry night on't ha we will if thou wilt take
the third bed which was prepared for harrison 
but he is gone out like a mooncalf to look for
the valley armageddon in the park woodstock

general harrison has returned with me but
now said everard
nay but as i shall live he comes not into
our apartment said desborough overhearing
his answer no man that has been supping
for aught i know with the devil has a right to
sleep among christian folks
woodstock t
 he does not propose so said everard 
he sleeps as i understand apart and alone
not quite alone i dare say said lesbos
 for harrison hath a sort attraction
for goblins they fly round him like moths about
a candle but i prithee good everard do thou
stay with us i know not how it is but although
thou hast not thy religion always in thy mouth
nor speaks many hard words about it like harrison
 nor makes long preachments like a certain
most honourable relation mine who shall
be nameless yet somehow i feel myself safer in
thy company than with any them as for
this bletson he is such a mere blasphemer that
i fear the devil will carry him away ere morning

did you ever hear such a paltry coward 
said bletson apart to everard do tarry
however mine honoured colonel i know your
zeal to assist the distressed and you see desborough
is in that predicament that he will
require near him more than one good example to
prevent him thinking ghosts and fiends
 i am sorry i cannot oblige you gentleman's
said everard but i have settled my mind w
gti woodstock
sleep in victor lee's apartment so i wish you
good night and if you would repose without
disturbance i would advise that you commend
yourselves during the watches the night to
him unto whom night is even as midday i
had intended to have spoke with you this evening
on the subject my being here but i will
defer the conference till tomorrow when i
think i will be able to show you excellent reasons
for leaving woodstock
we have seen plenty such already said
desborough for one i came here to serve the
estate with some moderate advantage doubtless
to myself for my trouble but if i am set upon
my head again tonight as i was the night before
i would not stay longer to gain a king's crown
for i am sure my neck would be unfitted to bear
the weight it
good night exclaimed everard and was
about to go when bletson again pressed close
and whispered to him hark thee colonel you
know my friendship for thee i do implore thee
to leave the door thy apartment open that if
thou meekest with any disturbance i may hear
thee call and be with thee upon the very instant
woodstock 
do this dear everard my fears for thee will
keep me awake else for i know that notwithstanding
your excellent sense you entertain some
 those superstitious ideas which we suck in
with our mother's milk and which constitute the
ground our fears in situations like the present 
therefore leave thy door open if you love me that
you may have ready assistance from me in case
 need
my masters said wildrake trusts first
in his bible sir and then in his good sword
he has no idea that the devil can be baffled by
the charm two men lying in one room still
less that the foul fiend can be argued out existence
by the nuuifidians the rota
everard seized his imprudent friend by the
collar and dragged him off as he was speaking
keeping fast hold him till they were both in
the chamber victor lee where they had slept
on a former occasion even then he continued
to hold wildrake until the servant had arranged
the lights and was dismissed from the room 
then letting him go addressed him with the upbraiding
question art thou not a prudent and
 woodstock
sagacious person who in times like these seek
every opportunity to argue yourself into a broil
or embroil yourself in an argument out on
you 
ay out on me indeed said the cavalier 
out on me for a poor tamespirited creature j
that submits to be bandied about in this manners
by a man who is neither better born nor better
bred than myself i tell thee mark you
make an unfair use your advantages over me
why will you not let me go from you and live
and die after my own fashion 
because before we had been a week separate
i should hear your dying after the fashion
 a dog come my good friend what
madness was it in thee to fall foul on harrison
and then to enter into useless argument with
bletson 
why we are in the devil's house i think
and i would willingly give the landlord his due
wherever i travel to have sent him harrison
or bletson now just as a lunch to stop his appetite
till from 
hush stone walls have ears said everard
woodstock 
looking around him here stands thy nightdrink
look to thy arms for we must be as careful
as if the avenger blood were behind us
yonder is thy bed and i as thou seest have
one prepared in the parlour the door only
divides us
which i will leave open in case thou should'st
hollo for assistance as yonder nuuifidian hath
it but how hast thou got all this so well put in
order good patron f
i gave the steward tomkins notice ray
purpose to sleep here
a strange fellow that said wildrake and
as i judge has taken measure every one's
foot all seems to pass through his hands
 he is i have understood replied everard
one the men formed by the times has a
ready gift preaching and expounding which
keeps him in high terms with the independents 
and recommends himself to the more moderate
people by his intelligence and activity
has his sincerity ever been doubted said
wildrake
never that i heard said io colonel 
vol k
 woodstock
on the contrary he has been familiarly called
honest joe and trusty tomkins for my part
i believe his sincerity has always kept pace with
his interest but come finish thy cup and to
bed what all emptied at one draught 
 adszookers yes my vow forbids me to
make two on't but never fear the nightcap
will only warm my brain not clog it so manor
devil give me notice if you are disturbed and
rely on me in a twinkling so saying the cavalier
retreated into his separate apartment and
colonel everard taking off the most cumbrous
part his dress lay down in his hose and doublet
and composed himself to rest
he was awakened from sleep by a slow and
solemn strain music which died away as at a
distance he started up and felt for his arms
which he found close beside him his temporary
bed being without curtains he could look
around him without difficulty but as there remained
in the chimney only a few red embers 
the fire which he had arranged before he went to
sleep it was impossible he could discern anything
he felt therefore in spite his natural
courage that undefined and thrilling species 
woodstock 
tremor which attends a sense that danger is near
and an uncertainty concerning its cause and character
reluctant as hews to yield belief to supernatural
occurrences we have already said he was
not absolutely incredulous as perhaps even in
this more sceptical age there are many fewer
complete and absolute infidels on this particular
than give themselves out for such uncertain
whether he had not dreamed these sounds
which seemed yet in his ears he was unwilling
to risk the raillery his friend by summoning
him to his assistance he sat up therefore in
his bed not without experiencing that nervous
agitation to which brave men as well as cowards are
subject with this difference that the one sinks
under it like the vine under the hailstorm and
the other collects his energies to shake it off as
the cedar lebanon is said to elevate its boughs
to disperse the snow which accumulates upon
them
the story harrison in his own absolute
despite and notwithstanding a secret suspicion
which he had trick or connivance returned on
his mind at this dead and solitary hour harrison
he remembered had described the vision
g woonstoik
iy a circumstance its appearance different from
that which his own remark had been calculated
to suggest to the mind the visionary that
bloody napkin always pressed to the side was
then a circumstance present either to his bodily
eye or to that his agitated imagination did
then the murdered revisit the living haunts
 those who had forced them from the stage
with all their sins unaccounted for and if they
did might not the same permission authorize
other visitations a similar nature to warn to
instruct to punish rash are they was his conclusion
and credulous who receive as truth every
tale the kind but no less rash may it be to
limit the power the creator over the works
which he has made and to suppose that by the
permission the author nature the laws 
nature may not in peculiar cases and for high
purposes be temporarily suspended
while these thoughts passed through everard's
mind feelings unknown to him even when
he stood first on the rough and perilous edge 
battle gained ground upon him he feared he
knew not what and where an open and discernible
peril would have drawn out his courage the
woods k 
absolute uncertainty his situation increased
his sense the danger he felt an almost irresistible
desire to spring from his bed and heap
fuel on the dying embers expecting by the blaze
to see some strange sight in his chamber he
was also strongly templed to awaken wildrake 
but shame stronger than fear itself checked
these impulses what should it be thought
that markham everard held one the best soldiers
who had drawn a sword in this sad war 
markham everard who had obtained such distinguished
rank in the army the parliament
though so young in years was afraid remaining
by himself in a twilightroom at midnight
it never should be said
this was however no charm for his unpleasant
current thought there rushed on his
mind the various traditions victor lee's chamber
which though he had often despised them
as vague unauthenticated and inconsistent rumours
engendered by ancient superstition and
transmitted from generation to generation by
loquacious rrcduhty had yet something in them
which did not tend to allay the present imo
woodstock
pleasant state his nerves then when he
recollected the events that very afternoon
the weapon pressed against his throat and the
strong arm which threw him backward on the
floor if the remembrance served to contradict
the idea flitting phantoms and unreal daggers
it certainly induced him to believe that
there was in some part this extensive mansion
a party cavaliers or malignant harboured
who might arise in the night overpower the
guards and execute upon them all but on harrison
in particular as one the regicide judges
that vengeance which was so eagerly thirsted forby
the attached followers the slaughtered monarch

he endeavoured to console himself on this
subject by the number and position the
guards yet still was dissatisfied with himself for
not having taken yet more exact precautions and
for keeping an extorted promise silence which
might consign so many his party to the danger
 assassination these thoughts connected
with his military duties awakened another train
 reflections he bethought himself that all he
woodstock 
could now do was to visit the sentries and ascertain
that they were awake alert on the watch
and so situated that in time need they might
be ready to support each other this better
befits me he thought than to be here like a
child frightening myself with the old woman's
legend which i have laughed at when a boy
what if old victor lee was a sacrilegious man
as common report goes and brewed ale in the
font which he brought from the ancient palace 
holyrood while church and building were inflames
 and what if his eldest son was when a
child scalded to death in the same vessel how
many churches have been demolished since his
time how many fonts desecrated so many
indeed that were the vengeance heaven to
visit such aggressions in a supernatural manner
no corner in england no not the most petty
parish church but would have its apparition 
tush these are idle fancies unworthy especially
to be entertained by those educated to believe
that sanctity resides in the intention and the act
not in the buildings or fonts or the form worship

 woodstock
as thus he called together the articles his
calvinistic creed the bell the great clock a
token seldom silent in such narratives tolled three
and was immediately followed by the hoarse call
 the sentinels through vault and gallery upstairs
and beneath challenging and answering
each other with the usual watchword all's well
their voices mingled with the deep boom the
bell yet ceased before that was silent and when
they had died away the tingling echo the prolonged
knell was scarcely audible ere yet that
last distant tingling had finally subsided into silence
it seemed as if it again was awakened and
everard could hardly judge at first whether a new
echo had taken up the falling cadence or whether
some other and separate sound was disturbing
anew the silence to which the deep knell had as
its voice ceased consigned the ancient mansion
and the woods around it
but the doubt was soon cleared up the musical
tones which had mingled with the dying
echoes the knell seemed at first to prolong
and afterwards to survive them a wild strain
 melody beginning at a distance and growwoodstock

ing louder as it advanced seemed to pass from
room to room from cabinet to gallery from
hall to bower through the deserted and dishonoured
ruins the ancient residence so many
sovereigns and as it approached no soldier gave
alarm nor did any the numerous guests various
degrees who spent an unpleasant and terrified
night in that ancient mansion seem to dare to
announce to each other the inexplicable cause 
apprehension
everard's excited state mind did not permit
him to be so passive the sounds approached so
nigh that it seemed they were performing in the
very next apartment a solemn service for the dead
when he gave the alarm by calling loudly to his
trusty attendant and friend wildrake who slumbered
in tht next chamber with only a door betwixt
them and even that ajar
wildrake wildrake up up dost thou
not hear the alarm 
there was no answer from wildrake though
the musical sounds which now rung through the
apartment as if the performers had actually been
within its precincts would have been sufficient to
 woodstock
awaken a sleeping person even without the shout
 his comrade and patron
alarm roger wildrake arm again
called everard getting out bed and graspinghis
weapons get a light and cry alarm
there was no answer his voice died away as
the sound the music seemed also to die and
the same soft sweet voice which still to his thinking
resembled that alice lee was heard in his
apartment and as he thought at no distance from
him
your comrade will not answer said the low
soft voice those only hear the alarm whose
consciences feel the call
again this mummery said edward i
am better armed than i was late and but for
the sound that voice the speaker had bought
his trifling dear
it was singular we may observe in passing that
the instant the distinct sounds the human voice
were heard by everard all idea supernatural
interference was at an and the charm by
which he had been formerly fettered appeared to
be broken so much is the influence imaginary
woodblock 
or superstitious terror dependant so far as respects
strong judgments at least upon what is
vague or ambiguous and so readily do distinct
tones and express ideas bring such judgments
back to the current ordinary life the voice returned
answer as addressing his thoughts as well
as his words
 we laugh at the weapons thou thickest
should terrify us over the guardians woodstock
they have no power fire if thou wilt
and try the effect thy weapons but know
it is not our purpose to harm thee thou art a
falcon breed and noble in thy disposition though
unreclaimed and ill nurtured thou haunted with
kites and carrion crows wing thy flight from
hence on the morrow for if thou tarriest with
the bats owls vultures and ravens which have
thought to nestle here thou wilt inevitably share
their fate away then that these halls may be
swept and garnished for reception those who
have a better right to inhabit them
everard answered in a raised voice once
more i warn you think not to defy me in vain i
am no child to be frightened by goblins tales and
 woodstock
no coward armed as i am to be alarmed at the
threats banditti if i give you a moment's indulgence
it is for the sake dear and misguided
friends who may be concerned with this dangerous
gambol know i can bring a troop soldiers
round the castle who will search its most inward
recesses for the author this audacious frolic 
and if that search should fail it will cost but a
few barrels gunpowder to make the mansion a
heap ruins and bury under them the authors 
such an illjudged pastime
you speak proudly sir colonel said another
voice similar to that harsher and stronger
tone by which he had been addressed in the gallery
 try your courage in this direction
you should not dare me twice said colonel
everard had i a glimpse light to take aim
by
as he spoke a sudden gleam light was
thrown with a brilliancy which almost dazzled
the speaker showing distinctly a form somewhat
resembling that victor lee as represented
in his picture holding in the one hand a
lady completely veiled and in the other his leadwoodstock

kingstaff or truncheon both figures were animated
and as it appeared standing within six
feet him
were it not for the woman said everard
i would not be thus mortally dared
spare not for the female form but do your
worst replied the same voice i defy you
repeat your defiance when i have counted
thrice said everard and take the punishment
 your insolence once i have cocked my pistol
 twice i never missed my aim by all that
is sacred i fire if you do not withdraw when
i pronounce the next number i will shoot you
dead where you stand i am yet unwilling to shed
blood i give you another chance flight once
twice thrice
everard aimed at the bosom and discharged his
pistol the figure waved its arm in an attitude 
scorn and a loud laugh arose during which the
light as gradually growing weaker danced and
glimmered upon the apparition the aged knight
and then disappeared everard's lifeblood ran
cold to his heart had he been human mould
 woodstock
ie thought the bullet must have pierce him
and i have neither will nor power to fight with
supernaturalal beings
the feeling oppression was now so strong as
to be actually sickening he groped his way
however to the fireside and flung on the embers
which were yet gleaming a handful dry fuel
it presently blazed and afforded him light to seethe
room in every direction he looked cautiously
almost timidly around and half expected
some horrible phantom to become visible but he
saw nothing save the old furniture the 
and other articles which had been left
in the same state as when sir henry lee departed
he felt an uncontrollable desire mingled
with much repugnance to look at the portrait 
the ancient knight which the form he had seen
so strongly resembled he hesitated betwixt the
opposing feelings but at length snatched with desperate
resolution the taper which he had extinguished
and relighted it ere the blaze the fuel
had again died away he held it up to the ancient
portrait victor lee and gazed on it
with eager curiosity not unmingled with fear
woodstock 
almost the childish terrors his earlier days returned
and he thought the severe pale eye the
ancient warrior followed his and menaced him
with its displeasure and although he quickly
argued himself out such an absurd belief yet
the mixed feelings his mind were expressed in
words that seemed half addressed to the ancient
portrait
soul my mother's ancestor he said be
it for weal or for woe by designing men or by
supernatural beings that these ancient halls are
disturbed i am resolved to leave them on the
morrow
i rejoice to hear it with all my soul said a
voice behind him
he turned saw a tall figure in white with a
sort turban upon its head and dropping the
candle in the exertion instantly grappled with it
thou at least art palpable he said
palpable answered he whom he grasped so
strongly sdeath methinks you might know
that without the risk choking me and if you
loose me not i'll show you that two can play at
the game wrestling
 woodstock
roger wiklrakc said everard letting the
cavalier loose and stepping back
 roger wildrake ay truly did you take
me for roger bacon come to help you to raise
the devil for the place smells sulphur consumedly

it is the pistol i fired did you not hear
it
why yes it was the first thing waked me 
for that night cap which i pulled on made me
sleep like a dormouse pshaw i feel my brains
giddy with it yet
and wherefore came you not on the instant 
i never needed help more
i came as fast as i could answered wildrake
 but it was some time ere i got my senses
collected for i was dreaming that cursed field
at naseby and then the door my room was
shut and hard to open till i played the locksmith
with my foote
how it was open when i went to bed said
everard
 it was locked when i came out bed though
is
woodstock 
said wildrake and i marvel you heard me not
when i forced it opens
my mind was occupied otherwise said everard

well said wildrake but what has happened
 here am i bolt upright and ready to
fight if this yawning fit will give me leave mother
redcap's mightiest is weaker than i drank
last night by a bushel to a barleycorn i have
quaffed the very elixir malt ha yaw
and some opiate besides i should think
said everard
very like very like less than the pistolshot
would not waken me even me who with but
an ordinary gracecup sleep as lightly as a maiden
on the first may when she watches for the
earliest beam to go to gather dew but what are
you about to do next 
nothing answered everard
nothing said wildrake in surprise
i speak it said colonel everard less for
your information than for that others who may
hear me that i will leave the lodge this mornvol
 f
 woodstock
ing and if it is possible remove the commissioners

 hark said wildrake do you not hear
some noise hke the distant sound the applause
 a theatre the goblins the place rejoice in
your departure
i shall leave woodstock said everard to
the occupation my uncle sir henry lee and
his family if they choose to resume it not that
i am frightened into this as a concession to the
series artifices which have been played off on
this occasion but solely because such was my intention
from the beginning but let me warn he
added raising his voices let me warn the parties
concerned in this combination that though it
may pass off successfully on a fool like lesbos
a visionary like harrison a coward like
bletson 
here a voice distinctly spoke as standing near
them or a wise moderate and resolute person
like colonel everard
by heaven the voice came from the picture
said wildrake drawing his sword i will pink
his plaited armour for him
woodstock s
ojfter no violence said everard startled at
the interruption but resuming with firmness what
he was saying let those engaged be aware that
however this string artifices may be immediately
successful it must when closely looked into be
attended with the punishment all concerned 
the total demolition woodstock and the irremediable
downfall the family lee let all
concerned think this and desist in time
he paused and almost expected a reply but
none came
it is a very odd thing said wildrakc but
yawha my brain cannot compass it just now 
it whirls round like a toast in a bowl muscadine
 i must sit down hewyaw and discuss it
at leisure gramercy good elbowchair
so saying he threw himself or rather sank
gradually down on a large easy chair which had
been often pressed by the weight stout sir
henry lee and in an instant was sound asleep
everard was far from feeling the same inclination
for slumber yet his mind was relieved the apprehension
 any farther visitation that night 
for he considered his treaty to evacuate woods
woodstock
stock as made known to and accepted in all probability
by those whom the intrusion the commissioners
had induced to take such singular measures
for expelling them his opinion which had
for a time bent towards a belief in something supernatural
in the disturbances had now returned
to the more rational mode accounting for them
by dexterous combination for which such a mansion
as woodstock afforded so many facilities
he heaped the hearth with fuel lighted the
candle and examining poor wildrake's situation
adjusted him as easily in the chair as he could the
cavalier stirring his limbs no more than an infant
his situation went far in his patron's opinion to
infer trick and confederacy for ghosts have no occasion
to drug men's possets he threw himself on
the bed and while he thought these strange circumstances
over a sweet and low strain music stole
through the chamber the words good night 
good night good night thrice repeated each
time in a softer and more distant tone seeming to
assure him that the goblins and he were at truce
if not at peace and that he had no more disturbance
to expect that night he had scarcely the courage
woodstock 
to call out a good night for after all his conviction
 the existence a trick it was so well performed
as to bring with it a feeling fear just like
what an audience feel during the performance 
a tragic scene which they know to be unreal and
which yet affects their passions by its near approach
to nature sleep overtook him at last and
left him not till broad daylight on the ensuing
morning
 woodstock
chapter 
ami yonder shines aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
troop home to churchyard
midsummer's nights drcatn
with the fresh air and the rising morning
every feeling the preceding night had passed
away from colonel everard's mind excepting wonder
how the effects which he had witnessed could be
produced he examined the whole room sounding
bolt floor and wainscot with his knuckles
and cane but was unable to discern any secret
passages while the door secured by a strong cross
bolt and the lock besides remained as firm as when
he had fastened it on the preceding evening the
apparition resembling victor lee next called his
attention ridiculous stories had been often cir
woodstock 
related this figure or one exactly resembling
it having been met with by night among the
waste apartments and corridors the old palace 
and markham everard had often heard such in
his childhood he was angry to recollect his own
deficiency courage and the thrill which he felt
on the preceding night when by confederacy
doubtless such an object was placed before his
eyes
surely he said this fit childish folly
could not make me miss my aim more likely
that the bullet had been withdrawn clandestinely
from my pistol
he examined that which was undischarged he
found the bullet in it he investigated the apartment
opposite to the point at which he had fired
and at five feet from the door in a direct line between
the bedside and the place where the appearances
had been seen a pistolball had recently
buried itself in the wainscot he had little doubt
therefore that he had fired in a just direction 
and indeed to have arrived at the place where it
was lodged the bullet must have passed through
 woodstock
the appearance at which he aimed and proceeded
point blank to the wall beyond this was mysterious
and induced him to doubt whether the art 
witchcraft or conjuration had not been called in to
assist the machinations those daring conspirators
who being themselves mortal might nevertheless
according to the universal creed the
times have invoked and obtained assistance from
the inhabitants another world
his next investigation respected the picture 
victor lee itself he examined it minutely as he
stood on the floor before it and compared its pale
shadowy faintlytraced outlines its faded colours
the stern repose the eye and deathlike pallidness
 the countenance with its different aspect on
the preceding night when illuminated by the artificial
light which fell full upon it while it left
every other part the room in comparative darkness
the features seemed then to have an unnatural
glow while the rising and falling the flame in
the chimney gave the head and limbs something
which resembled the appearance actual motion
now seen by day it was a mere picture the
woodstock 
hard and ancient school holbein formerly it
seemed for the moment something more determined
to get to the bottom this contrivance if
possible everard by the assistance a table and
chair examined the portrait still more closely and
endeavoured to ascertain the existence any private
spring by which it might be slipt aside a
contrivance not unfrequent in ancient buildings
which usually abounded with means access and
escape communicated to none but the lords the
castle or their immediate confidents but the
panel on which victor lee was painted was
firmly fixed in the wainscoting the apartment
 which it made a part and the colonel satisfied
himself that it could not hav been used for the
purpose which he had suspected
he next aroused his faithful squire wildrake
who notwithstanding his deep share the blessedness
 sleep had scarce even yet got rid 
the effects the gracecup the preceding evening
 it was the reward according to his own
view the matter his temperance one
single draught having made him sleep more late
and more sound than a matter halfadozen or
 woodstock
from thence to a dozen pulls would have done
when he was guilty the enormity reresup
pers and drinking deep after them
had your temperate draught said everard
 been but a thought more strongly seasoned
wildrake thou hadst slept so sound that the last
trump only could have waked thee
and then answered wildrake i should
have waked with a headache mark for i see my
modest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue
 but let us go forth and see how the night
which we have passed so strangely has been spent
by the rest them i suspect they are all right
willing to evacuate woodstock unless they have
cither rested better than we or at least been more
lucky in lodgings
in that case i will dispatch thee down to
joceline's hut to negotiate the reentrance sh
weresuppers quasi arrive belonged to a species luxury
introduced in the jolly days king james's extravagance and
continued through the subsequent reign the supper took place
at an early hour six or seven o'clock at latest the weresupper
was a preliminary banquet a hors d'auvrc which made its appearance
at ten or eleven and served as an apology for prolonging
the entertainment till midnight
woodstock 
henry lee and his family into their old apartments
where my interest with the general being
joined with the indifferent repute the place
itself i think they have little chance being disturbed
either by the present or by any new commissioners

but how are they to defend themselves
against the fiends my gallant colonel said
wildrake methinks had i an interest in
yonder pretty girl such as thou dost boast i
should be loath to expose her to the terrors a
residence at woodstock where these devils i
beg their pardon for i suppose they hear every
word we sly these merry goblins make such
gay work from twilight till morning
my dear wildrake said the colonel i
as well as you believe it possible that our speech
may be overheard but i care not and will speak
my mind plainly i trust sir henry and alice
are not engaged in this silly plot i cannot reconcile
it with the pride the one the modesty
 the other or the good sense both that any
motive could engage them in so strange a conjunction
but the fiends arc all your own political
 woodstock
persuasion wildrake all trueblue cavaliers and
i am convinced that sir henry and alice lee
though they be unconnected with them have not
the slightest cause to be apprehensive their
goblin machinations besides sir henry and jofeline
must know every corner about the place it
will be far more difficult to play off any ghostly
machinery upon him than upon strangers but
let us to our toilette and when water and brush
hath done its work we will inquire what is next
to be done
nay that wretched puritan's garb mine is
hardly worth brushing said wildrake and
but for this hundred weight rusty iron with
which thou hast bedizened me i look more like
a bankrupt quaker than anything else but i'll
make you as spruce as ever was a canting rogue
 your party
so saying and humming at the same time the
cavalier tune 
though for a time we see whitehall
with cobwebs hung around the wall
yet heaven shall make amends for all
when the king shall enjoy his own again
woodstock s
thou forgotten who are without said colonel
everard
e full tide remorseful
passion had for the time abated it was however
fierce and agitating the more so perhaps that
indulgence in strong mental feeling any kind
was foreign to the severe and ascetic character 
the man and was therefore the more overpowering
when it had at once surmounted all restraints
large tears flowed down the trembling features
 his thin and usually stern or at least austere
countenance he eagerly returned the compression
 everard's hand as if thankful for the sympathy
which the caress implied
presently after master holdenough wiped his
eyes withdrew his hand gently from that everard
shaking it kindly as they parted and prowoodstock

needed with more composure forgive me this
burst passionate feeling worthy colonel i
am conscious it little becomes a man my cloth
who should be the bearer consolation to others
to give way in mine own person to an extremity
 grief weak at least if indeed it is not sinful 
for what are we that we should weep and murmur
touching that which is permitted but albany
was to me as a brother the happiest days
 my ife ere my call to mingle myself in the
strife the land had awakened me to my duties
were spent in his company i but i will make
the rest my story short here he drew
his chair close to that everard and spoke ina
solemn and mysterious tone voice almost
lowered to a whisper i saw him last night
saw mm saw whom said everard can
you mean the person whom 
whom i saw so ruthlessly slaughtered
said the clergyman my ancient collegefriend
joseph albany
 master holdenough your cloth and your
character alike must prevent your jesting on such
a subject as this
vol 
 woodstock
jesting answered holdenough i would
as soon jest on my deathbed as soon jest upon
the bible
 but you must have been deceived answered
everard hastily this tragical story necessarily
often returns to your mind and in moments when
the imagination overcomes the evidence the
outward senses your fancy must have presented
to you an unreal appearance nothing more likely
when the mind is on the stretch after something
supernatural than that the imagination should
supply the place with a chimera while the overexcited
feelings render it difficult to dispel the
delusion
colonel everard replied holdenough with
austerity in discharge my duty i must not
fear the face man and therefore i tell you
plainly as i have done before with more observance
that when you bring your carnal learning
and judgment as it is but too much your nature
to do to investigate the hidden things another
world you might as well measure with the palm
 your hand the waters the isis indeed good
sir you err in this and give men too much pretence
to confound your honourable name with witchwoodstock

advocates freethinkers and atheists even with
such as this man bletson who if the discipline
 the church had its hands strengthened as it
was in the beginning the great conflict would
have been long ere now cast out the pale and
delivered over to the punishment the flesh
that his spirit might if possible be yet saved
you mistake master holdenough said colonel
everard i do not deny the existence 
such preternatural visitations because i cannot
and dare not raise the voice my own opinion
against the testimony ages supported by such
learned men as yourself nevertheless though i
grant the possibility such things i have scarce
yet heard an instance in ray days so well fortified
by evidence that i could at once and distinctly
say this must have happened by supernatural
agency and not otherwise
hear then what i have to tell said the divine
 on the faith a man a christian and
what is more a servant our holy church 
and therefore though unworthy an elder and a
teacher among christians i had taken my post
yester evening in the halffurnished apartment
 woodstock
wherein hangs a huge mirror which might have
served goliath gath to have admired himself
in when clothed from head to foot in his brazen
armour i the rather chose this place because
they informed me it was the nearest habitable
room to the gallery in which they say you had
been yourself assailed that evening by the evil
one was it so i pray you 
 by some one with no good intentions i was
assailed in that apartment so far said colonel
everard you were correctly informed
well i chose my post as well as i might
even as a resolved general approaches his camp
and casts up his mound as nearly as he can to
the besieged city and a truth colonel everard
if i felt some sensation bodily fear for
even elias and the prophets who commanded the
elements had a portion in our frail nature much
more such a poor sinful being as myself yet was
my hope and my courage high and i thought
 the texts which i might use not in the wicked
sense perhaps or spells as the blinded papists
employ them together with the sign the cross
and other fruitless forms but as nourishing and
woodstock itkj
supporting that true trust and confidence in the
blessed promises being the true shield faith
wherewith the fiery darts satan may be withstood
and quenched and thus armed and prepared
i sate me down to read at the same time
to write that i might compel my mind to attend
to those subjects which became the situation in
which i was placed as preventing any unlicensed
excursions the fancy and leaving no room for
my imagination to brood over idle fears so i
methodized and wrote down what i thought
meet for the time and peradventure some hungry
souls may yet profit by the food which i then
prepared
it was wisely and worthily done good and
reverend sir replied colonel everard i pray
you to proceed
while i was thus employed sir and had been
upon the matter for about three hours not yielding
to weariness a strange thrilling came over my
senses and the large and oldfashioned apartment
seemed to wax larger more gloomy and
more cavernous while the air the night grew
more cold and chill i know not if it was that
 woodstock
the fire began to decay or whether there cometh
before such things as were then about to happen
a breath and atmosphere as it were terror
as job saith in a wellknown passage fear
came upon me and trembling which made my
bones to shake and there was a tingling noise
in my ears and a dizziness in my brain so that
i felt like those who call for aid when there is no
danger and was even prompted to flee when i
saw no one to pursue it was then that something
seemed to pass behind me casting a reflection
on the great mirror before which i had placed
my writingtable and which i saw by assistance
 the great standing light which was then
in front the glass and i looked up and i saw
in the glass distinctly the appearance a man's
sure as these words issue from my mouth it
was no other than the same joseph albany the
companion my youth he whom iliad seen precipitated
down the battlements clidesthrough
castle into the deep lake below
what did you do 
it suddenly rushed on my mind said the
divine that the stoical philosopher athenodorus
woodstock 
had eluded the horrors such a vision by patiently
pursuing his studies and it shot at the same
time across my mind that i a christian divine
and a steward the mysteries had less reason
to fear evil and better matter on which to employ
my thoughts than was possessed by a heathen
who was blinded even by his own wisdom
so instead betraying any alarm or even turning
my head around i pursued my writing but
with a beating heart i admit and with a throbbing
hand
if you could write at all said the colonel
with such an impression on your mind you
may take the head the english array for
dauntless resolution
our courage is not our own colonel said
the divine and not as ours should it be vaunted
 and again when you speak this strange
vision as an impression on my fancy and not a
reality obvious to my senses let me tell you once
more your worldly wisdom is but foolishness
touching the things that are not worldly
did you not look again upon the mirror
said the colonel
 woodstock
 i did when i had copied out the comfortable
text thou shalt tread down satan under
thy feet 
and what did you then see 
the reflection the same joseph albany
said holdenough passing slowly as from behind
my chair the same in member and lineament
that i had known him in his youth excepting
that his cheek had the marks the more advanced
age at which he died and was very pale
what did you then 
i turned from the glass and plainly saw the
figure which had made the reflection in the mirror
retreating towards the door not fast nor
slow but with a gliding steady pace it turned
again when near the door and again showed me
its pale ghastly countenance before it disappeared
but how it left the room whether by the
door or otherwise my spirits were too much
hurried to remark exactly nor have i been able
by any effort recollection distinctly to remember

this is a strange and as coming from you
a most excellently wellattested apparition anwoodstock
s
jweredeverard and yet master holdenough
if the other world has been actually displayed
as you apprehend and i will not dispute the possibility
assure yourself there are also wicked
men concerned in these machinations i myself
have undergone some rencontres with visitants
who possessed bodily strength and wore i am
sure earthly weapons
oh doubtless doubtless replied master
holdenough beelzebub loves to charge with
horse and foot mingled as was the fashion the
old scotch general davie leslie he has his
devils in the body as well as his devils disembodied
and uses the one to support and back the
other
it may be as you say reverend sir answered
the colonel but what do you advise in
this case 
for that i must consult with my brethren
said the divine and if there be but left in our
borders five ministers the true kirk we will
charge satan in full body and you shall see whether
we have not power over him to resist till he
 woodstock
shall flee from us but failing that ghostly armament
against these strange and unearthly enemies
truly i would recommend that as a house
 witchcraft and abomination this polluted den
 ancient tyranny and prostitution should be totally
consumed by fire lest satan establishing
his headquarters so much to his mind should
find a garrison and a fastness from which he might
sally forth to infest the whole neighbourhood
certain it is that i would recommend to no christian
soul to inhabit the mansion and if deserted
it would become a place for wizards to play
their pranks and witches to establish their sabbath
and those who like dumas go about after
the wealth this world seeking for gold and
silver to practise spells and charms to the prejudice
 the souls the covetous trust me therefore
it were better that it were spoiled and broken
down not leaving one stone ripon another
 i say nay to that my good friend said the
colonel for the lordgeneral hath permitted
by his licence my mother's brother sir henry
lee and his family to return into the house 
his fathers being indeed the only roof under
woodstock 
which he hath any chance obtaining shelter
for his grey hairs
and was this done by your advice markham
everard said the divine austerely
 certainly it was returned the colonel
 and wherefore should i not exert mine influence
to obtain a place refuge for the brother
 my mother
 now as sure as thy soul liveth answered
the presbyter i had believed this from no
tongue but thine own tell me was it not this
very sir henry lee who by the force his
bufifcoats and his greenjerkins enforced the papist
laic's order to remove the altar to the eastern
 the church at woodstock and did not
he swear by his beard that he would hang in the
very street woodstock whoever should deny to
drink the king's health and is not his hand
red with the blood the saints and hath there
been a suffer in the field for prelacy and high
prerogative more unmitigated or fiercer 
all this may have been as you say good
master holdenough answered the colonel 
 but my uncle is now old and feeble and hath
 woodstock
scarce a single follower remaining and his daughter
is a being whom to look upon would make
the sternest weep for pity a being who
 who is dearer toeverardsaidholdenough
than his good name his faith to his friends
his duty to his religion this is no time to speak
with sugared lips the paths in which you tread
are dangerous you are striving to raise the
papistical candlestick which heaven in its justice
removed out its place to bring back to
this hall sorceries those very sinners who are
bewitched with them i will not permit the land
to be abused by their witchcraft they shall
not come hither
he spoke this with vehemence and striking
his stick against the ground and the colonel
very much dissatisfied began to express himself
haughtily in return you had better consider
your power to accomplish your threats master
holdenough he said before you urge them
so peremptorily
 and have i not the power to bind and to
loose f said the clergyman
it is a power little available save over those
woodstock 
 your own church said everard with a tone
something contemptuous
take heed take heed said the divine who
though an excellent was as we have elsewhere
seen an irritable man do not insult me but
think honourably the messenger for the sake
 him whose commission he carries do not
i say defy me i am bound to discharge my
duty were it to the displeasing my twin brother

 i can see nought your office has to do in the
matter said colonel everard and i on my
side give you warning not to attempt to meddle
beyond your commission
right you hold me already to be as submissive
as one your grenadiers replied the
clergyman his acute features trembling with a
sense indignity so as even to agitate his grey
hair but beware sir i am not so powerless as
you suppose i will invoke every true christian
in woodstock to gird up his loins and resist the
restoration prelacy oppression and malignancy
within our borders i will stir up the wrath 
the righteous against the oppressor the 
woodstock
ite the edomite and against his race and
against those who support him and encourage
him to rear up his horn i will call aloud and
spare not and arouse the many whose love hath
waxed cold and the multitude who care for
none these things there shall be a remnant
to listen to me and i will take the stick joseph
which was in the hand ephraim and
go down to cleanse this place witches and sorcerers
and enchantments and will cry and exhort
saying will you plead for baal will
you serve him nay take the prophets baal
let not a man escape
master holdcnough master holdenough
said colonel everardwith much impatience by
the tale yourself told me you have exhorted upon
that text once too often already
the old man struck his palm forcibly against
his forehead and fell back into a chair as these
words were uttered as suddenly and as much
without power resistance as if the colonel
had fired a pistol through his head instantly
regretting the reproach which he had suffered
to escape him in his impatience everard hastenwoodstock

ed to apologize and to offer every conciliatory
excuse however inconsistent which occurred to
him on the moment but the old man was too
deeply affected he rejected his hand lent no
ear to what he said and finally started up saying
sternly you have abused my confidence
sir abused it vilely to turn it into my own reproach
 had i been a man the sword you dared
not but enjoy your triumph sir over an
old man and your father's friend strike at the
wound his imprudent confidence showed you
nay my worthy and excellent friend said
the colonel
 friend answered the old man starting up
 we are foes sir foes now and for ever 
so saying and starting from the seat into which
he had rather fallen than thrown himself he ran
out the room with a precipitation step which
he was apt to use upon occasions irritable
feeling and which was certainly more eager than
dignified especially as he muttered while he ran
and seemed as if he were keeping up his own
passion by recounting over and over the offence
which he had received
soh said colonel everard and there
 woodstock
was not strife enough between mine uncle and the
people woodstock already but i must needs
increase it by chafing this irritable and quicktempered
old man eager as i knew him to be in
his ideas church government and stiff in his
prejudices respecting all who dissent from him 
the mob woodstock will rise for though
he would not get a score them to stand by him
in any honest or intelligible purpose yet let him
cry havoc and destruction and i will warrant he
has followers enow and my uncle is equally wild
and unpersuadable for the value all the estate
he ever had he would not allow a score troopers
to be quartered in the house for defence and
if he be alone or has but joceline to stand by
him he will be as sure to fire upon those who
come to attack the lodge as if he had a hundred
men in garrison and then what can chance but
danger and bloodshed 
this progress melancholy anticipation was
interrupted by the return master holdenough
who hurrying into the room with the same precipitate
pace at which he had left it ran straight
up to the colonel and said take my hand
woodstock 
markham take my hand hastily for the old
adam is whispering at my heart that it is a disgrace
to hold it extended so long
 most heartily do i receive your hand my
venerable friend said everard and i trust in
sign renewed amity
 surely surely said the divine shaking
his hand kindly thou hast it is true spoken
bitterly but thou hast spoken truth in good time
and i think though your words were severe
with a good and kindly purpose verily and 
a truth it were sinful in me again to be hasty
in provoking violence remembering that which
you have upbraided me with 
forgive me good master holdenough said
colonel everard it was a hasty word i meant
not in serious earnest to upbraid
peace i pray you peace said the divine 
i say the allusion to that which you have nost
justly upbraided me with though the charge
aroused the gall the old man within me thei
inward tempter being ever on the watch to bring
us to his lure ought instead being resented
to have been acknowledged by me as a favour for
vol n k
 woodstock
so are the wounds a friend termed faithful
and surely i who have by one unhappy exhortation
to battle and strife sent the living to the
dead and i fear brought back even the dead
amono the living should now study peace and
good will and reconciliation difference leaving
punishment to the great being whose laws
are broken and vengeance to him who hath
said i will repay it
the old man's mortified features lighted trp
with a humble confidence as he made this acknowledgment
and colonel everard who knew
the constitutional infirmities and the early prejudices
 professional consequence and exclusive
party opinion which he must have subdued ere
arriving at such a tone candour hastened to
express his admiration his christian charity
mingled with reproaches on himself for having
so deeply injured his feelings
 think not it think not it excellent
young man said holdenough we have both
erred i in suffering my zeal to outrun my charity
you perhaps in pressing hard on an ow
and peevish man who had so lately poured out
woodstock 
his sufferings into your friendly bosom be it
all forgotten let your friends if they are not
deterred by what has happened at this manor 
woodstock resume their habitation as soon as
they will if they can protect themselves against
the powers the air believe me that if i can
prevent it by aught in my power they shall have
no annoyance from earthly neighbours and
assure yourself good sir that my voice is still
worth something with the worthy mayor and
the good aldermen and the better sort housekeepers
up yonder in the town although the
lower classes are blown about with every wind
 doctrine and yet farther be assured colonel
that should your mother's brother or any 
his family learn that they have taken up a rash
bargain in returning to this unhappy and unhallowed
house or should they find any qualms in
their own hearts and consciences which require
a ghostly comforter nehemiah holdenough will
be as much at their command by night or day as
if they had been bred up within the holy pale 
the church in which he is an unworthy minister 
and neither the awe what is fearful to be seen
woodstock
within these walls nor his knowledge their
blinded and carnal state as bred up under a prelatic
dispensation shall prevent him doing what
lies in his poor abilities for their protection and
edification
 i feel all the force your kindness reverend
sir said colonel everard but i do not
think it likely that my uncle will give you trouble
on either score he is a man much accustomed
to be his own protector in temporal danger
and in spiritual doubts to trust to his own prayers
and those his church
i trust i have not been superfluous in offering
mine assistance said the old man something
jealous that his proffered spiritual aid had
been held rather intrusive i ask pardon if that
is the case i humbly ask pardon i would not
willingly be superfluous
the colonel hastened to appease this new
alarm the watchful jealousy his consequence
which joined with a natural heat temper
which he could not always subdue were the
good man's only faults
they had regained their former friendly footwoodstock

ing when roger wildrakc returned from the
hut joceline and whispered his master that
his embassy had been successful the colonel
then addressed the divine and informed him
that as the commissioners had already given up
woodstock and as his uncle sir henry lee
proposed to return to the lodge about noon he
would if his reverence pleased attend him upto
the borough
will you not tarry said the reverend man
with something like inquisitive apprehension in
his voice to welcome your relatives upon their
return to this their house 
no my good friend said colonel everard 
the part which i have taken in these unhappy
broils perhaps also the mode worship in
which i have been educated have so prejudiced
me in mine uncle's opinion that i must be for
some time a stranger to his house and family
indeed i rejoice to hear it with all my
heart and soul said the divine excuse my
frankness i do indeed rejoice i had thought
no matter what i had thought i would not
again give offence but truly though the maiden
 woodstock
hath a pleasant feature and he as all men say is
in human things unexceptionable yet but i
give you pain in sooth i will say no more unless
you ask my sincere and unprejudiced advice
which you shall command but which i will not
press on you superfluously wend we to the
borough together the pleasant solitude the
forest may dispose us to open our hearts to each
other
they did walk up to the little town in company
and somewhat to master holdenough's
surprise the colonel though they talked on various
subjects did not request him any ghostly
advice on the subject his love to his fair cousin
while greatly beyond the expectation the
soldier the clergyman kept his word and in his
own phrase was not so superfluous as to ofler
upon so delicate a point his unasked counsel

the embassy wildrake had been successful
chiefly through the mediation the episcopal
divine whom we formerly found acting in the
character chaplain to the family and whose
voice had great influence on many accounts with
its master
a little before high noon sir henry lee with
his small household was again in unchallenged
possession their old apartments at the lodge 
woodstock and the combined exertions joce
line jolliffe phoebe and old joan were
employed in putting to rights what the late intruders
had left in great disorder
sir henry lee had like all persons 
woodstock
city that period a love order amounting to
precision and felt like a fine lady whose dress
has been disordered in a crowd insulted and
humiliated by the rude confusion into which his
household goods had been thrown and impatient
till his mansion had been purified from all marks
 intrusion in his anger he uttered more orders
than the limited number his domestics were
likely to find time or hands to execute the
villains have left such sulphureous steams behind
them too said the old knight as if old davie
leslie and the whole scotch army had quartered
among them
it may be near as bad said joceline for
men say for certain it was the devil came down
bodily among them and made them troop off
then said the knight is the prince 
darkness a gentleman as old will shakspeare
says he never interferes with those his own
coat for the lees have been here father and
son these five hundred years without disquiet
and no sooner came these misbegotten churls
than he plays his own part among them
well one thing he and they have left us
woodstock 
said jouiffe which we may thank ihcm for 
and that is such a wellfilled larder and buttery
as has been seldom seen in woodstock lodge
this many a day carcases mutton large
rounds beef barrels confectioners ware
pipes and runlets sack muscadine ale and
what not we shall have a royal time on't through
half the winter and joan must get to salting and
pickling presently
out villain said the knight are we to
feed on the fragment such scum the earth
as these cast them forth instantly nay
checking himself that were a sin but give
them to the poor or see them sent to the owners
 and hark ye i will none their strong
liquors i would rather drink like a hermit all
my life than seem to pledge such scoundrels as
these in their leavings like a miserable drawer
who drains off the ends the bottles after the
guests have paid their reckoning and gone off
and hark ye i will taste no water from the
cistern out which these slaves have been serving
themselves fetch me down a pitcher from
rosamond's spring
 woottstock
jr
alice heard this in i unction and well iruessin
there was enough for the other members the
family to do she quietly took a small pitcher
and flinging a cloak around her walked out fiji
person to procure sir henry the water which he
desired meantime joceline said with some
hesitation that there was a man still remained
belonging to the party these strangers who
was directing about the removal some trunks
and mails which belonged to the commissioners
and who could receive his honour's commands
about the provisions
let him come hither the dialogue was
held in the hall why do you hesitate and
crumble in that manner 
only sir said joceline only perhaps
your honour might not wish to see him being the
same who on the night before last 
he paused
sent my rapier a hawking through the firmament
thou would'st say why when did i
take spleen at a man for standing his ground
against me roundhead as he is man i like
him the better that not the worse i hunger
woodstock 
and thirst to have another turn with him i have
thought on this passed ever since and i believe
videre it to try again i know a feat would control
it fetch him directly
trusty tomkins was presently ushered in
bearing himself with an iron gravity which neither
the terrors the preceding night nor the
dignified demeanour the highborn personage
before whom he stood were able for an instant
to overcome
 how now good fellow said sir henry 
i would fain see something more thy fence
which baffled me the other evening but truly
i think the light was somewhat too faint for my
old eyes take a foil man i walk here in the
hall as hamlet says and tis the breathingtime
 day with me take a foil then in thy hand
since it is your worship's desire said the
steward letting fall his long cloak and taking
the foil in his hand
 now said the knight if your fitness
speaks mine is ready methinks the very stepping
on this same old pavement hath charmed
away the gout which threatened mc sa ba
i tread as firm as a gamecock
j woodstock
they began the play with great spirit and
whether the old knight really fought more coolly
with the blunt than with the sharp weapon or
whether the steward gave him some grains 
advantage in this merely sportive encounter it is
certain sir henry had the better in the assault
his success put him into excellent humour
there said he i found your trick
nay you cheat me not twice the same waythere
was a very palpable hit why had i had
but light enough the other night but it skillsnot
speaking it here we leave off i must not
fight as we unwise cavaliers did with you roundhead
rascals beating you so often that we taught
you to beat us at last and good now tell me
why you are leaving your larder so full here 
do you think i or my family can use broken
victuals what have you no better employment
for your rounds sequestrated beef than
to leave them behind you when you shift your
quarters 
so please your honour said tomkins it
may be that you desire not the flesh beeves
 rams or goats nevertheless when you
woodstock 
know that the provisions were provided and paid
for out your own rents and stock at ditches
sequestrated to the use the state more than a
year since it may be you will have less scruple
to use them for your own behoof
rest assured that i shall said sir henry 
and glad you have helped me to a share 
mine own certainly i was an ass to suspect
your masters subsisting save at honest men's
expense
 and as for the rumps beeves continued
tomkins with the same solemnity there is a
rump at westminster which will stand us the
army much hacking and hewing yet ere it is discussed
to our mind
sir henry paused as if to consider what was
the meaning this inuendo for he was not a
person very quick apprehension but having
at length caught the meaning it he burst into
an explosion louder laughter than joccline had
seen him indulge in for a good while
right knave he said i taste thy jest 
it is the very moral the puppetshow faustus
woodstock
thus raised the devil as the parliament raised the
army and then as the devil flies away with
faustus so will the army fly away with the parliament
 or the rump as thou call'st it or sitting
part the socalled parliament and then
look you friend the very devil all hath my
willing consent to fly away with the army in its
turn from the highest general down to the lowest
drumboy nay never look fierce for the matter
remember there is daylight enough now fora
game at sharps
trusty tomkins appeared to think it best to
suppress his displeasure and observing that the
pains were ready to transport the commissioners
property to the borough took a grave leave
 sir henry lee
meantime the old man continued to pace his
recovered hall rubbing his hands and evincing
greater signs glee than he had shown since the
fatal th january
here we are again in the old frank joliffe
well victualled too how the knave solved
ray point conscience the dullest them is
a special casuist where the question concerns prowoodstock

fit look out if there are not some our own
ragged regiment lurking about to whom a bellyfull
would be a godsend joceline then his
fence joceline though the fellow foins well 
very sufficient well but thou saw'st how i dealt
with him when i had fitting light joceline
 ay and so your honour did said joceline
you taught him to know the duke norfolk
from saunders gardner i'll warrant him he
will not wish to come under your honour's thumb
again
 why i am waxing old said sir henry 
 but skill will not rust through age though
sinews must stiffen but my age is like a lusty
winter as old will says frosty but kindly 
and what if old as we are we live to see better
days yet i promise thee joceline i love this
jarring betwixt the rogues the board and the
rogues the sword when thieves quarrel true
men have a chance coming by their own
thus triumphed the old cavalier in the treble
glory having recovered his dwelling regained
as he thought his character as a man fence
and finally discovered some prospect a change
 woodstock
 times in which he was not without hopes that
something might turn up for the royal interest
meanwhile ace with a prouder and a glitter
heart than had danced in her bosom for several
days went forth with a gaiety to which she late
had been a stranger to contribute her assistance
to the regulation and supply the household
by bringing the fresh water wanted from fair rosamond's
well
perhaps she remembered that when she was
but a girl her cousin markham used among
others to make her perform that duty as presenting
the character some captive trojan princess
condemned by her situation to draw the
waters from some grecian spring for the use 
the proud victor at any rate she certainly
toyed to see her father reinstated in his ancient
habitation and the joy was not the less sincere
that she knew their return to woodstock had been
procured by means her cousin and that even
in her father's prejudiced eyes everard had been
in some degree exculpated the accusations the
old knight had brought against him and that
if a reconciliation had not yet taken place the
woodstock fil
preliminaries had been established on which such
a desirable conclusion might easily be founded
it was like the commencement a bridge when
the foundation is securely laid and the piers raised
above the influence the torrent the throwing
 the arches may be accomplished in a subsequent
season
the doubtful fate her only brother might
have clouded even this momentary gleam sunshine
 but alice had been bred up during the
close and frequent contests civil war and had
acquired the habit hoping in behalf those
dear to her until hope was lost in the present
case all reports seemed to assure her her brother's
safety
besides these causes for gaiety alice lee had
the pleasing feeling that she was restored to the
habitation and the haunts her childhood from
which she had not departed without much pain
the more felt perhaps because suppressed in
order to avoid irritating her father's sense his
misfortune finally she enjoyed for the instant
the gleam selfsatisfaction by which we see the
young and welldisposed so often animated when
vol i
lj woodstock
they can be in common phrase helpful to those
whom they love and perform at the moment 
need some those httle domestic tasks which
age receives with so much pleasure from the
dutiful hands youth so that altogether as
she hasted through the remains and vestiges 
a wilderness already mentioned and from thence
about a bowshot into the park to bring a pitcher
 water from rosamond's spring alice
lee her features enlivened and her complexion
a little raised by the exercise had for the moment
regained the gay and brilliant vivacity 
expression which had been the characteristic 
her beauty in her earlier and happier days
this fountain old memory had been once
adorned wide architectural ornaments in the style
 the sixteenth century chiefly relating to ancient
mythology all these were now wasted and
overthrown and existed only as mosscovered
ruins while the living spring continued to furnish
its daily treasures unrivalled in purity
though the quantity was small gushing out amid
disjointed stones and bubbling through fragments
 ancient sculpture
woodstock g
with a light step and a laughing brow the
young lady lee was approaching the fountain
usually so solitary when she paused on beholding
some one seated beside it she proceeded
however with confidence though with a step
something less gay when she observed that the
person was a female some menial perhaps from
the town whom a fanciful mistress occasionally
dispatched for the water a spring supposed to
be peculiarly pure or some aged woman who
made a little trade by carrying it to the better
sort families and selling it for a trifle there
was no cause therefore for apprehension
yet the terrors the times were so great that
alice did not even see a stranger her own sex
without some apprehension denaturalized woe
usual followed the camps both armies
during the civil war who on the one side with
open profligacy and profanity on the other with
the fraudful tone fanaticism or hypocrisy exercised
nearly in like degree their talents for murder
or plunder but it was broad daylight the
distance from the lodge was but trifling and
though a little alarmed at seeing a stranger where
she expected deep solitude the daughter the
 woodstock
haughty old knight had too much the hon
about her to fear without some determined and
decided cause
alice walked therefore gravely on toward the
fount and composed her looks as she took a hasty 
glance the female who was seated there and
addressed herself to her task filling her pitcher

the woman whose presence had surprised and
somewhat startled alice lee was a person 
the lower rank whose red cloak russet kirtle
handkerchief trimmed with coventry blue and a
coarse steeple hat could not indicate at best anything
higher than the wife a small farmer or
perhaps the helpmate a bailiff or hind it was
well if she proved nothing worse her clothes
indeed were good materials but what the female
eye discerns with half a glance they were
indifferently adjusted and put on this looked as
if they did not belong to the person by whom
they were worn but were articles which she had
become the mistress by some accident if not by
some successful robbery her size too as did
not escape alice even in the short perusal she
afforded the stranger was unusual her features
woodstock 
swarthy and singularly harsh and her manner
altogether unpropitious the young lady almost
wished as she stooped to fill her pitcher that
she had rather turned back and sent joceline
on the errand but repentance was too late now
and she had only to disguise as well as she could
her unpleasant feelings
the blessings this bright day to one as
bright as it is said the stranger with no unfriendly
though a harsh voice
i thank you said alice in reply and continued
to fill her pitcher busily by assistance 
an iron bowl which remained still chained to one
 the stones beside the fountain
perhaps my pretty maiden if you would
accept my help your work would be sooner done
said the stranger
i thank you said alice but had i needed
assistance i could have brought those with
me who had rendered it
i do not doubt that my pretty maiden
answered the female there are too many lads
in woodstock with eyes in their heads no doubt
you could have brought with you any one 
them who looked on you if you had listed
 woodstock
alice replied not a syllabic lor she did not like
the freedom used by the speaker and was desirous
to break off the conversation
are you offended my pretty mistress said
the stranger that was far from my purpose
i will put my question otherwise are the
good dames woodstock so careless their
pretty daughters as to let the flower them all
wander about the wild chase without a mother
or a somebody to prevent the fox from running
away with the lamb that carelessness methinks
shows small kindness
content yourself good woman i am not far
from protection and assistance said alice who
liked less and less the effrontery her new acquaintance

alas my pretty maiden said the stranger
patting with her large and hard hand the head
which alice had kept bended down towards the
water which she was laving it would be difficult
to hear such a pipe as yours at the town 
woodstock scream as loud as you would
alice shook the woman's hand angrily off took
up her pitcher though not above half full and
as she saw the stranger rise at the same time
woojjotock c
said not without fear doubtless but with a natural
feeling resentment and dignity i have
no reason to make my cries heard as far as woodstock
were there occasion for my crying for
help at all it is nearer at hand if i need it
she spoke not without a warrant for at the
moment broke through the bushes and stood by
her side the noble hound bevis fixing on the
stranger his eyes that glanced fire raising every
hair on his gallant mane as upright as the bristles
 a wild boar when hard pressed grinning till a
case teeth which would have matched those 
any wolf in russia were displayed in full array
and without either barking or springing seeming
by his low determined growl to await but the signal
for dashing at the female whom he plainly
considered as a suspicious person
but the stranger was undaunted my pretty
maiden she said you have indeed a formidable
guardian there where cockneys or bumpkins
are concerned but we who have been at the wars
know spells for taming such furious dragons 
and therefore let not your fourfooted protector
go loose on me for he is a noble animal and 
woodstock
thing but selfdefence would induce me to do him
injury so saying she drew a pistol from her
bosom and cocked it pointing it towards the
dog as if apprehensive that he would spring
upon her
hold woman hold said alice lee the
dog will not do you harm down bevis couch
down and ere you attempt to hurt him know
he is the favourite hound sir henry lee 
ditchley the keeper woodstock park who
would severely revenge any injury offered to him
and you pretty one are the old knight's
housekeeper doubtless i have often heard the
lees have good taste
i am his daughter good woman
his daughter i was blind but yet h is
true nothing less perfect could answer the description
which all the world has given mistress
alice lee i trust that my folly has given my
young mistress no offence and that she will allow
me in token reconciliation to fill her pitcher
and carry it as far as she will permit
as you will good mother but i am about
to return instantly to the lodge to which in
woodstock 
these times i cannot admit strangers you can
follow me no farther than the verge the wilderness
and i am already too long from home 
i will send some one to meet and relieve you 
the pitcher so saying she turned her back
with a feeling terror which she could hardly
account for and began to walk quickly towards
the lodge thinking thus to get rid her troublesome
acquaintance
but she reckoned without her host for in a
moment her new companion was by her side
not running indeed but walking with prodigious
long unwomanly strides which soon brought her
up with the hurried and timid steps the frightened
maiden but her manner was more respectful
than formerly though her voice sounded remarkably
harsh and disagreeable and her whole
appearance suggested an undefined yet irresistible
feeling apprehension
pardon a stranger lovely mistress alice
said her persecutor that was not capable 
distinguishing between a lady your high quality
and a peasant wench and who spoke to you
with a degree freedom illbefitting your rank
 woodstock
certainly and condition and which i fear has
given you offence
no offence whatever replied alice but
good woman i am near home and can excuse
your farther company you are unknown tome

but it follows not said the stranger that
your fortunes may not be known to me fair mistress
alice look on my swarthy brow england
breeds none such and in the lands from
which i come the sun which blackens our complexion
pours to make amends rays knowledge
into our brains which are denied to those
 your lukewarm climate let me look upon
your pretty hand attempting to possess herself
 it and i promise you you shallhear
what will please you
i hear what does not please me said alice
with dignity you must carry your tricks 
fortunetelling and palmistry to the women 
the village we the gentry hold them to be
either imposture or unlawful knowledge
yet you would fain hear a certain colonel
i warrant you whom certain unhappy cir
woodstock 
substances have separated from his family you
would give better than silver if i could assure
you that you would see him in a day or 
perhaps sooner
i know nothing what you speak good
woman if you want alms there is a piece silver
 it is all i have in my purse
it were pity that i should take it said the
female and yet give it me for the princess
in the fairy tale must ever deserve by her generosity
the bounty the benevolent fairy before
she is rewarded by her protection
take it take it give me my pitcher
said alice and begone yonder comes one 
my father's servants what ho joceline 
joceline 
the old fortuneteller hastily dropped something
into the pitcher as she restored it to alice
lee and plying her long limbs disappeared
speedily under cover the wood
bevis turned and backed and showed some
inclination to harass the retreat this suspicious
person yet as if uncertain ran towards jolift'e
and fawned on him to demand his advice and
 woodstock
encouragement joceline pacified the animal
and coming up to his young lady asked her
with surprise what was the matter and whether
she had been frightened alice made light 
her alarm for which indeed she could not have
assigned any very competent reason for the manners
 the woman though bold and intrusive
were not menacing she only said she had meta
fortuneteller by rosamond's well and had
had some difficulty in shaking her off
ah the gipsy thief said joceline how
well she scented there was food in the pantry 
they have noses like ravens these strollers look
you mistress alice you shall not see a raven ora
carrioncrow in all the blue sky for a mile round
you but let a sheep drop suddenly down on the
greensward and before the poor creature's dead
you shall see a dozen such guests croaking
as if inviting each other to the banquet just soit
is with these sturdy beggars you will see few
enough them when there's nothing to give
but when hough's in the pot they will have share
on't
 you are so proud your fresh supply 
woodstock iii
provender said alice that you suspect all 
a design oii't i do not think this woman will
venture near your kitchen joceline
it will be best for her health said joceline
 lest i give her a ducking for digestion but
give me the pitcher mistress alice meeter i
bear it than you how now what jingles at
the bottom have you lifted the pebbles as well
as the water 
i think the woman dropped something into
the pitcher said alice
nay we must look to that for it is like to
be a charm and we have enough the devil's
ware about woodstock already we will not
spare for the water i can run back and fill the
pitcher he poured out the water upon the
grass and at the bottom the pitcher was
found a gold ring in which was set a ruby apparently
 some value
nay if this be not enchantment i know
not what is said joceline truly mistress
alice i think you had better throw away this
gimcrack such gifts from such hands are a kind
 pressmoney which the devil uses for enlisting
 woodstock
his regiment witches and if they take but so
much as a bean from him they become his bond
slaves for ife ay you look at the gewgaw but
tomorrow you will find a lead ring and a common
pebble in its stead
nay joceline i think it will be better to
find out that darkcomplexioned woman and return
to her what seems some value so cause
inquiry to be made and be sure you return herring
it seems too valuable to be destroyed
humph that is always the way with women
murmured joceline you will never get the
best them but she is willing to save a bit 
finery well mistress alice i trust that you
are too young and too pretty to be enlisted in a
regiment witches
i shall not be afraid it till you turn conjurers
said alice so hasten to the well where
you are like still to find the woman and let her
know that alice lee desires none her gifts
any more than she did her society
so saying the young lady pursued her way
to the lodge while joceline went down to rosamond's
well to execute lier commission but
woodstock 
the fortuneteller or whoever she might be was
nowhere to be found neither finding that to bethe
case did joceline give himself much trouble
in tracking her farther
if this ring which i dare say the jade stole
somewhere said the underkeeper to himself
be worth a few nobles it is better in honest
hands than in that vagabonds my master hasa
right to all waifs and strays and certainly such
a ring in possession a gipsy must be a waif
so i shall confiscate it without scruple and apply
the produce to the support sir henry s
household which is like to be poor enough thank
heaven my military experience has taught me
how to carry hooks at my fingerends that is
trooper's law yet hang it after all i had best
take it to mark everard and ask his advice i
hold him now to be your learned counsellor in law
where mistress alice's affairs are concerned and
my learned doctor who shall be nameless for
such as concern church and state and sir henry
lee and i'll give them leave to give mine tumbles
to the kites and ravens if they find me conferring
my confidence where it is not safe

chapter vii
being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
unguided and unfriended often prove
rough and inhospitable
twelfth night
there was a little attempt at preparation now
that the dinner hour was arrived which showed
that in the opinion his few but faithful domestics
the good knight had returned hi triumph
to his home
the great tankard exhibiting in basrelief the
figure michael subduing the archenemy was
placed on the table and joceline and phoebe
dutifully attended the one behind the chair 
sir henry the other to wait upon her young
mistress and both to make out by formal and
regular observance the want a more numerous
train
 a health to king charles said the old
knight handing the massive tankard to his
woodstock 
daughter drink it ray love though it be rebel
ale which they have left us i will pledge
thee for the toast will excuse the liquor had
noll himself brewed it
the young lady touched the goblet with her
lip and returned it to her father who took a
copious draught
i will not say blessing on their hearts said
he though i must own they drank good ale
no wonder sir they come lightly by the
malt and need not spare it said joceline
 say'st thou said the knight thou shalt
finish the tankard thyself for that very jest's sake
nor was his follower slow in doing reason to the
royal pledge he bowed and replaced the tankard
saying after a triumphant glance at the
sculpture i had a jibe with that same redcoat
about the saint michael just now
redcoat ha what redcoat said the
hasty old man do any these knaves still
lurk about woodstock quoit him down stairs
instantly joceline know we not galloway
nags 
so please you he is in some charge here
vol m
 woodstock
and will speedily begone it is he he who had
a rencontre with your honour in the wood
ay but i paid him oft for it in the hall as
you yourself saw i was never in better fence in
my life joceline that same steward fellow is
not so utterly blackhearted a rogue as the most
 them joceline he fences well excellent
well i will have thee try a bout in the hall with
him lomorrow though i think he will be too
hard for thee i know thy strength to an inch
he might say this with some truth for it was
joceline's fashion when called on as sometimes
happened to fence with his patron just to put
forth as much his strength and skill as obliged
the knight to contend hard for the victory which
in the long run he always contrived to yield upto
him like a discreet servingman
and what said this roundheaded steward
 our great saint michael's standing cup 
marry he scoffed at our good saint and
said he was little better than one the golden
calves bethel but i told him he should not
talk so until one their own roundheaded saints
iliad given the devil as complete a crossbuttock
woodstock 
as saint michael had given him as tis carved
upon the cup there i trow that made him silent
enough and then he would know whether
your honour and mistress alice not to mention
old joan and myself since it is your honour's
pleasure i should take my bed here were not
afraid to sleep in a house that had been so much
disturbed but i told him we feared no fiends
or goblins having the prayers the church read
every evening
joceline said alice interrupting him
wert thou mad you know at what risk to
ourselves and the good doctor the performance
 that duty takes place
oh mistress alice said joceline a little
abashed you may be sure i spoke not a word
 the doctor no no i did not let him into
the secret that we had such a reverend chaplain
i think i know the length this man's foot
we have had a jollification or so together he
is hand and glove with me for as great a fanatic
as he is
trust him not too far said the knight
 woodstock
 nay i fear thou hast been imprudent already
and that it will be unsafe for the good man to
come here after nightfall as is proposed these
independents have noses hke bloodhounds and
can smell out a loyalist under any disguise
if your honour thinks so said joceline
i'll watch for the doctor with good will and
bring him into the lodge by the old condemned
postern and so up to this apartment and sure
this man tomkins would never presume to come
hither and the doctor may have a bed in woodstock
lodge and he never the wiser or if your
honour does not think that safe i can cut his
throat for you and i would not mind it a pin
god forbid said the knight he is under
our roof and a guest though not an invited
one go joceline it shall be thy penance for
having given thy tongue too much license to
watch for the good doctor and to take care 
his safety while he continues with us an october
night or two in the forest would finish the
good man
he's more like to finish our october than
woodstock 
our october is to finish him said the keeper 
and withdrew under the encouraging smile his
patron
he whistled bevis along with him to share in
his watch and having received exact information
where the clergyman was most likely to be
found assured his master that he would give the
most pointed attention to his safety when the
attendants had withdrawn having previously removed
the remains the meal the old knight
leaning back in his chair encouraged pleasant
visions than had late passed through his imagination
until by degrees he was surprised by
actual slumber while his daughter not venturing
to move but on tiptoe took some needlework
and bringing it close by the old mates side
employed her fingers on this task bending her eyes
from time to time on her parent with the affectionate
zeal if not the effective power a guardian
angel at length as the light faded away and
night came on she wa about to cause candles to
be brought but remembering how indifferent 
couch jocelines cottage had afforded she could
iot think interrupting the first sound and re
 woodstock
pressing sleep which her father had enjoyed in
all probability for the last two nights and days
she herself had no other amusement as she
sat facing one the great oriel windows the
same by which wildrake had on a former occasion
looked in upon tomkins and joceline while
at their computations than watching the clouds
which a lazy wind sometimes chased from the
broad disk the harvestmoon sometimes permitted
to accumulate and exclude her brightness
there is i know not why something peculiarly
pleasing to the imagination in contemplating
the queen night when she is wading
as the expression is among the vapours which she
has not power to dispel and which on their side
are unable entirely to quench her lustre it is the
striking image patient virtue calmly pursuing
her path through good report and bad report
having that excellence in herself which ought to
command all admiration but bedimmed in the
eyes the world by suffering by misfortune by
calumny
as some such reflections perhaps were passing
through alice's imagination she became senwoodstock

bible to her surprise and alarm that some one
had clambered up upon the window and was
looking into the room the idea supernatural
fear did not in the slightest degree agitate alice
she was too much accustomed to the place and
situation for folks do not see spectres in the
scenes with which they have been familiar from infancy
but danger from marauders in a disturbed
country was a more formidable subject apprehension
and the thought armed alice who was
naturally highspirited with such desperate courage
that she snatched a pistol from the wallon
which some firearms hung and while she
screamed to her father to awake had the presence
 mind to present it at the intruder she did
so the more readily because she imagined she
recognized in the visage which she partially saw
the features the woman whom she had met
with at rosamond's well and which had appeared
to her peculiarly harsh and suspicious her
father at the same time seized his sword and came
forward while the person at the window alarmed
at these demonstrations and endeavouring to
descend missed footing as had cavahero wilts
woodstock
drake before her and went down to the earth
with no small noise nor was the reception on
the bosom our common mother either soft or
safe for by a most terrific bark and growl they
heard that bevis had come up and seized on the
party ere he or she could gain their feet
hold fast but worry not said the old
knight alice thou art the queen wenches 
stand fast here till i run down and secure the
rascal
for god's sake no my dearest father 
alice exclaimed joceline will be up immediately
 hark i hear him
there was indeed a bustle below and more
than one light danced to and fro in confusion
while those who bore them called to each other
yet suppressing their voices as they spoke as
men who would only be heard by those they addressed
the individual who had fallen under
the power bevis was most impatient in his situation
and called with least precaution here
lee forester take the dog off else i must
shoot him
 if thou dost said sir henry from the win
woodstock 
dow i blow thy brains out on the spot thieves
jocehne thieves come up and secure this ruffian
 bevis hold on 
back bevis down sir cried joceline 
i am coming i am coming sir henry saint
michael i shall go distracted 
a terrible thought suddenly occurred to alice
could joceline have become unfaithful that
he was calling bevis off the villain instead encouraging
the trusty dog to secure him her
father meantime moved perhaps by some suspicion
 the same kind hastily stepped aside out
 the moonlight and pulled alice close to him
so as to be invisible from without yet so placed
as to hear what should pass the scuffle between
bevis and his prisoner seemed to be ended by
jocelines interference and there was close whispering
for an instant as people in consultation
 all is quiet now said one voice i will
up and prepare the way for you and immediately
a form presented itself on the outside
 the window pushed open the lattice and
sprung into the parlour but almost ere his step
was upon the floor certainly before he had pb
 woodstock
gained any secure footing the old knight who
stood ready with his rapier drawn made a desperate
pass which bore the intruder to the ground
eocene who clambered up next with a dark
lantern in his hand uttered a dreadful exclamation
when he saw what had happened crying
out lord in heaven he has slain his own son 
no no i tell you no said the fallen young
man who was indeed young albert lee the only
son the old knight i am not hurt no
noise on your lives get lights instantly at
the same time he started from the floor as quickly
as he could under the embarrassment a cloak
and doublet skewered as it were together by the
rapier the old knight whose pass most fortunately
had been diverted from the body 
albert by the interruption his cloak the blade
passing right across his back piercing the clothes
while the hilt coming against his side with the
whole force the lounge had borne him to the
ground
joceline all the while enjoined silence to everyone
under the strictest conjurations silence
as you would live long on earth silence as you
woodstock 
would have a place in heaven be but silent fora
few minutes all our lives depend on it
meantime he procured lights with inexpressible
dispatch and they then beheld that sir henry
on hearing the fatal words had sunk back on
one the large chairs without either motion
colour or sign life
oh brother how could you come in this
manlier said alice
ask no questions good god for what am
i reserved he gazed on his father as he spoke
who with claycold features rigidly fixed and
his arms extended in the most absolute helplessness
looked rather the image death upon a
monument than a being in whom existence was
only suspended was my life spared said
albert raising his hands with a wild gesture to
heaven only to witness such a sight as this 
we suffer what heaven permits young man
we endure our lives while heaven continues
them let me approach the same clergyman
who had read the prayers at joceline's hut now
came forward get water he said instantly
and the helpful hand and light foot 
 woodstock
alice with the readywitted tenderness which
never stagnates in vain lamentations while there
is any room for hope provided with incredible
celerity all that the clergyman called for
it is but a swoon he said on feeling sir
henry's palm a swoon produced from the
instant and unexpected shock rouse thee up
albert i promise thee it will be nothing save a
syncope a cup my dearest alice and a ribbon
or a bandage i must take some blood 
some aromatics too if they can be had my good
alice
but while alice procured the cup and bandage
stripped her father's sleeve and seemed by
intuition even to anticipate every direction 
the reverend doctor her brother hearing no
word and seeing no sign comfort stood with
both hands clasped and elevated into the air a
monument speechless despair every feature
in his face seemed to express the thought here
lies my father's corpse and it is i whose rashness
has slain him 
but when a few drops blood began to follow
the lancet at first falling singly and then
woodstock 
trickling in a freer stream when in consequence
 the application cold water to the temples
and aromatics to the nostrils the old man sighed
feebly and made an effort to move his limbs
albert lee changed his posture at once to throw
himself at the feet the clergyman and kiss if
he would have permitted him his shoes and the
hem his raiment
rise foolish youth said the good man
with a reproving tone must it be always thus
with you kneel to heaven not to the feeblest
 its agents you have been saved once again
from great danger would you deserve heaven's
bounty remember you have been preserved for
other purposes than you now think on begone
you and joceline you have a duty to discharge 
and be assured it will go better with your father's
recovery that he see you not for a few minutes
down down to the wilderness and bring in
your attendant
thanks thanks a thousand thanks answered
albert lee and springing through the
lattice he disappeared as unexpectedly as be

 woodstock
had entered at the same time joceline followed
him and by the same road
alice whose fears for her father were now
something abated upon this new movement
among the persons the scene could not resist
appealing to her venerable assistant good
doctor answer me but one question was my
brother albert here just now or have i dreamed
all that has happened for these ten minutes past
methinks but for your presence i could suppose
the whole had passed in my sleep that
horrible thrust that deathlike corpselike old
man that soldier in mute despair i must indeed
have dreamed
 if you have dreamed my sweet alice said
the doctor i wish every sick nurse had your
property since you have been attending to our
patient better during your sleep than most 
these old dormice can do when they are most
awake but your dream came through the gate
 horn my pretty darling which you must remind
me to explain to you at leisure albert has
really been here and will be here again
woodstock 
albert repeated sir henry who names
my son 
it is i my kind patron said the doctor 
permit me to bind up your arm
my wound with all my heart doctor
said sir henry raising himself and gathering his
recollection by degrees i knew old thou
wert bodycurer as well as soulcurer and served
my regiment for surgeon as well as chaplain
but where is the rascal i killed i never made
a fairer stramaon in my life the shell my
rapier struck against his ribs so dead he must
be or my right hand has forgot its cunning
 nobody was slain said the doctor we
must thank god for that since there were none
but friends to slay here is a good cloak and doublet
though wounded in a fashion which will require
some skill in tailorcraft to cure but i was
your last antagonist and took a little blood from
you merely to prepare you for the pleasure and
surprise seeing your son who though hunted
pretty close as you may believe hath made his
way from worcester hither wherewith jocehne's
assistance we will care well enough for his safe
 woodstock
ty it was even for this reason that i pressed
you to accept your nephew's proposal to return
to the old lodge where a hundred men
might be concealed though a thousand were
making search to discover them never such a
place for hideandseek as i shall make good
when i can find means to publish my wonders
 woodstock
but my son my dear son said the knight
shall i not then instantly see him and wherefore
did you not forewarn me this joyful
event 
because i was uncertain his motions
said the doctor and rather thought he was
bound for the seaside and that it would be best
to tell you his fate when he was safe on board
and in full sail for france we had appointed
to let you know all when i came hither tonight
to join you but there is a redcoat in the house
whom we care not to trust farther than we could
not help we dared not therefore venture in by
the hall and so prowling round the building
albert informed us that an old prank his
when a boy consisted entering by this wui
woodstock 
dow a lad who was with us would needs make
the experiment as there seemed to be no light in
the chamber and the moonlight without made us
liable to be detected his foot slipped and our
friend bevis came upon us
in good truth you acted simply said sir
henry to attack a garrison without a summons
but all this is nothing to my son albert where
is he let me see him
but sir henry wait said the doctor till
your restored strength 
a plague my restored strength man 
answered the knight as his old spirit began to
awaken within him dost not remember that
i lay on edgehillfield all night bleeding like a
bullock from five several wounds and wore my
armour within six weeks and you talk to me 
the few drops blood that follow such a scratch
as a cat's claw might have made 
nay if you feel so courageous said the
doctor i will fetch your son he is not far distant

so saying he left the apartment making a sign
to alice to remain in case any symptoms her
father's weakness should return
vol n
 woodstock
it was fortunate perhaps that sir henry never
seemed to recollect the precise nature the
alarm which had at once and effectually as the
shock the thunderbolt for the moment suspended
his faculties something he said more
than once being certain he had done mischief
with that stramafon as he called it but his mind
did not recur to that danger as having been incurred
by his son alice glad to see that her
father appeared to have forgotten a circumstance
so fearful as men often forget the blow or other
sudden cause which has thrown them into a
swoon readily excused herself from giving much
light on the matter by pleading the general confusion
and in a few minutes albert cut off all
farther inquiry by entering the room followed
by the doctor and throwing himself alternately
into the arms his father and his sister
woodstock 
chapter viii
the boy is hark ye sirrah what's your name 
oh jacob ay i recollect the same
crabbe
the affectionate relatives were united as those
who meeting under great adversity feel still the
happiness sharing it in common they embraced
again and again and gave way to those expansions
 the heart which at once express and
relieve the pressure mental agitation at length
the tide emotion began to subside and sir
henry still holding his recovered son by the hand
resumed the command his feelings which he
usually practised
so you have seen the last our battles
albert he said and the king's colours have
fallen for ever before the rebels 
it is but even so said the young man 
the last cast the die was thrown and alas 
 woodstock
lost at worcester and cromweirs fortune carried
it there as it has wherever he has shown himself
 well it can but be for a time it can but
be for a time answered his father the devil
is potent they say in raising and gratifying favourites
but he can grant but short leases and
the king the king albert the king in my
ear close close 
our last news were confident that he had
escaped from bristol
thank god for that thank god for that 
said the knight where didst thou leave him p
our jan were almost all cut to pieces at the
bridge albert replied but i followed his majesty
with about five hundred other officers and
gentlemen who were resolved to die around him
until as our numbers and appearance drew the
whole pursuit after us it pleased his majesty to
dismiss us with many thanks and words comfort
to us in general and some kind expressions
to most us in especial he sent his royal greeting
to you sir in particular and said more than
becomes me to repeat
nay i will hear it every word boy said
woodstock 
sir henry is not the certainty that thou hast
discharged thy duty and that king charles owns
it enough to console me for all we have lost and
suffered and wouwst thou stint me it from a
false shamefacedness i will have it out thee
were it drawn from thee with cords 
it shall need no such compulsion said the
young man it was his majesty's pleasure to
bid me tell sir henry lee in his name that
if his son could not go before his father in the
race loyalty he was at least following him
closely and would soon move side by side
said he so answered the knight old
victor lee will look down with pride on thee
albert but i forget you must be weary and
hungry
even so sir said albert but these are
things which late i have been in the habit 
enduring for safety's sake
joceline what ho joccline 
the underkeeper entered and received orders
to get supper prepared directly
my son and dr rochccliffe are half starving
said the knight
and there is a lad too below said joce
 woodstock
line a page he says colonel albert's whose
belly rings cupboard too and that to no common
tune for i think he could eat a horse as the
yorksmireman says behind the saddle he had
better eat at the sideboard for he has devoured
a whole loaf bread and butter as fast as
phoebe could cut it and it has not staid his stomach
for a minute and truly i think you had
better keep him under your own eyes for the
steward beneath might ask him troublesome questions
if he went below and then he is impatient
as all your gentlemen pages are and is saucy
among the women 
whom is it he talks what page hast
thou got albert that bears himself so ill said
sir henry
the son a dear friend a noble lord 
scotland who followed the great montrose's banner
 afterwards joined the king in scotland and
came with him as far as worcester he was
wounded the day before the battle and conjured
me to take this youth under my charge which i
did something unwillingly but i could not refuse
a father perhaps on his deathbed pleading
for the safety an only son
woodstock 
thou hadst deserved an halter hadst thou
hesitated said sir henry the smallest tree
can always give some shelter and it pleases me
to think the old stock lee is not so totally prostrate
but it may yet be a refuge for the distressed
fetch the youth in he is noble blood
and these are no times ceremony he shall sit
with us at the same table page though he be 
and if you have not schooled him handsomely in
his manners he may not be the worse some lessons
fi'om me
you will excuse his national drawling accent
sir said albert though i know you like it not
i have small cause albert answered the
knight small cause who stirred up these
disunion the scots who strengthened the
hands parliament when their cause was well
nigh ruined the scots again who delivered
up the king their countryman who had flung
himself upon their protection the scots again
but this lad's father you say has fought on the
part the noble montrose and such a man as
the great marquis may make amends for the degeneracy
 a whole nation
 woodstock
i
nay father said albert and i must add
that though this lad is uncouth and wayward
and as you will see something wilful yet the
king has not a more zealous friend in england 
and when occasion offered he fought stoutly too
in his defence i marvel he comes not
he hath taken the bath said joceline and
nothing less would serve than that he should have
it immediately the supper he said might be got
ready in the meantime and he commands all
about him as if he were in his father's old castle
where he might have called long enough i warrant
without any one to hear him
indeed said sir henry this must be a
forward chick the game to crow so early 
what is his name 
his name it escapes me every hour it is
so hard a one said albert kerneguy is his
name louis kerneguy his father was lord
killstewers kincardineshire
kerneguy and killstewers and kin what
d'ye call it truly said the knight these
northern men's names and titles smack their
origin they sordid like a northwest wind rumbling
and roaring among heather and rocks
woodstock 
it is but the asperities the celtic and
saxon dialects said dr rochecliffe which
according to verstegan still linger in those northern
parts the island but peace here comes
supper and master louis kerneguy
supper entered accordingly borne in by joce
line and phoebe and after it leaning on a huge
knotty stick and having his nose in the air like
a questing hound for his attention was apparently
more fixed on the good provisions that
went before him than anything else came master
kerneguy and seated himself without much
ceremony at the lower the table
he was a tall rawboned lad with a shock
head hair fiery red like many his country
while the harshness his national features was
increased by the contrast his complexion turned
almost black by the exposure to all sorts 
weather which in that skulking and rambling
mode life the fugitive royalists had been obliged
to encounter his address was by no means prepossessing
being a mixture awkwardness and
forwardness and showing in a remarkable degree
how a want easy address may be consistent with
an admirable stock assurance his face inti
wi woodstock
mated having received some recent scratches
and the care dr rochecliffe had decorated it
with a number patches which even enhanced
its natural plainness yet the eyes were brilliant
and expressive and amid his ugliness for it
amounted to that degree irregularity the face
vas not deficient in some lines which expressed
both sagacity and resolution
the dress albert himself was far beneath his
quality as the son sir henry lee and commander
 a regiment in the royal service but
that his page was still more dilapidated a
disastrous green jerkin which had been changed
to a hundred hues by sun and rain so that the
original could scarce be discovered huge clouterly
shoes leathern breeches such as were worn by
hedgers coarse grey worsted stockings were the
attire the honourable youth whose limping gait
while it added to the ungainliness his manner
showed at the same time the extent his sufferings
his appearance bordered so much upon
what is vulgarly called the queer that even with
alice it would have excited some sense ridiculehad
not compassion been predominant
the grace was said and the young squire 
ditchley as well as dr rochecliffe made an excellent
figure at a meal the like which in quality
and abundance did not seem to have lately
fallen to their share but their feats were child'splay
to those the scotch youth far from betraying
any symptoms the bread and butter with
which he had attempted to close the orifice his
stomach his appetite appeared to have been sharpened
by a nine days fast and the knight was
disposed to think that the very genius famine
himself come forth from his native regions the
north was in the act honouring him with a
visit while as if afraid losing a moment's exertion
master kerneguy never looked either to right
or left or spoke a single word to any at table
i am glad to see that you have brought a
good appetite for our country fare young gentleman
said sir henry
bread gude sir said the page an
ye'll find flesh i've find appetite conforming ony
day o the year but the truth is sir that the
appcteesement has been coming on for three days
or four and the meat in this southland your
 woodstock
has been scarce and hard to come by so sir
i'm making up for lost time as the piper sago
said when he eat a hail side o mutton
you have been countrybred young man
said the knight who like others his time held
the reins discipline rather tight over the rising
generation at least to judge from the youths
 scotland whom i have seen at his late majesty's
court in former days they had less appetite
and more more as he sought the qualifying
phrase which might supply the place good
manners his guest closed the sentence in his
own way and more meat it may be the
better luck theirs
sir henry stared and was silent his son seemed
to think it time to interpose my dear father
he said think how many years have run
since the thirtyeight when the scottish troubles
first began and i am sure that you will not
wonder that while the barons scotland have
been for one cause or other perpetually in the
field the education their children at home must
have been much neglected and that young men
 my friend's age know better about using a
woodstock soc
broadsword or tossing a pike than about the decent
ceremonials society
the reason is a sufficient one said the
knight and since thou mayest thy follower
vertigo can fight well not let him lack victuals
a god's name see he looks angrily still at
yonder cold loin mutton for god's sake put
it all on his plate 
i can bide the bit and the buffet said the
honourable master kerneguy a hungry tyke
ne'er minds a blaud with a rough bane
now god ha mercy albert but if this bethe
son a scots peer said sir henry to his
son in a low tone voice i would not bethe
english ploughman who would change manners
with him for his ancient blood and his nobility
and his estate to boot an he has one he
has eaten as i am a christian near four pounds
 solid butcher's meat and with the grace a
wolf tugging at the carcase a dead horse oh
he is about to drink at last soh he wipes his
mouth though and dips his fingers in the ewer
and dries them i profess with the napkin 
there is some grace in him after all
dog woodstock
 here is passing all your vara gude healths 
said the youth quality and took a draught in
proportion to the sods which he had sent before
 he then flung his knife and fork awkwardly
on the trencher which he pushed back towards
the centre the table extended his feet beneath
it till they rested on their heels folded his arms on
his wellreplenished stomach and lolling back in
his chair looked much as if he was about to whistle
himself asleep
 soh said the knight the honourable
master vertigo hath laid down his arms withdraw
these things and give us our glasses fill
them around jocehne and if the devil or the
whole parliament were within hearing let them
hear henry lee ditchley drink a health to
kmg charles and confusion to his enemies 
 amen said a voice from behind the door
all the company looked at each other in astonishment
at a response so little expected it was
followed by a solemn and peculiar tap such as a
kind freemasonry had introduced among royalists
and by which they were accustomed to make
woodstock 
themselves and their principles known to each other
when they met by accident
there is no danger said albert knowing
the sign it is a friend yet i wish he had been
at a greater distance just now
and why my son should you wish the absence
 one true man who may perhaps wish
to share our abundance on one those rare occasions
when we have superfluity at our disposal
 go joceline see who knocks and if a
safe man admit him
 and if otherwise said joceline methinks
i shall be able to prevent his troubling the good
company
no violence joceline on your life said
albert lee and alice echoed for god's sake
no violence 
no unnecessary violence at least said the
good knight for if the time demands it i will
have it seen that i am master my own house
joceline jolift'e nodded assent to all parties and
went on tiptoe to exchange one or two other mysterious
symbols and knocks ere he opened the
door it may be here remarked that this species
sos woodstock
 secret association with its signals union existed
among the more dissolute and desperate class
 cavaliers men habituated to the dissipated life
which they had been accustomed to in an illdisciplined
army where everything like order and
regularity was too apt to be accounted a badge 
puritanism these were the roaring boys who
met in hedge alehouses and when they had by
any chance obtained a little money or a little
credit determined to create a counterrevolution
by declaring their sittings permanent and proclaimed
in the words one their choicest ditties

we'll drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
the leaders and gentry a higher description
and more regular morals did not indeed partake
such excesses but they still kept their eye upon
a class persons who from courage and desperation
were capable serving on an advantageous
occasion the fallen cause royalty and recorded
the lodges and blindtaverns at which
they met as wholesale merchants know the houses
 call the mechanics whom they may have
occasion to employ and can tell where they may
woodstock j
i
lind them when need requires it is scarce necessary
to add that among the lower class and
sometimes even among the higher there were men
found capable betraying the projects and conspiracies
 their associates whether well or indifferently
combined to the governors the state
cromwell in particular had gained some correspondents
 this kind the highest rank and
 the most undoubted character among the royalists
who if they made scruple impeaching
or betraying individuals who confided in them
had no hesitation in giving the government such
general information as served to enable him to disappoint
the purposes any plot or conspiracy
to return to our story in much shorter time
than we have spent in reminding the reader 
these historical particulars joliffe had made his
mystic communication and being duly answered
as by one the initiated he undid the door and
there entered our old friend roger wildrake
roundhead in dress as his safety and his dependence
on colonel everard compelled him to
be but that dress worn in a most cavalierlike
manner and forming a stronger contrast than
vol o
 woodstock
usual with the demeanour and language the
wearer to which it was never very congenial
his puritanic hat the emblem that ralph
in the prints to hudibras or as he called it
his feltumbrella was set most knowingly on one
side the head as if it had been a spanish hat
and feather his straight squarecaped sadcoloured
cloak was flung gaily upon one shoulder
as if it had been threepiled tafteta lined with
crimson silk and he paraded his huge calfskin
boots as if they had been silken hose and spanish
leather shoes with roses on the instep in short
the airs which he gave himself a most thoroughpaced
wild gallant and cavalier joined to a glistening
 selfsatisfaction in his eye and an inimitable
swagger in his gait which completely announced
his thoughtless conceited and reckless
character formed a most ridiculous contrast to his
gravity attire
it could not on the other hand be denied that
in spite the touch ridicule which attached to
his character and the loose morality which he
had learned in the dissipation town pleasures
and afterwards in the disorderly life a soldier
wildrake had points about him both to make him
woodstock 
feared and respected he was handsome even in
spite his air debauched effrontery a man
 the most decided courage though his vaunting
rendered it sometimes doubtful and entertained
a sincere sense his political principles such as
they were though he was often so imprudent in
asserting and boasting them as joined with
this dependence on colonel everard induced prudent
men to doubt his sincerity
such as he was however he entered the parlour
 victor lee where his presence was anything
but desirable to the parties present with
a jaunty step and a consciousness deserving
the best possible reception this assurance was
greatly aided by circumstances which rendered it
obvious that if the jocund cavalier had limited
himself to one draught liquor that evening in
terms his vow temperance it must have been
a very deep and long one
save ye gentlemen save ye save you good
sir henry lee though i have scarce the honour
to be known to you save you worthy doctor
and a speedy resurrection to the fallen church 
england's
you are welcome sir said sir henry time
 woodstock
whose feelings hospitality and the fraternal
reception due to a royalist sufferer induced him
to tolerate this intrusion more than he might have
done otherwise if you have fought or suffered
for the king sir it is an excuse for joining us
and commanding our services in anything in our
power although at present we are a family party
but i think i saw you in waiting upon master
markham everard who calls himself colonel
everard if your message is from him you may
wish to see me in private 
not at all sir henry not at all it is true
as my ill hap will have it that being on the stormy
side the hedge like all honest men you understand
me sir henry i am glad as it were to
gain something from my old friend and comrade's
countenance not by truckling or disowning my
principles sir i defy such practices but in
short by doing him any kindness in rrty power
when he is pleased to call on me so i came down
here with a message from him to the old roundheaded
son a i beg the young lady's pardon
from the crown her head down to the very
toes her slipper and so sir chancing as i
was stumbling out in the dark i heard you give
woodstock s
a toast sir which warmed my heart sir and ever
will sir till death chills it and so i made bold
to let you know there was an honest man within
hearing
such was the selfintroduction master drake
to which the knight replied by asking him to
sit down and take a glass sack to his majesty's
glorious restoration wildrake at this hint squeezed
in without ceremony beside the young scotchman
and not only pledged his landlord's toast
but seconded its import by volunteering a verse
or two his favourite loyal ditty the king
shall enjoy his own again the heartiness which
he threw into his song opened still farther the
heart the old knight though albert and alice
looked at each other with looks resentful the
intrusion and desirous to put an to it the
honourable master kerneguy either possessed that
happy indifference temper which does not deign
to notice such circumstances or he was able to
assume the appearance it to perfection as he
sat sipping sack and cracking walnuts without
testifying the least sense that an addition had been
made to the party wildrake who liked the liquor
and the company showed no unwillingness
il woodstock
to repay this landlord by being at the expense 
the conversation
you talk fighting and suffering sir henry
lee lord help us we have all had our share
all the world knows what sir henry lee has
done from edgefield downwards wherever a loyal
sword was drawn or a loyal flag fluttered ah
god help us i have done something too my
name is roger wildrake squattleseamere 
lincoln not that you are ever like to have heard
it before but i was captain in lunsford's lighthorse
and afterwards with goring i was a
childeater sir a babe bolter
i have heard your regiment's exploits sir 
and perhaps you may find i have seen some 
them if we should spend ten minutes together 
and i think i have heard your name too i
beg to drink your health captain wildrake 
squattleseamere lincolnshire 
sir henry i drink yours in this pint bumper
and upon my knee and i would do as much
for that young gentleman looking at albert 
and the squire the green cassock too holding
it for green as the colours are not to my eyes altogether
clear and distinguishable
woodstock 
it was a remarkable part what is culled by
theatrical folks the byplay this scene that
albert was conversing apart with doctor rochecliffs
in whispers even more than the divine seemed
desirous encouraging yet to whatever their
private conversation referred it did not deprive
the young colonel from the power listening to
what was going forward in the party at large and
interfering from time to time like a watchdog
who can distinguish the slightest alarm even when
employed in the engrossing process taking his
food
captain wildrake said albert we have
no objection i mean my friend and i to be
communicative on proper occasions but you sir
who are so old a sufferer must needs know that
at such casual meetings as this men do not mention
their names unless they are specially wanted
it is a point conscience sir to be able to say
if your principal captain everard or colonel
everard if he be a colonel should examine you
upon oath i did not know who the persons were
whom i heard drink such and such toasts
faith i have a better way it worthy sir
answered wildrake i never can for the life
 woodstock
 me remember that there were any such and
such toasts drunk at all its a strange swift forgetfulness
i have
well sh replied the younger lee but
we who have unhappily more tenacious memories
would willingly abide by the more general rule
oh sir answered wildrake with all my
heart intrude on no man's confidence d n me
and i only spoke for civility's sake having the
purpose drinking your health in a good fashion
then he broke forth into melody 
then let the health go round around around around
then let the health go round 
for though your stocking be ilk
your knee shall kiss the ground aground aground aground
your knee shall kiss the ground 
urge it no farther said sir henry addressing
his son master wildrake is one the old
school one the tantivy boys and we must
bear a little for if they drmk hard they fought
well i will never forget how a party came up
and rescued us clerks oxford as they called
the regiment i belonged to out a cursed embroglie
during the attack on brentford i tell you
we were enclosed with the cockneys pikes both
li'ont and rear and we should have come off but
woodstock 
ill had not lunsford's light horse the babceatcrs
as they called them charged up to the pike's
point and brought us off
i am glad you thought on that sir henry
said wildrake and do you remember what the
officer lunsford's said 
i think i do said sir henry smiling
well then did not he call out when the women
were coming down howling like syrens as
they were have none you a plump child that
you could give us to break our fast upon t 
truth itself said the knight and a great
fat woman stepped forward with a baby and offered
it to the supposed cannibal
all at the table master kerneguy excepted
who seemed to think that good food any kind
required no apology held up their hands in token
 amazement
ay said wildrake the ahem i
crave the lady's pardon again from tip topknot
to hem farthingale but the cursed creature
proved to be a parish nurse who had been paid
for the child half a year in advance gad i took
the baby out the bitchwolf's hand and i have
contrived though god knows i have lived in a
s
woodstock
sheltering sort way myself to breed up bold
breakfast as i call him ever since it was paying
dear for a jest though
sir i honour you for your humanity sir
i thank you for your courage sir i am glad to
see you here said the good knight his eyes watering
almost to overflowing so you were the
wild officer who cut us out the toils oh sir
had you but stopped when i called on you and allowed
us to clear the streets brentford with our
musketeers we would have been at london stone
that day but your good will was the same
ay truly was it said wildrake who now sat
triumphant and glorious in his easychair and
here is to all the brave hearts sir that fought and
fell in that same storm brentford we drove
all before us like chaff till the shops where they
sold strong waters and other temptations brought
us up gad sir we the babeeaters had too many
acquaintances in brentford and our stout prince
rupert was ever better at making way than drawing
off gad sir for my own poor share i did
but go into the house a poor widow lady who
maintained a charge daughters and whom i had
known old to get my horse fed a morsel 
woodstock 
meat and so forth when these cockneypikes 
the artillery ground as you very well call them
rallied and came in with their armed heads as
boldly as so many cotswold rams i sprang downstairs
 got to my horse but egad i fancy all my
troop had widows and orphan maidens to comfort
as well as i for only five us got together we
cut our way through successfully and gad gentlemen
i carried my little breakfast on the pommel
before me and there was such a hollowing
and screeching as if the whole town thought i
was to kill roast and eat the poor child so soon
as i got to quarters but devil a cockney charged
up to my bonny bay poor lass to rescue little
cakebread they only cried haro and out upon
me
alas alas said the knight we made
ourselves seem worse than we were and we were
too bad to deserve god's blessing even in a good
cause but it is needless to look back we did
not deserve victories when god gave them for
we never improved them like good soldiers or
like christian men and so we gave these canting
scoundrels the advantage us for they assumed
out mere hypocrisy the discipline and orderly
 woodstock
behaviour which we who drew our swords in a
better cause ought to have practised out true
principle but here is my hand captain i have
often wished to see the honest fellow who charged
up so smartly in our behalf and i reverence you
for the care you took the poor child i am glad
this dilapidated place has still some hospitality to
offer you although we cannot treat you to roasted
babes or stewed sucklings eh captain
troth sir henry the scandal was sore against
us on that score i remember lacy who was an
old playactor and a lieutenant in ours made
drollery on it in a play which was sometimes
acted at oxford when our hearts were something
up called i think the old troop
this curious old play may be consulted by the dramatic
antiquary a scene or two it turns on the strange impression
made on the country people that the cavaliers actually eat children
it was written by lacy a player who had served in this
same old troop which lay under such evil reputation miss
edgeworth has quoted a verse a popular poem referring to the
same prejudice 
the pest that came from coventry
riding in a red rochet
had news to tell how lunsford fell
a child's hand in his pocket
it was not a small cause the violent prejudices the citizen
woodstock 
so saying and feeling more familiar as his merits
were known he hitched his chair up against
that the scottish lad who was seated next him
and who in shifting his place was awkward
enough to disturb in his turn alice lee who
sate opposite and a little offended or at least
embarrassed drew her chair away from the table
 i crave pardon said the honourable master
kerneguy but sir to master wildrake yc
hae e'en garret me hurt the young lady's shank
i crave your pardon sir and much more
that the fair lady as is reasonable though rat
me sir if it was i set your chair atrundling in
that way zooks sir i have brought with mc
no plague nor pestilence nor other infectious
disorder that ye should have started away as if
i had been a leper and discomposed the lady
which i would have prevented with my life sir
sir if ye be northern born as your tongue bespeaks
egad it was i ran the risk in drawing near
you so there was small reason for you to bolt
master wildrake said albert interfering
 london against king charles that he had attempted to put
this same liunsford thought capable such ferocious proceedings
into the government the tower london
woodstock
this young gentleman is a stranger as well as
you under protection sir henry's hospitality
and it cannot be agreeable for my father to see disputes
arise among his guests you may mistake
the young gentleman's quality from his present
appearance this is the honourable master louis
kerneguy sir son my lord listeners kincardiganshire
one who has fought for the king
young as he is
no dispute shall rise through me sir none
through me said wildrake your exposition
suffice sir master louis girnigo son my
lord kilsteer in gringardenshire i am your
humble slave sir and drink your health in token
that i honour you and all true scots who draw
their andrew ferrara on the right side sir
ise beholden to you and thank you sir
said the young man with some haughtiness 
manner which hardly corresponded with his rusticity
 and i fuss your health in a ceevil way
most judicious persons would have here dropped
the conversation but it was one wildrake's
marked peculiarities that he could never let matters
stand when they were well he continued to
plague the shy proud and awkward lad with his
woodstock 
observations you speak sour national dialect
pretty strongly master girnigo said he but
i think not quite the language the gallants
that i have known among the scottish cavaliers
i knew for example some the gordon
and others good repute who always put an
for the wh asjaat for what jan for zahen and
the like
albert lee here interposed and said that the
provinces scotland like those england had
their different modes pronunciation
you are very right sir said wildrake
i reckon myself now a pretty good speaker 
their cursed jargon no offence young gentleman
 and yet when i took a turn with some 
montrose's folks in the south hieland as they
call their beastly wildernesses no offence again
i chanced to be by myself and to lose my way
when i said to a shepherdfellow making my
mouth as wide and my voice as broad as i could
shore am i ganging till confound me if the
fellow could answer me unless indeed he was
sulky as the bumpkins will be now and then to
the gentlemen the sword
this was familiarly spoken and though partly
s woods rocif
addressed to albert was stili more directed to his
immediate neighbour the young scotsman who
seemed from bashfulness or some other reason
rather shy his intimacy to one or two personal
touches from wildrake's elbow administered
during his last speech by way a practical
appeal to him in particular he only answered
misunderstandings were to be expected when
men converse in national dialects
wildrake now considerably drunker than he
ought to have been in civil company caught up
the phrase and repeated it misunderstanding
sir misunderstanding sir i do not know
how i came to construe that sir but to judge
from the information these scratches on your
honourable visnomy i should augur that you
had been late at misunderstanding with the
cat sir
you are mistaken then friend for it was
with the down answered the scotsman drily
and cast a look towards albert
we had some trouble with the watch dogs in
entering so late in the evening said albert in explanation
 and this youth had a fall among some
rubbish by which he came by these scratches 
woodstock 
and now dear sir henry said dr jlochecliffe
 allow us to remind you your gout and our
long journey i do it the rather that my good
friend your son has been during the whole time
 supper putting questions to me aside which
had much better be reserved till tomorrow may
we therefore ask permission to retire to our night's
rest 
 these private committees in a merry meeting
said wildrake are a solecism in breeding
they always put me in mind the cursed committees
at westminster but shall we to roost
before we rouse the nightowl with a catch 
 aha canst thou quote shakspeare said sir
henry pleased at discovering a new good quality
in his acquaintance whose military services were
otherwise but just able to counterbalance the
intrusive freedom his conversation in the
name merry will he continued whom i
never saw though i have seen many his comrades
as aueyn hemmings and so on we will
have a single catch and one rouse about and then
to beds
after the usual discussion about the choice 
vol i
 woodstock
the song and the parts which each was to bear
they united their voices in trolling a loyal glee
which was popular among the party at the time
and in fact believed to be composed by no less a
person than doctor rochecliffe himself
glee f or king charles
bring the bowl which you boast
fill it up to the brim 
tis to him we love most
and to all who love him
brave gallants stand up
and ay aunt ye base charles 
were there death in the cup
here's a health to king charles 
though he wanders through dangers
unaided unknown
dependent on strangers
estranged from his own 
though tis under our breath
amidst forfeits and perils
here's to honour and faith
and a health to king charles 
let such honours abound
as the time can afford
the knee on the ground
and the hand on the sword 
but the time shall come round
when mid lords dukes and earls
the loud trumpets shall sound
here's a health to king charles 
woodstock 
after this display loyalty and a final libation
the party took leave each other for the night
sir henry offered his old acquaintance wildrake
a bed for the evening who weighed the matter
somewhat in this fashion why to speak truth
my patron will expect me at the borough but then
he is used to my staying out doors a nights
then there's the devil that they say haunts woodstock
 but with the blessing this reverend doctor
i defy him and all his works i saw him not
when i slept here twice before and i am sure if
he was absent then he has not come back with sir
henry lee and his family so i accept your courtesy
sir henry and i thank you as a cavalier 
lunsford should thank one the fighting clerks
 oxon god bless the king i care not who
hears it and confusion to noll and his red nose 
off he went accordingly with a bottleswagger
guided by joceline to whom albert in the meantime
had whispered to be sure to quarter him
far enough from the rest the family
young lee then saluted his sister and with
the formality those times asked and received
lois father's blessing with an affectionate embrace
his page seemed desirous to imitate one part 
 woodstock
his example but was repelled by alice who only
replied to his offered salute with a curtsey he
next bowed his head in an awkward fashion to her
father who wished him a good night i am glad
to see young man he said that you have at
least learned the reverence due to age it should
always be paid sir because in doing so you render
that honour to others which you will expect yourself
to receive when you approach the close 
your life more will i speak with you at leisure
on your duties as a page which office in former days
used to be the very school chivalry whereas 
late by the disorderly times it has become little
better than a school wild and disordered license 
which made rare ben jonson exclaim 
 nay father said albert interposing you
must consider this day's fatigue and the poor lad
is almost asleep on his legs tomorrow he will
listen with more profit to your kind admonitions
and you louis remember at least one part 
your duty take the candles and light us here
joccline comes to show us the may once more
good night ijood doctor rochcclifie good night

richard 
albert and his page were ushered by joce
line to what was called the spanish chamber
a huge old scrambling bedroom rather in a dilapidated
condition but furnished with a large
standing bed for the master and a trucklebed
for the domestic as was common at a much later
period in old english houses where the gentleman
often required the assistance a groom 
the chambers to help him to bed if the hospitality
had been exuberant the walls were covered
with hangings cordovan leather stamped
with gold and representing fights between the
 woodstock
spaniards and moriscoes bullfeasts and other
sports peculiar to the peninsula from which it
took its name the spanish chamber these
hangings were in some places entirely torn down
in others defaced and hanging in tatters but
albert stopped not to make observations anxious
it seemed to get joceline out the room which
he achieved by hastily answering his offers fresh
fuel and more liquor in the negative and returning
with equal conciseness the underkeeper's
good wishes for the evening he at length retired
somewhat unwillingly and as if he thought
that his young master might have bestowed a few
more words upon a faithful old retainer after so
long absence
joliffe was no sooner gone than before a single
word was spoken between albert lee and his
page the former hastened to the door examined
lock latch and bolt and made them fast with the
most scrupulous attention he superadded to
these precautions that a long screwbolt which
he brought out his pocket and which he screwed
on to the staple in such a manner as to render
it impossible to withdraw it or open the door unwoodstock
sapless
by breaking it down the page held alight to
him during the operation which his master went
through with much exactness and dexterity but
when albert arose from his knee on which he had
rested during the accomplishment this task the
manner the companions was on the sudden entirely
changed towards each other the honourable
master kerneguy from a cubbish lout a
raw scotsman seemed to have acquired at once
all the grace and ease motion and manner
which could be given by an acquaintance the
earliest and most familiar kind with the best company
 the time
he gave the light he held to albert with the
easy indifference a superior who rather graces
than troubles his dependent by giving him some
slight service to perform albert with the greatest
appearance deference assumed in his turn
the character torchbearer and lighted his page
across the chamber without turning his back upon
him as he did so he then set the light on a table
by the bedside and approaching the young man
with deep reverence received from him the soiled
green jacket with the same profound respect as
 woodstock
if he had been a first lord the bedchamber
or other officer the household the highest
distinction disrobing his sovereign the mantle
 the garter the person to whom this ceremony
was addressed endured it for a minute or
two with profound gravity and then bursting out
alaughing exclaimed to albert what a devil
means all this formality thou compliments
with these miserable rags as if they were silks
and sables and with poor louis kerneguy as if
he were the king great britain 
and if your majesty's commands and the
circumstances the time have made me for a moment
seem to forget that you are my sovereign
surely i may be permitted to render my homage
as such while you are in your own royal palace 
woodstock
truly replied the disguised monarch the
sovereign and the palace are not ill matched 
these tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suit
each other admirably this woodstock this
the bower where the royal norman revelled with
the fair rosamond clifford why it is a place
cf assignation for owls then suddenly recollectwoodstock

ing himself with his natural courtesy he added
as if fearing he might have hurt albert's feelings
but the more obscure and retired it is the
fitter for our purpose lee and if it does seem to
be a roost for owls as there is no denying why
we know it has nevertheless brought up eagles
he threw himself as he spoke upon a chair and
indolently but gracefully received the kind offices
 albert who undid the coarse buttoning his
leathern gashes which defended his legs and
spoke to him the whilst what a fine specimen
 the olden time is your father sir henry it is
strange i should not have seen him before but
i heard my father often speak him as being
among the flower our real old english gentry
by the mode in which he began to school me i
can guess you had a tight taskmaster him albert
 i warrant you never wore hat in his presence
eh 
i never cocked it at least in his presence
please your majesty as i have seen some youngsters
do answered albert indeed if i had it
must have been a stout beaver to have saved me
from a broken head
woodstock
oh i doubt it not replied the king a
fine old gentleman but with that methinks in his
countenance that assures you he would not hate
the child in sparing the rod hark ye albert 
suppose the same glorious restoration come
round which if drinking to its arrival can hasten
it should not be far distant for in that particular
our adherents never neglect their duty suppose
it come therefore and that thy father as
must be course becomes an earl and one 
the privy council odd's fish man i shall be as
much afraid him as ever was my grandfather
henri quatre old sully imagine there were
such a trinket now about the court as the fair
rosamond or la belle gabrielle what a work
there would be pages and grooms the cham
to get the pretty rogue clandestinely shuffled
out by the backstairs like a prohibited commodity
when the step the earl woodstock was
heard in the antechamber v
i am glad to see your majesty so merry after
your fatiguing journey
the fatigue was nothing man said charles
a kind welcome and a good meal made amends
woodstock 
for all that but they must have suspected thee 
bringing a wolf from the braes badcnoch along
with you instead a twolegged being with no
more than the usual allowance mortal stowage
for provisions i was really ashamed my appetite
 but thou knowest i had eat nothing for
twentyfour hours save the raw egg you stole forme
from the old woman's henroost i tell thee i
blushed to show myself so ravenous before that
high bred and respectable old gentleman your
father and the very pretty girl your sister or
cousin is she 
she is my sister said albert lee drily and
added in the same breath your majesty's appetite
suited well enough with the character a
raw northern lad would your majesty now
please to retire to rest 
not for a minute or two said the king retaining
his seat why man i have scarce had
my tongue unchained today and to talk with
that northern twang and besides the fatigue 
being obliged to speak every word in character 
gad it's like walking as the galley slaves do on
the continent with a twentyfourpound shot
g woodstock
chained to their legs they may drag it along
but they cannot move with comfort and by the
way thou art slack in paying me my welldeserved
tribute compliments on my counterfeiting
did i not play louis kerneguy as round as a
ring
 if your majesty asks my serious opinion perhaps
i may be forgiven if i say your dialect was
somewhat too coarse for a scottish youth high
birth and your behaviour perhaps a little too
churlish i thought too though i pretend not
to be skilful that some your scotch sounded
as if it were not genuinely
not genuine there is no pleasing thee albert
 why who should speak genuine scotch
but myself was i not their king for a matter
 ten months and if i did not get knowledge
 their language i wonder what else i got by
it did not east country and south country and
west country and highlands caw croak and
shriek about me as the deep guttural the broad
drawl and the high sharp yelp predominated by
turns odd's fish man have i not been speeches
woodstock j
at by their orators addressed by their senators rebuked
by their workmen have i not sate on the
cuttlestool mon again assuming the northern
dialect and thought it grace worthy mas john
gillespie that i was permitted to do penance in
mine own privy chamber instead the face the
congregation and wilt thou tell me after all that
i cannot speak scotch enough to bare an oxon
knight and his family 
may it please your majesty i began by
saying i was no judge the scottish language
pshaw it is mere envy just so you said at
norton's that i was too courteous and civil for a
young page now you think me too rude
 and there is a medium if one could find it
said albert defending his opinion in the same
tone in which the king attacked him so this
morning when you were in the woman's dress you
raised your petticoats rather unbecomingly high
as you waded through the first little stream and
when i told you it to mend the matter you
draggled through the next without raising them
at all
o the devil take the woman's dress said
 woodstock
charles i hope i shall never be driven to that
disguise again why my ugly face was enough
to put gowns caps and kirtles out fashion for
ever the very dogs fled from me had i passed
any hamlet that had but five huts in it i could
not have escaped the cuckingstool i was a libel
on womanhood these leathern conveniences are
none the gayest but they are propria que marius
 and right glad am i to be repossessed 
them i can tell you too my friend i shall resume
all my masculine privileges with my proper
habiliments and as you say i have been too
coarse tonight i will behave myself like a courtier
to mistress alice tomorrow i made a sort
 acquaintance with her already when i seemed
to be the same sex with herself and found out
there are other colonels in the wind besides you
colonel albert lee
may it please your majesty said albert 
and then stopped short from the difficulty 
finding words to express the unpleasant nature 
his feelings they could not escape charles but
he proceeded without scruple i pique myself
on seeing as far into the hearts young ladies
woodstock 
as most folks though god knows they are sometimes
too deep for the wisest us but i mentioned
to your sister in my character fortuneteller 
thinking poor simple man that a country girl must
have no one but her brother to dream about 
that she was anxious about a certain colonel i
had hit the theme but not the person for i alluded
to you albert and i presume the blush
was too deep ever to be given to a brother so up
she got and away she flew from me like a lapwing
i can excuse her for looking at myself in the well
i think if i had met such a creature as i seemed
i should have called fire and faggot against it 
now what think you albert who can this colonel
be that more than rivals you in your sister's
affection 
albert who well knew that the king's mode 
thinking where the fair sex was concerned was
far more gay than delicate endeavoured to put a
stop to the present topic by a grave answer
his sister he said had been in some measure
educated with the son her maternal uncle
markham everard but as his father and he himself
had adopted the cause the roundheads the
 woodstock
families had in consequence been at variance and
any projects which might have been formerly entertained
were course long since dismissed on
all sides
you are wrong albert you are wrong said
the king pitilessly pursuing his jest you colonels
whether you wear blue or orange sashes
are too pretty fellows to be dismissed so easily
when once you have acquired an interest but
mistress alice so pretty and who wishes the restoration
 the king with such a look and accent
as if she were an angel whose prayers must
needs bring it down must not be allowed to retain
any thoughts a canting roundhead what
say you will you give me leave to take her to
task about it after all i am the party most
concerned in maintaining true allegiance among
tiny subjects and if i gain the pretty maidens
good will that the sweethearts will soon follow
this was jolly king edward's way edward the
fourth you know the kingmaking earl warwick
 the cromwell his day dethroned him
more than once but he had the hearts the
hi
woodstock h
merry dames london and the purses and veins
 the cockneys bled freely till they brought him
home again how say you shall i shake off my
northern slough and speak with alice in my own
character showing what education and manners
have done for me to make the best amends they
can for an ugly face 
may it please your majesty said albert in
an altered and embarrassed tone i did not expect

here he stopped not able to find words adequate
at the same time to express his sentiments
and respectful enough to the king while in this
father's house and under his own protection
and what is it that master lee does not expect
 said charles with marked gravity on his
part
again albert attempted a reply but advanced
no farther than i would hope if it please your
majesty when he again stopped short his deep
and hereditary respect for his sovereign and his
sense the hospitality due to his misfortunes
preventing his giving utterance to this irritated
feelings
vol q
 woodstock
and what does colonel albert lee hope 
said charles in the same dry and cold manner in
which he had before spoken no answer 
now hope that colonel lee does not see in a
silly jest anything offensive to the honour his
family since methinks that were an indifferent
compliment to his sister his father and himself
not to mention charles stuart whom he calls his
king and expect that i shall not be so hardly
construed as to be supposed capable forgetting
that mistress auce lee is the daughter my
faithful subject and host and the sister my
guide and preserver come come albert he
added changing at once to his naturally frank and
unceremonious manner you forget how long i
have been abroad where men women and children
talk gallantry morning noon and night
with no more serious thought than just to pass
away the time and i forget too that you are 
the oldfashioned english school a son after sir
henry's own heart and don't understand raillery
upon such subjects but i ask your pardon
albert sincerely if i have really hurt you
so saying he extended his hand to colonel lee
woodstock sii
who feeling he had been really too hasty in construing
the king's jest in an unpleasant sense kissed
it with reverence and attempted an apology
not a word not a word said the goodnatured
prince raising his penitent adherent as he
attempted to kneel we understand each other
you are somewhat afraid the gay reputation
which i acquired in scotland but i assure you i
will be as stupid as you or your cousin colonel
could desire in presence mrs alice lee and
only bestow my gallantry should i have any to
throw away upon the pretty little waitingmaid
who attended at supper unless you should have
monopolized her ear for your own benefit colonel
albert
it is monopolized sure enough though not by
me if it please your majesty but by joceline 
underkeeper whom we must not disoblige
as we have trusted him so far already and may
have occasion to repose even entire confidence in
him i half think he suspects who louis kern
may in reality be
you are an engrossing set you wooers 
woodstock said the king laughing now
 woodstock
if i had a fancy as a frenchman would not fail
to have in such a case to make pretty speeches
to the deaf old woman i saw in the kitchen as a
pisaller i dare say i should be told that tier ear
was engrossed for dr rochecliffe's sole use 
i marvel at your majesty's good spirits
said albert that after a day danger fatigue
and accidents you should feel the power amusing
yourself thus
that is to say the groom the chambers
wishes his majesty would go to sleep well one
word or two on more serious business and i have
done i have been completely directed by you
and rochecliffe i have changed my disguise
from female to male upon the instant and altered
my destination from hampshire to take shelter
here do you still hold it the wiser course 
i have great confidence in dr rochecliffe
replied albert whose acquaintance with the
scattered royalists enables him to gain the most
accurate intelligence his pride in the extent 
his correspondence and the complication his
plots and schemes for your majesty's service is indeed
the very food he lives upon but his sagacity
woodstock 
is equal to this vanity i repose besides the utmost
faith in joiiffe my father and sister i
would say nothing yet i would not without reason
extend the knowledge your majesty's person
farther than it is indispensably necessary
is it handsome in me said charles pausing
to withhold my full confidence from sir henry
lee r
your majesty heard his almost deathswoon
 last night what would agitate him most
deeply must noi be hastily communicated
true but are we safe from a visit the
redcoats they have them in woodstock as well
as in oxford said charles
dr rochecliffe says not unwisely answered
lee that it is best sitting near the fire when the
chimney smokes and that woodstock so lately in
possession the sequestrated and in the vicinity
 the soldiers will be less suspected and more
carelessly searched than more distant corners
which might seem to promise more safety besides
he added rochecliffe is in possession 
curious and important news concerning the state
 matters at woodstock highly favourable to your
woodstock
majesty's being concealed in the palace for two or
three days till shipping is provided the parliament
or usurping council state had sent
down sequestrated whom their own evil consciences
assisted perhaps by the tricks some daring
cavaliers had frightened out the lodge without
much desire to come back again then the
more formidable usurper cromwell had granted
a warrant possession to colonel everard who
had only used it for the purpose repossessing
his uncle in the lodge and who kept watch in
person at the little borough to see that sir henry
was not disturbed
what mistress alice's colonel said the
king that sounds alarming for grant that
he keeps the other fellows at bay think you not
master albert he will not have an hundred errands
aday to bring him here in person p
dr rochecuffe says answered lee the
treaty between sir henry and his nephew binds
the latter not to approach the lodge unless invited
 indeed it was not without great difficulty
and strongly arguing the good consequences it
might produce to your majesty's cause that my
woodstock ji
father could be prevailed on to occupy woodstock
at all but be assured he will be in no hurry to
send an invitation to the colonel
and be you assured that the colonel will come
without waiting for one said charles folks
cannot judge rightly where sisters are concerned
they are too familiar with the magnet to judge
 its powers attraction everard will be here
as if drawn by cartropes fetters not to talk 
promises will not hold him and then methinks
we are in some danger
i hope not said albert in the first
place i know markham is a slave to his word besides
were any chance to bring him here i think
i could pass your majesty upon him without difficulty
as louis kerneguy then although my
cousin and i have not been at one for these some
years i believe him incapable betraying your
majesty and lastly if i saw the least danger 
it i would were he ten times my mother's nephew
run my sword through his body ere he
had time to execute his purpose
there is but another question said charles
and i will release you albert you seem to
 woodstock
think yourself secure from search it may be so 
but in any other country this tale goblins
which is flying about would bring down priests
and ministers justice to examine the reality 
the stormy and mobs idle people to satisfy their
curiosity
 respecting the first sir we hope and understand
that colonel everard's influence will prevent
any immediate inquiry for the sake preserving
undisturbed the peace his uncle's family
 and as for any one coming without some sort
 authority the whole neighbours have much
love and fear my father and are besides so
horribly alarmed about the goblins woodstock
that fear will silence curiosity
on the whole then said charles the
chances safety seem to be in favour the plan
we have adopted which is all i can hope for in a
condition where absolute safety is out the question
the bishop recommended dr rochechffe as
one the most ingenious boldest and most loyal
sons the church england you albert lee
have marked your fidelity by a hundred proofs
to you and your local knowledge i submit mywoodstock

self and now prepare our arms alive i will
not be taken yet i will not believe that a son
 the king england and heir her throne
could be destined to danger in his own palace
and under the guard the loyal lees
albert lee laid pistols and swords in readiness
by the king's bed and his own and charles
after some slight apology took his place in the
large and better bed with a sigh pleasure as
from one who had not lately enjoyed such an indulgence
he bid good night to his faithful attendant
who deposited himself in his truckle and
both monarch and subject were soon fast asleep
 woodto k
chapter x
give sir nicholas throlkeld praise 
hear it good man old in days
thou tree succour and rest
to this young bird that was distress'd 
beneath thy branches he did stay 
and he was free to sport and play
when falcons were abroad for prey
wordsworth
the fugitive prince slept in spite danger
with the profound repose which youth and fatigue
inspire but the young cavalier his guide and
guardsmen a more restless night starting from
time to time and listening anxious notwithstanding
doctor rochccliffes assurances to procure yet
more particular knowledge concerning the state
 things around them than he had been yet able
to collect
he arose early after daybreak but although
he moved with as little noise as was possible the
woodstock 
slumbers the haunted prince were easily disturbed
he started up in his bed and asked if
there was any alarm
none please your majesty replied lee 
only thinking on the questions your majesty
was asking last night and the various chances
there are your majesty's safety being endangered
from unforeseen accidents i thought 
going thus early both to communicate with doctor
rochecliffe and to keep such a lookout as
befits the place where are lodged for the time the
fortunes england i fear i must request 
your majesty for your own gracious security
that you have the goodness to condescend to secure
the door with your own hand after i go out
oh talk not to majesty for heaven's sake
dear albert answered the poor king endeavouring
in vain to put a part his clothes in order
to traverse the room when a king's doublet
and hose are so ragged that he can no more find
his way into them than he could have travelled
through the forest deane without a guide good
faith there should be an majesty until it
chances to be better accommodated besides there
 woodstock
is the chance these big words bolting out at
unawares when there are ears to hear them whom
we might think dangerous
your commands shall be obeyed said lee
who had now succeeded in opening the door from
which he took his departure leaving the king
who had hustled along the floor for that purpose
with his dress woefully ill arranged to make it fast
again behind him and begging his majesty in no
case to open to any one unless he or rochecliffe
were the party who summoned him
albert then set out in quest doctor s
apartment which was only known to himself
and the faithfuljoliffe and had at different times
accommodated that steady churchman with a place
 concealment when from his bold and busy temper
which led him into the most extensive and
hazardous machinations on the king's behalf he
had been strictly sought after by the opposite party
 late the inquest after him had died entirely
away as he had prudently withdrawn himself
from the scene his intrigues since the loss 
the battle worcester he had been afloat again
and more active than ever and had by friends
woodstock 
and correspondents and especially the bishop 
been the means directing the king's flight
towards woodstock although it was not until the
very day his arrival that he could promise him
a safe reception at that ancient mansion
albert lee though he revered both the undaunted
spirit and ready resources the bustling
and undertaking churchman felt he had not been
enabled by him to answer some the king's questions
yesternight in a way so distinct as one trusted
with the king's safety ought to have done and
it was now his object to make himself personally
acquainted if possible with the various bearings
 so weighty a matter as became a man on whom 
so much the responsibility wa likely to descend
even his local knowledge was scarce adequate
to find the doctor's secret apartment had he not
traced his way after a genial flavour roasted
game through divers blind passages and up and
down certain very useless stairs through cupboards
and hatchways and so forth to a species
 sanctum sanatorium where joceline joliffe
was ministering to the good doctor a solemn
breakfast wildfowl with a cup small beer
 woodstock
stirred with a sprig rosemary which doctor
rochecliffe preferred to all strong potations beside
him sat bevis on his tail slobbering and looking
amiable moved by the rare smell the breakfast
which had quite overcome his native dignity
 disposition
the chamber in which the doctor had established
himself was a little octangular room with walls
 great thickness within which were fabricated
various issues leading in different directions and
communicating with different parts the building
around him were packages with arms and near
him one small barrel as it seemed gunpowder
 many papers in different parcels and several
keys for correspondence in cypher two or three
scrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also beside
him which albert took for plans nativity and
various models machinery in which doctor
rochecliffe was an adept there were also tools
 various kinds masks cloaks and a dark lantern
and a number other indescribable trinkets
belonging to the trade a daring plotter
in dangerous times last there was a casket
with gold and silver coin different countries
woodstock 
which was left carelessly open as if it were the
least doctor rochecliffes concern although
his habits in general announced narrow circumstances
if not actual poverty close by the divine's
plate lay a bible and prayerbook with some
proof sheets as they are technically called seemingly
fresh from the press there was also within
the reach his hand a dirk or scottish poniard
a powderhorn and a musketoon or blunderbuss
with a pair handsome pocketpistols in the
midst this miscellaneous collection the doctor
sat eating his breakfast with great appetite as
little dismayed by the various implements danger
around him as a workman is when accustomed
to the perils a gunpowder manufactory
soh young gentleman he said getting up
and extending his hand are you come to breakfast
with me in good fellowship or to spoil my
meal this morning as you did my supper last
night by asking untimely questions 
i will pick a bone with you with all my
heart said albert and if you please doctor
i would ask some questions which seem not
quite untimely
 woodstock
so saying he sat down and assisted the doctor
in giving a very satisfactory account a brace
 wild ducks and a leash teal bevis who
maintained his place with great patience and insinuation
had his share a collop which was also
placed on the wellfurnished board for like most
highbred dogs he declined eating waterfowl
come hither then albert lee said the
doctor laying down his knife and fork and plucking
the towel from his throat so soon as joceline
was withdrawn thou art still the same lad thou
wert when i was thy tutor never satisfied with
having got a grammar rule but always persecuting
me with questions why the rule stood so and not
otherwise over curious after information which
thou could'st not comprehend as bevis hungered
and whined for the duckwing which he could not
eat
i hope you will find me more reasonable
doctor answered albert and at the same
time that you will recollect i am not now stibjh
rtda but am placed in circumstances where i am
not at liberty to act upon the ipse dixit any
wooitoic 
man unless my own judgment be convinced 
shall deserve richly to be hanged drawn and
quartered should any misfortune happen by my
misgovernment in this business
and it is therefore albert that i would
have thee trust the whole to me without interfering
thou mayest forsooth thou art not sub ferula
 but recollect that while you have been fighting
in the field i have been plotting in the study
that i know all the combinations the king's
friends ay and all the motions his enemies as
well as a spider knows every mesh his web
think my experience man not a cavalier in
the land but has heard rochecliite the plotter
i have been a main limb in everything that has
been attempted since fortytwo penned declarations
conducted correspondence communicated
with chiefs recruited followers commissioned
arms levied money appointed rendezvous i was
in the western rising and before that in the
city petition and in sir john owen's stir in
wales in short almost in every plot for the king
since tomkins and challenger's matter
but were not all these plots unsuccessful 
vol r
 woodstock
gait albert and were not tomkins and challenger
hanged doctor 
yes my young friend answered the doctor
gravely as many others have been with whom
i have acted but only because they did not follow
my advice implicitly you never heard that i
was hanged myself
the time may come doctor said albert 
the pitcher goes oft to the well the proverb
as my father would say is somewhat musty but
i too have some confidence in my own judgement
 and much as i honour the church i cannot
altogether subscribe to passive obedience i
will tell you in one word what points i must have
explanation on and it will remain with you to
give it or to return a message to the king that
you will not explain your plan in which case if
he acts by my advice he will leave woodstock
and resume his purpose getting to the coast
without delay
well then thou suspicious monster make
thy demands and if they be such as i can answer
without betraying confidence i will reply to
them
woodstock 
 in the first place then what is all this story
about ghosts and witchcraft and apparitions 
and do you consider it as safe for his majesty to
stay in a house subject to such visitations real or
pretended 
you must be satisfied with my answer in verba
sacerdotal the circumstances you allude to will
not give the least annoyance to woodstock during
the king's residence i cannot explain farther
 but for this i will be bound at the risk 
my neck
then said lee we must take the doctor
for bail that the devil will keep the peace towards
our sovereign lord the king good now there
lurked about this house the greater part yesterday
and perhaps slept here a fellow called tompkins
 a bitter independent and a secretary or
something qr other to the regicide dog desborough
the man is well known a wild ranter
in religious opinions but in private affairs farsighted
cunning and interested even as any
rogue them all
be assured we will avail ourselves his crazy
fanaticism to mislead his wicked cunning s
woodstock
child may lead a hog if it has wit to fasten a cord
to the ring in its nose replied the doctor
you may be deceived said albert the
age has many such as this fellow whose views 
the spiritual and temporal world are so different
that they resemble the eyes a squinting man 
one which oblique and distorted sees nothing
but the his nose while the other instead 
partaking the same defect views strongly sharply
and acutely whatever is subjected to its scrutiny
but we will put a patch on the better eye
said the doctor and he shall only be allowed to
speculate with the imperfect optic you must
know this fellow has always seen the greatest
number and the most hideous apparitions he
has not the courage a cat in such matters
though stout enough when he hath temporal antagonists
before him i have placed him under
the charge joceline joliffe who betwixt plying
him with sack and ghoststories would make
him incapable knowing what was done if you
were to proclaim the king in his presence
but why keep such a fellow here at all 
oh sir content you he lies leaguer as a
woodstock 
sort ambassador for his worthy masters and
we are secure from any intrusion so long as they
get all the news woodstock from trusty tompkins

i know joceline's honesty well said albert 
and if he can assure me that he will keep a
watch over this fellow i will so far trust in him
he does not know the depth the stake tis
true but that my life is concerned will be quite
enough to keep him vigilant well then i proceed
 what if markham everard comes down
til
on us r
we have his word to the contrary answered
rochecliife his word honour transmitted
by his friend do you think it likely he will
break it r
i hold him incapable doing so answered
albert andbesides i think markham would
make no bad use anything which might come
to his knowledge yet god forbid we should be
under the necessity trusting any who ever wore
the parliament's colours in a matter such dear
concernment 
amen said the doctor are your doubts
silenced now 
 woodstock
i still have an objection said albert to
yonder impudent rakehelly fellow styling himself
a cavalier who pushed himself on our company
last night and gained my father's heart by
a story the storm brentford which i daresay
the rogue never saw
you mistake him dear albert roger wildrake
although till late i only knew him byname
is a gentleman was bred at the inns 
court and spent his estate in the king's service
or rather in the devil's service said albert
it is such fellows as he who sunk from the license
 their military habits into idle debauched
ruffians infest the land with riots and robberies
brawl in hedge alehouses and cellars where strong
waters are sold at midnight and with their deep
oaths their hot loyalty and their drunken valour
make decent men abominate the very name
 cavalier
alas said the doctor it is but too true 
but what can you expect when the higher and
more qualified classes are broken down and mingled
undistinguishable with the lower orders they are
apt to lose the most valuable marks their quawoodstock

city in the general confusion morals and manners
 just as a handful silver medals will become
defaced and discoloured if jumbled about
among the vulgar copper coin even the prime
medal all which we royalists would so willingly
wear next our very hearts has not perhaps entirely
escaped some deterioration but let other
tongues than mine speak on that subject
albert lee paused deeply after having heard
these communications on the part rochecliffe
 doctor he said it is generally agreed
even by some who think you may occasionally
have been a little over busy in putting men upon
dangerous actions 
may god forgive them who entertain so
false an opinion me said the doctor
that nevertheless you have done and
suffered more in the king's behalf than any man
 your function
they do me but justice there said doctor
rochecliffe absolute justice
i am therefore disposed to abide by your
opinion if all things considered you think it
safe that we should remain at woodstock
 woodstock
that is not the question answered the
divine
and what is the question then replied the
young soldier
whether any safer course can be pointed
out i grieve to say that the question must be
comparative as to the point option absolute
safety is alas the while out the question on
all sides now i say woodstock is fenced and
guarded as at present by far the most preferable
place concealment
enough i give up to you the question as
to a person whose knowledge such important
affairs not to mention your age and experience is
more intimate and extensive than mine can be
you do well answered rochecliffe and
if others had acted with the like distrust their
own knowledge and confidence in competent persons
it had been better for the age this makes
understanding bar himself up within his fortalice
and wit betake himself to his high tower here
he looked around his cell with an air selfcomplacence
 the wise man foreteeth the tempest
and lieth himsclk
woodstock 
doctor said albert let our foresight serve
others far more precious than either us let
me ask you if you have well considered whether
our precious charge should remain in society with
the family or betake himself to some the more
hidden corners the house 
hum i think he will be safest as louis
kerneguy keeping himself close beside you 
i fear it will be necessary that i scout abroad
a little and show myself in some distant part 
the country lest coming here in quest me
they should find higher game
pray do not interrupt me keeping himself
close beside you or your father in or near to
victor lee's apartment from which you are aware
he can make a ready escape should danger approach
 this occurs to me as best for the present
 i hope to hear the vessel today tomorrow
at farthest
albert lee bid the active but opinionated man
good morrow admiring how this species intrigue
had become a sort element in which the
doctor seemed to enjoy himself notwithstanding
all that the poet has said concerning the horrors
fi woodstock
which intervene betwixt the conception and execution
 a conspiracy
in returning from doctor rochecliffe's sanctuary
he met with eocene who was anxiously seeking
him the young scotch gentleman he said
in a mysterious manner has arisen from bed
and hearing me pass he called me into his apartment

well replied albert i will see him presently

and he asked me for fresh linen and clothes
now sir he is like a man who is quite accustomed
to be obeyed so i gave him a suit which happened
to be in a wardrobe in the west tower and
some your linen to conform and when he was
dressed he commanded me to show him to the
presence sir henry lee and my young lady
i would have said something sir about waiting
till you came back but he pulled me goodnaturedly
by the hair as indeed he has a rare
humour his own and told me he was guest to
master albert lee and not his prisoner so
sir though i thought you might be displeased
withme for giving him the means stirring
woodstock 
abroad and perhaps being seen by those who
should not see him what could i say 
you are a sensible fellow joceline and
comprehend always what is recommended to you
this youth will not be controlled i fear
by either us but we must look the closer
after his safety you keep your watch over that
prying fellow the steward 
trust him to my care on that side have no
fear but ah sir i would we had the young
scot in his old clothes again for the ridingsuit
 yours which he now wears hath set him off in
otherguess fashion
from the manner in which the faithful dependent
expressed himself albert saw that he suspected
who the scottish page in reality was yet
he did not think it proper to acknowledge to
him a fact such importance secure as he was
equally his fidelity whether explicitly trusted
to the full extent or left to his own conjectures
full anxious thought he went to the apartment
 victor lee in which joliife told him he
would find the party assembled the sound 
laughter as he laid his hand on the lock the
 woodstock
door almost made him start so singularly did it
jar with the doubtful and melancholy reflections
which engaged his own mind he entered and
found his father in high good humour laughing
and conversing freely with his young charge whose
appearance was indeed so much changed to the
better in externals that it seemed scarce possible
a night's rest a toilette and a suit decent
clothes could have done so much in his favour in
so short a time it could not however be imputed
to the mere alteration dress although that no
doubt had its effect there was nothing splendid
in that which louis kerneguy we continue to call
him by his assumed name now wore it was
merely a ridingsuit grey cloth with seme silver
lace in the fashion a country gentleman 
the time but it happened to fit him very welland
to become his very dark complexion especially
as he now held up his head and used the
manners not only a wellbehaved but a 
gentleman when he moved
his clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged fora
sort shuffle which as it might be the consequence
 a wound in those perilous times had
woodstock 
rather an interesting than an ungainly effect at
least it was as genteel an expression that the party
had been overheard travelled as the most polite
pedestrian could propose to himself
the features the wanderer were harsh as
ever but his red shock peruke for such it proved
was laid aside his sable elflocks were trained
by a little joceline's assistance into curls and
his fine black eyes shone from among the shade
 these curls and corresponded with the animated
though not handsome character the whole
head in his conversation he had laid aside
all the coarseness dialect which he had so
strongly affected on the preceding evening and
although he continued to speak a little scotch
for the support his character as a young gentleman
 that nation yet it was not in a degree
which either rendered his speech uncouth
or unintelligible but merely afforded a certain
doric tinge essential to the personage he represented
no person on earth could better understand
the society in which he moved exile had
made him acquainted with life in all its shades
and varieties his spirits if not uniform were
 woodstock
elastic he had that species epicurean philosophy
which even in the most extreme difficulties
and dangers can in an interval ease avail
itself the enjoyments the moment he was
in short in youth and misfortune as afterwards
in his regal condition a goodhumoured but hardhearted
voluptuary wise save where his passions
intervened beneficent save when prodigality
had deprived him the means or prejudice 
the wish to confer benefits his faults such as
might often have drawn down hatred but that
they were mingled with so much urbanity that
the injured person felt it impossible to retain the
full sense his wrongs
albert lee found the party consisting his
father sister and the supposed page seated by
the breakfast table at which he also took his
place he was a pensive and anxious beholder
 what passed while the page who had already
completely gained the heart the good old cavalier
by mimicking the manner in which the
scotch divines preached in favour ma gude
lord marquis argyle and the solemn league
and covenant was now endeavouring to interest
woodstock j
the fair alice by such anecdotes partly warlike
and perilous adventure as possessed the same degree
 interest for the female ear which they have
had ever since desdemona's days but it was not
only dangers by land and sea that the disguised
page spoke but much more and much oftener on
foreign revels banquets balls where the pride 
france spain or the low countries was exhibited
in the eyes their most eminent beauties
alice being a very young girl who in consequence
 the civil war had been almost entirely educated
in the country and often in great seclusion
it was certainly no wonder that she should listen
with willing ears and a ready smile to what the
young gentleman their guest and her brother's protege
told with so much gaiety and mingled with
such a shade dangerous adventure and occasionally
 serious reflection as prevented the discourse
from being regarded as merely light and frivolous
in a word sir henry lee laughed alice
smiled from time to time and au were well satisfied
but albert who would himself however have
been scarce able to allege a sufficient reason for
his depression spirits
 woodstock
the materials breakfast were at last removed
under the active superintendence the neathanded
phoebe who looked over her shoulder
and lingered more than once to listen to the
fluent discourse their new guest whom on the
preceding evening she had while in attendance
at supper accounted one the most stupid inmates
to whom the gates woodstock had been
opened since the times fair rosamond
louis kerneguy then when they were left only
four in the chamber without the interruption 
domestics and the successive bustle occasioned by
the discussion and removal the morning meal
became apparently sensible that his friend and
ostensible patron albert ought not altogether to
be suffered to drop to leeward in the conversation
while he was himself successfully engaging
the attention those members his family to
whom he had become so recently known he went
behind his chair therefore and leaning on the
back said with a goodhumoured tone which
made his purpose entirely intelligible
either my good friend guide and patron has
heard worse news this morning than he cares to
woods rock 
tell us or he must liavo stumbled over my tattered
jerkin and leathern hose and acquired by
contact the whole mass stupidity which i threw
off last night with those most dolorous garments
cheer up my dear colonel albert if your affectionate
page may presume to say so you are in
company with those whose society dear to strangers
must be doubly so to you odd's fish man
cheer up i have seen you gay on a biscuit and
a mouthful watercresses don't let your heart
fail you on rhenish wine and venison
dear louis said albert rousing himself
into exertion and somewhat ashamed his own
silence i heave slept worse and been astir earlier
than you
be it so said his father yet i hold it no
good excuse for your sullen silence albert you
have met your sister and me so long separated
from you so anpious on your behalf almost like
mere strangers and yet you are returned safe tous
and you find us well
returned indeed but for safety my dear
father that word must be a stranger to us wore

cestcr folks for some time however it is not my
own safety about which i am anxious
 abovit whose then should you be anxious
all accounts agree that the king is safe out 
the dogs jaws
not without some danger though muttered
louis thinking his encounter with bevis on
the preceding evening
no not without danger echoed the knight 
 but as old avill says 
there's such divinity doth hedje a king
that treason dares not peep at what it would
no no thank god that's cared for our hope
and fortune is escaped so all news affirm escaped
from bristol if i thought otherwise albert
i should be as sad as you are for the rest it
i have lurked a month in this house when discovery
would have been death and that is no longer
since than after lord holland and the duke 
buckingham's rising at kingston and hang me
if i thought once twisting my brow into such
ft tragic fold as yours but cocked my hat at misfortune
as a cavalier should
 if i might put in a word said louis it
woodstock g
would be to assure colonel albert lee that i
verily believe the king would think his own hap
wherever he may be much the worse that his best
subjects were seized with dejection on his account
you answer boldly on the king's part young
man said sir henry
oh my father was meikle about the king's
hand answered louis recollecting his present
character
no wonder then said sir henry that
you have so soon recovered your good spirits and
good breeding when you heard his majesty's
escape why you are no more like the lad we
saw last night than the best hunter i ever had was
like a drayhorse
oh there is much in rest and food and
grooming answered louis you would hardly
know the tired jade you dismounted from last
night when she is brought out prancing and neighing
the next morning rested refreshed and ready
to start again especially if the brute hath some
good blood for such pick up unco fast
well then but since thy father was a courtier
and thou hast learned i think something rvf
 woodstock
the trade tell us a little master kerneguy about
him we love most to hear about the king we are
all safe and secret you need not be afraid he
was a hopeful youth i trust his flourishing blossom
now gives promise fruit 
as the knight spoke louis bent his eyes on
the ground and seemed at first uncertain what to
answer but admirable at extricating himself from
such dilemmas he replied that he really could
not presume to speak on such a subject in the
presence his patron colonel albert lee who
must be a much better judge the character 
king charles than he could pretend to be
albert was accordingly next assailed by the
knight seconded by alice for some account 
his majesty s character
i will speak but according to facts said
albert and then i must be acquitted partiality
if the king had not possessed enterprise
and military skill he never would have attempted
the expedition to worcester had he not had
personal courage he had not so long disputed the
battle that cromwell almost judged it lost that
he possesses prudence and patience must be arwoodstock

gucd from the circumstances attending his flight 
and that he has the love his subjects is evident
since necessarily known to many he has been betrayed
by none
for shame albert replied his sister is
that the way a good cavalier doles out the character
 his prince applying an instance at every
concession like a pedlar measuring linen with his
rod out upon you no wonder you were beaten
if you fought as coldly for your king as yoi
now talk for him
i did my best to trace a likeness from what i
have seen and known the original sister alice
replied her brother if you would have a fancy
portrait you must get an artist more imagination
than i have to draw it for you
i will be that artist myself said alice and
in my portrait our monarch shall show all that he
ought to be having such high pretensions all
that he must be being so loftily descended all
that i am sure he is and that every loyal heart
in the kingdom ought to believe him
 well said alice quoth the old knight
 woodstock
look thou upon this picture and on this 
here is our young friend shall judge i wager my
best nag that is i would wager him had i one
left that alice proves the better painter the
two my son's brain is still misty i think since
his defeat he has not got the smoke worcester
out it plague on thee a young man and
cast down for one beating had you been banged
twenty times like me it had been time to look
grave but come alice forward the colours are
mixed on your pallet forward with something
that shall show like one vandyke's living portraits
placed beside the dull dry presentation
there our ancestor victor lee
alice it must be observed had been educated
by her father in the notions high and even exaggerated
loyalty which characterized the cavaliers
and she was really an enthusiast in the royal
cause but besides she was in good spirits at her
brother's happy return and wished to prolong
the gay humour in which her father had late
scarcely ever indulged
well then she said though i am no apel
woodstock q
les i will try to paint an alexander such as i
hope and am determined to believe exists in the
person our exiled sovereign soon i trust to
be restored and i will not go farther than his
own family he shall have all the chivalrous
courage all the warlike skill henry france
his grandfather in order to place him on the
throne all his benevolence love his people
patience even unpleasing advice sacrifice 
his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal
that seated there he may be blest while living
and so long remembered when dead that for ages
after it shall be thought sacrilege to breathe an
aspersion against the throne which he has occupied
 long after he is dead while there remains
an old man who has seen him were the condition
 that survivor no higher than a groom or a
menial his age shall be provided for at the public
charge and his gray hairs regarded with more
distinction than an ears coronet because he remembers
the second charles the monarch 
every heart in england 
while alice spoke she was hardly conscious
 the presence any one save her father and
 woodstock
brother for the page withdrew himself somewhat
from the circle and there was nothing to remind
her him she gave the reins therefore to her
enthusiasm and as the tears glittered in her eye
and her beautiful features became animated she
seemed like a descended cherub proclaiming the
virtues a patriot monarch the person chiefly
interested in her description held himself back as
we have said and concealed his own features yet
so as to preserve a full view the beautiful
speaker
albert lee conscious in whose presence this
eulogium was pronounced was much embarrassed
 but his father all whose feelings were flattered
by the panegyric was in rapture
so much for the king alice he said and
now for the mem
for the man replied alice in the same tone
need wish him more than the paternal virtues
 his unhappy father whom his worst enemies
have recorded that if moral virtues and religious
faith were to be selected as the qualities which
merited a crown no man could plead the possession
 them in a higher or more indisputable dcwoodstock

grec temperate wise and frugal yet munificent
in rewarding merit a friend to letters and
the muses but a severe discourager the misuse
 such gifts a worthy gentleman a kind master
 the best friend the best father the best
christian her voice began to falter and
her father's handkerchief was already at his eyes
he was girl he was exclaimed sir henry 
but no more on't i charge ye no more on't
enough let his son but possess his virtues with
better advisers and better fortunes and he will
be all that england in her warmest wishes could
desire
there was a pause after this for alice felt as
if she had spoken too frankly and too zealously
for her sex and youth sir henry was occupied
in melancholy recollections on the fate his late
sovereign while kerneguy and his supposed patron
felt embarrassed perhaps from a consciousness
that the real charles fell far short his ideal
character as designed in such glowing colours in
some cases exaggerated or inappropriate praise
becomes the most severe satire
 woodstock
but such reflections were not a nature to belong
willingly cherished by the person to whom
they might have been great advantage he assumed
a tone raillery which is perhaps the
readiest mode escaping from the feelings selfreproof
 every cavalier he said should
bend his knee to thank mistress alice lee for
having made such a flattering portrait the king
their master by laying under contribution for his
benefit the virtues all his ancestors only there
was one point he would not have expected a female
painter to have passed over in silence when she
made him in right his grandfather and father
a muster royal and individual excellencies why
could she not have endowed him at the same time
with his mother's personal charms why should
not the son henrietta maria the finest woman
 her day add the recommendations a
handsome face and figure to his internal e
vxl u
 woodstock
come very imminent he was glad therefore 
comparative repose and comparative safety
then it must be considered that charles had
been entirely reconciled to the society at woodstock
since he had become better acquainted with
it he had seen that to interest the beautiful
alice and procure a great deal her company
nothing more was necessary than to submit to the
humours and cultivate the intimacy the old
cavalier her father a few bouts at fencing in
which charles took care not to put out his more
perfect skill and full youthful strength and activity
 the endurance a few scenes from shakspeare
which the knight read with more zeal than
taste a little skill in music in which the old
man had been a proficient the deference paid to
a few oldfashioned opinions at which he laughed
in his sleeve were allsufficient to gain for the
disguised prince an interest in sir henry lee
and to conciliate in an equal degree the goodwill
 his lovely daughter
never were two young persons who could be
said to commence this species intimacy with
such unequal advantages charles was a liberwoodstock

tine who if he did not in cold blood resolve upon
prosecuting his passion for auce to a dishonourable
conclusion was at every moment liable
to be provoked to attempt the strength a virtue
in which he was no believer then auce on her
part hardly knew even what was implied by the
word libertine or seducer her mother had died
early in the commencement the civil war and
she had been bred up chiefly with her brother and
cousin so that she had an unfearing and unsuspicious
frankness manner upon which charles
was not unwilling or unlikely to put a construction
favourable to his own views even alice's
love for her cousin the first sensation which
awakens the most innocent and simple mind to
feelings shyness and restraint towards the male
sex in general had failed to awaken such an
alarm in her bosom they were nearly related 
and everard though young was several years
her elder and had from her infancy been an
object her respect as well as her affection
when this early and childish intimacy ripened
into youthful love confessed and returned still
it differed in some shades from the passion exists
woodstock
ing between lovers originally strangers to each
other until their affections have been united in the
ordinary course courtship their love was
fonder more familiar more perfectly confidential 
purer too perhaps and more free from starts 
passionate violence or apprehensive jealousy
the possibility that any one could have attempted
to rival everard in her affection was a
circumstance which never occurred to alice and
that this singular scottish lad whom she laughed
with on account his humour and laughed
at for his peculiarities should be an object 
danger or caution never once entered her
imagination the sort intimacy to which she
admitted kerneguy was the same to which she
would have received a companion her own sex
whose manners she did not always approve but
whose society she found amusing
it was natural that the freedom alice lee's
conduct which arose from the most perfect indifference
should pass for something approaching
to encouragement in the royal gallant's apprehension
and that any resolutions he had formed
against being tempted to violate the hospitality
woodstock 
 woodstock should begin to totter as opportunities
for doing so became more frequent
these opportunities were favoured by albert's
departure from woodstock the very day after his
arrival it had been agreed in full council with
charles and rochecliffe that lee should go to
visit his uncle everard in the county kent
and by showing himself there should obviate
any cause suspicion which might arise from
his residence at woodstock and remove any pretext
for disturbing his father's family on account
 their harbouring one who had been so lately
in arms he had also undertaken at his own
great personal risk to visit different points on the
seacoast and ascertain the security different
places for providing shipping for the king's leaving
england
these circumstances were alike calculated to
procure the king's safety and facilitate his escape
but alice was thereby deprived the presence
 her brother who would have been her most
watchful guardian but who had set down the
king's light talk upon a former occasion to the
gaiety his humour and would have thought
 woodstock
he had done his sovereign great injustice had
he seriously suspected him such a breach 
hospitality as a dishonourable pursuit alice
would have implied
there were however two the household at
woodstock who appeared not so entirely reconciled
with louis kerneguy or his purposes the
one was bevis who seemed from their first unfriendly
rencontre to have kept up a pique against
their new guest which no advances on the part 
charles were able to soften if the page was
by chance left alone with his young mistress bevis
chose always to be the party came close
by alice's chair and growled audibly when the
gallant drew near her it is a pity said the
disguised prince that your bevis is not a bulldog
that we might dub him a roundhead at
once he is too handsome too noble too aristocratic
to nourish those inhospitable prejudices
against a poor houseless cavalier i am convinced
the spirit pym or hampden has transmigrated
into the rogue and continues to demonstrate
his hatred against royalty and all its adherents

wojstock 
alice would then reply that bevis was loyal
in word and deed and only partook her father's
prejudices against the scots which she could not
but acknowledge were tolerably strong
nay then said the supposed louis i
must find some other reason for i cannot allow
sir bevis's resentment to rest upon national antipathy
so we will suppose that some gallant
cavalier who wended to the wars and never returned
has adopted this shape to look back upon
the haunts he left so unwillingly and is jealous
at seeing even poor louis kerneguy drawing near
to the lady his lost affections he approached
her chair as he spoke and bevis gave one 
his deep growls
 in that case you had best keep your distance
said alice laughing for the bite a
dog possessed by the ghost a jealous lover
cannot be very safe and the king carried on
the dialogue in the same strain which while it
led alice to apprehend nothing more serious
than the apish gallantry a fantastic boy certainly
induced the supposed louis kerneguy to
think that he had made one those conquests
 woodstock
which often and easily fall to the share sovereigns
notwithstanding the acuteness his apprehension
he was not sufficiently aware that
the royal road to female favour is only open to
monarch s when they travel in grand costume and
that when they woo incognito their path courtship
is liable to the same windings and obstacles
which obstruct the course private individuals
there was besides bevis another member 
the family who kept a lookout upon louis
kerneguy and with no friendly eye phoebe
mayflower though her experience extended not
beyond the sphere the village yet knew the
world much better than her mistress and besides
she was five years older more knowing
she was more suspicious she thought that oddlooking
scotch boy made more up to her young
mistress than was proper for his condition 
life and moreover that alice gave him a little
more encouragement than parthenon would have
afforded to any such jackadandy in the absence
 aratus for the volume treating the
loves these celebrated arcadian was then the
woodstock 
favourite study swains and damsels throughout
merry england entertaining such suspicions
phoebe was at a loss how to conduct herself
on the occasion and yet resolved she would
not see the slightest chance the course colonel
everard's true love being obstructed without
attempting a remedy she had a peculiar
favour for markham herself and moreover he
was according to her phrase as handsome and
personable a young man as was in oxfordshire 
and this scotch scarecrow was no more to be
compared to him than chalk was to cheese and
yet she allowed that master girnigy had a wonderfully
welloiled tongue and that such gallants
were not to be despised what was to be done 
she had no facts to offer only vague suspicion 
and was afraid to speak to her mistress whose
kindness great as it was did not nevertheless
encourage familiarity
she sounded joceline but he was she knew
not why so deeply interested about this unlucky
lad and held this importance so high that she
could make no impression on him to speak
to the old knight would have been to raic a gc
 woodstock
neral tempest the worthy chaplain who was at
woodstock grand referee on all disputed matters
would have been the damsels most natural resource
for he was peaceful as well as moral by
profession and politic by practice but it happened
he had given phoebe unintentional offence
by speaking her under the classical epithet 
rustica fidele the which epithet as she understood
it not she held herself bound to resent as
contumelious and declaring she was not fonder 
a fiddle than other folks had ever since shunned
all intercourse with doctor rochecliffe which she
could easily avoid
master tomkins was always coming and going
about the house under various pretexts but he
was a roundhead and she was too true to the cavaliers
to introduce any the enemy as parties
to their internal discords besides he had talked
to phoebe herself in a manner which induced her
to decline everything in the shape familiarity
with him lastly cavaliers wildrake might have
been consulted but phoebe had her own reasons
for saying as she did with some emphasis that
cavaliers wildrake was an impudent london
woodstock 
rake at length she resolved to communicate
her suspicions to the party having most interest
in verifying or confuting them
i'll let master markham everard know that
there is a wasp buzzing about his honeycombs
said phoebe and moreover that i know that
this young scotch scapegrace shifted himself out
 a woman's into a man's dress at goody green's
and gave goody green's dolly a goldpiece to say
nothing about it and no more she did to anyone
but me and she knows best herself whether
she gave change for the gold or not but master
louis is a saucy jackanapes and like enough
to ask it
three or four days elapsed while matters continued
in this condition the disguised prince
sometimes thinking on the intrigue which fortune
seemed to have thrown in his way for his
amusement and taking advantage such opportunities
as occurred to increase his intimacy with
alice lee but much oftener harassing doctor
rochecliffe with questions about the possibility
 escape which the good man finding himself unable
to answer secured his leisure against royal
 woodstock
importunity by retreating into the various unexplored
recesses the lodge known perhaps
only to himself who had been for nearly a score
 years employed in writing the wonders 
avoid stock
it chanced on the fourth day that some trifling
circumstance had called the knight abroad 
and he had left the young scotchman now familiar
in the family alone with alice in the parlour
 victor lee thus situated he thought the
time not unpropitious for entering upon a strain
 gallantry a kind which might be called experimental
such as is practised by the croats in
skirmishing when they keep bridle in hand ready
to attack the enemy or canter off without coming
to close quarters as circumstances may recommend
after using for nearly ten minutes a
sort metaphysical jargon which might according
to ahces pleasure have been interpreted
either into gallantry or the language serious
pretension and when he supposed her engaged
in fathoming his meaning he had the mortification
to find by a single and brief question that
he had been totally unattended to and that alice
woodstock 
was thinking on anything at the moment rather
than the sense what he had been saying she
asked him if he could tell what it was o'clock
and this with an air real curiosity concerning
the lapse time which put coquetry wholly out
 the question
i will go look at the sundial mistress
alice said the gallant rising and colouring
through a sense the contempt with which he
thought himself treated
you will do me a pleasure master kerneguy
said alice without the least consciousness
 the indignation she had excited
master louis kerneguy left the room accordingly
not however to procure the information
required but to vent his anger and mortification
and to swear with more serious purpose than he
had dared to do before that alice should rue
her insolence goodnatured as he was he was
still a prince unaccustomed to contradiction far
less to contempt and his self pride felt for the
moment wounded to the quick with a hasty
step he plunged into the chase only remembering
his own safety so far as to choose the deeper
 woodstock
and sequestered avenues where walking on with
the speedy and active step which his recovery
from fatigue now permitted him to exercise according
to his wont he solaced his angry purposes
by devising schemes revenge on the
insolent country coquette from which no consideration
 hospitality was in future to have
weight enough to save her
the irritated gallant passed
the dialstone aged and green
without deigning to ask it a single question nor
could it have satisfied his curiosity if he had for
no sun happened to shine at the moment he
then hastened forward muffling himself in his
cloak and assuming a stooping and slouching
gait which diminished his apparent height he
was soon involved in the deep and dim alleys 
the wood into which he had insensibly plunged
himself and was traversing it at a great rate
without having any distinct idea in what direction
he was going when suddenly his course was
arrested first by a loud hollo and then by a
summons to stand accompanied by what seemed
woodstock 
still more startling and extraordinary the touch
 a cane upon his shoulder imposed in a goodhumoured
but somewhat imperious manner
there were few symptoms recognition which
would have been welcome at this moment but
the appearance the person who had thus arrested
his course was least all that he could
have anticipated as timely or agreeable when he
turned on receiving the signal he beheld himself
close to a young man nearly six feet in height
well made in joint and limb but the gravity 
whose apparel although handsome and gentlemanlike
and a sort precision in his habit
from the cleanness and stiffness his band to
the unsullied purity his spanish leather shoes
bespoke a love order which was foreign to the
impoverished and vanquished cavaliers and proper
to the habits those the victorious party
who could afford to dress themselves handsomely 
and whose rule that is such as regarded the
higher and more respectable classes enjoined
decency and sobriety garb and deportment
there was yet another weight against the prince
in the scale and one still more characteristic 
 woodstock
the inequality in the comparison under which he
seemed to labour there was strength in the
muscular form the stranger who had brought
him to this involuntary parley authority and determination
in his brow a long rapier on the left
and a poniard or dagger on the right side his
belt and a pair pistols stuck into it which
would have been sufficient to give the unknown
the advantage louis kerneguy having no weapon
but his sword even had his personal strength
approached nearer than it did to that the person
by whom he was thus suddenly stopped
bitterly regretting the thoughtless fit passion
that brought him into his present situation
but especially the want the pistols he had left
behind and which do so much to place bodily
strength and weakness upon an equal footing
charles yet availed himself the courage and
presence mind in which few his unfortunate
family had for centuries been deficient he
stood firm and without motion his cloak still
wrapped round the lower part his face to
give time for explanation in case he was mistaken
for some other person
woodstock
this coolness produced its effect for the other
party said with doubt and surprise on his part
joceline johffe is it not if i know not jofeline
joliffe i should at least know my own
cloak
i am not joceline joliffe as you may see
sir said kerneguy calmly drawing himself
erect to show the difference size and dropping
the cloak from his face and person
indeed replied the stranger in surprise 
 then sir unknown i have to express my regret
at having used my cane in intimating that i
wished you to stop from that dress which i
certainly recognize for my own i concluded you
must be joceline in whose custody i had left my
habit at the lodge
if it had been joceline sir replied the
supposed kerneguy with perfect composure
methinks you should not have struck so hard
the other party was obviously confused by
the steady calmness with which he was encountered
the sense politeness dictated in the first
place an apology for a mistake when he thought
he had been tolerably certain the person masvol
 x
 woodstock
ter kerneguy was not in a situation to be punctilious
 he bowed gravely as indicating his acceptance
 the excuse offered then turned and
walked as he conceived towards the lodge
though he had traversed the woods which were
cut with various alleys in different directions too
hastily to be certain the real course which he
wished to pursue
he was much embarrassed to find that this
did not get him rid the companion whom he
had thus involuntarily acquired walked he
slow walked he fast his friend in the genteel
but puritanic habit strong in person and well
armed as we have described him seemed determined
to keep him company and without attempting
to join or enter into conversation never
suffered him to outstrip his surveillance for more
than two or three yards the wanderer mended
his pace but although he was then in his
youth as afterwards in his riper age one the
best walkers in britain the stranger without advancing
his pace to a run kept fully equal to
him and his persecution became so close and
constant and inevitable that the pride and fear
woodstock 
 charles were both alarmed and he began to
think that whatever the danger might be a
singlehanded rencontre he would nevertheless
have a better bargain this tall satellite if they
settled the debate betwixt them in the forest than
if they drew near any place habitation where
the man in authority was likely to find friends and
concurrence
betwixt anxiety therefore vexation and anger
charles faced suddenly round on his pursuer as
they reached a small narrow glade which led to
the little meadow over which presided the kmgs
oak the ragged and scathed branches and gigantic
trunk which formed a vista to the little
wild avenue
sir said he to his pursuer you have already
been guilty one piece impertinence
towards me you have apologised and knowing
no reason why you should distinguish me as an
object incivility i have accepted your excuse
without scruple is there anything remains to
be settled betwixt us which causes you to follow
me in this manner if so i shall be glad to make
it a subject explanation or satisfaction as the
 woodstock
case may admit i think you can owe me no
malice for i never saw you before to my knowledge
if you can give any good reason for asking
it i am willing to render you personal satisfaction
if your purpose is merely impertinent
curiosity i let you know that i will not suffer
myself to be dogged in my private walks by anyone

when i recognize my own cloak on another
man's shoulders replied the stranger drily
methinks i have a natural right to follow and
see what becomes it for know sir though i
have been mistaken as to the wearer yet i am
confident i had as good a right to stretch my cane
across the cloak you are muffled in as ever had
any one to brush his own garments if therefore
wg are to be friends i must ask for instance
how you came by that cloak and where you are
going with it i shall otherwise make bold to stop
you as one who has sufficient commission to do
so
oh unhappy cloak thought the wanderer
ay and thrice unhappy the idle fancy that sent
me here with it wrapped around my nose to pick
woodstock 
quarrels and attract observation when quiet and
secrecy were peculiarly essential to my safety 
if you will allow me to guess sir continued
the stranger who was no other than markham
everard i will convince you that you are better
known than you think for
now heaven forbid prayed the party addressed
in silence but with as much devotion as
ever he applied to a prayer in his life yet even
in this moment extreme urgency his courage
and composure did not fail and he recollected
it was the utmost importance not to seem startled
and to answer so as if possible to lead the
dangerous companion with whom he had met to
confess the extent his actual knowledge or suspicions
concerning him
if you know me sir he said and are a
gentleman as your appearance promises you
cannot be at a loss to what accident you must attribute
my wearing these clothes which you say
are yours
oh sir replied colonel everard his wrath
in no sort turned away by the mildness the
stranger's answer we have learned our ovid's
 woodstock
metamorphoses and we know for what purposes
young men quality travel in disguise we know
that even female attire is resorted to on certain
occasions we have heard vertumnus and
pomona
the monarch as he weighed these words
again uttered a devout prayer that this illlooking
affair might have no deeper root than the
jealousy some admirer alice lee promising
to himself that devotee as he was to the fair sex
he would make no scruple renouncing the
fairest eve's daughters in order to get out 
the present dilemma
sir he said you seem to be a gentleman
i have no objection to tell you as such that i also
am that class
or somewhat higher perhaps said everard

a gentleman is a term which comprehends
all ranks entitled to armorial bearings a duke
a lord a prince is no more than a gentleman 
and if in misfortune as i am he may be glad if
that general term courtesy is allowed him
sir replied everard i have no purpose
woodstock s
to entrap you to any acknowledgement fatal to
your own safety nor do i hold it my business
to be active in the arrest private individuals
whose perverted sense national duty may have
led them into errors rather to be pitied than
punished by candid men but if those who have
brought civil war and disturbance into their
native country proceed to carry dishonour and
disgrace into the bosom families if they attempt
to carry on their private debaucheries to
the injury the hospitable roofs which afford
them refuge from the consequences their public
crimes do you think ray lord that we shall
bear it with patience 
if it is your purpose to quarrel with me said
the prince speak it out at once like a gentleman
you have the advantage no doubt arras but
it is not that odds which will induce rae to fly
from a single man if on the other hand you
are disposed to hear reason i tell you in calm
words that i neither suspect the offence to which
you allude nor comprehend why you give me
the title ray lord
 woodstock
you deny then being the lord wilmot 
said everard
i may do so most safely said the prince
perhaps you rather style yourself earl 
rochester we heard that the issuing some
such patent by the king scots was a step which
your ambition proposed
neither lord nor earl am i as sure as i have
a christian soul to be saved my name is 
do not degrade yourself by unnecessary falsehood
my lord and that to a single man who 
promise you will not invoke public justice to assist
his own good sword should he see cause to
use it can you look at that ring and deny that
you are lord wilmot 
he handed to the disguised prince a ring which
he took from his purse and his opponent instantly
knew it for the same he had dropped into alice's
pitcher at the fountain obeying only though imprudently
the gallantry the moment in giving
a pretty gem to a handsome girl whom he had
accidentally frightened
i know the ring he said it has been in
my possession how it should prove me to be
woodstock 
lord wilmot i cannot conceive and beg to
say it bears false witness against me
you shall see the evidence answered everard
 and resuming the ring he pressed a spring
ingeniously contrived in the collet the setting
on which the stone flew back and showed within
it the cypher lord wilmot beautifully engraved
in miniature with a coronet what say
you now sir 
that probabilities are no proofs said the
prince there is nothing here save what can be
easily accounted for i am the son a scottish
nobleman who was mortally wounded and made
prisoner at worcester fight when he took leave
and bid me fly he gave me the few valuables he
possessed and that among others i have heard
him talk having changed rings with lord
wilmot on some occasion in scotland but 
never knew the trick the gem which you have
shown me
in this it may be necessary to say charles
spoke very truly nor would he have parted with
it in the way he did had he suspected it would be
easily recognised he proceeded after a minute's
vol y
 woodstock
pause once more sir i have told you
much that concerns my safety if you are generous
you will let me pass and i may do you on
some future day as good service if you mean
to arrest me ycu must do so here and at your
own peril for i will neither walk farther your
way nor permit you to dog me on mine if
you let me pass i will thank you if not take to
your weapon
young gentleman said colonel everard
whether you be actually the gay young nobleman
for whom i took you you have made
me uncertain but intimate as you say your
family has been with him i have little doubt
that you are proficient in the school debauchery
 which wilmot and villiers are professors
and their hopeful master a graduated student
your conduct at woodstock where you have
rewarded the hospitality the family by meditating
the most deadly wound to their honour
has proved you too apt a scholar in such an academy
i intended only to warn you on this subjects
will be your own fault if i add chastisement
to admonition
woodstock ss
warn me sir said the prince indignantly
and chastisement this is presuming more on
my patience than is consistent with yovu own
safety draw sir so saying he laid his hand
on his sword
my religion said everard forbids me to
be rash in shedding blood go home sir be
wise consult the dictates honour as well as
prudence respect the honour the house 
lee and know there is one nearly allied to it by
whom your motions will be called to severe accounts

aha said the prince with a bitter laugh
i see the whole matter now we have our
roundheaded colonel our puritan cousin before
us the man texts and morals whom alice
lee laughs at so heartily if your religion sir
prevents you from giving satisfaction it should
prevent you from offering insult to a person 
honour
the passions both were now fully up they
drew mutually and began to fight the colonel
relinquishing the advantage he could have obtained
by the use his firearms a thrust 
 woodstock
the arm or a slip the foot might at the
moment have changed the destinies britain
when the arrival a third party broke off the
combat

stay for the king has thrown his warder down
richard 
the combatants whom we left engaged at the
 the last volume made mutual passes at
each other with apparently equal skill and courage
charles had been too often in action and
too long a party as well as a victim to civil war
to find anything new or surprising in being obliged
to defend himself with his own hands and
everard had been distinguished as well for his
personal bravery as for the other properties 
c
 woodstock
a commander but the arrival a thud party
prevented the tragic conclusion a combat in
which the success either party must have given
him much cause for regretting his victory
it was the old knight himself who arrived
mounted upon a forest pony for the war and sequestration
had left him no steed a more dignified
description he thrust himself between the
combatants and commanded them on their lives to
hold so soon as a glance from one to the other
had ascertained to him whom he had to deal with
hedenanded whether the devils woodstock
whom folks talked about had got possession 
them both that they were tilting at each other
within the verge the royal liberties let me
tell both you he said that while old henry
fine is at woodstock the immunities the park
shall be maintained as much as if the king were
still on the throne none shall fight dwells here
excepting the stags in their seasons put up both
 you or i shall lug out as herdsman and prove
perhaps the worse devil the three as will
says
 ril so maul you and your toastingirons
that you sliull lliink illic devil has conic i'roui litll 
woodstock
the combatants desisted from their encounter
but stood looking at each other sullenly asmen
do in such a situation each unwilling to seem
to desire peace more than the other and averse
therefore to be the first to sheathe his sword
return your weapons gentlemen upon the
spot said the knight yet more peremptorily
one and both you or you will have something
to do with me i promise you you maybe
thankful times are changed i have known
them such that your insolence might have cost
each you your hand if not redeemed with a
round sum money nephew if you do not
mean to alienate me for ever i command you to
put up master kerneguy you are my guest
i request you not to do me the insult remaining
with your sword drawn where it is my
duty to see peace observed
 i obey you sir henry said the king
sheathing his rapier i hardly indeed know
wherefore i was assaulted by this gentleman
i assure you none respects the king's person or
privileges more than thyself though the devotion
is somewhat out fashion 
 woodstock
we may find a place to meet sir replied
everard where neither the royal person nor
privileges can be offended
faith very hardly sir said charles unable
to suppress the rising jest i mean the
king has so few followers that the loss the
least them might be some small damage to him
but risking all that i will meet you wherever
there is fair field for a poor cavalier to get off in
safety if he has the luck in fight
sir henry lee's first idea had been fixed upon
the insult offered to the royal demesne he now
began to turn them towards the safety his
kinsman and the young royalist as he deemed
him gentlemen he said i must insist on
this business being put to a final nephew
markham is this your return for my condescension
in coming back to woodstock on your warrant
that you should take an opportunity to cut
the throat my guest 
if you knew his purpose as well as i do 
said markham and then paused conscious that
he might only incense his uncle without convincing
him as anything he might say kerneguy's
woodstock 
addresses to alice was like to be imputed to his
own jealous suspicions he looked on the ground
therefore and was silent
and you master kerneguysaid sir henry
can you give me any reason why you seek to
take the use this young man in whom though
unhappily forgetful his loyalty and duty i
must yet take some interest as my nephew by
affinity 
 i was not aware the gentleman enjoyed that
honour which certainly would have protected
him from my sword answered kerneguy but
the quarrel is his nor can i tell any reason why
he fixed it upon me unless it were the difference
 our political opinions
you know the contrary said everard
you know that i told you you were safe from
me as a fugitive royalist and your last words
showed you were at no loss to guess my connexion
with sir henry that indeed is little
consequence i should debase myself did i use
the relationship as a means protection from
you or any one
as they thus disputed neither choosing to 
woodstock
proach the real cause quarrel sir henry looked
from the one to the other with a peacemaking
countenance exclaiming 
 why what an intricate impeach is this 
i think you both have drunk circe's cup
come my young masters allow an old man to
mediate between you i am not shortsighted in
such matters the mother mischief is no bigger
than a gnat's wing and i have known fifty
instances in my own day when as will says
gallants have been confronted hardily
in single opposition hand to hand
in which after the field was fought no one could
remember the cause quarrel tush a small
thing will do it the taking the wall or the
gentle rub the shoulder in passing each other
or a hasty word or a misconceived gesturecome
forget your cause quarrel be what it will
you have had your breathing and though you
put up your rapiers unbodied that was no default
 yours but by command your elder
and one who had right to use authority in malta
where the duello is punctiliously well understood
the persons engaged in a single combat
wooustock 
are bound to halt on the command a knight
or priest or lady and the quarrel so interrupted
is held as honourably terminated and may not
be revived nephew it is i think impossible
that you can nourish spleen against this young
gentleman for having fought for his king hear
my honest proposal markham you know i
bear no malice though i have some reason to be
offended with you give the young man your
hand in friendship and we will back to the
lodge all three together and drink a cup 
sack in token reconciliations
markham everard found himself unable to
resist this approach towards kindness on his uncle's
part he suspected indeed what was partly
the truth that it was not entirely from reviving
good will but also that his uncle thought
by such attention to secure his neutrality at least
if not his assistance for the safety the fugitive
royalist he was sensible that he was placed in
an awkward predicament and that he might incur
the suspicions his own party for holding
intercourse even with a near relation who harboured
such guests but on the other hand he
thought his services to the commonwealth had
 woodstock 
been sufficient importance to outweigh whatever
envy might urge on that topic indeed although
the civil war had divided families much
and in many various ways yet when it seemed
ended by the triumph the republicans the
rage political hatred began to relent and the
ancient ties kindred and friendship regained at
least a part their former influence many reunions
were formed and those who like everard
adhered to the conquering party often exerted
themselves for the protection then deserted
relatives
as these things rushed through his mind accompanied
with the prospect a renewed intercourse
with alice lee by means which he
might be at hand to protect her against every
chance either injury or insult he held out his
hand to the supposed scottish page saying at
the same time that for his part he was very
ready to forget the cause quarrel or rather to
consider it as arising out a misapprehension
and to offer master kerneguy such friendship as
might exist between honourable men who had
embraced different sides in politics
unable to overcome the feeling personal
woodstock 
dignity which prudence recommended to him
to forget louis kerneguy in return bowed low
but without accepting everard's proffered hand
 he had no occasion he said to make any
exertions to forget the cause quarrel for he
had never been able to comprehend it but ashe
had not shunned the gentleman's resentment
so he was now willing to embrace and return any
degree his favour with which he might be
pleased to honour him
everard withdrew his hand with a smile and
bowed in return to the salutation the page
whose stiff reception his advances he imputed
to the proud pettish disposition a scotch boy
trained up in ideas family consequence and
personal importance which his acquaintance with
the world had not yet been sufficient to dispel
sir henry lee delighted with the termination
 the quarrel which he supposed to be in
deep deference to his own authority and not displeased
with the opportunity renewing some
acquaintance with his nephew who had notwithstanding
his political demerits a warmer interest
in his affections than he was perhaps himself
aware said in a tone consolation never
woodstock
be mortified young gentlemen i protest it went
to my heart to part you when i saw you stretching
yourselves so handsomely and in fair love 
honour without any malicious or bloodthirsty
thoughts i promise you had it not been for
my duty as ranger here and sworn to the office
i would rather have been your umpire than
your hindrance but a finished quarrel is a
forgotten quarrel and your tilting should have
no further consequence excepting the appetite it
may have given you
so saying he mounted his pony and moved
forward in triumph towards the lodge by the
nearest alley his feet almost touching the ground
the ball his toe just resting in the stirrup 
the fore part the thigh brought round to the
saddle the heels turned outwards and sunk as
much as possible his body precisely erect the
reins properly and systematically divided in his
left hand his right holding a ridingrod diagonally
pointed towards the horse's left ear he
seemed a champion the menage fit to have
reined bucephalus himself his youthful companions
who attended on either hand like equerry
wooustock 
nes could scarce suppress a smile at the completely
adjusted and systematic posture the
rider contrasted with the wild and diminutive
appearance the pony with its shaggy coat and
long tail and mane and its keen eyes sparkling
like red coals from amongst the mass hair
which fell over its small countenance if the
reader has the duke newcastle's on horsemanship
splendid moles he may have some
idea the figure the good knight if he can
conceive such a figure as one the cavaliers there
represented seated in all the graces his art
on a welch or exmoor pony in its native savage
state without grooming or discipline any
kind the ridicule being greatly enhanced by the
disproportion size betwixt the animal and its
rider
perhaps the knight saw their wonder for the
first words he said after they left the ground
were pixie though small is mettlesome gentlemen
here he contrived that pixie should
himself corroborate the assertion by executing a
gambade he is diminutive but full spirit 
indeed save that i am somewhat too large for
hi
 woodstock
an elfin horseman the knight was upwards 
six feet high i should remind myself when i
mount him the fairy king as described by
mike drayton 
himself he on an earwig set
yet scarce upon his back could get
so oft and high he did curvet
ere he himself did settle
he made him stop and turn and bound
to gallop and to trot the round
he scarce could stand on any ground
he was so full mettle
my old friend pixie said everard stroking
the pony's neck i am glad that hellas
survived all these bustling days pixie must be
above twenty years old sir henry 
above twenty years certainly yes nephew
markham war is a whirlwind in a plantation
mhich only spares what is least worth leaving
old pixie and his old master have survived many
a tall fellow and many a great horse neither 
them good for much themselves yet as will
says an old man can do somewhat so pixie
and i still survive
so saying he again contrived that pixie should
show some remnants activity
woodstock 
 still survive said the young scot completing
the sentence which the good knight had left
unfinished ay still survive
to witch the world with noble horsemanship 
everard coloured for he felt the irony but
not so his uncle whose simple vanity never permitted
him to doubt the sincerity the compliment

are you advised that he said in king
james's time indeed i have appeared in the
tiltyard and there you might have said 
you saw young harry with his beaver up
as to seeing old harry why here the
knight paused and looked as a bashful man in
labour a pun as to old harry why you
might as well see the devil you take me master
kerneguy the devil you know is my namesake
ha ha ha cousin everard i hope your
precision is not startled by an innocent jest 
he was so delighted with the applause both
his companions that he recited the whole the
celebrated passage referred to and concluded
 woodstock
with defying the present age bundle all its wits
donne cowley waller and the rest them together
to produce a poet a tenth part the
genius old will
why we are said to have one his descendants
among us sir william d'avenant
said louis kerneguy and many think him as
clever a fellow
what exclaimed sir henry will
davenant whom i knew in the north an officer
under newcastle when the marquis lay before
hull why he was an honest cavalier and ivrote
good doggrel enough but how came he akin to
will shakspeare i trow 
why replied the young scot by the
surer side the house and after the old fashion
if davenant speaks truth it seems that his
mother was a goodlooking laughing buxom
mistress an inn between stratford and london
at which will shakspeare often quartered
as he went down to his native town and that out
 friendship and gossipred as we say in scotland
will shakspeare became godfather to will
d'avcnant and not contented with this spiritual
woodstock 
activity the younger will is for establishing some
claim to a natural one alleging that his mother
was a great admirer wit and there were no
bounds to her complaisance for men genius
out upon the hound said colonel everard
 would he purchase the reputation descending
from poet or from prince at the expense
 his mother's good fame this nose ought to
be slit
that would be difficult answered the disguised
prince recollecting the peculiarity the
bard's countenance
will d'avenant the son will shakspeare
 said the knight who had not yet recovered
his surprise at the enormity the pretension
 why it reminds me a verse in the 
 phaeton where the hero complains
to his mother 
besides by all the village boys i am shamed
you the sun's son you rascal you be d ed 
we observe this couplet in fielding's farce tumbledown
dick founded on the same classical story as it was current in
the time the commonwealth it must have reached the author
 tom jones by tradition for no one will suspect the present
author making the anachronism
vol iii b
 woodstock
i never heard such unblushing assurance in my
life swill d'avenant the son the brightest
and best poet that ever was is or will be but
i crave your pardon nephew you i believe
love no stageplays
nay i am not altogether so precise as you
would make me uncle i have loved them perhaps
too well in my time and now i condemn
them not altogether or in gross though i approve
not their excesses and extravagances i
cannot even in shakspeare but see many things
both scandalous to decency and prejudicial to
good manners many things which tend to ridicule
virtue or to recommend vice at least to
mitigate the hideousness its features i cannot
think these fine poems are an useful study
and especially for the youth either sex in
which bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupation
 the men and intrigue as the sole employment
 the women
in making these observations everard was
simple enough to think that he was only giving
his uncle an opportunity defending a favourite
opinion without offending him by a contrawoodstock

diction which was so limited and mitigated but
here as on other occasions he forgot how obstinate
his uncle was in his views whether religion
policy or taste and that it would be as easy to
convert him to the presbyterian form government
or engage him to take the abjuration oath
as to shake his belief in shakspeare there was
another peculiarity in the good knight's mode 
arguing which everard being himself a plain
and downright character and one whose religious
tenets were in some degree unfavourable to the
suppressions and simulations often used in society
could never perfectly understand sir henry
sensible his natural heat temper was
wont scrupulously to guard against it and would
for some time when in fact much offended conduct
a debate with all the external appearance 
composure till the violence his feelings would
rise so high as to overcome and bear away the
artificial barriers opposed to it and rush down
upon the adversary with accumulating wrath it
thus frequently happened that like a wily old
general he retreated in the face his disputant
in good order and by degrees with so moderate
w woodstock
a degree resistance as to draw on his antagonist's
pursuit to the spot where at length making
a sudden and unexpected attack with horse
foot and artillery at once he seldom failed to
confound the enemy though he might not overthrow
him
it was on this principle therefore that hearing
everard's last observation he disguised his angry
feelings and answered with a tone where politeness
was called in to keep guard upon passion
that undoubtedly the presbyterian gentry had
given through the whole these unhappy times
such proofs an humble unaspiring and unambitious
desire the public good as entitled them
to general credit for the sincerity those very
strong scruples which they entertained against
works in which the noblest sentiments religion
and virtue sentiments which might convert
hardened sinners and be placed with propriety
in the mouths dying saints and martyrs
happened from the rudeness and coarse taste
 the times to be mixed with some broad jests
and similar matter which lay not mich in the
way excepting those who painfully sought it
woodstock sjl
out that they might use it in vilifying what was
in itself deserving the highest applause but
what he wished especially to know from his nephew
was whether any those gifted men
who had expelled the learned scholars and deep
divines the church england from the pulpit
and now flourished in their stead received
any inspiration from the muses if he might use
so profane a term without offence to colonel everard
or whether they were not as sottishly and
brutally averse from elegant letters as they were
from humanity and common sense 
colonel everard might have guessed by the
ironical tone in which this speech was delivered
what storm was mustering within his uncle's bosom
 nay he might have conjectured the state
 the old knight's feelings from his emphasis on
the word colonel by which epithet as that which
most connected his nephew with the party he
hated he never distinguished everard unless
when his wrath was rising while on the contrary
when disposed to be on good terms with
him he usually called him kinsman or nephew
markham indeed it was under a partial sense
n
woodstock
that this was the case and in the hope to see his
cousin alice that the colonel forbore making any
answer to the harangue his uncle which had
concluded just as the old knight had alighted at
the door the lodge and was entering the
hall followed by his two attendants
phoebe at the same time made her appearance
in the hall and received orders to bring some
beverage for the gentlemen the hebe 
woodstock failed not to recognize and welcome
everard by an almost imperceptible courtesy 
but she did not serve her interest as she designed
when she asked the knight as a question 
course whether he commanded the attendance 
mistress alice a stern no was the decided reply
and the illtimed interference seemed to increase
his previous irritation against everard for
his depreciation shakspeare i would insist
said sir henry resuming the obnoxious sub 
sect were it fit for a poor disbanded cavalier to
use such a phrase towards a commander the
conquering army upon knowing whether the
convulsion which has sent us saints and prophets
without has not also afforded us a poet with
woodstock s
enough both gifts and grace to outshine poor
old will the oracle and idol us blinded and
carnal cavaliers
surely sir replied colonel everard i
know verses written by a friend the commonwealth
and those too a dramatic character
which weighed in an impartial scale might equal
even the poetry shakspeare and which are free
from the fustian and indelicacy with which that
great bard was sometimes content to feed the
coarse appetites his barbarous audience
indeed said the knight keeping down his
wrath with difficulty i should like to be acquainted
with this masterpiece poetry may
we ask the name this distinguished person 
it must be vicars or withers at least
said the feigned page
no sir replied everard nor drummond
 hawthorne nor lord stirling neither 
and yet the verses will vindicate what i say if
you will make allowance for indifferent recitation
for i am better accustomed to speak to a
battalion than to those who love the muses the
speaker is a lady benighted who having lost her
 woodstock
way in a pathless forest at first expresses herself
agitated by the supernatural fears to which
her situation gave rise
a play too and written by a roundhead
author said sir henry in surprise
a dramatic production at least replied his
nephew and began to recite simply but with
feeling the lines now so well known but which
had then obtained no celebrity the fame the
author resting upon the basis rather his polemical
and political publications than on the poetry
doomed in after days to support the eternal
structure his immortality
these thoughts may startle but will not astound
the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
by a strongsiding champion conscience
my own opinion nephew markham my
own opinion better expressed but j must what i
said when the scoundrelly roundheads pretended
to see ghosts at woodstock go on i prithee

everard proceeded 
o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope
thou hovering angel girt with golden wings
and thou unblemish'd form chastity 
woodstock 
 see ye visibly and now believe
that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
are but as slavish officers vengeance
would send a glittering guardian if need were
to keep my life and honour assailed
was i deceived or did a sable cloud
turn forth her silver lining on the night 
the rest has escaped me said the reciter 
and i marvel i have been able to remember so
much
sir henry lee who had expected some effusion
very different from those classical and beautiful
lines soon changed the scornful expression
 his countenance relaxed his contorted upper
lip and stroking down his beard with his left
hand rested the forefinger the right upon his
eyebrow in sign profound attention after
everard had ceased speaking the old man sighed
as at the a strain sweet music he then
spoke in a gentler manner than formerly
cousin markham he said these verses
flow sweetly and sound in my ears like the welltouched
warbling a lute but thou knowest
i am something slow apprehending the full
meaning that which i hear for the first time
repeat mc these verses again slowly and delibc
 woodstock
lately for i always love to hear poetry twice
the first time for sound and the latter time for
sense
thus encouraged everard recited again the
lines with more hardihood and better effect the
knight distinctly understanding and from his
looks and motions highly applauding them
yes he broke out when everard was
again silent yes i do call that poetry 
though it were even written by a presbyterian
or an anabaptist either ay there were good and
righteous people to be found even amongst the offending
towns which were destroyed by fire and
certainly i have heard though but with little
credence begging your pardon cousin everard
that there are men among you who have seen the
error their ways in rebelling against the best
and kindest masters and bringing it to that
pass that he was murdered by a gang yet fiercer
than themselves ay doubtless the gentleness
 spirit and the purity mind which dictated
those beautiful lines has long ago taught a man
so amiable to say i have sinned i have sinned
yes i doubt not so sweet a harp has been broken
woodstock 
even in remorse for the crimes he was witness
to and now he sits drooping for the shame and
sorrow england all his noble rhymes as
will says
like sweet bells jangled out tune and harsh
dost thou not think so master kerneguy 
not i sir henry answered the page
what dost not believe the author these
lines must needs be the better file and leaning
to our persuasion 
i think sir henry that the poetry qualifies
the author to write a play on the subject dame
potiphar and her recusant lover and as for his
calling that last metaphor the cloud in a black
coat or cloak with silver lining would have dubbed
him a tailor with me only that i happen to
know that he is a schoolmaster by profession
and by political opinions qualified to be poet
laureate to cromwell for what colonel everard
has repeated with such unction is the production
 no less celebrated a person than john
milton
 woodstock
 john milton exclaimed sir henry in astonishment
 what john milton the blasphemous
and bloodyminded author the defense
populi anglican the advocate the infernal
high court fiends the creature and parasite
 that grand impostor that loathsome hypocrite
that detestable monster that prodigy the universe
that disgrace mankind that landscape 
iniquity that sink sin and that compendium
 baseness oliver cromwell 
even the same john milton answered
charles schoolmaster to little boys and tailor
to the clouds which he furnishes with suits 
black lined with silver at no other expense than
that common sense
markham everard said the old knight
i will never forgive thee never never thou
hast made me speak words praise respecting
one whose offal should fatten the regionkites 
speak not to me sir but begone am i your
kinsman and benefactor a fit person to be juggled
out ray commendation and praise and
brought to bedaub such a whitened sepulchre as
the sophist mihon 
woodstock 
i profess said everard this is hard measure
sir henry you pressed rne you defied
me to produce poetry as good as shakspeare's
i only thought the verses not the politics
 milton
oh yes sir replied sir henry we well
know your power making distinctions you
could make war against the king's prerogative
without having the least design against his person
oh heaven forbid but heaven will hear
and judge you set down the beverage phoebe
this was added by way parenthesis to
phoebe who entered with refreshment colonel
everard is not thirsty you have wiped your
mouths and said you have done no evil but
though you have deceived man yet god you
cannot deceive
charged thus at once with the faults imputed
to his whole religious sect and political party
everard felt too late what imprudence he had
been guilty in giving the opening by disputing
his uncle's taste in dramatic poetry he endeavoured
to explainto apologize
 woodstock
i mistook your purpose honoured sir and
thought you really desired to know something 
our literature and in repeating what you thought
not unworthy your hearing i profess i thought
i was doing you pleasure instead stirring your
indignation
o ay returned the knight with unmitigated
rigour resentment profess profess 
ay that is the new phrase asseveration instead
 the profane adjuration courtiers and
cavaliers oh sir profess less and practise more
and so good day to you master kerneguy
you will find beverage in my apartment
while phoebe stood gaping in admiration at
the sudden quarrel which had arisen colonel
everard's vexation and resentment was not a
little increased by the nonchance the young
scotchman who with his hands thrust into his
pockets with a courtly affectation the time
had thrown himself into one the antique chairs
and though habitually too polite to laugh aloud
and possessing that art internal laughter by
which men the world learn to indulge their
mirth without incurring quarrels or giving direct
woodstock
offence was at no particular trouble to conceal
that he was exceedingly amused by the result 
the colonels visit to woodstock colonel everard's
patience however had reached bounds
which it was very likely to surpass for though
differing widely in politics there was a resemblance
betwixt the temper the uncle and nephew

damnation exclaimed the colonel in a
tone which became a puritan as little as did the
exclamation itself
amen said louis kerneguy but in a tone
so soft and gentle that the ejaculation seemed
rather to escape him than to be designedly uttered

sir said everard striding towards him in
that sort humour when a man full resentment
would not unwillingly find an object on
which to discharge it
plait il f said the page in the most equable
tone looking up in his face with the most unconscious
innocence
i wish to know sir the meaning that
which you said just now 
s woodstock
only a pouring out the spirit worthy
sir returned kerneguy a small skiff dispatched
to heaven on my own account to keep company
with your holy petition just now expressed
sir i have known a man's bones broke for
such a smile as you wear just now replied everard

there look you now answered the malicious
page who could not weigh even the
thoughts his safety against the enjoyment 
his jest if you had stuck to your professions
worthy sir you must have choked by this time 
but your round execration bolted like a cork from
a bottle cider and now allows your wrath to
come foaming out after it in the honest unbaptized
language common ruffians
for heaven's sake master gurney said
rhcebe forbear giving the colonel these bitter
words and doyougood colonel markham scorn
to take offence at his hands he is but a boy
if the colonel or you choose mistress phoebe
you shall find me a man i think the gentleman
can say something to the purpose already 
probably he may recommend to you the part 
woodstock 
the lady in comus and i only hope his own
admiration john milton will not induce him
to undertake the part sampson agonies and
blow up this old house with execrations or pull
it down in wrath about our ears
young man said the colonel still in towering
passion if you respect my principles for
nothing else be grateful to the protection which
but for them you would not easily attain
nay then said the attendant i must fetch
those who have more influence with you than i
have and away tripped phoebe while kerneguy
answered to everard in the same provoking
tone calm indifference
before you menace me with a thing so formidable
as your resentment you ought to be certain
whether i may not be compelled by circumstances
to deny you the opportunity you seem to
point at
at this moment a lice summoned no doubt by
her attendant entered the hall hastily
master kerneguy she said my father
requests to see you in victor lee's apartment
vol hi c
 woodstock
kerneguy arose and bowed but seemed determined
to remain till everard's departure so
as to prevent any explanation betwixt the cousins

markham said alice hurriedly cousin
everard i have but a moment to remain here
for god's sake do you instantly begone be
cautious and patient but do not tarry here my
father is fearfully incensed
i have had my uncle's word for that madam
replied everard as well as his injunction
to depart which i will obey without delay i
was not aware that you would have seconded
so harsh an order quite so willingly but i go
madam sensible i leave those behind whose company
is more agreeable
unjust ungenerous ungrateful said
alice but fearful her words might reach ears
for which they were not designed she spoke
them in a voice so feeble that her cousin for
whom they were intended lost the consolation
they were calculated to convey
he bowed coldly to alice as taking leave and
said with an air that constrained courtesy
woodstock 
which sometimes covers among men condition
the most deadly hatred i believe master kern
that i must make it convenient at present
to suppress my own peculiar opinions on the matter
which we have hinted at in our conversation
in which case i will send a gentleman who i hope
may be able to conquer yours
the supposed scotsman made him a stately
and at the same time a condescending bow said
he should expect the honour his commands
offered hi hand to mistress alice to conduct her
back to her father's apartment and took a triumphant
leave his rival
everard on the other hand stung beyond his
patience and from the grace and composed assurance
 the youth's carriage still conceiving
him to be either wilmot or some his compeers
in rank and profligacy returned to the
town woodstock determined not to be outbearded
even though he should seek redress by
means which his principles forbade him to consider
as justifiable

in nature is a tyranny it hath been
the untimely emptying many a throne

while colonel everard retreated in high
indignation from the little refection which sir
henry lee had in his goodhumour offered and
withdrawn under the circumstances provocation
which we have detailed the good old knight
scarce recovered from his fit passion partook
 it with his daughter and guest and shortly
after recollecting some sylvan task for though
to little efficient purpose he still regularly attended
to his duties as ranger he called bevis and
went out leaving the two young people together
 now said the amorous prince to himself
that alice is left without her lion it remains to
woodstock
si
see whether she is herself a tigress breed so
sir bevis has left his charge he said aloud i
thought the knights old those stern guardians
 which he is so fit a representative were more
rigorous in maintaining a vigilant guard
 bevis said alice knows that his attendance
on me is totally needless and moreover
he has other duties to perform which every true
knight prefers to dangling the whole morning by
a lady's sleeve
you speak treason against all true affection
said the gallant a lady's lightest wish should
to a true knight be more binding than aught excepting
the summons his sovereign i wish
mistress alice you would but intimate your
slightest desire to me and you should see how
i have practised obedience
you never brought me word what o'clock it
was this morning replied the young lady and
there i sat questioning the wings time when
i should have remembered that gentlemen's gallantry
can be quite as fugitive as time himself
how do you know what your disobedience may
have cost me and others pudding and dumpling
 o
 
 woodstock
may have been burned to a cinder for sir i
practise the old domestic rule visiting the
kitchen or i may have missed prayers or i may
have been too late for an appointment simply by
the negligence master louis kerneguy failing
to let me know the hour the day
o replied kerneguy i am one those
lovers who cannot endure absence i must be
eternally at the feet my fair enemy such i
think is the title with which romances teach us
to grace the fair and cruel to whom we devote our
hearts and lives speak for me good lute he
added taking up the instrument and show whether
i know not my duty
he sung but with more taste than execution
the air a french rondeau to which some the
wits or sonnetteers in his gay and roving train
had adapted english verses
an hour with thee when earliest day
dapples with gold the eastern grey
oh what can frame my mind to bear
the toil and turmoil care and care
new griefs which coming hours unfold
and sftd remembrance the old 
one hour with thes
woodstock j
one hour with thee when burning june
waves his red flag at pitch noon 
what shall repay the faithful swain
his labour on the sultry plain 
and more than cave or sheltering bough
cool feverish blood and throbbing brow 
one hour with thee
one hour with thee i when sun is set
o what can teach me to forget
the thankless labours the day 
the hopes the wishes siang away 
the increasing wants and lessening gains
the master's pride who scorns my pains 
one hour with thee
 truly there is another verse said the songster
 but i sing it not to you mistress alice because
some the prudes the court liked it not
i thank you master louis answered the
young lady both for your discretion in singing
what has given me pleasure and in forbearing
what might offend me though a country girl i
pretend to be so far the court mode as to receive
nothing which does not pass current among
the better class there
i would answered louis that you were
so well confirmed in their creed as to let all pass
with you to which court ladies would give currency

 woodstock
and what would be the consequence said
auce with perfect composure
in that case said louis embarrassed like a
general who finds that his preparations for attack
do not seem to strike either fear or confusion into
the enemy in that case you would forgive me
fair alice if i spoke to you in a warmer language
than that mere gallantry if i told you how
much my heart was interested in what you consider
as idle jesting if i seriously owned it was in your
power to make me the happiest or the most miserable
 human beings
master kerneguy said alice with the same
unshaken nonchance let us understand each
other i am little acquainted with highbred manners
and i am unwilling i tell you plainly to be
accounted a silly country girl who either from
ignorance or conceit is startled at every word 
gallantry addressed to her by a young man who
for the present has nothing better to do than coin
and circulate such false compliments but i must
sot let this fear seeming rustic and awkwardly
timorous carry me too far and being ignorant 
the exact limits i will take care to stop within
them
woodstock 
i trust madam said kerneguy that however
severely you may be disposed to judge 
me your justice will not punish me too severely
for an offence which your charms are alone the
occasion 
hear me out sir if you please resumed
alice i have listened to you when you spoke
en herder nay my complaisance has been so
great as to answer you en herbert for i do not
think anything except ridicule can come dialogues
betwixt lindor and jeannaton and the
principal fault the style is its extreme and tiresome
silliness and affectation but when you begin
to kneel offer to take my hand and speak with
a more serious tone i must remind you our
real characters i am the daughter sir henry
lee sir and you are or profess to be master
louis kerneguy my brother's page and a fugitive
for shelter under my father's roof who incurs
danger by the harbour he affords you and whose
household therefore ought not to be disturbed by
your un pleasing importunities
i would to heaven fair alice said the king
 that your objections to the suit which i am
 woodstock
urging not in jest but most seriously as that on
which my happiness depends rested only on the low
and precarious station louis keraeguy alice
thou hast the soul thy family and must needs
love honour i am no more the needy scottish
page whom i have for my own purposes personated
than i am the awkward lout whose manners
i adopted on the first night our acquaintance
this hand poor as i seem can confer a coronet

keep it said alice for some more ambitious
damsel my lord for such i conclude is
your title if this romance be true i would not
accept your hand could you confer a duchy
in one sense lovely alice you have neither
overrated my power nor my affection it is your
king it is charles stuart who speaks to you 
he can confer duchies and if beauty can merit
them it is that auce lee nay nay arise 
do not kneel it is for your sovereign to kneel to
thee alice to whom he is a thousand times more
devoted than the wanderer louis dared venture
to profess himself my alice has i know been
trained up in those principles love and obey

dienceto her sovereign that she cannot in conscience
or in mercy inflict on him such a wound
as would be implied in the rejection his suit
in spite all charles's attempts to prevent
her alice had persevered in kneeling on one knee
until she had touched with her lip the hand with
which he attempted to raise her but this salutation
ended she stood upright with her arms
folded on her bosom her looks humble but composed
keen and watchful and so possessed herself
 little flattered by the communication which
the king had supposed would have been overpowering
that he scarce knew in what terms
next to urge his solicitation
thou art silent thou art silent he said
my pretty alice has the king no more influence
with thee than the poor scottish page 
in one sense every influence said alice 
for he commands my best thoughts my best
wishes my earnest prayers my devoted loyalty
which as the men the house lee have been
ever ready to testify with the sword so are the
women bound to seal if necessary with their
blood but beyond the duties a true and devoir
woodstock
ted subject the king is even less to alice lee
than poor louis kerneguy the page could have
tendered an honourable union the monarch can
but offer a contaminated coronet
you mistake alice you mistake said the
king eagerly sit down and let me speak to
you sit down what isn't you fear 
i fear nothing my lord answered alice
what can i fear from the king britain i
the daughter his loyal subject and under my
father's roof but i remember the distance betwixt
us and though i might trifle and jest with
mine equal to ray king i must only appear in the
dutiful posture a subject unless where his safety
may seem to require that i do not acknowledge
his dignity
charles though young being no novice in such
scenes was surprised to encounter resistance 
a kind which had not been opposed to him in
similar pursuits even in cases where he had been
unsuccessful there was neither anger nor injured
pride nor disorder nor disdain real or affected
in the manners and conduct alice she
tond as it seemed calmly prepared to argue on
woodstock 
the subject which is generally decided by passion
showed no inclination to escape from the apartment
but appeared determined to hear with patience
the suit the lover while her countenance
and manner intimated that she had this complaisance
only in deference to the commands the
king
she is ambitious thought charles it is
by dazzling her love glory not by mere passionate
entreaties that i must hope to be successful
i pray you be seated my fair alice he said
the lover entreats the king commands you
the king said alice may permit the
relaxation the ceremonies due to royalty but
he cannot abrogate the subject's duty even by
express command i stand here while it is your
majesty's pleasure to address me a patient listener
as in duty bound
know then simple girl said the king
that in accepting my proffered affection and
protection you break through no law either 
virtue or morality those who are born to royalty
are deprived many the comforts private
life chiefly that which is perhaps the dearest
 woodstock
and most precious the power choosing their
own mates for life their formal weddings are
guided upon principles political expedience
only and those to whom they are wedded are
frequently in temper person and disposition
the most unlikely to make them happy society
has commiseration therefore towards us and
binds our unwilling and often unhappy wedlock
with chains a lighter and more easy character
than those which fetter other men whose marriage
ties as more voluntarily assumed ought in proportion
to be more strictly binding and therefore
ever since the time that old henry built
these walls priests and prelates as well as nobles
and statesmen have been accustomed to see a fair
rosamond rule the heart an affectionate monarch
and console him for the few hours constraint
and state which he must bestow upon some
angry and jealous eleanor to such a connexion
the world attaches no blame they rush to the
festival to admire the beauty the lovely esther
while the imperious vashti is left to queen it in
solitude they throng the palace to ask her protection
whose influence is more in the state an
woodstock 
hundred times than that the proud consort 
her offspring rank with the nobles the land
and vindicate by their courage like the celebrated
longford earl salisbury their descent from
royalty and from love from such connexions
our richest ranks nobles are recruited and
the mother lives in the greatness her posterity
honoured and blessed as she died lamented and
wept in the arms love and friendship
did rosamond so die my lord said alice
our records say she was poisoned by the injured
queen poisoned without time allowed to call to
god for the pardon her many faults did her
memory so live i have heard that when the
bishop purified the church at godstowe her monument
was broken open by his orders and her
bones thrown out into unconsecrated ground
those were rude old days sweet alice answered
charles queens are not now so jealous
nor bishops so rigorous and know besides that
in the lauds to which i would lead the loveliest
 her sex other laws obtain which remove from
such ties even the slightest show scandal
there is a mode matrimony which fulfilling
 woodstock
all the rites the church leaves no stain on the
conscience yet investing the bride with none 
the privileges peculiar to her husband's condition
infringes not upon the duties which the king
owes to his subjects so that alice lee may
in all respects become the real and lawful wife 
charles stuart except that their private union
gives her no title to be queen england
my ambition said alice will be sufficiently
gratified to see charles king without aiming
to share either his dignity in public or his
wealth and regal luxury in private
i understand thee alice said the king
hurt but not displeased you ridicule me being
a fugitive for speaking like a king it is a
habit i admit which i have learned and 
which even misfortune cannot cure me but my
case is not so desperate as you may suppose my
friends are still many in these kingdoms my allies
abroad are bound by regard to their own interest
to espouse my cause i have hopes given me
from spain from france and from other nations 
arid i have confidence that my father's blood has
not been poured forth in vain nor is doomed to
woo us took 
dry up without due vengeance my trust is in
him from whom princes derive their title and
think what thou wilt my present condition i
have perfect confidence that i shall one day sit on
the throne england
may god grant it said alice and that
he may grant it noble prince deign to consider
whether you now pursue a conduct likely to conciliate
his favour think the course you recommend
to a motherless maiden who has no
better defence against your sophistry than what
the natural feeling female dignity inspires
whether the death her father which would bethe
consequence her imprudence whether the
despair her brother whose life has been so often
in peril to save that your majesty whether
the dishonour the roof which has sheltered
you will read well in your annals or are events
likely to propitiate god whose controversy with
your house has been but too visible or recover
the affections the people england in whose
eyes such actions are an abomination i leave to
your own royal mind to consider
ol iii d
 woodstock
diaries paused struck with a turn to the conversation
which placed his own interests more in
collision with the gratification his present passion
than he had supposed
if your majesty said alice curtseying
deeply has no farther commands for my attendance
may i be permitted to withdraw 
stay yet a little strange and impracticable
girl said the king and answer me but one
question is it the lowness my present fortunes
that makes my suit contemptible 
i have nothing to conceal my liege she
said and my answer shall be as plain and direct
as the question you have asked if i could
have been moved to an act ignominious insane
and ungrateful folly it could only arise from my
being blinded by that passion which i believe is
pleaded as an excuse for folly and for crime much
more often than it has a real existence i must
in short have been in love as it is called and
that might have been with my equal but surely
never with my sovereign whether such only intitle
or in possession his kingdom
 yet loyalty was ever the pride almost the
wnoijstork ol
ruling passion your family alice said the
king
and could i reconcile that loyalty said
alice with indulging my sovereign by permitting
him to prosecute a suit dishonourable to himself
as to me ought i as a faithful subject to
join him in a folly which might throw yet another
stumblingblock in the path to his restoration
and could only serve to diminish his security
even if he were seated upon his throne 
at this rate said charles discontentedly
 i had better have retained my character the
page than assumed that a sovereign which it
seems is still more irreconcilable with my wishes
my candour shall go still farther said alice
i could have felt as little for louis kerneguy
as for the heir britain for such love as i have
to bestow and it is not such as i read in romance
or hear poured forth in song has been
already conferred on another object this gives
your majesty pain i am sorry for it but the
wholesome medicines are often bitter
yes answered the king with some asperity
 and physicians arc reasonable enough to 
woodstock
pet their patients to swallow them as if they
were honeycomb it is true then that whispered
tale the cousin colonel and the daughter
 the loyal lee has set her heart upon a rebellious
fanatic 
 my love was given ere i knew what these
words fanatic and rebel meant i recalled it not
for i am satisfied that amidst the great distractions
which divide the kingdom the person to
whom you allude has chosen his part erroneously
perhaps but conscientiously he therefore has
still the highest place in my affection and esteem
more he cannot have and will not ask until some
happy turn shall reconcile these public differences
and my father be once more reconciled to him
devoutly do i pray that such an event may occur
by your majesty s speedy and unanimous restoration

 you have found out a reason said the
king pettishly to make me detest the thought
 such a change nor have you alice any sincere
interest to pray for it on the contrary do
you not see that your lover walking side by side
with cromwell may or rather must share lii
woodstock 
power nay if lambert does not anticipate him
he may trip up oliver's heels and reign in his
stead and think you not he will find means to
overcome the pride the loyal lees and achieve
an union for which things are better prepared than
that which cromwell is said to meditate betwixt
one his brat and the no less loyal heir fauconcern

your majesty said alice has found a
way at length to avenge yourself if what i have
said deserves vengeance
i could point out a yet shorter road to your
union said charles without minding her distress
or perhaps enjoying the pleasure retaliation
 suppose that you sent your colonel word
that there was one charles stuart here who had
come to disturb the saints in their peaceful government
which they had acquired by prayer
and preaching pike and gun and suppose he
had the art to bring down a halfscore troopers
quite enough as times go to decide the fate 
this heir royalty think you not the possession
 such a prize as this might obtain from the
bumpers or from cromwell such a reward as
 woodstock
might overcome your father's objections to a
roundhead's alliance and place the fair alice and
her cousin colonel in full possession their
wishes 
my lord said alice her cheeks glowing and
her eyes sparkling for she too had her share 
the hereditary temperament her family this
passes my patience i have heard without expressing
anger the most ignominious persuasions
addressed to myself and i have vindicated myself
for refusing to be the paramour a fugitive
prince as if i had been excusing myself from accepting
a share an actual crown but can you
think i can hear all who are dear to me slandered
without emotion or reply i will not sir and
were you seated with all the terrors your father's
starchamber around you you should hear
me defend the absent and the innocent my
father i will say nothing but that if he is now
without wealth without state almost without a
sheltering home and needful food it is because he
spent all in the service the king he needed
not to commit any act treachery or villainy to
obtain wealth he had an ample competence in
wooisiock 
his own possessions for markham everard he
knows no such thing as selfishness he would not
for broad england had she the treasures peru
in her bosom and a paradise on her surface do a
deed that would disgrace his own name or injure
the feelings another kings my lord may
take a lesson from him my lord for the present
i take my leave
alice alice stay exclaimed the king
 she is gone this must be virtue real disinterested
overawing virtue or there is no such
thing on earth yet wilmot and villiers will
not believe a word it but add the tale to the
other wonders woodstock tis a rare wench 
and i profess to use the colonel's obtestation
that i know not whether to forgive and be friends
with her or study a dire revenge if it were not
for that accursed cousin that puritan colonel
i could forgive everything else to so noble a
wench but a roundheaded rebel preferred to me
the preference avowed to my face and justified
with the assertion that a king might take a lesson
from him it is gall and wormwood if the old
man had not come up this morning as he did the
 woodstock
king should have taken or given a lesson and a
severe one it was a mad rencontre to venture
upon with my rank and responsibility and yet
this wench has made me so angry with her and
so envious him that if an opportunity offered
i should scarce be able to forbear him ha 
whom have we here 
the interjection at the conclusion this royal
soliloquy was occasioned by the unexpected entrance
 another personage the drama
woodstock 
chapter iii
benedict shall i speak a word in your ear 
claudia god bless me from a challenge
much ado about nothing
as charles was about to leave the apartment
he was prevented by the appearance wildrake
who entered with an unusual degree swagger
in his gait and fantastic importance on
his brow i crave your pardon fair sir he
said but as they say in my country when
doors are open dogs enter i have knocked and
called in the hall to no purpose so knowing the
way to this parlour sir for i am a light partizan
and the road i once travel i never forget
i ventured to present myself unannounced
 sir henry lee is abroad sir i believe in
the chase said charles coldly for the appearance
 this somewhat vulgar debauchee was not
agreeable to him at the moment and master
 woodstock
albert lee has left the lodge for two or three
days
i am aware it sir said wildrake but
i have no business at present with either
and with whom is your business said
charles that is if i may be permitted to ask
since i think it cannot in possibility be with
me
pardon me in turn sir answered the cavalier
 in no possibility can it be imparted to any
other but yourself if you be as i think you are
though in something better habit master louis
girnigo the scottish gentleman who waits upon
master albert lee
i am all you are like to find for him answered
charles
in truth said the cavalier i do perceive
a difference but rest and better clothing will do
much and i am glad it since i would be
sorry to have brought a message such as i am
charged with to a tatterdemalion
let us get to the business sir if you please
said the king you have a message for me
you say 
woodstock 
true sir replied wildrake i am the
friend colonel markham everard sir a tall
man and a worthy person in the field although
i could wish him a better cause a message i
have to you it is certain in a slight note which
i take the liberty presenting with the usual
formalities so saying he drew his sword put
the billet he mentioned upon the point and making
a profound bow presented it to charles
the disguised monarch accepted it with a
grave return the salute and said as he was
about to open the letter i am not i presume
to expect friendly contents in an epistle presented
in so hostile a manner 
a hem sir replied the ambassador clearing
his voice while he arranged a suitable answer
in which the mild strain diplomacy might
be properly maintained not utterly hostile i
suppose sir is the invitation though it be such as
must be construed in the commencement rather
bellicose and pugnacious i trust sir we shall
find that a few thrusts will make a handsome conclusion
 the business and so as my old master
used to say pax nascitur ex bello for my own
 woodstock
poor share i am truly glad to have been graced
by my friend markham everard in this matter 
the rather as i feared the puritan principles with
which he is embued i will confess the truth to
you worthy sir might have rendered him unwilling
from certain scruples to have taken the
gentlemanlike mode righting himself in such
a case as the present and as i render a friend's
duty to my friend so i humbly hope master
louis girnigo that i do no injustice to you in
preparing the way for the proposed meeting
where give me leave to say i trust that if no
fatal accident occur we shall be all better friends
when the skirmish is over than we were before it
began
i should suppose so sir in any case said
charles looking at the letter worse than mortal
enemies we can scarce be and it is that footing
upon which this billet places us
 you say true sir said wildrake it is
sir a cartel introducing to a single combat for
the pacific object restoring a perfect good understanding
betwixt the survivors in case that
fortunately that word can be used in the plural
after the event the meeting
woodstock 
in short wc only fight i suppose replied
the king that we may come to a perfectly
good and amicable understanding
you are right again sir and i thank you for
the clearness your apprehension said wildrake
 ah sir it is easy to do with a person 
honour and intellect in such a case as this and
i beseech you sir as a personal kindness to myself
that as the morning is like to be frosty and
myself am in some sort rheumatic as war will
leave its scars behind sir i say i will entreat
 you to bring with you some gentleman honour
who will not disdain to take a part what
is going forward a sort potluck sir with
a poor old soldier like myself that we may take
no harm by standing unoccupied during such
cold weather
i understand sir replied charles if this
matter goes forward be assured i will endeavour
to provide you with a suitable opponent
i will remain greatly indebted to you sir
said wildrake and i am by no means curious
about the quality my antagonist it is true
i write myself esquire and gentleman and should
woodstock
account myself especially honoured by crossing
my sword with that sir henry or master
albert lee but should that not be convenient
i will not refuse to present my poor person in
opposition to any gentleman who has served the
king which i always hold as a sort letters 
nobility in itself and therefore would on no account
decline the duello with such a person
the king is much obliged to you sir said
charles for the honour you do his faithful
subjects
o sir i am scrupulous on that point very
scrupulous when there is a roundhead in
question i consult the herald's books to see
that he is entitled to bear arms as is master
markham everard without which i promise
you i had borne none his cartel but a cavalier
is with me a gentleman course be his
birth ever so low his loyalty has ennobled his
condition
it is well sir said the king this paper
requests me to meet master everard at six
tomorrow morning at the tree called the king's
oak i object neither to place nor time he
proffers the sword at which he says we possess
woodstock 
some equality i do not decline the weapon 
for company two gentlemen i shall endeavour
to procure myself an associate and a suitable
partner for you sir if you incline to join in die
dance
i kiss your hand sir and rest yours under
a sense obligation answered the envoy
i thank you sir continued the king i
will therefore be ready at place and time and
suitably furnished and i will either give your
friend such satisfaction with my sword as he requires
or will render him such cause for not doing
so as he shall be contented with
you will excuse me sir said wildrake
if my mind is too dull under the circumstances
to conceive any alternative that can remain betwixt
two men honour in such a case excepting
sa sa he threw himself into a fencing
position and made a pass with his sheathed
rapier but not directed towards the person 
the king whom he addressed
excuse me sir said charles if i do not
trouble your intellects with consideration a
case which may not occur but for example
woodstock
i may plead urgent employment on the part 
the public this he spoke in a low and mysterious
tone voice which wildrake appeared
perfectly to comprehend for he laid his forefinger
on his nose with what he meant for a very
intelligent and apprehensive nod
sir said he if you be engaged in any
affair for the king ray friend shall have every
reasonable degree patience nay i will fight
him myself in your stead merely to stay his stomach
rather than you should be interrupted 
and sir if you can find room in your enterprise
for a poor gentleman that has followed langford
and goring you have but to name day time
and place rendezvous for truly sir i am
tired the scald hat cropped hair and undertakers's
cloak with which my friend has bedizened
me and would willingly ruffle it out once
more in the king's cause when whether i be
banged or hanged i care not
i shall remember what you say sir should
an opportunity occur said the king and i
wish his majesty had many such subjects i
presume our business is now settled 
woodstock 
when you shall have been pleased sir to
give me a trifling scrap writing to serve for my
credentials for such you know is the custom 
your written cartel hath its written answer
that sir will i presently do said charles
and in good time here are the materials
and sir continued the envoy ahi 
ahem if you have interest in the household
for a cup sack i am a man few words
and am somewhat hoarse with much speaking
moreover a serious business this kind always
makes one thirsty besides sir to part
with dry lips argues malice which god forbid
should exist in such an honourable conjuncture
i do not boast much influence in the house
sir said the king but if you would have the
condescension to accept this broad piece towards
quenching your thirst at the george 
sir said the cavalier for the times admitted
 this strange species courtesy nor was
wildrake a man such peculiar delicacy as
keenly to dispute the matter i am once again
beholden to you but i see not how it consists
vol in e
 woodstock
with my honour to accept such accommodation
unless you were to accompany and partake
pardon me sir replied charles my safety
recommends that i remain rather private at
present
enough said wildrake observed poor
cavaliers must not stand on ceremony i see sir
you understand cutter's law when one tall fellow
has coin another must not be thirsty i wish
you sir a continuance health and happiness
until tomorrow at the king's oak at six o'clock
farewell sir said the king and added as
wildrake went down the stair whistling hey
for cavaliers to which air his long rapier jarring
against the steps and bannisters bore no unsuitable
burthen farewell thou too just emblem
 the state to which war and defeat and despair
have reduced many a gallant gentleman
during the rest the day there occurred nothing
peculiarly deserving notice alice sedulously
avoided showing towards the disguised
prince any degree estrangement or shyness
which could be discovered by her father or by
any one else to all appearance the two young
woodstock 
persons continued on the same footing in every
respect yet she made the gallant himself sensible
that this apparent intimacy was assumed
merely to save appearances and in no way designed
as retracting from the severity with which
she had rejected his suit the sense that this
was the case joined to his injured selflove and
his enmity against a successful rival induced
charles early to withdraw himself to a solitary
walk in the wilderness where like hercules in
the emblem ceres divided betwixt the personifications
 virtue and pleasure he listened
alternately to the voice wisdom and passionate
folly
prudence urged to him the importance his
own life to the future prosecution the great object
in which he had for the present miscarried 
the restoration monarchy in england the rebuilding
 the throne the regaining the crown 
his father the avenging his death and restoring
to their fortunes and their country the numerous
exiles who were suffering poverty and banishment
on account their attachment to his cause pride
too or rather a just and natural sense dignity
woodstock
displayed the unworthiness a prince descending
to actual personal conflict with a subject any
degree and the ridicule which would be thrown
on his memory should he lose his life for an obscure
intrigue by the hand a private gentleman
what would his sage counsellors nicholas
and hyde what would his kind and wise governor
the marquis hertford say to such an act
 rashness and folly would it not be likely to
shake the allegiance the staid and prudent persons
 the royalist party since wherefore should
they expose their lives and estates to raise to the
government a kingdom a young man who could
not command his own temper to this was to
be added the consideration that even his success
would add double difficulties to his escape which
already seemed sufficiently precarious if stopping
short death he merely had the better 
his antagonist how did he know that he might
not seek revenge b delivering up to government
the malignant louis kerneguy whose real character
could not in that case fail to be discovered 
these considerations strongly recommended to
charles that he should clear himself the chap
woodstock 
ienge without fighting and the reservation under
which he had accepted it afforded him some
opportunity doing so
but passion also had her arguments which she
addressed to a temper rendered irritable by recent
distress and mortification in the first place
if he was a prince he was also a gentleman entitled
to resent as such and obliged to give or
claim the satisfaction expected on occasion 
differences among gentlemen with englishmen
she urged he could never lose interest by
showing himself ready instead sheltering himself
under his royal birth and pretensions to
come frankly forward and maintain what he
had done or said on his own responsibility ina
free nation it seemed as if he would rather
gain than lose in the public estimation by a conduct
which could not but seem gallant and generous
then a character for courage was far
more necessary to support his pretensions than
any other kind reputation and the lying under
a challenge viithout replying to it might
bring his spirit into question what would valleys
and wilmot say an intrigue in which he
 woodstock
had allowed himself to be shamefully baffled by
a country girl and had failed to revenge himself
on the rival the pasquinades which they would
compose the witty sarcasms which they would
circulate on the occasion would be harder to endure
than the grave rebukes hertford hyde
and nicholas this reflection added to the stings
 youthful and awakened courage at length
fixed his resolution and he returned to woodstock
determined to keep his appointment come
 it what might
perhaps there mingled with his resolution a
secret belief that such a rencontre would not
prove fatal he was in the flower his youth
active in all his exercises and no way inferior to
colonel everard as far as the morning's experiment
had gone in that selfdefence at least
such recollection might pass through his royal
mind as he hummed to himself a wellknown
ditty which he had picked up during his residence
in scotland
a man may drink and not be drunk
a man may fight and not be slain 
a man may kiss a bonnie lass
and yet be welcome back again
woodstock 
meanwhile the busy and alldirecting doctor
rochecliffe had contrived to intimate to alice
that she must give him a private audience and
she found him by appointment in what was called
the study once filled with ancient books which
long since converted into cartridges had made
more noise in the world at their final exit than
during the space which had intervened betwixt
that and their first publication the doctor
seated himself in a highbacked leathern easychair
and signed to alice to fetch a stool and sit
down beside him
alice said the old man taking her hand affectionately
 thou art a good girl a wise girl a virtuous
girl one those whose price is above rubies
not that rubies is the proper translationbut
remind me to tell you that another time alice
thou knowest who this louis kerneguy islay
hesitate not to me i know everything i am
well aware the whole matter thou knowest
this honoured house holds the fortunes england
alice was about to answer nay speak
not but listen to me alice how does he bear
himself towards you 
 woodstock
alice coloured with the deepest crimsoned i
am a countrybred girl she said and his manners
are too courtlike for me
enough said i know it all alice he is
exposed to a great danger tomorrow and you
must be the happy means to prevent him
 i prevent him how and in what manner 
said alice in surprise it is my duty as a
subject to do anything anything that may become
my father's daughters
here she stopped considerably embarrassed
yes continued the doctor tomorrow he
hath made an appointment an appointment with
markham everard the hour and place are setsix
in the morning by the kings oak if they
meet one will probably fall
now may god forefend they should meet
said alice turning as suddenly pale as she had
previously reddened but harm cannot come 
it everard will never lift his sword against the
king
for that said doctor rochechffe i
would not warrant but if that unhappy young
gentleman shall have still some reserve the
woodstock 
loyalty which his general conduct entirely disavows
it would not serve us here for he knows
not the king but considers him merely as a cavalier
from whom he has received injury
let him know the truth doctor rochecliffs
let him know it instantly said alice he
lift hand against the king a fugitive and defenceless
 he is incapable it my life on the
issue he becomes most active in his preservation

 that is the thought a maiden alice
answered the doctor and as i fear a maiden
whose wisdom is misled by her affections it
were worse than treason to admit a rebel officer
the friend the archtraitor cromwell into so
great a secret i dare not answer for such rashness
hammond was trusted by his father and
you know what came it
then let my father know he will meet markham
or send to him representing the indignity
done to him by attacking his guest
we dare not let your father into the secret
who louis kerneguy really is i did but hint
 woodstock
the possibility charles taking refuge at woodstock
and the rapture into which sir henry broke
out the preparations for accommodation and defence
which he began to talk plainly showed
that the mere enthusiasm his loyalty would
have led to a risk discovery it is you alice
who must save the hopes every true royalist
i answered alice it is impossible 
why cannot my father be induced to interfere
as in behalf his friend and guest though he
know him as no other than louis kerneguy 
you have forgot your father's character my
young friend said the doctor an excellent
man and the best christians till there is a
clashing swords and then he starts up the
complete martialist as deaf to every pacific reasoning
as if he were a gamecock
you forget doctor rochechffe said alice
that this very morning if i understand the
thing aright my father prevented them from
fighting
ay answered the doctor because he deemed
himself bound to keep the peace in the royal
park but it was done with such regret alice
woodstock 
that should he find them at it again i am clear
to foretell he will only so far postpone the combat
as to conduct them to some unprivileged
ground and there bid them tilt and welcome
while he regaled his eyes with a scene so pleasing
no alice it is you and you only who can
help us in this extremity
 i see no possibility said she again colouring
 how i can be the least use
you must send a note answered doctor
rochecliffe to the king a note such as all
women know how to write better than any man
can teach them to meet you at the precise hour
 the rendezvous he will not fail you for i
know his unhappy foible
doctor rochecliffe said alice gravely
you have known me from infancy what have
you seen in me to induce you to believe that i
should ever follow such unbecoming counsel 
 and if you have known me from infancy
retorted the doctor what have you seen me
that you should suspect me giving counsel to
my friend's daughter which it would be misbecoming
in her to follow you cannot be foot
 woodstock
enough i think to suppose that i mean you
should carry your complaisance farther than to
keep him in discourse for an hour or two till i
have all in readiness for his leaving this place
from which i can fright him by the terrors an
alleged search so c s mounts his horse and
rides off and mistress alice lee has the honour
 saving him
yes at the expense her own reputation
said auce and the risk an eternal stain on
my family you say you know all what can
the king think my appointing an assignation
with him after what has passed and how will it
be possible to disabuse him respecting the purpose
 my doing so 
i will disabuse him alice i will explain
the whole
doctor rochecliffe said alice you propose
what is impossible you can do much by
your ready wit and great wisdom but if newfallen
snow were once sullied not all your art
could wash it white again and it is altogether
the same with a maiden's reputation
alice my dearest child said the doctor
woodstock 
 bethink you that if i recommend this means 
saving the ife the king at least rescuing him
from instant peril it is because i see no other 
which to avail myself if i bid you assume even
for a moment the semblance what is wrong
it is but in the last extremity and under circumstances
which cannot return i will take the
surest means to prevent all evil report which can
arise from what i recommend
say not so doctor said alice better
undertake to turn back the isis than to stop the
course calumny the king will make boast
to his whole licentious court the ease with
which but for a sudden alarm he could have
brought off alice lee as a paramour the mouth
which confers honour on others will then be the
means to deprive me mine take a fitter
course one more becoming your own character
and profession do not lead him to fail in an
engagement honour by holding out the prospect
 another engagement equally dishonourable
whether false or true go to the king himself
speak to him as the servants god have a
right to speak even to earthly sovereigns point
 woodstock
out to him the folly and the wickedness the
course he is about to pursue urge upon him
that he fear the sword since wrath bringeth the
punishment the sword tell him that the
friends who died for him in the field at worcester
on the scaffolds and on the gibbets since
that bloody day that the remnant who are in
prison scattered fled and ruined on his account
deserve better him and his father's race than
that he should throw away his life in an idle
brawl tell him that it is dishonest to venture
that which is not his own dishonourable to betray
the trust which brave men have reposed in
his virtue and in his courage
doctor rochecliffe looked on her with a melancholy
smile his eyes glistening as he said
alas alice even i could not plead that just
cause to him so eloquently or so impressively as
thou dost but alack charles would listen to
neither it is not from priests or women he
would say that men should receive counsel in
affairs honour
then hear me doctor rochecliffe i will
appear at the place rendezvous and i will
woodstock 
prevent the combat do not fear that i can do
what i say at a sacrifice indeed but not that
 my reputation my heart may be broken
she endeavoured to stifle her sobs with difficulty
 for the consequence but not in the imagination
 a man and far less that man her sovereign
shall a thought alice lee be associated
with dishonour she hid her face in her handkerchief
and burst out into unrestrained tears
what means this hysterical passion said
doctor rochecliffe surprised and somewhat
alarmed by the vehemence her grief maiden
i must have no concealments i must know
 exert your ingenuity then and discover
it said alice for a moment displeased at the
doctor's pertinacious selfimportance guess
my purpose as you can guess at everything
else it is enough to have to go through my
task i will not endure the distress telling it
over and that to one who forgive me dear
doctor might not think ray agitation on this
occasion fully warranted
nay then my young mistress you must be
ruled said rochecliffe and if i cannot make

 woodstock
you explain yourself i must see whether your
father can gain so far on you so saying he
arose somewhat displeased and walked towards
the door
you forget what you yourself told me doctor
rochecliffe said alice the risk communicating
this great secret to my father
it is too true he said stopping short and
turning round and i think wench thou art
too smart for me and i have not met many such
but thou art a good girl and wilt tell me thy
device freewill it concerns my character and
influence with the king that i should be fully 
acquainted with whatever is actum atque tracts
done and treated in this matter
trust your character to me good doctor
said alice attempting to smile it is firmer
stuff than those women and will be safer in my
custody than mine could have been in yours
and thus much i condescend you shall see the
whole scene you shall go with me yourself and
much will i feel emboldened and heartened by
your company
woodstock 
that is something said the doctor though
not altogether satisfied with this limited confidence
 thou wert ever a clever wench and i
will trust thee indeed trust thee i find i must
whether voluntarily or no
meet me then said alice in the wilderness
tomorrow but first tell me are you well
assured time and place a mistake were fatal

assure yourself my information is entirely
accurate said the doctor resuming his air 
consequence which had been a little diminished
during the latter part their conference
may i ask said alice through what channel
you acquired such important information 
you may ask unquestionably he answered
now completely restored to his supremacy but
whether i will answer or not is a very different
question i conceive neither your reputation
nor my own are interested in your remaining in
ignorance on that subject so i have my secrets
as well as you mistress and some them i
fancy are a good deal more worth knowing
be it so said alice quietly if you will
vol ill f
 woodstock
meet me in the wilderness by the broken dial at
half past five exactly we will go together tomorrow
and watch them as they come to the rendezvous
i will on the way get the better my
present timidity and explain to you the means i
design to employ to prevent mischief you can
perhaps think making some effort which may
render my interference unbecoming and painful
as it must be altogether unnecessary
nay my child said the doctor if you
place yourself in my hands you will be the first
that ever had reason to complain my want 
conduct and you may well judge you are the
very last one excepted whom i would see suffer
for want counsel at half past five then at
the dial in the wilderness and god bless our undertaking

here their interview was interrupted by the
sonorous voice sir henry lee which shouted
their names daughter alice doctor rochecliffs
through passage and gallery
what do you here said he entering sitting
like two crows in a mist when we have such
rare sport below here is this wild crackbrained
woodstock 
boy louis kerneguy now making me laugh till
my sides are fit to split and now playing on his
guitar sweetly enough to win a lark from the
heavens come away with you come away it
is hard work to laugh alone
 wood stock
chapter 
this is the iiacc the centre the grove 
here stands the oak the monarch the wood
john home
the sun had risen on the broad boughs 
the forest but without the power penetrating
into its recesses which hung rich with heavy
dewdrops and were beginning on some the
trees to exhibit the varied tints autumn it
being the season when nature ike a prodigal
whose race is well nigh run seems desirous to
make up in profuse gaiety and variety colours
for the short space which her splendour has then
to endure the birds were silent and even
robinredbreast whose chirruping song was
woodstock 
heard among the bushes near the lodge emboldened
by the largesses with which the good old
knight always encouraged his familiarity did not
venture into the recesses the wood alarmed
by the neighbourhood the sparrowhawk and
other enemies a similar description preferring
the vicinity the dwellings man from whom
he almost solely among the feathered tribes
seems to experience disinterested protection
the scene was therefore at once lovely and silent
when the good doctor rochechife wrapped
in a scarlet roquelair which had seen service in
its day muffling his face more from habit than
necessity and supporting alice on his arm she
also defended by a cloak against the cold and
damp the autumn morning glided through
the tangled and long grass the darkest alleys
almost ancledeep in dew towards the place appointed
for the intended duel both so eagerly
maintained the consultation in which they were
engaged that they were alike insensible the
roughness and discomforts the road though
often obliged to force their way through brushwood
and coppice which poured down on thciii
 woodstock
all the liquid pearls with which they were loaded
till the mantles they were wrapped in hung
lank by their sides and clung to their shoulders
heavily charged with moisture they stopped
when they had attained a station under the
coppice and shrouded by it from which they
could see all that passed on the little esplanade
before the king's oak whose broad and scathed
form contorted and shattered limbs and frowning
brows made him appear like some ancient
warworn champion well selected to be the umpire
 a field single combat
the first person who appeared at the rendezvous
was the gay cavalier roger wildrake he
also was wrapped in his cloak but had discarded
his puritanic beaver and wore in its stead a spanish
hat with a feather and gilt hatband all 
which had encountered bad weather and hard
service but to make amends for the appearance
 poverty by the show pretension the castor
was accurately adjusted after what was rather
profanely called the d mme cut used among
the more desperate cavaliers he came very hastily
and exclaimed aloud first in the field
woodstock t
after all by jove though i bilked everard in
order to have my morning draught it has done
me much good he added smacking his lips
well i suppose i should search the ground
ere my principal comes up whose presbyterian
watch trudges as slow as his presbyterian step
he took his rapier from under his cloak and
seemed about to search the thickets around
i will prevent him whispered the doctor
to alice i will keep faith with you you
shall not come on the scene nisi dignus venice
nodus i'll explain that another time vindex
is feminine as well as masculine so the quotation
is defensible keep you close
so saying he stepped forward on the esplanade
and bowed to wiidrake
master louis kerneguy said wiidrake
pulling off his hat but instantly discovering his
error he added but no i beg your pardon
sir fatter shorter older mr kerneguy's
friend i suppose with whom i hope to have a
turn by and by and why not now sir before
our principals come up just a snack to stay the
orifice the stomach till the dinner is served
sir what say you r
 woodstock
to open the orifice the stomach more likely
or to give it a new one said the doctor
 true sir said roger who seemed now in
his element you say well that is as thereafter
may be but come sir you wear your face muffled
i grant you it is honest men's fashion at
this unhappy time the more is the pity but we
do all above board we have no traitors here
i'll get into my gears first to encourage you and
show you that you have to deal with a gentleman
who honours the king and is a match fit to fight
with any who follows him as doubtless you do
sir since you are the friend master louis kern

all this while wildrake was busied undoing
the clasps his squarecaped cloak
 oft off ye lending he said borrowings
i should more properly call you 
via the curtain which shadow'd borgia 
so saying he threw the cloak from him and
appeared in cuerpo in a most cavalierlike doublet
 greasy crimson satin pinked and slashed
with what had been once white tiffany breeches
 the same and nclherstocks or as we now call
woods rock 
iceni stockings darned in many places and which
like those point had been once peachcoloured
a pair pumps ill calculated for a walk
through the dew and a broad shoulderbelt 
tarnished embroidery completed his equipment
 come sir he exclaimed make haste off
with your slough here i stand tight and true
as loyal a lad as ever stuck rapier through a
roundhead come sir to your tools he continued
 we may have halfadozen thrusts before
they come yet and shame them for their tardiness 
pshaw he exclaimed in a most disappointed
tone when the doctor unfolding his cloak showed
his clerical dress tush it's burt the parson
after all 
wildrake's respect for the church however
and his desire to remove one who might possibly
interrupt a scene to which he looked forward
with peculiar satisfaction induced him presently
to assume another tone
i beg pardon he said my dear doctor
i kiss the hem your cassock i do by the
thundering jove i beg your pardon again 
jut i am happy i have met with you they
arc initio for your presence a the i
said the doctor i wait for master louis kern

the devil you do exclaimed wildrake
why i always knew the scots could do nothing
without their minister but d n it i never
thought they put them to this use neither
but i have known jolly customers in orders who
wooustock 
understood to handle the sword as well as their
prayerbook you know the purpose our
meeting doctor do you come only as a ghostly
comforter or as a surgeon perhapsor do you
ever take bilboa in hand sa sa 
here he made a fencing demonstration with
his sheathed rapier
i have done so sir on necessary occasion
said doctor rochecliffe
good sir let this stand for a necessary one
said wildrake you know my devotion for
the church if a divine your skill would dome
the honour to exchange but three passes with
me i should think myself happy for ever
sir said rochecliffe smiling were there
no other objection to what you propose i have
not the means i have no weapon
what you want the de quoi that is unlucky
indeed but you have a stout cane in your
hand what hinders our trying a pass my rapier
being sheathed course until our principals
come up my pumps are full this frostdew
 and i shall be a toe or two out pocket
if i am to stand still all the time they are stretches
voustock
ing themselves for i fancy doctor you will be
 my opinion that the matter will not be a fight
 cocksparrows
my business here is to make it if possible
be no fight at all said the divine
now rat me doctor but that is too spiteful
said wildrake and were it not for my
respect for the church i could turn presbyterian
to be revenged
stand back a little if you please sir said
the doctor do not press forward in that direction
 for wildrake in the agitation his
movements induced by his disappointment approached
the spot where alice remained still concealed

and wherefore not i pray you doctor
said the cavalier
but on advancing a step he suddenly stopped
short and muttered to himself with a round oath
 astonishment a petticoat in the coppice by
all that is reverend and at this hour in the morning
 wheiv ew ew he gave vent to his
surprise in a long low interjectional whistle then
turning to the doctor with his finger on the side
woodstock 

 his nose youve sly doctor d d sly but
why not give me a hint your your commodity
there your contraband goods gad sir i
am not a man to expose the eccentricities the
church
sir said doctor rochecliffe you are impertinent
 and if time served and it were worth
my while i would chastise you
and the doctor who had served long enough
in the wars to have added some the qualities
 a captain horse to those the divine actually
raised his cane to the infinite delight 
the rake whose respect for the church was by no
means able to subdue his love mischief
nay doctor said he if you wield your
weapon backswordfashion in that way and raise
it as high as your head i shall be through you
in a twinkling so saying he made a pass with
his sheathed rapier not precisely at the doctor's
person but in that direction when rochecliffe
changing the direction his cane from the broadsword
guard to that the rapier made the cavaliers
sword spring ten yards out his hand
with all the dexterity my friend francalanza
 woodstock
at this moment both the principal parties appeared
on the field
everard exclaimed angrily to wildrake is
this your friendship in heaven's name what
make you in that doors jacket and playing the
pranks a jackpudding while his worthy second
somewhat crestfallen held down his head
like a boy caught in roguery and went to pick up
his weapon stretching his head as he passed into
the coppice to obtain another glimpse if possible
 the concealed object his curiosity
charles in the meantime still more surprised
at what he beheld called out on his part
 what doctor rochecliffe become literally one
 the church militant and tilting with my friend
cavalier wildrake may i use the freedom to
ask him to withdraw as colonel everard and i
have some private business to settle
it was doctor rochecliffes cue on this important
occasion to have armed himself with the
authority his sacred office and used a tone 
interference which might have overawed even a
monarch and made him feel that his monitor
spoke by a warrant higher than his own but the
woodstock 
indiscreet latitude lie had just given to his own
passion and the levity in which he had been detected
were very unfavourable to his assuming
that superiority to which so uncontrollable a spirit
as that charles wilful as a prince and
capricious as a wit was at all likely to submit
the doctor did however endeavour to rally his
dignity and replied with the gravest and at the
same time the most respectful tone he could assume
that he also had business the most urgent
nature which prevented him from complying
with master kerneguy's wishes and leaving
that spot
excuse this untimely interruption said
charles taking off his hat and bowing to colonel
everard which i will immediately put an
 to
everard gravely returned his salute and was
silent
are you mad doctor rochecliff'e said
charles or are you deaf or have you forgotten
your mothertongue i desired you to
leave this place
i am not mad said the divine rousing up
c woodstofif
his resolution and regaining the natural firmness
 his voice i would prevent others from being
so i am not deaf i would pray others to
hear the voice reason and religion i have
not forgotten my mothertongue but i have
come hither to speak the language the master
 kings and princes
to fence with broomsticks i should rather
suppose said the king come doctor rochecliffs
this sudden fit assumed importance befits
you as little as your late frolic you are not
i apprehend either a catholic priest or a scotch
mass john to claim devoted obedience from
your hearers but a church englishman
subject to the rules that communion and to
its head in speaking the last words the king
lowered his voice to a low and impressive whisper
everard observing this drew back the natural
generosity his temper directing him to avoid
overhearing private discourse in which the safety
 the speakers might be deeply concerned
they continued however to observe great caution
in their forms expression
master kerneguy said the clergyman it
woodstock 
is not i who assume authority or control over
your wishes god forbid i do but tell you
what reason scripture religion and morality
alike prescribe for your rule conduct
and i doctor said the king smiling and
pointing to the unlucky cane will take your
example rather than your precept if a reverend
clergyman will himself fight a bout at singlestick
what right can he have to interfere in gentlemen's
quarrels come sir remove yourself
and do not let your present obstinacy cancel former
obligations
bethink yourself said the divine i can
say one word which will prevent all this
 do it replied the king and in doing
so belie the whole tenor and actions an honourable
life abandon the principles your
church and become a perjured traitor and an
apostate to prevent another person from discharging
his duty as a gentleman this were indeed
killing your friend to prevent the risk 
his running himself into danger let the passive
obedience which is so often in your mouth
and no doubt in your head put your feet for
vol m c
 woodstock
once into motion and step aside for ten minutes
within that space your assistance may be needed
either as bodycurer or soulcurer
nay then said doctor rochechffe i have
but one argument left
while this conversation was carried on apart
everard had almost forcibly detained by his
own side his follower wildrake whose greater
curiosity and lesser delicacy would otherwise
have thrust him forward to get if possible into
the secret but when he saw the doctor turn into
the coppice he whispered eagerly to everard
 a gold carolus to a commonwealth farthing
the doctor has not only come to preach a peace
but has brought the principal conditions along
with him 
everard made no answer he had already
unsheathed his sword and charles hardly saw
rochecliffe's back fairly turned than he lost no
time in following his example but ere they
had done more than salute each other with the
usual courteous flourish their weapons doctor
rochecliffe again stood between them leading
in his hand alice lee her garments dank
woodstock 
with lew and her long hair heavy with moisture
and totally uncurled her face was extremely
pale but it was the paleness desperate
resolution not fear there was a dead
pause astonishment the combatants rested
on their swords and even the forwardness 
wildrake only vented itself in half suppressed
ejaculations as well done doctor this beats
the parson among the pease no less than
your patron's daughter and mistress alice
whom i thought a very snowdrop turned out a
dogviolet after all a lindabrides by heavens
and altogether one ourselves 
excepting these unheeded muttering alice
was the first to speak
master everard she said master kern
you are surprised to see me here yet
why should i not tell the reason at once convinced
that i am however guiltlessly the unhappy
cause your misunderstanding i am too much
interested to prevent fatal consequences to pause
upon any step which may it master kerneguy
have my wishes my entreaties my prayers
have your noble thoughts the recollections 
your own high duties no weight with you in this
woodstock
matter let me entreat you to consult reason
religion and common sense and return your
weapon
 i am obedient as an eastern slave madam
answered charles sheathing his sword but i
assure you the matter about which you distress
yourself is a mere trifle which will be much better
settled betwixt colonel everard and myself
in five minutes than with the assistance the
m'hole convocation the church with a female
parliament to assist their reverend deliberations
mr everard will you oblige me by walking
a little further we must change ground it
seems
i am ready to attend you sir said everard
who had sheathed his sword so soon as his
antagonist did so
i have then no interest with you sir said
alice continuing to address the king do
you not fear i should use the secret in my power
to prevent this affair going to extremity think
you this gentleman who raises his hand against
you if he knew 
if he knew diet i were lord wilmot madam
you would say accident has given him
woodstock 
proof lo that effect with which he is already satisfied
and i think you would find it difficult to
induce him to embrace a different opinion
alice paused and looked on the king with
great indignation the following words dropping
from her mouth by intervals as if they burst forth
one by one in spite feelings that would have
restrained them cold selfish ungrateful 
unkind woe to the land which here
she paused with marked emphasis then added
 which shall number thee or such as thee
among her nobles and rulers 
nay fair alice said charles whose good
nature could not but feel the severity this reproach
though too slightly to make all the desired
impression you are too unjust to me too partial
to a happier man do not call me unkind 
i am but here to answer mr everard's summons
i could neither decline attending nor withdraw
now i am here without loss honour and my
loss honour would be a disgrace which must
extend to many i cannot fly from mr everard
it would be too shameful if he abides by m
los woodstock
message it must be decided as such affairs usually
are if he retreats or yields it up i will for
your sake wave punctilio i will not even ask
an apology for the trouble it has afforded me
but let all pass as if it were the consequence 
some unhappy mistake the grounds which
shall remain on my part inquired into this
i will do for your sake and it is much for a man
 honour to condescend so far you know that
the condescension from me in particular is great
indeed then do not call me ungenerous or
ungrateful or unkind since i am ready to do
all which as a man i can do and more perhaps
than as a man honour i ought to do
do you hear this markham everard exclaimed
alice do you hear this the dreadful
option is left entirely at your disposal you
were wont to be temperate in passion religious
forgiving will you for a mere punctilio drive
on this private and unchristian broil to a murderous
extremity believe me if you now contrary
to all the better principles your life give the
reins to your passions the consequences may be
woodstock 
such as you will rue for your lifetime and even
if heaven have not mercy rue after your life is
finished
markham everard remained for a moment
gloomily silent with his eyes fixed on the ground
at length he looked up and answered her
alice you are a soldier's daughter a soldier's
sister all your relations even including one
whom you then entertained some regard for have
been made soldiers by these unhappy discords
yet you have seen them take the field in some
instances on contrary sides to do their duty where
their principles called them without manifesting
this extreme degree interest answer me 
and your answer shall decide my conduct is
this youth so short while known already more
value to you than those dear connexions father
brother and kinsman whose departure to battle
you saw with comparative indifference say this
and it shall be enough i leave the ground never
to see you or this country again
 stay markham stay and believe me when
i say that if i answer your question in the affirmative
it is because master kerneguy's safety
 woods k
comprehends more much more than that any
 those you have mentioned
 indeed i did not know a coronet had been
so superior in value to the crest a private gentleman
said everard yet i have heard that
many women think so
you apprehend me amiss said alice perplexed
between the difficulty so expressing
herself as to prevent immediate mischief and at
the same time anxious to combat the jealousy
and disarm the resentment which she saw arising
in the bosom her lover but she found no
words fine enough to draw the distinction without
leading to a discovery the king's actual
character and perhaps in consequence to his destruction
 markham she said have compassion
on me press me not at this moment
believe me the honour and happiness my
father my brother and my whole family
are interested in master kerneguy's safety are
inextricably concerned in this matter resting
where it now does
oh ay i doubt not said everard the
house lee ever looked up to nobility and
woodstock 
valued in their connexions the fantastic loyalty
 a courtier beyond the sterling and honest patriotism
 a plain country gentleman for them
the thing is in course but on your part you
alice o on your part whom i have loved so
dearly who have suffered me to think that my
affection was not unpaid can the attractions
 an empty title the idle court compliments 
a mere man quality during only a few hours
lead you to prefer a libertine lord to such a heart
as mine 
no no believe me no said alice in the
extremity distress
put your answer which seems so painful
in one word and say for whose safety it is you
are thus deeply interested 
for both for both said alice
that answer will not serve alice answered
everard here is no room for equality i
must and will know to what i have to trust i
understand not the paltering which makes a
maiden unwilling to decide betwixt two suitors 
nor would i willingly impute to you the vanity
that cannot remain contented with one lover at
once
 woodstock
the vehemence everard's displeasure when
he supposed his own long and sincere devotion
lightly forgotten amid the addresses a profligate
courtier awakened the spirit alice lee
who as we elsewhere said had a portion in her
temper the lionhumour that was characteristic
 her family
 if i am thus misinterpreted she said if
i am not judged worthy the least confidence
or candid construction hear my declaration and
my assurance that strange as my words may
seem they are when truly interpreted such as
do you no wrong i tell you i tell all present
and i tell this gentleman himself who well
knows the sense in which i speak that his life
and safety are or ought to be more value tome
than those any other man in the kingdomnay
in the world be that other who he will
these words she spoke in a tone so firm and
decided as admitted no farther discussion
charles bowed low and with gravity but remained
silent everard his features agitated by
the emotions which his pride barely enabled him
to suppress advanced to his antagonist and said
woodstock 
in a tone which he vainly endeavoured to make
a firm one sir you heard the lady's declaration
with such feelings doubtless gratitude
as the case eminently demands as her
poor kinsman and an unworthy suitor sir i
presume to yield my interest in her to you and
as i will never be the means giving her pain
i trust you will not think i act unworthily in
retracting the letter which gave you the trouble
 attending this place at this hour alice he
said turning his head towards her farewell
alice at once and for ever 
the poor young lady whose adventitious spirit
had almost deserted her attempted to repeat
the word farewell but failing in the attempt only
accomplished a broken and imperfect sound and
would have sunk to the ground but for doctor
rochecliffe who caught her as she fell roger
wildrake also who had twice or thrice put to
his eyes what remained a kerchief interested
by the lady's evident distress though unable to
comprehend the mysterious cause hastened to
assist the divine in supporting so fair a burthen
meanwhile the disguised prince had beheld the
 oolsl' k
whole in silence but with an agitation to which
he was unwonted and which his swarthy features
and still more his motions began to betray
his posture was at first absolutely stationary with
his arms folded on his bosom as one who waits
to be guided by the current events presently
after he shifted his position advanced and retired
his foot clenched and opened his hand and
otherwise showed symptoms that he was strongly
agitated by contending feelings was on the point
too forming some sudden resolution and yet
still in uncertainty what course he should pursue
but when he saw markham everard after
one look unspeakable anguish towards alice
turning his back to depart he broke out into his
familiar ejaculation odds fish i this must not
be in three strides he overtook the slowlyretiring
everard tapped him smartly on the
shoulder and as he turned round said with an
air command which he well knew how to
adopt at pleasure one word with you sir
at your pleasure sir replied everard
and naturally conjecturing the purpose his antagonist
to be hostile took hold his rapier with
woodstock 
the left hand and laid the right on the hilt not
displeased at the supposed call for anger is at
least as much akin to disappointment as pity is
said to be to love
pshaw answered the king that cannot
be now colonel everard i am charles
stuart 
everard recoiled in the greatest surprise and
next exclaimed impossible it cannot be 
the king scots has escaped from bristol 
my lord wilmot your talents for intrigue are
well known but this will not pass upon me
the king scots master everard replied
charles since you are so pleased to limit
his sovereignty at any rate the eldest son
 the late sovereign britain is now before
you therefore it is impossible he could have
escaped from bristol doctor rochecliffe shall
be my voucher and will tell you moreover that
wilmot is a fair complexion and light hair 
mine you may see is swart as a raven
rochecliffe seeing what was passing abandoned
alice to the care wildrake whose extreme
delicacy in the attempts he made to bring
 woodstock
her back to life formed an amiable contrast to
his usual wildness and occupied him so much
that he remained for the moment ignorant the
disclosure in which he would have been so much
interested as for doctor rochecliffe he came
forward wringing his hands in all the demonstration
 extreme anxiety and with the usual ex 
exclamations attending such a state
peace doctor rochecliffe said the king
with such complete selfpossession as indeed became
a prince we are in the hands i am
satisfied a man honour master everard
must be pleased in finding only a fugitive prince
in the person in whom he thought he had discovered
a successful rival he cannot but be aware
 the feelings which prevented me from taking
advantage the cover which this young lady's
devoted loyalty afforded me at the risk her
own happiness he is the party who is to profit
by my candour and certainly i have a right to
expect that my condition already indifferent
enough shall not be rendered worse by his becoming
privy to it under such circumstances at
any rate the avowal is made and it is for cowoodstock
ill
lonely everard to consider how he is to conduct
himself
oh your majesty my liege my king 
my royal prince exclaimed wildrake who
at length discovering what was passing had
crawled on his knees and seizing the king's
hand was kissing it more like a child mumbling
gingerbread or a lover devouring the yielded
hand his mistress than in the manner in which
such salutations pass at court if my dear
friend mark everard should prove a dog on this
occasion rely on me i will cut his throat on the
spot were i to do the same for myself the moment
afterward 
hush hush my good friend and loyal subject
said the king and compose yourself 
for though i am obliged to put on the prince
for a moment we have not privacy or safety to
receive our subjects in king cambyses vein
everard who had stood for a time utterly
confounded awoke at length like a man from a
dream
sire he said bowing low and with profound
deference if i do not offer you the homage 
 woodstock
a subject with knee and sword it is because
god by whom kings reign has denied you for
the present the power ascending your throne
without rekindling civil war for your safety
being endangered by me let not such an imagination
for an instant cross your mind had i
not respected your person were i not bound to
you for the candour with which yovir noble avowal
has prevented the misery my future life your
misfortunes would have rendered your person as
sacred so far as i can protect it as it could be
esteemed by the most devoted royalist in the
kingdom if your plans are soundly considered
and securely laid think that all which is now
passed is but a dream if they are in such a
state that i can aid them saving my duty to the
commonwealth which will permit me to be privy
to no schemes actual violence your majesty
may command my services
it may be i may be troublesome to you
sir said the king for my fortunes are not such
as to permit me to reject even the most limited
offers assistance but if i can i will dispense
with applying to you i would not willingly put
woodstock 
any man's compassion at war with his sense 
duty on my account doctor i think there will
be no farther taking today either with sword or
cane so we may as well return to the lodge
and leave these looking at alice and everard
 who may have more to say in explanation
 no no exclaimed alice who was now perfectly
come to herself and partly by her own observation
partly from the report dr rochecliffs
comprehended all that had taken place
my cousin everard and i have nothing to explain
he will forgive me for having riddled with
him when i dared not speak plainly and i forgive
him for having read my riddle wrong but
my father has my promise we must not correspond
or converse for the present i return instantly
to the lodge and he to woodstock unless
you sire bowing to the king command his
duty otherwise instant to the town cousin
markham and if danger should approach give
us warning
everard would have delayed her departure
would have excused himself for his unjust suspicion
would have said a thousand things but she
vor tit h
 woodstock
would not listen to him saying for all other answer
 farewell markham till god send better
days 
 she is an angel truth and beauty said
roger wildrake and i like a blasphemous
heretic called her a lindabrides but has your
majesty craving your pardon no commands
for poor hodge wildrake who will blow out his
own or any other man's brains in england to do
your grace a pleasure 
we entreat our good friend wildrake to do
nothing hastily said charles smiling such
brains as his are rare and should not be rashly dispersed
as the like may not be easily collected we
recommend him to be silent and prudent to tilt
no more with loyal clergymen the church 
england and to get himself a new jacket with all
convenient speed to which we beg to contribute
our royal aid when fit time comes we hope to
find other service for him
as he spoke he slid ten pieces into the hand
 poor wildrake who confounded with the excess
 his loyal gratitude blubbered like a child
and would have followed the king had not 

tor rochecliife in few words but peremptory
insisted that he should return with his patron
promising him he should certainly be employed
in assisting the king's escape could an opportunity
be found using his services
be so generous reverend sir and you bind
me to you for ever said the cavalier and i
conjure you not to keep malice against me on
account the foolery you wot 
i have no occasion captain wildrake said
the doctor for i think i had the best it
well then doctor i forgive you on my part
and i pray you for christian charity let me have
a finger in this good service for as i live in hope
 it rely that i shall die disappointment
while the doctor and soldier thus spoke together
charles took leave everard who remained
uncovered while he spoke to him with
his usual grace i need not bid you no longer
be jealous me said the king for i presume
you will scarce think a match betwixt
alice and me which would be too losing a one
on her side for other thoughts the wildest libertine
could not entertain them towards so highminded
a creature and believe me that my sense
 i woodstock
 her merit did not need this last distinguished
proof her truth and loyalty i saw enough
 her from her answers to some idle sallies 
gallantry to know with what a lofty character she
is endowed mr everard her happiness i see
depends on you and i trust you will be the careful
guardian it if we can take any obstacle
out the way your joint happiness be assured
we will use our influence farewell sir if we
cannot be better friends do not at least let us entertain
harder or worse thoughts each other
than we have now
there was something in the manner charles
that was extremely affecting something too in
his condition as a fugitive in the kingdom which
was his own by inheritance that made a direct
appeal to everard's bosom though in contradiction
to the dictates that policy which he
judged it this duty to pursue in the distracted circumstances
 the country he remained as we
have said uncovered and in his manner testified
the highest expression reverence up to the
point when such might seem a symbol allegiance
he bowed so low as almost approach his
lips to the hand charles but he did not kiss
woodstock 
it i would rescue your person sir he said
with the purchase my own life more 
ho stopped short and the king took up his sentence
where it broke off more you cannot do
said charles to maintain an honourable consistency
 but what you have said is enough you
cannot render homage to my proffered hand as
that a sovereign but you will not prevent my
taking yours as a friend if you allow me to call
myself so i am sure as a wellwisher at least
the generous soul everard was touched 
he took the king's hand and pressed it to his
lips
oh he said were better times to come 
bind yourself to nothing dear everard
said the goodnatured prince partaking his emotion
 we reason ill while our feelings are moved
i will recruit no man to his loss nor will i
have my fallen fortunes involve those others
because they have humanity enough to pity my
present condition if better times come why we
will meet again and i hope to our mutual satisfaction
if not as your future fatherinlaw
would say a benevolent smile came over ki
 woodstock
face and accorded not iinmeetly with his glistening
eyes if not this parting was well
made
everard turned away with a deep bow almost
choking under contending feelings the uppermost
 which was a sense the generosity with
which charles at his own imminent risk had
cleared away the darkness that seemed about to
overwhelm his prospects happiness for life 
mixed with a deep sense the perils by which he
was environed he returned to the little town
followed by his attendant wildrake who turned
back so often with weeping eyes and hands clasped
and uplifted as supplicating heaven that
everard was obliged to remind him that his gestures
might be observed by some one and occasion
suspicion
the generous conduct the king during the
closing part this remarkable scene had not
escaped alice's notice and erasing at once from
her mind all resentment charles's former conduct
and all the suspicions they had deservedly
excited awakened in her bosom a sense the
natural goodness his disposition which perwoodstock

mitted her to unite regard for his person with
that reverence for his high office in which she
had been educated as a portion her creed she
felt convinced and delighted with the conviction
that his virtues were his own his libertinism the
fault education or rather want education
and the corrupting advice sycophants and flatterers
she could not know or perhaps did not
in that moment consider that in a soil where no
care is taken to eradicate tares they will outgrow
and smother the wholesome seed even if the last
is more natural to the soil for as doctor rochecliffs
informed her afterwards for her edification
promising as was his custom to explain the
precise words on some future occasion if she would
put him in mind virtus restored ducemqiie 
 vita sine magistri discuntur
the quotations the learned doctor and antiquary were often
left uninterpreted though seldom un communicated owing to his
contempt for those vho did not understand the learned languages
and his dislike to the labour translation for the benefit ladies
and country gentlemen that fair readers and country thanes
may not on this occasion burst in ignorance we add the meaning
 the passage in the text virtue requires the aid a govern
nor and director vices arc learned without a teacher
 woodstock
there was no room for such reflections at present
conscious mutual sincerity by a sort 
intellectual communication through which individuals
are led to understand each other better
perhaps in delicate circumstances than bywords
reserve and simulation appeared to be
now banished from the intercourse between the
king and alice with manly frankness and at
the same time with princely condescension he
requested her exhausted as she was to accept 
his arm on the vay homeward instead that 
doctor rochecliffe and alice accepted his
support with modest humility but without a shadow
 mistrust or fear it seemed as if the last
half hour had satisfied them perfectly with the
character each other and that each had full
conviction the purity and sincerity the
other's intentions
doctor rochecliffe in the meantime had
fallen some four or five paces behind for less
light and active than alice who had besides
the assistance the king's support he was unable
without effort and difficulty to keep up
with the pace charles who then was as we
woodstock 
have elsewhere noticed one the best walkers
in england and was sometimes apt to forget
as great men will that others were inferior to
him in activity
 dear alice said the king but as if the
epithet were entirely fraternal i like your everard
much i would to god he were our determination
 but since that cannot be i am sure
he will prove a generous enemy
may it please you sire said alice modestly
but with some firmness my cousin will never
be your majesty s personal enemy and he
is one the few on whose slightest word you
may rely more than on the oath those who
profess more strongly and formally he is utterly
incapable abusing your majesty's most generous
and voluntary confidence
on my honour i believe so alice replied
the king but odd's fish my girl let majesty
sleep for the present it concerns my safety as
i told your brother lately call me sir then
which belongs alike to king peer knight and
gentleman or rather let me be wild louis kern
again
 woodstock
alice looked down and shook her head that
cannot be please your majesty
 what louis was a saucy companion a
naughty presuming boy and you cannot abide
him well perhaps you are right but we
will wait for doctor rochechffe he said desirous
with goodnatured delicacy to make alice
aware that he had no purpose engaging her in
any discussion which could recall painful ideas
they paused accordingly and again she felt relieved
and grateful
i cannot persuade our fair friend mistress
alice doctor said the king that she must
in prudence forbear using titles respect to me
while there are such very slender means sustaining
it
it is a reproach to earth and to fortune
answered the divine as fast as his recovered
breath would permit him that your most sacred
majesty's present condition should not accord
with the rendering those honours which
are your own by birth and which with god's
blessing on the efforts your loyal subjects i
iiopc to see rendered to you as your hereditary
woodstock 
right by the universal voice the three kingdoms

true doctor replied the king but in
the meanwhile can you expound to mistress
alice lee two lines horace which i have carried
in my thick head several years till now
they have come pat to my purpose as my canny
subjects scotland say if you keep a thing seven
years you are sure to find a use for it at last
telephusdiy so it begins 
 tclephus et peleus cum pauper et exult uterqjic
project ampullas et sesquipedalia verba 
i will explain the passage to mistress alice
lee when she reminds me it or rather he
added recollecting that his ordinary dilatory
answer ought not to be returned when the order
for exposition emanated from his sovereign i
will repeat a poor couplet from my own translation
 the poem 
heroes and kings in exile forced to roam
leave swelling phrase and sevenleagued words at home 
a most admirable version doctors said
 woodstock
charles i feel all its force and particularly
the beautiful rendering sesquipedalia verba
into sevenleagued boots words i mean it reminds
me like half the things i meet with in
this world the contes de commerce uoye 
thus conversing they reached the lodge and
as the king went to his chamber to prepare for
the breakfast summons now impending the idea
crossed his mind wilmot and villiers and
killigrew would laugh at me did they hear a
campaign in which neither man nor woman had
been conquered but odd's fish let them laugh
as they will there is something at my heart
which tells me that for once in my life i have
acted well
that day and the next were spent in tranquillity

which was to announce to him that a

none such was yet in readiness but he learned

two gentlemen verona
it is time we should give some account the
other actors in our drama the interest due to the
principal personages having for some time engrossed
our attention exclusively
we are therefore to inform the reader that
the lingering longings the commissioners who
had been driven forth their proposed paradise
 woodstock not by a cherub indeed but as
they thought by spirits another sort still detained
them in the vicinity they had indeed
left the little borough under pretence indifferent
accommodation the more palpable reasons
were that they entertained some resentment
i
nvoodstock 
against everard as the means their disappointment
and had no mind to reside where their
proceedings could be overlooked by him although
they took leave in terms the utmost respect
they went however no farther than oxford and
remained there as ravens who are accustomed to
witness the chase sit upon a tree or crag at a little
distance and watch the disembowelling the
deer expecting the relics which fall to their share
meantime the university and city but especially
the former supplied them with some means
 employing their various faculties to advantage
until the expected moment when as they hoped
they should either be summoned to windsor or
woodstock should once more be abandoned to
their discretion
bletson to pass the time vexed the souls such
learned and pious divines and scholars as he could
intrude his hateful presence upon by sophistry
atheistical discourse and challenges to them to
impugn the most scandalous theses desborough
one the most brutally ignorant men the period
got himself nominated the head a college
and lost no time in cutting down trees and plum
 woodstock
during plate as for harrison he preached in
full uniform in saint mary's church wearing his
buffcoat boots and spurs as if he were about to
take the field for the fight at arrcageddon and
it was hard to say whether that seat learning
religion and loyalty as it is called by clarendon
was more vexed by the rapine lesbos
the cold scepticism bletson or the frantic
enthusiasm the fifth monarchy champion
ever and anon soldiers under pretence relieving
guard or otherwise went and came betwixt
woodstock and oxford and maintained it
may be supposed a correspondence with trusty
tomkins who though he chiefly resided in the
town woodstock visited the lodge occasionally
and to whom therefore they doubtless trusted
for information concerning the proceedings
there
indeed this man tomkins seemed by some secret
means to have gained the confidence in part
if not in whole almost every one connected with
these intrigues all closeted him all conversed
with him in private those who had the means propitiated
him with gifts those who had not were
vvohisttftck 
been previously imposed upon he pointed them
out to pearson with no farther comment than
was implied in the exclamation the simple
fools
but his assistants began to lose heart and be
discouraged and required all his spirit to raise
theirs he then called their attention to voices
which they seemed to hear before them and urged
these as evidence that they were moving on
the track some enemy the commonwealth
who for the execution his malignant plots
had retreated into these extraordinary fastnesses
the spirits the men became at last downcast
notwithstanding all this encouragement
they spoke to each other in whispers the devils
 woodstock who might be all the while
decoying them forward to a room said to exist
in the palace where the floor revolving on an
axis precipitated those who entered into a bottomless
abyss humgudgeon hinted that he
had consulted the scripture that morning by way
 lot and his fortune had been to alight on the
passage eutychus fell down from the third
loft the energy and authority cromwell
is
iss woodstock
however and the refreshment some food and
strong waters reconciled them to pursuing their
task
nevertheless with all their unwearied exertions
morning dawned on the search before they
had reached doctor rochecliff'e's sitting apartment
into which after all they obtained entrance
by a mode much more difficult than that
which the doctor himself employed but here
their ingenuity was long at fault from the
miscellaneous articles that were strewed around
and the preparations made for food and lodging
it seemed they had gained the very citadel the
labyrinth but though various passages opened
from it they all terminated in places with which
they were already acquainted or communicated
with the other parts the house where their
own sentinels assured them none had passed
cromwell remained long in deep uncertainty
meantime he directed pearson to take charge 
the ciphers and more important papers which
lay on the table though there is little there
he said that i have not already known by
means trusty tomkins honest joseph for
woodstock 
an artful and thoroughpaced agent the like 
thee is not left in england
after a considerable pause during which he
sounded with the pummel his sword almost
every stone in the building and every plank on
the floor the general gave orders to bring the
old knight and doctor rochecliffe to the spot
trusting that he might work out them some
explanation the secrets this apartment
so please your excellency to let me to
deal with them said pearson who was a thoroughpaced
soldier fortune and had been a
buccaneer in the west indies i think that
by a whipcord twitched tight round their forehead
and twisted round with a pistolbut i
could make either the truth start from their lips
or the eyes from their head
 out upon thee pearson said cromwell
with abhorrence we have no warrant for such
cruelty neither as englishmen nor christians
we may slay malignant as we crush noxious
animals but to torture them is a deadly sin for
it is written he made them to be pitied 
those who carried them captive nay i recall
vol iii t
 woodstock
the order even for their examination trusting
that wisdom will be granted us to discover their
most secret devices
there was a pause accordingly during which
an idea seized upon cromwell's imagination 
 bring me hither he said yonder stool 
and placing it beneath one the windows 
which there were two so high in the wall as not
to be accessible from the floor he clambered up
into the entrance the window which was six
or seven feet deep corresponding with the thickness
 the wall come up hither pearson
said the general but ere thou comest double
the guard at the foot the turret called love's
ladder and bid them bring up the other petard
so now come thou hither
the officer however brave in the field was
one those whom a great height strikes with
giddiness and sickness he shrunk back from
the view the precipice on the verge which
cromwell was standing with complete indifference
till the general catching the hand his
follower pulled him forward as far as he would
advance i think said the general i have
woodstock 
found the clew but by this light it is no easy one 
see you we stand in the portal near the top 
rosamond's tower and yon turret which rises
opposite to our feet is that which is called lover's
ladder from which the drawbridge reached
that admitted the profligate norman tyrant to
the bower his mistress
true my lord but the drawbridge is gone
said pearson
ay pearson replied the general but
an active man might spring from the spot we
stand upon to the battlements yonder turret
i do not think so my lord said pearson
what said cromwell not if the avenger
 blood were behind you with his slaughterweapon
in his hand 
the fear death might do much answered
pearson but when i look at that sheer depth
on either side and at the empty chasm between us
and yonder turret which is i warrant you twelve
feet distant i confess the truth nothing short 
the most imminent danger should induce me to
try pah the thought makes my head grow
giddy i tremble to see your highness stand
 woodstock
there balancing yourself as if you meditated a
spring into the empty air i repeat i would
scarce stand so near the verge as does your highness
for the rescue my life
ah base and degenerate spirit said the
general soul mud and clay would st thou
not do it and much more for the possession 
empire that is peradventure continued he
changing his tone as one who has said too much
shouldst thou be called on to do this that thereby
becoming a great man in the tribes israel
thou lightest redeem the captivity jerusalem
ay and it may be work some great work for
the afflicted people this land
your highness may feel such calls said the
officer but it is not for poor gilbert pearson
your faithful follower you made a jest me
yesterday when i tried to speak your language 
and i am no more able to fulfil your designs
than to use your mode speech
but pearson said cromwell thou hast
thrice yea four times called me your highness
did i my lord i was not sensible it
i crave your pardon said the officer
woodstock 
nay said oliver there was no offence i
do indeed stand high and i may perchance stand
higher though alas it were fitter for a simple
soul like me to return to my plough and my
husbandry nevertheless i will not wrestle
against the supreme will should i be called onto
do yet more in that worthy cause for surely
he who hath been to our british israel as a shield
 help and a sword excellency making her
enemies be found leers unto her will not give
over the flock to those foolish shepherds westminster
who shear the sheep and feed them not
and who are in very deed hirelings not shepherds

i trust to see your lordship quoit them all
down stairs answered pearson but may i
ask why we pursue this discourse even now until
we have secured the common enemy 
i will tarry no jot time said the general 
fence the communication love's ladder as
it is called below as i take it for almost certain
that the party whom we have driven from fastness
to fastness during the night has at length
sprung to the top yonder battlements from the
i woodstock
place where we now stand finding the turret is
guarded below the place he has chosen for his
security will prove a rattrap from whence there
is no returning
there is a cask gunpowder in this cabinet
said pearson were it not better my
lord to mine the tower if he will not render
himself and send the whole turret with its contents
one hundred feet into the air 
ah silly man said cromwell striking him
familiarly on the shoulder if thou hadst done
this without telling me it had been good service
but we will first summon the turret and then
think whether the petit will serve our turn it
is but mining at last blow a summons there
down below
the trumpets rung at his bidding till the old
walls echoed from every recess and vaulted archway
cromwell as if he cared not to look upon
the person whom he expected to appear drew back
like a necromancer afraid the spectre which he
has evoked
he has come to the battlement said pearson
to his general
woodstock 
in what dress or appearance answered
cromwell from within the chamber
a grey ridingsuit assented with silver
russet walkingboots a cut band a grey hat and
plume black hair
it is he it is he said cromwell and another
crowning mercy is vouchsafed 
meantime pearson and young lee exchanged
defiance from their respective posts
surrenders said the former or we blow
you up in your fastness
i am come too high a race to surrender to
rebels said albert assuming the air with which
in such a condition a king might have spoken
i bear you to witness cried cromwell exultingly
 he hath refused quarter a surety his
blood be on his head one you bring down the
barrel powder as he loves to soar high we
will add what can be taken from the soldiers bandelivers
 come with me pearson thou understands
this gear corporal gracebehere stand
thou fast on the platform the window where
captain pearson and i stood but even now and
bend the point thy partizan against any who
 woodstock
shall attempt to pass thou art as strong as a
bull and i will back thee against despair itself
but said the corporal mounting reluctantly
 the place is as the pinnacle the temple 
and it is written that eutychus fell down from
the third loft and was taken up dead
because he slept upon his post answered
cromwell readily beware thou carelessness
and thus thy feet shall be kept from stumbling 
you four soldiers remain here to support the
corporal if it be necessary and you as well as
the corporal will draw into the vaulted passage
the minute the trumpets sound a retreat it is as
strong as a casemate and you may lie there safe
from the effects the mine thou zerobabel
robins i know wilt be their lance private
robins bowed and the general departed to join
those who were without
as he reached the door the hall the petard
was heard to explode and he saw that it had succeeded
 for the soldiers rushed brandishing their
swords and pistols in at the postern the turret
whose gate had been successfully forced a thrill
woodstock 
 exultation but not unmingled with horror shot
across the veins the ambitious soldier
now now he cried they are dealing
with him 
his expectations were deceived pearson and
the others returned disappointed and reported
they had been stopt by a strong trap door grated
iron extended over the narrow stair and they
could see there was an obstacle the same kind
some ten feet higher to remove it by force
while a desperate and wellarmed man had the advantage
 the steps above them might cost many
lives which lackaday said the general
it is our duty to be tender what dost thou
advise gilbert pearson 
we must use powder my lord answered
pearson who saw his master was determined he
should have the whole merit the proceeding 
there may be a chamber easily and conveniently
formed under the foot the stair we have
a sausage by good luck to form the train and
so 
ah said cromwell i know thou canst
manage such gear well but gilbert i go to
b woodstock
visit the posts and give them orders to retire to
a safe distance when the retreat is sounded you
will allow them five minutes for this purpose
three is enough for any knave them all
said pearson they will be lame indeed that
require more on such a service i ask but one
though i fire the train myself
take heed said cromwell that the poor
soul be listened to if he asks quarter it may be
he may repent him his hardheartiness and
cal for mercy
and mercy he shall have answered pearson
 providing he calls loud enough to make me
hear him for the explosion that damned petard
has made me as deaf as the devils dam
hush gilbert hush said cromwell you
offend in your language
zooks sir i must speak either in your way
or in my own said pearson unless i am to be
dumb as well as deaf away with you my lord
to visit the posts and you will presently hear
me make some noise in the world
cromwell smiled gently at his aiddecamp's
petulance patted him on the shoulder and called
him a mad fellow walked a little way then turned
back to whisper what thou doest do quickly
then returned again towards the outer circle 
guards turning his head from time to time as if
to assure himself that the corporal to whom he
had intrusted the duty still kept guard with his
advanced weapon upon the terrific chasm between
rosamond's tower and the corresponding turret
seeing him standing on his post the general
muttered between his mustachios the fellow
hath the strength and courage a bear and yonder
is a post where one shall do more to keep back
than an hundred in making way he cast a last
look on the gigantic figure who stood in that airy
position like some gothic statue the weapon half
levelled against the opposite turret with the but
rested against his right foot his steel cap and
burnished corslet glittering in the rising sun
cromwell then passed on to give the necessary
orders that such sentinels as might be endangered
at their present posts by the effect the mine
should withdraw at the sound the trumpet to the
places which he pointed out to them never on
any occasion his life did he display more calmness
and presence mind he was kind nay
tk woodstock
facetious with the soldiers who adored him and
yet he resembled a volcano before the eruption
commences all peaceful and quiet without while
an hundred contradictory passions were raging in
his bosom
corporal humgudgeon meanwhile remained
steady upon his post yet though as determined
a soldier as ever fought among the redoubled regiment
 ironsides and possessed no small
share that exalted fanaticism which lent so keen
an edge to the natural courage those stern religionists
the veteran felt his present situation to
be highly uncomfortable within a pike's length
 him arose a turret which was about to be dispersed
in massive fragments through the air and
he felt small confidence in the length time
which might be allowed for his escape from such
a dangerous vicinity the duty constant vigilance
upon his post was partly divided by this
natural feeling which induced him from time to
time to bend his eyes on the miners below instead
 keeping them rivetted on the opposite turret
at length the interest the scene arose to the
uttermost after entering and returning from the
turret and coming out again more than once in
woodstock 
the course about twenty minutes pearson issued
as it might be supposed for the last time
carrying in his hand and uncoiling as he went
along the sausage or linen bag so called from
its appearance which strongly sewed together
and crammed with gunpowder was to serve asa
train betwixt the mine to be sprung and the
point occupied by the engineer who was to give
fire he was in the act finally adjusting it
when the attention the corporal on the tower
became irresistibly and exclusively rivetted upon
the preparations for the explosion but while he
watched the aiddecamp drawing his pistol to
give fire and the trumpeter handling his instrument
as waiting the order to sound the retreat
fate rushed on the unhappy sentinel in a way he
least expected
young active bold and completely possessed
 his presence mind albert lee who had
been from the loopholes a watchful observer 
every measure which had been taken by his besiegers
had resolved to make one desperate effort
for selfpreservation while the head the sentinel
on the opposite platform was turned from
 woodstock
him and bent rather downwards he suddenly
sprung across the chasm though the space on
which he lighted was scarce wide enough for two
persons threw the surprised soldier from his precarious
stand and jumped himself down into the
chamber the gigantic trooper went sheer down
twenty feet struck against a projecting battlement
which launched the wretched man outwards and
then fell on the earth with such tremendous force
that the head which first touched the ground
tinted a hole in the soil six inches in depth
and was crushed like an eggshell scarce knowing
what had happened yet startled and confounded
at the descent this heavy body which
fell at no great distance from him pearson snapt
his pistol at the train no previous warning given 
the powder caught and the mine exploded had
it been strongly charged with powder many 
those without might have suffered but the explosion
was only powerful enough to blow out ina
lateral direction a part the wall just above
the foundation sufficient however to destroy the
equipoise the building then amid a cloud
 smoke which began gradually to encircle the
woodstock 
turret like a shrewd arising slowly from its base
to its summit it was seen to stagger and shake
by all who had courage to look steadily at a sight
so dreadful slowly at first the building inclined
outwards then rushed precipitately to its
base and fell to the ground in huge fragments
the strength its resistance showing the excellence
 the masonwork the engineer so soon
as he had fired the train fled in such alarm that
he well nigh ran against his general who was
advancing towards him while a huge stone from
the summit the building flying farther than
the rest lighted within a yard them
thou hast been overhasty pearson said
cromwell with the greatest composure possible
 hath no one fallen in that same tower 
sloe
some one fell said pearson still in great
agitation and yonder lies his body halfburied
in the rubbish
with a quick and resolute step cromwell approached
the spot and exclaimed pearson
thou hast ruined methe young man hath escaped
 this is our own sentinel plague on the
 woodstock
idiot let him rot beneath the ruins which crushed
him 
a cry now resounded from the platform rosamond's
tower which appeared yet taller than
formerly deprived the neighbouring turret
which emulated though it did not attain to its
height a prisoner noble general a prisoner
the fox whom we have chased au night is now
in the snare the lord hath delivered him into
the hand his servants
look you keep him in safe custody exclaimed
cromwell and bring him presently
down to the apartment from which the secret passages
have their principal entrance
 your excellency shall be obeyed 
the proceedings albert lee to which these
exclamations related had been unfortunate he
had dashed from the platform as we have related
the gigantic strength the soldier opposed
to him and had instantly jumped down into
rochecliffe's chamber but the soldiers stationed
there threw themselves upon him and after a
struggle which was hopelessly maintained against
such advantage numbers had thrown the young
woodstock 
cavalier to the ground two them drawn down
by his strenuous exertions falling across him at
the same moment a sharp and severe report was
heard winch like a clap thunder in the immediate
vicinity shook all around them till the
strong and solid tower tottered like the mast a
stately vessel when about to part by the board
in a few seconds this was followed by another sullen
sound at first low and deep but augmenting
like the roar a cataract as it descends reeling
bellowing and rushing as if to astound boil
heaven and earth so awful indeed was the
sound the neighbour tower as it fell that both
the captive and those who struggled with him
continued for a minute or two passive in each
other's grasp
albert was the first who recovered consciousness
and activity he shook off those who lay
above him and made a desperate effort to gain
his feet in which he partly succeeded but as he
had to deal with men accustomed to every species
 danger and whose energies were recovered
nearly as soon as his own he was completely 
 ir
 woodstock
cured and his arms held down loyal and faithful
to his trust and resolved to sustain to the last
the character which he had assumed he exclaimed
as his struggles were finally overpowered rebel
villains would you slay your king 
ha heard you that cried one the soldiers
to the lanceprivate who commanded the
party shall i not strike this son a wicked
father under the fifth rib even as the tyrant 
moab was smitten by thud with a dagger a
cubit's length 
but robins answered be it far from us merciful
strickalthrow to slay in cold blood the captive
 our bow and our spear methinks since
the storm tredagh f we have shed enough 
blood therefore on your lives do him no evil 
but take from him his arms and let us bring him
before the chosen instrument even our general
that he may do with him what is meet in his
eyes
 lanceprivate or lancebrigade a private appointed
to a small command a sort temporary corporal
i tredagh or drogheda was taken by cromwell in by
storm and the governor and whole garrison put to the sword
woodstock 
by this time the soldier whose exultation had
made him the first to communicate the intelligence
from the battlements to cromwell returned
and brought commands corresponding to the orders
 their temporary officer and albert lee
disarmed and bound was conducted as a captive
into the apartment which derived its name from
the victories his ancestor and placed in the presence
 general cromwell
running over in his mind the time which had
elapsed since the departure charles till the
siege if it may be termed so had terminated in
his own capture albert had every reason to hope
that his royal master must have had time to accomplish
his escape yet he determined to maintain
to the last a deceit which might for a time
insure the king's safety the difference betwixt
them could not he thought be instantly discovered
begrimed as he was with dust and smoke
and with blood issuing from some scratches received
in the scuffle
in this evil plight but bearing himself with
such dignity as was adapted to the princely chaos
woodstock
racer albert was ushered into the apartment 
victor lee where in his father's own chair reclined
the triumphant enemy the cause to which

oliver cromwell arose from his seat as the
two veteran soldiers zerobabel robins and merciful
strickalthrow introduced into the apartment
the prisoner whom they held by the arms and
fixed his stern hazel eye on albert long before he
could give vent to the ideas which were swelling
in his bosom exultation was the most predominant

art not thou he at length said that egyptian
which before these days modest an uproar
and eldest out into the wilderness many thousand
men who were murderers ha youth i
 woodstock
have hunted thee from stirling to worcester and
we are met at last 
i would replied albert speaking in the character
which he had assumed that we had met
where i could have shown thee the difference betwixt
a rightful king and an ambitious usurper 
go to young man said cromwell say
rather the difference between a judge raised up
for the redemption england and the son 
those kings whom the lord in his anger permitted
to reign over her but we will not waste useless
words god knows that it is not our will
that we are called to such high matters being as
humble in our thoughts as we are ourselves 
and in our unassisted nature frail and foolish and
unable to render a reason but for the better spirit
within us which is not us thou art weary
young man and thy nature requires rest and refection
being doubtless dealt with delicately as
one who hath fed on the fat and drunk the
sweet and who hath been clothed in purple and
fine linen
here the general suddenly stopt and then
abruptly exclaimed but is this ah whom
woodstock till
have we here these are not the locks the swarthy
lad charles stuart a cheat a cheat 
albert hastily cast his eyes on a mirror which
stood in the room and perceived that a dark peruke
found among doctor rochecliffe's miscellaneous
wardrobe had been disordered in the
scuffle and that his own lightbrown hair was
escaping from beneath it
 who is this said cromwell again stamping
with fury pluck the disguise from him
the soldiers did so and bringing him at the
same time towards the light the deception could
not be maintained for a moment longer with any
possibility success cromwell came up to him
with his teeth set and grinding against each other
as he spoke his hands clenched and trembling
with emotion and speaking with a voice lowpitched
bitterly and deeply emphatic such as
might have preceded a stab with his dagger
thy name young man 
he was answered calmly and firmly while the
countenance the speaker wore a cast triumph
and even contempt
o woodstock
albert lee ditches a faithful subject 
king charles
i might have guessed it said cromwell 
ay and to king charles shalt thou go as soon
as it is noon on the dial pearson he continued
 let him be carried to the others and let
them be executed at twelve exactly
all sir said pearson surprised for cromwell
though he at times made formidable examples
was in general by no means sanguinary
all repeated cromwell fixing his eye on
yoimg lee yes young sir your conduct has
devoted to death thy father thy kinsman and the
stranger that was in thine household such wreck
hast thou brought on thy father's house
my father too my aged father said albert
looking upward and endeavouring to raise
his hands in the same direction which was prevented
by his bonds the lord's will be done 
all this havoc can be saved if said the general
 thou wilt answer one question where
is the young charles stuart who was called king
 scotland 
woods uk jis
under heavens protection and safe from
thy power was the firm and unhesitating answer
 the young royalist
 away with him to prisons said cromwell 
and from thence to execution with the rest 
them as malignant taken in the fact let a
court martial sit on them presently
one word said young lee as they led him
from the room
stop stop said cromwell with the agitation
 renewed hope let him be heard
you love texts scripture said albert
let this be the subject your next homily
had zimri peace who slew his master 
away with him said the general let
him die the death i have said it
as cromwell spoke these words his aiddecamp
observed that he became unwontedly pale
your excellency is overtoiled in the public
service said pearson a course the stag in
the evening will refresh you the old knight hath
a noble hound here if we can but get him to hunt
without his master which may be hard as he is
faithful and 
 woodstock
hang him up said cromwell
what whom hang the noble dog your
excellency was wont to love a good hound 
it matters not said cromwell let him be
killed is it not written that they slew in the valley
 anchor not only the accursed achan with
his sons and his daughters but also his oxen and
his asses and his sheep and every live thing belonging
unto him and even thus shall we do to
the malignant family lee who have aided
sisera in his flight when israel might have been
delivered his trouble for ever but send out
couriers and patrols follow pursue watch in
every direction let my horse be ready at the
door in five minutes or bring me the first thou
canst find
 it seemed to pearson that this was something
wildly spoken and that the cold perspiration was
standing upon the general's brow as he said it
he therefore again pressed the necessity repose
and it would appear that nature seconded strongly
the representation cromwell arose and made a
step or two towards the door the apartment 
but stopped staggered and after a pause sate
woodstock 
down in a chair truly friend pearson he
said this weary carcase ours is an impediment
to us even in our most necessary business
and i am fitter to sleep than to watch which is not
my wont place guards therefore tiu we repose
ourselves for an hour or two send out in every
direction and spare not for horses flesh wake
me if the court martial should require instruction
and forget not to see the sentence punctually executed
on the lees and those who were arrested
with them
as cromwell spoke thus he arose and halfopened
a bed room door when pearson again craved
pardon for asking if he had rightly understood
his excellency that all the prisoners were
to be executed
have i not said it answered cromwell
displeasedly is it because thou art a man 
blood and hast ever been that thou dost affect
these scruples to show thyself tenderhearted at
my expense i tell thee that if there lack one in
the full tale execution thine own life shall pay
the forfeit
so saying he entered the apartment followed
uj woodstock
by the groom his chamber who attended upon
pearson's summons
when his general had retired pearson remained
in great perplexity what he ought to do and
that from no scruples conscience but from uncertainty
whether he might not err either in postponing
or in too hastily and too literally executing
the instructions he had received
in the meantime strickalthrow and robins had
returned after lodging albert in prison to the
room where pearson was still musing on his generals
commands both these men were agitators
in their army and old soldiers whom cromwell
was accustomed to treat with great familiarity
 so that robins had no hesitation to ask captain
pearson whether he meant to execute the
commands the general even to the letter
pearson shook his head with an air doubt
but added there was no choice left
be assured said the old man that if thou
doest this folly thou wilt cause israel to sin and
that the general will not be pleased with your service
thou knowest and none better than thou
that oliver although he be like unto david the son
woodstock
 jesse in faith and wisdom and courage yet
there are times when the evil spirit cometh upon
him as it did upon saul and he uttered commands
which he will not thank any one for executing
pearson was too good a politician to assent directly
to a proposition which he could not deny 
he only shook his head once more and said that it
was easy for those to talk who were not responsible
but the soldier's duty was to obey his orders and
not to judge them
very righteous truth said merciful strickthrow
a grim old scotchman i marvel where
our brother zerobabel caught up this softness 
heart r
why i do but wish said zerobabel that
four or five human creatures nay draw the breath
 god's air for a few hours more there can be
small harm done by delaying the execution and
the general will have some time for reflection
ay said captain pearson but i in my service
must be more pointedly obsequious than thou
in thy plainness art bound to be friend zeroba
bel
o
 woodstock
 then shall the coarse friezecassock the
private soldier bear out the blast with the gilded
lining the captain said zerobabel ay indeed
i can show you warrant why we be artful to
each other in doing acts kindness 
seeing the best us are poor sinful crease
turns who might suffer being called to a brief accounting

 a verity you surprise me brother zeroba
bel said strickalthrow that thou being an old
and experienced soldier whose head hath grown
grey in battle should'st give such advice to a
young officer is not the general's commission to
take away the wicked from the land and to root
out the amalekite and the jebusite and the peruse
and the hittite and the graphite and
the morte and are not these men justly to be
compared to the five kings who took shelter in
the cave maketh who were delivered into the
hands joshua the son nun and he caused
his captains and his soldiers to come near and
tread on their necks and then he smote them
and he slew them and then he hanged them ony

woodstock 
five trees even till evening and thou gilbert
pearson by name be not withheld from the duty
which is appointed to thee but do even as has
been commanded by him who is raised up to
judge and to deliver israel for it is written cursed
is he who holdeth back his sword from the
slaughter 
thus wrangled the two military theologians
while pearson much more solicitous to anticipate
the wishes over than to know the will heaven
listened to them with great indecision and
perplexity

the reader will recollect that when rochecliffs
and joceline were made prisoners the party
which escorted them had two other captives in their
train colonel everard namely and the rev nehemiah
holdenough when they had obtained
entrance into woodstock and commenced their
search after the fugitive prince the prisoners were
placed in what had been an old guardroom and
which was by its strength well calculated to serve
for a prison and a guard was placed over them by
pearson no light was allowed save that a
woodstock 
glimmering fire charcoal the prisoners remained
separated from each other colonel everard conversing
with nehemiah holdenough at a distance
from doctor rochecliffe sir henry lee and jofeline
the party was soon after augmented by
wildrake who was brought down to the lodge
and thrust in with so little ceremony that his
arms being bound he had very nearly fallen on
his nose in the middle the prison
i thank you my good friend he said looking
back to the door which they who had pushed
him in were securing point de ceremonie no

yes replied the doctor and you know i

i prithee be quiet master wildrake said
sir henry
nay good knight answered wildrake be
somewhat more cordial with a comrade in distress
this is a different scene from the brentford storming
party the jade fortune has been a very
stepmother to me i will sing you a song i made
on my own ill luck
at this moment captain wildrake we are
not in a fitting mood for singing said sir henry
civilly and gravely
nay it will aid your devotions egad it
sounds like a penitential psalm
when was a young lad
my fortune was bad
if e'er i do well tis a wonder
i spent all my means

the door opened as wildrake finished this
stanza at the top his voice and in rushed a
sentinel who greeting him by the title blasphemous
bellowing bull bashan bestowed a
severe blow with his ramrod on the shoulders 
the songster whose bonds permitted him no means
 returning the compliment
your humble servant again sir said wildrake
shrugging his shoulders sorry i have no
means showing my gratitude i am bound
over to keep the peace like captain boabdil 
ha knight did you hear my bones clatter that
blow came twanging off the fellow might inflict

pshaw this is not the tunc it goes to here he
fell fast asleep and sooner or later all his companions
in misfortune followed his example
the benches intended for the repose the soldiers
 the guard afforded the prisoners convenience
enough to lie down though their slumbers
it may be believed were neither sound nor undisturbed
but when daylight was but a little while
broken the explosion gunpowder which took
place and the subsequent fall the turret to
which the mine was applied would have awakened
the seven sleepers or morpheus himself the
smoke penetrating through the windows left them
at no loss for the cause the din
there went my gunpowder said rochecliffe
which has i trust blown up as many rebel
villains as it might have been the means destroying
otherwise in a fair field it must have
caught fire by chance
by chance no said sir henry depend on
it my bold albert has fired the train and that in
yonder blast cromwell was flying towards the heaven
whoso battlements he will never reach ah
 woodstock
my brave boy and perhaps thou art thyself sacrificed
like a youthful sampson among the rebellious
philistines but i wil not be long behind
thee alberti
everard hastened to the door hoping to obtain
from the guard to whom his name and rank might
be known some explanation the noise which
seemed to announce some dreadful catastrophe
but nehemiah holdenough whose rest had
been broken by the trumpet which gave signal for
the explosion appeared in the very acme horror
 it is the trumpet the archangel he
cried it is the crushing this world elements
 it is the summons to the judgmentseat 
the dead are obeying the call they are with us
they are amongst us they arise in their bodily
frames they come to summon us 
as he spoke his eyes were rivetted upon dr
rochecliffe who stood directly opposite to him
in rising hastily the cap which he commonly
wore according to a custom then usual both among
clergymen and townsmen a civil profession had
escaped from his head and carried with it the
large silk patch which he probably wore for the
woodstock 

purpose disguise for the cheek which was disclosed
was unscarred and the eye as good as that
which was usually covered
colonel everard returning from the door endeavoured
in vain to make master holdenough
comprehend what he learned from the guard without
that the explosion had only involved the death
 one cromwell soldiers the presbyterian
divine continued to stare wildly at him the
episcopal persuasion
but dr rochecliffe heard and understood the
news brought by colonel everard and relieved
from the instant anxiety which had kept him stationary
he advanced towards the retiring calvinist
extending his hand in the most friendly
manner
avoid thee avoid thee said holdenough
 the living may not join hands with the
dead
 but i said rochecliffe am as much alive
as you are
thou alive thou joseph albany whom
my own eyes saw precipitated from the battlements

see me swim ashore on a marsh covered with

i will explain to you another time

uncertainty thou art indeed warm and alive
he said and yet after so many blows and a fall
so tremendous thou canst not be my joseph

doctor become so in virtue my mother's little
estate which fines and confiscations have made an
 
and is it so indeed said holdenough
and have i recovered mine old chum 
even so replied rochecliffe by the same
token i appeared to you in the mirror chamber
thou wert so bold nehemiah that our whole
scheme would have been shipwrecked had i not
appeared to thee in the shape a departed friend
yet believe me it went against my heart to do it
ah fie on thee fie on thee said holdenough
throwing himself into his arms and clasping
him to his bosom thou wert ever a naughty

wag how couwst thou play me such a trick t 
ah albany doest thou remember dr purely

his arm through the presbyterian divine's and
guiding him to a seat apart from the other prisoners
who witnessed this scene with much surprise
remember caius college said rochecliffe
ay and the good ale we drank and our parties

oh name not that iniquity said nehemiah
since i may well say as the pious master baxter
that these boyish offences have had their punishment
in later years inasmuch as that inordinate
appetite for fruit hath produced stomachic affections

 true true clear nehemiah said rochecliffe
but care not for them a dram brandy will
correct it all mr baxter was he was about to
say an ass but checked himself and only filled
up the sentence with a good man i dare say
but over scrupulous
so they sat down together the best friends
and for half an hour talked with mutual delight
over old college stories by degrees they got on
the politics the day and though then they
unclasped their hands and there occurred between
them such expressions as nay my dear
brother and there i must needs differ and
on this point i crave leave to think yet a hue
and cry against the independents and other sectaries
being started they followed like brethren
in full hollo and it was hard to guess which wag
most forward unhappily in the course this
amiable intercourse something was mentioned
about the bishopric titus which at once involved
them in the doctrinal question church
government then alas the floodgates were
opened and they showered on each other greek
and hebrew texts while their eyes kindled their
woodstock 
cheeks glowed their hands became clenched and
they looked more like fierce polemics about to rend
each other's eyes out than christian divines
roger wildrake by making himself an auditor
 the debate contrived to augment its violence
he took course a most decided part in a question
the merits which were totally unknown to
him somewhat overawed by holdenough's ready
oratory and learning the cavalier watched with a
face anxiety the countenance dr rochecliffe 
but when he saw the proud eye and steady bearing
 the episcopal champion and heard him
answer greek with greek and hebrew with hebrew
he backed his arguments as he closed them
with a stout rap upon the bench and an exulting
laugh in the face the antagonist it was with
some difficulty that sir henry and colonel everard
having at length and reluctantly interfered
prevailed on the two alienated friends to adjourn
their dispute removing at the same time to a distance
and regarding each other with looks in
which old friendship appeared to have totally
given way to mutual animosity
but while they sate lowering on each other
j woodstock
and longing to renew a contest in which each
claimed the victory pearson entered the prison
and in a low and troubled voice desired the persons
whom it contained to prepare for instant
death
sir henry lee received the doom with the
stern composure which he had hitherto displayed
colonel everard attempted the interposition
 a strong and resentful appeal to the
parliament against the judgment the court
martial and the general but pearson declined
to receive or transmit any such remonstrance and
with a dejected look and mien melancholy presage
renewed his exhortation to them to prepare
for the hour noon and withdrew from the
prison
the operation this intelligence on the two
clerical disputants was more remarkable they
gazed for a moment on each other with eyes in
which repentant kindness and a feeling generous
shame quenched every lingering feeling resentment
and joining in the mutual exclamation 
my brother my brother i have sinned i have
sinned in offending thee they rushed into each

other's arms shed tears as they demanded each
other's forgiveness nd ike two warriors who
sacrifice a personal quarrel to discharge their
duty against the common enemy they recalled

most gracious prince good canning cried
leave vengeance to our god
and lay the iron rule aside
be thine the olive rod
ballad sir charles baxedin
the hour appointed for execution had been
long past and it was about five in the evening
when the protector summoned pearson to his presence
he went with fear and reluctance uncertain
how he might be received after remaining about
a quarter an hour the aiddecamp returned
to victor lee's parlour where he found the old
soldier zerobabel robins in attendance for his
return
how is oliver said the old man anxiously
why well answered pearson and hath
woodstock 
asked no questions the execution but many concerning
the reports we have been able to make regarding
the flight the young man and is much
moved at thinking he must now be beyond pursuit
also i gave him certain papers belonging to the
malignant doctor rochecuffe
then will i venture upon him said the adcurator
 so give me a napkin that i may look
like a sewer and fetch up the food which i directed
should be in readiness
two troopers attended accordingly with a ration
 beef such as was distributed to the private
soldiers and dressed after their fashion a pewter
pot ale a trencher with salt black pepper and
a loaf ammunition bread come with me he
said to pearson and fear not nol loves an
innocent jest he boldly entered the general's
sleeping apartment and said aloud arise thou
that art called to be a judge in israel let there
be no more folding the hands to sleep lo i
come as a sign to thee wherefore arise eat drink
and let thy heart be glad within thee for thou
shalt eat with joy the food him that laboured
in the trenches seeing that since thou wert comsc
woodstock
mander over the host the poor sentinel hath had
such provisions as i have now placed for thine
own refreshment
truly brother zerobabel said cromwell
accustomed to such starts enthusiasm among
his followers we would wish that it were so 
neither is it our desire to sleep soft nor feed more
highly than the meanest that ranks under our banners
verily thou hast chosen well for my refreshment
and the smell the food is savoury in my
nostrils
he arose from the bed on which he had lain
down half dressed and wrapping his cloak around
him sate down by the bedside and partook
heartily the plain food which was prepared for
him while he was eating cromwell commanded
pearson to finish his report you need not
desist for the presence a worthy soldier whose
spirit is as my spirit
nay but interrupted loins you are to
know that gilbert pearson hath not fully executed
thy commands touching a part those malignant
all whom should have died at noon
woodstock 
what execution what malignant said
cromwell laying down his knife and fork
those in the prison here at woodstock
answered zerobabel whom your excellency
commanded should be executed at noon as taken
in the fact rebellion against the commonwealth
wretch said cromwell starting up and
addressing pearson thou hast not touched
mark everard in whom there was no guilt for
he was deceived by him who passed between us 
neither hast thou put forth thy hand on the pragmatic
presbyterian minister to have all those 
the classes cry sacrilege and alienate them from
us for ever 
if your excellency wish them to live they
live their life and death are in the power a
word said pearson
enfranchise them i must gain the presbyterian
interest over to us if i can
rochecliffe the archplotters said pearson
i thought to have executed but 
barbarous man said cromwell alike ungrateful
and impolitic wouldst thou have destroyed
our decoyduck this doctor is but like
vol iii vr
 woodstock
a well a shallow one indeed but something deeper
than the springs which discharge their secret tribute
into his keeping then come i with a pump
and suck it all up to the open air enlarge him
and let him have money if he wants it i know his
haunts he can go nowhere but our eye will be
upon him but you look at each other darkly as
if you had more to say than you durst i trust
you have not done to death sir henry lee 
no yet the man replied pearson is a
confirmed malignant and 
 ay but he is also a noble relic the ancient
english gentleman said the general i
would i knew how to win the favour that race
but we pearson whose royal robes are the armour
which we wear on our bodies and whose leadingstaves
are our sceptres are too newly set up to
draw the respect the proud malignant who
cannot brook to submit to less than royal lineage
yet what can they see in the longest kingly line
in europe save that it runs back to a successful
soldier i grudge that one man should be honoured
and followed because he is the descendant
 a victorious commander while less honour
woodstock 
and allegiance is paid to another who in personal
qualities and in success might emulate the founder
 his rivers dynasty well sir henry lee lives
and shall live for me his son indeed hath deserved
the death which he has doubtless sustained
my lord stammered pearson since your
excellency has found i am right in suspending
your order in so many instances i trust you will
not blame me in this also i thought it best to
await more special orders
thou art in a mighty merciful humour this
morning pearson said cromwell not entirely
satisfied
if your excellency please the halter is ready
and so is the provost marshal
nay if such a bloody fellow as thou hast
spared him it would ill become me to destroy
him said the general but then here is
among ilochecliftes papers the engagement 
twenty desperadoes to take us off some example
ought to be made
my lord said zerobabel consider now
how often this young man albert lee hath been
near you nay probably quite close to your 
woodstock
excellency in these darkpassages which he knew
and we did not had he been an assassin's
nature it would have cost him but a pistolshot
and the light israel was extinguished nay
in the unavoidable confusion which must have
ensued the sentinels quitting their posts he might
have had a fair chance escape
enough zerobabel he lives said the general
 he shall remain in custody for sometime
however and be then banished from england
the other two are safe course for you
would not dream considering such paltry fellows
as fit victims for my revenge
one fellow the underkeeper called joliffe
deserves death however said pearson since
he has frailty admitted that he slew honest joseph
tomkins
he deserves a reward for saving us a labour
said cromwell that tomkins was a most doublehearted
villain i have found evidence among
these papers here that if we had lost the fight at
worcester we should have had reason to regret
that we had ever trusted master tomkins it was
only our success which anticipated his treachery
i
woodstock 
write us down debtor not creditor to joceline
an you call him so and to his quarterstaffs
there remains the sacrilegious and graceless
cavalier who attempted your excellency's life
last night said pearson
nay said the general that were stooping
too low for revenge his sword had no more
power than had he thrusted with a tobaccopipe
eagles stoop not at mallards or wilddrakes
either
yet sir said pearson the fellow should
be punished as a libeller the quantity foul
and pestilential abuse which we found in his pockets
makes me loath he should go altogether free
please to look at them sir
a most vile hand said oliver as he looked
at a sheet or two our friend wildrake's poetical
miscellanies the very hand writing seems
to be drunk and the poetry not very sober what
have we here 
when i was a young lad
my fortune was bad 
if e'er i do well tis a wonder 
why what trash is this and then again 
 woodstock
now a plague on the poll
 old politic noll
we will drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
in truth if it could be done that way this poet
would be a stout champion give the poor knave
five pieces pearson and bid him go sell his ballads
if he come within twenty miles our person
though we will have him flogged till the blood
runs down to his heels
there remains only one sentenced person
said pearson a noble wolfhound finer than any
your excellency saw in ireland he belongs to
the old knight sir henry lee should your excellency
not desire to keep the fine creature yourself
might i presume to beg that i might have
leave 
 no pearson said cromwell the old man
so faithful himself shall not be deprived his
faithful dog i would had any creature were
it but a dog that followed me because it loved
me not for what it could make me
your excellency is unjust to your faithful
soldiers said zerobabel bluntly who follow
woodstock s
you like dogs fight for you like dogs and have
the grave a dog on the spot where they happen
to fall
 how now old grumbler said the general
what means this change note 
corporal curmudgeon's remains are left to
moulder under the ruins yonder tower and
tomkins is thrust into a hole in a thicket like a
beast
true true said cromwell they shall be
removed to the churchyard and every soldier
shall attend with cockades seagreen and blue
ribbon every one the noncommissioned officers
and the agitators shall have a mourningscarf
we ourselves will lead the procession and
there shall be a proper dole wine burnt brandy
and rosemary see that it is done pearson after
the funeral woodstock shall be dismantled and
destroyed that its recesses may not again afford
shelter to rebels and malignant
the commands the general were punctually
obeyed and when the other prisoners were dismissed
albert lee remained for some time in
custody he went abroad after his liberation 
woodstock
tered in king charles's guards where he was promoted
by that monarch but his fate as we shall
see hereafter only allowed him a short though
bright career
we return to the liberation the other prisoners
from woodstock the two divines completely reconciled
to each other retreated arm in arm to the
parsonage house formerly the residence dr
rochecliffe but which he now visited as the guest
 his successor nehemiah holdenough the
presbyterian had no sooner installed his friend
under his roof than he urged upon him an offer to
partake it and the income annexed to it as his own
dr rochecliffe was much affected but wisely rejected
the generous offer considering the difference
 their tenets on church government which each
entertained as religiously as his creed another
debate though a light one on the subject the
office bishops in the primitive church confirmed
him in his resolution they parted the
next day and their friendship remained undisturbed
by controversy till mr holdenough's death
in a harmony which might be in some
degree owing to their never meeting again after
woodstock 
their imprisonment doctor rocheeliffe was restored
to his living after the restoration and ascended
from thence to high clerical preferment
the inferior personages the grand gaoldelivery
at woodstock lodge easily found themselves
temporary accommodations in the town among old
acquaintance but no one ventured to entertain the
old knight understood to be so much under the
displeasure the ruling powers and even the innkeeper
 the george who had been one his
tenants scarce dared to admit him to the common
privileges a traveller who has food and lodging
for his money everard attended him unrequested
unpermitted but also unforbidden the heart
 the old man had been turned once more towards
him when he learned how he had behaved
at the memorable rencontre at the king's oak
and saw that he was an object the enmity rather
than the favour cromwell but there was
another secret feeling which tended to reconcile
him to his nephew the consciousness that everard
shared with him the deep anxiety which he experienced
on account his daughter who was not
yet returned from her doubtful and perilous expel
woodstotft
lotion he felt that he himself would perhaps
be unable to discover where alice had taken refuge
during the late events or to obtain her
deliverance if she was taken into custody he
wished everard to offer him his service in making
a search for her but shame prevented his preferring
the request and everard who could not suspect
the altered state his uncle's mind was afraid to
make the proposal assistance or even to name
the name alice
the sun had already set they sate looking each
other in the face in silence when the trampling
 horses was heard there was knocking at the
door there was a light step on the stair and
alice the subject their anxiety stood before
them she threw herself joyfully into her father's
arms who glanced his eye heedfully round the
room as he said in a whisper is all safe 
safe and out danger as i trust replied
alice i have a token for you
her eye then rested on everard she blushed
was embarrassed and silent
you need not fear your presbyterian cousin
said the knight with a goodhumoured smile he
woodstock 
has himself proved a confessor at least for loyalty
and ran the risk being a martyr
she pulled from her bosom the royal rescript
written on a small and soiled piece paper and
tied round with a worsted thread instead a sealsuch
as it was sir henry ere he opened it pressed
the little packet with oriental veneration to iris
lips to his heart to his forehead and it was not
before a tear had dropt on it that he found courage
to open and read the billet it was in these
words 
loyal oui much esteemed friend our
trusty subject
it having become known to us that a purpose
 marriage has been entertained betwixt mrs alice
lee your only daughter and markham everard
esq severely chase her kinsman and by
affiance your nephew and being assured that
this match would be highly agreeable to you
had it not been for certain respects to our service
which induced you to refuse your consent
thereto we do therefore acquaint you that far
from our aflfiirs suffering by such an alliance we
 woodstock
do exhort and so far as we may require you to
consent to the same as you would wish to do us
good pleasure and greatly to advance our affairs
leaving to you nevertheless as becometh a christian
king the full exercise your own discretion
concerning other obstacles to such an alliance
which may exist independent those connected
with our service witness our hand together with
our thankful recollections your good services to
our late royal father as well as ourselves
c r
long and steadily did sir henry gaze on the
letter so that it might almost seem as if he were
getting it by heart he then placed it carefully
in his pocketbook and asked alice the account
 her adventures the preceding night they
were briefly told their midnight walk through
the chase had been speedily and safely accomplished
when she had seen charles and his
attendant set off she had taken some repose in
the cottage where they parted with the morning
came news that woodstock was occupied by
soldiers so that return thither might have led to
woodstock 
danger suspicion and inquiry alice therefore
did not attempt it but went to a house in the
neighbourhood inhabited by a lady established
loyalty whose husband had been major sir
henry lee's regiment and had fallen at the battle
 naseby mrs aylmer was a sensible woman
and indeed the necessities the singular times
had sharpened every one's faculties for stratagem
and intrigue she sent a faithful servant to scout
about the mansion at woodstock who no sooner
saw the prisoners dismissed and in safety and ascertained
the knight's destination for the evening
than he carried the news to his mistress and by
her orders attended alice on horseback to join
her father 
there was seldom perhaps an evening meal
made in such absolute silence as by this embarrassed
party each occupied with their own thoughts
and at a loss how to fathom those the others
at length the hour came when alice felt herself at
liberty to retire to repose after a day so fatiguing
everard handed her to the door her apartment
and was then himself about to take leave when
to his surprise his uncle asked him to return
 woodstock
pointed to a chair and giving him the king's
letter to read fixed his looks on him steadily during
the perusal determined that if he could discover
aught short the utmost delight in the
reading the commands the king himself should
be disobeyed rather than alice should be sacrificed
to one who received not her hand as the
greatest blessing earth had to bestow but the
features everard indicated joyful hope even
beyond what the father could have anticipated yet
mingled with surprise and when he raised his eye
to the knight's with timidity and doubt a smile was
on sir henry's countenance as he broke silence
the king he said had he no other subject
in england should dispose at will those the
house lee but methinks the family everard
have not been so devoted late to the crown as
to comply with a mandate inviting its heir to
marry the daughter a beggar
the daughter sir henry lee said everard
kneeling to his uncle and perforce kissing his
hand would grace the house a duke
the girl is well enough said the knight
proudly for myself my poverty shall neither
woodstock 
shame nor encroach on my friends some few
pieces i have by dr rochcliff'e's kindness and
joceline and i will strike out something
nay my dear uncle you are richer than you
think for said everard that part your
estate which my father redeemed for payment 
a moderate composition is still your own and
held by trustees in your name myself being one
 them you are only our debtor for an advance
 moneys for which if it will content you we will
count with you like usurers my father is incapable
 profiting by making a bargain on his own
account for the estate a distressed friend and
all this you would have learned long since but
that you would not i mean time did not serve
for explanation i mean 
you mean i was too hot to hear reason mark
and i believe it is very true but i think we ununderstand
each other nov tomorrow i go with
my family to kingston where is an old house i
may still call mine come hither at thy leisure
mark or thy best speed as thou wilt but come
with thy father's consent
 woodstock
with my father in person said everard
if you will permit
be that answered the knight as he and
you will i think joceline will scarce shut the
door in thy face or bevis growl as he did after
poor louis kerneguy nay no more raptures
but good night mark good night and if thou
art not tired with the fatigue yesterday why
if you appear here at seven in the morning i think
we must bear with your company on the kingston
road
once more everard pressed the knight's hand
caressed bevis who received his kindness graciously
and went home to dreams happiness
which were realized so far as this motley world
permits within a few months afterwards

tired shakspeare and solitude he was ever a
welcome guest at his soninlaw's where he went
the more frequently that markham had given up
all concern in public affairs disapproving the
forcible dismissal the parliament and submitting
to cromweirs subsequent domination rather
as that which was the lesser evil than as to
a government which he regarded as legal cromwell
seemed ever willing to show himself his
friend but everard resenting highly the proposal
to deliver up the king which he considered
as an insult to his honour never answered
such advances and became on the contrary 
the opinion which was now generally prevalent
in the nation that a settled government could not
be obtained without the recall the banished
family there is no doubt that the personal
kindness which he had received from charles
rendered him the more readily disposed to such
a measure he was peremptory however in
declining all engagements during oliver's life
whose power he considered as too firmly fixed to
be shaken by any plots which could be formed
against it
woodstock 
meantime wildrake continued to be everard's
protected dependent as before though sometimes
the connexion tended not a little to his inconvenience
that respectable person indeed while
he remained stationary in his patron's house or
that the old knight discharged many little duties
in the family and won alice's heart by his
attention to the children teaching the boys 
whom they had three to ride fence toss the
pike and many similar exercises and above all
filling up a great blank in her father's existence
with whom he played at chess and backgammon
or read shakspeare or was clerk to prayers when
any sequestrated divine ventured to read the service
 the church or he found game for him
while the old gentleman continued to go a sporting
and especially he talked over the storming
 brentford and the battles edgehill
banbury roadwaydown and others themes
which the aged cavalier delighted in but which
he could not so well enter upon with colonel
everard who had gained his laurels in the parliament
service
the assistance which he received from 
woodstock
rake's society became more necessary after sir
henry was deprived his gallant and only son
who was slain in the fatal battle dunkirk
where unhappily english colours were displayed
on both the contending sides the french being
then allied with oliver who sent to their aid a
body auxiliaries and the troops the banished
king fighting in behalf the spaniards sir
henry received the melancholy news ike an old
man that is with more external composure than
could have been anticipated he dwelt for weeks
and months on the lines forwarded by the indefatigable
doctor rochcliffe superscribed in small
letters c r and subscribed louis kerneguy in
which the writer conjured him to endure this inestimable
loss with the greater firmness that he
had still left one son intimating himself who
would always regard him as a father
but in despite this balsam sorrow acting
imperceptibly and sucking the blood like a vampire
seemed gradually drying up the springs 
life and without any formed illness or outward
complaint the old man's strength and vigour
woodstock 
gradually abated and the ministry wildrake
proved daily more indispensable
it was not however always to be had the
cavalier was one those happy persons whom
a strong constitution an unreflecting mind and
exuberant spirits enable to play through their
whole lives the part a schoolboy happy for
the moment and careless consequences
once or twice every year when he had collected
a few pieces the cavaliers wildrake made a start
to london where as he described it he went on
the ramble drank as much wine as he could come
by and led a sheltering life to use his own
phrase among fostering cavaliers like himself
till by some rash speech or wild action he got
into the marshalsea the fleet or some other
prison from which he was to be delivered at the
expense interest money and sometimes a little
reputation
at length cromwell died his son resigned the
government and the various changes which followed
induced everard as well as many others
to adopt more active measures in the king's belial
everard even remitted considerable sums
woodstock
for his service but with the utmost caution and
corresponding with no intermediate agent but
with the chancellor himself to whom he communicated
much useful information upon public affairs
with all his prudence he was very nearly
engaged in the ineffectual rising booth and
middleton in the west and with great difficulty
escaped from the fatal consequences that illtimed
attempt after this although the estate
 the kingdom was trebly unsettled yet no card
seemed to turn up favourable to the royal cause
until the movement general monk from scotland
even then it was when at the point 
complete success that the fortunes charles
seemed at a lower ebb than ever especially when
intelligence had arrived at the little court which
he then kept in brussels that monk on arriving
in london had put himself under the orders 
the parliament
it was at this time and in the evening while
the king buckingham wilmot and some other
gallants his wandering court were engaged ina
convivial party that the chancellor clarendon
suddenly craved audience and entering with less
woodstock j
ceremony than he would have done at another
time announced extraordinary news for the messenger
he said he could say nothing saving that
he appeared to have drunk much and slept little 
but that he had brought a sure token credence
from a man for whose faith he would venture his
life the king demanded to see the messenger
himself
a man entered with something the manners 
a gentleman and more those a rakehelly debauchee
 his eyes swelled and inflamed his gait
disordered and stumbling partly through lack 
sleep partly through the means he had taken to
support his fatigue he staggered without ceremony
to the head the table seized the king's
hand which he mumbled like a piece gingerbread
while charles who began to recollect
him from his mode salutation was not very
much pleased that their meeting should have taken
place before so many witnesses
i bring good news said the uncouth messenger
 glorious news the king shall enjoy
his own again my feet are beautiful on the
mountains gad i have lived with presbyterians
till i have caught their language but we
s woodstock
are all one man's children now all your majesty's
poor babes the rump is all ruined in london
 bonfires flaming music playing rumps
roasting healths drinking london in a blaze 
light from the strand to rotherhithe tankards
clattering 
 we can guess at that said the duke 
buckingham
my old friend mark everard sent me oft
with the news i'm a villain if i've slept since
your majesty recollects me i am sure your
majesty remembers sa sa at the king's oak
at woodstock 
o we'll dance and sins and play
for twill be a joyous day
wheen the king shall enjoy his own again 
master wildrake i remember you well
said the king i trust the good news is certain

certain your majesty did i not hear the
bells did i not see the bonfires did i not
drink your majesty's health so often that my
legs would scarce carr me to the wharf it is
as certain as that i am poor roger ildrake 
ualtlcscamerc lincoln
woodstock 
the duke buckingham here whispered to
the king i have always suspected your majesty
kept odd company during the escape from
worcester but this seems a rare sample
why pretty much ike yourself and other
company i have kept here so many years as
stout a heart as empty a head said charles
as much lace though somewhat tarnished as
much brass on the brow and nearly as much
copper in the pocket
i would your majesty would intrust this
messenger good news with me to get the
truth out him said buckingham
thank your grace replied the king but
he has a will as well as yourself and such seldom
agree my lord chancellor hath wisdom
and to that we must trust ourselves master
wildrake you will go with my lord chancellor
who will bring us a report your tidings 
meantime i assure you that you shall be no
loser for being the first messenger good news
so saying he gave a signal to the chancellor to
take away wildrake whom he judged in his
present humour to be not unlikely to 
woodstock
cate some former passages at woodstock which
might rather entertain than edify the wits his
court
corroboration the joyful intelligence soon
arrived and wildrake was presented with a
handsome gratuity and small pension which by
the king's special desire had no duty whatever
attached to it
shortly afterwards all england was engaged
in crossing his favourite ditty 
oh the twentyninth may
it was a glorious day
when the king shall eijoy his own again
on that memorable day the king prepared to
make his progress from rochester to london
with a reception on the part his subjects so unanimously
cordial as made him say gaily it must
have been his own fault to stay so long away from
a country where his arrival gave so much joy
on horseback betwixt his brothers the dukes 
york and glocester the restored monarch trod
slowly over roads strewn with flowers by conduits
running wine under triumphal arches and
through streets hung with tapestry there were
the citizens in various bands some arrayed in coats
fostok 
 black velvet with gold chains some in military
suits cloth gold or cloth silver followed
by all those craftsmen who having hooted
the father from whitehall were now come to
shout the son into possession his ancestral palace
on his progress through blockhead he
passed that army which so long formidable to
england herself as well as to europe had been
the means restoring the monarchy which their
own hands had destroyed as the king passed
the last files this formidable host he came to
an open part the heath where many persons
 quality wide others inferior rank had stationed
themselves to gratulate him as he passed
towards the capital
there was one group however which attracted
peculiar attention from those around on account
 the respect shown to the party by the
soldiers who kept the ground and who whether
cavaliers or roundheads seemed to contest emulously
which should contribute most to their accommodation
 for both the elder and younger
gentlemen the party had been distinguished in
the civil war

it was a family group which the principal
figure was an old man seated in a chair having
a complacent smile on his face and a tear swelling
to his eye as he saw the banners wave on in
interminable succession and heard the multitude
shouting the long silenced acclamation god
save king charles his cheek was ashy pale
and his long beard bleached like the thistle down
his blue eye was cloudless yet it was obvious that
its vision was failing his motions were feeble
and he spoke little except when he answered the
prattle his grandchildren or asked a question
at his daughter who sate beside him matured
in matronly beauty or at colonel everard who
stood behind there too the stout yeoman joce
line joliffe still in his sylvan dress leaned like
a second benaiah on the quarterstaff that had
done the king good service in its day and his
wife a buxom matron as she had been a pretty
maiden laughed at her own consequence and
ever and anon joined her shrill notes to the stentorian
halloo which her husband added to the
general exclamation
three fine boys and two pretty girls prattled
woodstock 
around their grandfather who made them such
answers as suited their age and repeatedly passed
his withered hand over the fair locks the little
darlings while alice assisted by wildrake blazing
in a splendid dress and his eyes washed with
only a single cup canary took off the children's
attention from time to time lest they should weary
their grandfather we must not omit one other
remarkable figure in the group a gigantic dog
which bore the signs being at the extremity 
canine life being perhaps fifteen or sixteen years
old but though exhibiting but the ruin his
former appearance his eyes dim his joints stiff
his head slouched down and his gallant carriage
and graceful motions exchanged for a stiff rheumatic
hobbling gait the noble hound had lost
none his instinctive fondness for his master
to lie by sir henry s feet in the sun in summer
or by the fire in winter to raise his head to look
on him to lick his withered hand or his shrivelled
cheek from time to time seemed now all that
bevis lived for
three or four liveryservants attended to protect
this group from the thronging multitude 
iiiiij woodstock
but it needed not the high respectability and
unpretending simplicity their appearance gave
them even in th eyes the coarsest the people
an air patriarchal dignity which commanded
general regard and they sat upon the
bank which they had chosen for their station by
the way side as undisturbed as if they had been
in their own park
and now the distant clarion announced the
royal presence onward came pursuivant and
trumpet onward came plumes and cloth gold
and waving standards displayed and swords
gleaming to the sun and at length heading a
group the noblest in england and supported
by his royal brothers on either side onward came
king charles he had already halted more than
once in kindness perhaps as well as policy to
exchange a word nth persons whom he recognized
among the spectators and the shouts the
bysanders applauded a courtesy which seemed
so well timed but when he had gazed an instant
on the party we have described it was impossible
if even alice had been too much changed to be
recognized not instantly to know bevis and his
venerable master the monarch sprung from hi
wooustock st
horse and walked instantly up to the old knight
amid thundering acclamations which rose from
the multitudes around when they saw charles
with his own hand oppose the feeble attempts 
the old man to rise to do him homage gently
replacing him on his seat bless he said
father bless your son who has returned in
safety as you blessed him when he departed in
danger
 may god bless and preserve muttered
the old man overcome by his feelings and the
king to give him a few moments repose turned
to alice 
and you he said my fair guide how
have you been employed since our perilous nightwalk
 but i need not ask glancing round in
the service king and kingdom bringing up
subjects as loyal as their ancestors a fair lineage
by my faith and a beautiful sight to the eye
 an english king colonel everard we shall
see you i trust at whitehall here he nodded
to wildrake and thou joceline thou canst
hold thy quarterstaff with unhand sure thrust
forward the other palm
s woodstock
looking down in sheer bashfulness joceline
like a bull about to push extended to the king
over his lady's shoulder a hand as broad and hard
as a wooden trencher which the king filled with
gold coins buy a head gear for my friend phoebe
with some these said charles i she too has
been doing her duty to old england
the king then turned once more to the knight
who seemed making an effort to speak he took
his aged hand in both his own and stooped his
head towards him to catch his accents while the
old man detaining him with the other hand said
something faltering which charles could only
catch the quotation 
unthread the rude eye rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith
extricating himself therefore as gently as possible
from a scene which began to grow painfully
embarrassing the goodnatured king said speaking
with unusual distinctness to insure the old
man's comprehending him this is something
too public a place for all we have to say but if
you come not soon to see king charles at whitehall
he will send down louis kerneguy to visit
woodstock s
you that you may see how rational he is become
since his travels
so saying he once more pressed affectionately
the old man's hand bowed to alice and all
around and withdrew sir henry lee listening
with a smile which showed he comprehended the
gracious tendency what had been said the
old man leaned back on his seat and muttered
the nunc dimittis
 excuse me for having made you wait my
lords said the king as he mounted his horse 
had it not been for these good folks you might
have waited for me long enough move on sirs
the array moved on accordingly the sound 
trumpets and drums again rose amid the acclamations
which had been silent while the kingstopped
 while the effect the whole procession
resuming its motion was so splendidly dazzling
that even alice's anxiety about her father's health
was for a moment suspended while her eye followed
the long line varied brilliancy that proceeded
over the heath when she looked again at
sir henry she was startled to see that his cheek
which had gained some colour during his convert
iii a
t woodstock
nation with the king had relapsed into earthy
paleness that his eyes were closed and opened
not again and that his features expressed amid
their quietude a rigidity which is not that sleep
they ran to his assistance but it was too late
the light that burned so low in the socket had
leaped up and expired in one exhilarating flash
the rest must be conceived i have only to
add that his faithful dog did not survive him
many days and that the image bevis lies carved
at his master's feet on the tomb which was
erected to the memory sir henry lee

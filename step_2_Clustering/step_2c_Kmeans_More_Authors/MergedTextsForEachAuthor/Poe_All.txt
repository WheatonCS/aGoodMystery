ill-fated and mysterious man bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own

imagination and fallen in the flames of thine own youth again in fancy

i behold thee once more thy form hath risen before me not oh not

as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst

be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of

dim visions thine own venice which is a star-beloved elysium of the

sea and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a

deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters yes i

repeat it as thou shouldst be there are surely other worlds

than this other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude other

speculations than the speculations of the sophist who then shall call

thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary hours or

denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life which were but the

overflowings of thine everlasting energies



it was at venice beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di

sospiri that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom

i speak it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind

the circumstances of that meeting yet i remember ah how should i

forget the deep midnight the bridge of sighs the beauty of woman

and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal



it was a night of unusual gloom the great clock of the piazza had

sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening the square of the

campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights in the old ducal

palace were dying fast away i was returning home from the piazetta by

way of the grand canal but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth

of the canal san marco a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly

upon the night in one wild hysterical and long continued shriek

startled at the sound i sprang upon my feet while the gondolier

letting slip his single oar lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a

chance of recovery and we were consequently left to the guidance of the

current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel

like some huge and sable-feathered condor we were slowly drifting down

towards the bridge of sighs when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the

windows and down the staircases of the ducal palace turned all at once

that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day



a child slipping from the arms of its own mother had fallen from an

upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal the

quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim and although my own

gondola was the only one in sight many a stout swimmer already in the

stream was seeking in vain upon the surface the treasure which was

to be found alas only within the abyss upon the broad black marble

flagstones at the entrance of the palace and a few steps above the

water stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since

forgotten it was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration of all

venice the gayest of the gay the most lovely where all were

beautiful but still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni

and the mother of that fair child her first and only one who now deep

beneath the murky water was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her

sweet caresses and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon

her name



she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed in the

black mirror of marble beneath her her hair not as yet more than

half loosened for the night from its ball-room array clustered amid

a shower of diamonds round and round her classical head in curls like

those of the young hyacinth a snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed

to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form but the mid-summer

and midnight air was hot sullen and still and no motion in the

statue-like form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very

vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe

yet strange to say her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards

upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted in a

widely different direction the prison of the old republic is i think

the stateliest building in all venice but how could that lady gaze so

fixedly upon it when beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark

gloomy niche too yawns right opposite her chamber window what

then could there be in its shadows in its architecture in its

ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa di mentoni had not

wondered at a thousand times before nonsense who does not remember

that at such a time as this the eye like a shattered mirror

multiplies the images of its sorrow and sees in innumerable far-off

places the woe which is close at hand



many steps above the marchesa and within the arch of the water-gate

stood in full dress the satyr-like figure of mentoni himself he was

occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar and seemed ennuye to the

very death as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his

child stupified and aghast i had myself no power to move from the

upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must

have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous

appearance as with pale countenance and rigid limbs i floated down

among them in that funereal gondola



all efforts proved in vain many of the most energetic in the search

were relaxing their exertions and yielding to a gloomy sorrow there

seemed but little hope for the child how much less than for the

mother but now from the interior of that dark niche which has been

already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison and

as fronting the lattice of the marchesa a figure muffled in a cloak

stepped out within reach of the light and pausing a moment upon the

verge of the giddy descent plunged headlong into the canal as in an

instant afterwards he stood with the still living and breathing

child within his grasp upon the marble flagstones by the side of the

marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became unfastened

and falling in folds about his feet discovered to the wonder-stricken

spectators the graceful person of a very young man with the sound of

whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing



no word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now receive

her child she will press it to her heart she will cling to its little

form and smother it with her caresses alas another's arms have

taken it from the stranger another's arms have taken it away and

borne it afar off unnoticed into the palace and the marchesa her

lip her beautiful lip trembles tears are gathering in her eyes those

eyes which like pliny's acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes

tears are gathering in those eyes and see the entire woman thrills

throughout the soul and the statue has started into life the pallor

of the marble countenance the swelling of the marble bosom the very

purity of the marble feet we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide

of ungovernable crimson and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate

frame as a gentle air at napoli about the rich silver lilies in the

grass



why should that lady blush to this demand there is no answer except

that having left in the eager haste and terror of a mother's heart

the privacy of her own boudoir she has neglected to enthral her tiny

feet in their slippers and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian

shoulders that drapery which is their due what other possible reason

could there have been for her so blushing for the glance of those wild

appealing eyes for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom for the

convulsive pressure of that trembling hand that hand which fell

as mentoni turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand of the

stranger what reason could there have been for the low the singularly

low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in

bidding him adieu thou hast conquered she said or the murmurs of

the water deceived me thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise we

shall meet so let it be



 



the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the palace

and the stranger whom i now recognized stood alone upon the flags he

shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye glanced around in search

of a gondola i could not do less than offer him the service of my own

and he accepted the civility having obtained an oar at the water-gate

we proceeded together to his residence while he rapidly recovered his

self-possession and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of

great apparent cordiality



there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being minute the

person of the stranger let me call him by this title who to all the

world was still a stranger the person of the stranger is one of these

subjects in height he might have been below rather than above the

medium size although there were moments of intense passion when his

frame actually expanded and belied the assertion the light almost

slender symmetry of his figure promised more of that ready activity

which he evinced at the bridge of sighs than of that herculean strength

which he has been known to wield without an effort upon occasions of

more dangerous emergency with the mouth and chin of a deity singular

wild full liquid eyes whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense

and brilliant jet and a profusion of curling black hair from which

a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and

ivory his were features than which i have seen none more classically

regular except perhaps the marble ones of the emperor commodus yet

his countenance was nevertheless one of those which all men have seen

at some period of their lives and have never afterwards seen again it

had no peculiar it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened

upon the memory a countenance seen and instantly forgotten but

forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind

not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed at any time to

throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face but that

the mirror mirror-like retained no vestige of the passion when the

passion had departed



upon leaving him on the night of our adventure he solicited me in

what i thought an urgent manner to call upon him very early the

next morning shortly after sunrise i found myself accordingly at his

palazzo one of those huge structures of gloomy yet fantastic pomp

which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the

rialto i was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics into an

apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door

with an actual glare making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness



i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy report had spoken of his

possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of

ridiculous exaggeration but as i gazed about me i could not bring

myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have

supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around



although as i say the sun had arisen yet the room was still

brilliantly lighted up i judge from this circumstance as well as from

an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend that he had

not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night in the

architecture and embellishments of the chamber the evident design

had been to dazzle and astound little attention had been paid to the

decora of what is technically called keeping or to the proprieties

of nationality the eye wandered from object to object and rested upon

none neither the grotesques of the greek painters nor the sculptures

of the best italian days nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt rich

draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low

melancholy music whose origin was not to be discovered the senses were

oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes reeking up from strange

convolute censers together with multitudinous flaring and flickering

tongues of emerald and violet fire the rays of the newly risen sun

poured in upon the whole through windows formed each of a single pane

of crimson-tinted glass glancing to and fro in a thousand reflections

from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten

silver the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the

artificial light and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of

rich liquid-looking cloth of chili gold



ha ha ha ha ha ha laughed the proprietor motioning me to

a seat as i entered the room and throwing himself back at full-length

upon an ottoman i see said he perceiving that i could not

immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a

welcome i see you are astonished at my apartment at my statues my

pictures my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery

absolutely drunk eh with my magnificence but pardon me my dear

sir here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality

pardon me for my uncharitable laughter you appeared so utterly

astonished besides some things are so completely ludicrous that a man

must laugh or die to die laughing must be the most glorious of

all glorious deaths sir thomas more a very fine man was sir thomas

more sir thomas more died laughing you remember also in the

absurdities of ravisius textor there is a long list of characters who

came to the same magnificent end do you know however continued he

musingly that at sparta which is now palæ ochori at sparta i say

to the west of the citadel among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins is

a kind of socle upon which are still legible the letters aaem they

are undoubtedly part of peaaema now at sparta were a thousand temples

and shrines to a thousand different divinities how exceedingly strange

that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others but in

the present instance he resumed with a singular alteration of voice

and manner i have no right to be merry at your expense you might well

have been amazed europe cannot produce anything so fine as this my

little regal cabinet my other apartments are by no means of the same

order mere ultras of fashionable insipidity this is better than

fashion is it not yet this has but to be seen to become the rage that

is with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire

patrimony i have guarded however against any such profanation

with one exception you are the only human being besides myself and my

valet who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial

precincts since they have been bedizzened as you see



i bowed in acknowledgment for the overpowering sense of splendor and

perfume and music together with the unexpected eccentricity of

his address and manner prevented me from expressing in words my

appreciation of what i might have construed into a compliment



here he resumed arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around

the apartment here are paintings from the greeks to cimabue and from

cimabue to the present hour many are chosen as you see with little

deference to the opinions of virtu they are all however fitting

tapestry for a chamber such as this here too are some chefs

d'oeuvre of the unknown great and here unfinished designs by men

celebrated in their day whose very names the perspicacity of the

academies has left to silence and to me what think you said he

turning abruptly as he spoke what think you of this madonna della

pieta



it is guido's own i said with all the enthusiasm of my nature for i

had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness it is guido's

own how could you have obtained it she is undoubtedly in painting

what the venus is in sculpture



ha said he thoughtfully the venus the beautiful venus the venus

of the medici she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair part of

the left arm here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty

and all the right are restorations and in the coquetry of that right

arm lies i think the quintessence of all affectation give me the

canova the apollo too is a copy there can be no doubt of it blind

fool that i am who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo

i cannot help pity me i cannot help preferring the antinous was it

not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of

marble then michael angelo was by no means original in his couplet 



 non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto

 che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva



it has been or should be remarked that in the manner of the true

gentleman we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the

vulgar without being at once precisely able to determine in what such

difference consists allowing the remark to have applied in its full

force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance i felt it on that

eventful morning still more fully applicable to his moral temperament

and character nor can i better define that peculiarity of spirit which

seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings

than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought

pervading even his most trivial actions intruding upon his moments

of dalliance and interweaving itself with his very flashes of

merriment like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning

masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis



i could not help however repeatedly observing through the mingled

tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon

matters of little importance a certain air of trepidation a degree of

nervous unction in action and in speech an unquiet excitability of

manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable and upon some

occasions even filled me with alarm frequently too pausing in the

middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten

he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention as if either in

momentary expectation of a visiter or to sounds which must have had

existence in his imagination alone



it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction

that in turning over a page of the poet and scholar politian's

beautiful tragedy the orfeo the first native italian tragedy

which lay near me upon an ottoman i discovered a passage underlined in

pencil it was a passage towards the end of the third act a passage of

the most heart-stirring excitement a passage which although tainted

with impurity no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion no

woman without a sigh the whole page was blotted with fresh tears and

upon the opposite interleaf were the following english lines

written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my

acquaintance that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his own 



 thou wast that all to me love

 for which my soul did pine 

 a green isle in the sea love

 a fountain and a shrine

 all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers

 and all the flowers were mine

 ah dream too bright to last

 ah starry hope that didst arise

 but to be overcast

 a voice from out the future cries

 onward but o'er the past

 dim gulf my spirit hovering lies

 mute motionless aghast

 for alas alas with me

 the light of life is o'er

 no more no more no more

 such language holds the solemn sea

 to the sands upon the shore

 shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree

 or the stricken eagle soar

 now all my hours are trances

 and all my nightly dreams

 are where the dark eye glances

 and where thy footstep gleams

 in what ethereal dances

 by what italian streams

 alas for that accursed time

 they bore thee o'er the billow

 from love to titled age and crime

 and an unholy pillow 

 from me and from our misty clime

 where weeps the silver willow



that these lines were written in english a language with which i had

not believed their author acquainted afforded me little matter for

surprise i was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements and of

the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation to

be astonished at any similar discovery but the place of date i must

confess occasioned me no little amazement it had been originally

written london and afterwards carefully overscored not however so

effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye i say this

occasioned me no little amazement for i well remember that in a former

conversation with a friend i particularly inquired if he had at any

time met in london the marchesa di mentoni who for some years previous

to her marriage had resided in that city when his answer if i mistake

not gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of

great britain i might as well here mention that i have more than

once heard without of course giving credit to a report

involving so many improbabilities that the person of whom i speak was

not only by birth but in education an englishman



 



there is one painting said he without being aware of my notice of

the tragedy there is still one painting which you have not seen and

throwing aside a drapery he discovered a full-length portrait of the

marchesa aphrodite



 human art could have done no more in the delineation of her

superhuman beauty the same ethereal figure which stood before me the

preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace stood before me once

again but in the expression of the countenance which was beaming all

over with smiles there still lurked incomprehensible anomaly that

fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the

perfection of the beautiful her right arm lay folded over her bosom

with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase

one small fairy foot alone visible barely touched the earth and

scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to

encircle and enshrine her loveliness floated a pair of the most

delicately imagined wings my glance fell from the painting to the

figure of my friend and the vigorous words of chapman's bussy

d'ambois quivered instinctively upon my lips



 he is up

 there like a roman statue he will stand

 till death hath made him marble



come he said at length turning towards a table of richly enamelled

and massive silver upon which were a few goblets fantastically

stained together with two large etruscan vases fashioned in the same

extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait and

filled with what i supposed to be johannisberger come he said

abruptly let us drink it is early but let us drink it is indeed

early he continued musingly as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer

made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise it is

indeed early but what matters it let us drink let us pour out an

offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are

so eager to subdue and having made me pledge him in a bumper he

swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine



to dream he continued resuming the tone of his desultory

conversation as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the

magnificent vases to dream has been the business of my life i have

therefore framed for myself as you see a bower of dreams in the heart

of venice could i have erected a better you behold around you it is

true a medley of architectural embellishments the chastity of ionia

is offended by antediluvian devices and the sphynxes of egypt are

outstretched upon carpets of gold yet the effect is incongruous to

the timid alone proprieties of place and especially of time are

the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the

magnificent once i was myself a decorist but that sublimation of folly

has palled upon my soul all this is now the fitter for my purpose like

these arabesque censers my spirit is writhing in fire and the delirium

of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land

of real dreams whither i am now rapidly departing he here paused

abruptly bent his head to his bosom and seemed to listen to a sound

which i could not hear at length erecting his frame he looked

upwards and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of chichester



 stay for me there i will not fail

 to meet thee in that hollow vale



in the next instant confessing the power of the wine he threw himself

at full-length upon an ottoman



a quick step was now heard upon the staircase and a loud knock at

the door rapidly succeeded i was hastening to anticipate a second

disturbance when a page of mentoni's household burst into the room and

faltered out in a voice choking with emotion the incoherent words

my mistress my mistress poisoned poisoned oh beautiful oh

beautiful aphrodite



bewildered i flew to the ottoman and endeavored to arouse the sleeper

to a sense of the startling intelligence but his limbs were rigid his

lips were livid his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death

i staggered back towards the table my hand fell upon a cracked and

blackened goblet and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth

flashed suddenly over my soul

﻿misery is manifold the wretchedness of earth is multiform overreaching

the wide horizon as the rainbow its hues are as various as the hues of

that arch as distinct too yet as intimately blended overreaching the

wide horizon as the rainbow how is it that from beauty i have derived

a type of unloveliness from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow

but as in ethics evil is a consequence of good so in fact out of

joy is sorrow born either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of

to-day or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies

which might have been



my baptismal name is egaeus that of my family i will not mention yet

there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy gray

hereditary halls our line has been called a race of visionaries and

in many striking particulars in the character of the family

mansion in the frescos of the chief saloon in the tapestries of the

dormitories in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory but

more especially in the gallery of antique paintings in the fashion of

the library chamber and lastly in the very peculiar nature of the

library's contents there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant

the belief



the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber

and with its volumes of which latter i will say no more here died my

mother herein was i born but it is mere idleness to say that i had not

lived before that the soul has no previous existence you deny it let

us not argue the matter convinced myself i seek not to convince there

is however a remembrance of aerial forms of spiritual and meaning

eyes of sounds musical yet sad a remembrance which will not be

excluded a memory like a shadow vague variable indefinite unsteady

and like a shadow too in the impossibility of my getting rid of it

while the sunlight of my reason shall exist



in that chamber was i born thus awaking from the long night of what

seemed but was not nonentity at once into the very regions of fairy

land into a palace of imagination into the wild dominions of monastic

thought and erudition it is not singular that i gazed around me with a

startled and ardent eye that i loitered away my boyhood in books

and dissipated my youth in reverie but it is singular that as years

rolled away and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my

fathers it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs

of my life wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character

of my commonest thought the realities of the world affected me as

visions and as visions only while the wild ideas of the land of dreams

became in turn not the material of my every-day existence but in very

deed that existence utterly and solely in itself



 



berenice and i were cousins and we grew up together in my paternal

halls yet differently we grew i ill of health and buried in

gloom she agile graceful and overflowing with energy hers the

ramble on the hill-side mine the studies of the cloister i living

within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense

and painful meditation she roaming carelessly through life with

no thought of the shadows in her path or the silent flight of the

raven-winged hours berenice i call upon her name berenice and

from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are

startled at the sound ah vividly is her image before me now as in the

early days of her light-heartedness and joy oh gorgeous yet fantastic

beauty oh sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim oh naiad among its

fountains and then then all is mystery and terror and a tale which

should not be told disease a fatal disease fell like the simoon upon

her frame and even while i gazed upon her the spirit of change swept

over her pervading her mind her habits and her character and in a

manner the most subtle and terrible disturbing even the identity of

her person alas the destroyer came and went and the victim where is

she i knew her not or knew her no longer as berenice



among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and

primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the

moral and physical being of my cousin may be mentioned as the most

distressing and obstinate in its nature a species of epilepsy not

unfrequently terminating in trance itself trance very nearly

resembling positive dissolution and from which her manner of recovery

was in most instances startlingly abrupt in the mean time my own

disease for i have been told that i should call it by no other

appellation my own disease then grew rapidly upon me and assumed

finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form hourly

and momently gaining vigor and at length obtaining over me the most

incomprehensible ascendancy this monomania if i must so term it

consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in

metaphysical science termed the attentive it is more than probable

that i am not understood but i fear indeed that it is in no manner

possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader an adequate

idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which in my case

the powers of meditation not to speak technically busied and buried

themselves in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of

the universe



to muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some

frivolous device on the margin or in the typography of a book to

become absorbed for the better part of a summer's day in a quaint

shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor to lose

myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp

or the embers of a fire to dream away whole days over the perfume of a

flower to repeat monotonously some common word until the sound by

dint of frequent repetition ceased to convey any idea whatever to the

mind to lose all sense of motion or physical existence by means of

absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in such

were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a

condition of the mental faculties not indeed altogether unparalleled

but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation



yet let me not be misapprehended the undue earnest and morbid

attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous must

not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common

to all mankind and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent

imagination it was not even as might be at first supposed an extreme

condition or exaggeration of such propensity but primarily and

essentially distinct and different in the one instance the dreamer

or enthusiast being interested by an object usually not frivolous

imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions

and suggestions issuing therefrom until at the conclusion of a day

dream often replete with luxury he finds the incitamentum or first

cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten in my case the

primary object was invariably frivolous although assuming through

the medium of my distempered vision a refracted and unreal importance

few deductions if any were made and those few pertinaciously

returning in upon the original object as a centre the meditations were

never pleasurable and at the termination of the reverie the first

cause so far from being out of sight had attained that supernaturally

exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease in

a word the powers of mind more particularly exercised were with me as

i have said before the attentive and are with the day-dreamer the

speculative



my books at this epoch if they did not actually serve to irritate the

disorder partook it will be perceived largely in their imaginative

and inconsequential nature of the characteristic qualities of the

disorder itself i well remember among others the treatise of the

noble italian coelius secundus curio de amplitudine beati regni

dei st austin's great work the city of god and tertullian's de

carne christi in which the paradoxical sentence mortuus est dei

filius credible est quia ineptum est et sepultus resurrexit certum

est quia impossibile est occupied my undivided time for many weeks

of laborious and fruitless investigation



thus it will appear that shaken from its balance only by trivial

things my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by

ptolemy hephestion which steadily resisting the attacks of human

violence and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds trembled

only to the touch of the flower called asphodel and although to

a careless thinker it might appear a matter beyond doubt that the

alteration produced by her unhappy malady in the moral condition of

berenice would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense

and abnormal meditation whose nature i have been at some trouble in

explaining yet such was not in any degree the case in the lucid

intervals of my infirmity her calamity indeed gave me pain and

taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life i

did not fail to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonder-working

means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought

to pass but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of

my disease and were such as would have occurred under similar

circumstances to the ordinary mass of mankind true to its own

character my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling

changes wrought in the physical frame of berenice in the singular and

most appalling distortion of her personal identity



during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty most surely i had

never loved her in the strange anomaly of my existence feelings with

me had never been of the heart and my passions always were of the

mind through the gray of the early morning among the trellised shadows

of the forest at noonday and in the silence of my library at night she

had flitted by my eyes and i had seen her not as the living and

breathing berenice but as the berenice of a dream not as a being of

the earth earthy but as the abstraction of such a being not as a

thing to admire but to analyze not as an object of love but as

the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation and

now now i shuddered in her presence and grew pale at her approach

yet bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition i called to

mind that she had loved me long and in an evil moment i spoke to her

of marriage



and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching when upon

an afternoon in the winter of the year one of those unseasonably

warm calm and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful halcyon

 i sat and sat as i thought alone in the inner apartment of

the library but uplifting my eyes i saw that berenice stood before

me



was it my own excited imagination or the misty influence of the

atmosphere or the uncertain twilight of the chamber or the gray

draperies which fell around her figure that caused in it so vacillating

and indistinct an outline i could not tell she spoke no word and

i not for worlds could i have uttered a syllable an icy chill ran

through my frame a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me a

consuming curiosity pervaded my soul and sinking back upon the chair

i remained for some time breathless and motionless with my eyes riveted

upon her person alas its emaciation was excessive and not one vestige

of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour my burning

glances at length fell upon the face



the forehead was high and very pale and singularly placid and the

once jetty hair fell partially over it and overshadowed the hollow

temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow and jarring

discordantly in their fantastic character with the reigning melancholy

of the countenance the eyes were lifeless and lustreless and

seemingly pupilless and i shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare

to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips they parted and in a

smile of peculiar meaning the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed

themselves slowly to my view would to god that i had never beheld them

or that having done so i had died



 



the shutting of a door disturbed me and looking up i found that my

cousin had departed from the chamber but from the disordered chamber

of my brain had not alas departed and would not be driven away

the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth not a speck on their

surface not a shade on their enamel not an indenture in their

edges but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon

my memory i saw them now even more unequivocally than i beheld

them then the teeth the teeth they were here and there and

everywhere and visibly and palpably before me long narrow and

excessively white with the pale lips writhing about them as in the

very moment of their first terrible development then came the full

fury of my monomania and i struggled in vain against its strange and

irresistible influence in the multiplied objects of the external world

i had no thoughts but for the teeth for these i longed with a phrenzied

desire all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in

their single contemplation they they alone were present to the mental

eye and they in their sole individuality became the essence of

my mental life i held them in every light i turned them in every

attitude i surveyed their characteristics i dwelt upon their

peculiarities i pondered upon their conformation i mused upon the

alteration in their nature i shuddered as i assigned to them in

imagination a sensitive and sentient power and even when unassisted by

the lips a capability of moral expression of mademoiselle salle it

has been well said que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments and

of berenice i more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des

idees des idees ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me

des idees ah therefore it was that i coveted them so madly i felt

that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace in giving me

back to reason



and the evening closed in upon me thus and then the darkness came and

tarried and went and the day again dawned and the mists of a second

night were now gathering around and still i sat motionless in that

solitary room and still i sat buried in meditation and still the

phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy as with

the most vivid hideous distinctness it floated about amid the changing

lights and shadows of the chamber at length there broke in upon my

dreams a cry as of horror and dismay and thereunto after a pause

succeeded the sound of troubled voices intermingled with many low

moanings of sorrow or of pain i arose from my seat and throwing open

one of the doors of the library saw standing out in the ante-chamber

a servant maiden all in tears who told me that berenice was no more

she had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning and now at the

closing in of the night the grave was ready for its tenant and all the

preparations for the burial were completed



 



i found myself sitting in the library and again sitting there alone it

seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream

i knew that it was now midnight and i was well aware that since the

setting of the sun berenice had been interred but of that dreary

period which intervened i had no positive at least no definite

comprehension yet its memory was replete with horror horror more

horrible from being vague and terror more terrible from ambiguity it

was a fearful page in the record my existence written all over with

dim and hideous and unintelligible recollections i strived to

decypher them but in vain while ever and anon like the spirit of a

departed sound the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed

to be ringing in my ears i had done a deed what was it i asked myself

the question aloud and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered

me what was it



on the table beside me burned a lamp and near it lay a little box it

was of no remarkable character and i had seen it frequently before for

it was the property of the family physician but how came it there

upon my table and why did i shudder in regarding it these things were

in no manner to be accounted for and my eyes at length dropped to the

open pages of a book and to a sentence underscored therein the words

were the singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiat dicebant

mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem curas meas aliquantulum

fore levatas why then as i perused them did the hairs of my head

erect themselves on end and the blood of my body become congealed

within my veins



there came a light tap at the library door and pale as the tenant of a

tomb a menial entered upon tiptoe his looks were wild with terror

and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous husky and very low what said

he some broken sentences i heard he told of a wild cry disturbing the

silence of the night of the gathering together of the household of

a search in the direction of the sound and then his tones grew

thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave of

a disfigured body enshrouded yet still breathing still

palpitating still alive



he pointed to garments they were muddy and clotted with gore i spoke

not and he took me gently by the hand it was indented with the impress

of human nails he directed my attention to some object against the

wall i looked at it for some minutes it was a spade with a shriek i

bounded to the table and grasped the box that lay upon it but i could

not force it open and in my tremor it slipped from my hands and fell

heavily and burst into pieces and from it with a rattling sound

there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery intermingled with

thirty-two small white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered

to and fro about the floor



﻿



the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but

when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so well know

the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance

to a threat at length i would be avenged this was a point definitely

settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved

precluded the idea of risk i must not only punish but punish with

impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its

redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make

himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong



it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given

fortunato cause to doubt my good will i continued as was my wont to

smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at

the thought of his immolation



he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was a

man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his

connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit

for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and

opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian

millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen

was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this

respect i did not differ from him materially i was skillful in the

italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could



it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the

carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me with

excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley

he had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was

surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him

that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand



i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably

well you are looking to-day but i have received a pipe of what passes

for amontillado and i have my doubts



how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle

of the carnival



i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full

amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to

be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain



amontillado



i have my doubts



amontillado



and i must satisfy them



amontillado



as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a

critical turn it is he he will tell me 



luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry



and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your

own



come let us go



whither



to your vaults



my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive

you have an engagement luchesi 



i have no engagement come



my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with

which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp

they are encrusted with nitre



let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado

you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish

sherry from amontillado



thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask

of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i

suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo



there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in

honour of the time i had told them that i should not return until the

morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house

these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate

disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned



i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato

bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into

the vaults i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him

to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the

descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the

montresors



the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled

as he strode



the pipe said he



it is farther on said i but observe the white web-work which

gleams from these cavern walls



he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that

distilled the rheum of intoxication



nitre he asked at length



nitre i replied how long have you had that cough



ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh

ugh ugh



my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes



it is nothing he said at last



come i said with decision we will go back your health is

precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as

once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we

will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible besides

there is luchesi 



enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me

i shall not die of a cough



true true i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming

you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution a draught of

this medoc will defend us from the damps



here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of

its fellows that lay upon the mould



drink i said presenting him the wine



he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me

familiarly while his bells jingled



i drink he said to the buried that repose around us



and i to your long life



he again took my arm and we proceeded



these vaults he said are extensive



the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family



i forget your arms



a huge human foot d'or in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent

rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel



and the motto



nemo me impune lacessit



good he said



the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew

warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with

casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of

catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize

fortunato by an arm above the elbow



the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the

vaults we are below the river's bed the drops of moisture trickle

among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your

cough 



it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of

the medoc



i broke and reached him a flagon of de grave he emptied it at a

breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw

the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand



i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movement a grotesque one



you do not comprehend he said



not i i replied



then you are not of the brotherhood



how



you are not of the masons



yes yes i said yes yes



you impossible a mason



a mason i replied



a sign he said a sign



it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of

my roquelaire



you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed

to the amontillado



be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again

offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our

route in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low

arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep

crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to

glow than flame



at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less

spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the

vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three

sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner

from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down and lay

promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some

size within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we

perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width

three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for

no especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between

two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was

backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite



it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavoured to

pry into the depth of the recess its termination the feeble light did

not enable us to see



proceed i said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi 



he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily

forward while i followed immediately at his heels in an instant he

had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress

arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a moment more and i

had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples

distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of

these depended a short chain from the other a padlock throwing the

links about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure

it he was too much astounded to resist withdrawing the key i

stepped back from the recess



pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the

nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to

return no then i must positively leave you but i must first

render you all the little attentions in my power



the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his

astonishment



true i replied the amontillado



as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which

i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity

of building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of

my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche



i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered

that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the

earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth

of the recess it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a

long and obstinate silence i laid the second tier and the third and

the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain the

noise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to

it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labours and sat down upon

the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel

and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh

tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast i again

paused and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work threw a few

feeble rays upon the figure within



a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the

throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for a

brief moment i hesitated i trembled unsheathing my rapier i began

to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant

reassured me i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs

and felt satisfied i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of

him who clamoured i re-echoed i aided i surpassed them in volume

and in strength i did this and the clamourer grew still



it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close i had

completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had finished a

portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone

to be fitted and plastered in i struggled with its weight i placed

it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the

niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was

succeeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognizing as that

of the noble fortunato the voice said 



ha ha ha he he he a very good joke indeed an excellent jest

we shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo he he

he over our wine he he he



the amontillado i said



he he he he he he yes the amontillado but is it not getting

late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato

and the rest let us be gone



yes i said let us be gone



for the love of god montresor



yes i said for the love of god



but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply i grew impatient

i called aloud 



fortunato



no answer i called again 



fortunato 



no answer still i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and

let it fall within there came forth in reply only a jingling of the

bells my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs

i hastened to make an end of my labour i forced the last stone into

its position i plastered it up against the new masonry i re-erected

the old rampart of bones for the half of a century no mortal has

disturbed them in pace requiescat





﻿of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder that

the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would

have been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances

through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the

public at least for the present or until we had farther opportunities

for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or

exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of

many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal

of disbelief



it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i

comprehend them myself they are succinctly these



my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to

the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me

quite suddenly that in the series of experiments made hitherto there

had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission no person

had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen

first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any

susceptibility to the magnetic influence secondly whether if any

existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what

extent or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be

arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained

but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial from the

immensely important character of its consequences



in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these

particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar

the well-known compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author

under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish versions of

wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided principally

at harlaem ny since the year is or was particularly

noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much

resembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his

whiskers in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter

in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament

was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric

experiment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little

difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar

constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no

period positively or thoroughly under my control and in regard to

clairvoyance i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i

always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of

his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with

him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis it was his

custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a

matter neither to be avoided nor regretted



when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me it was

of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the

steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples

from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to

interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my surprise

his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although

he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never

before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was

of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect

to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged

between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the

period announced by his physicians as that of his decease



it is now rather more than seven months since i received from m

valdemar himself the subjoined note



my dear p -



you may as well come now d and f are agreed that i cannot hold out

beyond to-morrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very

nearly



valdemar



i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in

fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man's chamber i had not seen

him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the

brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes

were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was so extreme that the

skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones his expectoration was

excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless

in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree

of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative

medicines without aid and when i entered the room was occupied in

penciling memoranda in a pocket-book he was propped up in the bed by

pillows doctors d and f were in attendance



after pressing valdemar's hand i took these gentlemen aside and

obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition the left

lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous

state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of

vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if

not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass

of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive

perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the

ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of

comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very

unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and

the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days

independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism

of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact

diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m

valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then

seven o'clock on saturday evening



on quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself

doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their

intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the

patient about ten the next night



when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject

of his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of the

experiment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even

anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and

a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether

at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable

witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove

i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when

the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr

theodore l l relieved me from farther embarrassment it had been my

design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to

proceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valdemar and secondly

by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently

sinking fast



mr l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes

of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have

to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim



it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patient's hand i

begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l l whether he

m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of

mesmerizing him in his then condition



he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be i fear you

have mesmerized adding immediately afterwards deferred it too long



while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found

most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced with the

first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i

exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced

until some minutes after ten o'clock when doctors d and f called

according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i

designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was

already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitation exchanging

however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze

entirely into the right eye of the sufferer



by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was

stertorous and at intervals of half a minute



this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the

expiration of this period however a natural although a very deep

sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing

ceased that is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the

intervals were undiminished the patient's extremities were of an icy

coldness



at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the

mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that

expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in

cases of sleep-waking and which it is quite impossible to mistake

with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipient

sleep and with a few more i closed them altogether i was not

satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations

vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i had

completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in

a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were

nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin

the head was very slightly elevated



when i had accomplished this it was fully midnight and i requested

the gentlemen present to examine m valdemar's condition after a few

experiments they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of

mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly

excited dr d resolved at once to remain with the patient all

night while dr f took leave with a promise to return at daybreak

mr l l and the nurses remained



we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in

the morning when i approached him and found him in precisely the same

condition as when dr f went away that is to say he lay in the

same position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentle

scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the

lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and

as cold as marble still the general appearance was certainly not that

of death



as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence

his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gently

to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient i had

never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought of

succeeding now but to my astonishment his arm very readily although

feebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine i determined

to hazard a few words of conversation



m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i

perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the

question again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was

agitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves so

far as to display a white line of the ball the lips moved sluggishly

and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words



yes asleep now do not wake me let me die so



i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm

as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the sleep-waker

again



do you still feel pain in the breast m valdemar



the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no

pain i am dying



i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then and

nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr f who came a

little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding

the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror

to the lips he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again i did

so saying



m valdemar do you still sleep



as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the

interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak

at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost

inaudibly



yes still asleep dying



it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that

m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present

apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this

it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i

concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my

previous question



while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of

the sleep-waker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils

disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue

resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic

spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each

cheek went out at once i use this expression because the

suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the

extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip

at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had

previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible

jerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the

swollen and blackened tongue i presume that no member of the party

then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors but so hideous

beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that

there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed



i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every

reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business

however simply to proceed



there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and

concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the

nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue

this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period

there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice such as it

would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or

three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i

might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow

but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no

similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two

particulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think might

fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation as well adapted to

convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the

voice seemed to reach our ears at least mine from a vast distance

or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it

impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself

comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of

touch



i have spoken both of sound and of voice i mean to say that

the sound was one of distinct of even wonderfully thrillingly

distinct syllabification m valdemar spoke obviously in reply to the

question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had asked him

it will be remembered if he still slept he now said



yes no i have been sleeping and now now i am dead



no person present even affected to deny or attempted to repress the

unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were

so well calculated to convey mr l l the student swooned the nurses

immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own

impressions i would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader

for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silently without the utterance

of a word in endeavors to revive mr l l when he came to himself

we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemar's

condition



it remained in all respects as i have last described it with the

exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an

attempt to draw blood from the arm failed i should mention too that

this limb was no farther subject to my will i endeavored in vain to

make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication

indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory

movement of the tongue whenever i addressed m valdemar a question

he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer sufficient

volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he

seemed utterly insensible although i endeavored to place each member

of the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have now

related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's

state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten o'clock i

left the house in company with the two physicians and mr l l



in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition

remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the

propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty

in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was

evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been

arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to

awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least

his speedy dissolution



from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly

seven months we continued to make daily calls at m valdemar's house

accompanied now and then by medical and other friends all this time

the sleeper-waker remained exactly as i have last described him the

nurses attentions were continual



it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment

of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps

unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to

so much discussion in private circles to so much of what i cannot help

thinking unwarranted popular feeling



for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from the mesmeric trance i

made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful

the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the

iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering

of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish

ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor



it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the patient's

arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr f then intimated

a desire to have me put a question i did so as follows



m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes

now



there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the

tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the

jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous

voice which i have already described broke forth



for god's sake quick quick put me to sleep or quick waken

me quick i say to you that i am dead



i was thoroughly unnerved and for an instant remained undecided what to

do at first i made an endeavor to re-compose the patient but failing

in this through total abeyance of the will i retraced my steps and as

earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt i soon saw that i

should be successful or at least i soon fancied that my success would

be complete and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the

patient awaken



for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human

being could have been prepared



as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead

dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the

sufferer his whole frame at once within the space of a single minute

or even less shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands

upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass

of loathsome of detestable putridity



﻿during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the

year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had

been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of

country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew

on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how

it was but with the first glimpse of the building a sense of

insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the

feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable because poetic

sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest

natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the scene

before me upon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the

domain upon the bleak walls upon the vacant eye-like windows upon a

few rank sedges and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees with an

utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation

more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium the

bitter lapse into everyday life the hideous dropping off of the veil

there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heart an unredeemed

dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture

into aught of the sublime what was it i paused to think what was it

that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a

mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that

crowded upon me as i pondered i was forced to fall back upon the

unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are

combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus

affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations

beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different

arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the

picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its

capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined

my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in

unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed down but with a shudder

even more thrilling than before upon the remodelled and inverted images

of the gray sedge and the ghastly tree-stems and the vacant and

eye-like windows



nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a

sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of

my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last

meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of

the country a letter from him which in its wildly importunate nature

had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of

nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illness of a mental

disorder which oppressed him and of an earnest desire to see me as his

best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by

the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it

was the manner in which all this and much more was said it was the

apparent heart that went with his request which allowed me no

room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still

considered a very singular summons



although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really

knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and

habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been

noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament

displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and

manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive

charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps

even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of

musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the

stem of the usher race all time-honored as it was had put forth at no

period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay

in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and

very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered

while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of

the premises with the accredited character of the people and while

speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long

lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the other it was this

deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating

transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which

had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title

of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house

of usher an appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the

peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion



i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish

experiment that of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the

first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness

of the rapid increase of my superstition for why should i not so term

it served mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have

long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a

basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again

uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there

grew in my mind a strange fancy a fancy so ridiculous indeed that i

but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed

me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that

about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar

to themselves and their immediate vicinity an atmosphere which had

no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the

decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarn a pestilent and

mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leaden-hued



shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more

narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed

to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been

great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine

tangled web-work from the eaves yet all this was apart from any

extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and

there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect

adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual

stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality

of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected

vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond

this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little

token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might

have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the

roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag

direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn



noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a

servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of

the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence

through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio

of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know

not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already

spoken while the objects around me while the carvings of the ceilings

the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors

and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were

but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my

infancy while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all

this i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which

ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the

physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled

expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with

trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered

me into the presence of his master



the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows

were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black

oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams

of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes

and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects

around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles

of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling

dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse

comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments

lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i

felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and

irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all



upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at

full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in

it i at first thought of an overdone cordiality of the constrained

effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance however at his

countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for

some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half

of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered

in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that

i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me

with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face

had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye

large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and

very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a

delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar

formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence

of a want of moral energy hair of a more than web-like softness and

tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions

of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be

forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character

of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay

so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor

of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things

startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to

grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated

rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect

its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity



in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence an

inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble

and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy an excessive

nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been

prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain

boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical

conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and

sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the

animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic

concision that abrupt weighty unhurried and hollow-sounding

enunciation that leaden self-balanced and perfectly modulated

guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the

irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense

excitement



it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest

desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he

entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his

malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one

for which he despaired to find a remedy a mere nervous affection he

immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed

itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed

them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and

the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much

from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone

endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors

of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint

light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed

instruments which did not inspire him with horror



to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall

perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus

and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future

not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought

of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this

intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger

except in its absolute effect in terror in this unnerved in this

pitiable condition i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive

when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the

grim phantasm fear



i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal

hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was

enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling

which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured

forth in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed

in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated an influence which some

peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had

by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spirit an effect

which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn

into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the

morale of his existence



he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the

peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more

natural and far more palpable origin to the severe and long-continued

illness indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution of a tenderly

beloved sister his sole companion for long years his last and only

relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can

never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last

of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline

for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the

apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i

regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread and

yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of

stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a

door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and

eagerly the countenance of the brother but he had buried his face

in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary

wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many

passionate tears



the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her

physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person

and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical

character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne

up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself

finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival

at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with

inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer

and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus

probably be the last i should obtain that the lady at least while

living would be seen by me no more



for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or

myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to

alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or

i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking

guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more

unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did

i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which

darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all

objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation

of gloom



i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus

spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in

any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies

or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an

excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over

all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among

other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and

amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the

paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch

by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly

because i shuddered knowing not why from these paintings vivid as

their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more

than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely

written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs

he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that

mortal was roderick usher for me at least in the circumstances then

surrounding me there arose out of the pure abstractions which the

hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass an intensity of

intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation

of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli



one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so

rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although

feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely

long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and

without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design

served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding

depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any

portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of

light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout

and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor



i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which

rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of

certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow

limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave

birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances

but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted

for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the

words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself

with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental

collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded

as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial

excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily

remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as

he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i

fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness

on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her

throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very

nearly if not accurately thus



 i

 in the greenest of our valleys

 by good angels tenanted

 once a fair and stately palace 

 radiant palace reared its head

 in the monarch thought's dominion 

 it stood there

 never seraph spread a pinion

 over fabric half so fair

 ii

 banners yellow glorious golden

 on its roof did float and flow

 this all this was in the olden

 time long ago

 and every gentle air that dallied

 in that sweet day

 along the ramparts plumed and pallid

 a winged odor went away

 iii

 wanderers in that happy valley

 through two luminous windows saw

 spirits moving musically

 to a lute's well-tunéd law

 round about a throne where sitting

 porphyrogene

 in state his glory well befitting

 the ruler of the realm was seen

 iv

 and all with pearl and ruby glowing

 was the fair palace door

 through which came flowing flowing flowing

 and sparkling evermore

 a troop of echoes whose sweet duty

 was but to sing

 in voices of surpassing beauty

 the wit and wisdom of their king

 v

 but evil things in robes of sorrow

 assailed the monarch's high estate

 ah let us mourn for never morrow

 shall dawn upon him desolate

 and round about his home the glory

 that blushed and bloomed

 is but a dim-remembered story

 of the old time entombed

 vi

 and travellers now within that valley

 through the red-litten windows see

 vast forms that move fantastically

 to a discordant melody

 while like a rapid ghastly river

 through the pale door

 a hideous throng rush out forever

 and laugh but smile no more



i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into

a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher's

which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men

 have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which

he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the

sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the

idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain

conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express

the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief

however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray

stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience

had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of

these stones in the order of their arrangement as well as in that of

the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which

stood around above all in the long undisturbed endurance of this

arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn

its evidence the evidence of the sentience was to be seen he

said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain

condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the

walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet

importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the

destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw him what

he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none

landaff see chemical essays vol v



our books the books which for years had formed no small portion of

the mental existence of the invalid were as might be supposed in

strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over

such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of

machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage

of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean

d'indaginé and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of

tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was

a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the

dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela

about the old african satyrs and oegipans over which usher would sit

dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal

of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic the manual of

a forgotten church the vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae

maguntinae



i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its

probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having

informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his

intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its

final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls

of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular

proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute the

brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration

of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain

obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the

remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family i will

not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the

person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at

the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a

harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution



at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for

the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone

bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had

been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive

atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small

damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great

depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my

own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal

times for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep and in later days as a

place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance

as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway

through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the

door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense

weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its

hinges



having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of

horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin

and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between

the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher

divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which

i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that

sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between

them our glances however rested not long upon the dead for we could

not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in

the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly

cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and

the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is

so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having

secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely

less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house



and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change

came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his

ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or

forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and

objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible

a more ghastly hue but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone

out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a

tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized

his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly

agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which

he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged

to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i

beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the

profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was

no wonder that his condition terrified that it infected me i felt

creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of

his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions



it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the

seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the

donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came

not near my couch while the hours waned and waned away i struggled to

reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to

believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering

influence of the gloomy furniture of the room of the dark and tattered

draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising

tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily

about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an

irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there

sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking

this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows

and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber

harkened i know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted

me to certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses

of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an

intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on

my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the

night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into

which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment



i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an

adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognised it as

that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch

at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual

cadaverously wan but moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in

his eyes an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his

air appalled me but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had

so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief



and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about

him for some moments in silence you have not then seen it but stay

you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he

hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm



the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet

it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one

wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently

collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent

alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of

the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house

did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they

flew careering from all points against each other without passing

away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did

not prevent our perceiving this yet we had no glimpse of the moon or

stars nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the

under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all

terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural

light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation

which hung about and enshrouded the mansion



you must not you shall not behold this said i shudderingly to

usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat

these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena

not uncommon or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in

the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the air is

chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite

romances i will read and you shall listen and so we will pass away

this terrible night together



the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir

launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of usher's more in sad

jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and

unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty

and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book

immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement

which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history

of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness

of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the

wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened or apparently

harkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated

myself upon the success of my design



i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred

the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission

into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by

force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus



and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now

mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had

drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth

was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his

shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace

outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the

door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so

cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and

hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest



at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused

for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited

fancy had deceived me it appeared to me that from some very remote

portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might

have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled

and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which

sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt

the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the

rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled

noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing

surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the

story



but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore

enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but

in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and

of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a

floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass

with this legend enwritten 



 who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin

 who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win



and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon

which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so

horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to

close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like

whereof was never before heard



here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild

amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance

i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i

found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh

protracted and most unusual screaming or grating sound the exact

counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's

unnatural shriek as described by the romancer



oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and

most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations

in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained

sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the

sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that

he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange

alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his

demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought

round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber

and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw

that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had

dropped upon his breast yet i knew that he was not asleep from the

wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile

the motion of his body too was at variance with this idea for he

rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway

having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir

launcelot which thus proceeded



and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the

dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up

of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of

the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement

of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth

tarried not for his full coming but feel down at his feet upon the

silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound



no sooner had these syllables passed my lips than as if a shield

of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of

silver i became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous

yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved i leaped to

my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i

rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly

before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony

rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a

strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his

lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur

as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length

drank in the hideous import of his words



not hear it yes i hear it and have heard it

long long long many minutes many hours many days have i heard

it yet i dared not oh pity me miserable wretch that i am i dared

not i dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i

not that my senses were acute i now tell you that i heard her first

feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard them many

many days ago yet i dared not i dared not speak and

now to-night ethelred ha ha the breaking of the hermit's door

and the death-cry of the dragon and the clangor of the shield say

rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of

her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault

oh whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying

to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair

do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart

madman here he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his

syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soul madman

i tell you that she now stands without the door



as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found

the potency of a spell the huge antique pannels to which the speaker

pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony

jaws it was the work of the rushing gust but then without those doors

there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline

of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some

bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment

she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold then

with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her

brother and in her violent and now final death-agonies bore him to the

floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated



from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm

was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old

causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned

to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house

and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full

setting and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once

barely-discernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending

from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while

i gazed this fissure rapidly widened there came a fierce breath of

the whirlwind the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my

sight my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder there

was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand

waters and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and

silently over the fragments of the house of usher

﻿i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed

to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to

tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that

his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers

they all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men

as well as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or

whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i

have never been quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean

joker is a rara avis in terris



about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the

king troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for

breadth in a jest and would often put up with length for the sake

of it over-niceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais

gargantua to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical

jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones



at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone

out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still

retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were

expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moment's notice

in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table



our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he

required something in the way of folly if only to counterbalance

the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers not to

mention himself



his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his

value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also

a dwarf and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days

as fools and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through

their days days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both

a jester to laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already

observed your jesters in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred are fat

round and unwieldy so that it was no small source of self-gratulation

with our king that in hop-frog this was the fool's name he possessed

a triplicate treasure in one person



i believe the name hop-frog was not that given to the dwarf by his

sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent

of the several ministers on account of his inability to walk as

other men do in fact hop-frog could only get along by a sort of

interjectional gait something between a leap and a wriggle a movement

that afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to

the king for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a

constitutional swelling of the head the king by his whole court was

accounted a capital figure



but although hop-frog through the distortion of his legs could

move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the

prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his

arms by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled

him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes

were in question or any thing else to climb at such exercises he

certainly much more resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a

frog



i am not able to say with precision from what country hop-frog

originally came it was from some barbarous region however that

no person ever heard of a vast distance from the court of our king

hop-frog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself

although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been

forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces

and sent as presents to the king by one of his ever-victorious

generals



under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close

intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became

sworn friends hop-frog who although he made a great deal of sport

was by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta

many services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty

although a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed

much influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the

benefit of hop-frog



on some grand state occasion i forgot what the king determined to

have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind

occurred at our court then the talents both of hop-frog and trippetta

were sure to be called into play hop-frog in especial was so

inventive in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel

characters and arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could

be done it seems without his assistance



the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been

fitted up under trippetta's eye with every kind of device which could

possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of

expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed

that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made

up their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a

month in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision

anywhere except in the case of the king and his seven minsters why

they hesitated i never could tell unless they did it by way of a joke

more probably they found it difficult on account of being so fat to

make up their minds at all events time flew and as a last resort

they sent for trippetta and hop-frog



when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found

him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council

but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that

hop-frog was not fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to

madness and madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his

practical jokes and took pleasure in forcing hop-frog to drink and as

the king called it to be merry



come here hop-frog said he as the jester and his friend entered the

room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here

hop-frog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention

we want characters characters man something novel out of the way we

are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the wine will

brighten your wits



hop-frog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these

advances from the king but the effort was too much it happened to

be the poor dwarf's birthday and the command to drink to his absent

friends forced the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell

into the goblet as he took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant



ah ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly drained the

beaker see what a glass of good wine can do why your eyes are

shining already



poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect

of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous

he placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the

company with a half insane stare they all seemed highly amused at the

success of the king's joke



and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man



yes said the king come lend us your assistance characters my fine

fellow we stand in need of characters all of us ha ha ha and

as this was seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the

seven



hop-frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly



come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest



i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf

abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine



endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you mean by that

ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine here drink this

and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple who

merely gazed at it gasping for breath



drink i say shouted the monster or by the fiends-



the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers

smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarch's seat

and falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend



the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at

her audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or say how most

becomingly to express his indignation at last without uttering a

syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of

the brimming goblet in her face



the poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh

resumed her position at the foot of the table



there was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the

falling of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard it was

interrupted by a low but harsh and protracted grating sound which

seemed to come at once from every corner of the room



what what what are you making that noise for demanded the king

turning furiously to the dwarf



the latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his

intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face

merely ejaculated



i i how could it have been me



the sound appeared to come from without observed one of the

courtiers i fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill

upon his cage-wires



true replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion

but on the honor of a knight i could have sworn that it was the

gritting of this vagabond's teeth



hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object

to any one's laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very

repulsive teeth moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow

as much wine as desired the monarch was pacified and having drained

another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect hop-frog entered at

once and with spirit into the plans for the masquerade



i cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very

tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just

after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her

face just after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was

making that odd noise outside the window there came into my mind a

capital diversion one of my own country frolics often enacted

among us at our masquerades but here it will be new altogether

unfortunately however it requires a company of eight persons and-



here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the

coincidence eight to a fraction i and my seven ministers come what

is the diversion



we call it replied the cripple the eight chained ourang-outangs

and it really is excellent sport if well enacted



we will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering

his eyelids



the beauty of the game continued hop-frog lies in the fright it

occasions among the women



capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry



i will equip you as ourang-outangs proceeded the dwarf leave all

that to me the resemblance shall be so striking that the company of

masqueraders will take you for real beasts and of course they will be

as much terrified as astonished



oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king hop-frog i will make a

man of you



the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their

jangling you are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers

your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by

eight chained ourang-outangs imagined to be real ones by most of the

company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately

and gorgeously habited men and women the contrast is inimitable



it must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was

growing late to put in execution the scheme of hop-frog



his mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple but

effective enough for his purposes the animals in question had at the

epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized

world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently

beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to

nature was thus thought to be secured



the king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet

shirts and drawers they were then saturated with tar at this stage

of the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the

suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the

eight by ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the

ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu a thick

coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar

a long chain was now procured first it was passed about the waist of

the king and tied then about another of the party and also tied

then about all successively in the same manner when this chaining

arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each

other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear

natural hop-frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters

at right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the

present day by those who capture chimpanzees or other large apes in

borneo



the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a

circular room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only

through a single window at top at night the season for which the

apartment was especially designed it was illuminated principally by a

large chandelier depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light

and lowered or elevated by means of a counter-balance as usual but

in order not to look unsightly this latter passed outside the cupola

and over the roof



the arrangements of the room had been left to trippetta's

superintendence but in some particulars it seems she had been guided

by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf at his suggestion it was

that on this occasion the chandelier was removed its waxen drippings

which in weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would

have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who

on account of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected

to keep from out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier

additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the

war and a flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand

of each of the caryaides caryatides that stood against the wall some

fifty or sixty altogether



the eight ourang-outangs taking hop-frog's advice waited patiently

until midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders

before making their appearance no sooner had the clock ceased striking

however than they rushed or rather rolled in all together for the

impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to

stumble as they entered



the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the

heart of the king with glee as had been anticipated there were not

a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be

beasts of some kind in reality if not precisely ourang-outangs many

of the women swooned with affright and had not the king taken the

precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon

have expiated their frolic in their blood as it was a general rush

was made for the doors but the king had ordered them to be locked

immediately upon his entrance and at the dwarf's suggestion the keys

had been deposited with him



while the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only

to his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the

pressure of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier

ordinarily hung and which had been drawn up on its removal might have

been seen very gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came

within three feet of the floor



soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the

hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and

of course in immediate contact with the chain while they were thus

situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels

inciting them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain

at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle

diametrically and at right angles here with the rapidity of thought

he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend

and in an instant by some unseen agency the chandelier-chain was

drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an

inevitable consequence to drag the ourang-outangs together in close

connection and face to face



the masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure

from their alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a

well-contrived pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the

predicament of the apes



leave them to me now screamed hop-frog his shrill voice making

itself easily heard through all the din leave them to me i fancy i

know them if i can only get a good look at them i can soon tell who

they are



here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the

wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides he returned

as he went to the centre of the room-leaping with the agility of a

monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the

chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs

and still screaming i shall soon find out who they are



and now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed

with laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the

chain flew violently up for about thirty feet dragging with it the

dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs and leaving them suspended in

mid-air between the sky-light and the floor hop-frog clinging to the

chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to

the eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued

to thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover

who they were



so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a

dead silence of about a minute's duration ensued it was broken by

just such a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the

attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine

in the face of trippetta but on the present occasion there could be

no question as to whence the sound issued it came from the fang like

teeth of the dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at

the mouth and glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the

upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions



ah ha said at length the infuriated jester ah ha i begin to see

who these people are now here pretending to scrutinize the king more

closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him

and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame in less than half

a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely amid the

shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horror-stricken

and without the power to render them the slightest assistance



at length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the

jester to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as

he made this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into

silence the dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke



i now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers

are they are a great king and his seven privy-councillors a king who

does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors

who abet him in the outrage as for myself i am simply hop-frog the

jester and this is my last jest



owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which

it adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech

before the work of vengeance was complete the eight corpses swung in

their chains a fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable

mass the cripple hurled his torch at them clambered leisurely to the

ceiling and disappeared through the sky-light



it is supposed that trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon

had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that

together they effected their escape to their own country for neither

was seen again



﻿about twelve o'clock one night in the month of october and during the

chivalrous reign of the third edward two seamen belonging to the crew

of the free and easy a trading schooner plying between sluys and the

thames and then at anchor in that river were much astonished to find

themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of st

andrews london which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a

jolly tar



the room although ill-contrived smoke-blackened low-pitched and in

every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places

at the period was nevertheless in the opinion of the grotesque groups

scattered here and there within it sufficiently well adapted to its

purpose



of these groups our two seamen formed i think the most interesting if

not the most conspicuous



the one who appeared to be the elder and whom his companion addressed

by the characteristic appellation of legs was at the same time much

the taller of the two he might have measured six feet and a half and

an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary

consequence of an altitude so enormous superfluities in height were

however more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects

he was exceedingly thin and might as his associates asserted have

answered when drunk for a pennant at the mast-head or when sober

have served for a jib-boom but these jests and others of a similar

nature had evidently produced at no time any effect upon the

cachinnatory muscles of the tar with high cheek-bones a large

hawk-nose retreating chin fallen under-jaw and huge protruding white

eyes the expression of his countenance although tinged with a species

of dogged indifference to matters and things in general was not the

less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or

description



the younger seaman was in all outward appearance the converse of his

companion his stature could not have exceeded four feet a pair

of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat unwieldy figure while his

unusually short and thick arms with no ordinary fists at their

extremities swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a

sea-turtle small eyes of no particular color twinkled far back in his

head his nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his

round full and purple face and his thick upper-lip rested upon the

still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction

much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals

he evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous

half-quizzical and stared up occasionally in his face as the red

setting sun stares up at the crags of ben nevis



various and eventful however had been the peregrinations of the worthy

couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during

the earlier hours of the night funds even the most ample are not

always everlasting and it was with empty pockets our friends had

ventured upon the present hostelrie



at the precise period then when this history properly commences legs

and his fellow hugh tarpaulin sat each with both elbows resting upon

the large oaken table in the middle of the floor and with a hand upon

either cheek they were eyeing from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for

humming-stuff the portentous words no chalk which to their

indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of

that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny not that the

gift of decyphering written characters a gift among the commonalty

of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of

inditing could in strict justice have been laid to the charge of

either disciple of the sea but there was to say the truth a certain

twist in the formation of the letters an indescribable lee-lurch about

the whole -which foreboded in the opinion of both seamen a long run

of dirty weather and determined them at once in the allegorical words

of legs himself to pump ship clew up all sail and scud before the

wind



having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale and looped up

the points of their short doublets they finally made a bolt for the

street although tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place mistaking

it for the door yet their escape was at length happily effected and

half after twelve o'clock found our heroes ripe for mischief and

running for life down a dark alley in the direction of st andrew's

stair hotly pursued by the landlady of the jolly tar



at the epoch of this eventful tale and periodically for many years

before and after all england but more especially the metropolis

resounded with the fearful cry of plague the city was in a great

measure depopulated and in those horrible regions in the vicinity of

the thames where amid the dark narrow and filthy lanes and alleys

the demon of disease was supposed to have had his nativity awe terror

and superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad



by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban and all

persons forbidden under pain of death to intrude upon their dismal

solitude yet neither the mandate of the monarch nor the huge barriers

erected at the entrances of the streets nor the prospect of that

loathsome death which with almost absolute certainty overwhelmed

the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure prevented the

unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped by the hand

of nightly rapine of every article such as iron brass or lead-work

which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account



above all it was usually found upon the annual winter opening of the

barriers that locks bolts and secret cellars had proved but

slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which in

consideration of the risk and trouble of removal many of the numerous

dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust during

the period of exile to so insufficient a security



but there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed

these doings to the agency of human hands pest-spirits plague-goblins

and fever-demons were the popular imps of mischief and tales so

blood-chilling were hourly told that the whole mass of forbidden

buildings was at length enveloped in terror as in a shroud and

the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own

depreciations had created leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited

district to gloom silence pestilence and death



it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned and which

indicated the region beyond to be under the pest-ban that in

scrambling down an alley legs and the worthy hugh tarpaulin found their

progress suddenly impeded to return was out of the question and no

time was to be lost as their pursuers were close upon their heels with

thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work

was a trifle and maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise

and liquor they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure and

holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings were soon

bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses



had they not indeed been intoxicated beyond moral sense their reeling

footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation the

air was cold and misty the paving-stones loosened from their beds lay

in wild disorder amid the tall rank grass which sprang up around the

feet and ankles fallen houses choked up the streets the most fetid and

poisonous smells everywhere prevailed and by the aid of that ghastly

light which even at midnight never fails to emanate from a vapory and

pestilential at atmosphere might be discerned lying in the by-paths and

alleys or rotting in the windowless habitations the carcass of many

a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very

perpetration of his robbery



 but it lay not in the power of images or sensations or impediments

such as these to stay the course of men who naturally brave and at

that time especially brimful of courage and of humming-stuff would

have reeled as straight as their condition might have permitted

undauntedly into the very jaws of death onward still onward stalked

the grim legs making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells

like the terrific war-whoop of the indian and onward still onward

rolled the dumpy tarpaulin hanging on to the doublet of his more active

companion and far surpassing the latter's most strenuous exertions in

the way of vocal music by bull-roarings in basso from the profundity

of his stentorian lungs



they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence their

way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible the

paths more narrow and more intricate huge stones and beams falling

momently from the decaying roofs above them gave evidence by their

sullen and heavy descent of the vast height of the surrounding houses

and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through

frequent heaps of rubbish it was by no means seldom that the hand fell

upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse



suddenly as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and

ghastly-looking building a yell more than usually shrill from the

throat of the excited legs was replied to from within in a rapid

succession of wild laughter-like and fiendish shrieks nothing daunted

at sounds which of such a nature at such a time and in such a place

might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire

the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door burst it open and

staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses



the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of

an undertaker but an open trap-door in a corner of the floor near the

entrance looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars whose depths

the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored

with their appropriate contents in the middle of the room stood a

table in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared

to be punch bottles of various wines and cordials together with

jugs pitchers and flagons of every shape and quality were scattered

profusely upon the board around it upon coffin-tressels was seated a

company of six this company i will endeavor to delineate one by one



fronting the entrance and elevated a little above his companions sat a

personage who appeared to be the president of the table his stature was

gaunt and tall and legs was confounded to behold in him a figure

more emaciated than himself his face was as yellow as saffron but

no feature excepting one alone was sufficiently marked to merit a

particular description this one consisted in a forehead so unusually

and hideously lofty as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown

of flesh superadded upon the natural head his mouth was puckered and

dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability and his eyes as

indeed the eyes of all at table were glazed over with the fumes

of intoxication this gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a

richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall wrapped negligently around

his form after the fashion of a spanish cloak his head was stuck full

of sable hearse-plumes which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and

knowing air and in his right hand he held a huge human thigh-bone

with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of

the company for a song



opposite him and with her back to the door was a lady of no whit the

less extraordinary character although quite as tall as the person just

described she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation she

was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy and her figure resembled

nearly that of the huge puncheon of october beer which stood with the

head driven in close by her side in a corner of the chamber her

face was exceedingly round red and full and the same peculiarity or

rather want of peculiarity attached itself to her countenance which i

before mentioned in the case of the president that is to say only one

feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate

characterization indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately observed that

the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the

party every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular

portion of physiognomy with the lady in question this portion proved

to be the mouth commencing at the right ear it swept with a terrific

chasm to the left the short pendants which she wore in either auricle

continually bobbing into the aperture she made however every exertion

to keep her mouth closed and look dignified in a dress consisting of a

newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin with a

crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin



at her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to

patronise this delicate little creature in the trembling of her wasted

fingers in the livid hue of her lips and in the slight hectic spot

which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion gave evident indications

of a galloping consumption an air of gave extreme haut ton however

pervaded her whole appearance she wore in a graceful and degage manner

a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest india lawn her hair

hung in ringlets over her neck a soft smile played about her mouth but

her nose extremely long thin sinuous flexible and pimpled hung down

far below her under lip and in spite of the delicate manner in which

she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue gave

to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression



over against her and upon the left of the dropsical lady was seated a

little puffy wheezing and gouty old man whose cheeks reposed upon the

shoulders of their owner like two huge bladders of oporto wine with

his arms folded and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table

he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration he evidently

prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance but took

more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout

this to say the truth must have cost him no little money and was made

to fit him exceedingly well being fashioned from one of the curiously

embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons

which in england and elsewhere are customarily hung up in some

conspicuous place upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy



next to him and at the right hand of the president was a gentleman

in long white hose and cotton drawers his frame shook in a ridiculous

manner with a fit of what tarpaulin called the horrors his jaws

which had been newly shaved were tightly tied up by a bandage of

muslin and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists i

i prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the

table a precaution rendered necessary in the opinion of legs by

the peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage a pair of

prodigious ears nevertheless which it was no doubt found impossible

to confine towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment and were

occasionally pricked up in a spasm at the sound of the drawing of a

cork



fronting him sixthly and lastly was situated a singularly

stiff-looking personage who being afflicted with paralysis must

to speak seriously have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating

habiliments he was habited somewhat uniquely in a new and handsome

mahogany coffin its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the

wearer and extended over it in the fashion of a hood giving to the

entire face an air of indescribable interest arm-holes had been cut in

the sides for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience but

the dress nevertheless prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect

as his associates and as he lay reclining against his tressel at an

angle of forty-five degrees a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their

awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own

enormity



before each of the party lay a portion of a skull which was used as

a drinking cup overhead was suspended a human skeleton by means of a

rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling

the other limb confined by no such fetter stuck off from the body at

right angles causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and

twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found

its way into the apartment in the cranium of this hideous thing lay

quantity of ignited charcoal which threw a fitful but vivid light over

the entire scene while coffins and other wares appertaining to the

shop of an undertaker were piled high up around the room and against

the windows preventing any ray from escaping into the street



at sight of this extraordinary assembly and of their still more

extraordinary paraphernalia our two seamen did not conduct themselves

with that degree of decorum which might have been expected legs

leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing dropped

his lower jaw still lower than usual and spread open his eyes to their

fullest extent while hugh tarpaulin stooping down so as to bring his

nose upon a level with the table and spreading out a palm upon either

knee burst into a long loud and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed

and immoderate laughter



without however taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude the

tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders nodded to them

in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes and arising took

each by an arm and led him to a seat which some others of the company

had placed in the meantime for his accommodation legs to all this

offered not the slightest resistance but sat down as he was directed

while the gallant hugh removing his coffin tressel from its station

near the head of the table to the vicinity of the little consumptive

lady in the winding sheet plumped down by her side in high glee

and pouring out a skull of red wine quaffed it to their better

acquaintance but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin

seemed exceedingly nettled and serious consequences might have ensued

had not the president rapping upon the table with his truncheon

diverted the attention of all present to the following speech



it becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion 



avast there interrupted legs looking very serious avast there a

bit i say and tell us who the devil ye all are and what business ye

have here rigged off like the foul fiends and swilling the snug blue

ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate will wimble the

undertaker



at this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding all the original company

half started to their feet and uttered the same rapid succession of

wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the

seamen the president however was the first to recover his composure

and at length turning to legs with great dignity recommenced



most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of

guests so illustrious unbidden though they be know then that in these

dominions i am monarch and here rule with undivided empire under the

title of king pest the first



this apartment which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of

will wimble the undertaker a man whom we know not and whose plebeian

appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears this

apartment i say is the dais-chamber of our palace devoted to the

councils of our kingdom and to other sacred and lofty purposes



the noble lady who sits opposite is queen pest our serene consort the

other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family and

wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of

his grace the arch duke pest-iferous his grace the duke

pest-ilential his grace the duke tem-pest and her serene highness

the arch duchess ana-pest



as regards continued he your demand of the business upon which we

sit here in council we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns

and concerns alone our own private and regal interest and is in no

manner important to any other than ourself but in consideration of

those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves

entitled we will furthermore explain that we are here this night

prepared by deep research and accurate investigation to examine

analyze and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit the

incomprehensible qualities and nature of those inestimable treasures of

the palate the wines ales and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis by

so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of

that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all whose dominions are

unlimited and whose name is death



whose name is davy jones ejaculated tarpaulin helping the lady by

his side to a skull of liqueur and pouring out a second for himself



profane varlet said the president now turning his attention to

the worthy hugh profane and execrable wretch we have said that in

consideration of those rights which even in thy filthy person we feel

no inclination to violate we have condescended to make reply to thy

rude and unseasonable inquiries we nevertheless for your unhallowed

intrusion upon our councils believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy

companion in each a gallon of black strap having imbibed which to the

prosperity of our kingdom at a single draught and upon your bended

knees ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way or

remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table according to your

respective and individual pleasures



it would be a matter of utter impossibility replied legs whom the

assumptions and dignity of king pest the first had evidently inspired

some feelings of respect and who arose and steadied himself by the

table as he spoke it would please your majesty be a matter of utter

impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same

liquor which your majesty has just mentioned to say nothing of the

stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast and not to

mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different

sea-ports i have at present a full cargo of humming stuff taken in

and duly paid for at the sign of the jolly tar you will therefore

please your majesty be so good as to take the will for the deed for by

no manner of means either can i or will i swallow another drop least

of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the hall of

black strap



belay that interrupted tarpaulin astonished not more at the length

of his companion's speech than at the nature of his refusal belay that

you tubber and i say legs none of your palaver my hull is still

light although i confess you yourself seem to be a little top-heavy

and as for the matter of your share of the cargo why rather than raise

a squall i would find stowageroom for it myself but 



this proceeding interposed the president is by no means in

accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence which is in its

nature median and not to be altered or recalled the conditions we have

imposed must be fulfilled to the letter and that without a moment's

hesitation in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be

tied neck and heels together and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead

of october beer



a sentence a sentence a righteous and just sentence a glorious

decree a most worthy and upright and holy condemnation shouted the

pest family altogether the king elevated his forehead into innumerable

wrinkles the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows the

lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro the gentleman in

the cotton drawers pricked up his ears she of the shroud gasped like a

dying fish and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes



ugh ugh ugh chuckled tarpaulin without heeding the general

excitation ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh i was

saying said he i was saying when mr king pest poked in his

marlin-spike that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or

less of black strap it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not

overstowed but when it comes to drinking the health of the devil whom

god assoilzie and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored

majesty there whom i know as well as i know myself to be a sinner to

be nobody in the whole world but tim hurlygurly the stage-player why

it's quite another guess sort of a thing and utterly and altogether

past my comprehension



he was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity at the name

tim hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats



treason shouted his majesty king pest the first



treason said the little man with the gout



treason screamed the arch duchess ana-pest



treason muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up



treason growled he of the coffin



treason treason shrieked her majesty of the mouth and seizing by

the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate tarpaulin who had just

commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur she lifted him

high into the air and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open

puncheon of his beloved ale bobbing up and down for a few seconds

like an apple in a bowl of toddy he at length finally disappeared

amid the whirlpool of foam which in the already effervescent liquor

his struggles easily succeeded in creating



not tamely however did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his

companion jostling king pest through the open trap the valiant legs

slammed the door down upon him with an oath and strode towards the

centre of the room here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the

table he laid it about him with so much energy and good will that as

the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment he succeeded

in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout

rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of

october ale and hugh tarpaulin he rolled it over and over in an

instant out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce so impetuous so

overwhelming that the room was flooded from wall to wall the loaded

table was overturned the tressels were thrown upon their backs the tub

of punch into the fire-place and the ladies into hysterics piles of

death-furniture floundered about jugs pitchers and carboys mingled

promiscuously in the melee and wicker flagons encountered desperately

with bottles of junk the man with the horrors was drowned upon the

spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin and the

victorious legs seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud rushed

out with her into the street and made a bee-line for the free and

easy followed under easy sail by the redoubtable hugh tarpaulin who

having sneezed three or four times panted and puffed after him with the

arch duchess ana-pest



﻿and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries

of the will with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all

things by nature of its intentness man doth not yield himself to the

angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his

feeble will joseph glanvill



i cannot for my soul remember how when or even precisely where

i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia long years have since

elapsed and my memory is feeble through much suffering or perhaps i

cannot now bring these points to mind because in truth the character

of my beloved her rare learning her singular yet placid cast of

beauty and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical

language made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and

stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown yet

i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large old

decaying city near the rhine of her family i have surely heard her

speak that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted ligeia

ligeia in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden

impressions of the outward world it is by that sweet word alone by

ligeia that i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is

no more and now while i write a recollection flashes upon me that

i have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my

betrothed and who became the partner of my studies and finally the

wife of my bosom was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia or

was it a test of my strength of affection that i should institute

no inquiries upon this point or was it rather a caprice of my own a

wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion

i but indistinctly recall the fact itself what wonder that i have

utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it

and indeed if ever she the wan and the misty-winged ashtophet of

idolatrous egypt presided as they tell over marriages ill-omened

then most surely she presided over mine



there is one dear topic however on which my memory falls me not it is

the person of ligeia in stature she was tall somewhat slender and in

her latter days even emaciated i would in vain attempt to portray

the majesty the quiet ease of her demeanor or the incomprehensible

lightness and elasticity of her footfall she came and departed as a

shadow i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save

by the dear music of her low sweet voice as she placed her marble hand

upon my shoulder in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her it was

the radiance of an opium-dream an airy and spirit-lifting vision

more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the

slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were not of

that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the

classical labors of the heathen there is no exquisite beauty says

bacon lord verulam speaking truly of all the forms and genera of

beauty without some strangeness in the proportion yet although i saw

that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity although

i perceived that her loveliness was indeed exquisite and felt that

there was much of strangeness pervading it yet i have tried in vain

to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of the

strange i examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead it

was faultless how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so

divine the skin rivalling the purest ivory the commanding extent and

repose the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples and

then the raven-black the glossy the luxuriant and naturally-curling

tresses setting forth the full force of the homeric epithet

hyacinthine i looked at the delicate outlines of the nose and

nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a

similar perfection there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface

the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline the same

harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit i regarded the

sweet mouth here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly the

magnificent turn of the short upper lip the soft voluptuous slumber

of the under the dimples which sported and the color which spoke the

teeth glancing back with a brilliancy almost startling every ray of

the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid yet most

exultingly radiant of all smiles i scrutinized the formation of the

chin and here too i found the gentleness of breadth the softness

and the majesty the fullness and the spirituality of the greek the

contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream to cleomenes the

son of the athenian and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia



for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique it might have been

too that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord

verulam alludes they were i must believe far larger than the ordinary

eyes of our own race they were even fuller than the fullest of the

gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of nourjahad yet it was only

at intervals in moments of intense excitement that this peculiarity

became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia and at such moments was

her beauty in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps the beauty of

beings either above or apart from the earth the beauty of the fabulous

houri of the turk the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black

and far over them hung jetty lashes of great length the brows

slightly irregular in outline had the same tint the strangeness

however which i found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the

formation or the color or the brilliancy of the features and must

after all be referred to the expression ah word of no meaning behind

whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much

of the spiritual the expression of the eyes of ligeia how for long

hours have i pondered upon it how have i through the whole of a

midsummer night struggled to fathom it what was it that something

more profound than the well of democritus which lay far within the

pupils of my beloved what was it i was possessed with a passion to

discover those eyes those large those shining those divine orbs

they became to me twin stars of leda and i to them devoutest of

astrologers



there is no point among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the

science of mind more thrillingly exciting than the fact never i

believe noticed in the schools that in our endeavors to recall to

memory something long forgotten we often find ourselves upon the very

verge of remembrance without being able in the end to remember and

thus how frequently in my intense scrutiny of ligeia's eyes have

i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression felt it

approaching yet not quite be mine and so at length entirely depart

and strange oh strangest mystery of all i found in the commonest

objects of the universe a circle of analogies to that expression i

mean to say that subsequently to the period when ligeia's beauty passed

into my spirit there dwelling as in a shrine i derived from many

existences in the material world a sentiment such as i felt always

aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs yet not the more

could i define that sentiment or analyze or even steadily view it

i recognized it let me repeat sometimes in the survey of a

rapidly-growing vine in the contemplation of a moth a butterfly a

chrysalis a stream of running water i have felt it in the ocean in

the falling of a meteor i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged

people and there are one or two stars in heaven one especially a

star of the sixth magnitude double and changeable to be found near the

large star in lyra in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made

aware of the feeling i have been filled with it by certain sounds from

stringed instruments and not unfrequently by passages from books among

innumerable other instances i well remember something in a volume of

joseph glanvill which perhaps merely from its quaintness who shall

say never failed to inspire me with the sentiment and the will

therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries of the will

with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all things by

nature of its intentness man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto

death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will



length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace

indeed some remote connection between this passage in the english

moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia an intensity in

thought action or speech was possibly in her a result or at least

an index of that gigantic volition which during our long intercourse

failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence

of all the women whom i have ever known she the outwardly calm the

ever-placid ligeia was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous

vultures of stern passion and of such passion i could form no estimate

save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so

delighted and appalled me by the almost magical melody modulation

distinctness and placidity of her very low voice and by the fierce

energy rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of

utterance of the wild words which she habitually uttered



i have spoken of the learning of ligeia it was immense such as i

have never known in woman in the classical tongues was she deeply

proficient and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the

modern dialects of europe i have never known her at fault indeed upon

any theme of the most admired because simply the most abstruse of the

boasted erudition of the academy have i ever found ligeia at fault how

singularly how thrillingly this one point in the nature of my wife has

forced itself at this late period only upon my attention i said her

knowledge was such as i have never known in woman but where breathes

the man who has traversed and successfully all the wide areas of

moral physical and mathematical science i saw not then what i now

clearly perceive that the acquisitions of ligeia were gigantic were

astounding yet i was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to

resign myself with a child-like confidence to her guidance through the

chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily

occupied during the earlier years of our marriage with how vast a

triumph with how vivid a delight with how much of all that is

ethereal in hope did i feel as she bent over me in studies but little

sought but less known that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding

before me down whose long gorgeous and all untrodden path i might at

length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to

be forbidden



how poignant then must have been the grief with which after some

years i beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves

and fly away without ligeia i was but as a child groping benighted

her presence her readings alone rendered vividly luminous the many

mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed wanting

the radiant lustre of her eyes letters lambent and golden grew duller

than saturnian lead and now those eyes shone less and less frequently

upon the pages over which i pored ligeia grew ill the wild eyes blazed

with a too too glorious effulgence the pale fingers became of the

transparent waxen hue of the grave and the blue veins upon the lofty

forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle

emotion i saw that she must die and i struggled desperately in spirit

with the grim azrael and the struggles of the passionate wife were to

my astonishment even more energetic than my own there had been much in

her stern nature to impress me with the belief that to her death would

have come without its terrors but not so words are impotent to convey

any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled

with the shadow i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle i would

have soothed i would have reasoned but in the intensity of her wild

desire for life for life but for life solace and reason were

the uttermost folly yet not until the last instance amid the most

convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit was shaken the external

placidity of her demeanor her voice grew more gentle grew more

low yet i would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly

uttered words my brain reeled as i hearkened entranced to a melody

more than mortal to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had

never before known



that she loved me i should not have doubted and i might have been

easily aware that in a bosom such as hers love would have reigned

no ordinary passion but in death only was i fully impressed with the

strength of her affection for long hours detaining my hand would she

pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate

devotion amounted to idolatry how had i deserved to be so blessed by

such confessions how had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal

of my beloved in the hour of her making them but upon this subject

i cannot bear to dilate let me say only that in ligeia's more than

womanly abandonment to a love alas all unmerited all unworthily

bestowed i at length recognized the principle of her longing with so

wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly

away it is this wild longing it is this eager vehemence of desire

for life but for life that i have no power to portray no utterance

capable of expressing



at high noon of the night in which she departed beckoning me

peremptorily to her side she bade me repeat certain verses composed by

herself not many days before i obeyed her they were these



 lo tis a gala night

 within the lonesome latter years

 an angel throng bewinged bedight

 in veils and drowned in tears

 sit in a theatre to see

 a play of hopes and fears

 while the orchestra breathes fitfully

 the music of the spheres



 mimes in the form of god on high

 mutter and mumble low

 and hither and thither fly

 mere puppets they who come and go

 at bidding of vast formless things

 that shift the scenery to and fro

 flapping from out their condor wings

 invisible wo



 that motley drama oh be sure

 it shall not be forgot

 with its phantom chased forever more

 by a crowd that seize it not

 through a circle that ever returneth in

 to the self-same spot

 and much of madness and more of sin

 and horror the soul of the plot



 but see amid the mimic rout

 a crawling shape intrude

 a blood-red thing that writhes from out

 the scenic solitude

 it writhes it writhes with mortal pangs

 the mimes become its food

 and the seraphs sob at vermin fangs

 in human gore imbued



 out out are the lights out all

 and over each quivering form

 the curtain a funeral pall

 comes down with the rush of a storm

 and the angels all pallid and wan

 uprising unveiling affirm

 that the play is the tragedy man

 and its hero the conqueror worm



o god half shrieked ligeia leaping to her feet and extending

her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement as i made an end of these

lines o god o divine father shall these things be undeviatingly

so shall this conqueror be not once conquered are we not part and

parcel in thee who who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its

vigor man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly

save only through the weakness of his feeble will



and now as if exhausted with emotion she suffered her white arms to

fall and returned solemnly to her bed of death and as she breathed her

last sighs there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips i

bent to them my ear and distinguished again the concluding words of

the passage in glanvill man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto

death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will



she died and i crushed into the very dust with sorrow could no

longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and

decaying city by the rhine i had no lack of what the world calls

wealth ligeia had brought me far more very far more than ordinarily

falls to the lot of mortals after a few months therefore of weary and

aimless wandering i purchased and put in some repair an abbey which

i shall not name in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of

fair england the gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building the

almost savage aspect of the domain the many melancholy and time-honored

memories connected with both had much in unison with the feelings of

utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial

region of the country yet although the external abbey with its verdant

decay hanging about it suffered but little alteration i gave way with

a child-like perversity and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating

my sorrows to a display of more than regal magnificence within for

such follies even in childhood i had imbibed a taste and now they came

back to me as if in the dotage of grief alas i feel how much even

of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and

fantastic draperies in the solemn carvings of egypt in the wild

cornices and furniture in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted

gold i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium and my

labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams but these

absurdities must not pause to detail let me speak only of that one

chamber ever accursed whither in a moment of mental alienation i

led from the altar as my bride as the successor of the unforgotten

ligeia the fair-haired and blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion of

tremaine



there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of

that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me where were the

souls of the haughty family of the bride when through thirst of gold

they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked a

maiden and a daughter so beloved i have said that i minutely remember

the details of the chamber yet i am sadly forgetful on topics of deep

moment and here there was no system no keeping in the fantastic

display to take hold upon the memory the room lay in a high turret of

the castellated abbey was pentagonal in shape and of capacious

size occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole

window an immense sheet of unbroken glass from venice a single pane

and tinted of a leaden hue so that the rays of either the sun or moon

passing through it fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within

over the upper portion of this huge window extended the trellice-work

of an aged vine which clambered up the massy walls of the turret the

ceiling of gloomy-looking oak was excessively lofty vaulted and

elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a

semi-gothic semi-druidical device from out the most central recess of

this melancholy vaulting depended by a single chain of gold with long

links a huge censer of the same metal saracenic in pattern and with

many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them

as if endued with a serpent vitality a continual succession of

parti-colored fires



some few ottomans and golden candelabra of eastern figure were in

various stations about and there was the couch too bridal couch of

an indian model and low and sculptured of solid ebony with a

pall-like canopy above in each of the angles of the chamber stood on

end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite from the tombs of the kings

over against luxor with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture

but in the draping of the apartment lay alas the chief phantasy of

all the lofty walls gigantic in height even unproportionably

so were hung from summit to foot in vast folds with a heavy and

massive-looking tapestry tapestry of a material which was found alike

as a carpet on the floor as a covering for the ottomans and the

ebony bed as a canopy for the bed and as the gorgeous volutes of the

curtains which partially shaded the window the material was the richest

cloth of gold it was spotted all over at irregular intervals with

arabesque figures about a foot in diameter and wrought upon the cloth

in patterns of the most jetty black but these figures partook of the

true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point

of view by a contrivance now common and indeed traceable to a very

remote period of antiquity they were made changeable in aspect to one

entering the room they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities but

upon a farther advance this appearance gradually departed and step by

step as the visitor moved his station in the chamber he saw himself

surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to

the superstition of the norman or arise in the guilty slumbers of the

monk the phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial

introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the

draperies giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole



in halls such as these in a bridal chamber such as this i passed with

the lady of tremaine the unhallowed hours of the first month of our

marriage passed them with but little disquietude that my wife dreaded

the fierce moodiness of my temper that she shunned me and loved me but

little i could not help perceiving but it gave me rather pleasure than

otherwise i loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than

to man my memory flew back oh with what intensity of regret to

ligeia the beloved the august the beautiful the entombed i revelled

in recollections of her purity of her wisdom of her lofty her

ethereal nature of her passionate her idolatrous love now then did

my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own

in the excitement of my opium dreams for i was habitually fettered in

the shackles of the drug i would call aloud upon her name during the

silence of the night or among the sheltered recesses of the glens

by day as if through the wild eagerness the solemn passion the

consuming ardor of my longing for the departed i could restore her to

the pathway she had abandoned ah could it be forever upon the earth



about the commencement of the second month of the marriage the lady

rowena was attacked with sudden illness from which her recovery was

slow the fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy and

in her perturbed state of half-slumber she spoke of sounds and of

motions in and about the chamber of the turret which i concluded

had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy or perhaps in the

phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself she became at length

convalescent finally well yet but a brief period elapsed ere a second

more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering and from

this attack her frame at all times feeble never altogether recovered

her illnesses were after this epoch of alarming character and of more

alarming recurrence defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions

of her physicians with the increase of the chronic disease which

had thus apparently taken too sure hold upon her constitution to

be eradicated by human means i could not fall to observe a similar

increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament and in her

excitability by trivial causes of fear she spoke again and now more

frequently and pertinaciously of the sounds of the slight sounds and

of the unusual motions among the tapestries to which she had formerly

alluded



one night near the closing in of september she pressed this

distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention she

had just awakened from an unquiet slumber and i had been watching

with feelings half of anxiety half of vague terror the workings of her

emaciated countenance i sat by the side of her ebony bed upon one of

the ottomans of india she partly arose and spoke in an earnest low

whisper of sounds which she then heard but which i could not hear of

motions which she then saw but which i could not perceive the wind was

rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries and i wished to show her

what let me confess it i could not all believe that those almost

inarticulate breathings and those very gentle variations of the figures

upon the wall were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of

the wind but a deadly pallor overspreading her face had proved to me

that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless she appeared to

be fainting and no attendants were within call i remembered where

was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her

physicians and hastened across the chamber to procure it but as

i stepped beneath the light of the censer two circumstances of a

startling nature attracted my attention i had felt that some palpable

although invisible object had passed lightly by my person and i saw

that there lay upon the golden carpet in the very middle of the rich

lustre thrown from the censer a shadow a faint indefinite shadow of

angelic aspect such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade

but i was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium and

heeded these things but little nor spoke of them to rowena having

found the wine i recrossed the chamber and poured out a gobletful

which i held to the lips of the fainting lady she had now partially

recovered however and took the vessel herself while i sank upon an

ottoman near me with my eyes fastened upon her person it was then that

i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet and

near the couch and in a second thereafter as rowena was in the act

of raising the wine to her lips i saw or may have dreamed that i

saw fall within the goblet as if from some invisible spring in the

atmosphere of the room three or four large drops of a brilliant and

ruby colored fluid if this i saw not so rowena she swallowed the wine

unhesitatingly and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which

must after all i considered have been but the suggestion of a vivid

imagination rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady by the

opium and by the hour



yet i cannot conceal it from my own perception that immediately

subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops a rapid change for the worse

took place in the disorder of my wife so that on the third subsequent

night the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb and on the

fourth i sat alone with her shrouded body in that fantastic chamber

which had received her as my bride wild visions opium-engendered

flitted shadow-like before me i gazed with unquiet eye upon the

sarcophagi in the angles of the room upon the varying figures of the

drapery and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer

overhead my eyes then fell as i called to mind the circumstances of

a former night to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had

seen the faint traces of the shadow it was there however no longer

and breathing with greater freedom i turned my glances to the pallid

and rigid figure upon the bed then rushed upon me a thousand memories

of ligeia and then came back upon my heart with the turbulent violence

of a flood the whole of that unutterable wo with which i had regarded

her thus enshrouded the night waned and still with a bosom full of

bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved i remained gazing

upon the body of rowena



it might have been midnight or perhaps earlier or later for i had

taken no note of time when a sob low gentle but very distinct

startled me from my revery i felt that it came from the bed of

ebony the bed of death i listened in an agony of superstitious

terror but there was no repetition of the sound i strained my vision

to detect any motion in the corpse but there was not the slightest

perceptible yet i could not have been deceived i had heard the noise

however faint and my soul was awakened within me i resolutely and

perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body many minutes

elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the

mystery at length it became evident that a slight a very feeble and

barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks

and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids through a species of

unutterable horror and awe for which the language of mortality has no

sufficiently energetic expression i felt my heart cease to beat my

limbs grow rigid where i sat yet a sense of duty finally operated to

restore my self-possession i could no longer doubt that we had been

precipitate in our preparations that rowena still lived it was

necessary that some immediate exertion be made yet turret was

altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the

servants there were none within call i had no means of summoning them

to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes and this i could

not venture to do i therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call

back the spirit ill hovering in a short period it was certain however

that a relapse had taken place the color disappeared from both eyelid

and cheek leaving a wanness even more than that of marble the lips

became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression

of death a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the

surface of the body and all the usual rigorous illness immediately

supervened i fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which i had

been so startlingly aroused and again gave myself up to passionate

waking visions of ligeia



an hour thus elapsed when could it be possible i was a second

time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed i

listened in extremity of horror the sound came again it was a sigh

rushing to the corpse i saw distinctly saw a tremor upon the lips in

a minute afterward they relaxed disclosing a bright line of the pearly

teeth amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which

had hitherto reigned there alone i felt that my vision grew dim that

my reason wandered and it was only by a violent effort that i at length

succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had

pointed out there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the

cheek and throat a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame there

was even a slight pulsation at the heart the lady lived and with

redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of restoration i chafed

and bathed the temples and the hands and used every exertion which

experience and no little medical reading could suggest but in vain

suddenly the color fled the pulsation ceased the lips resumed the

expression of the dead and in an instant afterward the whole

body took upon itself the icy chilliness the livid hue the intense

rigidity the sunken outline and all the loathsome peculiarities of

that which has been for many days a tenant of the tomb



and again i sunk into visions of ligeia and again what marvel that i

shudder while i write again there reached my ears a low sob from the

region of the ebony bed but why shall i minutely detail the unspeakable

horrors of that night why shall i pause to relate how time after

time until near the period of the gray dawn this hideous drama of

revivification was repeated how each terrific relapse was only into a

sterner and apparently more irredeemable death how each agony wore the

aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe and how each struggle was

succeeded by i know not what of wild change in the personal appearance

of the corpse let me hurry to a conclusion



the greater part of the fearful night had worn away and she who had

been dead once again stirred and now more vigorously than hitherto

although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter

hopelessness than any i had long ceased to struggle or to move and

remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman a helpless prey to a whirl of

violent emotions of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible

the least consuming the corpse i repeat stirred and now more

vigorously than before the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy

into the countenance the limbs relaxed and save that the eyelids were

yet pressed heavily together and that the bandages and draperies of the

grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure i might

have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off utterly the fetters of

death but if this idea was not even then altogether adopted i could

at least doubt no longer when arising from the bed tottering with

feeble steps with closed eyes and with the manner of one bewildered in

a dream the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into

the middle of the apartment



i trembled not i stirred not for a crowd of unutterable fancies

connected with the air the stature the demeanor of the figure rushing

hurriedly through my brain had paralyzed had chilled me into stone i

stirred not but gazed upon the apparition there was a mad disorder

in my thoughts a tumult unappeasable could it indeed be the

living rowena who confronted me could it indeed be rowena at all the

fair-haired the blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine why why

should i doubt it the bandage lay heavily about the mouth but then

might it not be the mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine and the

cheeks-there were the roses as in her noon of life yes these might

indeed be the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine and the chin

with its dimples as in health might it not be hers but had she then

grown taller since her malady what inexpressible madness seized me with

that thought one bound and i had reached her feet shrinking from my

touch she let fall from her head unloosened the ghastly cerements

which had confined it and there streamed forth into the rushing

atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and dishevelled hair it

was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight and now slowly opened

the eyes of the figure which stood before me here then at least

i shrieked aloud can i never can i never be mistaken these are the

full and the black and the wild eyes of my lost love of the lady of

the lady ligeia





the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had

ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its

seal the redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and

sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with

dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the

face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid

and from the sympathy of his fellow-men and the whole seizure

progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an

hour



but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his

dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand

hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his

court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his

castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure

the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste a strong

and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the

courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and

welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor

egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the

abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might

bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of

itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the

prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were

buffoons there were improvisatori there were ballet-dancers there

were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and

security were within without was the red death



it was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion

and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince

prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most

unusual magnificence



it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of

the rooms in which it was held these were seven an imperial suite

in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista

while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand

so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the

case was very different as might have been expected from the duke's

love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that

the vision embraced but little more than one at a time there was a

sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel

effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and

narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued

the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose

colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations

of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was

hung for example in blue and vividly blue were its windows the

second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the

panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the

casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth

with white the sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely

shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and

down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same

material and hue but in this chamber only the colour of the windows

failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were

scarlet a deep blood colour now in no one of the seven apartments

was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden

ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof

there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the

suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there

stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of

fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly

illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and

fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect

of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the

blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a

look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of

the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all



it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western

wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a

dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minute-hand made the

circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from

the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep

and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that

at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were

constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to harken to

the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and

there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the

chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew

pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows

as if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully

ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians

looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and

folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next

chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and

then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand

and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another

chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and

tremulousness and meditation as before



but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the

tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colours and

effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were

bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there

are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he

was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure

that he was not



he had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven

chambers upon occasion of this great făşte and it was his own guiding

taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were

grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and

phantasm much of what has been since seen in hernani there were

arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were

delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there were much of the

beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the

terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust

to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of

dreams and these the dreams writhed in and about taking hue from

the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the

echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which

stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is

still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are

stiff-frozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die away they

have endured but an instant and a light half-subdued laughter floats

after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the

dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue

from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the

tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven

there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning

away and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes

and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot

falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a

muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears

who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments



but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat

feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until

at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and

then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the

waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things

as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell

of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought

crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among

those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the

last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were

many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of

the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no

single individual before and the rumour of this new presence having

spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole

company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and

surprise then finally of terror of horror and of disgust



in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be

supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation

in truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited but

the figure in question had out-heroded herod and gone beyond the

bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum there are chords in the

hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion

even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests

there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company

indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of

the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall

and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the

grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to

resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest

scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all

this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers

around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the

red death his vesture was dabbled in blood and his broad brow with

all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror



when the eyes of the prince prospero fell upon this spectral image

which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain

its role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be

convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror

or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage



who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near

him who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and

unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the

battlements



it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince

prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven

rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and

the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand



it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale

courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight

rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at

the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately

step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless

awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole

party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that

unimpeded he passed within a yard of the prince's person and while

the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of

the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the

same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the

first through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to

the green through the green to the orange through this again to the

white and even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been

made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero

maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice

rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on

account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a

drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three

or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained

the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted

his pursuer there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming

upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate

in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of

despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the

black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect

and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in

unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask

which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any

tangible form



and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come

like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the

blood-bedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing

posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with

that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired

and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over

all













﻿horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages why then give

a date to this story i have to tell let it suffice to say that at the

period of which i speak there existed in the interior of hungary a

settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the metempsychosis

of the doctrines themselves that is of their falsity or of their

probability i say nothing i assert however that much of our

incredulity as la bruyère says of all our unhappiness vient de ne

pouvoir être seuls 



but there are some points in the hungarian superstition which were fast

verging to absurdity they the hungarians differed very essentially

from their eastern authorities for example the soul said the

former i give the words of an acute and intelligent parisian ne

demeure qu'un seul fois dans un corps sensible au reste un cheval

un chien un homme même n'est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces

animaux



the families of berlifitzing and metzengerstein had been at variance

for centuries never before were two houses so illustrious mutually

embittered by hostility so deadly the origin of this enmity seems to

be found in the words of an ancient prophecy a lofty name shall have

a fearful fall when as the rider over his horse the mortality of

metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of berlifitzing



to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning but more

trivial causes have given rise and that no long while ago to

consequences equally eventful besides the estates which were

contiguous had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a

busy government moreover near neighbors are seldom friends and the

inhabitants of the castle berlifitzing might look from their lofty

buttresses into the very windows of the palace metzengerstein least of

all had the more than feudal magnificence thus discovered a tendency

to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy

berlifitzings what wonder then that the words however silly of that

prediction should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance

two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation

of hereditary jealousy the prophecy seemed to imply if it implied

anything a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful

house and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by

the weaker and less influential



wilhelm count berlifitzing although loftily descended was at the

epoch of this narrative an infirm and doting old man remarkable for

nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the

family of his rival and so passionate a love of horses and of hunting

that neither bodily infirmity great age nor mental incapacity

prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase



frederick baron metzengerstein was on the other hand not yet of age

his father the minister g died young his mother the lady mary

followed him quickly after frederick was at that time in his

fifteenth year in a city fifteen years are no long period a child

may be still a child in his third lustrum but in a wilderness in so

magnificent a wilderness as that old principality fifteen years have a

far deeper meaning



from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of

his father the young baron at the decease of the former entered

immediately upon his vast possessions such estates were seldom held

before by a nobleman of hungary his castles were without number the

chief in point of splendor and extent was the château metzengerstein

the boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined but his

principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles



upon the succession of a proprietor so young with a character so well

known to a fortune so unparalleled little speculation was afloat in

regard to his probable course of conduct and indeed for the space

of three days the behavior of the heir out-heroded herod and fairly

surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers shameful

debaucheries flagrant treacheries unheard-of atrocities gave his

trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on

their part no punctilios of conscience on his own were thenceforward

to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula

on the night of the fourth day the stables of the castle berlifitzing

were discovered to be on fire and the unanimous opinion of the

neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous

list of the baron's misdemeanors and enormities



but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence the young nobleman

himself sat apparently buried in meditation in a vast and desolate

upper apartment of the family palace of metzengerstein the rich

although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls

represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious

ancestors here rich-ermined priests and pontifical dignitaries

familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign put a veto on

the wishes of a temporal king or restrained with the fiat of papal

supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the arch-enemy there the dark

tall statures of the princes metzengerstein their muscular war-coursers

plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes startled the steadiest

nerves with their vigorous expression and here again the voluptuous

and swan-like figures of the dames of days gone by floated away in the

mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody



but as the baron listened or affected to listen to the gradually

increasing uproar in the stables of berlifitzing or perhaps pondered

upon some more novel some more decided act of audacity his eyes became

unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous and unnaturally

colored horse represented in the tapestry as belonging to a saracen

ancestor of the family of his rival the horse itself in the foreground

of the design stood motionless and statue-like while farther back its

discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein



on frederick's lip arose a fiendish expression as he became aware of

the direction which his glance had without his consciousness assumed

yet he did not remove it on the contrary he could by no means account

for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon

his senses it was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and

incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake the longer he

gazed the more absorbing became the spell the more impossible did it

appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of

that tapestry but the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent

with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of

ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the

apartment



the action however was but momentary his gaze returned mechanically

to the wall to his extreme horror and astonishment the head of the

gigantic steed had in the meantime altered its position the neck of

the animal before arched as if in compassion over the prostrate body

of its lord was now extended at full length in the direction of

the baron the eyes before invisible now wore an energetic and human

expression while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red and the

distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his

gigantic and disgusting teeth



stupified with terror the young nobleman tottered to the door as he

threw it open a flash of red light streaming far into the chamber

flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry

and he shuddered to perceive that shadow as he staggered awhile upon

the threshold assuming the exact position and precisely filling up

the contour of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the saracen

berlifitzing



to lighten the depression of his spirits the baron hurried into the

open air at the principal gate of the palace he encountered three

equerries with much difficulty and at the imminent peril of their

lives they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and

fiery-colored horse



whose horse where did you get him demanded the youth in a

querulous and husky tone of voice as he became instantly aware that the

mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of

the furious animal before his eyes



he is your own property sire replied one of the equerries at least

he is claimed by no other owner we caught him flying all smoking and

foaming with rage from the burning stables of the castle berlifitzing

supposing him to have belonged to the old count's stud of foreign

horses we led him back as an estray but the grooms there disclaim any

title to the creature which is strange since he bears evident marks of

having made a narrow escape from the flames



the letters w v b are also branded very distinctly on his forehead

interrupted a second equerry i supposed them of course to be the

initials of wilhelm von berlifitzing but all at the castle are positive

in denying any knowledge of the horse



extremely singular said the young baron with a musing air and

apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words he is as you say

a remarkable horse a prodigious horse although as you very justly

observe of a suspicious and untractable character let him be mine

however he added after a pause perhaps a rider like frederick

of metzengerstein may tame even the devil from the stables of

berlifitzing



you are mistaken my lord the horse as i think we mentioned is not

from the stables of the count if such had been the case we know our

duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your

family



true observed the baron dryly and at that instant a page of

the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color and a

precipitate step he whispered into his master's ear an account of the

sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry in an apartment

which he designated entering at the same time into particulars of a

minute and circumstantial character but from the low tone of voice in

which these latter were communicated nothing escaped to gratify the

excited curiosity of the equerries



the young frederick during the conference seemed agitated by a

variety of emotions he soon however recovered his composure and an

expression of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance as

he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately

locked up and the key placed in his own possession



have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter berlifitzing

said one of his vassals to the baron as after the departure of the

page the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own plunged

and curvetted with redoubled fury down the long avenue which extended

from the chateau to the stables of metzengerstein



no said the baron turning abruptly toward the speaker dead say

you



it is indeed true my lord and to a noble of your name will be i

imagine no unwelcome intelligence



a rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener how died he



in his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud

he has himself perished miserably in the flames



i-n-d-e-e-d- ejaculated the baron as if slowly and deliberately

impressed with the truth of some exciting idea



indeed repeated the vassal



shocking said the youth calmly and turned quietly into the chateau



from this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor

of the dissolute young baron frederick von metzengerstein indeed his

behavior disappointed every expectation and proved little in accordance

with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma while his habits and

manner still less than formerly offered any thing congenial with

those of the neighboring aristocracy he was never to be seen beyond

the limits of his own domain and in this wide and social world was

utterly companionless unless indeed that unnatural impetuous and

fiery-colored horse which he henceforward continually bestrode had any

mysterious right to the title of his friend



numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time

however periodically came in will the baron honor our festivals

with his presence will the baron join us in a hunting of the

boar metzengerstein does not hunt metzengerstein will not

attend were the haughty and laconic answers



these repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility

such invitations became less cordial less frequent in time they ceased

altogether the widow of the unfortunate count berlifitzing was even

heard to express a hope that the baron might be at home when he did not

wish to be at home since he disdained the company of his equals and

ride when he did not wish to ride since he preferred the society of a

horse this to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique

and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to

become when we desire to be unusually energetic



the charitable nevertheless attributed the alteration in the conduct

of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely

loss of his parents forgetting however his atrocious and reckless

behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that

bereavement some there were indeed who suggested a too haughty

idea of self-consequence and dignity others again among them may be

mentioned the family physician did not hesitate in speaking of morbid

melancholy and hereditary ill-health while dark hints of a more

equivocal nature were current among the multitude



indeed the baron's perverse attachment to his lately-acquired

charger an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every

fresh example of the animal's ferocious and demon-like propensities at

length became in the eyes of all reasonable men a hideous and

unnatural fervor in the glare of noon at the dead hour of night in

sickness or in health in calm or in tempest the young metzengerstein

seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse whose intractable

audacities so well accorded with his own spirit



there were circumstances moreover which coupled with late events gave

an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider and to

the capabilities of the steed the space passed over in a single leap

had been accurately measured and was found to exceed by an astounding

difference the wildest expectations of the most imaginative the baron

besides had no particular name for the animal although all the rest

in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations his

stable too was appointed at a distance from the rest and with regard

to grooming and other necessary offices none but the owner in person

had ventured to officiate or even to enter the enclosure of that

particular stall it was also to be observed that although the three

grooms who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration

at berlifitzing had succeeded in arresting his course by means of a

chain-bridle and noose yet no one of the three could with any certainty

affirm that he had during that dangerous struggle or at any period

thereafter actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast

instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and

high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting

unreasonable attention especially among men who daily trained to the

labors of the chase might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of

a horse but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves

per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic and it is said there

were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to

recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible

stamp times when the young metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away

from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking

eye



among all the retinue of the baron however none were found to doubt

the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of

the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse at least none

but an insignificant and misshapen little page whose deformities

were in everybody's way and whose opinions were of the least possible

importance he if his ideas are worth mentioning at all had the

effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle

without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder and that

upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride an

expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his

countenance



one tempestuous night metzengerstein awaking from a heavy slumber

descended like a maniac from his chamber and mounting in hot haste

bounded away into the mazes of the forest an occurrence so common

attracted no particular attention but his return was looked for with

intense anxiety on the part of his domestics when after some hours

absence the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the chateau

metzengerstein were discovered crackling and rocking to their

very foundation under the influence of a dense and livid mass of

ungovernable fire



as the flames when first seen had already made so terrible a progress

that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently

futile the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent

and pathetic wonder but a new and fearful object soon rivetted the

attention of the multitude and proved how much more intense is the

excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of

human agony than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of

inanimate matter



up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main

entrance of the château metzengerstein a steed bearing an unbonneted

and disordered rider was seen leaping with an impetuosity which

outstripped the very demon of the tempest



the career of the horseman was indisputably on his own part

uncontrollable the agony of his countenance the convulsive struggle

of his frame gave evidence of superhuman exertion but no sound save

a solitary shriek escaped from his lacerated lips which were bitten

through and through in the intensity of terror one instant and the

clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of

the flames and the shrieking of the winds another and clearing at a

single plunge the gate-way and the moat the steed bounded far up the

tottering staircases of the palace and with its rider disappeared

amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire



the fury of the tempest immediately died away and a dead calm sullenly

succeeded a white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud

and streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere shot forth a glare

of preternatural light while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the

battlements in the distinct colossal figure of a horse

﻿with a feeling of deep yet most singular affection i regarded my friend

morella thrown by accident into her society many years ago my soul

from our first meeting burned with fires it had never before known but

the fires were not of eros and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was

the gradual conviction that i could in no manner define their unusual

meaning or regulate their vague intensity yet we met and fate bound us

together at the altar and i never spoke of passion nor thought of

love she however shunned society and attaching herself to me alone

rendered me happy it is a happiness to wonder it is a happiness to

dream



morella's erudition was profound as i hope to live her talents were of

no common order her powers of mind were gigantic i felt this and in

many matters became her pupil i soon however found that perhaps

on account of her presburg education she placed before me a number of

those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of

the early german literature these for what reason i could not imagine

were her favourite and constant study and that in process of time

they became my own should be attributed to the simple but effectual

influence of habit and example



in all this if i err not my reason had little to do my convictions

or i forget myself were in no manner acted upon by the ideal nor was

any tincture of the mysticism which i read to be discovered unless i

am greatly mistaken either in my deeds or in my thoughts persuaded

of this i abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife and

entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies

and then then when poring over forbidden pages i felt a forbidden

spirit enkindling within me would morella place her cold hand upon my

own and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low singular

words whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory and

then hour after hour would i linger by her side and dwell upon the

music of her voice until at length its melody was tainted with terror

and there fell a shadow upon my soul and i grew pale and shuddered

inwardly at those too unearthly tones and thus joy suddenly faded into

horror and the most beautiful became the most hideous as hinnon became

ge-henna



it is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions

which growing out of the volumes i have mentioned formed for so

long a time almost the sole conversation of morella and myself by

the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be

readily conceived and by the unlearned they would at all events

be little understood the wild pantheism of fichte the modified

paliggenedia of the pythagoreans and above all the doctrines of

identity as urged by schelling were generally the points of discussion

presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative morella that identity

which is termed personal mr locke i think truly defines to consist

in the saneness of rational being and since by person we understand an

intelligent essence having reason and since there is a consciousness

which always accompanies thinking it is this which makes us all to

be that which we call ourselves thereby distinguishing us from

other beings that think and giving us our personal identity but the

principium indivduationis the notion of that identity which at death

is or is not lost for ever was to me at all times a consideration of

intense interest not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of

its consequences than from the marked and agitated manner in which

morella mentioned them



but indeed the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife's

manner oppressed me as a spell i could no longer bear the touch of her

wan fingers nor the low tone of her musical language nor the lustre

of her melancholy eyes and she knew all this but did not upbraid she

seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly and smiling called it

fate she seemed also conscious of a cause to me unknown for the

gradual alienation of my regard but she gave me no hint or token of

its nature yet was she woman and pined away daily in time the crimson

spot settled steadily upon the cheek and the blue veins upon the pale

forehead became prominent and one instant my nature melted into pity

but in next i met the glance of her meaning eyes and then my soul

sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward

into some dreary and unfathomable abyss



shall i then say that i longed with an earnest and consuming desire for

the moment of morella's decease i did but the fragile spirit clung to

its tenement of clay for many days for many weeks and irksome months

until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind and i grew

furious through delay and with the heart of a fiend cursed the days

and the hours and the bitter moments which seemed to lengthen and

lengthen as her gentle life declined like shadows in the dying of the

day



but one autumnal evening when the winds lay still in heaven morella

called me to her bedside there was a dim mist over all the earth and

a warm glow upon the waters and amid the rich october leaves of the

forest a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen



it is a day of days she said as i approached a day of all days

either to live or die it is a fair day for the sons of earth and

life ah more fair for the daughters of heaven and death



i kissed her forehead and she continued



i am dying yet shall i live



morella



the days have never been when thou couldst love me but her whom in

life thou didst abhor in death thou shalt adore



morella



i repeat i am dying but within me is a pledge of that affection ah

how little which thou didst feel for me morella and when my spirit

departs shall the child live thy child and mine morella's but thy

days shall be days of sorrow that sorrow which is the most lasting of

impressions as the cypress is the most enduring of trees for the hours

of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life as

the roses of paestum twice in a year thou shalt no longer then play

the teian with time but being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine

thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth as do the

moslemin at mecca



morella i cried morella how knowest thou this but she turned

away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs

she thus died and i heard her voice no more



yet as she had foretold her child to which in dying she had given

birth which breathed not until the mother breathed no more her child

a daughter lived and she grew strangely in stature and intellect and

was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed and i loved her

with a love more fervent than i had believed it possible to feel for any

denizen of earth



but ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened and

gloom and horror and grief swept over it in clouds i said the child

grew strangely in stature and intelligence strange indeed was her

rapid increase in bodily size but terrible oh terrible were the

tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development

of her mental being could it be otherwise when i daily discovered

in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the

woman when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy and

when the wisdom or the passions of maturity i found hourly gleaming from

its full and speculative eye when i say all this became evident to my

appalled senses when i could no longer hide it from my soul nor throw

it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it is it to be

wondered at that suspicions of a nature fearful and exciting crept in

upon my spirit or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales

and thrilling theories of the entombed morella i snatched from the

scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore and

in the rigorous seclusion of my home watched with an agonizing anxiety

over all which concerned the beloved



and as years rolled away and i gazed day after day upon her holy and

mild and eloquent face and poured over her maturing form day after

day did i discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother

the melancholy and the dead and hourly grew darker these shadows of

similitude and more full and more definite and more perplexing and

more hideously terrible in their aspect for that her smile was like her

mother's i could bear but then i shuddered at its too perfect identity

that her eyes were like morella's i could endure but then they too

often looked down into the depths of my soul with morella's own intense

and bewildering meaning and in the contour of the high forehead and

in the ringlets of the silken hair and in the wan fingers which buried

themselves therein and in the sad musical tones of her speech and

above all oh above all in the phrases and expressions of the dead on

the lips of the loved and the living i found food for consuming thought

and horror for a worm that would not die



thus passed away two lustra of her life and as yet my daughter

remained nameless upon the earth my child and my love were the

designations usually prompted by a father's affection and the rigid

seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse morella's name

died with her at her death of the mother i had never spoken to the

daughter it was impossible to speak indeed during the brief period of

her existence the latter had received no impressions from the outward

world save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her

privacy but at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind

in its unnerved and agitated condition a present deliverance from the

terrors of my destiny and at the baptismal font i hesitated for a name

and many titles of the wise and beautiful of old and modern times of

my own and foreign lands came thronging to my lips with many many

fair titles of the gentle and the happy and the good what prompted

me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead what demon urged me to

breathe that sound which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb

the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart what fiend

spoke from the recesses of my soul when amid those dim aisles and in

the silence of the night i whispered within the ears of the holy man

the syllables morella what more than fiend convulsed the features of

my child and overspread them with hues of death as starting at that

scarcely audible sound she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to

heaven and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault

responded i am here



distinct coldly calmly distinct fell those few simple sounds within

my ear and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain

years years may pass away but the memory of that epoch never nor was

i indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine but the hemlock and the

cypress overshadowed me night and day and i kept no reckoning of time

or place and the stars of my fate faded from heaven and therefore the

earth grew dark and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows

and among them all i beheld only morella the winds of the firmament

breathed but one sound within my ears and the ripples upon the sea

murmured evermore morella but she died and with my own hands i bore

her to the tomb and i laughed with a long and bitter laugh as i found

no traces of the first in the channel where i laid the second morella

﻿





once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary

over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping

as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door

t is some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door 

 only this and nothing more



ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december

and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor

eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow

from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost lenore 

for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore 

 nameless here for evermore



and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain

thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before

so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating

t is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door

some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door 

 this it is and nothing more



presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer

sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore

but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping

and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door

that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door 

 darkness there and nothing more



deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing

doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before

but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token

and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore

this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore

 merely this and nothing more



back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning

soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before

surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice

let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore 

let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore 

 t is the wind and nothing more



open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter

in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore

not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he

but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door 

perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door 

 perched and sat and nothing more



then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling

by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore

though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven

ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore 

tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore

 quoth the raven nevermore



much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly

though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore

for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being

ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door 

bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door

 with such name as nevermore



but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only

that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour

nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered 

till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before 

on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before

 then the bird said nevermore



startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken

doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store

caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster

followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore 

till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore

 of never nevermore



but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling

straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door

then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking

fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore 

what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore

 meant in croaking nevermore



this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing

to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core

this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining

on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er

but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er

 she shall press ah nevermore



then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer

swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor

wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee

respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore

quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore

 quoth the raven nevermore



prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil 

whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore

desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted 

on this home by horror haunted tell me truly i implore 

is there is there balm in gilead tell me tell me i implore

 quoth the raven nevermore



prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil

by that heaven that bends above us by that god we both adore 

tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn

it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore 

clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore

 quoth the raven nevermore



be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting 

get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore

leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken

leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door

take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door

 quoth the raven nevermore



and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting

on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door

and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming

and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor

and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor

 shall be lifted nevermore



﻿ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall have long

since gone my way into the region of shadows for indeed strange things

shall happen and secret things be known and many centuries shall pass

away ere these memorials be seen of men and when seen there will be

some to disbelieve and some to doubt and yet a few who will find much

to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron



the year had been a year of terror and of feelings more intense than

terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many prodigies and

signs had taken place and far and wide over sea and land the black

wings of the pestilence were spread abroad to those nevertheless

cunning in the stars it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect

of ill and to me the greek oinos among others it was evident that

now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth

year when at the entrance of aries the planet jupiter is conjoined

with the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the

skies if i mistake not greatly made itself manifest not only in

the physical orb of the earth but in the souls imaginations and

meditations of mankind



over some flasks of the red chian wine within the walls of a noble

hall in a dim city called ptolemais we sat at night a company of

seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of

brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos and being of

rare workmanship was fastened from within black draperies likewise

in the gloomy room shut out from our view the moon the lurid stars

and the peopleless streets but the boding and the memory of evil they

would not be so excluded there were things around us and about of

which i can render no distinct account things material

and spiritual heaviness in the atmosphere a sense of

suffocation anxiety and above all that terrible state of existence

which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and

awake and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant a dead weight

hung upon us it hung upon our limbs upon the household furniture upon

the goblets from which we drank and all things were depressed and

borne down thereby all things save only the flames of the seven lamps

which illumined our revel uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of

light they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless and in the

mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at

which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his

own countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his

companions yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way which was

hysterical and sang the songs of anacreon which are madness and drank

deeply although the purple wine reminded us of blood for there was yet

another tenant of our chamber in the person of young zoilus dead

and at full length he lay enshrouded the genius and the demon of the

scene alas he bore no portion in our mirth save that his countenance

distorted with the plague and his eyes in which death had but half

extinguished the fire of the pestilence seemed to take such interest in

our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who

are to die but although i oinos felt that the eyes of the departed

were upon me still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of

their expression and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony

mirror sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of

teios but gradually my songs they ceased and their echoes rolling

afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber became weak and

undistinguishable and so faded away and lo from among those sable

draperies where the sounds of the song departed there came forth a dark

and undefined shadow a shadow such as the moon when low in heaven

might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow neither

of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and quivering awhile among

the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the

surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague and formless

and indefinite and was the shadow neither of man nor of god neither

god of greece nor god of chaldaea nor any egyptian god and the shadow

rested upon the brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of

the door and moved not nor spoke any word but there became stationary

and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested was if i

remember aright over against the feet of the young zoilus enshrouded

but we the seven there assembled having seen the shadow as it came out

from among the draperies dared not steadily behold it but cast down

our eyes and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony

and at length i oinos speaking some low words demanded of the shadow

its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered i am shadow

and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais and hard by those

dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul charonian canal

and then did we the seven start from our seats in horror and stand

trembling and shuddering and aghast for the tones in the voice of

the shadow were not the tones of any one being but of a multitude of

beings and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell

duskly upon our ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many

thousand departed friends


 kind solace in a dying hour
 such father is not now my theme 
 i will not madly deem that power
 of earth may shrive me of the sin
 unearthly pride hath revelled in 
 i have no time to dote or dream
 you call it hope that fire of fire
 it is but agony of desire
 if i can hope o god i can 
 its fount is holier more divine 
 i would not call thee fool old man
 but such is not a gift of thine

 know thou the secret of a spirit
 bowed from its wild pride into shame
 o yearning heart i did inherit
 thy withering portion with the fame
 the searing glory which hath shone
 amid the jewels of my throne
 halo of hell and with a pain
 not hell shall make me fear again 
 o craving heart for the lost flowers
 and sunshine of my summer hours
 the undying voice of that dead time
 with its interminable chime
 rings in the spirit of a spell
 upon thy emptiness a knell

 i have not always been as now
 the fevered diadem on my brow
 i claimed and won usurpingly 
 hath not the same fierce heirdom given
 rome to the căśsar this to me
 the heritage of a kingly mind
 and a proud spirit which hath striven
 triumphantly with human kind
 on mountain soil i first drew life
 the mists of the taglay have shed
 nightly their dews upon my head
 and i believe the winged strife
 and tumult of the headlong air
 have nestled in my very hair

 so late from heaven that dew it fell
 mid dreams of an unholy night
 upon me with the touch of hell
 while the red flashing of the light
 from clouds that hung like banners o'er
 appeared to my half-closing eye
 the pageantry of monarchy
 and the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
 came hurriedly upon me telling
 of human battle where my voice
 my own voice silly child was swelling
 o how my spirit would rejoice
 and leap within me at the cry
 the battle-cry of victory

 the rain came down upon my head
 unsheltered and the heavy wind
 rendered me mad and deaf and blind
 it was but man i thought who shed
 laurels upon me and the rush 
 the torrent of the chilly air
 gurgled within my ear the crush
 of empires with the captive's prayer 
 the hum of suitors and the tone
 of flattery round a sovereign's throne

 my passions from that hapless hour
 usurped a tyranny which men
 have deemed since i have reached to power
 my innate nature be it so
 but father there lived one who then
 then in my boyhood when their fire
 burned with a still intenser glow
 for passion must with youth expire
 e'en then who knew this iron heart
 in woman's weakness had a part

 i have no words alas to tell
 the loveliness of loving well
 nor would i now attempt to trace
 the more than beauty of a face
 whose lineaments upon my mind
 are shadows on th unstable wind
 thus i remember having dwelt
 some page of early lore upon
 with loitering eye till i have felt
 the letters with their meaning melt
 to fantasies with none

 o she was worthy of all love
 love as in infancy was mine 
 twas such as angel minds above
 might envy her young heart the shrine
 on which my every hope and thought
 were incense then a goodly gift
 for they were childish and upright 
 pure as her young example taught
 why did i leave it and adrift
 trust to the fire within for light

 we grew in age and love together 
 roaming the forest and the wild
 my breast her shield in wintry weather 
 and when the friendly sunshine smiled
 and she would mark the opening skies
 i saw no heaven but in her eyes
 young love's first lesson is the heart
 for mid that sunshine and those smiles
 when from our little cares apart
 and laughing at her girlish wiles
 i'd throw me on her throbbing breast
 and pour my spirit out in tears 
 there was no need to speak the rest 
 no need to quiet any fears
 of her who asked no reason why
 but turned on me her quiet eye

 yet more than worthy of the love
 my spirit struggled with and strove
 when on the mountain peak alone
 ambition lent it a new tone 
 i had no being but in thee
 the world and all it did contain
 in the earth the air the sea 
 its joy its little lot of pain
 that was new pleasure the ideal
 dim vanities of dreams by night 
 and dimmer nothings which were real 
 shadows and a more shadowy light
 parted upon their misty wings
 and so confusedly became
 thine image and a name a name
 two separate yet most intimate things

 i was ambitious have you known
 the passion father you have not
 a cottager i marked a throne
 of half the world as all my own
 and murmured at such lowly lot 
 but just like any other dream
 upon the vapor of the dew
 my own had past did not the beam
 of beauty which did while it thro
 the minute the hour the day oppress
 my mind with double loveliness

 we walked together on the crown
 of a high mountain which looked down
 afar from its proud natural towers
 of rock and forest on the hills 
 the dwindled hills begirt with bowers
 and shouting with a thousand rills

 i spoke to her of power and pride
 but mystically in such guise
 that she might deem it nought beside
 the moment's converse in her eyes
 i read perhaps too carelessly 
 a mingled feeling with my own 
 the flush on her bright cheek to me
 seemed to become a queenly throne
 too well that i should let it be
 light in the wilderness alone

 i wrapped myself in grandeur then
 and donned a visionary crown 
 yet it was not that fantasy
 had thrown her mantle over me 
 but that among the rabble men
 lion ambition is chained down 
 and crouches to a keeper's hand 
 not so in deserts where the grand 
 the wild the terrible conspire
 with their own breath to fan his fire

 look round thee now on samarcand 
 is she not queen of earth her pride
 above all cities in her hand
 their destinies in all beside
 of glory which the world hath known
 stands she not nobly and alone
 falling her veriest stepping-stone
 shall form the pedestal of a throne 
 and who her sovereign timour he
 whom the astonished people saw
 striding o'er empires haughtily
 a diademed outlaw

 o human love thou spirit given
 on earth of all we hope in heaven
 which fall'st into the soul like rain
 upon the siroc-withered plain
 and failing in thy power to bless
 but leav'st the heart a wilderness
 idea which bindest life around
 with music of so strange a sound
 and beauty of so wild a birth 
 farewell for i have won the earth

 when hope the eagle that towered could see
 no cliff beyond him in the sky
 his pinions were bent droopingly 
 and homeward turned his softened eye
 twas sunset when the sun will part
 there comes a sullenness of heart
 to him who still would look upon
 the glory of the summer sun
 that soul will hate the ev'ning mist
 so often lovely and will list
 to the sound of the coming darkness known
 to those whose spirits hearken as one
 who in a dream of night would fly
 but cannot from a danger nigh

 what tho the moon tho the white moon
 shed all the splendor of her noon
 her smile is chilly and her beam
 in that time of dreariness will seem
 so like you gather in your breath
 a portrait taken after death
 and boyhood is a summer sun
 whose waning is the dreariest one 
 for all we live to know is known
 and all we seek to keep hath flown 
 let life then as the day-flower fall
 with the noon-day beauty which is all
 i reached my home my home no more 
 for all had flown who made it so
 i passed from out its mossy door
 and tho my tread was soft and low
 a voice came from the threshold stone
 of one whom i had earlier known 
 o i defy thee hell to show
 on beds of fire that burn below
 an humbler heart a deeper woe

 father i firmly do believe 
 i know for death who comes for me
 from regions of the blest afar
 where there is nothing to deceive
 hath left his iron gate ajar
 and rays of truth you cannot see
 are flashing thro eternity 
 i do believe that eblis hath
 a snare in every human path 
 else how when in the holy grove
 i wandered of the idol love 
 who daily scents his snowy wings
 with incense of burnt-offerings
 from the most unpolluted things
 whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
 above with trellised rays from heaven
 no mote may shun no tiniest fly 
 the light'ning of his eagle eye 
 how was it that ambition crept
 unseen amid the revels there
 till growing bold he laughed and leapt
 in the tangles of love's very hair
﻿it was well said of a certain german book that er lasst sich nicht

lesen it does not permit itself to be read there are some secrets

which do not permit themselves to be told men die nightly in their

beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them

piteously in the eyes die with despair of heart and convulsion of

throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer

themselves to be revealed now and then alas the conscience of man

takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only

into the grave and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged



not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn i sat at the

large bow window of the d - coffee-house in london for some months

i had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with returning

strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so

precisely the converse of ennui moods of the keenest appetency when

the film from the mental vision departs the greek phrase and the

intellect electrified surpasses as greatly its every-day condition

as does the vivid yet candid reason of leibnitz the mad and flimsy

rhetoric of gorgias merely to breathe was enjoyment and i derived

positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain i

felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing with a cigar in

my mouth and a newspaper in my lap i had been amusing myself for the

greater part of the afternoon now in poring over advertisements now

in observing the promiscuous company in the room and now in peering

through the smoky panes into the street



this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had

been very much crowded during the whole day but as the darkness came

on the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well

lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past

the door at this particular period of the evening i had never before

been in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads

filled me therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion i gave up

at length all care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in

contemplation of the scene without



at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn

i looked at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their

aggregate relations soon however i descended to details and regarded

with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air

gait visage and expression of countenance



by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied

business-like demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their

way through the press their brows were knit and their eyes rolled

quickly when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom

of impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on others still

a numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces

and talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude

on account of the very denseness of the company around when impeded in

their progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but re-doubled

their gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile

upon the lips the course of the persons impeding them if jostled

they bowed profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with

confusion there was nothing very distinctive about these two large

classes beyond what i have noted their habiliments belonged to that

order which is pointedly termed the decent they were undoubtedly

noblemen merchants attorneys tradesmen stock-jobbers the eupatrids

and the common-places of society men of leisure and men actively

engaged in affairs of their own conducting business upon their own

responsibility they did not greatly excite my attention



the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned

two remarkable divisions there were the junior clerks of flash

houses young gentlemen with tight coats bright boots well-oiled hair

and supercilious lips setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage

which may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of

these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the

perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before they wore

the cast-off graces of the gentry and this i believe involves the

best definition of the class



the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady

old fellows it was not possible to mistake these were known by their

coats and pantaloons of black or brown made to sit comfortably with

white cravats and waistcoats broad solid-looking shoes and thick hose

or gaiters they had all slightly bald heads from which the right

ears long used to pen-holding had an odd habit of standing off on

end i observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both

hands and wore watches with short gold chains of a substantial and

ancient pattern theirs was the affectation of respectability if

indeed there be an affectation so honorable



there were many individuals of dashing appearance whom i easily

understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which

all great cities are infested i watched these gentry with much

inquisitiveness and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever

be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves their voluminousness

of wristband with an air of excessive frankness should betray them at

once



the gamblers of whom i descried not a few were still more easily

recognisable they wore every variety of dress from that of the

desperate thimble-rig bully with velvet waistcoat fancy neckerchief

gilt chains and filagreed buttons to that of the scrupulously inornate

clergyman than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion still

all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion a

filmy dimness of eye and pallor and compression of lip there were two

other traits moreover by which i could always detect them a guarded

lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of

the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers very often

in company with these sharpers i observed an order of men somewhat

different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather they may be

defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits they seem to prey

upon the public in two battalions that of the dandies and that of the

military men of the first grade the leading features are long locks and

smiles of the second frogged coats and frowns



descending in the scale of what is termed gentility i found darker

and deeper themes for speculation i saw jew pedlars with hawk eyes

flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an

expression of abject humility sturdy professional street beggars

scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp whom despair alone had

driven forth into the night for charity feeble and ghastly invalids

upon whom death had placed a sure hand and who sidled and tottered

through the mob looking every one beseechingly in the face as if in

search of some chance consolation some lost hope modest young girls

returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home and shrinking

more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians whose

direct contact even could not be avoided women of the town of all

kinds and of all ages the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her

womanhood putting one in mind of the statue in lucian with the surface

of parian marble and the interior filled with filth the loathsome and

utterly lost leper in rags the wrinkled bejewelled and paint-begrimed

beldame making a last effort at youth the mere child of immature form

yet from long association an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her

trade and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her

elders in vice drunkards innumerable and indescribable some in shreds

and patches reeling inarticulate with bruised visage and lack-lustre

eyes some in whole although filthy garments with a slightly unsteady

swagger thick sensual lips and hearty-looking rubicund faces others

clothed in materials which had once been good and which even now were

scrupulously well brushed men who walked with a more than naturally

firm and springy step but whose countenances were fearfully pale whose

eyes hideously wild and red and who clutched with quivering fingers as

they strode through the crowd at every object which came within

their reach beside these pie-men porters coal heavers sweeps

organ-grinders monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers those who vended

with those who sang ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every

description and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which

jarred discordantly upon the ear and gave an aching sensation to the

eye



as the night deepened so deepened to me the interest of the scene for

not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter its

gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly

portion of the people and its harsher ones coming out into bolder

relief as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its

den but the rays of the gas-lamps feeble at first in their struggle

with the dying day had now at length gained ascendancy and threw over

every thing a fitful and garish lustre all was dark yet splendid as

that ebony to which has been likened the style of tertullian



the wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of

individual faces and although the rapidity with which the world of

light flitted before the window prevented me from casting more than

a glance upon each visage still it seemed that in my then peculiar

mental state i could frequently read even in that brief interval of a

glance the history of long years



with my brow to the glass i was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob

when suddenly there came into view a countenance that of a decrepid old

man some sixty-five or seventy years of age a countenance which

at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention on account of the

absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression any thing even remotely

resembling that expression i had never seen before i well remember that

my first thought upon beholding it was that retzch had he viewed it

would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the

fiend as i endeavored during the brief minute of my original survey

to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed there arose confusedly

and paradoxically within my mind the ideas of vast mental power of

caution of penuriousness of avarice of coolness of malice of

blood thirstiness of triumph of merriment of excessive terror

of intense of supreme despair i felt singularly aroused startled

fascinated how wild a history i said to myself is written within

that bosom then came a craving desire to keep the man in view to know

more of him hurriedly putting on an overcoat and seizing my hat and

cane i made my way into the street and pushed through the crowd in

the direction which i had seen him take for he had already disappeared

with some little difficulty i at length came within sight of him

approached and followed him closely yet cautiously so as not to

attract his attention



i had now a good opportunity of examining his person he was short in

stature very thin and apparently very feeble his clothes generally

were filthy and ragged but as he came now and then within the strong

glare of a lamp i perceived that his linen although dirty was of

beautiful texture and my vision deceived me or through a rent in a

closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped

him i caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger these

observations heightened my curiosity and i resolved to follow the

stranger whithersoever he should go



it was now fully night-fall and a thick humid fog hung over the city

soon ending in a settled and heavy rain this change of weather had an

odd effect upon the crowd the whole of which was at once put into new

commotion and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas the waver the

jostle and the hum increased in a tenfold degree for my own part i

did not much regard the rain the lurking of an old fever in my system

rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant tying a

handkerchief about my mouth i kept on for half an hour the old man

held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare and i here

walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him never

once turning his head to look back he did not observe me by and bye he

passed into a cross street which although densely filled with people

was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted here a

change in his demeanor became evident he walked more slowly and with

less object than before more hesitatingly he crossed and re-crossed

the way repeatedly without apparent aim and the press was still so

thick that at every such movement i was obliged to follow him closely

the street was a narrow and long one and his course lay within it for

nearly an hour during which the passengers had gradually diminished to

about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in broadway near the

park so vast a difference is there between a london populace and that

of the most frequented american city a second turn brought us into a

square brilliantly lighted and overflowing with life the old manner

of the stranger re-appeared his chin fell upon his breast while his

eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows in every direction upon

those who hemmed him in he urged his way steadily and perseveringly i

was surprised however to find upon his having made the circuit of

the square that he turned and retraced his steps still more was i

astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times once nearly

detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement



in this exercise he spent another hour at the end of which we met with

far less interruption from passengers than at first the rain fell fast

the air grew cool and the people were retiring to their homes with

a gesture of impatience the wanderer passed into a bye-street

comparatively deserted down this some quarter of a mile long he

rushed with an activity i could not have dreamed of seeing in one so

aged and which put me to much trouble in pursuit a few minutes brought

us to a large and busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger

appeared well acquainted and where his original demeanor again became

apparent as he forced his way to and fro without aim among the host

of buyers and sellers



during the hour and a half or thereabouts which we passed in this

place it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach

without attracting his observation luckily i wore a pair of caoutchouc

over-shoes and could move about in perfect silence at no moment did

he see that i watched him he entered shop after shop priced nothing

spoke no word and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare

i was now utterly amazed at his behavior and firmly resolved that we

should not part until i had satisfied myself in some measure respecting

him



a loud-toned clock struck eleven and the company were fast deserting

the bazaar a shop-keeper in putting up a shutter jostled the old

man and at the instant i saw a strong shudder come over his frame he

hurried into the street looked anxiously around him for an instant and

then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less

lanes until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we

had started the street of the d hotel it no longer wore however

the same aspect it was still brilliant with gas but the rain fell

fiercely and there were few persons to be seen the stranger grew pale

he walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue then with a

heavy sigh turned in the direction of the river and plunging through

a great variety of devious ways came out at length in view of one of

the principal theatres it was about being closed and the audience were

thronging from the doors i saw the old man gasp as if for breath while

he threw himself amid the crowd but i thought that the intense agony of

his countenance had in some measure abated his head again fell upon

his breast he appeared as i had seen him at first i observed that

he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the

audience but upon the whole i was at a loss to comprehend the

waywardness of his actions



as he proceeded the company grew more scattered and his old uneasiness

and vacillation were resumed for some time he followed closely a

party of some ten or twelve roisterers but from this number one by one

dropped off until three only remained together in a narrow and gloomy

lane little frequented the stranger paused and for a moment seemed

lost in thought then with every mark of agitation pursued rapidly

a route which brought us to the verge of the city amid regions very

different from those we had hitherto traversed it was the most noisome

quarter of london where every thing wore the worst impress of the most

deplorable poverty and of the most desperate crime by the dim light

of an accidental lamp tall antique worm-eaten wooden tenements were

seen tottering to their fall in directions so many and capricious that

scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them

the paving-stones lay at random displaced from their beds by the

rankly-growing grass horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters

the whole atmosphere teemed with desolation yet as we proceeded the

sounds of human life revived by sure degrees and at length large bands

of the most abandoned of a london populace were seen reeling to and fro

the spirits of the old man again flickered up as a lamp which is near

its death hour once more he strode onward with elastic tread suddenly

a corner was turned a blaze of light burst upon our sight and we stood

before one of the huge suburban temples of intemperance one of the

palaces of the fiend gin



it was now nearly day-break but a number of wretched inebriates still

pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance with a half shriek of

joy the old man forced a passage within resumed at once his original

bearing and stalked backward and forward without apparent object

among the throng he had not been thus long occupied however before

a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the

night it was something even more intense than despair that i then

observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom i had watched

so pertinaciously yet he did not hesitate in his career but with

a mad energy retraced his steps at once to the heart of the mighty

london long and swiftly he fled while i followed him in the wildest

amazement resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which i now felt an

interest all-absorbing the sun arose while we proceeded and when we

had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town the

street of the d - hotel it presented an appearance of human bustle

and activity scarcely inferior to what i had seen on the evening before

and here long amid the momently increasing confusion did i persist

in my pursuit of the stranger but as usual he walked to and fro and

during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street and

as the shades of the second evening came on i grew wearied unto death

and stopping fully in front of the wanderer gazed at him steadfastly

in the face he noticed me not but resumed his solemn walk while i

ceasing to follow remained absorbed in contemplation this old man i

said at length is the type and the genius of deep crime he refuses to

be alone page he is the man of the crowd it will be in vain to

follow for i shall learn no more of him nor of his deeds the worst

heart of the world is a grosser book than the hortulus animæ and

perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of god that er lasst sich

﻿ whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism

its startling facts are now almost universally admitted of these

latter those who doubt are your mere doubters by profession an

unprofitable and disreputable tribe there can be no more absolute waste

of time than the attempt to prove at the present day that man by

mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an

abnormal condition of which the phenomena resemble very closely those

of death or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the

phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance that

while in this state the person so impressed employs only with effort

and then feebly the external organs of sense yet perceives with

keenly refined perception and through channels supposed unknown

matters beyond the scope of the physical organs that moreover his

intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated that his

sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound and finally

that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency

while in the same proportion the peculiar phenomena elicited are more

extended and more pronounced



 i say that these which are the laws of mesmerism in its

general features it would be supererogation to demonstrate nor shall i

inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration to-day my purpose

at present is a very different one indeed i am impelled even in

the teeth of a world of prejudice to detail without comment the very

remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between a sleep-waker and

myself



 i had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in

question mr vankirk and the usual acute susceptibility and

exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened for many months he

had been laboring under confirmed phthisis the more distressing effects

of which had been relieved by my manipulations and on the night of

wednesday the fifteenth instant i was summoned to his bedside



 the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the

heart and breathed with great difficulty having all the ordinary

symptoms of asthma in spasms such as these he had usually found relief

from the application of mustard to the nervous centres but to-night

this had been attempted in vain



 as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile and

although evidently in much bodily pain appeared to be mentally quite

at ease



 i sent for you to-night he said not so much to administer

to my bodily ailment as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal

impressions which of late have occasioned me much anxiety and

surprise i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the

topic of the soul's immortality i cannot deny that there has always

existed as if in that very soul which i have been denying a vague

half-sentiment of its own existence but this half-sentiment at no

time amounted to conviction with it my reason had nothing to do

all attempts at logical inquiry resulted indeed in leaving me more

sceptical than before i had been advised to study cousin i studied

him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american

echoes the charles elwood of mr brownson for example was placed

in my hands i read it with profound attention throughout i found it

logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily

the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book in his

summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even

succeeded in convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his

beginning like the government of trinculo in short i was not long in

perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own

immortality he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions

which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england of

france and of germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take no

hold on the mind here upon earth at least philosophy i am persuaded

will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things the

will may assent the soul the intellect never



 i repeat then that i only half felt and never intellectually

believed but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the

feeling until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of

reason that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two i am

enabled too plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence

i cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the

mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination

which in my abnormal existence convinces but which in full

accordance with the mesmeric phenomena does not extend except through

its effect into my normal condition in sleep-waking the reasoning

and its conclusion the cause and its effect are present together in

my natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and perhaps only

partially remains



 these considerations have led me to think that some good

results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions

propounded to me while mesmerized you have often observed the profound

self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker the extensive knowledge he

displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself and

from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of

a catechism



 i consented of course to make this experiment a few passes

threw mr vankirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became

immediately more easy and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness

the following conversation then ensued v in the dialogue representing

the patient and p myself



 p are you asleep



 v yes no i would rather sleep more soundly



p after a few more passes do you sleep now



v yes



p how do you think your present illness will result



v after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort i must

die



p does the idea of death afflict you



v very quickly no no



p are you pleased with the prospect



v if i were awake i should like to die but now it is no matter the

mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me



p i wish you would explain yourself mr vankirk



v i am willing to do so but it requires more effort than i feel able

to make you do not question me properly



p what then shall i ask



v you must begin at the beginning



p the beginning but where is the beginning



v you know that the beginning is god this was said in a low

fluctuating tone and with every sign of the most profound veneration



p what then is god



v hesitating for many minutes i cannot tell



p is not god spirit



v while i was awake i knew what you meant by spirit but now it

seems only a word such for instance as truth beauty a quality i

mean



p is not god immaterial



v there is no immateriality it is a mere word that which is not

matter is not at all unless qualities are things



p is god then material



v no this reply startled me very much



p what then is he



v after a long pause and mutteringly i see but it is a thing

difficult to tell another long pause he is not spirit for

he exists nor is he matter as you understand it but there are

gradations of matter of which man knows nothing the grosser impelling

the finer the finer pervading the grosser the atmosphere for example

impels the electric principle while the electric principle permeates

the atmosphere these gradations of matter increase in rarity

or fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticled without

particles indivisible one and here the law of impulsion and

permeation is modified the ultimate or unparticled matter not only

permeates all things but impels all things and thus is all things

within itself this matter is god what men attempt to embody in the

word thought is this matter in motion



p the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion

and thinking and that the latter is the origin of the former



v yes and i now see the confusion of idea motion is the action

of mind not of thinking the unparticled matter or god in

quiescence is as nearly as we can conceive it what men call mind and

the power of self-movement equivalent in effect to human volition is

in the unparticled matter the result of its unity and omniprevalence

how i know not and now clearly see that i shall never know but the

unparticled matter set in motion by a law or quality existing within

itself is thinking



p can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the

unparticled matter



v the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in

gradation we have for example a metal a piece of wood a drop of

water the atmosphere a gas caloric electricity the luminiferous

ether now we call all these things matter and embrace all matter in

one general definition but in spite of this there can be no two ideas

more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal and that

which we attach to the luminiferous ether when we reach the latter we

feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit or with

nihility the only consideration which restrains us is our conception

of its atomic constitution and here even we have to seek aid from

our notion of an atom as something possessing in infinite minuteness

solidity palpability weight destroy the idea of the atomic

constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an

entity or at least as matter for want of a better word we might term

it spirit take now a step beyond the luminiferous ether conceive a

matter as much more rare than the ether as this ether is more rare than

the metal and we arrive at once in spite of all the school dogmas at

a unique mass an unparticled matter for although we may admit infinite

littleness in the atoms themselves the infinitude of littleness in the

spaces between them is an absurdity there will be a point there will

be a degree of rarity at which if the atoms are sufficiently numerous

the interspaces must vanish and the mass absolutely coalesce but

the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away the

nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit it

is clear however that it is as fully matter as before the truth is

it is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to

imagine what is not when we flatter ourselves that we have formed

its conception we have merely deceived our understanding by the

consideration of infinitely rarified matter



p there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea

of absolute coalescence and that is the very slight resistance

experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space a

resistance now ascertained it is true to exist in some degree but

which is nevertheless so slight as to have been quite overlooked by

the sagacity even of newton we know that the resistance of bodies

is chiefly in proportion to their density absolute coalescence

is absolute density where there are no interspaces there can be no

yielding an ether absolutely dense would put an infinitely more

effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant

or of iron



v your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the

ratio of its apparent unanswerability as regards the progress of the

star it can make no difference whether the star passes through the

ether or the ether through it there is no astronomical error more

unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the

comets with the idea of their passage through an ether for however

rare this ether be supposed it would put a stop to all sidereal

revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those

astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found

it impossible to comprehend the retardation actually experienced is on

the other hand about that which might be expected from the friction

of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb in the one

case the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself in

the other it is endlessly accumulative



p but in all this in this identification of mere matter with god is

there nothing of irreverence i was forced to repeat this question

before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning



v can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind but

you forget that the matter of which i speak is in all respects the

very mind or spirit of the schools so far as regards its high

capacities and is moreover the matter of these schools at the

same time god with all the powers attributed to spirit is but the

perfection of matter



p you assert then that the unparticled matter in motion is

thought



v in general this motion is the universal thought of the universal

mind this thought creates all created things are but the thoughts of

god



p you say in general



v yes the universal mind is god for new individualities matter

is necessary



p but you now speak of mind and matter as do the metaphysicians



v yes to avoid confusion when i say mind i mean the unparticled

or ultimate matter by matter i intend all else



p you were saying that for new individualities matter is necessary



v yes for mind existing unincorporate is merely god to create

individual thinking beings it was necessary to incarnate portions

of the divine mind thus man is individualized divested of corporate

investiture he were god now the particular motion of the incarnated

portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man as the motion

of the whole is that of god



p you say that divested of the body man will be god



v after much hesitation i could not have said this it is an

absurdity



p referring to my notes you did say that divested of

corporate investiture man were god



v and this is true man thus divested would be god would be

unindividualized but he can never be thus divested at least never

will be else we must imagine an action of god returning upon

itself a purposeless and futile action man is a creature creatures

are thoughts of god it is the nature of thought to be irrevocable



p i do not comprehend you say that man will never put off the body



v i say that he will never be bodiless



p explain



v there are two bodies the rudimental and the complete

corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly

what we call death is but the painful metamorphosis our present

incarnation is progressive preparatory temporary our future is

perfected ultimate immortal the ultimate life is the full design



p but of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant



v we certainly but not the worm the matter of which our

rudimental body is composed is within the ken of the organs of that

body or more distinctly our rudimental organs are adapted to the

matter of which is formed the rudimental body but not to that of which

the ultimate is composed the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental

senses and we perceive only the shell which falls in decaying from

the inner form not that inner form itself but this inner form as

well as the shell is appreciable by those who have already acquired the

ultimate life



p you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles

death how is this



v when i say that it resembles death i mean that it resembles the

ultimate life for when i am entranced the senses of my rudimental

life are in abeyance and i perceive external things directly

without organs through a medium which i shall employ in the ultimate

unorganized life



p unorganized



v yes organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought

into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter to

the exclusion of other classes and forms the organs of man are adapted

to his rudimental condition and to that only his ultimate condition

being unorganized is of unlimited comprehension in all points but

one the nature of the volition of god that is to say the motion of

the unparticled matter you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate

body by conceiving it to be entire brain this it is not but a

conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it

is a luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether

the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina these again

communicate similar ones to the optic nerve the nerve conveys similar

ones to the brain the brain also similar ones to the unparticled

matter which permeates it the motion of this latter is thought of

which perception is the first undulation this is the mode by which the

mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world and

this external world is to the rudimental life limited through the

idiosyncrasy of its organs but in the ultimate unorganized life the

external world reaches the whole body which is of a substance having

affinity to brain as i have said with no other intervention than that

of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous and to this

ether in unison with it the whole body vibrates setting in motion

the unparticled matter which permeates it it is to the absence of

idiosyncratic organs therefore that we must attribute the nearly

unlimited perception of the ultimate life to rudimental beings organs

are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged



p you speak of rudimental beings are there other rudimental

thinking beings than man



v the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ

planets suns and other bodies which are neither nebulæ suns

nor planets is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the

idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings but for

the necessity of the rudimental prior to the ultimate life there

would have been no bodies such as these each of these is tenanted by a

distinct variety of organic rudimental thinking creatures in all

the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted at death

or metamorphosis these creatures enjoying the ultimate

life immortality and cognizant of all secrets but the one act all

things and pass everywhere by mere volition indwelling not the stars

which to us seem the sole palpabilities and for the accommodation

of which we blindly deem space created but that space itself that

infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the

star-shadows blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of

the angels



p you say that but for the necessity of the rudimental life there

would have been no stars but why this necessity



v in the inorganic life as well as in the inorganic matter

generally there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique

law the divine volition with the view of producing impediment the

organic life and matter complex substantial and law-encumbered

were contrived



p but again why need this impediment have been produced



v the result of law inviolate is perfection right negative

happiness the result of law violate is imperfection wrong positive

pain through the impediments afforded by the number complexity and

substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter the violation of

law is rendered to a certain extent practicable thus pain which in

the inorganic life is impossible is possible in the organic



p but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible



v all things are either good or bad by comparison a sufficient

analysis will show that pleasure in all cases is but the contrast of

pain positive pleasure is a mere idea to be happy at any one point

we must have suffered at the same never to suffer would have been never

to have been blessed but it has been shown that in the inorganic

life pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic the pain of the

primitive life of earth is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate

life in heaven



p still there is one of your expressions which i find it impossible

to comprehend the truly substantive vastness of infinity



v this probably is because you have no sufficiently generic

conception of the term substance itself we must not regard it as a

quality but as a sentiment it is the perception in thinking beings

of the adaptation of matter to their organization there are many things

on the earth which would be nihility to the inhabitants of venus many

things visible and tangible in venus which we could not be brought

to appreciate as existing at all but to the inorganic beings to the

angels the whole of the unparticled matter is substance that is

to say the whole of what we term space is to them the truest

substantiality the stars meantime through what we consider their

materiality escaping the angelic sense just in proportion as the

unparticled matter through what we consider its immateriality eludes

the organic



 as the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words in a feeble tone

i observed on his countenance a singular expression which somewhat

alarmed me and induced me to awake him at once no sooner had i done

this than with a bright smile irradiating all his features he fell

back upon his pillow and expired i noticed that in less than a minute

afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone his brow was

of the coldness of ice thus ordinarily should it have appeared only

after long pressure from azrael's hand had the sleep-waker indeed

during the latter portion of his discourse been addressing me from out

the region of the shadows

﻿the chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance

rather than permit me in my desperately wounded condition to pass a

night in the open air was one of those piles of commingled gloom and

grandeur which have so long frowned among the appennines not less in

fact than in the fancy of mrs radcliffe to all appearance it had been

temporarily and very lately abandoned we established ourselves in one

of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments it lay in a

remote turret of the building its decorations were rich yet tattered

and antique its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with

manifold and multiform armorial trophies together with an unusually

great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden

arabesque in these paintings which depended from the walls not only

in their main surfaces but in very many nooks which the bizarre

architecture of the chateau rendered necessary in these paintings my

incipient delirium perhaps had caused me to take deep interest so

that i bade pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room since it was

already night to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by

the head of my bed and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains

of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself i wished all this done

that i might resign myself if not to sleep at least alternately to the

contemplation of these pictures and the perusal of a small volume which

had been found upon the pillow and which purported to criticise and

describe them



long long i read and devoutly devotedly i gazed rapidly and

gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came the position of

the candelabrum displeased me and outreaching my hand with difficulty

rather than disturb my slumbering valet i placed it so as to throw its

rays more fully upon the book



but the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated the rays of

the numerous candles for there were many now fell within a niche of

the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the

bed-posts i thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before it

was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood i glanced

at the painting hurriedly and then closed my eyes why i did this

was not at first apparent even to my own perception but while my lids

remained thus shut i ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting

them it was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought to make

sure that my vision had not deceived me to calm and subdue my fancy for

a more sober and more certain gaze in a very few moments i again looked

fixedly at the painting



that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt for the first

flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the

dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses and to startle me at

once into waking life



the portrait i have already said was that of a young girl it was a

mere head and shoulders done in what is technically termed a vignette

manner much in the style of the favorite heads of sully the arms the

bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into

the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole the

frame was oval richly gilded and filigreed in moresque as a thing of

art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself but it

could have been neither the execution of the work nor the immortal

beauty of the countenance which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved

me least of all could it have been that my fancy shaken from its half

slumber had mistaken the head for that of a living person i saw at

once that the peculiarities of the design of the vignetting and of the

frame must have instantly dispelled such idea must have prevented even

its momentary entertainment thinking earnestly upon these points i

remained for an hour perhaps half sitting half reclining with my

vision riveted upon the portrait at length satisfied with the true

secret of its effect i fell back within the bed i had found the spell

of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression which at

first startling finally confounded subdued and appalled me with deep

and reverent awe i replaced the candelabrum in its former position the

cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view i sought eagerly

the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories turning

to the number which designated the oval portrait i there read the vague

and quaint words which follow



she was a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full of

glee and evil was the hour when she saw and loved and wedded the

painter he passionate studious austere and having already a bride

in his art she a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full

of glee all light and smiles and frolicsome as the young fawn loving

and cherishing all things hating only the art which was her rival

dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments

which deprived her of the countenance of her lover it was thus a

terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to

portray even his young bride but she was humble and obedient and sat

meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber where the light

dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead but he the painter

took glory in his work which went on from hour to hour and from day to

day and he was a passionate and wild and moody man who became lost

in reveries so that he would not see that the light which fell so

ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his

bride who pined visibly to all but him yet she smiled on and still on

uncomplainingly because she saw that the painter who had high renown

took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task and wrought day and

night to depict her who so loved him yet who grew daily more dispirited

and weak and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its

resemblance in low words as of a mighty marvel and a proof not less of

the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted

so surpassingly well but at length as the labor drew nearer to its

conclusion there were admitted none into the turret for the painter

had grown wild with the ardor of his work and turned his eyes from

canvas merely even to regard the countenance of his wife and he would

not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from

the cheeks of her who sate beside him and when many weeks had passed

and but little remained to do save one brush upon the mouth and one

tint upon the eye the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the

flame within the socket of the lamp and then the brush was given

and then the tint was placed and for one moment the painter stood

entranced before the work which he had wrought but in the next while

he yet gazed he grew tremulous and very pallid and aghast and crying

with a loud voice this is indeed life itself turned suddenly to

regard his beloved she was dead



﻿during the dread reign of the cholera in new york i had accepted the

invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement

of his cottage ornee on the banks of the hudson we had here around

us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling

in the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books

we should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful

intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city

not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some

acquaintance then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily

the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every

messenger the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death

that palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul i

could neither speak think nor dream of any thing else my host was

of a less excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in

spirits exerted himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical

intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities to the substances

of terror he was sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no

apprehension



his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into

which i had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain

volumes which i had found in his library these were of a character to

force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition

lay latent in my bosom i had been reading these books without his

knowledge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible

impressions which had been made upon my fancy



a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens a belief

which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed

to defend on this subject we had long and animated discussions he

maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters i

contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-

that is to say without apparent traces of suggestion had in itself the

unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to as much respect

as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of

genius



the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had

occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had

in it so much of the portentous character that i might well have been

excused for regarding it as an omen it appalled and at the same time

so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could

make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend



near the close of exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at

an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a

view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been

denuded by what is termed a land-slide of the principal portion of its

trees my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to

the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city uplifting my eyes

from the page they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an

object upon some living monster of hideous conformation which very

rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally

in the dense forest below as this creature first came in sight i

doubted my own sanity or at least the evidence of my own eyes and

many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was

neither mad nor in a dream yet when i described the monster which

i distinctly saw and calmly surveyed through the whole period of

its progress my readers i fear will feel more difficulty in being

convinced of these points than even i did myself



estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of

the large trees near which it passed the few giants of the forest which

had escaped the fury of the land-slide i concluded it to be far larger

than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line because

the shape of the monster suggested the idea the hull of one of our

seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general

outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a

proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as

the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was

an immense quantity of black shaggy hair more than could have been

supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this

hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike

those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions extending

forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a

gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure

crystal and in shape a perfect prism it reflected in the most gorgeous

manner the rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a

wedge with the apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs

of wings each wing nearly one hundred yards in length one pair being

placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each

scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that

the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but

the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a

death's head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and

which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of

the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while

i regarded the terrific animal and more especially the appearance

on its breast with a feeling or horror and awe with a sentiment of

forthcoming evil which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of

the reason i perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis

suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so

loud and so expressive of wo that it struck upon my nerves like a knell

and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once

fainting to the floor



upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend

of what i had seen and heard and i can scarcely explain what feeling of

repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me



at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we

were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparition i

occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa

near at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to

give him an account of the phenomenon he heard me to the end at first

laughed heartily and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as

if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again

had a distinct view of the monster to which with a shout of absolute

terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerly but maintained

that he saw nothing although i designated minutely the course of the

creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill



i was now immeasurably alarmed for i considered the vision either as an

omen of my death or worse as the fore-runner of an attack of mania i

threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried

my face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no

longer apparent



my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his

demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the

conformation of the visionary creature when i had fully satisfied

him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable

burden and went on to talk with what i thought a cruel calmness of

various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed

subject of discussion between us i remember his insisting very

especially among other things upon the idea that the principle

source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of

the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an

object through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity to estimate

properly for example he said the influence to be exercised on

mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of democracy the distance

of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should

not fail to form an item in the estimate yet can you tell me one writer

on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch

of the subject worthy of discussion at all



he here paused for a moment stepped to a book-case and brought forth

one of the ordinary synopses of natural history requesting me then to

exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine

print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the

book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before



but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the

monster i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you

what it was in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy

account of the genus sphinx of the family crepuscularia of the order

lepidoptera of the class of insecta or insects the account runs thus



four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic

appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation

of the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of

mandibles and downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior

by a stiff hair antennae in the form of an elongated club prismatic

abdomen pointed the death's headed sphinx has occasioned much terror

among the vulgar at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it

utters and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet



he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing

himself accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of

beholding the monster



ah here it is he presently exclaimed it is reascending the face

of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be

still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it for

the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some

spider has wrought along the window-sash i find it to be about the

sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth

of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye

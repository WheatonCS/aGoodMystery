# step 3: Classification (aGoodMystery)

First a small test. Shuffle our "whole pot" of texts and apply Delta.
More specifically, one sample text segment from each author was tested against a
Delta model built from the remaining texts.

In the next step, we show a script that automates the construction of the
primary_set (training set) and second_set (test set). Here, we slow it down
a bit and just perform one trial.

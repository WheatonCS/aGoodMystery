reader on the shores
of the holy lake when last seen the environs of the works were
filled with violence and uproar they were now possessed by stillness
and death the blood-stained conquerors had departed and their camp
which had so lately rung with the merry rejoicings of a victorious army
lay a silent and deserted city of huts the fortress was a smoldering
ruin charred rafters fragments of exploded artillery and rent
mason-work covering its earthen mounds in confused disorder

a frightful change had also occurred in the season the sun had hid
its warmth behind an impenetrable mass of vapor and hundreds of human
forms which had blackened beneath the fierce heats of august were
stiffening in their deformity before the blasts of a premature november
the curling and spotless mists which had been seen sailing above the
hills toward the north were now returning in an interminable dusky
sheet that was urged along by the fury of a tempest the crowded mirror
of the horican was gone and in its place the green and angry waters
lashed the shores as if indignantly casting back its impurities to
the polluted strand still the clear fountain retained a portion of its
charmed influence but it reflected only the somber gloom that fell
from the impending heavens that humid and congenial atmosphere which
commonly adorned the view veiling its harshness and softening its
asperities had disappeared the northern air poured across the waste of
water so harsh and unmingled that nothing was left to be conjectured by
the eye or fashioned by the fancy

the fiercer element had cropped the verdure of the plain which looked
as though it were scathed by the consuming lightning but here and
there a dark green tuft rose in the midst of the desolation the
earliest fruits of a soil that had been fattened with human blood
the whole landscape which seen by a favoring light and in a genial
temperature had been found so lovely appeared now like some pictured
allegory of life in which objects were arrayed in their harshest but
truest colors and without the relief of any shadowing

the solitary and arid blades of grass arose from the passing gusts
fearfully perceptible the bold and rocky mountains were too distinct in
their barrenness and the eye even sought relief in vain by attempting
to pierce the illimitable void of heaven which was shut to its gaze by
the dusky sheet of ragged and driving vapor

the wind blew unequally sometimes sweeping heavily along the ground
seeming to whisper its moanings in the cold ears of the dead then
rising in a shrill and mournful whistling it entered the forest with
a rush that filled the air with the leaves and branches it scattered in
its path amid the unnatural shower a few hungry ravens struggled with
the gale but no sooner was the green ocean of woods which stretched
beneath them passed than they gladly stopped at random to their
hideous banquet

in short it was a scene of wildness and desolation and it appeared as
if all who had profanely entered it had been stricken at a blow by
the relentless arm of death but the prohibition had ceased and for the
first time since the perpetrators of those foul deeds which had assisted
to disfigure the scene were gone living human beings had now presumed
to approach the place

about an hour before the setting of the sun on the day already
mentioned the forms of five men might have been seen issuing from the
narrow vista of trees where the path to the hudson entered the forest
and advancing in the direction of the ruined works at first their
progress was slow and guarded as though they entered with reluctance
amid the horrors of the post or dreaded the renewal of its frightful
incidents a light figure preceded the rest of the party with
the caution and activity of a native ascending every hillock to
reconnoiter and indicating by gestures to his companions the route he
deemed it most prudent to pursue nor were those in the rear wanting in
every caution and foresight known to forest warfare one among them he
also was an indian moved a little on one flank and watched the margin
of the woods with eyes long accustomed to read the smallest sign
of danger the remaining three were white though clad in vestments
adapted both in quality and color to their present hazardous
pursuit that of hanging on the skirts of a retiring army in the
wilderness

the effects produced by the appalling sights that constantly arose in
their path to the lake shore were as different as the characters of the
respective individuals who composed the party the youth in front
threw serious but furtive glances at the mangled victims as he stepped
lightly across the plain afraid to exhibit his feelings and yet too
inexperienced to quell entirely their sudden and powerful influence his
red associate however was superior to such a weakness he passed the
groups of dead with a steadiness of purpose and an eye so calm that
nothing but long and inveterate practise could enable him to maintain
the sensations produced in the minds of even the white men were
different though uniformly sorrowful one whose gray locks and
furrowed lineaments blending with a martial air and tread betrayed in
spite of the disguise of a woodsman's dress a man long experienced in
scenes of war was not ashamed to groan aloud whenever a spectacle of
more than usual horror came under his view the young man at his elbow
shuddered but seemed to suppress his feelings in tenderness to his
companion of them all the straggler who brought up the rear appeared
alone to betray his real thoughts without fear of observation or dread
of consequences he gazed at the most appalling sight with eyes and
muscles that knew not how to waver but with execrations so bitter and
deep as to denote how much he denounced the crime of his enemies

the reader will perceive at once in these respective characters the
mohicans and their white friend the scout together with munro and
heyward it was in truth the father in quest of his children attended
by the youth who felt so deep a stake in their happiness and those
brave and trusty foresters who had already proved their skill and
fidelity through the trying scenes related

when uncas who moved in front had reached the center of the plain he
raised a cry that drew his companions in a body to the spot the young
warrior had halted over a group of females who lay in a cluster a
confused mass of dead notwithstanding the revolting horror of
the exhibition munro and heyward flew toward the festering heap
endeavoring with a love that no unseemliness could extinguish to
discover whether any vestiges of those they sought were to be seen among
the tattered and many-colored garments the father and the lover
found instant relief in the search though each was condemned again
to experience the misery of an uncertainty that was hardly less
insupportable than the most revolting truth they were standing silent
and thoughtful around the melancholy pile when the scout approached
eyeing the sad spectacle with an angry countenance the sturdy woodsman
for the first time since his entering the plain spoke intelligibly and
aloud

i have been on many a shocking field and have followed a trail of
blood for weary miles he said but never have i found the hand of the
devil so plain as it is here to be seen revenge is an indian feeling
and all who know me know that there is no cross in my veins but this
much will i say here in the face of heaven and with the power of the
lord so manifest in this howling wilderness that should these frenchers
ever trust themselves again within the range of a ragged bullet there
is one rifle which shall play its part so long as flint will fire or
powder burn i leave the tomahawk and knife to such as have a natural
gift to use them what say you chingachgook he added in delaware
shall the hurons boast of this to their women when the deep snows
come

a gleam of resentment flashed across the dark lineaments of the mohican
chief he loosened his knife in his sheath and then turning calmly from
the sight his countenance settled into a repose as deep as if he knew
the instigation of passion

montcalm montcalm continued the deeply resentful and less
self-restrained scout they say a time must come when all the deeds
done in the flesh will be seen at a single look and that by eyes
cleared from mortal infirmities woe betide the wretch who is born to
behold this plain with the judgment hanging about his soul ha as i
am a man of white blood yonder lies a red-skin without the hair of
his head where nature rooted it look to him delaware it may be one of
your missing people and he should have burial like a stout warrior
i see it in your eye sagamore a huron pays for this afore the fall
winds have blown away the scent of the blood

chingachgook approached the mutilated form and turning it over he
found the distinguishing marks of one of those six allied tribes or
nations as they were called who while they fought in the english
ranks were so deadly hostile to his own people spurning the loathsome
object with his foot he turned from it with the same indifference he
would have quitted a brute carcass the scout comprehended the action
and very deliberately pursued his own way continuing however his
denunciations against the french commander in the same resentful strain

nothing but vast wisdom and unlimited power should dare to sweep off
men in multitudes he added for it is only the one that can know the
necessity of the judgment and what is there short of the other that
can replace the creatures of the lord i hold it a sin to kill the
second buck afore the first is eaten unless a march in front or
an ambushment be contemplated it is a different matter with a few
warriors in open and rugged fight for tis their gift to die with the
rifle or the tomahawk in hand according as their natures may happen to
be white or red uncas come this way lad and let the ravens settle
upon the mingo i know from often seeing it that they have a craving
for the flesh of an oneida and it is as well to let the bird follow the
gift of its natural appetite

hugh exclaimed the young mohican rising on the extremities of his
feet and gazing intently in his front frightening the ravens to some
other prey by the sound and the action

what is it boy whispered the scout lowering his tall form into a
crouching attitude like a panther about to take his leap god send it
be a tardy frencher skulking for plunder i do believe killdeer would
take an uncommon range today

uncas without making any reply bounded away from the spot and in the
next instant he was seen tearing from a bush and waving in triumph a
fragment of the green riding-veil of cora the movement the exhibition
and the cry which again burst from the lips of the young mohican
instantly drew the whole party about him

my child said munro speaking quickly and wildly give me my child

uncas will try was the short and touching answer

the simple but meaning assurance was lost on the father who seized
the piece of gauze and crushed it in his hand while his eyes roamed
fearfully among the bushes as if he equally dreaded and hoped for the
secrets they might reveal

here are no dead said heyward the storm seems not to have passed
this way

that's manifest and clearer than the heavens above our heads
returned the undisturbed scout but either she or they that have
robbed her have passed the bush for i remember the rag she wore to
hide a face that all did love to look upon uncas you are right the
dark-hair has been here and she has fled like a frightened fawn to the
wood none who could fly would remain to be murdered let us search
for the marks she left for to indian eyes i sometimes think a
humming-bird leaves his trail in the air

the young mohican darted away at the suggestion and the scout had
hardly done speaking before the former raised a cry of success from the
margin of the forest on reaching the spot the anxious party perceived
another portion of the veil fluttering on the lower branch of a beech

softly softly said the scout extending his long rifle in front of
the eager heyward we now know our work but the beauty of the trail
must not be deformed a step too soon may give us hours of trouble we
have them though that much is beyond denial

bless ye bless ye worthy man exclaimed munro whither then have
they fled and where are my babes

the path they have taken depends on many chances if they have gone
alone they are quite as likely to move in a circle as straight and
they may be within a dozen miles of us but if the hurons or any of the
french indians have laid hands on them tis probably they are now
near the borders of the canadas but what matters that continued the
deliberate scout observing the powerful anxiety and disappointment
the listeners exhibited here are the mohicans and i on one end of
the trail and rely on it we find the other though they should be a
hundred leagues asunder gently gently uncas you are as impatient
as a man in the settlements you forget that light feet leave but faint
marks

hugh exclaimed chingachgook who had been occupied in examining an
opening that had been evidently made through the low underbrush which
skirted the forest and who now stood erect as he pointed downward in
the attitude and with the air of a man who beheld a disgusting serpent

here is the palpable impression of the footstep of a man cried
heyward bending over the indicated spot he has trod in the margin of
this pool and the mark cannot be mistaken they are captives

better so than left to starve in the wilderness returned the scout
and they will leave a wider trail i would wager fifty beaver skins
against as many flints that the mohicans and i enter their wigwams
within the month stoop to it uncas and try what you can make of the
moccasin for moccasin it plainly is and no shoe

the young mohican bent over the track and removing the scattered leaves
from around the place he examined it with much of that sort of scrutiny
that a money dealer in these days of pecuniary doubts would bestow on
a suspected due-bill at length he arose from his knees satisfied with
the result of the examination

well boy demanded the attentive scout what does it say can you
make anything of the tell-tale

le renard subtil

ha that rampaging devil again there will never be an end of his
loping till killdeer has said a friendly word to him

heyward reluctantly admitted the truth of this intelligence and now
expressed rather his hopes than his doubts by saying

one moccasin is so much like another it is probable there is some
mistake

one moccasin like another you may as well say that one foot is like
another though we all know that some are long and others short some
broad and others narrow some with high and some with low insteps some
intoed and some out one moccasin is no more like another than one book
is like another though they who can read in one are seldom able to tell
the marks of the other which is all ordered for the best giving to
every man his natural advantages let me get down to it uncas neither
book nor moccasin is the worse for having two opinions instead of one
the scout stooped to the task and instantly added

you are right boy here is the patch we saw so often in the other
chase and the fellow will drink when he can get an opportunity your
drinking indian always learns to walk with a wider toe than the natural
savage it being the gift of a drunkard to straddle whether of white or
red skin tis just the length and breadth too look at it sagamore
you measured the prints more than once when we hunted the varmints from
glenn's to the health springs

chingachgook complied and after finishing his short examination he
arose and with a quiet demeanor he merely pronounced the word

magua

ay tis a settled thing here then have passed the dark-hair and
magua

and not alice demanded heyward

of her we have not yet seen the signs returned the scout looking
closely around at the trees the bushes and the ground what have
we there uncas bring hither the thing you see dangling from yonder
thorn-bush

when the indian had complied the scout received the prize and holding
it on high he laughed in his silent but heartfelt manner

tis the tooting we'pon of the singer now we shall have a trail a
priest might travel he said uncas look for the marks of a shoe that
is long enough to uphold six feet two of tottering human flesh i begin
to have some hopes of the fellow since he has given up squalling to
follow some better trade

at least he has been faithful to his trust said heyward and cora
and alice are not without a friend

yes said hawkeye dropping his rifle and leaning on it with an air
of visible contempt he will do their singing can he slay a buck for
their dinner journey by the moss on the beeches or cut the throat of
a huron if not the first catbird he meets is the cleverer of the two
well boy any signs of such a foundation

 the powers of the american mocking-bird are generally
 known but the true mocking-bird is not found so far north
 as the state of new york where it has however two
 substitutes of inferior excellence the catbird so often
 named by the scout and the bird vulgarly called ground-
 thresher either of these last two birds is superior to the
 nightingale or the lark though in general the american
 birds are less musical than those of europe

here is something like the footstep of one who has worn a shoe can it
be that of our friend

touch the leaves lightly or you'll disconsart the formation that that
is the print of a foot but tis the dark-hair's and small it is too
for one of such a noble height and grand appearance the singer would
cover it with his heel

where let me look on the footsteps of my child said munro shoving
the bushes aside and bending fondly over the nearly obliterated
impression though the tread which had left the mark had been light and
rapid it was still plainly visible the aged soldier examined it with
eyes that grew dim as he gazed nor did he rise from this stooping
posture until heyward saw that he had watered the trace of his
daughter's passage with a scalding tear willing to divert a distress
which threatened each moment to break through the restraint of
appearances by giving the veteran something to do the young man said
to the scout

as we now possess these infallible signs let us commence our march a
moment at such a time will appear an age to the captives

it is not the swiftest leaping deer that gives the longest chase
returned hawkeye without moving his eyes from the different marks that
had come under his view we know that the rampaging huron has passed
and the dark-hair and the singer but where is she of the yellow locks
and blue eyes though little and far from being as bold as her sister
she is fair to the view and pleasant in discourse has she no friend
that none care for her

god forbid she should ever want hundreds are we not now in her
pursuit for one i will never cease the search till she be found

in that case we may have to journey by different paths for here she
has not passed light and little as her footsteps would be

heyward drew back all his ardor to proceed seeming to vanish on the
instant without attending to this sudden change in the other's humor
the scout after musing a moment continued

there is no woman in this wilderness could leave such a print as that
but the dark-hair or her sister we know that the first has been here
but where are the signs of the other let us push deeper on the trail
and if nothing offers we must go back to the plain and strike another
scent move on uncas and keep your eyes on the dried leaves i will
watch the bushes while your father shall run with a low nose to the
ground move on friends the sun is getting behind the hills

is there nothing that i can do demanded the anxious heyward

you repeated the scout who with his red friends was already
advancing in the order he had prescribed yes you can keep in our rear
and be careful not to cross the trail

before they had proceeded many rods the indians stopped and appeared
to gaze at some signs on the earth with more than their usual keenness
both father and son spoke quick and loud now looking at the object
of their mutual admiration and now regarding each other with the most
unequivocal pleasure

they have found the little foot exclaimed the scout moving forward
without attending further to his own portion of the duty what have
we here an ambushment has been planted in the spot no by the truest
rifle on the frontiers here have been them one-sided horses again now
the whole secret is out and all is plain as the north star at midnight
yes here they have mounted there the beasts have been bound to a
sapling in waiting and yonder runs the broad path away to the north
in full sweep for the canadas

but still there are no signs of alice of the younger miss munro said
duncan

unless the shining bauble uncas has just lifted from the ground should
prove one pass it this way lad that we may look at it

heyward instantly knew it for a trinket that alice was fond of wearing
and which he recollected with the tenacious memory of a lover to have
seen on the fatal morning of the massacre dangling from the fair neck
of his mistress he seized the highly prized jewel and as he proclaimed
the fact it vanished from the eyes of the wondering scout who in vain
looked for it on the ground long after it was warmly pressed against
the beating heart of duncan

pshaw said the disappointed hawkeye ceasing to rake the leaves with
the breech of his rifle tis a certain sign of age when the sight
begins to weaken such a glittering gewgaw and not to be seen well
well i can squint along a clouded barrel yet and that is enough to
settle all disputes between me and the mingoes i should like to find
the thing too if it were only to carry it to the right owner and that
would be bringing the two ends of what i call a long trail together
for by this time the broad st lawrence or perhaps the great lakes
themselves are between us

so much the more reason why we should not delay our march returned
heyward let us proceed

young blood and hot blood they say are much the same thing we are
not about to start on a squirrel hunt or to drive a deer into the
horican but to outlie for days and nights and to stretch across
a wilderness where the feet of men seldom go and where no bookish
knowledge would carry you through harmless an indian never starts on
such an expedition without smoking over his council-fire and though
a man of white blood i honor their customs in this particular seeing
that they are deliberate and wise we will therefore go back and
light our fire to-night in the ruins of the old fort and in the morning
we shall be fresh and ready to undertake our work like men and not
like babbling women or eager boys

heyward saw by the manner of the scout that altercation would be
useless munro had again sunk into that sort of apathy which had beset
him since his late overwhelming misfortunes and from which he was
apparently to be roused only by some new and powerful excitement making
a merit of necessity the young man took the veteran by the arm and
followed in the footsteps of the indians and the scout who had already
begun to retrace the path which conducted them to the plain




chapter 

 salar why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
 his flesh what's that good for
 shy to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it
 will feed my revenge
 merchant of venice

the shades of evening had come to increase the dreariness of the place
when the party entered the ruins of william henry the scout and his
companions immediately made their preparations to pass the night there
but with an earnestness and sobriety of demeanor that betrayed how
much the unusual horrors they had just witnessed worked on even their
practised feelings a few fragments of rafters were reared against a
blackened wall and when uncas had covered them slightly with brush
the temporary accommodations were deemed sufficient the young indian
pointed toward his rude hut when his labor was ended and heyward who
understood the meaning of the silent gestures gently urged munro to
enter leaving the bereaved old man alone with his sorrows duncan
immediately returned into the open air too much excited himself to seek
the repose he had recommended to his veteran friend

while hawkeye and the indians lighted their fire and took their
evening's repast a frugal meal of dried bear's meat the young man paid
a visit to that curtain of the dilapidated fort which looked out on the
sheet of the horican the wind had fallen and the waves were already
rolling on the sandy beach beneath him in a more regular and tempered
succession the clouds as if tired of their furious chase were
breaking asunder the heavier volumes gathering in black masses about
the horizon while the lighter scud still hurried above the water or
eddied among the tops of the mountains like broken flights of birds
hovering around their roosts here and there a red and fiery star
struggled through the drifting vapor furnishing a lurid gleam of
brightness to the dull aspect of the heavens within the bosom of the
encircling hills an impenetrable darkness had already settled and
the plain lay like a vast and deserted charnel-house without omen or
whisper to disturb the slumbers of its numerous and hapless tenants

of this scene so chillingly in accordance with the past duncan stood
for many minutes a rapt observer his eyes wandered from the bosom of
the mound where the foresters were seated around their glimmering fire
to the fainter light which still lingered in the skies and then rested
long and anxiously on the embodied gloom which lay like a dreary
void on that side of him where the dead reposed he soon fancied that
inexplicable sounds arose from the place though so indistinct and
stolen as to render not only their nature but even their existence
uncertain ashamed of his apprehensions the young man turned toward the
water and strove to divert his attention to the mimic stars that dimly
glimmered on its moving surface still his too-conscious ears performed
their ungrateful duty as if to warn him of some lurking danger at
length a swift trampling seemed quite audibly to rush athwart the
darkness unable any longer to quiet his uneasiness duncan spoke in a
low voice to the scout requesting him to ascend the mound to the place
where he stood hawkeye threw his rifle across an arm and complied but
with an air so unmoved and calm as to prove how much he counted on the
security of their position

listen said duncan when the other placed himself deliberately at his
elbow there are suppressed noises on the plain which may show montcalm
has not yet entirely deserted his conquest

then ears are better than eyes said the undisturbed scout who
having just deposited a portion of a bear between his grinders spoke
thick and slow like one whose mouth was doubly occupied i myself saw
him caged in ty with all his host for your frenchers when they
have done a clever thing like to get back and have a dance or a
merry-making with the women over their success

i know not an indian seldom sleeps in war and plunder may keep a
huron here after his tribe has departed it would be well to extinguish
the fire and have a watch listen you hear the noise i mean

an indian more rarely lurks about the graves though ready to slay and
not over regardful of the means he is commonly content with the scalp
unless when blood is hot and temper up but after spirit is once fairly
gone he forgets his enmity and is willing to let the dead find their
natural rest speaking of spirits major are you of opinion that the
heaven of a red-skin and of us whites will be of one and the same

no doubt no doubt i thought i heard it again or was it the rustling
of the leaves in the top of the beech

for my own part continued hawkeye turning his face for a moment
in the direction indicated by heyward but with a vacant and careless
manner i believe that paradise is ordained for happiness and that
men will be indulged in it according to their dispositions and gifts
i therefore judge that a red-skin is not far from the truth when
he believes he is to find them glorious hunting grounds of which his
traditions tell nor for that matter do i think it would be any
disparagement to a man without a cross to pass his time 

you hear it again interrupted duncan

ay ay when food is scarce and when food is plenty a wolf grows
bold said the unmoved scout there would be picking too among the
skins of the devils if there was light and time for the sport but
concerning the life that is to come major i have heard preachers say
in the settlements that heaven was a place of rest now men's minds
differ as to their ideas of enjoyment for myself and i say it with
reverence to the ordering of providence it would be no great indulgence
to be kept shut up in those mansions of which they preach having a
natural longing for motion and the chase

duncan who was now made to understand the nature of the noise he had
heard answered with more attention to the subject which the humor of
the scout had chosen for discussion by saying

it is difficult to account for the feelings that may attend the last
great change

it would be a change indeed for a man who has passed his days in
the open air returned the single-minded scout and who has so often
broken his fast on the head waters of the hudson to sleep within sound
of the roaring mohawk but it is a comfort to know we serve a merciful
master though we do it each after his fashion and with great tracts of
wilderness atween us what goes there

is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned

hawkeye slowly shook his head and beckoned for duncan to follow him
to a spot to which the glare from the fire did not extend when he
had taken this precaution the scout placed himself in an attitude of
intense attention and listened long and keenly for a repetition of the
low sound that had so unexpectedly startled him his vigilance however
seemed exercised in vain for after a fruitless pause he whispered to
duncan

we must give a call to uncas the boy has indian senses and he may
hear what is hid from us for being a white-skin i will not deny my
nature

the young mohican who was conversing in a low voice with his father
started as he heard the moaning of an owl and springing on his feet
he looked toward the black mounds as if seeking the place whence the
sounds proceeded the scout repeated the call and in a few moments
duncan saw the figure of uncas stealing cautiously along the rampart to
the spot where they stood

hawkeye explained his wishes in a very few words which were spoken in
the delaware tongue so soon as uncas was in possession of the reason
why he was summoned he threw himself flat on the turf where to the
eyes of duncan he appeared to lie quiet and motionless surprised at
the immovable attitude of the young warrior and curious to observe
the manner in which he employed his faculties to obtain the desired
information heyward advanced a few steps and bent over the dark object
on which he had kept his eye riveted then it was he discovered that the
form of uncas vanished and that he beheld only the dark outline of an
inequality in the embankment

what has become of the mohican he demanded of the scout stepping
back in amazement it was here that i saw him fall and could have
sworn that here he yet remained

hist speak lower for we know not what ears are open and the mingoes
are a quick-witted breed as for uncas he is out on the plain and the
maquas if any such are about us will find their equal

you think that montcalm has not called off all his indians let us give
the alarm to our companions that we may stand to our arms here are
five of us who are not unused to meet an enemy

not a word to either as you value your life look at the sagamore how
like a grand indian chief he sits by the fire if there are any skulkers
out in the darkness they will never discover by his countenance that
we suspect danger at hand

but they may discover him and it will prove his death his person can
be too plainly seen by the light of that fire and he will become the
first and most certain victim

it is undeniable that now you speak the truth returned the scout
betraying more anxiety than was usual yet what can be done a single
suspicious look might bring on an attack before we are ready to receive
it he knows by the call i gave to uncas that we have struck a scent
i will tell him that we are on the trail of the mingoes his indian
nature will teach him how to act

the scout applied his fingers to his mouth and raised a low hissing
sound that caused duncan at first to start aside believing that he
heard a serpent the head of chingachgook was resting on a hand as he
sat musing by himself but the moment he had heard the warning of the
animal whose name he bore he arose to an upright position and his dark
eyes glanced swiftly and keenly on every side of him with his sudden
and perhaps involuntary movement every appearance of surprise or
alarm ended his rifle lay untouched and apparently unnoticed within
reach of his hand the tomahawk that he had loosened in his belt for the
sake of ease was even suffered to fall from its usual situation to the
ground and his form seemed to sink like that of a man whose nerves
and sinews were suffered to relax for the purpose of rest cunningly
resuming his former position though with a change of hands as if the
movement had been made merely to relieve the limb the native awaited
the result with a calmness and fortitude that none but an indian warrior
would have known how to exercise

but heyward saw that while to a less instructed eye the mohican chief
appeared to slumber his nostrils were expanded his head was turned a
little to one side as if to assist the organs of hearing and that his
quick and rapid glances ran incessantly over every object within the
power of his vision

see the noble fellow whispered hawkeye pressing the arm of heyward
he knows that a look or a motion might disconsart our schemes and put
us at the mercy of them imps 

he was interrupted by the flash and report of a rifle the air was
filled with sparks of fire around that spot where the eyes of heyward
were still fastened with admiration and wonder a second look told him
that chingachgook had disappeared in the confusion in the meantime the
scout had thrown forward his rifle like one prepared for service and
awaited impatiently the moment when an enemy might rise to view
but with the solitary and fruitless attempt made on the life of
chingachgook the attack appeared to have terminated once or twice the
listeners thought they could distinguish the distant rustling of bushes
as bodies of some unknown description rushed through them nor was it
long before hawkeye pointed out the scampering of the wolves as they
fled precipitately before the passage of some intruder on their proper
domains after an impatient and breathless pause a plunge was heard
in the water and it was immediately followed by the report of another
rifle

there goes uncas said the scout the boy bears a smart piece i know
its crack as well as a father knows the language of his child for i
carried the gun myself until a better offered

what can this mean demanded duncan we are watched and as it would
seem marked for destruction

yonder scattered brand can witness that no good was intended and this
indian will testify that no harm has been done returned the scout
dropping his rifle across his arm again and following chingachgook who
just then reappeared within the circle of light into the bosom of the
work how is it sagamore are the mingoes upon us in earnest or is it
only one of those reptiles who hang upon the skirts of a war-party
to scalp the dead go in and make their boast among the squaws of the
valiant deeds done on the pale faces

chingachgook very quietly resumed his seat nor did he make any reply
until after he had examined the firebrand which had been struck by
the bullet that had nearly proved fatal to himself after which he was
content to reply holding a single finger up to view with the english
monosyllable

one

i thought as much returned hawkeye seating himself and as he had
got the cover of the lake afore uncas pulled upon him it is more than
probable the knave will sing his lies about some great ambushment
in which he was outlying on the trail of two mohicans and a white
hunter for the officers can be considered as little better than idlers
in such a scrimmage well let him let him there are always some
honest men in every nation though heaven knows too that they are
scarce among the maquas to look down an upstart when he brags ag'in the
face of reason the varlet sent his lead within whistle of your ears
sagamore

chingachgook turned a calm and incurious eye toward the place where the
ball had struck and then resumed his former attitude with a composure
that could not be disturbed by so trifling an incident just then uncas
glided into the circle and seated himself at the fire with the same
appearance of indifference as was maintained by his father

of these several moments heyward was a deeply interested and wondering
observer it appeared to him as though the foresters had some secret
means of intelligence which had escaped the vigilance of his own
faculties in place of that eager and garrulous narration with which
a white youth would have endeavored to communicate and perhaps
exaggerate that which had passed out in the darkness of the plain
the young warrior was seemingly content to let his deeds speak for
themselves it was in fact neither the moment nor the occasion for an
indian to boast of his exploits and it is probably that had heyward
neglected to inquire not another syllable would just then have been
uttered on the subject

what has become of our enemy uncas demanded duncan we heard your
rifle and hoped you had not fired in vain

the young chief removed a fold of his hunting skirt and quietly
exposed the fatal tuft of hair which he bore as the symbol of victory
chingachgook laid his hand on the scalp and considered it for a moment
with deep attention then dropping it with disgust depicted in his
strong features he ejaculated

oneida

oneida repeated the scout who was fast losing his interest in the
scene in an apathy nearly assimilated to that of his red associates
but who now advanced in uncommon earnestness to regard the bloody badge
by the lord if the oneidas are outlying upon the trail we shall by
flanked by devils on every side of us now to white eyes there is no
difference between this bit of skin and that of any other indian and
yet the sagamore declares it came from the poll of a mingo nay he even
names the tribe of the poor devil with as much ease as if the scalp was
the leaf of a book and each hair a letter what right have christian
whites to boast of their learning when a savage can read a language
that would prove too much for the wisest of them all what say you lad
of what people was the knave

uncas raised his eyes to the face of the scout and answered in his
soft voice

oneida

oneida again when one indian makes a declaration it is commonly true
but when he is supported by his people set it down as gospel

the poor fellow has mistaken us for french said heyward or he would
not have attempted the life of a friend

he mistake a mohican in his paint for a huron you would be as likely
to mistake the white-coated grenadiers of montcalm for the scarlet
jackets of the royal americans returned the scout no no the
sarpent knew his errand nor was there any great mistake in the matter
for there is but little love atween a delaware and a mingo let their
tribes go out to fight for whom they may in a white quarrel for
that matter though the oneidas do serve his sacred majesty who is
my sovereign lord and master i should not have deliberated long about
letting off killdeer at the imp myself had luck thrown him in my
way

that would have been an abuse of our treaties and unworthy of your
character

when a man consort much with a people continued hawkeye if they
were honest and he no knave love will grow up atwixt them it is true
that white cunning has managed to throw the tribes into great confusion
as respects friends and enemies so that the hurons and the oneidas who
speak the same tongue or what may be called the same take each other's
scalps and the delawares are divided among themselves a few hanging
about their great council-fire on their own river and fighting on the
same side with the mingoes while the greater part are in the canadas
out of natural enmity to the maquas thus throwing everything into
disorder and destroying all the harmony of warfare yet a red natur is
not likely to alter with every shift of policy so that the love atwixt
a mohican and a mingo is much like the regard between a white man and a
sarpent

i regret to hear it for i had believed those natives who dwelt within
our boundaries had found us too just and liberal not to identify
themselves fully with our quarrels

why i believe it is natur to give a preference to one's own quarrels
before those of strangers now for myself i do love justice and
therefore i will not say i hate a mingo for that may be unsuitable to
my color and my religion though i will just repeat it may have been
owing to the night that killdeer had no hand in the death of this
skulking oneida

then as if satisfied with the force of his own reasons whatever might
be their effect on the opinions of the other disputant the honest but
implacable woodsman turned from the fire content to let the controversy
slumber heyward withdrew to the rampart too uneasy and too little
accustomed to the warfare of the woods to remain at ease under the
possibility of such insidious attacks not so however with the scout
and the mohicans those acute and long-practised senses whose powers so
often exceed the limits of all ordinary credulity after having detected
the danger had enabled them to ascertain its magnitude and duration
not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt their perfect
security as was indicated by the preparations that were soon made to
sit in council over their future proceedings

the confusion of nations and even of tribes to which hawkeye alluded
existed at that period in the fullest force the great tie of language
and of course of a common origin was severed in many places and it
was one of its consequences that the delaware and the mingo as the
people of the six nations were called were found fighting in the same
ranks while the latter sought the scalp of the huron though believed
to be the root of his own stock the delawares were even divided among
themselves though love for the soil which had belonged to his ancestors
kept the sagamore of the mohicans with a small band of followers who
were serving at edward under the banners of the english king by far
the largest portion of his nation were known to be in the field as
allies of montcalm the reader probably knows if enough has not already
been gleaned form this narrative that the delaware or lenape claimed
to be the progenitors of that numerous people who once were masters
of most of the eastern and northern states of america of whom the
community of the mohicans was an ancient and highly honored member

it was of course with a perfect understanding of the minute and
intricate interests which had armed friend against friend and brought
natural enemies to combat by each other's side that the scout and his
companions now disposed themselves to deliberate on the measures that
were to govern their future movements amid so many jarring and savage
races of men duncan knew enough of indian customs to understand
the reason that the fire was replenished and why the warriors not
excepting hawkeye took their seats within the curl of its smoke with
so much gravity and decorum placing himself at an angle of the works
where he might be a spectator of the scene without he awaited the
result with as much patience as he could summon

after a short and impressive pause chingachgook lighted a pipe whose
bowl was curiously carved in one of the soft stones of the country
and whose stem was a tube of wood and commenced smoking when he had
inhaled enough of the fragrance of the soothing weed he passed the
instrument into the hands of the scout in this manner the pipe had made
its rounds three several times amid the most profound silence before
either of the party opened his lips then the sagamore as the oldest
and highest in rank in a few calm and dignified words proposed the
subject for deliberation he was answered by the scout and chingachgook
rejoined when the other objected to his opinions but the youthful
uncas continued a silent and respectful listener until hawkeye in
complaisance demanded his opinion heyward gathered from the manners of
the different speakers that the father and son espoused one side of a
disputed question while the white man maintained the other the contest
gradually grew warmer until it was quite evident the feelings of the
speakers began to be somewhat enlisted in the debate

notwithstanding the increasing warmth of the amicable contest the
most decorous christian assembly not even excepting those in which its
reverend ministers are collected might have learned a wholesome lesson
of moderation from the forbearance and courtesy of the disputants the
words of uncas were received with the same deep attention as those which
fell from the maturer wisdom of his father and so far from manifesting
any impatience neither spoke in reply until a few moments of silent
meditation were seemingly bestowed in deliberating on what had already
been said

the language of the mohicans was accompanied by gestures so direct and
natural that heyward had but little difficulty in following the thread
of their argument on the other hand the scout was obscure because
from the lingering pride of color he rather affected the cold and
artificial manner which characterizes all classes of anglo-americans
when unexcited by the frequency with which the indians described the
marks of a forest trial it was evident they urged a pursuit by land
while the repeated sweep of hawkeye's arm toward the horican denoted
that he was for a passage across its waters

the latter was to every appearance fast losing ground and the point was
about to be decided against him when he arose to his feet and shaking
off his apathy he suddenly assumed the manner of an indian and adopted
all the arts of native eloquence elevating an arm he pointed out the
track of the sun repeating the gesture for every day that was necessary
to accomplish their objects then he delineated a long and painful path
amid rocks and water-courses the age and weakness of the slumbering and
unconscious munro were indicated by signs too palpable to be mistaken
duncan perceived that even his own powers were spoken lightly of as
the scout extended his palm and mentioned him by the appellation of
the open hand a name his liberality had purchased of all the friendly
tribes then came a representation of the light and graceful movements
of a canoe set in forcible contrast to the tottering steps of one
enfeebled and tired he concluded by pointing to the scalp of the
oneida and apparently urging the necessity of their departing speedily
and in a manner that should leave no trail

the mohicans listened gravely and with countenances that reflected the
sentiments of the speaker conviction gradually wrought its influence
and toward the close of hawkeye's speech his sentences were accompanied
by the customary exclamation of commendation in short uncas and his
father became converts to his way of thinking abandoning their own
previously expressed opinions with a liberality and candor that had
they been the representatives of some great and civilized people would
have infallibly worked their political ruin by destroying forever their
reputation for consistency

the instant the matter in discussion was decided the debate and
everything connected with it except the result appeared to be
forgotten hawkeye without looking round to read his triumph in
applauding eyes very composedly stretched his tall frame before the
dying embers and closed his own organs in sleep

left now in a measure to themselves the mohicans whose time had been
so much devoted to the interests of others seized the moment to devote
some attention to themselves casting off at once the grave and austere
demeanor of an indian chief chingachgook commenced speaking to his
son in the soft and playful tones of affection uncas gladly met the
familiar air of his father and before the hard breathing of the scout
announced that he slept a complete change was effected in the manner of
his two associates

it is impossible to describe the music of their language while thus
engaged in laughter and endearments in such a way as to render it
intelligible to those whose ears have never listened to its melody
the compass of their voices particularly that of the youth was
wonderful extending from the deepest bass to tones that were even
feminine in softness the eyes of the father followed the plastic and
ingenious movements of the son with open delight and he never failed to
smile in reply to the other's contagious but low laughter while under
the influence of these gentle and natural feelings no trace of ferocity
was to be seen in the softened features of the sagamore his figured
panoply of death looked more like a disguise assumed in mockery than a
fierce annunciation of a desire to carry destruction in his footsteps

after an hour had passed in the indulgence of their better feelings
chingachgook abruptly announced his desire to sleep by wrapping his
head in his blanket and stretching his form on the naked earth the
merriment of uncas instantly ceased and carefully raking the coals in
such a manner that they should impart their warmth to his father's feet
the youth sought his own pillow among the ruins of the place

imbibing renewed confidence from the security of these experienced
foresters heyward soon imitated their example and long before the
night had turned they who lay in the bosom of the ruined work seemed
to slumber as heavily as the unconscious multitude whose bones were
already beginning to bleach on the surrounding plain




chapter 

 land of albania let me bend mine eyes
 on thee thou rugged nurse of savage men
 childe harold

the heavens were still studded with stars when hawkeye came to arouse
the sleepers casting aside their cloaks munro and heyward were on their
feet while the woodsman was still making his low calls at the entrance
of the rude shelter where they had passed the night when they issued
from beneath its concealment they found the scout awaiting their
appearance nigh by and the only salutation between them was the
significant gesture for silence made by their sagacious leader

think over your prayers he whispered as they approached him for he
to whom you make them knows all tongues that of the heart as well
as those of the mouth but speak not a syllable it is rare for a white
voice to pitch itself properly in the woods as we have seen by the
example of that miserable devil the singer come he continued
turning toward a curtain of the works let us get into the ditch on
this side and be regardful to step on the stones and fragments of wood
as you go

his companions complied though to two of them the reasons of this
extraordinary precaution were yet a mystery when they were in the low
cavity that surrounded the earthen fort on three sides they found that
passage nearly choked by the ruins with care and patience however
they succeeded in clambering after the scout until they reached the
sandy shore of the horican

that's a trail that nothing but a nose can follow said the satisfied
scout looking back along their difficult way grass is a treacherous
carpet for a flying party to tread on but wood and stone take no print
from a moccasin had you worn your armed boots there might indeed
have been something to fear but with the deer-skin suitably prepared
a man may trust himself generally on rocks with safety shove in the
canoe nigher to the land uncas this sand will take a stamp as easily
as the butter of the jarmans on the mohawk softly lad softly it must
not touch the beach or the knaves will know by what road we have left
the place

the young man observed the precaution and the scout laying a board
from the ruins to the canoe made a sign for the two officers to enter
when this was done everything was studiously restored to its former
disorder and then hawkeye succeeded in reaching his little birchen
vessel without leaving behind him any of those marks which he appeared
so much to dread heyward was silent until the indians had cautiously
paddled the canoe some distance from the fort and within the broad and
dark shadows that fell from the eastern mountain on the glassy surface
of the lake then he demanded

what need have we for this stolen and hurried departure

if the blood of an oneida could stain such a sheet of pure water as
this we float on returned the scout your two eyes would answer your
own question have you forgotten the skulking reptile uncas slew

by no means but he was said to be alone and dead men give no cause
for fear

ay he was alone in his deviltry but an indian whose tribe counts so
many warriors need seldom fear his blood will run without the death
shriek coming speedily from some of his enemies

but our presence the authority of colonel munro would prove
sufficient protection against the anger of our allies especially in a
case where the wretch so well merited his fate i trust in heaven you
have not deviated a single foot from the direct line of our course with
so slight a reason

do you think the bullet of that varlet's rifle would have turned aside
though his sacred majesty the king had stood in its path returned
the stubborn scout why did not the grand frencher he who is
captain-general of the canadas bury the tomahawks of the hurons if a
word from a white can work so strongly on the natur of an indian

the reply of heyward was interrupted by a groan from munro but after
he had paused a moment in deference to the sorrow of his aged friend he
resumed the subject

the marquis of montcalm can only settle that error with his god said
the young man solemnly

ay ay now there is reason in your words for they are bottomed on
religion and honesty there is a vast difference between throwing a
regiment of white coats atwixt the tribes and the prisoners and coaxing
an angry savage to forget he carries a knife and rifle with words that
must begin with calling him your son no no continued the scout
looking back at the dim shore of william henry which was now fast
receding and laughing in his own silent but heartfelt manner i have
put a trail of water atween us and unless the imps can make friends
with the fishes and hear who has paddled across their basin this fine
morning we shall throw the length of the horican behind us before they
have made up their minds which path to take

with foes in front and foes in our rear our journey is like to be one
of danger

danger repeated hawkeye calmly no not absolutely of danger for
with vigilant ears and quick eyes we can manage to keep a few hours
ahead of the knaves or if we must try the rifle there are three of us
who understand its gifts as well as any you can name on the borders no
not of danger but that we shall have what you may call a brisk push of
it is probable and it may happen a brush a scrimmage or some such
divarsion but always where covers are good and ammunition abundant

it is possible that heyward's estimate of danger differed in some degree
from that of the scout for instead of replying he now sat in silence
while the canoe glided over several miles of water just as the day
dawned they entered the narrows of the lake and stole swiftly and
cautiously among their numberless little islands it was by this road
that montcalm had retired with his army and the adventurers knew not
but he had left some of his indians in ambush to protect the rear of
his forces and collect the stragglers they therefore approached the
passage with the customary silence of their guarded habits

 the beauties of lake george are well known to every
 american tourist in the height of the mountains which
 surround it and in artificial accessories it is inferior
 to the finest of the swiss and italian lakes while in
 outline and purity of water it is fully their equal and in
 the number and disposition of its isles and islets much
 superior to them all together there are said to be some
 hundreds of islands in a sheet of water less than thirty
 miles long the narrows which connect what may be called
 in truth two lakes are crowded with islands to such a
 degree as to leave passages between them frequently of only
 a few feet in width the lake itself varies in breadth from
 one to three miles

chingachgook laid aside his paddle while uncas and the scout urged the
light vessel through crooked and intricate channels where every foot
that they advanced exposed them to the danger of some sudden rising
on their progress the eyes of the sagamore moved warily from islet to
islet and copse to copse as the canoe proceeded and when a clearer
sheet of water permitted his keen vision was bent along the bald rocks
and impending forests that frowned upon the narrow strait

heyward who was a doubly interested spectator as well from the
beauties of the place as from the apprehension natural to his situation
was just believing that he had permitted the latter to be excited
without sufficient reason when the paddle ceased moving in obedience
to a signal from chingachgook

hugh exclaimed uncas nearly at the moment that the light tap his
father had made on the side of the canoe notified them of the vicinity
of danger

what now asked the scout the lake is as smooth as if the winds had
never blown and i can see along its sheet for miles there is not so
much as the black head of a loon dotting the water

the indian gravely raised his paddle and pointed in the direction
in which his own steady look was riveted duncan's eyes followed the
motion a few rods in their front lay another of the wooded islets
but it appeared as calm and peaceful as if its solitude had never been
disturbed by the foot of man

i see nothing he said but land and water and a lovely scene it
is

hist interrupted the scout ay sagamore there is always a reason
for what you do tis but a shade and yet it is not natural you see
the mist major that is rising above the island you can't call it a
fog for it is more like a streak of thin cloud 

it is vapor from the water

that a child could tell but what is the edging of blacker smoke
that hangs along its lower side and which you may trace down into the
thicket of hazel tis from a fire but one that in my judgment has
been suffered to burn low

let us then push for the place and relieve our doubts said the
impatient duncan the party must be small that can lie on such a bit of
land

if you judge of indian cunning by the rules you find in books or
by white sagacity they will lead you astray if not to your death
returned hawkeye examining the signs of the place with that acuteness
which distinguished him if i may be permitted to speak in this matter
it will be to say that we have but two things to choose between the
one is to return and give up all thoughts of following the hurons 

never exclaimed heyward in a voice far too loud for their
circumstances

well well continued hawkeye making a hasty sign to repress his
impatience i am much of your mind myself though i thought it becoming
my experience to tell the whole we must then make a push and if the
indians or frenchers are in the narrows run the gauntlet through these
toppling mountains is there reason in my words sagamore

the indian made no other answer than by dropping his paddle into the
water and urging forward the canoe as he held the office of directing
its course his resolution was sufficiently indicated by the movement
the whole party now plied their paddles vigorously and in a very few
moments they had reached a point whence they might command an entire
view of the northern shore of the island the side that had hitherto
been concealed

there they are by all the truth of signs whispered the scout two
canoes and a smoke the knaves haven't yet got their eyes out of the
mist or we should hear the accursed whoop together friends we are
leaving them and are already nearly out of whistle of a bullet

the well-known crack of a rifle whose ball came skipping along the
placid surface of the strait and a shrill yell from the island
interrupted his speech and announced that their passage was discovered
in another instant several savages were seen rushing into canoes which
were soon dancing over the water in pursuit these fearful precursors of
a coming struggle produced no change in the countenances and movements
of his three guides so far as duncan could discover except that the
strokes of their paddles were longer and more in unison and caused
the little bark to spring forward like a creature possessing life and
volition

hold them there sagamore said hawkeye looking coolly backward over
this left shoulder while he still plied his paddle keep them just
there them hurons have never a piece in their nation that will execute
at this distance but killdeer has a barrel on which a man may
calculate

the scout having ascertained that the mohicans were sufficient of
themselves to maintain the requisite distance deliberately laid aside
his paddle and raised the fatal rifle three several times he brought
the piece to his shoulder and when his companions were expecting its
report he as often lowered it to request the indians would permit
their enemies to approach a little nigher at length his accurate and
fastidious eye seemed satisfied and throwing out his left arm on the
barrel he was slowly elevating the muzzle when an exclamation from
uncas who sat in the bow once more caused him to suspend the shot

what now lad demanded hawkeye you save a huron from the
death-shriek by that word have you reason for what you do

uncas pointed toward a rocky shore a little in their front whence
another war canoe was darting directly across their course it was too
obvious now that their situation was imminently perilous to need the aid
of language to confirm it the scout laid aside his rifle and resumed
the paddle while chingachgook inclined the bows of the canoe a little
toward the western shore in order to increase the distance between them
and this new enemy in the meantime they were reminded of the presence
of those who pressed upon their rear by wild and exulting shouts the
stirring scene awakened even munro from his apathy

let us make for the rocks on the main he said with the mien of a
tired soldier and give battle to the savages god forbid that i or
those attached to me and mine should ever trust again to the faith of
any servant of the louis's

he who wishes to prosper in indian warfare returned the scout must
not be too proud to learn from the wit of a native lay her more along
the land sagamore we are doubling on the varlets and perhaps they may
try to strike our trail on the long calculation

hawkeye was not mistaken for when the hurons found their course was
likely to throw them behind their chase they rendered it less direct
until by gradually bearing more and more obliquely the two canoes
were ere long gliding on parallel lines within two hundred yards of
each other it now became entirely a trial of speed so rapid was the
progress of the light vessels that the lake curled in their front in
miniature waves and their motion became undulating by its own velocity
it was perhaps owing to this circumstance in addition to the
necessity of keeping every hand employed at the paddles that the hurons
had not immediate recourse to their firearms the exertions of the
fugitives were too severe to continue long and the pursuers had the
advantage of numbers duncan observed with uneasiness that the scout
began to look anxiously about him as if searching for some further
means of assisting their flight

edge her a little more from the sun sagamore said the stubborn
woodsman i see the knaves are sparing a man to the rifle a single
broken bone might lose us our scalps edge more from the sun and we will
put the island between us

the expedient was not without its use a long low island lay at a
little distance before them and as they closed with it the chasing
canoe was compelled to take a side opposite to that on which the pursued
passed the scout and his companions did not neglect this advantage but
the instant they were hid from observation by the bushes they redoubled
efforts that before had seemed prodigious the two canoes came round
the last low point like two coursers at the top of their speed the
fugitives taking the lead this change had brought them nigher to each
other however while it altered their relative positions

you showed knowledge in the shaping of a birchen bark uncas when
you chose this from among the huron canoes said the scout smiling
apparently more in satisfaction at their superiority in the race than
from that prospect of final escape which now began to open a little upon
them the imps have put all their strength again at the paddles and we
are to struggle for our scalps with bits of flattened wood instead of
clouded barrels and true eyes a long stroke and together friends

they are preparing for a shot said heyward and as we are in a line
with them it can scarcely fail

get you then into the bottom of the canoe returned the scout you
and the colonel it will be so much taken from the size of the mark

heyward smiled as he answered

it would be but an ill example for the highest in rank to dodge while
the warriors were under fire

lord lord that is now a white man's courage exclaimed the scout
and like to many of his notions not to be maintained by reason do you
think the sagamore or uncas or even i who am a man without a cross
would deliberate about finding a cover in the scrimmage when an open
body would do no good for what have the frenchers reared up their
quebec if fighting is always to be done in the clearings

all that you say is very true my friend replied heyward still our
customs must prevent us from doing as you wish

a volley from the hurons interrupted the discourse and as the bullets
whistled about them duncan saw the head of uncas turned looking back
at himself and munro notwithstanding the nearness of the enemy and
his own great personal danger the countenance of the young warrior
expressed no other emotion as the former was compelled to think than
amazement at finding men willing to encounter so useless an exposure
chingachgook was probably better acquainted with the notions of white
men for he did not even cast a glance aside from the riveted look his
eye maintained on the object by which he governed their course a ball
soon struck the light and polished paddle from the hands of the chief
and drove it through the air far in the advance a shout arose from
the hurons who seized the opportunity to fire another volley uncas
described an arc in the water with his own blade and as the canoe
passed swiftly on chingachgook recovered his paddle and flourishing
it on high he gave the war-whoop of the mohicans and then lent his
strength and skill again to the important task

the clamorous sounds of le gros serpent la longue carabine le
cerf agile burst at once from the canoes behind and seemed to give
new zeal to the pursuers the scout seized killdeer in his left hand
and elevating it about his head he shook it in triumph at his enemies
the savages answered the insult with a yell and immediately another
volley succeeded the bullets pattered along the lake and one even
pierced the bark of their little vessel no perceptible emotion could
be discovered in the mohicans during this critical moment their rigid
features expressing neither hope nor alarm but the scout again turned
his head and laughing in his own silent manner he said to heyward

the knaves love to hear the sounds of their pieces but the eye is
not to be found among the mingoes that can calculate a true range in a
dancing canoe you see the dumb devils have taken off a man to charge
and by the smallest measurement that can be allowed we move three feet
to their two

duncan who was not altogether as easy under this nice estimate of
distances as his companions was glad to find however that owing to
their superior dexterity and the diversion among their enemies they
were very sensibly obtaining the advantage the hurons soon fired again
and a bullet struck the blade of hawkeye's paddle without injury

that will do said the scout examining the slight indentation with a
curious eye it would not have cut the skin of an infant much less of
men who like us have been blown upon by the heavens in their anger
now major if you will try to use this piece of flattened wood i'll
let killdeer take a part in the conversation

heyward seized the paddle and applied himself to the work with an
eagerness that supplied the place of skill while hawkeye was engaged
in inspecting the priming of his rifle the latter then took a swift aim
and fired the huron in the bows of the leading canoe had risen with a
similar object and he now fell backward suffering his gun to escape
from his hands into the water in an instant however he recovered his
feet though his gestures were wild and bewildered at the same moment
his companions suspended their efforts and the chasing canoes clustered
together and became stationary chingachgook and uncas profited by the
interval to regain their wind though duncan continued to work with
the most persevering industry the father and son now cast calm but
inquiring glances at each other to learn if either had sustained any
injury by the fire for both well knew that no cry or exclamation
would in such a moment of necessity have been permitted to betray the
accident a few large drops of blood were trickling down the shoulder
of the sagamore who when he perceived that the eyes of uncas dwelt
too long on the sight raised some water in the hollow of his hand and
washing off the stain was content to manifest in this simple manner
the slightness of the injury

softly softly major said the scout who by this time had reloaded
his rifle we are a little too far already for a rifle to put forth its
beauties and you see yonder imps are holding a council let them
come up within striking distance my eye may well be trusted in such
a matter and i will trail the varlets the length of the horican
guaranteeing that not a shot of theirs shall at the worst more than
break the skin while killdeer shall touch the life twice in three
times

we forget our errand returned the diligent duncan for god's sake
let us profit by this advantage and increase our distance from the
enemy

give me my children said munro hoarsely trifle no longer with a
father's agony but restore me my babes

long and habitual deference to the mandates of his superiors had taught
the scout the virtue of obedience throwing a last and lingering glance
at the distant canoes he laid aside his rifle and relieving the
wearied duncan resumed the paddle which he wielded with sinews that
never tired his efforts were seconded by those of the mohicans and a
very few minutes served to place such a sheet of water between them and
their enemies that heyward once more breathed freely

the lake now began to expand and their route lay along a wide reach
that was lined as before by high and ragged mountains but the islands
were few and easily avoided the strokes of the paddles grew more
measured and regular while they who plied them continued their labor
after the close and deadly chase from which they had just relieved
themselves with as much coolness as though their speed had been tried
in sport rather than under such pressing nay almost desperate
circumstances

instead of following the western shore whither their errand led them
the wary mohican inclined his course more toward those hills behind
which montcalm was known to have led his army into the formidable
fortress of ticonderoga as the hurons to every appearance had
abandoned the pursuit there was no apparent reason for this excess of
caution it was however maintained for hours until they had reached
a bay nigh the northern termination of the lake here the canoe was
driven upon the beach and the whole party landed hawkeye and heyward
ascended an adjacent bluff where the former after considering the
expanse of water beneath him pointed out to the latter a small black
object hovering under a headland at the distance of several miles

do you see it demanded the scout now what would you account that
spot were you left alone to white experience to find your way through
this wilderness

but for its distance and its magnitude i should suppose it a bird can
it be a living object

tis a canoe of good birchen bark and paddled by fierce and crafty
mingoes though providence has lent to those who inhabit the woods
eyes that would be needless to men in the settlements where there are
inventions to assist the sight yet no human organs can see all the
dangers which at this moment circumvent us these varlets pretend to be
bent chiefly on their sun-down meal but the moment it is dark they will
be on our trail as true as hounds on the scent we must throw them
off or our pursuit of le renard subtil may be given up these lakes are
useful at times especially when the game take the water continued the
scout gazing about him with a countenance of concern but they give no
cover except it be to the fishes god knows what the country would
be if the settlements should ever spread far from the two rivers both
hunting and war would lose their beauty

let us not delay a moment without some good and obvious cause

i little like that smoke which you may see worming up along the rock
above the canoe interrupted the abstracted scout my life on it
other eyes than ours see it and know its meaning well words will not
mend the matter and it is time that we were doing

hawkeye moved away from the lookout and descended musing profoundly
to the shore he communicated the result of his observations to his
companions in delaware and a short and earnest consultation succeeded
when it terminated the three instantly set about executing their new
resolutions

the canoe was lifted from the water and borne on the shoulders of the
party they proceeded into the wood making as broad and obvious a trail
as possible they soon reached the water-course which they crossed
and continuing onward until they came to an extensive and naked rock
at this point where their footsteps might be expected to be no longer
visible they retraced their route to the brook walking backward with
the utmost care they now followed the bed of the little stream to the
lake into which they immediately launched their canoe again a low
point concealed them from the headland and the margin of the lake was
fringed for some distance with dense and overhanging bushes under the
cover of these natural advantages they toiled their way with patient
industry until the scout pronounced that he believed it would be safe
once more to land

the halt continued until evening rendered objects indistinct and
uncertain to the eye then they resumed their route and favored by
the darkness pushed silently and vigorously toward the western shore
although the rugged outline of mountain to which they were steering
presented no distinctive marks to the eyes of duncan the mohican
entered the little haven he had selected with the confidence and
accuracy of an experienced pilot

the boat was again lifted and borne into the woods where it was
carefully concealed under a pile of brush the adventurers assumed their
arms and packs and the scout announced to munro and heyward that he and
the indians were at last in readiness to proceed




chapter 

 if you find a man there he shall die a flea's death
 merry wives of windsor

the party had landed on the border of a region that is even to this
day less known to the inhabitants of the states than the deserts
of arabia or the steppes of tartary it was the sterile and rugged
district which separates the tributaries of champlain from those of the
hudson the mohawk and the st lawrence since the period of our tale
the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich
and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is
ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses

as hawkeye and the mohicans had however often traversed the mountains
and valleys of this vast wilderness they did not hesitate to plunge
into its depth with the freedom of men accustomed to its privations
and difficulties for many hours the travelers toiled on their laborious
way guided by a star or following the direction of some water-course
until the scout called a halt and holding a short consultation with
the indians they lighted their fire and made the usual preparations to
pass the remainder of the night where they then were

imitating the example and emulating the confidence of their more
experienced associates munro and duncan slept without fear if not
without uneasiness the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had
dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the
forest when the travelers resumed their journey

after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the
advance became more deliberate and watchful he often stopped to
examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively
considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook
were frequent and earnest during one of these conferences heyward
observed that uncas stood a patient and silent though as he imagined
an interested listener he was strongly tempted to address the young
chief and demand his opinion of their progress but the calm and
dignified demeanor of the native induced him to believe that like
himself the other was wholly dependent on the sagacity and intelligence
of the seniors of the party at last the scout spoke in english and at
once explained the embarrassment of their situation

when i found that the home path of the hurons run north he said it
did not need the judgment of many long years to tell that they would
follow the valleys and keep atween the waters of the hudson and the
horican until they might strike the springs of the canada streams
which would lead them into the heart of the country of the frenchers
yet here are we within a short range of the scaroons and not a sign of
a trail have we crossed human natur is weak and it is possible we may
not have taken the proper scent

heaven protect us from such an error exclaimed duncan let us
retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes has uncas no
counsel to offer in such a strait

the young mohican cast a glance at his father but maintaining his
quiet and reserved mien he continued silent chingachgook had caught
the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak the moment
this permission was accorded the countenance of uncas changed from its
grave composure to a gleam of intelligence and joy bounding forward
like a deer he sprang up the side of a little acclivity a few rods in
advance and stood exultingly over a spot of fresh earth that looked
as though it had been recently upturned by the passage of some heavy
animal the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement
and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed

tis the trail exclaimed the scout advancing to the spot the lad
is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years

tis extraordinary that he should have withheld his knowledge so long
muttered duncan at his elbow

it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
no no your young white who gathers his learning from books and can
measure what he knows by the page may conceit that his knowledge like
his legs outruns that of his fathers but where experience is the
master the scholar is made to know the value of years and respects
them accordingly

see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the
broad trail on either side of him the dark-hair has gone toward the
forest

hound never ran on a more beautiful scent responded the scout
dashing forward at once on the indicated route we are favored
greatly favored and can follow with high noses ay here are both your
waddling beasts this huron travels like a white general the fellow is
stricken with a judgment and is mad look sharp for wheels sagamore
he continued looking back and laughing in his newly awakened
satisfaction we shall soon have the fool journeying in a coach and
that with three of the best pair of eyes on the borders in his rear

the spirits of the scout and the astonishing success of the chase in
which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed
did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party their
advance was rapid and made with as much confidence as a traveler would
proceed along a wide highway if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth
harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the
true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered
the delay of a single moment necessary their progress was much
facilitated by the certainty that magua had found it necessary to
journey through the valleys a circumstance which rendered the general
direction of the route sure nor had the huron entirely neglected the
arts uniformly practised by the natives when retiring in front of an
enemy false trails and sudden turnings were frequent wherever a brook
or the formation of the ground rendered them feasible but his pursuers
were rarely deceived and never failed to detect their error before
they had lost either time or distance on the deceptive track

by the middle of the afternoon they had passed the scaroons and were
following the route of the declining sun after descending an eminence
to a low bottom through which a swift stream glided they suddenly came
to a place where the party of le renard had made a halt extinguished
brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered
about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been
browsed by the horses at a little distance heyward discovered and
contemplated with tender emotion the small bower under which he was
fain to believe that cora and alice had reposed but while the earth
was trodden and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly
visible around the place the trail appeared to have suddenly ended

it was easy to follow the tracks of the narragansetts but they seemed
only to have wandered without guides or any other object than the
pursuit of food at length uncas who with his father had endeavored
to trace the route of the horses came upon a sign of their presence
that was quite recent before following the clew he communicated his
success to his companions and while the latter were consulting on the
circumstance the youth reappeared leading the two fillies with
their saddles broken and the housings soiled as though they had been
permitted to run at will for several days

what should this prove said duncan turning pale and glancing his
eyes around him as if he feared the brush and leaves were about to give
up some horrid secret

that our march is come to a quick end and that we are in an enemy's
country returned the scout had the knave been pressed and the
gentle ones wanted horses to keep up with the party he might have taken
their scalps but without an enemy at his heels and with such rugged
beasts as these he would not hurt a hair of their heads i know your
thoughts and shame be it to our color that you have reason for them
but he who thinks that even a mingo would ill-treat a woman unless it
be to tomahawk her knows nothing of indian natur or the laws of the
woods no no i have heard that the french indians had come into these
hills to hunt the moose and we are getting within scent of their camp
why should they not the morning and evening guns of ty may be heard
any day among these mountains for the frenchers are running a new line
atween the provinces of the king and the canadas it is true that the
horses are here but the hurons are gone let us then hunt for the
path by which they parted

hawkeye and the mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good
earnest a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn
and each of the party took a segment for his portion the examination
however resulted in no discovery the impressions of footsteps were
numerous but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered
about the spot without any design to quit it again the scout and his
companions made the circuit of the halting place each slowly following
the other until they assembled in the center once more no wiser than
when they started

such cunning is not without its deviltry exclaimed hawkeye when he
met the disappointed looks of his assistants

we must get down to it sagamore beginning at the spring and going
over the ground by inches the huron shall never brag in his tribe that
he has a foot which leaves no print

setting the example himself the scout engaged in the scrutiny with
renewed zeal not a leaf was left unturned the sticks were removed
and the stones lifted for indian cunning was known frequently to adopt
these objects as covers laboring with the utmost patience and industry
to conceal each footstep as they proceeded still no discovery was made
at length uncas whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion
of the task the soonest raked the earth across the turbid little rill
which ran from the spring and diverted its course into another channel
so soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry he stooped over it with
keen and curious eyes a cry of exultation immediately announced the
success of the young warrior the whole party crowded to the spot where
uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion

this lad will be an honor to his people said hawkeye regarding the
trail with as much admiration as a naturalist would expend on the tusk
of a mammoth or the rib of a mastodon ay and a thorn in the sides of
the hurons yet that is not the footstep of an indian the weight is too
much on the heel and the toes are squared as though one of the french
dancers had been in pigeon-winging his tribe run back uncas and
bring me the size of the singer's foot you will find a beautiful print
of it just opposite yon rock agin the hillside

while the youth was engaged in this commission the scout and
chingachgook were attentively considering the impressions the
measurements agreed and the former unhesitatingly pronounced that the
footstep was that of david who had once more been made to exchange his
shoes for moccasins

i can now read the whole of it as plainly as if i had seen the arts of
le subtil he added the singer being a man whose gifts lay chiefly in
his throat and feet was made to go first and the others have trod in
his steps imitating their formation

but cried duncan i see no signs of 

the gentle ones interrupted the scout the varlet has found a way to
carry them until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent
my life on it we see their pretty little feet again before many rods
go by

the whole party now proceeded following the course of the rill keeping
anxious eyes on the regular impressions the water soon flowed into its
bed again but watching the ground on either side the foresters pursued
their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath more than
half a mile was passed before the rill rippled close around the base of
an extensive and dry rock here they paused to make sure that the hurons
had not quitted the water

it was fortunate they did so for the quick and active uncas soon found
the impression of a foot on a bunch of moss where it would seem an
indian had inadvertently trodden pursuing the direction given by this
discovery he entered the neighboring thicket and struck the trail as
fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring another
shout announced the good fortune of the youth to his companions and at
once terminated the search

ay it has been planned with indian judgment said the scout when
the party was assembled around the place and would have blinded white
eyes

shall we proceed demanded heyward

softly softly we know our path but it is good to examine the
formation of things this is my schooling major and if one neglects
the book there is little chance of learning from the open land of
providence all is plain but one thing which is the manner that the
knave contrived to get the gentle ones along the blind trail even a
huron would be too proud to let their tender feet touch the water

will this assist in explaining the difficulty said heyward pointing
toward the fragments of a sort of handbarrow that had been rudely
constructed of boughs and bound together with withes and which now
seemed carelessly cast aside as useless

tis explained cried the delighted hawkeye if them varlets have
passed a minute they have spent hours in striving to fabricate a lying
end to their trail well i've known them to waste a day in the same
manner to as little purpose here we have three pair of moccasins and
two of little feet it is amazing that any mortal beings can journey on
limbs so small pass me the thong of buckskin uncas and let me take
the length of this foot by the lord it is no longer than a child's and
yet the maidens are tall and comely that providence is partial in its
gifts for its own wise reasons the best and most contented of us must
allow

the tender limbs of my daughters are unequal to these hardships said
munro looking at the light footsteps of his children with a parent's
love we shall find their fainting forms in this desert

of that there is little cause of fear returned the scout slowly
shaking his head this is a firm and straight though a light step and
not over long see the heel has hardly touched the ground and there
the dark-hair has made a little jump from root to root no no my
knowledge for it neither of them was nigh fainting hereaway now the
singer was beginning to be footsore and leg-weary as is plain by
his trail there you see he slipped here he has traveled wide and
tottered and there again it looks as though he journeyed on snowshoes
ay ay a man who uses his throat altogether can hardly give his legs a
proper training

from such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the
truth with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a
witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated
cheered by these assurances and satisfied by a reasoning that was so
obvious while it was so simple the party resumed its course after
making a short halt to take a hurried repast

when the meal was ended the scout cast a glance upward at the setting
sun and pushed forward with a rapidity which compelled heyward and the
still vigorous munro to exert all their muscles to equal their route
now lay along the bottom which has already been mentioned as the hurons
had made no further efforts to conceal their footsteps the progress of
the pursuers was no longer delayed by uncertainty before an hour had
elapsed however the speed of hawkeye sensibly abated and his head
instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look began to turn
suspiciously from side to side as if he were conscious of approaching
danger he soon stopped again and waited for the whole party to come
up

i scent the hurons he said speaking to the mohicans yonder is open
sky through the treetops and we are getting too nigh their encampment
sagamore you will take the hillside to the right uncas will bend
along the brook to the left while i will try the trail if anything
should happen the call will be three croaks of a crow i saw one of the
birds fanning himself in the air just beyond the dead oak another sign
that we are approaching an encampment

the indians departed their several ways without reply while hawkeye
cautiously proceeded with the two gentlemen heyward soon pressed to the
side of their guide eager to catch an early glimpse of those enemies
he had pursued with so much toil and anxiety his companion told him
to steal to the edge of the wood which as usual was fringed with
a thicket and wait his coming for he wished to examine certain
suspicious signs a little on one side duncan obeyed and soon found
himself in a situation to command a view which he found as extraordinary
as it was novel

the trees of many acres had been felled and the glow of a mild summer's
evening had fallen on the clearing in beautiful contrast to the gray
light of the forest a short distance from the place where duncan stood
the stream had seemingly expanded into a little lake covering most of
the low land from mountain to mountain the water fell out of this wide
basin in a cataract so regular and gentle that it appeared rather to
be the work of human hands than fashioned by nature a hundred earthen
dwellings stood on the margin of the lake and even in its waters as
though the latter had overflowed its usual banks their rounded roofs
admirably molded for defense against the weather denoted more of
industry and foresight than the natives were wont to bestow on their
regular habitations much less on those they occupied for the temporary
purposes of hunting and war in short the whole village or town
whichever it might be termed possessed more of method and neatness of
execution than the white men had been accustomed to believe belonged
ordinarily to the indian habits it appeared however to be deserted
at least so thought duncan for many minutes but at length he fancied
he discovered several human forms advancing toward him on all fours
and apparently dragging in the train some heavy and as he was quick to
apprehend some formidable engine just then a few dark-looking heads
gleamed out of the dwellings and the place seemed suddenly alive with
beings which however glided from cover to cover so swiftly as to
allow no opportunity of examining their humors or pursuits alarmed at
these suspicious and inexplicable movements he was about to attempt the
signal of the crows when the rustling of leaves at hand drew his eyes
in another direction

the young man started and recoiled a few paces instinctively when he
found himself within a hundred yards of a stranger indian recovering
his recollection on the instant instead of sounding an alarm which
might prove fatal to himself he remained stationary an attentive
observer of the other's motions

an instant of calm observation served to assure duncan that he was
undiscovered the native like himself seemed occupied in considering
the low dwellings of the village and the stolen movements of its
inhabitants it was impossible to discover the expression of his
features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were
concealed though duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage
his head was shaved as usual with the exception of the crown from
whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely
dangling a ragged calico mantle half encircled his body while his
nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt the sleeves of which
were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more
commodious arrangement his legs were however covered with a pair of
good deer-skin moccasins altogether the appearance of the individual
was forlorn and miserable

duncan was still curiously observing the person of his neighbor when the
scout stole silently and cautiously to his side

you see we have reached their settlement or encampment whispered
the young man and here is one of the savages himself in a very
embarrassing position for our further movements

hawkeye started and dropped his rifle when directed by the finger
of his companion the stranger came under his view then lowering the
dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck as if to assist a
scrutiny that was already intensely keen

the imp is not a huron he said nor of any of the canada tribes and
yet you see by his clothes the knave has been plundering a white ay
montcalm has raked the woods for his inroad and a whooping murdering
set of varlets has he gathered together can you see where he has put
his rifle or his bow

he appears to have no arms nor does he seem to be viciously inclined
unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows who as you see are
dodging about the water we have but little to fear from him

the scout turned to heyward and regarded him a moment with unconcealed
amazement then opening wide his mouth he indulged in unrestrained
and heartfelt laughter though in that silent and peculiar manner which
danger had so long taught him to practise

repeating the words fellows who are dodging about the water he
added so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements
the knave has long legs though and shall not be trusted do you keep
him under your rifle while i creep in behind through the bush and take
him alive fire on no account

heyward had already permitted his companion to bury part of his person
in the thicket when stretching forth his arm he arrested him in
order to ask

if i see you in danger may i not risk a shot

hawkeye regarded him a moment like one who knew not how to take the
question then nodding his head he answered still laughing though
inaudibly

fire a whole platoon major

in the next moment he was concealed by the leaves duncan waited several
minutes in feverish impatience before he caught another glimpse of
the scout then he reappeared creeping along the earth from which his
dress was hardly distinguishable directly in the rear of his intended
captive having reached within a few yards of the latter he arose to
his feet silently and slowly at that instant several loud blows were
struck on the water and duncan turned his eyes just in time to perceive
that a hundred dark forms were plunging in a body into the troubled
little sheet grasping his rifle his looks were again bent on the indian
near him instead of taking the alarm the unconscious savage stretched
forward his neck as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy
lake with a sort of silly curiosity in the meantime the uplifted
hand of hawkeye was above him but without any apparent reason it was
withdrawn and its owner indulged in another long though still silent
fit of merriment when the peculiar and hearty laughter of hawkeye
was ended instead of grasping his victim by the throat he tapped him
lightly on the shoulder and exclaimed aloud

how now friend have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing

even so was the ready answer it would seem that the being that gave
them power to improve his gifts so well would not deny them voices to
proclaim his praise




chapter 

 bot abibl we all met
 qui pat pat and here's a marvelous convenient place
 for our rehearsal
 midsummer night's dream

the reader may better imagine than we describe the surprise of heyward
his lurking indians were suddenly converted into four-footed beasts his
lake into a beaver pond his cataract into a dam constructed by those
industrious and ingenious quadrupeds and a suspected enemy into his
tried friend david gamut the master of psalmody the presence of the
latter created so many unexpected hopes relative to the sisters that
without a moment's hesitation the young man broke out of his ambush
and sprang forward to join the two principal actors in the scene

the merriment of hawkeye was not easily appeased without ceremony and
with a rough hand he twirled the supple gamut around on his heel and
more than once affirmed that the hurons had done themselves great credit
in the fashion of his costume then seizing the hand of the other he
squeezed it with a grip that brought tears into the eyes of the placid
david and wished him joy of his new condition

you were about opening your throat-practisings among the beavers were
ye he said the cunning devils know half the trade already for they
beat the time with their tails as you heard just now and in good time
it was too or killdeer might have sounded the first note among
them i have known greater fools who could read and write than an
experienced old beaver but as for squalling the animals are born dumb
what think you of such a song as this

david shut his sensitive ears and even heyward apprised as he was of
the nature of the cry looked upward in quest of the bird as the cawing
of a crow rang in the air about them

see continued the laughing scout as he pointed toward the remainder
of the party who in obedience to the signal were already approaching
this is music which has its natural virtues it brings two good rifles
to my elbow to say nothing of the knives and tomahawks but we see that
you are safe now tell us what has become of the maidens

they are captives to the heathen said david and though greatly
troubled in spirit enjoying comfort and safety in the body

both demanded the breathless heyward

even so though our wayfaring has been sore and our sustenance scanty
we have had little other cause for complaint except the violence done
our feelings by being thus led in captivity into a far land

bless ye for these very words exclaimed the trembling munro i shall
then receive my babes spotless and angel-like as i lost them

i know not that their delivery is at hand returned the doubting
david the leader of these savages is possessed of an evil spirit that
no power short of omnipotence can tame i have tried him sleeping and
waking but neither sounds nor language seem to touch his soul

where is the knave bluntly interrupted the scout

he hunts the moose to-day with his young men and tomorrow as i hear
they pass further into the forests and nigher to the borders of canada
the elder maiden is conveyed to a neighboring people whose lodges
are situate beyond yonder black pinnacle of rock while the younger
is detained among the women of the hurons whose dwellings are but two
short miles hence on a table-land where the fire had done the office
of the axe and prepared the place for their reception

alice my gentle alice murmured heyward she has lost the
consolation of her sister's presence

even so but so far as praise and thanksgiving in psalmody can temper
the spirit in affliction she has not suffered

has she then a heart for music

of the graver and more solemn character though it must be acknowledged
that in spite of all my endeavors the maiden weeps oftener than she
smiles at such moments i forbear to press the holy songs but there are
many sweet and comfortable periods of satisfactory communication
when the ears of the savages are astounded with the upliftings of our
voices

and why are you permitted to go at large unwatched

david composed his features into what he intended should express an air
of modest humility before he meekly replied

little be the praise to such a worm as i but though the power of
psalmody was suspended in the terrible business of that field of blood
through which we have passed it has recovered its influence even over
the souls of the heathen and i am suffered to go and come at will

the scout laughed and tapping his own forehead significantly he
perhaps explained the singular indulgence more satisfactorily when he
said

the indians never harm a non-composser but why when the path lay open
before your eyes did you not strike back on your own trail it is not
so blind as that which a squirrel would make and bring in the tidings
to edward

the scout remembering only his own sturdy and iron nature had probably
exacted a task that david under no circumstances could have performed
but without entirely losing the meekness of his air the latter was
content to answer

though my soul would rejoice to visit the habitations of christendom
once more my feet would rather follow the tender spirits intrusted to
my keeping even into the idolatrous province of the jesuits than take
one step backward while they pined in captivity and sorrow

though the figurative language of david was not very intelligible the
sincere and steady expression of his eye and the glow of his honest
countenance were not easily mistaken uncas pressed closer to his side
and regarded the speaker with a look of commendation while his
father expressed his satisfaction by the ordinary pithy exclamation of
approbation the scout shook his head as he rejoined

the lord never intended that the man should place all his endeavors in
his throat to the neglect of other and better gifts but he has fallen
into the hands of some silly woman when he should have been gathering
his education under a blue sky among the beauties of the forest here
friend i did intend to kindle a fire with this tooting-whistle of
thine but as you value the thing take it and blow your best on it

gamut received his pitch-pipe with as strong an expression of pleasure
as he believed compatible with the grave functions he exercised after
essaying its virtues repeatedly in contrast with his own voice and
satisfying himself that none of its melody was lost he made a very
serious demonstration toward achieving a few stanzas of one of the
longest effusions in the little volume so often mentioned

heyward however hastily interrupted his pious purpose by continuing
questions concerning the past and present condition of his fellow
captives and in a manner more methodical than had been permitted by his
feelings in the opening of their interview david though he regarded
his treasure with longing eyes was constrained to answer especially
as the venerable father took a part in the interrogatories with an
interest too imposing to be denied nor did the scout fail to throw in
a pertinent inquiry whenever a fitting occasion presented in this
manner though with frequent interruptions which were filled with
certain threatening sounds from the recovered instrument the pursuers
were put in possession of such leading circumstances as were likely to
prove useful in accomplishing their great and engrossing object the
recovery of the sisters the narrative of david was simple and the
facts but few

magua had waited on the mountain until a safe moment to retire presented
itself when he had descended and taken the route along the western
side of the horican in direction of the canadas as the subtle huron was
familiar with the paths and well knew there was no immediate danger of
pursuit their progress had been moderate and far from fatiguing
it appeared from the unembellished statement of david that his own
presence had been rather endured than desired though even magua had not
been entirely exempt from that veneration with which the indians regard
those whom the great spirit had visited in their intellects at night
the utmost care had been taken of the captives both to prevent injury
from the damps of the woods and to guard against an escape at
the spring the horses were turned loose as has been seen and
notwithstanding the remoteness and length of their trail the artifices
already named were resorted to in order to cut off every clue to their
place of retreat on their arrival at the encampment of his people
magua in obedience to a policy seldom departed from separated his
prisoners cora had been sent to a tribe that temporarily occupied an
adjacent valley though david was far too ignorant of the customs and
history of the natives to be able to declare anything satisfactory
concerning their name or character he only knew that they had not
engaged in the late expedition against william henry that like the
hurons themselves they were allies of montcalm and that they maintained
an amicable though a watchful intercourse with the warlike and
savage people whom chance had for a time brought in such close and
disagreeable contact with themselves

the mohicans and the scout listened to his interrupted and imperfect
narrative with an interest that obviously increased as he proceeded
and it was while attempting to explain the pursuits of the community in
which cora was detained that the latter abruptly demanded

did you see the fashion of their knives were they of english or french
formation

my thoughts were bent on no such vanities but rather mingled in
consolation with those of the maidens

the time may come when you will not consider the knife of a savage such
a despicable vanity returned the scout with a strong expression of
contempt for the other's dullness had they held their corn feast or
can you say anything of the totems of the tribe

of corn we had many and plentiful feasts for the grain being in
the milk is both sweet to the mouth and comfortable to the stomach of
totem i know not the meaning but if it appertaineth in any wise to the
art of indian music it need not be inquired after at their hands they
never join their voices in praise and it would seem that they are among
the profanest of the idolatrous

therein you belie the natur of an indian even the mingo adores but
the true and loving god tis wicked fabrication of the whites and i
say it to the shame of my color that would make the warrior bow down
before images of his own creation it is true they endeavor to make
truces to the wicked one as who would not with an enemy he cannot
conquer but they look up for favor and assistance to the great and good
spirit only

it may be so said david but i have seen strange and fantastic
images drawn in their paint of which their admiration and care savored
of spiritual pride especially one and that too a foul and loathsome
object

was it a sarpent quickly demanded the scout

much the same it was in the likeness of an abject and creeping
tortoise

hugh exclaimed both the attentive mohicans in a breath while the
scout shook his head with the air of one who had made an important but
by no means a pleasing discovery then the father spoke in the language
of the delawares and with a calmness and dignity that instantly
arrested the attention even of those to whom his words were
unintelligible his gestures were impressive and at times energetic
once he lifted his arm on high and as it descended the action threw
aside the folds of his light mantle a finger resting on his breast as
if he would enforce his meaning by the attitude duncan's eyes followed
the movement and he perceived that the animal just mentioned was
beautifully though faintly worked in blue tint on the swarthy breast
of the chief all that he had ever heard of the violent separation of
the vast tribes of the delawares rushed across his mind and he awaited
the proper moment to speak with a suspense that was rendered nearly
intolerable by his interest in the stake his wish however was
anticipated by the scout who turned from his red friend saying

we have found that which may be good or evil to us as heaven disposes
the sagamore is of the high blood of the delawares and is the great
chief of their tortoises that some of this stock are among the people
of whom the singer tells us is plain by his words and had he but
spent half the breath in prudent questions that he has blown away in
making a trumpet of his throat we might have known how many warriors
they numbered it is altogether a dangerous path we move in for a
friend whose face is turned from you often bears a bloodier mind than
the enemy who seeks your scalp

explain said duncan

tis a long and melancholy tradition and one i little like to think
of for it is not to be denied that the evil has been mainly done by men
with white skins but it has ended in turning the tomahawk of brother
against brother and brought the mingo and the delaware to travel in the
same path

you then suspect it is a portion of that people among whom cora
resides

the scout nodded his head in assent though he seemed anxious to waive
the further discussion of a subject that appeared painful the impatient
duncan now made several hasty and desperate propositions to attempt
the release of the sisters munro seemed to shake off his apathy and
listened to the wild schemes of the young man with a deference that his
gray hairs and reverend years should have denied but the scout after
suffering the ardor of the lover to expend itself a little found means
to convince him of the folly of precipitation in a manner that would
require their coolest judgment and utmost fortitude

it would be well he added to let this man go in again as usual
and for him to tarry in the lodges giving notice to the gentle ones of
our approach until we call him out by signal to consult you know the
cry of a crow friend from the whistle of the whip-poor-will

tis a pleasing bird returned david and has a soft and melancholy
note though the time is rather quick and ill-measured

he speaks of the wish-ton-wish said the scout well since you like
his whistle it shall be your signal remember then when you hear the
whip-poor-will's call three times repeated you are to come into the
bushes where the bird might be supposed 

stop interrupted heyward i will accompany him

you exclaimed the astonished hawkeye are you tired of seeing the
sun rise and set

david is a living proof that the hurons can be merciful

ay but david can use his throat as no man in his senses would pervart
the gift

i too can play the madman the fool the hero in short any or
everything to rescue her i love name your objections no longer i am
resolved

hawkeye regarded the young man a moment in speechless amazement
but duncan who in deference to the other's skill and services had
hitherto submitted somewhat implicitly to his dictation now assumed the
superior with a manner that was not easily resisted he waved his hand
in sign of his dislike to all remonstrance and then in more tempered
language he continued

you have the means of disguise change me paint me too if you will
in short alter me to anything a fool

it is not for one like me to say that he who is already formed by so
powerful a hand as providence stands in need of a change muttered the
discontented scout when you send your parties abroad in war you find
it prudent at least to arrange the marks and places of encampment in
order that they who fight on your side may know when and where to expect
a friend

listen interrupted duncan you have heard from this faithful
follower of the captives that the indians are of two tribes if not
of different nations with one whom you think to be a branch of the
delawares is she you call the dark-hair the other and younger
of the ladies is undeniably with our declared enemies the hurons it
becomes my youth and rank to attempt the latter adventure while you
therefore are negotiating with your friends for the release of one of
the sisters i will effect that of the other or die

the awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes and his
form became imposing under its influence hawkeye though too much
accustomed to indian artifices not to foresee the danger of the
experiment knew not well how to combat this sudden resolution

perhaps there was something in the proposal that suited his own hardy
nature and that secret love of desperate adventure which had increased
with his experience until hazard and danger had become in some
measure necessary to the enjoyment of his existence instead of
continuing to oppose the scheme of duncan his humor suddenly altered
and he lent himself to its execution

come he said with a good-humored smile the buck that will take
to the water must be headed and not followed chingachgook has as many
different paints as the engineer officer's wife who takes down natur
on scraps of paper making the mountains look like cocks of rusty hay
and placing the blue sky in reach of your hand the sagamore can use
them too seat yourself on the log and my life on it he can soon make
a natural fool of you and that well to your liking

duncan complied and the mohican who had been an attentive listener to
the discourse readily undertook the office long practised in all the
subtle arts of his race he drew with great dexterity and quickness
the fantastic shadow that the natives were accustomed to consider as the
evidence of a friendly and jocular disposition every line that could
possibly be interpreted into a secret inclination for war was carefully
avoided while on the other hand he studied those conceits that might
be construed into amity

in short he entirely sacrificed every appearance of the warrior to the
masquerade of a buffoon such exhibitions were not uncommon among the
indians and as duncan was already sufficiently disguised in his dress
there certainly did exist some reason for believing that with his
knowledge of french he might pass for a juggler from ticonderoga
straggling among the allied and friendly tribes

when he was thought to be sufficiently painted the scout gave him much
friendly advice concerted signals and appointed the place where they
should meet in the event of mutual success the parting between munro
and his young friend was more melancholy still the former submitted
to the separation with an indifference that his warm and honest nature
would never have permitted in a more healthful state of mind the scout
led heyward aside and acquainted him with his intention to leave the
veteran in some safe encampment in charge of chingachgook while he and
uncas pursued their inquires among the people they had reason to believe
were delawares then renewing his cautions and advice he concluded by
saying with a solemnity and warmth of feeling with which duncan was
deeply touched

and now god bless you you have shown a spirit that i like for it is
the gift of youth more especially one of warm blood and a stout heart
but believe the warning of a man who has reason to know all he says to
be true you will have occasion for your best manhood and for a sharper
wit than what is to be gathered in books afore you outdo the cunning or
get the better of the courage of a mingo god bless you if the hurons
master your scalp rely on the promise of one who has two stout warriors
to back him they shall pay for their victory with a life for every
hair it holds i say young gentleman may providence bless your
undertaking which is altogether for good and remember that to outwit
the knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be naturally the
gift of a white-skin

duncan shook his worthy and reluctant associate warmly by the hand once
more recommended his aged friend to his care and returning his good
wishes he motioned to david to proceed hawkeye gazed after the
high-spirited and adventurous young man for several moments in open
admiration then shaking his head doubtingly he turned and led his
own division of the party into the concealment of the forest

the route taken by duncan and david lay directly across the clearing of
the beavers and along the margin of their pond

when the former found himself alone with one so simple and so little
qualified to render any assistance in desperate emergencies he first
began to be sensible of the difficulties of the task he had undertaken
the fading light increased the gloominess of the bleak and savage
wilderness that stretched so far on every side of him and there was
even a fearful character in the stillness of those little huts that
he knew were so abundantly peopled it struck him as he gazed at the
admirable structures and the wonderful precautions of their sagacious
inmates that even the brutes of these vast wilds were possessed of
an instinct nearly commensurate with his own reason and he could not
reflect without anxiety on the unequal contest that he had so rashly
courted then came the glowing image of alice her distress her actual
danger and all the peril of his situation was forgotten cheering
david he moved on with the light and vigorous step of youth and
enterprise

after making nearly a semicircle around the pond they diverged from the
water-course and began to ascend to the level of a slight elevation in
that bottom land over which they journeyed within half an hour they
gained the margin of another opening that bore all the signs of having
been also made by the beavers and which those sagacious animals had
probably been induced by some accident to abandon for the more
eligible position they now occupied a very natural sensation caused
duncan to hesitate a moment unwilling to leave the cover of their
bushy path as a man pauses to collect his energies before he essays any
hazardous experiment in which he is secretly conscious they will all be
needed he profited by the halt to gather such information as might be
obtained from his short and hasty glances

on the opposite side of the clearing and near the point where the brook
tumbled over some rocks from a still higher level some fifty or sixty
lodges rudely fabricated of logs brush and earth intermingled were
to be discovered they were arranged without any order and seemed to be
constructed with very little attention to neatness or beauty indeed
so very inferior were they in the two latter particulars to the village
duncan had just seen that he began to expect a second surprise no
less astonishing that the former this expectation was in no degree
diminished when by the doubtful twilight he beheld twenty or thirty
forms rising alternately from the cover of the tall coarse grass in
front of the lodges and then sinking again from the sight as it were
to burrow in the earth by the sudden and hasty glimpses that he caught
of these figures they seemed more like dark glancing specters or some
other unearthly beings than creatures fashioned with the ordinary and
vulgar materials of flesh and blood a gaunt naked form was seen for a
single instant tossing its arms wildly in the air and then the spot it
had filled was vacant the figure appearing suddenly in some other
and distant place or being succeeded by another possessing the same
mysterious character david observing that his companion lingered
pursued the direction of his gaze and in some measure recalled the
recollection of heyward by speaking

there is much fruitful soil uncultivated here he said and i may
add without the sinful leaven of self-commendation that since my
short sojourn in these heathenish abodes much good seed has been
scattered by the wayside

the tribes are fonder of the chase than of the arts of men of labor
returned the unconscious duncan still gazing at the objects of his
wonder

it is rather joy than labor to the spirit to lift up the voice in
praise but sadly do these boys abuse their gifts rarely have i found
any of their age on whom nature has so freely bestowed the elements
of psalmody and surely surely there are none who neglect them more
three nights have i now tarried here and three several times have i
assembled the urchins to join in sacred song and as often have they
responded to my efforts with whoopings and howlings that have chilled my
soul

of whom speak you

of those children of the devil who waste the precious moments in
yonder idle antics ah the wholesome restraint of discipline is but
little known among this self-abandoned people in a country of birches
a rod is never seen and it ought not to appear a marvel in my eyes
that the choicest blessings of providence are wasted in such cries as
these

david closed his ears against the juvenile pack whose yell just then
rang shrilly through the forest and duncan suffering his lip to curl
as in mockery of his own superstition said firmly

we will proceed

without removing the safeguards form his ears the master of song
complied and together they pursued their way toward what david was
sometimes wont to call the tents of the philistines




chapter 

 but though the beast of game
 the privilege of chase may claim
 though space and law the stag we lend
 ere hound we slip or bow we bend
 whoever recked where how or when
 the prowling fox was trapped or slain
 lady of the lake

it is unusual to find an encampment of the natives like those of the
more instructed whites guarded by the presence of armed men well
informed of the approach of every danger while it is yet at a distance
the indian generally rests secure under his knowledge of the signs of
the forest and the long and difficult paths that separate him from
those he has most reason to dread but the enemy who by any lucky
concurrence of accidents has found means to elude the vigilance of the
scouts will seldom meet with sentinels nearer home to sound the alarm
in addition to this general usage the tribes friendly to the french
knew too well the weight of the blow that had just been struck to
apprehend any immediate danger from the hostile nations that were
tributary to the crown of britain

when duncan and david therefore found themselves in the center of the
children who played the antics already mentioned it was without the
least previous intimation of their approach but so soon as they were
observed the whole of the juvenile pack raised by common consent a
shrill and warning whoop and then sank as it were by magic from
before the sight of their visitors the naked tawny bodies of the
crouching urchins blended so nicely at that hour with the withered
herbage that at first it seemed as if the earth had in truth
swallowed up their forms though when surprise permitted duncan to bend
his look more curiously about the spot he found it everywhere met by
dark quick and rolling eyeballs

gathering no encouragement from this startling presage of the nature of
the scrutiny he was likely to undergo from the more mature judgments
of the men there was an instant when the young soldier would have
retreated it was however too late to appear to hesitate the cry
of the children had drawn a dozen warriors to the door of the nearest
lodge where they stood clustered in a dark and savage group gravely
awaiting the nearer approach of those who had unexpectedly come among
them

david in some measure familiarized to the scene led the way with a
steadiness that no slight obstacle was likely to disconcert into this
very building it was the principal edifice of the village though
roughly constructed of the bark and branches of trees being the lodge
in which the tribe held its councils and public meetings during their
temporary residence on the borders of the english province duncan found
it difficult to assume the necessary appearance of unconcern as he
brushed the dark and powerful frames of the savages who thronged its
threshold but conscious that his existence depended on his presence of
mind he trusted to the discretion of his companion whose footsteps he
closely followed endeavoring as he proceeded to rally his thoughts
for the occasion his blood curdled when he found himself in absolute
contact with such fierce and implacable enemies but he so far mastered
his feelings as to pursue his way into the center of the lodge with an
exterior that did not betray the weakness imitating the example of the
deliberate gamut he drew a bundle of fragrant brush from beneath a pile
that filled the corner of the hut and seated himself in silence

so soon as their visitor had passed the observant warriors fell back
from the entrance and arranging themselves about him they seemed
patiently to await the moment when it might comport with the dignity of
the stranger to speak by far the greater number stood leaning in lazy
lounging attitudes against the upright posts that supported the crazy
building while three or four of the oldest and most distinguished of
the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance

a flaring torch was burning in the place and set its red glare from
face to face and figure to figure as it waved in the currents of air
duncan profited by its light to read the probable character of his
reception in the countenances of his hosts but his ingenuity availed
him little against the cold artifices of the people he had encountered
the chiefs in front scarce cast a glance at his person keeping their
eyes on the ground with an air that might have been intended for
respect but which it was quite easy to construe into distrust the men
in the shadow were less reserved duncan soon detected their searching
but stolen looks which in truth scanned his person and attire inch by
inch leaving no emotion of the countenance no gesture no line of the
paint nor even the fashion of a garment unheeded and without comment

at length one whose hair was beginning to be sprinkled with gray but
whose sinewy limbs and firm tread announced that he was still equal to
the duties of manhood advanced out of the gloom of a corner whither he
had probably posted himself to make his observations unseen and
spoke he used the language of the wyandots or hurons his words were
consequently unintelligible to heyward though they seemed by the
gestures that accompanied them to be uttered more in courtesy than
anger the latter shook his head and made a gesture indicative of his
inability to reply

do none of my brothers speak the french or the english he said in
the former language looking about him from countenance to countenance
in hopes of finding a nod of assent

though more than one had turned as if to catch the meaning of his
words they remained unanswered

i should be grieved to think continued duncan speaking slowly and
using the simplest french of which he was the master to believe that
none of this wise and brave nation understand the language that the
grand monarque uses when he talks to his children his heart would be
heavy did he believe his red warriors paid him so little respect

a long and grave pause succeeded during which no movement of a limb
nor any expression of an eye betrayed the expression produced by his
remark duncan who knew that silence was a virtue among his hosts
gladly had recourse to the custom in order to arrange his ideas at
length the same warrior who had before addressed him replied by dryly
demanding in the language of the canadas

when our great father speaks to his people is it with the tongue of a
huron

he knows no difference in his children whether the color of the skin
be red or black or white returned duncan evasively though chiefly
is he satisfied with the brave hurons

in what manner will he speak demanded the wary chief when the
runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on the heads
of the yengeese

they were his enemies said duncan shuddering involuntarily and
doubtless he will say it is good my hurons are very gallant

our canada father does not think it instead of looking forward to
reward his indians his eyes are turned backward he sees the dead
yengeese but no huron what can this mean

a great chief like him has more thoughts than tongues he looks to
see that no enemies are on his trail

the canoe of a dead warrior will not float on the horican returned
the savage gloomily his ears are open to the delawares who are not
our friends and they fill them with lies

it cannot be see he has bid me who am a man that knows the art of
healing to go to his children the red hurons of the great lakes and
ask if any are sick

another silence succeeded this annunciation of the character duncan
had assumed every eye was simultaneously bent on his person as if
to inquire into the truth or falsehood of the declaration with an
intelligence and keenness that caused the subject of their scrutiny to
tremble for the result he was however relieved again by the former
speaker

do the cunning men of the canadas paint their skins the huron coldly
continued we have heard them boast that their faces were pale

when an indian chief comes among his white fathers returned duncan
with great steadiness he lays aside his buffalo robe to carry the
shirt that is offered him my brothers have given me paint and i wear
it

a low murmur of applause announced that the compliment of the tribe was
favorably received the elderly chief made a gesture of commendation
which was answered by most of his companions who each threw forth
a hand and uttered a brief exclamation of pleasure duncan began to
breathe more freely believing that the weight of his examination was
past and as he had already prepared a simple and probable tale to
support his pretended occupation his hopes of ultimate success grew
brighter

after a silence of a few moments as if adjusting his thoughts in
order to make a suitable answer to the declaration their guests had
just given another warrior arose and placed himself in an attitude to
speak while his lips were yet in the act of parting a low but fearful
sound arose from the forest and was immediately succeeded by a high
shrill yell that was drawn out until it equaled the longest and most
plaintive howl of the wolf the sudden and terrible interruption caused
duncan to start from his seat unconscious of everything but the effect
produced by so frightful a cry at the same moment the warriors glided
in a body from the lodge and the outer air was filled with loud shouts
that nearly drowned those awful sounds which were still ringing beneath
the arches of the woods unable to command himself any longer the youth
broke from the place and presently stood in the center of a disorderly
throng that included nearly everything having life within the limits
of the encampment men women and children the aged the inform the
active and the strong were alike abroad some exclaiming aloud others
clapping their hands with a joy that seemed frantic and all expressing
their savage pleasure in some unexpected event though astounded at
first by the uproar heyward was soon enabled to find its solution by
the scene that followed

there yet lingered sufficient light in the heavens to exhibit those
bright openings among the tree-tops where different paths left the
clearing to enter the depths of the wilderness beneath one of them a
line of warriors issued from the woods and advanced slowly toward the
dwellings one in front bore a short pole on which as it afterwards
appeared were suspended several human scalps the startling sounds that
duncan had heard were what the whites have not inappropriately called
the death-hallo and each repetition of the cry was intended to
announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy thus far the knowledge of
heyward assisted him in the explanation and as he now knew that the
interruption was caused by the unlooked-for return of a successful
war-party every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward
congratulation for the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred
on himself

when at the distance of a few hundred feet from the lodges the newly
arrived warriors halted their plaintive and terrific cry which was
intended to represent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph
to the victors had entirely ceased one of their number now called
aloud in words that were far from appalling though not more
intelligible to those for whose ears they were intended than their
expressive yells it would be difficult to convey a suitable idea of the
savage ecstasy with which the news thus imparted was received the whole
encampment in a moment became a scene of the most violent bustle and
commotion the warriors drew their knives and flourishing them they
arranged themselves in two lines forming a lane that extended from
the war-party to the lodges the squaws seized clubs axes or whatever
weapon of offense first offered itself to their hands and rushed
eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that was at hand even
the children would not be excluded but boys little able to wield the
instruments tore the tomahawks from the belts of their fathers and
stole into the ranks apt imitators of the savage traits exhibited by
their parents

large piles of brush lay scattered about the clearing and a wary and
aged squaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the
coming exhibition as the flame arose its power exceeded that of
the parting day and assisted to render objects at the same time more
distinct and more hideous the whole scene formed a striking picture
whose frame was composed of the dark and tall border of pines the
warriors just arrived were the most distant figures a little in advance
stood two men who were apparently selected from the rest as the
principal actors in what was to follow the light was not strong enough
to render their features distinct though it was quite evident that
they were governed by very different emotions while one stood erect and
firm prepared to meet his fate like a hero the other bowed his head
as if palsied by terror or stricken with shame the high-spirited duncan
felt a powerful impulse of admiration and pity toward the former though
no opportunity could offer to exhibit his generous emotions he watched
his slightest movement however with eager eyes and as he traced
the fine outline of his admirably proportioned and active frame he
endeavored to persuade himself that if the powers of man seconded
by such noble resolution could bear one harmless through so severe a
trial the youthful captive before him might hope for success in the
hazardous race he was about to run insensibly the young man drew nigher
to the swarthy lines of the hurons and scarcely breathed so intense
became his interest in the spectacle just then the signal yell was
given and the momentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by a
burst of cries that far exceeded any before heard the more abject of
the two victims continued motionless but the other bounded from the
place at the cry with the activity and swiftness of a deer instead of
rushing through the hostile lines as had been expected he just entered
the dangerous defile and before time was given for a single blow
turned short and leaping the heads of a row of children he gained at
once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array the artifice
was answered by a hundred voices raised in imprecations and the whole
of the excited multitude broke from their order and spread themselves
about the place in wild confusion

a dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid brightness on the place
which resembled some unhallowed and supernatural arena in which
malicious demons had assembled to act their bloody and lawless rites
the forms in the background looked like unearthly beings gliding before
the eye and cleaving the air with frantic and unmeaning gestures while
the savage passions of such as passed the flames were rendered fearfully
distinct by the gleams that shot athwart their inflamed visages

it will easily be understood that amid such a concourse of vindictive
enemies no breathing time was allowed the fugitive there was a single
moment when it seemed as if he would have reached the forest but the
whole body of his captors threw themselves before him and drove him
back into the center of his relentless persecutors turning like a
headed deer he shot with the swiftness of an arrow through a pillar
of forked flame and passing the whole multitude harmless he appeared
on the opposite side of the clearing here too he was met and turned
by a few of the older and more subtle of the hurons once more he tried
the throng as if seeking safety in its blindness and then several
moments succeeded during which duncan believed the active and
courageous young stranger was lost

nothing could be distinguished but a dark mass of human forms tossed
and involved in inexplicable confusion arms gleaming knives and
formidable clubs appeared above them but the blows were evidently
given at random the awful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks
of the women and the fierce yells of the warriors now and then duncan
caught a glimpse of a light form cleaving the air in some desperate
bound and he rather hoped than believed that the captive yet retained
the command of his astonishing powers of activity suddenly the
multitude rolled backward and approached the spot where he himself
stood the heavy body in the rear pressed upon the women and children
in front and bore them to the earth the stranger reappeared in the
confusion human power could not however much longer endure so
severe a trial of this the captive seemed conscious profiting by
the momentary opening he darted from among the warriors and made a
desperate and what seemed to duncan a final effort to gain the wood
as if aware that no danger was to be apprehended from the young soldier
the fugitive nearly brushed his person in his flight a tall and
powerful huron who had husbanded his forces pressed close upon his
heels and with an uplifted arm menaced a fatal blow duncan thrust
forth a foot and the shock precipitated the eager savage headlong many
feet in advance of his intended victim thought itself is not quicker
than was the motion with which the latter profited by the advantage he
turned gleamed like a meteor again before the eyes of duncan and at
the next moment when the latter recovered his recollection and gazed
around in quest of the captive he saw him quietly leaning against a
small painted post which stood before the door of the principal lodge

apprehensive that the part he had taken in the escape might prove fatal
to himself duncan left the place without delay he followed the crowd
which drew nigh the lodges gloomy and sullen like any other multitude
that had been disappointed in an execution curiosity or perhaps a
better feeling induced him to approach the stranger he found him
standing with one arm cast about the protecting post and breathing
thick and hard after his exertions but disdaining to permit a single
sign of suffering to escape his person was now protected by immemorial
and sacred usage until the tribe in council had deliberated and
determined on his fate it was not difficult however to foretell the
result if any presage could be drawn from the feelings of those who
crowded the place

there was no term of abuse known to the huron vocabulary that the
disappointed women did not lavishly expend on the successful stranger
they flouted at his efforts and told him with bitter scoffs that his
feet were better than his hands and that he merited wings while he
knew not the use of an arrow or a knife to all this the captive made
no reply but was content to preserve an attitude in which dignity was
singularly blended with disdain exasperated as much by his composure
as by his good-fortune their words became unintelligible and were
succeeded by shrill piercing yells just then the crafty squaw who had
taken the necessary precaution to fire the piles made her way through
the throng and cleared a place for herself in front of the captive the
squalid and withered person of this hag might well have obtained for her
the character of possessing more than human cunning throwing back her
light vestment she stretched forth her long skinny arm in derision
and using the language of the lenape as more intelligible to the
subject of her gibes she commenced aloud

look you delaware she said snapping her fingers in his face your
nation is a race of women and the hoe is better fitted to your hands
than the gun your squaws are the mothers of deer but if a bear or
a wildcat or a serpent were born among you ye would flee the huron
girls shall make you petticoats and we will find you a husband

a burst of savage laughter succeeded this attack during which the soft
and musical merriment of the younger females strangely chimed with
the cracked voice of their older and more malignant companion but the
stranger was superior to all their efforts his head was immovable nor
did he betray the slightest consciousness that any were present except
when his haughty eye rolled toward the dusky forms of the warriors who
stalked in the background silent and sullen observers of the scene

infuriated at the self-command of the captive the woman placed her arms
akimbo and throwing herself into a posture of defiance she broke
out anew in a torrent of words that no art of ours could commit
successfully to paper her breath was however expended in vain for
although distinguished in her nation as a proficient in the art of
abuse she was permitted to work herself into such a fury as actually to
foam at the mouth without causing a muscle to vibrate in the motionless
figure of the stranger the effect of his indifference began to extend
itself to the other spectators and a youngster who was just quitting
the condition of a boy to enter the state of manhood attempted to
assist the termagant by flourishing his tomahawk before their victim
and adding his empty boasts to the taunts of the women then indeed
the captive turned his face toward the light and looked down on the
stripling with an expression that was superior to contempt at the next
moment he resumed his quiet and reclining attitude against the post but
the change of posture had permitted duncan to exchange glances with the
firm and piercing eyes of uncas

breathless with amazement and heavily oppressed with the critical
situation of his friend heyward recoiled before the look trembling
lest its meaning might in some unknown manner hasten the prisoner's
fate there was not however any instant cause for such an
apprehension just then a warrior forced his way into the exasperated
crowd motioning the women and children aside with a stern gesture he
took uncas by the arm and led him toward the door of the council-lodge
thither all the chiefs and most of the distinguished warriors
followed among whom the anxious heyward found means to enter without
attracting any dangerous attention to himself

a few minutes were consumed in disposing of those present in a manner
suitable to their rank and influence in the tribe an order very similar
to that adopted in the preceding interview was observed the aged and
superior chiefs occupying the area of the spacious apartment within
the powerful light of a glaring torch while their juniors and inferiors
were arranged in the background presenting a dark outline of swarthy
and marked visages in the very center of the lodge immediately under
an opening that admitted the twinkling light of one or two stars stood
uncas calm elevated and collected his high and haughty carriage was
not lost on his captors who often bent their looks on his person with
eyes which while they lost none of their inflexibility of purpose
plainly betrayed their admiration of the stranger's daring

the case was different with the individual whom duncan had observed to
stand forth with his friend previously to the desperate trial of speed
and who instead of joining in the chase had remained throughout
its turbulent uproar like a cringing statue expressive of shame and
disgrace though not a hand had been extended to greet him nor yet an
eye had condescended to watch his movements he had also entered the
lodge as though impelled by a fate to whose decrees he submitted
seemingly without a struggle heyward profited by the first opportunity
to gaze in his face secretly apprehensive he might find the features
of another acquaintance but they proved to be those of a stranger and
what was still more inexplicable of one who bore all the distinctive
marks of a huron warrior instead of mingling with his tribe however
he sat apart a solitary being in a multitude his form shrinking into a
crouching and abject attitude as if anxious to fill as little space as
possible when each individual had taken his proper station and silence
reigned in the place the gray-haired chief already introduced to the
reader spoke aloud in the language of the lenni lenape

delaware he said though one of a nation of women you have proved
yourself a man i would give you food but he who eats with a huron
should become his friend rest in peace till the morning sun when our
last words shall be spoken

seven nights and as many summer days have i fasted on the trail of
the hurons uncas coldly replied the children of the lenape know how
to travel the path of the just without lingering to eat

two of my young men are in pursuit of your companion resumed the
other without appearing to regard the boast of his captive when they
get back then will our wise man say to you live or die

has a huron no ears scornfully exclaimed uncas twice since he has
been your prisoner has the delaware heard a gun that he knows your
young men will never come back

a short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion duncan who
understood the mohican to allude to the fatal rifle of the scout bent
forward in earnest observation of the effect it might produce on the
conquerors but the chief was content with simply retorting

if the lenape are so skillful why is one of their bravest warriors
here

he followed in the steps of a flying coward and fell into a snare the
cunning beaver may be caught

as uncas thus replied he pointed with his finger toward the solitary
huron but without deigning to bestow any other notice on so unworthy
an object the words of the answer and the air of the speaker produced
a strong sensation among his auditors every eye rolled sullenly toward
the individual indicated by the simple gesture and a low threatening
murmur passed through the crowd the ominous sounds reached the outer
door and the women and children pressing into the throng no gap had
been left between shoulder and shoulder that was not now filled with
the dark lineaments of some eager and curious human countenance

in the meantime the more aged chiefs in the center communed with each
other in short and broken sentences not a word was uttered that did not
convey the meaning of the speaker in the simplest and most energetic
form again a long and deeply solemn pause took place it was known
by all present to be the brave precursor of a weighty and important
judgment they who composed the outer circle of faces were on tiptoe to
gaze and even the culprit for an instant forgot his shame in a deeper
emotion and exposed his abject features in order to cast an anxious
and troubled glance at the dark assemblage of chiefs the silence was
finally broken by the aged warrior so often named he arose from the
earth and moving past the immovable form of uncas placed himself in
a dignified attitude before the offender at that moment the withered
squaw already mentioned moved into the circle in a slow sidling sort
of a dance holding the torch and muttering the indistinct words of
what might have been a species of incantation though her presence was
altogether an intrusion it was unheeded

approaching uncas she held the blazing brand in such a manner as to
cast its red glare on his person and to expose the slightest emotion of
his countenance the mohican maintained his firm and haughty attitude
and his eyes so far from deigning to meet her inquisitive look dwelt
steadily on the distance as though it penetrated the obstacles
which impeded the view and looked into futurity satisfied with her
examination she left him with a slight expression of pleasure and
proceeded to practise the same trying experiment on her delinquent
countryman

the young huron was in his war paint and very little of a finely molded
form was concealed by his attire the light rendered every limb and
joint discernible and duncan turned away in horror when he saw they
were writhing in irrepressible agony the woman was commencing a low
and plaintive howl at the sad and shameful spectacle when the chief put
forth his hand and gently pushed her aside

reed-that-bends he said addressing the young culprit by name and in
his proper language though the great spirit has made you pleasant to
the eyes it would have been better that you had not been born your
tongue is loud in the village but in battle it is still none of my
young men strike the tomahawk deeper into the war-post none of them so
lightly on the yengeese the enemy know the shape of your back but they
have never seen the color of your eyes three times have they called on
you to come and as often did you forget to answer your name will never
be mentioned again in your tribe it is already forgotten

as the chief slowly uttered these words pausing impressively between
each sentence the culprit raised his face in deference to the other's
rank and years shame horror and pride struggled in its lineaments
his eye which was contracted with inward anguish gleamed on the
persons of those whose breath was his fame and the latter emotion for
an instant predominated he arose to his feet and baring his bosom
looked steadily on the keen glittering knife that was already upheld
by his inexorable judge as the weapon passed slowly into his heart he
even smiled as if in joy at having found death less dreadful than he
had anticipated and fell heavily on his face at the feet of the rigid
and unyielding form of uncas

the squaw gave a loud and plaintive yell dashed the torch to the
earth and buried everything in darkness the whole shuddering group
of spectators glided from the lodge like troubled sprites and duncan
thought that he and the yet throbbing body of the victim of an indian
judgment had now become its only tenants




chapter 

 thus spoke the sage the kings without delay
 dissolve the council and their chief obey
 pope's iliad

a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a
hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice
of uncas muttered in his ear

the hurons are dogs the sight of a coward's blood can never make a
warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe and the
rifle of hawkeye is not asleep go uncas and the open hand are now
strangers it is enough

heyward would gladly have heard more but a gentle push from his friend
urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might
attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly
yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the
throng that hovered nigh the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and
uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to
and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the
lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas still maintaining its upright
attitude near the dead body of the huron

a knot of warriors soon entered the place again and reissuing
they bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods after this
termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned
and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he
incurred the risk he ran in the present temper of the tribe it would
have been easy to have fled and rejoined his companions had such a
wish crossed his mind but in addition to the never-ceasing anxiety on
account of alice a fresher though feebler interest in the fate of uncas
assisted to chain him to the spot he continued therefore to stray
from hut to hut looking into each only to encounter additional
disappointment until he had made the entire circuit of the village
abandoning a species of inquiry that proved so fruitless he retraced
his steps to the council-lodge resolved to seek and question david in
order to put an end to his doubts

on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment
and the place of execution the young man found that the excitement
had already subsided the warriors had reassembled and were now calmly
smoking while they conversed gravely on the chief incidents of their
recent expedition to the head of the horican though the return of
duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious
circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far
the terrible scene that had just occurred proved favorable to his views
and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him
of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage

without seeming to hesitate he walked into the lodge and took his seat
with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts
a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas
still remained where he had left him david had not reappeared no other
restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young
huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned
against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway in every
other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from
all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air
of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition

heyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instance of the prompt
punishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen to hazard an
exposure by any officious boldness he would greatly have preferred
silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real
condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent
resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed he had not
long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another
of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him

my canada father does not forget his children said the chief i
thank him an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men can
the cunning stranger frighten him away

heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the
indians in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance
that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own
ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have
uttered a proposal that would have given him more satisfaction aware
of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character
however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery

spirits differ some yield to the power of wisdom while others are too
strong

my brother is a great medicine said the cunning savage he will
try

a gesture of assent was the answer the huron was content with the
assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to
move the impatient heyward inwardly execrating the cold customs of
the savages which required such sacrifices to appearance was fain to
assume an air of indifference equal to that maintained by the chief
who was in truth a near relative of the afflicted woman the minutes
lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in
empiricism when the huron laid aside his pipe and drew his robe across
his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid
just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking
silently among the attentive group he seated himself on one end of the
low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient
look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable
horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua

the sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the
departure of the huron several pipes that had been extinguished were
lighted again while the newcomer without speaking a word drew his
tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to
inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle with as much
indifference as if he had not been absent two weary days on a long and
toilsome hunt ten minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might
have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a
cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke

welcome one at length uttered has my friend found the moose

the young men stagger under their burdens returned magua let
reed-that-bends go on the hunting path he will meet them

a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
each pipe dropped from the lips of its owner as though all had inhaled
an impurity at the same instant the smoke wreathed above their heads in
little eddies and curling in a spiral form it ascended swiftly through
the opening in the roof of the lodge leaving the place beneath clear of
its fumes and each dark visage distinctly visible the looks of most of
the warriors were riveted on the earth though a few of the younger and
less gifted of the party suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to
roll in the direction of a white-headed savage who sat between two of
the most venerated chiefs of the tribe there was nothing in the air
or attire of this indian that would seem to entitle him to such a
distinction the former was rather depressed than remarkable for the
bearing of the natives and the latter was such as was commonly worn
by the ordinary men of the nation like most around him for more than
a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at
length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an
object of general attention then he arose and lifted his voice in the
general silence

it was a lie he said i had no son he who was called by that name
is forgotten his blood was pale and it came not from the veins of a
huron the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw the great spirit has said
that the family of wiss-entush should end he is happy who knows that
the evil of his race dies with himself i have done

the speaker who was the father of the recreant young indian looked
round and about him as if seeking commendation of his stoicism in the
eyes of the auditors but the stern customs of his people had made too
severe an exaction of the feeble old man the expression of his eye
contradicted his figurative and boastful language while every muscle in
his wrinkled visage was working with anguish standing a single minute
to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze
of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge
with the noiseless step of an indian seeking in the privacy of his own
abode the sympathy of one like himself aged forlorn and childless

the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and
defects in character suffered him to depart in silence then with an
elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society
might profitably emulate one of the chiefs drew the attention of the
young men from the weakness they had just witnessed by saying in a
cheerful voice addressing himself in courtesy to magua as the newest
comer

the delawares have been like bears after the honey pots prowling
around my village but who has ever found a huron asleep

the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder
was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed

the delawares of the lakes

not so they who wear the petticoats of squaws on their own river one
of them has been passing the tribe

did my young men take his scalp

his legs were good though his arm is better for the hoe than the
tomahawk returned the other pointing to the immovable form of uncas

instead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the
sight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to
hate magua continued to smoke with the meditative air that he usually
maintained when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his
eloquence although secretly amazed at the facts communicated by the
speech of the aged father he permitted himself to ask no questions
reserving his inquiries for a more suitable moment it was only after a
sufficient interval that he shook the ashes from his pipe replaced the
tomahawk tightened his girdle and arose casting for the first time a
glance in the direction of the prisoner who stood a little behind him
the wary though seemingly abstracted uncas caught a glimpse of the
movement and turning suddenly to the light their looks met near a
minute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another
steadily in the eye neither quailing in the least before the fierce
gaze he encountered the form of uncas dilated and his nostrils opened
like those of a tiger at bay but so rigid and unyielding was his
posture that he might easily have been converted by the imagination
into an exquisite and faultless representation of the warlike deity of
his tribe the lineaments of the quivering features of magua proved more
ductile his countenance gradually lost its character of defiance in an
expression of ferocious joy and heaving a breath from the very bottom
of his chest he pronounced aloud the formidable name of

le cerf agile

each warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the well-known
appellation and there was a short period during which the stoical
constancy of the natives was completely conquered by surprise the hated
and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice carrying the
sound even beyond the limits of the lodge the women and children who
lingered around the entrance took up the words in an echo which was
succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl the latter was not yet
ended when the sensation among the men had entirely abated each one in
presence seated himself as though ashamed of his precipitation but it
was many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll toward their
captive in curious examination of a warrior who had so often proved
his prowess on the best and proudest of their nation uncas enjoyed his
victory but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet
smile an emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation

magua caught the expression and raising his arm he shook it at the
captive the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling
with the trembling agitation of the limb as in a tone of vengeance he
exclaimed in english

mohican you die

the healing waters will never bring the dead hurons to life returned
uncas in the music of the delawares the tumbling river washes their
bones their men are squaws their women owls go call together the
huron dogs that they may look upon a warrior my nostrils are offended
they scent the blood of a coward

the latter allusion struck deep and the injury rankled many of the
hurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke among
which number was magua this cunning savage beheld and instantly
profited by his advantage dropping the light robe of skin from his
shoulder he stretched forth his arm and commenced a burst of his
dangerous and artful eloquence however much his influence among his
people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness as
well as by his desertion of the tribe his courage and his fame as an
orator were undeniable he never spoke without auditors and rarely
without making converts to his opinions on the present occasion his
native powers were stimulated by the thirst of revenge

he again recounted the events of the attack on the island at glenn's
the death of his associates and the escape of their most formidable
enemies then he described the nature and position of the mount whither
he had led such captives as had fallen into their hands of his own
bloody intentions toward the maidens and of his baffled malice he made
no mention but passed rapidly on to the surprise of the party by la
longue carabine and its fatal termination here he paused and looked
about him in affected veneration for the departed but in truth
to note the effect of his opening narrative as usual every eye was
riveted on his face each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue so
motionless was the posture so intense the attention of the individual

then magua dropped his voice which had hitherto been clear strong and
elevated and touched upon the merits of the dead no quality that was
likely to command the sympathy of an indian escaped his notice one
had never been known to follow the chase in vain another had been
indefatigable on the trail of their enemies this was brave that
generous in short he so managed his allusions that in a nation which
was composed of so few families he contrived to strike every chord that
might find in its turn some breast in which to vibrate

are the bones of my young men he concluded in the burial-place of
the hurons you know they are not their spirits are gone toward the
setting sun and are already crossing the great waters to the happy
hunting-grounds but they departed without food without guns or knives
without moccasins naked and poor as they were born shall this be
are their souls to enter the land of the just like hungry iroquois or
unmanly delawares or shall they meet their friends with arms in their
hands and robes on their backs what will our fathers think the tribes
of the wyandots have become they will look on their children with a
dark eye and say go a chippewa has come hither with the name of a
huron brothers we must not forget the dead a red-skin never ceases
to remember we will load the back of this mohican until he staggers
under our bounty and dispatch him after my young men they call to us
for aid though our ears are not open they say forget us not when
they see the spirit of this mohican toiling after them with his burden
they will know we are of that mind then will they go on happy and our
children will say so did our fathers to their friends so must we do
to them what is a yengee we have slain many but the earth is still
pale a stain on the name of huron can only be hid by blood that comes
from the veins of an indian let this delaware die

the effect of such an harangue delivered in the nervous language and
with the emphatic manner of a huron orator could scarcely be mistaken
magua had so artfully blended the natural sympathies with the religious
superstition of his auditors that their minds already prepared by
custom to sacrifice a victim to the manes of their countrymen lost
every vestige of humanity in a wish for revenge one warrior in
particular a man of wild and ferocious mien had been conspicuous for
the attention he had given to the words of the speaker his countenance
had changed with each passing emotion until it settled into a look
of deadly malice as magua ended he arose and uttering the yell of a
demon his polished little axe was seen glancing in the torchlight as
he whirled it above his head the motion and the cry were too sudden
for words to interrupt his bloody intention it appeared as if a bright
gleam shot from his hand which was crossed at the same moment by a
dark and powerful line the former was the tomahawk in its passage the
latter the arm that magua darted forward to divert its aim the quick
and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late the keen weapon
cut the war plume from the scalping tuft of uncas and passed through
the frail wall of the lodge as though it were hurled from some
formidable engine

duncan had seen the threatening action and sprang upon his feet with
a heart which while it leaped into his throat swelled with the most
generous resolution in behalf of his friend a glance told him that the
blow had failed and terror changed to admiration uncas stood still
looking his enemy in the eye with features that seemed superior to
emotion marble could not be colder calmer or steadier than the
countenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive attack then as if
pitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to himself he
smiled and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue

no said magua after satisfying himself of the safety of the captive
the sun must shine on his shame the squaws must see his flesh tremble
or our revenge will be like the play of boys go take him where there
is silence let us see if a delaware can sleep at night and in the
morning die

the young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instantly passed
their ligaments of bark across his arms and led him from the lodge
amid a profound and ominous silence it was only as the figure of uncas
stood in the opening of the door that his firm step hesitated there he
turned and in the sweeping and haughty glance that he threw around
the circle of his enemies duncan caught a look which he was glad to
construe into an expression that he was not entirely deserted by hope

magua was content with his success or too much occupied with his secret
purposes to push his inquiries any further shaking his mantle and
folding it on his bosom he also quitted the place without pursuing a
subject which might have proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow
notwithstanding his rising resentment his natural firmness and his
anxiety on behalf of uncas heyward felt sensibly relieved by the
absence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe the excitement produced
by the speech gradually subsided the warriors resumed their seats and
clouds of smoke once more filled the lodge for near half an hour not
a syllable was uttered or scarcely a look cast aside a grave and
meditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of
violence and commotion among these beings who were alike so impetuous
and yet so self-restrained

when the chief who had solicited the aid of duncan finished his pipe
he made a final and successful movement toward departing a motion of a
finger was the intimation he gave the supposed physician to follow and
passing through the clouds of smoke duncad was glad on more accounts
than one to be able at last to breathe the pure air of a cool and
refreshing summer evening

instead of pursuing his way among those lodges where heyward had already
made his unsuccessful search his companion turned aside and proceeded
directly toward the base of an adjacent mountain which overhung the
temporary village a thicket of brush skirted its foot and it became
necessary to proceed through a crooked and narrow path the boys had
resumed their sports in the clearing and were enacting a mimic chase
to the post among themselves in order to render their games as like the
reality as possible one of the boldest of their number had conveyed a
few brands into some piles of tree-tops that had hitherto escaped the
burning the blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the chief
and duncan and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude
scenery at a little distance from a bald rock and directly in its
front they entered a grassy opening which they prepared to cross just
then fresh fuel was added to the fire and a powerful light penetrated
even to that distant spot it fell upon the white surface of the
mountain and was reflected downward upon a dark and mysterious-looking
being that arose unexpectedly in their path the indian paused as if
doubtful whether to proceed and permitted his companion to approach his
side a large black ball which at first seemed stationary now began
to move in a manner that to the latter was inexplicable again the fire
brightened and its glare fell more distinctly on the object then even
duncan knew it by its restless and sidling attitudes which kept the
upper part of its form in constant motion while the animal itself
appeared seated to be a bear though it growled loudly and fiercely
and there were instants when its glistening eyeballs might be seen
it gave no other indications of hostility the huron at least seemed
assured that the intentions of this singular intruder were peaceable
for after giving it an attentive examination he quietly pursued his
course

duncan who knew that the animal was often domesticated among the
indians followed the example of his companion believing that some
favorite of the tribe had found its way into the thicket in search
of food they passed it unmolested though obliged to come nearly
in contact with the monster the huron who had at first so warily
determined the character of his strange visitor was now content with
proceeding without wasting a moment in further examination but heyward
was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward in salutary
watchfulness against attacks in the rear his uneasiness was in no
degree diminished when he perceived the beast rolling along their path
and following their footsteps he would have spoken but the indian at
that moment shoved aside a door of bark and entered a cavern in the
bosom of the mountain

profiting by so easy a method of retreat duncan stepped after him
and was gladly closing the slight cover to the opening when he felt it
drawn from his hand by the beast whose shaggy form immediately darkened
the passage they were now in a straight and long gallery in a chasm of
the rocks where retreat without encountering the animal was impossible
making the best of the circumstances the young man pressed forward
keeping as close as possible to his conductor the bear growled
frequently at his heels and once or twice its enormous paws were laid
on his person as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the
den

how long the nerves of heyward would have sustained him in this
extraordinary situation it might be difficult to decide for happily
he soon found relief a glimmer of light had constantly been in their
front and they now arrived at the place whence it proceeded

a large cavity in the rock had been rudely fitted to answer the purposes
of many apartments the subdivisions were simple but ingenious being
composed of stone sticks and bark intermingled openings above
admitted the light by day and at night fires and torches supplied the
place of the sun hither the hurons had brought most of their valuables
especially those which more particularly pertained to the nation and
hither as it now appeared the sick woman who was believed to be
the victim of supernatural power had been transported also under an
impression that her tormentor would find more difficulty in making his
assaults through walls of stone than through the leafy coverings of the
lodges the apartment into which duncan and his guide first entered had
been exclusively devoted to her accommodation the latter approached her
bedside which was surrounded by females in the center of whom heyward
was surprised to find his missing friend david

a single look was sufficient to apprise the pretended leech that the
invalid was far beyond his powers of healing she lay in a sort of
paralysis indifferent to the objects which crowded before her sight
and happily unconscious of suffering heyward was far from regretting
that his mummeries were to be performed on one who was much too ill
to take an interest in their failure or success the slight qualm
of conscience which had been excited by the intended deception was
instantly appeased and he began to collect his thoughts in order to
enact his part with suitable spirit when he found he was about to be
anticipated in his skill by an attempt to prove the power of music

gamut who had stood prepared to pour forth his spirit in song when the
visitors entered after delaying a moment drew a strain from his pipe
and commenced a hymn that might have worked a miracle had faith in its
efficacy been of much avail he was allowed to proceed to the close the
indians respecting his imaginary infirmity and duncan too glad of the
delay to hazard the slightest interruption as the dying cadence of
his strains was falling on the ears of the latter he started aside
at hearing them repeated behind him in a voice half human and half
sepulchral looking around he beheld the shaggy monster seated on end
in a shadow of the cavern where while his restless body swung in
the uneasy manner of the animal it repeated in a sort of low growl
sounds if not words which bore some slight resemblance to the melody
of the singer

the effect of so strange an echo on david may better be imagined than
described his eyes opened as if he doubted their truth and his voice
became instantly mute in excess of wonder a deep-laid scheme of
communicating some important intelligence to heyward was driven from
his recollection by an emotion which very nearly resembled fear but
which he was fain to believe was admiration under its influence he
exclaimed aloud she expects you and is at hand and precipitately
left the cavern




chapter 

 snug have you the lion's part written pray you if it
 be give it to me for i am slow of study

 quince you may do it extempore for it is nothing but
 roaring
 midsummer night's dream

there was a strange blending of the ridiculous with that which was
solemn in this scene the beast still continued its rolling and
apparently untiring movements though its ludicrous attempt to imitate
the melody of david ceased the instant the latter abandoned the field
the words of gamut were as has been seen in his native tongue and
to duncan they seem pregnant with some hidden meaning though nothing
present assisted him in discovering the object of their allusion a
speedy end was however put to every conjecture on the subject by the
manner of the chief who advanced to the bedside of the invalid and
beckoned away the whole group of female attendants that had clustered
there to witness the skill of the stranger he was implicitly though
reluctantly obeyed and when the low echo which rang along the hollow
natural gallery from the distant closing door had ceased pointing
toward his insensible daughter he said

now let my brother show his power

thus unequivocally called on to exercise the functions of his assumed
character heyward was apprehensive that the smallest delay might prove
dangerous endeavoring then to collect his ideas he prepared to
perform that species of incantation and those uncouth rites under
which the indian conjurers are accustomed to conceal their ignorance and
impotency it is more than probable that in the disordered state of his
thoughts he would soon have fallen into some suspicious if not fatal
error had not his incipient attempts been interrupted by a fierce growl
from the quadruped three several times did he renew his efforts to
proceed and as often was he met by the same unaccountable opposition
each interruption seeming more savage and threatening than the
preceding

the cunning ones are jealous said the huron i go brother the
woman is the wife of one of my bravest young men deal justly by her
peace he added beckoning to the discontented beast to be quiet i
go

the chief was as good as his word and duncan now found himself alone
in that wild and desolate abode with the helpless invalid and the fierce
and dangerous brute the latter listened to the movements of the indian
with that air of sagacity that a bear is known to possess until another
echo announced that he had also left the cavern when it turned and
came waddling up to duncan before whom it seated itself in its natural
attitude erect like a man the youth looked anxiously about him for
some weapon with which he might make a resistance against the attack he
now seriously expected

it seemed however as if the humor of the animal had suddenly changed
instead of continuing its discontented growls or manifesting any
further signs of anger the whole of its shaggy body shook violently as
if agitated by some strange internal convulsion the huge and unwieldy
talons pawed stupidly about the grinning muzzle and while heyward kept
his eyes riveted on its movements with jealous watchfulness the grim
head fell on one side and in its place appeared the honest sturdy
countenance of the scout who was indulging from the bottom of his soul
in his own peculiar expression of merriment

hist said the wary woodsman interrupting heyward's exclamation of
surprise the varlets are about the place and any sounds that are not
natural to witchcraft would bring them back upon us in a body

tell me the meaning of this masquerade and why you have attempted so
desperate an adventure

ah reason and calculation are often outdone by accident returned the
scout but as a story should always commence at the beginning i will
tell you the whole in order after we parted i placed the commandant
and the sagamore in an old beaver lodge where they are safer from
the hurons than they would be in the garrison of edward for your
high north-west indians not having as yet got the traders among them
continued to venerate the beaver after which uncas and i pushed for the
other encampment as was agreed have you seen the lad

to my great grief he is captive and condemned to die at the rising of
the sun

i had misgivings that such would be his fate resumed the scout in
a less confident and joyous tone but soon regaining his naturally firm
voice he continued his bad fortune is the true reason of my being
here for it would never do to abandon such a boy to the hurons a rare
time the knaves would have of it could they tie the bounding elk and
the long carabine as they call me to the same stake though why they
have given me such a name i never knew there being as little likeness
between the gifts of killdeer and the performance of one of your real
canada carabynes as there is between the natur of a pipe-stone and a
flint

keep to your tale said the impatient heyward we know not at what
moment the hurons may return

no fear of them a conjurer must have his time like a straggling
priest in the settlements we are as safe from interruption as a
missionary would be at the beginning of a two hours discourse well
uncas and i fell in with a return party of the varlets the lad was much
too forward for a scout nay for that matter being of hot blood he
was not so much to blame and after all one of the hurons proved a
coward and in fleeing led him into an ambushment

and dearly has he paid for the weakness

the scout significantly passed his hand across his own throat and
nodded as if he said i comprehend your meaning after which he
continued in a more audible though scarcely more intelligible language

after the loss of the boy i turned upon the hurons as you may judge
there have been scrimmages atween one or two of their outlyers and
myself but that is neither here nor there so after i had shot the
imps i got in pretty nigh to the lodges without further commotion then
what should luck do in my favor but lead me to the very spot where one
of the most famous conjurers of the tribe was dressing himself as i
well knew for some great battle with satan though why should i call
that luck which it now seems was an especial ordering of providence so
a judgmatical rap over the head stiffened the lying impostor for a time
and leaving him a bit of walnut for his supper to prevent an uproar
and stringing him up atween two saplings i made free with his finery
and took the part of the bear on myself in order that the operations
might proceed

and admirably did you enact the character the animal itself might have
been shamed by the representation

lord major returned the flattered woodsman i should be but a poor
scholar for one who has studied so long in the wilderness did i not
know how to set forth the movements or natur of such a beast had
it been now a catamount or even a full-size panther i would have
embellished a performance for you worth regarding but it is no such
marvelous feat to exhibit the feats of so dull a beast though for that
matter too a bear may be overacted yes yes it is not every imitator
that knows natur may be outdone easier than she is equaled but all our
work is yet before us where is the gentle one

heaven knows i have examined every lodge in the village without
discovering the slightest trace of her presence in the tribe

you heard what the singer said as he left us she is at hand and
expects you

i have been compelled to believe he alluded to this unhappy woman

the simpleton was frightened and blundered through his message but
he had a deeper meaning here are walls enough to separate the whole
settlement a bear ought to climb therefore will i take a look above
them there may be honey-pots hid in these rocks and i am a beast you
know that has a hankering for the sweets

the scout looked behind him laughing at his own conceit while he
clambered up the partition imitating as he went the clumsy motions of
the beast he represented but the instant the summit was gained he made
a gesture for silence and slid down with the utmost precipitation

she is here he whispered and by that door you will find her i
would have spoken a word of comfort to the afflicted soul but the sight
of such a monster might upset her reason though for that matter major
you are none of the most inviting yourself in your paint

duncan who had already swung eagerly forward drew instantly back on
hearing these discouraging words

am i then so very revolting he demanded with an air of chagrin

you might not startle a wolf or turn the royal americans from a
discharge but i have seen the time when you had a better favored look
your streaked countenances are not ill-judged of by the squaws but
young women of white blood give the preference to their own color see
he added pointing to a place where the water trickled from a rock
forming a little crystal spring before it found an issue through the
adjacent crevices you may easily get rid of the sagamore's daub and
when you come back i will try my hand at a new embellishment it's
as common for a conjurer to alter his paint as for a buck in the
settlements to change his finery

the deliberate woodsman had little occasion to hunt for arguments to
enforce his advice he was yet speaking when duncan availed himself
of the water in a moment every frightful or offensive mark was
obliterated and the youth appeared again in the lineaments with which
he had been gifted by nature thus prepared for an interview with
his mistress he took a hasty leave of his companion and disappeared
through the indicated passage the scout witnessed his departure with
complacency nodding his head after him and muttering his good wishes
after which he very coolly set about an examination of the state of the
larder among the hurons the cavern among other purposes being used
as a receptacle for the fruits of their hunts

duncan had no other guide than a distant glimmering light which served
however the office of a polar star to the lover by its aid he was
enabled to enter the haven of his hopes which was merely another
apartment of the cavern that had been solely appropriated to the
safekeeping of so important a prisoner as a daughter of the commandant
of william henry it was profusely strewed with the plunder of that
unlucky fortress in the midst of this confusion he found her he sought
pale anxious and terrified but lovely david had prepared her for such
a visit

duncan she exclaimed in a voice that seemed to tremble at the sounds
created by itself

alice he answered leaping carelessly among trunks boxes arms and
furniture until he stood at her side

i knew that you would never desert me she said looking up with
a momentary glow on her otherwise dejected countenance but you are
alone grateful as it is to be thus remembered i could wish to think
you are not entirely alone

duncan observing that she trembled in a manner which betrayed her
inability to stand gently induced her to be seated while he recounted
those leading incidents which it has been our task to accord alice
listened with breathless interest and though the young man touched
lightly on the sorrows of the stricken father taking care however not
to wound the self-love of his auditor the tears ran as freely down the
cheeks of the daughter as though she had never wept before the soothing
tenderness of duncan however soon quieted the first burst of her
emotions and she then heard him to the close with undivided attention
if not with composure

and now alice he added you will see how much is still expected
of you by the assistance of our experienced and invaluable friend the
scout we may find our way from this savage people but you will have to
exert your utmost fortitude remember that you fly to the arms of your
venerable parent and how much his happiness as well as your own
depends on those exertions

can i do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me

and for me too continued the youth gently pressing the hand he held
in both his own

the look of innocence and surprise which he received in return convinced
duncan of the necessity of being more explicit

this is neither the place nor the occasion to detain you with selfish
wishes he added but what heart loaded like mine would not wish to
cast its burden they say misery is the closest of all ties our common
suffering in your behalf left but little to be explained between your
father and myself

and dearest cora duncan surely cora was not forgotten

not forgotten no regretted as woman was seldom mourned before your
venerable father knew no difference between his children but i alice
you will not be offended when i say that to me her worth was in a
degree obscured 

then you knew not the merit of my sister said alice withdrawing her
hand of you she ever speaks as of one who is her dearest friend

i would gladly believe her such returned duncan hastily i could
wish her to be even more but with you alice i have the permission of
your father to aspire to a still nearer and dearer tie

alice trembled violently and there was an instant during which she bent
her face aside yielding to the emotions common to her sex but they
quickly passed away leaving her mistress of her deportment if not of
her affections

heyward she said looking him full in the face with a touching
expression of innocence and dependency give me the sacred presence and
the holy sanction of that parent before you urge me further

though more i should not less i could not say the youth was about to
answer when he was interrupted by a light tap on his shoulder starting
to his feet he turned and confronting the intruder his looks fell on
the dark form and malignant visage of magua the deep guttural laugh of
the savage sounded at such a moment to duncan like the hellish taunt
of a demon had he pursued the sudden and fierce impulse of the instant
he would have cast himself on the huron and committed their fortunes
to the issue of a deadly struggle but without arms of any description
ignorant of what succor his subtle enemy could command and charged with
the safety of one who was just then dearer than ever to his heart he no
sooner entertained than he abandoned the desperate intention

what is your purpose said alice meekly folding her arms on her
bosom and struggling to conceal an agony of apprehension in behalf of
heyward in the usual cold and distant manner with which she received
the visits of her captor

the exulting indian had resumed his austere countenance though he drew
warily back before the menacing glance of the young man's fiery eye he
regarded both his captives for a moment with a steady look and then
stepping aside he dropped a log of wood across a door different from
that by which duncan had entered the latter now comprehended the manner
of his surprise and believing himself irretrievably lost he drew
alice to his bosom and stood prepared to meet a fate which he hardly
regretted since it was to be suffered in such company but magua
meditated no immediate violence his first measures were very evidently
taken to secure his new captive nor did he even bestow a second glance
at the motionless forms in the center of the cavern until he had
completely cut off every hope of retreat through the private outlet he
had himself used he was watched in all his movements by heyward who
however remained firm still folding the fragile form of alice to his
heart at once too proud and too hopeless to ask favor of an enemy
so often foiled when magua had effected his object he approached his
prisoners and said in english

the pale faces trap the cunning beavers but the red-skins know how to
take the yengeese

huron do your worst exclaimed the excited heyward forgetful that a
double stake was involved in his life you and your vengeance are alike
despised

will the white man speak these words at the stake asked magua
manifesting at the same time how little faith he had in the other's
resolution by the sneer that accompanied his words

here singly to your face or in the presence of your nation

le renard subtil is a great chief returned the indian he will go
and bring his young men to see how bravely a pale face can laugh at
tortures

he turned away while speaking and was about to leave the place through
the avenue by which duncan had approached when a growl caught his ear
and caused him to hesitate the figure of the bear appeared in the door
where it sat rolling from side to side in its customary restlessness
magua like the father of the sick woman eyed it keenly for a moment
as if to ascertain its character he was far above the more vulgar
superstitions of his tribe and so soon as he recognized the well-known
attire of the conjurer he prepared to pass it in cool contempt but
a louder and more threatening growl caused him again to pause then he
seemed as if suddenly resolved to trifle no longer and moved resolutely
forward

the mimic animal which had advanced a little retired slowly in his
front until it arrived again at the pass when rearing on his hinder
legs it beat the air with its paws in the manner practised by its
brutal prototype

fool exclaimed the chief in huron go play with the children and
squaws leave men to their wisdom

he once more endeavored to pass the supposed empiric scorning even the
parade of threatening to use the knife or tomahawk that was pendent
from his belt suddenly the beast extended its arms or rather legs and
inclosed him in a grasp that might have vied with the far-famed power of
the bear's hug itself heyward had watched the whole procedure on the
part of hawkeye with breathless interest at first he relinquished his
hold of alice then he caught up a thong of buckskin which had been
used around some bundle and when he beheld his enemy with his two arms
pinned to his side by the iron muscles of the scout he rushed upon him
and effectually secured them there arms legs and feet were encircled
in twenty folds of the thong in less time than we have taken to record
the circumstance when the formidable huron was completely pinioned the
scout released his hold and duncan laid his enemy on his back utterly
helpless

throughout the whole of this sudden and extraordinary operation magua
though he had struggled violently until assured he was in the hands of
one whose nerves were far better strung than his own had not uttered
the slightest exclamation but when hawkeye by way of making a summary
explanation of his conduct removed the shaggy jaws of the beast and
exposed his own rugged and earnest countenance to the gaze of the huron
the philosophy of the latter was so far mastered as to permit him to
utter the never failing

hugh

ay you've found your tongue said his undisturbed conqueror now
in order that you shall not use it to our ruin i must make free to stop
your mouth

as there was no time to be lost the scout immediately set about
effecting so necessary a precaution and when he had gagged the indian
his enemy might safely have been considered as hors de combat

by what place did the imp enter asked the industrious scout when his
work was ended not a soul has passed my way since you left me

duncan pointed out the door by which magua had come and which now
presented too many obstacles to a quick retreat

bring on the gentle one then continued his friend we must make a
push for the woods by the other outlet

tis impossible said duncan fear has overcome her and she is
helpless alice my sweet my own alice arouse yourself now is the
moment to fly tis in vain she hears but is unable to follow go
noble and worthy friend save yourself and leave me to my fate

every trail has its end and every calamity brings its lesson
returned the scout there wrap her in them indian cloths conceal all
of her little form nay that foot has no fellow in the wilderness it
will betray her all every part now take her in your arms and follow
leave the rest to me

duncan as may be gathered from the words of his companion was eagerly
obeying and as the other finished speaking he took the light person
of alice in his arms and followed in the footsteps of the scout they
found the sick woman as they had left her still alone and passed
swiftly on by the natural gallery to the place of entrance as they
approached the little door of bark a murmur of voices without announced
that the friends and relatives of the invalid were gathered about the
place patiently awaiting a summons to re-enter

if i open my lips to speak hawkeye whispered my english which is
the genuine tongue of a white-skin will tell the varlets that an enemy
is among them you must give em your jargon major and say that we
have shut the evil spirit in the cave and are taking the woman to the
woods in order to find strengthening roots practise all your cunning
for it is a lawful undertaking

the door opened a little as if one without was listening to the
proceedings within and compelled the scout to cease his directions a
fierce growl repelled the eavesdropper and then the scout boldly threw
open the covering of bark and left the place enacting the character of
a bear as he proceeded duncan kept close at his heels and soon found
himself in the center of a cluster of twenty anxious relatives and
friends

the crowd fell back a little and permitted the father and one who
appeared to be the husband of the woman to approach

has my brother driven away the evil spirit demanded the former what
has he in his arms

thy child returned duncan gravely the disease has gone out of her
it is shut up in the rocks i take the woman to a distance where i will
strengthen her against any further attacks she will be in the wigwam of
the young man when the sun comes again

when the father had translated the meaning of the stranger's words into
the huron language a suppressed murmur announced the satisfaction with
which this intelligence was received the chief himself waved his hand
for duncan to proceed saying aloud in a firm voice and with a lofty
manner

go i am a man and i will enter the rock and fight the wicked one

heyward had gladly obeyed and was already past the little group when
these startling words arrested him

is my brother mad he exclaimed is he cruel he will meet the
disease and it will enter him or he will drive out the disease and
it will chase his daughter into the woods no let my children wait
without and if the spirit appears beat him down with clubs he is
cunning and will bury himself in the mountain when he sees how many
are ready to fight him

this singular warning had the desired effect instead of entering
the cavern the father and husband drew their tomahawks and posted
themselves in readiness to deal their vengeance on the imaginary
tormentor of their sick relative while the women and children broke
branches from the bushes or seized fragments of the rock with a
similar intention at this favorable moment the counterfeit conjurers
disappeared

hawkeye at the same time that he had presumed so far on the nature
of the indian superstitions was not ignorant that they were rather
tolerated than relied on by the wisest of the chiefs he well knew the
value of time in the present emergency whatever might be the extent of
the self-delusion of his enemies and however it had tended to assist
his schemes the slightest cause of suspicion acting on the subtle
nature of an indian would be likely to prove fatal taking the path
therefore that was most likely to avoid observation he rather skirted
than entered the village the warriors were still to be seen in the
distance by the fading light of the fires stalking from lodge to
lodge but the children had abandoned their sports for their beds of
skins and the quiet of night was already beginning to prevail over the
turbulence and excitement of so

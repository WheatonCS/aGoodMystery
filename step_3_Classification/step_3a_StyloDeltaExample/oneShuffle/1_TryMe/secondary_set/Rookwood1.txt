it has been observed and i am apt to believe that it is an
observation that will generally be found true that before a
terrible truth comes to light there are certain murmuring

i saw great satan like a sexton stand
with his intolerable spade in hand
charles lamb
within the deep recesses a vault the last
abiding place an ancient family many generations
 whose long line were there congregated
 and at midnight dreariest hour two
figures might be discovered sitting wrapt in
silence as profound as that the multitudinous
dead around them beings this nether world
they seemed yet so moveless was the attitude 
each so breathless the repose maintained and sot

lockwood
shadowy and fantastical the appearance the
figures themselves as imperfectly revealed in the
clairobscur occasioned by the light a single
candle struggling with the gloom that had any
human eye gazed upon them the impression
produced upon the spectators mind would
doubtless have been if perchance with less
 superstition he had not put a construction
equally horrible upon the meeting that the
objects he beheld were embodied spirits the
departed enacting the spot which had burst
the leaden bondage the tomb and were
still hovering nigh the place their imprisonment

so far as it could be discerned the cemetery was
 antique construction and no inconsiderable
extent its walls and roof were solid stone
masonry the latter rising in a wide semicircular
arch to it might be the height some seventeen
feet measured from the centre the ceiling to
the ground floor the sides the sepulchre
 s
were subdivided by thin walls stone into
ranges low narrow but deep compartments
adapted to the reception the dead the entrance
to each recess consisted a doorway
surmounted by small obtuselypointed arches
resting upon slender pillars also stone the
spandrils between each being filled up with
a variety escutcheons shields and other
trophies and inscriptions relating to the occupants
 each particular cell there were no
doors to these recesses and within might be
traced huge heaps coffins reared pile upon
pile the accumulation ages packed with a
prodigality worthy a misers stores one upon
another till the floor groaned with the weight 
lead and in some instances the lower layers
had been crushed and flattened ijy the superincumbent
mass numerous however as were
these receptacles the proportion bodies exceeded
their capabilities and in the further
extremity there was an additional range 
coffins which could not be included in the cells
 lockwood
encroaching upon the limits the vault and
attesting by their increase the dread ravages 
the destroyer
depending from a hook fixed in one the
stone pillars previously described hung a rack
 old timeoutofmind hatchments seemingly
placed there in solemn mockery the sunken
greatness the fall whereof they so eloquently
bespoke stained and tarnished was their once
flaunting emblazonry tattered and threadbare
their once spotless quarterings even their triumphant
 resurgam was obliterated and
effaced as if hope itself had been annihilated
another remarkable feature this phantasmalogical
picture should be noticed in the centre
 the chamber loomed the ghostly outline 
the erect effigies an armed warrior sir
llanulph lockwood the builder the mausoleum
and the founder the family that slept
the sleep death within its walls wrought in
black marble the size life this stern and
sable statue rare workmanship and great
 
antiquity differed from most monumental sculpture
in that the posture chosen for the warlike
figure was erect and lifelike not recumbent and
supine the warrior was represented as sheathed
in a complete suit plate armour decorated with
the armorial surcoat and grasping the pummel
 a weighty curtal axe his usual weapon 
defence a conicallyformed helmet rested upon
his gloomy brow revealing his harsh but commanding
features the golden spur knighthood
was on his heel and beneath enshrined in a costly
marble sarcophagus rested the mortal remains 
what had once been one the sternest knights
to his mortal foe that ever put spare in the rest
the effect the light or light and shade
within the vault must not pass unobserved
darkness with light so daringly doth tight
that each confounding other both appear
as darkness light and light but darkness were
stuck in a rusty sconce against one the
columns overhead the flickering candle in
 drayton
 eookwooi
effectually contending with the dank heavy
atmosphere that pervaded this house death
not only lent additional duskiness to the depths
its rays were unable to penetrate but increased
the apparent size the tomb producing the
strangest combinations and multiplying the
images horror a hundred fold by giving
ample range and scope for the most hideous
speculations
streaming in a wavering transverse line upon
the ribbed roof the yellow flare partially fell
upon the human figures before alluded to throwing
them into bold black relief and casting
their opaque fantastical shadows along the
slabbed floor dilated in the darkling twilight
to gigantic proportions the marble form 
the knight received a gleam the same
lustre which striking more particularly upon
the grim features communicated to the rigid
aspect a wild and terrible expression coupled
with the other group and in connection
with the awful scene the figure might be likened

to a knight romance in the act bursting
some spell hellengendered sorcery or it
might be compared to one those mystic
warrior creations that are said to watch perpetually
the neverfailing lamps that burn at the
tombs the true disciples the rosy cross
ready to quench their flame for ever should
unhallowed footsteps approach
covered with a mouldering pall and laid
upon a bier an old oaken coffin served the
two parties for a seat between them stood a
bottle and a glass the latter although emptied
 its contents giving token from the perfume
that hung round it still the most pellucid
but not least potent spirituous instalments
and showing that whatever might be the object
 this stealthy communion the comfort the
creature had not been altogether overlooked at
the feet one the personages were laid a
mattock a spade a horn lantern a bunch 
keys and some other matters symbolical his
vocation together with a little bristly blackguards

tan terrier curled up like a hedgehog beside
him he was apparently a very old man
with a bald head hoar as the summit mont
blanc and partially protected from the cold
by that description woollen canon vulgarly
denominated a welch wig his elbow rested
upon his knees his wrist supported his chin
and his grey glassy eyes glimmering like marsh
meteors in the candlelight were fixed upon his
companion with a glance keen searching scrutiny
worthy a cynic philosopher
the object his investigation a much more
youthful and interesting person seemed lost in
the depths reverie and alike insensible to time
place and the object the meeting avith both
hands grasped round the barrel a fowling
piece and with his face leaning upon the same
support the features were entirely concealed
from view the light too being to the back
and shedding its rays over rather than upon his
person aided his disguise yet even thus
imperfectly defined the outline the head and

proportions the figure were eminently striking
and symmetrical
attired in a rough savage costume a sort
 darkgreen chasseur or sporting dress 
the fashion george the seconds day the
period our tale perpetrated in such wise as
might be expected from the hands some untutored
rustic professor the shears attired
then in a foresters dress the roughest texture
and rudest make his wild garb would have
determined his rank as but lowly in the scale 
society had not a certain loftiness manner and
bold though reckless deportment argued pretensions
on the part the wearer to a more elevated
station in life and contradicted in a great measure
the impression produced by the homely
appearance his habiliments
a cap shaggy brown fur fancifully but not
ungracefully formed covered his head from
beneath which dropping in natural clusters over
his neck and shoulders a cloud blackest hair
escaped subsequently when his face was mcwe

fully revealed it proved to be that a young
man dark aspect and grave melancholy
expression countenance approaching even to
the stern when at rest but sufficiently animated
and earnest when engaged in conversation or
otherwise excited then was it lighted by a
pair flashing eyes that showered fire like
electric sparkles from a fullcharged cloud his
features were regular delicately formed and
might be characterized as singularly beautiful
were it not for a want roundness in the contour
 the face occasioned possibly by care anxiety
overexertion want repose c any or all
combined which gave the lineaments a thin
worn look totally distinct however from haggardness
or emaciation some such countenance
as an active abstemious hindoo might be supposed
to possess wherein there was no superfluous
flesh the nose was delicate and fine the
nostril especially so keen and sensitive as that 
an arabian with a pedigree a thousand years 
the upper lip short curing graceful and

haughtily expressive as to complexion his skin
had a truly spanish warmth and intensity 
colouring the tint might have originated in
stain juicy herb or root or from exposure to
the sun and skiey influences with certain
native aids to boot but the result was an
embroiled swarthiness hue that would have
done credit to the tiniest gitano andalusia
even with the true morisco blood purpling in his
veins his form when raised was tall and masculine
and though slight exhibited great personal
vigour and muscular resources and but for the
recklessness manner and unrestrained carriage
and deportment before noticed his appearance
might be designated as prepossessing and attractive
in the extreme
we have before remarked that at the precise
moment whence our narrative commences both
parties were starless hushed and still not a
word was spoken by either scarce a breath
drawn it was a silence befitting the place in
the mean time we shall take advantage the
pause as it must evidently have been to hazard

a slight preliminary account the old man with
the great grey glassy eyes
peter bradley rosewood in the county
 york where he had exercised the vocation 
sexton for the best part a life already drawn
out to the full span ordinarily allotted to mortality
was one those odd grotesque bizarre
caricatures humanity which it occasionally
delighteth our inimitable george cruikshank to
limn so attenuated in the region the legs
and arms as scarcely to remove him from
absolute identity with the skeleton society he
so much affected peters unnatural length and
lankiness limb combined and contrasted with
his round dropsicallooking paunch puffed out
to a very pincushion plumpness made him
no inapt representative a huge bloated
and overgrown spider totally destitute 
hair his bald head reminded one a bleached
scull allowing for the wrinkled furrows in the
forehead and thick beetle brows that projected
like the eaves a barn his hands were i in
long and skinny as the ancient mariners his

fingers spread out like claws after all his eyes
were his most remarkable feature like the
toad ugly and venemous he bore a precious
jewel in his head and like that noxious
reptile his eyes were large lambent and
luminous though cold as the fire an ignis
fatuus and grey as the slaty hue earliest
daybreak and then his laugh that hollow
chuckling laugh distinguishable from all other
laughter by an occasional wheezing choke which
threatened during its paroxysm to terminate the
existence and merriment the cachinnator
one and the same time this laugh had besides
something so horrible about it that though
seldom heard it never failed when indulged
in to excite a shuddering response in the
auditor whoever the luckless wight might be
it was a something between the gibbering 
a ghoul and the grin an hyaena
the inward man corresponded with his outward
appearance his soul was in his spade
he was essentially a man graves the

earth earthy the dead deathly habitual
contact with the mould and with the mouldering
had so to speak mildewed and wormeaten his
better sensibilities crusting his mind as with
a scurf and turning the wholesome current
 his blood to black and melancholic bile
something akin to nothingness he seemed and
yet endowed with animation a connecting link
betwixt the breathing body and the bony coiipse
materiality and immateriality in one
the nightmare life in death was he
who thicks mens hood with cold
the churchyard might be called his domain 
the tomb his dwellingplace the charnelhouse
his museum rarities and he displayed as intimate
an acquaintance with the relics the
latter as his brother the spade did with the
scull that mad rogue yorick the kings
jester and exhibited as much assurance in
affixing a name or a date to a hapless mazzard
or fragmentary bone as any satan 

them all could do in illustrating the fossil tusk 
a mammoth the giant jaw the mastodon or
other incomprehensible remnant the extinct
creation the antediluvian world
some other peculiarities had peter bradley
which we shall leave to be developed in the
course our story contenting ourselves with
the mention one faculty which he was
supposed to enjoy the possession which made
him an object no little apprehension to the
habitants rosewood and the neighbourhood
 this was the power predicting the
approach death how he acquired this
faculty was matter abundant conjecture and
had never been satisfactorily explained or rather
the explanations offered had left people more in
the dark than before some said that long practice
enabled him to detect a norihund subject at
a glance that like the vulture he could scent his
prey from afar and that his predictions were
doom others that being familiar with hobgoblins
spectres and all sorts devilry he

gained his knowledge from such unholy association
 and consequently was little better
than a wizard or sorcerer and ought to be
treated as such and burnt at the stake or at
least ducked in a blanket that his lone and
long midnight vigils in the church porch
could be for no good or christianlike purpose
 nay they even went on to say that he
had entered into a compact with the king 
terrors to furnish food for his insatiate maw
on condition his own personal exemption
others more sceptical thought there was nothing
marvellous in the case with them peter was
no prophet people were fools to be frightened
and die only because he said they would do so 
they ought to recover if only to prove him in
error be this as it may whenever there was
an occasional instance mortality in the parish
and sometimes it would so fall out predicted
or not peter had the credit the catastrophe
such was and so ranked in mens esteem peter
bradley rosewood sexton in ordinary
 
wearied with the prolonged silence peter was
the first to speak his voice was harsh and
grating as a rusty hinge
another glass said he pouring out a modicum
 the pale fluid
his companion shook his head
it will keep out the cold continued the
sexton pressing the liquid and you who are
not so much accustomed as i am to the damps
 a vault may suffer from them besides
added he sneeringly it will give you courage r
courage echoed the other raising his
head while the flash his eye resented the
fm plied reproach
ay courage retorted the sexton nay
never stare at me so hard man i doubt
neither your courage nor your firmness but as
both may be put to the test tonight i see no
great harm in making certainty sure and therefore
tis that i press the glass upon you well
as you please i dont want to poison you this
is no doctors stuff no damned decoction or

mixture but honest wholesome gin distilled
before you were born or thought tis as
harmless as mothers milk and as mild and soit
should be for it has lain more years in this
vault than you can number to your head grandson
luke and time is a great improver liquor
whatever it may be men here in this vault
my cellar as i call it hath it been hoarded these
twoandthirty years but if you wont drink
i will so here goes ah capital smacking
his lips that flavour puts me in mind k
night i had here long ago
you must know that when old sir reginald
rosewood was gathered to his fathers there
he lies twoandthirty years ago as i said
before and a grand burial it was that sir
piers tomorrow night will be nothing to itnothing
at all well when the coffin had been
lowered down and the lights put out in the
church i crept back again to the vault with three
bottles under my arm for i like society a certain
sort but it must be my own choosing

and i always think spirit has a keener relish in
such an atmosphere as this so i sat down and
swallowed glass after glass bumper after bumper
and all to sir reginalds repose ha ha i
shall never forget how drunk i got and as the
liquor mounted to my brain how i laughed and
sung and shouted till the roof rang again rare
revelling it was ha ha and no lack fellowship
either no lack boon companions for as
my head reeled and my eyes danced it seemed as
if the dead men and women in their shrouds
and sereclothes came thronging about me
jesting and jabbering laughing as i laughed
singing in screaming chorus and dancing and
whirling round me till it made me giddy to look
at them such white grinning faces had they 
so horribly distorted by their laughter at last
they all broke into a wild hullabaloo there was
a stir amongst the grisly company and up rose
grey old sir reginald whom i had just buried
he seemed strange at first and distant with his

phantom friends but soon became more reconciled
 and then his three ghostly wives for he
had three in his lifetime darted towards him
and wound their bony arms around his neck in a
way that must have certainly strangled him had
any life been left and they kissed his livid lips
pah well at last he perceived me and
nodded so i pledged him a brimmer and then
all at once fell back as if struck with a shot
right through the heart ha ha that was a
night out the three bottles i then brought
with me this is the last i stowed it away in
one the niches and there it has remained ever
since this is a famous cellar for keeping liquors
in but for fear accidents as ive not been
here for some time latterly and may not often
come again ill not throw away the bottle while
the screws at hand and as the first was drained
to his fathers memory why be this quaffed to
the son heres to the rest eternal sir piers
rook wood youll say amen to that pledge

luke or youve no grandchild mine and
having once again emptied the beaker he replenished
it and handed it to his grandson
to his eternal damnation fiercely exclaimed
luke and seizing the glass he dashed
it to fragments upon the coffin lid
the crash the broken glass was instantly
succeeded by a noise like that rattling bones
proceeding from the coffin whereupon the
speakers sat it seemed as the dead within
whose repose had been thus wantonly violated
were about to arise and avenge the insult offered
to his sanctuary luke recoiled in horror at the
sound a clammy moisture burst from out his
pores
what means this he faltered
tis but a rat returned the sexton grinning
contemptuously thou art safe it will not
harm thee thou hast not learned the art 
raising a spirit yet though it seems thou can st
lay other peoples spirits and thine own without
tutorship and chuckling at his own conceit he

applied his knuckles to the lid a smart rap
proved the truth his assertion a monstrous
graverat sprang from a hole underneath the
coffin and was immediately killed by the dog
well done mole cried the sexton i tell
thee what luke added he turning to his
grandson who was sullenly gazing at the dog
the next time thou art in the mood for blaspheming
i trust thou wilt not exercise thyself
at the expense my glasses and good liquor
thy fright may teach thee better conduct in
future marry but thou art a pious son and
speaks with becoming reverence thy dead
father
why should i reverence his memory
answered luke bitterly who showed no fatherly
love for me he disowned me in life in
death i disown him sir piers rook wood was
no father mine
he had at least the reputation being so 
but thou art doubtless better informed returned
the sexton than i can possibly be on a

subject that so nearly concerns thyself whose
son art thou then
whose do i hear thee ask the questioned
certainly you do and repeat it avhose
son art thou p
thy daughters susan bradley
that i know but thy father for i presume
thou hadst a father asked the sexton
with a diabolical grin
accursed fiend muttered luke since it
must be and thou hast said it he was my
reputed father father ha the name sounds
strange in my ears and with sir piers twas
but the name and not the heart
he was as surely thy father as susanbradley
thy mother was my daughter rejoined
the sexton
and surely cried luke impetuously
thou needs not boast the connection tis
not for thee old man to couple their names
together to exult in thy daughters disgrace and
thine own dishonour shame shame speak

not them in the same breath if thou wouldst
not have me invoke curses on the dead i would
be at peace with him now
reverential prayers and tears were fitter
methinks than curses from thy lips persisted
the sexton anxious to rankle the wound which
he perceived he had inflicted a theme like
the present
prayers and tears vociferated luke
my prayers would turn to curses my tears to
blood i have no reverence whatever thou
mayst have for the seducer for the murderer
 my mother
murderer repeated the sexton apparently
startled and affecting astonishment thou
hast choice store epithets sir piers a murderer

tush answered luke indignantly pretend
not to be ignorant thou hast better
knowledge the truth or falsehood the dark
tale that has gone abroad respecting my mothers
fate than i have and unless report has belied you

foully have had substantial reasons for keeping
sealed lips on the subject this you know best
yourself you will answer for it hereafter if you
have bartered eternal justice for unrighteous
gold but whether she died a broken heartbroken
by his perfidy whether she fell a victim
to remorse to despair her crushed spirit
sinking under the pressure penitential sorrow
for her crime a crime which he was the author
and origin whether more subtle and efficient
means were taken to remove her may rest in
doubt vague and uncertain as are hopes hereafter
yet thus much is assured namely that
he sir piers rook wood was the primary cause
 her death and in effect if not in intent her
destroyer
sorrow never broke susans heart said the
sexton with a ghastly grin die as she might
she died impenitent
her sin then rest with him her blood cries
out for vengeance

vengeance belonged to the lord quoth
the sexton leave sir piers to settle his
account elsewhere i warrant me he will not
want thy assistance to help him towards the brink
 the pit that is bottomless and now seeing
that he has thrown off this mortal coil and hath
never a word to say in his defence or power to act
in offence though i grant that during life he
showed thee no great sympathy no marked
paternal attention such as a youth in thy situation
was entitled to claim for he knew thou
wert his son yet considering that he is gone
bury thy hatred with him let not thy anger
reach beyond the grave say thou forgives him
for myself i could forgive him nay
more i do may god forgive his injuries tome
but for her
 and why except her why not extend thy
rdq fca her both are dead and gone and the
tvoauos

as a dead body clothed in all the hideous apparel
 the tomb rolled forth to his feet
it is thy mothers corpse answered the
sexton i brought thee hither to behold it 
but thou hast anticipated my intentions
this my mother shrieked luke can
the dead indeed hear he shudder ingle added
this is a solemn token she was not insensible
to my adjuration
he dropped upon his knees by the body
seizing one its chilly hands and bending over
the countenance the dead as it lay upon the
floor with its face upwards
the sexton took the candle from the sconce
art thou sure tis she demanded luke ashe
approached with the light
as sure as that thou livest was the reply
can this be death shouted luke half
frantic impossible oh god she stirs 
she moves the light quick i see her stir 
this is dreadful intolerable
 do not deceive yourself said the sexton in

a tone which betrayed more emotion than was his
wont tis the bewilderment fancy she
will never stir again poor wench and he
shaded the candle with his hand so as to
throw the light full upon the deadly visage it
was motionless as that an image carved in
stone pale was that face as monumental marble 
beneath the reflex the yellow flame it wore a
warlike tint sicklied to a banish white no
trace corruption was visible upon the rigid yet
exquisite tracery its features no livid hue
deformed the delicacy and beauty its lineaments
but lovely as it had been in life unrivalled
for its fairness so was it in death
the sight was indeed a marvel and a mystery it
was as if some pitying spirit had seized the
moment
before decays effacing fingers
had swept the lines where beauty lingers
to arrest the hands the spoiler ere one withering
touch had been laid upon her brow ere a breath
 his blighting atmosphere had fallen upon

his victim and failing to avert the stroke fatcj
had invested the fine clay it could not reanimate
with a perpetuity living loveliness a profuse
cloud raven hair escaped from its
statements in the fall which hung like a
dark veil over the bosom and person the departed
and presented a startling contrast to the
prevailing paleness the skin and the white
sereclothes flesh still adhered to the hand
though it smouldered into dust within the gripe
 luke as he pressed the fingers to his lips
the garments the dead were disposed like
nightgear about her person and from without
their folds a few withered flowers had fallen a
strong aromatic odour a pungent nature was
diffused around hence it was evident that the
art by which the ancient egyptians endeavoured
to rescue their kindred from decomposition had
been resorted to to preserve the fleeting charms
 the unfortunate susan bradley making it
evident also that he who living loved lier not
or loving had destroyed hers yet when dead 
lost to him for ever had sought actuated
by some inscrutable revulsion feeling to save
from utter extinction those fatal endowments 
person which had first found favour in his
eyes and ultimately ensured the destruction 
the hapless possessor
a pause awful silence succeeded broken
only by the panting respiration luke he
spoke not groaned not moved not but his
breast laboured heavily with suppressed emotion
and there was a quivering in the muscles 
his limbs like that proceeding from severe
paralytic affection the sexton stood by apparently
an indifferent spectator the scene
 horror he rendered no assistance pronounced
no word sympathy expressed no
commiseration but remained fixed for a few
moments in the attitude we have described his
eye wandered from the dead to the living and
gleamed with a peculiar and indefinable expression
half apathy half abstraction for one
single instant as he scrutinized the features 

his daughter his brow contracted as in anger
immediately afterwards was elevated as in scorn 
but otherwise you would have sought in vain to
read the purport that cold insensible glance
which dwelt for one brief space on the face the
mother and settled eventually upon her son
worlds would that son have given to have been
at that instant equally insensible a prey to the
keenest anguish to agony almost insupportable
he yet obtained no relief in tears no
drop moisture found its way to his eyes the
agony his emotions can only be conceived by
those who have endured and which us hath
altogether escaped the martyrdom moments
like to those who like him have felt the iron
enter into their soul and have drained to the
dregs the bowl bitterness
brother hath it been thine to look thy last
upon the lifeless form one who has been to
thee thy tenderest friend thy gentlest adviser 
thy fondest truest counsellor the only partner
 thy boyish hopes the sole sharer 

thy boyish fiefs the confidant thy maturer
years the one alone to whom all thy hidden
thoughts were poured forth in whom thy love
unalloyed by passion unmixed with jealousy
was centred hast thou seen the light tenderness
that beamed in those dear eyes dimmed
extinguished hast thou known the moment
when the silver music that dwelt upon that
tongue hath become mute 
father hast thou gazed thy last upon thy
child thy young thy beautiful child thy daily
prayer thy nightly dream thy cherished hope
thy fairest flower thy one sole star the
breath thy nostrils the apple thine eye 
and thou husband divorced by death thy
bride hath been torn from thy arms in the
full fruition thy happiness the cup 
content was too full it hath been dashed
to the ground broken in pieces she is
gone she is fled the arm that clung to thee
is nerveless the lips that showered their warm
caresses upon thine can caress thee never again 

the bosom that cherished thee heaves no longer 
the heart that worshipped thee beats no more
son the last link that bound thee to thy fellows
is snapped in twain all others have discarded
thee have cast thee from them save her who now
lies in death before thee thy mother through
good and ill report hath been always faithful to
thy fortunes ever soothing never reproaching
thee calming thy wrath mitigating thy
miseries now thou art utterly desolate thou
hast lost every thing even her
all ye who have similarly suffered need
no description the extent lukes suffering
 the heartquake that shook him
 an earnest vivacity temperament amounting
even to the fierce he at the same time was
endued nth the tenderest sensibilities his case
was not ike one those we have enumerated
he had known no mothers love no mothers
watchful care no mothers gushing tenderness 
for him lead beamed no mothers wellremembered
smile but the absence this reality had created

in his ardent enthusiastic mind possessed from
infancy with but one fanciful image that his
mother an image a phantasm such as haunts
a dreamers brain something like the object 
his love such as he dreamed she would have
been had she ever blessed him with her presence 
peopling his imagination with a thousand visionary
notions smiles and tears and looks
remembered like the indistinct perceptions 
childhood and dwelt upon as fondly till what
had been but a dream nay the memory a
dream assumed as kfe advanced a substance and
a shape distinct and positive so that when for
the first time he actually beheld the object his
idolatry before him in death no wonder that all
these hoarded emotions years should burst
forth with irresistible vehemence and the long
sealed fountains the heart be unloosed
the sexton as has been before observed made
no effort to console him for some space he
neither spoke nor altered his position at length
 
the withered flowers attracted his attention he
stooped to pick up one them
faded as the hand that gathered ye as the
bosom on which ye were strewn v he murmured
no sweet smell left but faugh holding
in disgust the dry leaves to the flame the
candle they were instantly ignited and the
momentary brilliance played like a smile upon
the features the dead the sexton observed
the effect such was thy lifes he exclaimed 
a brief bright sparkle followed by dark
utter extinction and he flung the expiring
ashes the floweret from his hand
chapter iii
duck you are very cold
i fear you are not well after your travel
hah lights oh horrible i
fer let her have lights enough
such what witchcraft doth he practise that he hath left
a dead hand here
duchess malt
the sextons waning candle now warned him
 the progress time and having completed
his arrangements he addressed himself to luke
intimating his intention departing having
received no answer and remarking no signs 
life about his grandson he began to be apprehensive
that he had fallen into a swoon drawing
near to luke he took him gently by the arm
thus disturbed luke groaned aloud
 
i am glad to find thou canst breathe if
it be only after that melancholy fashion said
the sexton but come i have wasted time
enough already you must indulge your grief
elsewhere
leave me cried luke
leave you what here it were as much
as my office is worth you can retuni some
other night but go you must now at least if
you take on so i never calculated upon a scene
like this or it had been long ere i brought you
hither so come away but first lend me a hand
to replace the body in the coffin
touch it not exclaimed luke she shall
not rest another hour within these accursed
walls i will bear her hence myself
thou wilt do no such thing cried the sexton
i have the keys and the custody this place 
and i will suffer no man but the vicar himself to
interfere with my prerogatives and rights thou
art a fool to think such a thing is it not to
her honour and her credit that she is decently

interred here and what couldst thou do with
the body sell it to the doctor mister titus
tyrconnel and get me the credit aiding and
abetting a bodysnatcher no grandson luke
bethink thee twice ere you deprive your mothers
remains christian burial
it was well for the sexton that the whole 
this speech did not reach lukes ears or he
might have been tempted to put an unpleasant
termination to his taunts as it was he replied
not and after another interval silence
peter asked avhat wouldst thou do with it 
i know not answered luke i cannot
think but here she shall not stay he sobbed
hysterically and relapsed into his former insensibility

at least place the body decently within the
coffin if thou art bent upon committing a rash
act i will not baulk thy humour it is not my
way to interfere so if thou comest to harm tis
 thine own doing i wash my hands it
but why do i clatter thus he heeds me not
rook wood
pol this is worse than midsummer madness
continued the sexton but the lad is
crazed with grief and all about a mother who
has been fourandtwenty years in her grave i
will even put her out the way myself
saying which he proceeded as noiselessly as
possible to raise the corpse in his arms depositing
it softly within its former tenement carefully
as he executed his task he could not accomplish
it without occasioning a slight accident to the
fragile frame insensible as he was luke had
not relinquished the hold he maintained his
mothers hand and when peter lifted the
body the ligaments connecting the hand with
the arm were suddenly snapped asunder it
would appear afterwards that this joint bad been
tampered with and partially dislocated but
without entering into further particulars in this
place it may be sufficient to observe that the
hand detached from the socket at the wrist remained
within the gripe luke ignorant the 
mischief he had occasioned the sexton continued

his labours unconsciously until the noise which
he necessity made in stamping with his heel
upon the plank was the means recalling luke
to sensibility the first thing he perceived
upon collecting his faculties were the skeleton
fingers which he found twined within his own
his frame thrilled as he regarded the severed
limb
 what have you done with her why have
you left this with me said he
it was not my intention to have done so
answered the sexton suspending his occupation
 i have just made fast the lid but it is easily
undone you had better restore it
restore it echoed luke staring at the
bony fragment
ay what advantage is a dead hand 
tis an unlucky keepsake and will lead to
harm the only use i ever heard for such a
thing was in the case bowlegged ben he
who was hanged in irons for murder on hardchase
heath and whose hand was cut off at the

wrist the first night to make therewith a hand
 glory or dead mans candle old mistress
ashton had her throat cut that night and
the candle held by the glorious fingers lighted
her murderers the while and subdued the
poor woman and her servants into an awakening
sleep not even a cry was heard ho 
ho but you have no such intentions im
sure if you had this would never serve
your turn for it must be the limb a hanged
malefactor and the candle must be the melted
fat therefore 
 look there exclaimed luke extending the
hand towards the sexton what seest thou 
what i have seldom seen two hands in one
a dead and a living a sons and a mothers
seest thou nothing upon that finger 
i see something shine hold it nigher the
light ha that is strange truly how came it
there
how came it there ask sir piers 
ask her hushed shouted luke with a wild

burst exulting laughter ha ha ha tis
a wedding ring and look the finger is bent it
must have been placed thereon in life there is
no deception in this no trickery hah 
it would seem not that sinew must have
been contracted in life the tendons are pulled
down so tightly that the ring could not be
withdrawn without breaking the fingers
thou art right it is so this is her hand 
it must be so she was his wedded wife ha 
ha ha
it would seem so
seem i it is undoubted thou art sure that
coffin contains her body 
thy mothers sure as this carcase is my
own
the hand tis hers can any doubt exist 
wherefore should it that hand was broken
from the arm by accident within this moment i
noticed not the occurrence but it must have
been so
 
yes yes course and she was wedded
and i am not 
illegitimate for thy own sake i am glad
 it
 glad my heart will burst oh could i
but establish the fact this marriage her
fame my wrongs would be indeed avenged
be not too sanguine thou wilt find it no
easy task to establish granting it were the
fact and i am inclined to think it might be so
consider whom thou hast to contend with
lady rosewood why she was lady 
before her she shall know it she shall
know it 
ay and her son young sir ranulph think
you he will tamely yield his birthright to you 
isis birthright i mine if this be so sir
ranulph that title belongs to me ill strip
them their borrowed honours ill ha 
ha i shall go mad for joy
a word
i cannot talk cannot listen now
you are beside yourself this can never be
never give me but a hope but an inch
 ground to stand upon a thread to cling to
and thou shalt see how i will maintain my hold
i give thee no hopes i can give thee none
even hadst thou the right how canst thou unfriended
poor make head against those already
in possession and wealthy to boot 
i will brave every difficulty every danger
to assert my claims
grant you will do so you must have
evidence beyond this ring whereon to found those
claims it may satisfy you and other credulous
people as myself for instance that such a
marriage hath taken place but it is scarce likely
to meet with implicit belief with others nor what
is more to obtain for thee the broad lands and
the proud name rosewood and after all
tis the union you mist establish beyond a
doubt between sir piers and your mother for
it is possible at least there may be those will say

so that she was a married woman and yet no
wife to sir piers
they will not repeat the assertion in my
hearing why say this to me 
i do not say so nor do i think so all i
fear is that sir piers precautions were so well
taken that you may never be able to adduce
proof positive that such a marriage did exist
but we may disprove any other alleged
alliance and if sir piers did act with so much
caution why left he this speaking evidence
behind to point like an index to the secret 
it is not easy to account for it and yet the
chances were against the occurrence an event
like the present looking more narrowly at the
wristjoint it would appear as if he had really
intended to prevent such a discovery but had
desisted when his work was partially completed
for sir piers was ever apt to act one moment
and repent it the next and his allowing that
ring to remain most likely proceeded from some
passing feeling remorse besides as i said

before he probably did not calculate upon such a
contingency as this he took care nobody should
see this vault without his permission during his
lifetime i have not had the keys myself before
yesterday these fourandtwenty years although
he has often visited the place during that
period
indeed
ay i have seen him watched him when
he thought no human eye beheld him hither
would he often steal at night and fasten himself
within
 with what intent 
you shall hear hush was not that a
footstep 
i hear nothing proceed
the sexton gave a preparatory cough
one night happening to be within the
church porch as he entered i followed him
unobserved he descended to the vault leaving
the door ajar i crept softly down the steps

and there i saw him standing even where now
thou stances beside an open coffin
that ay that he then unscrewed the lid
he was gazing on the dead within his back
was towards me i could not see his face
but i heard his groans his convulsive sobs his
heartrending cries if i ever pitied human
being i could have pitied sir piers
and yet thou doubtless his having a weight
 secret sin upon his soul thou thickest his
hands were not embrued in blood 
said i so i never doubted it you asked
me if i had seen the deed done i saw her upon
her deathbed there were no indications a
violent upon her person further than
exist upon it now as thou hast seen her
no bruise no blow no wound and yet i
doubt not that she came to that untimely
doubt i she was his wife no i doubt it
not and yet i saw no ceremony take place 

heard no priests blessing pronounced upon them
saw no ring placed upon her finger nor
dreamed such a thing until now howbeit
there is one living can make doubts certainties
but to return to sir piers there he stood
making lamentation moaning and beating his
breast like one distracted tearing his hair and
invoking destruction upon himself until at
length the violence the fit worked its own cure
and he became calmer he then bent himself
over her body and kissed its cold lips as reverently
and tenderly as if she had been his bride
asleep beside him
and this you witnessed 
i did his next proceeding was to pray by
her side long and fervently and seeing him arise
as if with the intention departing i was about
to retreat from my hidingplace when my attention
was arrested by his voice at first i thought
he had perceived me and glad was i when
i found myself mistaken for i make no doubt
had he discovered me spying upon his privacy
but that he would in his wrath have dispatched
me outright he was talking to himself i
ventured once more to look round his face was
then towards the door and as i looked through
the chink at the opening i could see the fierce
glances lies eyes thine bum with a like fire at
this moment that alone would prove thou art thy
fathers son and a true rosewood well his
glances flew like flashes lightning round the
vault and he stood with one foot upon that old
marble monument and his arms spread out as if
about to strike the senseless statue and i could
hear that he was cursing the warrior within the
tomb his words still ring in my ears and i
could almost fancy i heard the frenzied fearful
tone in which he pronounced them thou shalt
hear it for each word dwells upon my memory
first an accursed race he cried thou parent
source from whence that stream hot and
tainted blood which hath raged like lava within
the veins thy sons for generation after generation
succeeding thee had its rise what

hindered me from pouring out upon thy tomb a
rich libation that blood as an offering to
thy manes and to the infernal gods to whom
thou hast sold thyself and haply all thy race 
nothing should hinder me did i deem that
it would act as an expiation my offences as an
atonement my guilt but would it cleanse
and purify my soul would it not deepen my
guilt darken my doom would it not plunge
me beyond redemption to instant perdition i
feel that such an act would do so yet would i
ask thee wherefore is it that this heritage 
crime hath descended from son to son through all
thy line each struggling against inevitable fate
each filled with remorse none escaping 
wherefore is it that through thine agency weare
doomed to have our names blotted for ever
from the fair page heaven to be inscribed
upon the blackest scroll hell better had it
been for them for me that thou hadst never
lived or that thy race had expired with thee
but as this cannot be take back the tenfold
curse wherewith thou hast visited us may it
recoil with all its accumulated horrors and
agonies upon thy own devoted head and he
trampled and spat upon the tombs
i forgive him said luke heaven have
mercy upon his soul
amen responded the sexton his deadliest
foe would not have refused him mercy at
that hour i heard no more apprehensive 
discovery i hastened to conceal myself and well
was it that i did so for scarce a moment had
elapsed ere i heard sir piers departing footsteps
pacing along the aisle
tis a dreadful tale said luke but tell
me i beseech you how came she buried here p
it was sir piers wish she was secretly
brought hither i could tell thee such a tale
about that but another time the candle is
dying in its socket we shall be in darkness
avhat matters it art thou afraid or canst
thou not find thy way from hence without a
light
 
 afraid ha ha what is there that i
fear these gentry not i in light or darkness
and as to the door i have little apprehension
 missing that besides it is now bright
moonlight within the church and therefore if
thou wilt thou shalt have the story and here ton
now we are indeed in complete darkness that
flash was the last let us seat ourselves place
thyself near me that i may know that thou
listeners
fear not that replied luke
chapter iv
fer let me see her face again 
wliy didst not thou pity her what an excellent
honest man mightst thou have been
if thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary
or bold in a good cause opposed thyself
between her innocence and my revenge
i hate thee for it
yebster
groping his way to his former seat and coming
fortunately in contact with the bottle the sexton
applied his lips to its mouth luke followed
having first carefully placed the skeleton hand
within the folds his waistcoat
art thou seated inquired the sexton
i am here beside thee was the reply 
 you have seen your mother began the
sexton and i need not waste words in describing
her if she is beautiful as you beheld
her in death you may conclude she did not lack
attractions when alive in truth she was at
that time reckoned the prettiest girl in the
village and would have been the prettiest in any
village i her father say this and the more
freely that beauty has no weight with me but
rather the reverse i never loved her as i
should have done and for that very cause she
was her mothers child and when her mother
died she left me to live dth her aunt i did
not grieve to part with her she was more than
indifferent to me she was insulting i gave
her a parting word advice do you hear
me
i hear thee answered a hollow voice the
tones which startled the sexton as they
sounded differently from those luke
i told susan continued he recovering from
his momentary surprise and satisfied his
companions attention that her beauty would be
her bane that twas a fatal gift and would prove
her undoing it hath proved so since but she
turned a deaf ear to me then we saw little 
each other but i heard her sometimes and
heard also the admiration she excited
amongst the hinds rosewood and the life
she was leading her admirers for susan had a
tricksy coquettish way with her that gained
her many followers however i never heard a
whisper against her fame not a breath till she
went to live at the hall as the squires mistress 
and then nobody spoke her at least not tome
however i was secretly pleased with the
rumour and determined to satisfy myself and
have my fling at her she had been there then
full six months i went to the hall and asked
to speak with her she refused to see me but i
would not be denied i dodged the menial who
brought her message to the room i saw in a
moment how it was with her i saw why she
refused me i saw that my boding words had

come true she was pregnant i had my revenge
i spared not my reproaches she entreated
me to be silent implored my blessing
my answer was a word coupled with a curse i
turned upon my heel and left the room
go on said luke grinding his teeth
i saw her not again in life some months
afterwards she gave thee birth and it might be
within the year that i heard her demise she
had expired they said suddenly it was then
that sir roger sought me out he was in great
trouble he was frantic he told me an unconnected
story about her decease and hurried me
to the hall i saw her upon her deathbed but i
felt no compassion for her she was beautiful as
ever and seemed to smile i sickened at the
sight and felt my hatred revive
monster muttered luke
i killed her not i could not have harmed a
hair her head but i did not regret her my
revenge had been executed by another my
words had come true her bloom had been

blighted yea even at its freshest i shed no
tear for her vented no sigh in sorrow for in
truth i pitied her not
i could strangle him mentally exclaimed
luke though he is my own blood 
where is the bottle cried the sexton
searching for it thou art cold as ice luke 
we had better leave this
my pulse throbs with fever replied luke
thou hast not touched me but go on i will
hear it out now
not touched thee what was it i felt or
imagined i felt but no matter ah whence
breathes that chill upon my face i would we had
a light where is mole and he called to his
dog but mole had slunk away and answered
not to the call
this is strange said the sexton
 proceed cried luke if thou wouldst not
have me deem thee dastard as well as dotard
well continued peter fortifying his
nerves with a diaught to return what

would you have me do said i to sir piers as
we stood together by the bedside for i was
anxious to know for what motive he had brought
me thither i thought it was not surely to
indulge me with a sight my daughter as he
was not ignorant our sentiments towards each
other but it seemed i was mistaken for he replied
i have suffered none to approach her beside
thyself and my housekeeper agnes thou
knowest her nor will i do so indeed said
i surprised but will you have no crown ers quest
upon the body crowners quest cried hein
amazement no she died in her sleep
wherefore should it be so no no i will suffer
no eyes to look upon her but those she loved
she was ever so modest that i will have no rude
gaze profane her countenance now that she cannot
avert it i tell thee what good excellent
peter for he had at length discovered my will
do my bidding in this and thou shalt have gold
glittering gold in heaps ay in heaps if thou
wilt do it i would have her interred privately

interred this night within our family vault 
the coffin will be brought hither thou and i
will carry it to the place burial i only see
two objections to this i answered name
them said sir piers the one is that a hasty
funeral like this may tend to scandal and may
bring you into trouble the other and the lesser
that i have heard that none but those the
house rosewood their wives and daughters
are ever buried within that vault it hath ever
been the rule for thy first objection replied
sir piers if there be scandal it will attach tome
 i will bear its brunt for the second it is
my pleasure to break the rule in favour thy
daughter who hath ever been dear to me as a
wife and who is there shall say me nay i am
resolved if so be you are resolved sir piers
i rejoined i have nothing to further say and
am ready to do your bidding but reflect 
reflect said he i have reflected oh but
to part with her and he burst into a torrent
 tears to lose her for ever never more to see

that beauteous body to nail it down within a
hideous chest to deliver it to the rioting womb
the thought is insupportable oh that i
could save it at least from that such things
have been done answered i for i preserved
my composure and was not like him carried
away by my grief they have answered he 
but it is too late to think it now where
should i find one who could embalm her dear
body and he burst into a fresh torrent tears
i once knew such a one i replied a
gipsy woman who professed that art and is
accounted an adept amongst her tribe i have
indeed spoken with her myself upon the subject
being one connected with my calling
tell me her name eagerly demanded luke
barbara lovel
great god is it possible barbara lovel 
 the same
thou hast perhaps met with her in thy
wanderings with that wild race she must be
b lockwood
old and wrinkled now if she hath not gone the
way all flesh long ago
she is yet alive i saw her but yesterday
replied luke
alive barbara lovel yet alive i did not
think it
and you found her she did your bidding 
she did sir piers implored me to seek her
out i found her without difficulty told her my
object and she readily consented to accompany
me to the hall sir piers was impatient for
my return he bound us by a terrible oath not
to divulge during his lifetime what was about
to take place i hesitated not to take it for to
speak truth and whatever misgivings i might
have as to susan s i had no desire to betray
thee barbara likewise agreed she listened to
his promises she accepted his offers
there was a moaning sound at that moment
heard within the vault and the dog whined in
the corner whither he had crept the sexton in

his own mind attributed the noise to the cold
current air he had before perceived upon his
cheek and which now breathed upon him again
he noticed the interruption only with a slight
involuntary shudder and proceeded 
barbara lovel had brought with her a box
 spices and gums and fragrant herbs besides
some curiouslyfashioned instruments which i
caught a glimpse odd shape and manufacture
she asked for a chafing dish and charcoal she
made her preparations had linen fetched for her
and basons and i know not what she then
insisted upon being left alone sir piers would
fain have remained in the room but she would
not hear it and locked the door silently she
went to work and as we kept watch without
we perceived a rich steam issue from out the
crevices the door sir piers thought some
accident had happened and was about to force
an entrance when he was checked in his intent
by the loud voice barbara angrily commanding
hin to desist upon pain her instant

departure and the leaving her work unfinished
so he made no further attempt and at nightfall
barbara came forth looking as white as a shroud
she took the key from out the door delivered it to
sir piers and asked to have an interview with him
alone their conference was long and barbara
departed i have reason to think not dissatisfied
with sir piers bounty but this i only conjecture
never having met or spoken with her since
that night presently the coffin was brought 
we were admitted to the room the windows were
thrown wide open the steam had evaporated 
susan was as thou hast seen her she was laid
out placed within the shell and before all was
made fast sir piers with a trembling hand cutoff
one long lock from her black hair which he
said he would keep to his dying day and i make
no doubt he kept his word that night a dreary
and a dark one twas we bore our burthen
hither
something like a groan followed the conclusion
 the sextons discourse it was evident

that it proceeded not from luke as an exclamation
burst from him at the same instant luke
stretched out his arm an unsubstantial something
seemed to press against him communicating
a chill like death to his frame
who is between us p he ejaculated
between us cried the sexton leaping from
the coffin lid with an agility that did him
honour is aught between us p
i will fire off my gun the flash will light
us
do so hastily rejoined the sexton but
not in this direction
get behind me cried luke and he pulled
the trigger
a blaze vivid light illumined the darkness
still nothing was visible save the warrior figure
that showed suddenly and then vanished like a
ghost the buckshot rattled against the farther
 the vault
let us hence cried the sexton who had
rushed to the door and thromi it wide open
mole mole the dog sprang after him

 i could have sworn that i felt something
said luke whence issued that groan
 ask not whence replied peter reach
me my mattock and spade and the lantern they
are behind thee and stay it were better to
bring away the bottle
take them and leave me here
here in the vault i could tell you a story
 that statue that 
not now
you will rue it there is danger the archfiend
himself is not 
leave me i say or await if thou wilt my
coming in the church if there is aught that
may be revealed to my ear alone i will not
quail from it though the dead themselves
should arise to proclaim the mystery it maybe
 but go there are thy tools and he shut
the door with a jar that shook the sextons
frame
peter after some muttered murmuring at the
hardihood and madness as he termed it his
headstrong grandson disposed his lengthy limbs to
 
repose upon a cushioned seat without the
communion railing as the pale moonlight
fell upon his gaunt cadaverous and demoniacal
face he looked like some unholy thing suddenly
annihilated by the presiding influence
 that sacred spot mole crouched himself
in a ring at his masters feet peter had not
dozed many minutes when he was aroused
by lukes return the latter was very pale and
the perspiration stood in big drops upon his
brow
hast thou made fast the door was his first
interrogation
here is the key
what hast thou seen he next inquired
remarking the deathly paleness his face
luke made no answer at that moment the
church clock struck two breaking the stillness 
the place with an iron clang luke raised his
eyes a ray moonlight streaming obliquely
through the painted window fell upon the gilt
lettering a black mural entablature the
 
lower part the inscription was in shade but
the emblazonment and j
keginalus ire koofetoootr ihpcs sluratus
were clear and distinct luke trembled he knew
not why as the sexton pointed to it
thou hast heard the handwriting upon
the wall said the scoffer look there his
kingdom hath been taken from him ha
ha 
let us quit this place and get into the fresh
air i am faints said luke striding past his
companion and traversing the churchfloor
with hasty steps peter was not slow to follow
the key was applied and they emerged into the
churchyard the grassy mounds were bathed
in the moonbeams and the two yew trees
throwing their black jagged shadows over the
grave hills looked like evil spirits brooding
over the sanctified repose the righteous
the sexton noticed the deathly paleness 
lukes countenance but it might be the tinge 
the sallow moonlight
 
i will be with thee at thy cottage ere
daybreaks said the latter and turning an angle
 the church he disappeared from view
he is crazed beyond all question said
peter shouldering his spade and whistling to
mole though it must be confessed his brain
must have been a strong one to have withstood
the trial this night mischief i foresee will
come it but i don t trouble my head with
these matters further a dram and a song will
put care to flight draining the bottle to the
last drop he flung it from him and commenced
chaunting in a high key and cracked voice a
wild ditty the words which ran as follow

the sextons song
the carrion crow is a sexton bold
he taketh the dead from out the mould
he velvet the ground like a miser old
stealthily hiding his store gold

the carrion crow hath a coat black
silky and sleek like a priests to his back 
like a lawyer he grubbeth no matter what way 
the fouler the offal the richer his prey
caw caw the carrion crow
dig dig in the ground below
the carrion crow hath a dainty maw
with savory pickings he crammed his craw
kept meat from the gibbet it pleaseth his whim
it never can hang too long for him
caw caw
the carrion crow smelled powder tis said
like a soldier eschewed the taste cold lead
no jester or mime hath more marvellous wit
for wherever he lighted he maketh a hit
caw caw the carrion crow
dig dig in the ground below
the cottage which peter inhabited adjoined
the churchyard so that he had scarcely concluded
his song when he reached the door and as soon
as he had disposed his tools he betook himself
to slumber
chapter v
brian ralph hearest thou any stirring 
ralph i heard one speak here hard by in the hollow
peace master speak low nouns if i do not hear a bow go
off and the buck bray i never heard deer in my life
bri stand or ill shoot
sir arthur whos there 
bri i am the keeper and do charge you stand
you have stolen my deer
merry devil edmonton
lukes first impulse had been to free himself
from the restraint the sextons society imposed
he longed to commune with himself leaping
the small boundarywall that defended the
churchyard from a deep green lane he hurried
along in a direction contrary to that taken by
the sexton making the best his way until he
rook wood
arrived at a gap in the highbanked hazel hedge
which overhung the road heedless the impediments
thrown in his way by the undergrowth
 a rough ring fence he struck through the
opening that presented itself and climbing over
the mossgrown paling trod presently upon the
elastic sward rosewood park
a few minutes rapid walking brought him to
the summit a rising ground crowned with aged
oaks and as he paused beneath their broad
shadows his troubled spirit soothed by the
quietude the scene in part resumed its
serenity
luke yielded to the gentle influence the
time and hour the stillness the spot
sobered the irritation his frame and the
dewy chilliness cooled the fever his brow
leaning for support against the gnarled trunk
 one the trees he gave himself up to
contemplation the events the last hour 
his whole existence passed in rapid review
before his mental vision the thought the
 
wayward vagabond life he had led the wild
adventures his youth all he had beenof
all he had done all he had endured 
crowded his mind and then like the passing 
a cloud flitting across the autumnal moon and
occasionally obscuring the smiling landscape
before him his soul was shadowed by the remembrance
 the awful revelations the last
hour and the fearful knowledge he had acquired
 his mothers fate his fathers guilt shudderingly
he called to mind the horrors he had
witnessed but the occultation was brief
endurance the cloud passed away the moon was
full again in all her ancient lustre the future
the bright glorious future was before him
and he eagerly longed for the coming struggle
the result which his sanguine anticipations
pictured as guerdon with success
 then why should i perplex myself with
fears r he cried why admit a doubt the
hand fate directs me beckons me to the goal
it will be so that i am assured no more
doubt now that i am away from that
horrible place the tightness that restrained my
chest is gone i can breathe again i have
thrown off the sickening torpor that deadened
my faculties how calm how soothing how
tranquil is this lovely scene the face nature
nature whose loveliness has ever found a
mirror in my bosom smiles upon me welcomes
me i hail this welcome as a harbinger 
returning peace
and this lordly park these proud domains
these towering trees yon ancestral mansion all
that my eye can reach shall call me lord and i
shall be rich powerful happy shall i be
happy wherefore not i will not shackle
myself with the bonds and fetters the enslaved
worldling imposed upon himself i will not bow
down to the habits and fashions acknowledged
by fools who sacrifice their own free will to the
whims and caprices what is called society i
despise them i will conform to no mode life
but that which lieth me my freedom 

purpose shall be subject to no such trammels
and restraints such as i have been such i will
continue to be with none to say me nay i
cannot change my nature i will not attempt it
my wild pastimes my dangerous enterprises i
must and will forego and my companions ha 
how would they grace the board the lord 
rosewood should i be lord that house
how would their names sound in my halls
shall i replace them with new faces shall i
cast them off i have no alternative
wealth they say heareth the heart the
possessor lands enlarge not the freedom 
their lord even i a wanderer homeless
houseless friendless feel as much liberty and
license to roam over this fair park as they could
who deem themselves its owners it is not then
the imaginary right to certain portions this
earth that can confer along with the freehold 
the soil a freedom entire and uncontrouled
such as i have ever courted ever obtained and

to lose which were to lose life itself and all that
sweetens life tis not mere possession that can
confer this if the spirit be wanting but with
nw used as i shall use it increase power
acquisition wealth lands and liberties
will but be an extension and enlargement 
independence and as such enjoyment and
happiness
but were it otherwise there is one gratification
in store that will not fail me revenge 
that thought alone would goad me on to
prosecute my purpose nothing fearing nothing
shunning braving every thing as he
who swims against a headlong stream keeps
his eye fixed on one certain point and makes
for that though wave and tide and current
be adverse even so will i the mark is fixed
reach it i win or perish in the effort
yes they who have persecuted me who
hare contemned my mothers memory who have
deemed me insignificant who have scorned me
aookwood 
as incapable retaliation who have hunted me
down shall find that like the hart at bay i
can turn and gore ay gore 
panting with choler like the proud creature
to whom he had likened himself luke threw a
fierce and angry glance around as if in search 
some object whereupon to expend his rising
wrath and if he encountered nothing he found
at least that which had the effect subduing
his excitement exquisite as the work enchantment
lay the beautiful scene before him
and his heart melted beneath the witchery its
spell as he drank its loveliness into his soul
the eminence whereon he stood was one the
highest points the park and commanded a
view the hall which might be a quarter 
a mile distant discernible through a broken
vista trees its whitened walls shimmering in
the moonlight and its tall chimneys spiring far
from out the round masses wood wherein it lay
embosomed the ground gradually sloped in that
direction occasionally rising into swells studded
with magnificent timber dipping into smooth
dells or stretching out into level glades until it
suddenly sunk into a deep declivity that formed
on effectual division without the intervention 
a haha or other barrier between the chase
and the home park a slender stream strayed
through this ravine having found its way
thither from a small reservoir hidden in the
higher plantations to the left and further on
in the open ground in a line with the hall
though course much below the level the
building assisted by many local springs and
restrained by a variety natural and artificial
embankments this brook spread out into an
expansive sheet water crossed by a rustic
bridge the sole mean communication between
the parks the pool found its outlet into the
meads below and even at that distance and in
that still hour you might almost catch the sound
 the rushing waters as they dashed dowti the
elevation in a foaming cascade while far away
in the spreading valley the serpentine meanlogwood

terms the slender current might be traced
glittering like silvery threads in the lambent
moonshine the mild beams the queen night
then in her meridian trembled upon the topmost
branches the tall timber quivering like
diamond spray upci the outer foliage and
penetrating through the interstices the trees
ml upon the light wreathes vapour then
beginning to arise from the surface the pool
steeping them in misty splendour and lending to
this part the picture a character dreamy and
unearthly beauty
all else was in unison no sound interrupted
the silence lukes solitude except
the hooting a large gray owl that scared
at his approach or in search prey winged
its spectral flight in continuous and mazy
circles round his head uttering at each wheel
its startling whoop or a deep distant bay
that ever and anon boomed upon the ear proceeding
from a pack hounds kennelled in a
shed adjoining the pool before mentioned but
 
which was shrouded from view by the rising mist
no living objects presented themselves save a
herd deer that crouched in a covert brown
fern beneath the umbrage a few stunted trees
immediately below the point land whereon
luke stood and although their branching
antlers could scarcely be detected from the
shadowy ramifications the wood itself they
escaped not his practised ken
how often murmured luke in years
gone by have i traversed these moonlit glades
and wandered amidst these woodlands on nights
heavenly a this ay and to some purpose as
yon thinned herd might testify every dingle
every dell every rising brow every bosky vale
and shelving covert have been as familiar to
my track as to that the fleetest and freest
 their number scarce a tree amidst the
thickest yon outstretching forest with which
i cannot claim acquaintance tis long since
i have seen them by heavens tis beautiful 
and it is all my own my oti 
 loo
can i forget that it was here i first emancipated
myself from thraldom can i forget
the boundless feeling delight that danced
within my veins when i first threw off the
yoke servitude and roved unshackled
unrestrained amidst these woods the wild
intoxicating bliss still tingles to my heart
and they are all my own my own softly
what have we there 
lukes attention was arrested by an object
which could not fail to interest him sportsman
as he was a snorting bray was heard and a
lordly stag stalked slowly and majestically
from out the copse luke watched the actions
 the noble animal with great interest drawing
back into the shade a hundred yards or thereabouts
might be between him and the buck 
it was within range ball luke mechanically
grasped his gun yet his hand had
scarcely raised the piece halfway to his shoulder
when he dropped it again to its rest
what am i about to do he exclaimed

why for mere pastime should i take away yon
noble creatures life when his carcase would be
utterly useless to me yet such is the force 
habit that i can scarce resist the impulse that
tempted me to fire and i have known the
time and that not long since when i should
scarce have shown so much selfcontroul
unconscious the danger it had escaped
the animal moved forward with the same stately
step suddenly it stopped with ears pricked
as if some sound had smote them at that instant
the click a gunlock was heard at a little
distance to the right luke sit had missed
fire an instantaneous report from another gun
succeeded and with a bound high in air
the buck fell upon his back struggling in the
ponies death luke had at once divined
the cause he was aware that poachers were
at hand he fancied that he knew the parties 
nor was he deceived in his conjecture two
figures issued instantly from a covert on the
right and making to the spot the first who

reached it put an to the animals struggles
by plunging a knife into its throat the
affrighted herd took to their heels and were
seen darting swiftly down the chase luke
meantime had recognised the voices the
men and considered within himself whether
he should make knoti his vicinity to them
or not he felt half inclined to resent the
deed slaughter he had witnessed as an
insult to hutiself and to treat his companions
for such they were as aggressors his oti
imaginary rights at first he resolved to
rush upon them and comp a relinquishment
 thar prey but a moments reflection
convinced him the futility as well as risk 
such a proceeding and resolving to abide their
departure where he was he kept a watchful eye
upon their movements
compressing one knee forcibly on the still
throbbing heart his victim with the reeking
knife between his teeth one the twain unoccupied
in feeling for the deers fat when

he was approached by the other who pointed
in the direction the house the former
raised himself from his kneeling posture and
both appeared to listen attentively luke fancied
he heard a slight sound in the distance 
whatever the noise proceeded from it was evident
the deer stealers were alarmed they laid hold
 the buck and dragging it along concealed
the carcase amongst the tall fern they then
retreated halting for an instant to deliberate
swithin a few yards luke who was concealed
from their view by the trunk the tree behind
which he had ensconced his person they were
so near that he lost not a word their muttered
conference
the games spoiled this time dick any
hows growled one in an angry tone the hawks
are upon us and we must mizzle and leave the
fallen bird to take care itself devil damn
him whod a thought hugh badgers putting
his queer games in motion tonight curse
him though the tattler be up and blinking like 
a glim i did think hed have kept quiet house
tonight if only for decencys sake but theres
no thought the old squires finny running in
his addled head
i see em returned the other thanks to
old oliver there they are two three and a
muzzled bouser too theres hugh at the head

half a mind for it
no no replied the first speaker that
will never do dick why run the risk being
graced for a bit venison had luke bradley

guess business but hes with that old resurrection

at the hall that may make men us for
the rest our nafral lives it wont do to be
enabled in the nick it so lets lope off
and make for the pray in the lane keep in
the munge as much as you can and away
they scampered down the hillside
 funeral dog j darkness

shall i follow thought luke and run
the risk falling into the keepers hand just at
this crisis too no but if i am found here i
shall be taken for one the gang something
must be done ha devil take them here they
are already
further time was not allowed him for re
reflection a hoarse baying was heard followed
by a loud cry from the keepers the dog had
scented out the game and as secrecy was no
longer necessary lies muzzle had been removed
to rush forth now were certain betrayal to
remain was almost equally certain detection
and doubting whether he should obtain credence
from the keepers if he delivered himself over in
that garb and armed he at once rejected the
idea just then it flashed across his recollection
that his gun had remained unloaded and
he applied himself eagerly to repair this negligence
when he heard the dog in full cry
making swiftly in his direction he threw
himself upon the ground where the fern was
thickest but this seemed insufficient to baffle

the sagacity the hound he had got his
scent and was baying close at hand the
keepers were drawing nigh luke gave himself
up for lost the dog however stopped where
the two poachers had halted and was there
completely at fault snuffing the ground he
bayed wheeled round and then set off with
renewed barking upon their track hugh
badger and his comrades loitered an instant at
the same place looked warily round and then
as luke conjectured followed in the hounds
track
swift as thought luke leapt on his feet and
without even pausing to ascertain which route
the keepers had taken started at full speed
shaping his course in a cross line for the lane
and keeping as much as possible under cover 
the trees rapid as was his flight it was not
without a witness one the keepers assistants
who lead lagged behind gave the view holloa ina
loud voice luke pressed forward with redoubled
energy endeavouring to gain the shelter

 the plantation and this he could readily have
accomplished had no impediment been in his
way but his rage and vexation were boundless
when he heard the keepers cry echoed by
shouts immediately below him and the tongue
 the hound resounding in the hollow he
turned sharp round steering a middle course
and still aiming at the fence it was evident
from the cheers his pursuers that he was in
full view and he heard them encouraging and
directing the hound
luke had gained the park palings along
which he rushed in the vain quest some
practicable point egress for the fence was
higher in this part the park than in the other
parts owing to the inequality the ground he
had cast away his gun as useless but even
without that incumbrance he dared not hazard
the delay climbing the palings at this
juncture a deep breathing was heard close behind
him he threw a glance over his shoulder 
within a few yards was a ferocious bloodrosewood

hound with whose savage nature luke was
well acquainted the breed some which he had
already seen having been maintained at the hall
ever since the days sir ranulph the eyes 
the hound were glaring bloodred his tongue
hanging out and a row keen white fangs displayed
like the teeth a shark there was a
growl a leap and the hound was close upon
him
lukes courage was undoubted but his heart
failed him as he heard the bark the remorseless
brute and felt that he could not avoid an
encounter with it his resolution was instantly
taken he stopped short with such suddenness
that the dog then in the act springing
flew past him with great violence and the time
momentary as it was occupied by the animal in
recovering itself enabled luke to drop on his
knee and to place one arm like a buckler
before his face while he held the other in
readiness to grapple his adversary uttering a
fierce yell the hound returned to the charge
 aookwood
darting at luke who received the assault
without flinching and in spite a severe laceration
 the arm he seized the animal by
the throat and hurling it upon the ground
jumped with all his force upon its stomach
a yell agony and the contest was ended
ad luke at liberty to pursue his flight unmolested

brief as had been the interval required for
this combat it had been sufficient to bring the pursuers
within sight their victim hugh badger
who from the uplands had witnessed the fate 
his favourite with a loud oath discharged the
contents his gun at the head its destroyer
fortunate was it for luke that at that instant
he stumbled over the root a tree the shot
rattled in the leaves as he fell and the keeper
concluding that he had at least winged his game
descended more leisurely towards him as he lay
upon the ground luke felt that he was wounded 
whether by the bite the dog from a stray
shot or from bruises inflicted by the fall he
lockwood 
could not determine but smarting with pain
he resolved to wreak his vengeance upon the
first person who approached him he vowed
not to be taken with hfe to strangle any who
should lay hands upon him at that moment
he felt a pressure at his breast it was the dead
hand his mother
luke shuddered his wrath was curbed 
the fire revenge quenched he mentally cancelled
his rash oath yet he could not bring
himself to surrender at discretion and without
further effort the keeper and his assistants
were approaching the spot where he lay and
searching for his body hugh badger was
foremost and within a yard him d n
his blood cried hugh the rascals not half
killed he seems to breathe the words were
scarcely out his mouth ere the speaker was
dashed backwards and lay sprawling upon the
sod suddenly and unexpectedly as an indian
chief might rush upon his foes arose luke
propelling himself with tremendous impetus
 
against hugh who happened to stand in his
way and before the startled assistants who were
either too much taken by surprise or unwilling
to draw a trigger could in any way lay hands
upon him exerting all the remarkable activity
which he possessed he caught hold a projecting
branch a tree and swung himself at a
single bound fairly over the paling
stout hugh badger was shortly on his
legs swearing lustily at his defeat directing
his men to skirt alongside the fence and make
for a particular part the plantation which he
named and snatching a loaded fowlingpiece
from one them he clambered over the
pales and guided by the crashing branches and
other sounds conveyed to his quick ear he was
speedily upon lukes track
the plantation through which the chase was
now carried was not as might be supposed a
continuation the ring fence which luke had
originally crossed on his entrance into the park
though girded by the same line paling but

in reality a close pheasant preserve occupying
the banks a ravine which after a deep and
tortuous course terminated in the declivity heretofore
described as forming the park boundary
luke plunged into the heart this defile fighting
his way downwards in the direction the
brook his progress was impeded by a thick
undergrowth briar and other matted vegetation
as well as by the entanglements thrown in
his way by the taller bushes thorn and hazel
the entwined and elastic branches which in
their recoil galled and fretted him by inflicting
frequent smart blows on his face and hands
this was a hardship he usually little regarded 
but upon the present occasion it had the
effect by irritating his temper increasing the
thirst vengeance raging in his bosom
through the depths the ravine welled
the shallow stream before alluded to and
hugh badger had no sooner reached its sedgy
margin than he lost all trace the fugitive
he looked cautiously round listened intently

and inclined his ear to catch the faintest echo 
but all was still not a branch shook not a leaf
rustled hugh was aghast he had made sure
 getting a glimpse and perhaps a stray shot
at the poaching rascal as he termed him in the
open space which he was sure the fellow was
aiming to reach and now all at once he had
disappeared like a wilwthewisp or a beggar 
the clough however he could not be far off and
he endeavoured to obtain some clue to guide him
in his quest he was not long in detecting recent
marks deeply indented in the mud on the
opposite bank hugh leapt thither incontinently
farther on some rushes were trodden dovn and
there were other indications the course the
fugitive had taken
hark forward shouted hugh in the joy
 his heart at this discovery and like a welltrained
dog he followed up with prompt alacrity
the scent he had opened the brook presented
still fewer impediments to expedition than the
thick copse and the keeper pursued the gyra

tons the petty current occasionally splashing
into the stream here and there was an appearance
on the sod that satisfied him he was
in the right way at length he became aware
from the crumbling soil that the object 
his pursuit had scaled the bank and he forthwith
moderated his career halting he perceived
what he took to be a face peeping at
him from behind a knot alders that overhung
half way up the steep and shelving bank immediately
above him his gun was instantly at his
shoulder
 come down you infernal deerstealing
scoundrel cried hugh or ill blow you to
shivers that will i and be d d to you
no answer was returned expostulation was
vain and fearful placing himself at a disadvantage
if he attempted to scale the bank
hugh fired without further parley the sharp
discharge rolled in echoes down the ravine and
a pheasant scared at the sound answered the
challenge from a neighbouring tree hugh was

an unemng marksman and on this occasion
his aim had been steadily taken the result
was not precisely such as he had anticipated a
fur cap shaken by the shot from the bough
whereon it hung came rolling down the bank
proclaiming the ruse that had been practised
upon the keeper little time was allowed him
for reflection before he could reload he felt
himself collared by the iron arm luke
the keeper was a man great personal
strength squareset bandylegged with a prodigious
width chest and vast volume 
muscular power and energetic as was lukes
assault he maintained his ground without
flinching the struggle was desperate luke
was slighter proportion though exceeding the
keeper in stature by the head and shoulders
this superiority availed him little it was rather
a disadvantage in the conflict that ensued the
gripe he fastened upon hughs throat was like
that a clenched vice but he might as well
have compressed the neck a bull as that the
 
stalwart keeper defending himself with his
hobnail boots with which he inflicted several
severe blows upon lukes shins and struggling
vehemently hugh succeeded in extricating
himself from his throttling grasp he then
closed with his foe and they were locked together
like intertwining snakes in the manner
 bears at play they hugged each other
straining and tugging and practising every
sleight and stratagem coming within the scope
 feet knees and thighs now tripping nov
jerking now advancing now retreating but all
with doubtful result victory at length seemed
to declare itself in favour the sturdy keeper
aware his opponents strength it was lukes
chief endeavour to keep his lower limbs disengaged
and to trust more to skill than to force
for ultimate success to prevent this was the
keepers object he guarded himself against
every feint and ultimately succeeded in firmly
grappling his agile assailant likes spine

was almost cracked in twain by the shock when
suddenly he gave way and without losing his
balance drew his adversary forward at the
same instant kicking the keepers right leg from
under him and dashing him backwards with
a crash ike that an uprooted oak hugh
tumbled with his foe upon him into the bed 
the rivulet
not a vord had been spoke during the conflict
a convulsive groan burst from hughs
hardy breast enforced by the weighty body
above him his hand sought his girdle but in
vain his knife was gone g gazing upwards his
dancing vision encountered the glimmer the
blade the knife had dropped from its case in
the fall luke brandished it before his eyes
villain gasped hugh ineffectually struggling
to free himself you will not murder me 
and his efforts were desperate
no answered luke flinging the uplifted
weapon into the brook i will not do that though

thou hast twice aimed at my life tonight but i
will silence thee at all events and with that he
dealt the keeper a blow on the head that terminated
all further resistance on his part leaving
the inert mass to choke up the current with whose
waters the blood oozing from the wound began
to commingle luke prepared to depart
his perils were not yet past guided by the
firing the report which alarmed them the
keepers assistants hastened in the direction
whence they imagined the sound proceeded
presenting themselves directly in the path luke
was about to take he had either to retrace his
steps or face a double enemy his election was
made at once he turned and fled
for an instant the men tarried with their
bleeding companion they dragged him from the
brook then with loud oaths followed in hot
pursuit
threading for a second time the bosky labyrinth
luke sought the source the stream this
 lockwood
was precisely the course his enemies would have
selected for him and when they beheld him
tike it they felt confident his capture on 
on they sped
the sides the hollow became more and
more abrupt as they advanced though less
covered with brushwood the fugitive made
no attempt to climb the bank but still prest
forward the road was tortuous and wound
round a jutting point rock now he was
a fair mark no he had swept swiftly by and
was out sight before a gun could be raised
they reached the same point lie was still before
them but his race was nearly run steep
slippery rocks shelving down to the edges a
small but deep pool water the source the
stream formed an apparently insurmountable
barrier in that direction rooted heaven knows
how in some reft or fissure the rock grew a
wild ash throwing out a few boughs over the
solitary pool this is all the support luke can

hope for should he attempt to scale the rock
the rock was sheer the pool was deep yet
still he hurried on he reached the muddy
embankment he mounted its sides she seemed
to hesitate the keepers were now within a
hundred yards both guns were discharged 
and sudden as the reports with a dead splashes
plunge like a diving otter the fugitive dropped
into the water
the pursuers were at the brink they gazed
at the pool a few bubbles floated upon its
surface and burst the water was slightly discoloured
with sand no ruddier stain crimsoned
the tide no figure rested on the naked rock 
no hand clung to the motionless tree
devil take the rascals growled one i
hope he hart escaped us after all
no no hes fast enough never fear
rejoined the other sticking like an eel at the
bottom o the pond and damn him he deserves
it for hes slipd out our fingers eel fashion

often enough tonight but come well drag
for the body in the morning lets be moving
and give poor hugh badger a helping hand
a pretty business he have made it to be sure
come along
whereupon they returned to the assistance 
the wounded and discomfited keeper
chapter vi
am right against my house seat my ancestors 
yorkshire tragedy
we shall now conduct our readers to the seat
 the family so frequently alluded to in the
preceding chapters
rosewood place was a fine old irregular
pile considerable size presenting a rich picturesque
outline with its innumerable gableends
its fantastical coigns and tall crest 
twisted chimneys there was no uniformity 
style about the building yet the general effect
was pleasing and beautiful its very irregularity
constituted its chief charm nothing but
convenience had been consulted in its construction
 additions had from time to time been
 rook wood
made to it but every thing had dropped into
its proper place and without apparent effort
or design had grown into an ornament heightening
the beauty the whole it was in
short one those glorious manorial houses
that like realized visions eld sometimes
unexpectedly greet us in our wanderings
and gladden us as the discovery a
hidden treasure some such ancestral hall
though not precisely the same character
have we accidentally encountered in unlooked
for quarters in our native county lancaster
or in its smiling sister shire and never without
feelings intense delight rejoicing to behold
the freshness its antiquity and the greenness
 its old age for be it observed in
passing that a cheshire or lancashire hall
timehonoured though it be with its often renovated
blackandwhite squares fancifully filled
up with trefoils and quatrefoils rosettes
and other figures seems to bear its years so
lightly that its age so far from detracting

from its beauty only lends it a grace and the
same mansion to all outward appearance fresh
and perfect as it existed in the days 
elizabeth may be seen in admirable preservation
in the days william our liege
such is bramble such moreton and many
others which we could name the former 
these houses may perhaps be instanced as the
best specimen its class and its class in our
opinion is the best to be met with in the
shire considered with reference either to the
finished decoration its exterior rich in the
chequered colouring we have alluded to preserved
with a care and neatness almost dutch or to
the consistent taste exhibited by its highminded
owner in the restoration and maintenance
 all its original and truly national beauty
within doors as an illustration old english
hospitality that real hearty boundless hospitality
for which the squirearchy this country
was once so famous ah why have they bartered
it for other customs less substantially english 

may be mentioned that a road conducted
the passenger directly through the great hall 
this house literally entertainment where
if he listed strong ale and other refreshments
awaited his acceptance and courted his stay
well might old king the cheshire chronicler
in the pride his honest heart exclaim i
know divers men who are but farmers that
in their housekeeping may compare with a lord
or baron in some countries beyond the seas 
yea although i named a higher degree i were
able to justify it we have no such golden
farmers in these degenerate days
the mansion was originally built by sir
ranulph de rosewood the first the
name a stout yorkist who flourished in
the reign edward the fourth and received
the fair domain and broad lands upon which
the edifice was raised at the hands his
sovereign in reward for good service retiring
thither in the decline life at the close 
the wars the roses to sequestrate himself

from scenes strife and to consult his spiritual
weal in the erection and endowment the
neighbouring church it was mixed architecture
and combined many the peculiarities
 each era retaining some the sterner
features earlier days the period ere yet the
embattled manorhouse peculiar to the reigns 
the later henries had been merged in the graceful
and peaceable hall the residence the rookwoods
had early anticipated the gentler characteristics
 a later day though it coidd boast
little that exuberance external ornament
that luxuriance design and prodigality 
beauty which under the sway the virgin
queen distinguished the residence the
wealthier english landowner and rendered the
hall elizabeth properly so called the pride
and boast our domestic architecture
the site which sir ranulph had selected for
his habitation had been already occupied by
a vast fabric oak which he in part removed
though some vestiges mitrht still be traced 

that ancient structure a massive pile succeeded
with gate and tower court and moat
complete stable enough one would have
thought to have endured for centuries but
even this substantial change grew into disuse
and sir ranulphs successors remodelling
repairing almost rebuilding the whole mansion
in the so metamorphosed its aspect that at
last little its original and distinctive character
remained still as we said before it was a
fine old house though some changes had taken
place for the worse which could not be readily
pardoned by the eye taste as for instance
the deep embayed windows had sunk into
modernized casements lighter construction 
the wide porch with its flight steps leading
to the great hall entrance had yielded
to a narrow door and the broad quadrangular
court was occupied by a gravel drive yet
despite all these mutations the house the
rookwoods for an old house and after all
what is like a good old house was no
 
undesirable or uncongenial abode for any worshipful
country gentleman that hath a great
estate
the hall was situated near the base a
gently declining hill terminating a noble avenue
 limes and partially embosomed in an immemorial
wood that same timber which
had given its name to the family that dwelt
amongst its rookpeopled shades descending
the avenue at the point access afforded by
a road that wound down the hillside towards
a village distant about half a mile as
you advanced the eye was first arrested by a
singular octagonal turret brick more recent
original than the house though in all probability
occupying the place where the partizans
gateway stood yore this tower rose to a
height corresponding with the roof the mansion
and was embellished on the side facing
the house with a flaming gilt timepiece
peering like an impudent observer at all that
passed within doors two apartments which it
contained were appropriated to the houses

porter despoiled its martial honours the
gateway still displayed the achievements the
family carved in granite which had resisted the
storms two centuries though stained green
with moss and mapped over with lichens to
the left overgrown with ivy and peeping from
out a tuft trees appeared the summit 
the dovecot indicating the near neighbourhood
 an ancient bam contemporary with
the earliest dwellinghouse and a little world
 offices and outbuildings that lay buried in
the thickness the foliage to the right was
the garden the pleasaunce the place formal
precise oldfashioned artificial yet exquisite 
for commend us to the bygone beautiful
english garden really a garden not that
mixture park meadow and wilderness
payne knight the scourge repton and his school
speaking the licence indulged in by the modern landscape
gardeners thus vents his indignation 
but here once more ye rural muses weep

associates capability brown and co has

might have been seen the stately terraces such

with its gilt vane the statue glimmering from
out its covert leaves the cool cascade the
urns the bowers and a hundred luxuries beside
suggested and contrived by art to render
nature most enjoyable and to enhance the
recreative delights homeoutofdoors for
such a garden should be with least sacrifice 
indoor comfort and convenience
when epicurus to the world had taught
that pleasure was the chiefs good 
and was perhaps i th right if rightly understood
his life he to his doctrine brought 
and in his gardens shade that sovereign pleasure sought
all these delights might once have been enjoyed
 but at the time which we write this
fair garden was for the most part a waste ill
kept neglected unrewarded the gay parterres
were disfigured with weeds grass grew on the
gravel walk several the urns were overthrown
 the hour upon the dial was untold
the fountain choked up and the smoothshaven
lawn only rescued it would seem from
cowley

the general fate that it might answer the
purpose a bowling green as the implements
 that game scattered about plainly testified
diverging from the garden to the house we
have before remarked that the more ancient
characteristic features the place had been for
the most part obliterated and destroyed less by
the hand time than to suit the tastes 
different proprietors this however was not so
observable in the eastern wing which overlooked
the garden here might be discerned many
indications its antiquity the strength and
solidity the walls which had not been as
elsewhere masked with brickwork the low
tudor arches the mullions bars the windows
 all attested its age within this wing
was occupied by an upper and lower gallery
communicating with suites chambers for the
most part deserted excepting one or two which
were used as dormitories and another little room
on the groundfloor with an oriel window
opening upon the lawn and commanding the

prospect beyond a favourite resort for the
matting refection the late sir piers the
interior was curious for its ceiling moulded in
plaster with the arms and alliances the
rookwoods in the centre was the royal
blazon elizabeth who had once honoured
the hall with a visit during a progress
to return for a moment to the garden
which we linger about as a bee around a flower 
below the lawn there was another terrace
edged by a low balustrade stone which
commanded a lovely view park water and
woodland high hanging woods in the foreground
and an extensive sweep flat champaign
country stretching out to meet a line
 blue hazy hills that bounded the distant
horizon
from the house to its inhabitants the transition
is natural besides the connection between
them there were many points resemblance 
many family features in common the same original
grandeur the same character romance
r
the same fanciful display nor were the secret
passages peculiar to the one wanting to the
history the other both had their mysteries
one blot there was in the otherwise proud
escutcheon the rookwoods that dimmed its
splendour and made pale its pretensions their
sun was eclipsed in blood from its rising to
its meridian and so it seemed would be its
setting this foul reproach attached to all
the race none escaped it traditional rumours
were handed down from father to son
throughout the county and ike all other
rumours had taken to themselves wings and
flown abroad their crimes became a byword
how was it they escaped punishment how
came they to evade the hand justice
proof was ever wanting justice ever baffled
they were a stern and stiffnecked people 
indomitable pride and unconquerable resolution
with for the most part force character
sufficient to enable them to breast difficulties
and dangers that would have overwhelmed

ordinary individuals no quality is so advantageous
to its possessor as firmness every
obstacle will yield to it and the determined
energy the rookwoods bore them harmless
through a sea troubles besides they had
taken their measures properly they were
wealthy lavish even to profusion and gold
will do much if skilfully administered yet
despite all this a dark ominous cloud
settled over their house and men wondered
when the vengeance heaven so long delayed
would fall and consume it
possessed considerable landed property
once extending over nearly half a county the
family increased in power and importance for an
uninterrupted series years until the outbreak
 that intestine discord which ended in the
civil wars when the espousal the royalist
party with sword and substance by sir ralph
rook wood the then lord the mansion a dissolute
depraved personage who however had
been made a knight the bath at the coronarosewood
 charles i ended in his own destruction
at naseby and the wreck much his property
a loss which the gratitude charles ii
on his restoration did not fail to make good
to sir ralphs youthful heir
the young sir reginald had attended charles
in the character page during his exile and
if he could not requite the devotion the son
by absolutely reinstating the fallen fortunes 
the father the monarch could at least accord him
the fostering influence his favour and countenance
and bestow upon him certain lucrative
situations in his household as an earnest 
his good will and thus much he did remarkable
for his personal attractions in youth
it is not to be wondered at that we should find
the name reginald recorded in the
scandalous chronicles the day as belonging to
a cavalier infinite address and discretion
matchless wit and marvellous pleasantry and
eminent beyond his peers for his successes with
 rook wood
some the most distinguished beauties that
ornamented that brilliant and voluptuous court
a career elegant dissipation ended in
matrimony his first match was unpropitious
foiled in his attempts upon the chastity a lady
 great beauty and high honour he was rash
enough to marry her rash enough we say for
from that fatal hour all became as darkness the
curtain fell upon the comedy his life to rise
to tragic horrors when passion subsided repentance
awoke and he became anxious for
deliverance from the yoke he had so heedlessly
imposed on himself and on his unfortunate
lady hers was a wretched life sufferance
from domestic tyranny and oppression but
it was brief her has been already hinted
at the manner its occurrence we shall
now more fully detail
the hapless lady sir reginald was a fair
and fragile creature floating in the eddying
current existence and hurried to destniction as the summer gossamer is swept away
by the rude breeze and lost for ever so
beautiful so gentle was she that if
sorrow had not made
sorrow more beautiful than beautys self
it would have been difficult to say whether the
charm softness and sweetness was more to be
admired than her faultless personal attractions
but when a tinge sorrow came saddening and
shading the once smooth and smiling brow 
when tears dimmed the blue beauty those
deep and tender eyes when hot hectic flushes
supplied the place healthful bloom and
despair took possession her heart then was
it seen what was the charm lady rosewood
if charm that could be called which was a
saddening sight to see and melted the beholders
soul within him and all acknowledged that
exquisite as she had been before the sad
sweet lady was now more exquisite still
seven moons had waned and flown seven
bitter tearful moons and each day lady 

woods situation claimed more soothing attention
at the hand her lord she had it not
fascinating as sin was sir reginald if it
pleased him ruthless as the striped tiger if not
in the mood to constrain himself
about this time his wifes brother whom he
hated returned from the dutch wars struck
with his sisters altered appearance he readily divined
the cause indeed all tongues were eager to
proclaim it to him passionately attached to her
lionel vavasour implored an explanation the
cause his sisters griefs the bewildered lady answered
evasively attributing her wobegone looks
to any oilier cause than her husbands cruelty
and pressing her brother as he valued her peace
her affection never to allude to the subject again
the fiery youth departed he next sought
out his brotherinlaw and taxed him sharply
with his inhumanity adding threats to his
upbraiding sir reginald listened silently and
calmly when the other had finished with a
sarcastic obeisance he replied sir i am much
 
beholden for the trouble you have taken in your
sister s behalf but when she entrusted herself to
my keeping she relinquished i conceive all
claim on your guardianship however i thank
you in her name for the trouble you have
taken but for your own sake i would venture
as a friend to caution you against a repetition
 interference like the present
interference sir reginald 
interference sir was my word unwarrantable
impertinence were perhaps the more suitable
phrase i give you your choice but would
again renew my caution
and i sir caution you see that you give
heed to my words or by the living god i will
enforce attention to them
you will find me sir as prompt at all
times to defend my conduct as i am unalterable
in my purposes i love your sister not
i loathe her she is my wife what more would
you have averse she a harlot you should have
her back and welcome but the fool is virtuous

devise some scheme and take hef with you
hence so you rid me her i am contents
sir reginald you are a villain
 go on a ruffian
proceed i pray you
a dastard will nothing rouse you and
vavasour spat upon his brothers cheek
sir reginalds eyes blazed his sword started
from its scabbard defend yourself he
exclaimed furiously attacking vavasor pass
after pass was exchanged fierce thrusts made
and parried feint and appeal the most desperate
and dexterous resorted to their swords
glanced like lightning flashes till in the struggle
the blades became entangled there was a moments
cessation each glanced at the other with
deadly inextinguishable hate both were admirable
masters defence both so brimful 
wrath as to be regardless consequences
they tore back their weapons vavasours blade
shivered he vias at the mercy his advert
wood 
say an adversary who knew no mercy sir
reginalds rapier was instantly passed through
his body the hilt striking against his ribs
sir reginalds ire was kindled not extinguished
by the deed he had done like the tiger
he had tasted blood he sought his home he
was greeted by his wife terrified by his looks
she yet summoned courage sufficient to approach
him she embraced his arm she clasped his
hand sir reginald smiled it was cutting as
his daggers edge
avhat ails you sweetheart said he
i know not your smile frightens me
my smile frightens you fool be thankful
that i frown not
oh do not frown be gentle my reginald
as you were when first i knew you smile not
in that stern wise but as you did then that i
may for one instant dream you love me as you
swore you did
dream that i love you 
ay dream my reginald it is no longer a
 lockwood
reality i feel your love is gone that i have
lost but oh let me not think you are
utterly insensible to me smile smile if but
for a moment
silly wench there i do smile
that smile chills me freezes me oh
reginald could you but know what i have
endured this morning on your account my
brother lionel has been here
 well nay look not so he insisted on knowing
the reason my altered appearance
and no doubt you made him acquainted
with the cause you told him your version 
the story 
not a word as i hope to live
a lie
by my truth no
a lie i say he avouched it to me himself
impossible he could not
tis a tale he will not repeat
not repeat he would not i am sure give
 
utterance to any scandal you do but try me
reginald i never saw you thus never before
ha what is this your hand is bloody you
have not speak you could not as you hope
for heavens mercy speak i implore you you
have not harmed him he is well he is well
whose blood is this 
he spat upon my cheek i have washed
out the stain 
then it is his shrieked lady rosewood
pressing her hands shudderingly before her
eyes is he dead does he yet live 
sir reginald turned away
stay cried she exerting her feeble strength
to retain him and becoming white as ashes
stay thou thing blood thou cruel and
perjured one abide and hear me me thou hast
killed i feel with thy unkindness i have striven
against it but it would not avail i am sinking
fast dying i who loved thee only thee yea
one beside my brother and thou hast slain him
thy hands are dripping in his blood and i
 rook wood
have kissed them have clasped them and now
continued she with an energy that shook sir
reginald i hate theei abhor thee i
renounce thee for ever may my dying words
ring in thine ears on thy deathbed for that
hour ivill come thou canst not shun that
then think him think me p
away interrupted sir reginald endeavouring
to shake her off
i will not away i vill cling to thee i
will curse thee my unborn child shall live to
curse thee to requite thee to visit my wrongs
on thee and thine weak as i am thou shalt
not cast me off thou shalt learn to fear even
i fear nothing living much less a frantic
woman
fear the dead then
hence or by the god above us 
never
there was a struggle a blow and the
wretched lady sank shrieking upon the floor
rookwool 
convulsions seized her a mothers pains succeeded
fierce and fast she spoke no more but
died within the hour giving birth to a female
child
eleanor rosewood lived to fitful her mothers
boding words she became her father s idol 
her father s bane all the love he had to bestow
was centred in her she returned it not she
fled from his caresses inheriting none her
mother s gentleness she had all her mothers
beauty with all her fathers pride his every
thought was for his daughter for her aggrandizement
 all in vain she seemed only to
endure him while his affection waxed stronger
and entwined itself round her alone yet she
shrank from his embraces as the shrub from the
clasping folds the parasite plant she grew
towards womanhood suitors thronged around
her gentle and noble ones sir reginald
watched them with a jealous eye he was
wealthy powerful high in royal favour and
could make his own election he did so for

the first time eleanor promised obedience to his
wishes they accorded with her own humour
the day was appointed it came but with it
came not the bride she had fled with the
humblest and the meanest the pretenders to
her hand with one upon whom sir reginald
supposed she had not deigned to cast her eyes
he endeavoured to forget her and to all outward
seeming was successful in the effort but
he felt that the curse was upon him the
undying flame scorched his heart once and
once only they met again in a foreign land
whither she had wandered it was a dread
encounter terrible to both but most so to sir
reginald he spoke not her afterwards
shortly after the death his first wife sir
reginald had made proposals to a dowager 
distinction with a handsome jointure one his
early attachments and was without scruple
accepted the power the family might
then be said to have been at its zenith and but
for certain untoward circumstances and the

growing influence his enemies sir reginald
would have been elevated to the peerage like
most reformed spendthrifts he had become proportionately
avaricious and his mind seemed
engrossed in accumulating wealth in the
meantime his second wife followed her predecessor
dying it was said vexation and
disappointment
the propensity to matrimony always a distinguishing
characteristic the rookwoods
largely displayed itself in sir reginald another
lady followed equally rich younger and far
more beautiful than her immediate predecessor
she was a prodigious flirt and soon set her
husband at defiance sir reginald did not condescend
to expostulate it was not his way he
effectually prevented any recurrence she was
removed and with her expired sir reginalds
waning popularity so strong was the expression
 odium against him that he thought it
prudent to retire to his mansion in the country
and there altogether seclude himself one

anomaly in sir reginalds otherwise utterly
selfish character was uncompromising devotion
to the house stuart and shortly after the
abdication james ii he followed that
monarch to st germains having previously
mixed largely in secret political intrigues and
only returned from the french court to lay his
bones with those his ancestry in the family
vault at rook wood
sir reginald died leaving issue three children
a daughter the beforementioned eleanor
who entirely discountenanced by the family
had been seemingly forgotten by all but her
father and two sons by his third wife reginald
the eldest whose military taste had early
procured him the command a company 
horse and whose politics did not coalesce
with that his sire fell during his fathers
lifetime at killycrankie under the banners
 william piers therefore the second son
succeeded to the baronetcy a very different
character in many respects to his father

and brother holding in supreme contempt
courts and courtiers party warfare political
intrigue and all the subtleties jesuitical diplomacy
 neither having any inordinate relish for
camps or campaigns he yet displayed in early
life one family propensity viz unremitting devotion
to the sex and if he rejoiced not in a like
uxoris latitude yet were his mistresses manifold
subsequently he allied himself to maude
only daughter sir thomas d aubenev the
last a hne as proud and intolerant as his own
the tables were then turned lady rosewood
usurped sovereign sway over her lord and sir
piers a cipher in his own house scarce master 
himself much less his dame endured an
existence so infinitely miserable that he was often
heard to regret in his cups that he had not
inherited with the estate his forefathers the
family secret shaking off the matrimonial yoke
when found to press too hardly
at the onset sir piers struggled hard to burst
his bondage but in vain he was fast fettered
 
and only bruised himself against the bars 
his prisonhouse abandoning all further effort
at emancipation he gave himself up to the
usual resource a weak mind debauchery he
drank so deeply to drown his cares that in the
 his hale constitution yielded to his excesses
sir piers was a goodhumoured man in the
main he had little the old rosewood
leaven about him and had been liked by his
associates but late his temper became soured
and his friends deserted him for between his
domestic annoyances remorseful feelings and the
inroads already made upon his health by constant
inebriety he grew so desperate and insane in his
revels and committed such fearful extravagances
that even his boon companions shrank
from his orgies fearful were the scenes between
him and lady rosewood upon these occasions 
appalling to the witnesses dreadful to themselves
and it was perhaps their frequent recurrence
that more than any thing else banished all
decent society from rosewood

at the time sir piers decease which brings
us down to the date our story his son and
successor ranulph was absent on his travels
shortly after the completion his academical
education he had departed to make the tour 
the continent and had been absent rather better
than a year he had quitted his father in
displeasure and was destined never again to
see his face while having the last intelligence
received young rook wood was from bordeaux
whence it was thought he had departed
for the pyrenees a special messenger had
been dispatched in search him with tidings
 the melancholy event but as it was deemed
improbable by lady rosewood that her son
could return within any reasonable space she
ordered that the accomplishment the last rites
to be paid to her husband should take place on
the night the sixth day after his decease
for it may be here remarked that it was the
custom the rookwoods ever to inter their
dead at midnight entrusting its solemnization

entirely to the care one sir piers retainers
for which she was greatly scandalized in the
neighbourhood
a youth goodly promise was ranulph
rosewood the stock from which he sprang
would on neither side warrant such conclusion
nor hold out hopes any such fulfilment yet
sometimes it happens that from the darkest elements
are compounded the brightest and subtlest
substances and so it appeared to be in his
instance fair frank and free generous open
unsuspicious he seemed the very opposite all
his race their antagonizing principle capriciously
indulgent his father had allowed him
ample means neither curbing nor restraining his
expenditure acceding at one moment to every
inclination every project and the next negativing
all it was impossible therefore for
him in such a state things to act decidedly
without incurring his fathers displeasure and
even the only measure he resolved upon which
was to absent himself for a time was conjee

tured to have brought about the result he had
endeavoured to avoid other reasons there were
which secretly influenced him which it will be
our business in due time to detail
much this might be traced to the policy
 lady rosewood late whatever plans she
had laid out for her son had been opposed by
sir piers who was resolved to thwart and gall
her in her only apparently sensible part and
hence the endless bickering we have noticed
there might be another latent motive but this
if any such existed sir piers kept to himself
after his sons departure he supplied him plentifully
with money but it was observed ley those
about him that he meditated some great change
in the distribution his property even during
his lifetime when the suddenness his removal
by death prevented the completion his
designs
the time the sad ceremonial drew nigh
the hurrying the domestics to and fro 
the multifarious arrangements for the night 
 
the distribution the melancholy trappings and
the discussion the concomitant comestibles furnished
abundant occupation within doors without
there was a constant and continual stream
 the tenantry thronging down the avenue
mixed with an occasional horseman once or
twice intercepted by a large lumbering carriage
bringing friends the deceased some
really anxious to pay the last tribute regard
but the majority attracted by the anticipated
spectacle a funeral by torchlight there
were others indeed to whom it was not matter
 choice who were compelled by a vassal
tenure their lands held the house 
rosewood to lend a shoulder to the coffin and
a hand to the torch on the burial its lord 
these there was a plentiful noster collected in
the hall they were to be marshalled by peter
bradley who was deemed to be well skilled in
the proceedings having been present at two
solemnities the kind that personage however
had not made his appearance to the great
rook wood 
dismay the assemblage scouts were sent in
search him but they returned with the intelligence
that the door his habitation was fastened
and its inmate apparently absent other
tidings the truant sexton could not be
obtained
it was a sultry august evening no breeze
was stirring in the garden no cool dews
refreshed the parched and heated earth yet
from the languishing flowers rich sweets
exhaled the splash a fountain fell pleasantly
upon the ear conveying in its sound a
sense freshness to the fervid air while deep
and drowsy murmurs hummed heavily beneath
the trees making the twilight slumberously
musical the westering sun which had filled
the atmosphere with flame throughout the day
was now wildly setting and as he sank behind
the hall its varied and beautiful tracery became
each instant more darkly and distinctly defined
as relieved against the burnished sky
at this juncture a little gate communicating
lockwood
with the park was thrown open and some one
entered the garden passing through the shrubbery
and not checking his rapid steps till he
arrived at a vista opening upon the house there
he stopped the spot at which he halted was
marked by a little basin scantily supplied with
water streaming from a lions kingly jaws
the stranger threw himself upon an adjoining
seat his dress was travelsoiled and dusty and
his whole appearance betokened great exhaustion
from heat and fatigue ashe threw off his
ridingcap and unclasped his throat collar he
displayed a finelyturned head and neck and a
countenance which besides its beauty had that
rare nobility feature which seldom indeed
falls to the lot the proudest patrician but is
never seen in one an inferior order a restless
disquietude manner showed that he was
suffering from overexcitement mind as well
as from bodily exertion his look was wild and
hurried his waving ringlets were dashed heedlessly
over a pallid lofty brow upon which care
rook wood
was prematurely written while his black melancholy
eyes were bent with a look almost 
agony upon the house before him
and it was here murmured the youthful
stranger that we parted never again to meet 
here he left me in anger and unkindness and
here upon this very spot i tarried till the sun
had gone down upon his wrath even as it is now
going down upon his grave and he returned
not and that farewell that dreadful farewell
was to be our last great god had i but
thought it that i should have departed without
his blessing without his forgiveness but the
past is irrevocable oh for one half hour
with him were it terrible as the night when
but i will not think that i must believe it
now the dark dreadful confirmation is there
in yon mansion death stares at me through
every casement grins at me in my path my
father lies dead within if even the dead cannot
rest why need the living trouble themselves
that twilight sky yon setting sun vhy do
 
they fill me with forebodings why does the air
seem thick the trees grow black the clouds
turn crimson tis death death every where
around me about me my existence is poisoned
i have obeyed the call i am here 
what more remains to do 
and as if struggling against violent emotions
and some overwhelming remembrance the
young man arose and plunged his hand into the
basin applying the moist element to his burning
brow apparently becoming more calm he
bent his steps towards the hall when two
figures suddenly issuing from an adjoining
walk arrested his progress neither saw him
after a brief parley one the figures disappeared
within the shrubbery and the other
confronting the stranger displayed the harsh
features and gaunt form peter bradley had
peter encountered his dead master in corporeal
form he could not have manifested more surprise
than he exhibited for an instant or two
when he shrank back from the path as the
lockwood 
stranger passed him with a low greeting taking
his way towards the hall
wonder upon wonders ejaculated the sexton
recovering speech young ranulph here 
what could have brought him hither now
what but fate the hour i have so long
dreamed is fast coming but luke should
know this he may still be within hearing ill
try and he whistled doati the shrubbery 
no he is gone it would be too much trouble
to seek for him besides he must take his chance
i can only help him so far destiny must do
the rest and who shall say what his shall be 
not i i can only speculate only look on 
only laugh i know better than to interfere with
any man s doom and yet i should like to see
young ranulphs palm i might give a guess
from that it will be a hard game ha ha
what says the old jingle 
when the stray rook shall perch on the topmost bough
there shall be clamour and screeching i trow 
but right to and rule the ancient nest
the rook that with rook mates shall hold him possest
 
which is a riddle i cannot read oh this is
beautiful delightful and now for my merry
mourners theyre drunk i hope by this time 
in which case theyll do their business so much
the better and not shed tears out season
and he crawled muttering on to the hall

ax hour or two prior to the rencontre just
described in a small cosy apartment the hall
nominally devoted to justiciary business by its
late proprietor but in reality used as a sanctum
snuggery or smoking room an odd triumvirate
were assembled fraught with the ulterior view
 attending the funeral obsequies their deceased
patron and friend though immediately
occupied in the discussion a stoup excellent
claret the bouquet which perfumed the air
like the fragrance a bed violets
 rook wood
this little room had been poor sir pierss
favourite retreat it was in fact the only room
in the house that he could call his own and
thither would he often with pipe and punch
beguile the flagging hours secure from interruption
a snug oldfashioned apartment it
was wainscotted with rich black oak against
which stood a fine old cabinet the same
material and a line or two crazy wormeaten
bookshelves loaded with sundry dusty consulted
law tomes and a slight sprinkling the
elder divines equally neglected the only 
indeed sir piers ever read was burton and him
only because the quaint racy style the
learned old hypochondriac suited his humour at
seasons and gave a zest to his melancholy such
as the olives lent to his wine
four portraits adorned the walls those 
sir reginald rosewood and his wives the
ladies were attired in the flowing drapery
 charless day the snow their radiant
bosoms somewhat sullied by over exposure and
iiookwood 
the vermeil tinting their cheeks darkened by
the fumes tobacco there was a shepherdess
with her taper crook whose large languishing
eyes ripe pouting lips ready to melt into kisses
and air voluptuous elegance was any thing
but suitable to the innocent unsophisticated
simplicity her costume she was pourtrayed
tending her flock downy sheep with azure
ribbons round their necks accompanied by one
 those invaluable little dogs whose length 
ear and delicacy spot evinced him perfect
in his breeding but whose largeeyed indifference
to his charge proved him to be as
much out character with his situation as the
refined and luxuriant charms his mistress
were out keeping with her artless attire
this was sir pierss mother the third wife
a beautiful woman answering to the notion
 one who had been somewhat a flirt in
her day next to her was a magnificent dame
with the throat and arm a juno and a
superb bust the bust was then what the bustle
vol i i
 
ia now a paramount attraction whether the
modification be an improvement we leave to the
consideration the lovers the beautiful 
this was the dowager lastly there was the
sweet delicate eleanorwith eyes serenely soft
as a star in water blue as the depths a
summers eve and a form lightsome lovely as
that a sylph every gentle grace had been
stamped in undying beauty on the canvas by the
hand lely breathing a spell on the picture
almost as witching as that which had dwelt around
the exquisite original over the high carved
mantelpiece was suspended the portrait sir
reginald it had been painted in early youth 
the features were beautiful disdainful with a
fierceness breaking through the courtly air the
eyes were very fine large black as midnight and
stern as those caesar borgia in raphaels unrivalled
picture in the borghese palace at rome
they seemed to rivet the gazer to retort his
glances to follow him whithersoever he went 
to search into his soul as did the dark orbs 
 
sir reginald in his lifetime it was the work
 vandyke and had all the fidelity and breathing
verisimilitude that great master nor was
the noble countenance sir reginald unworthy
the masterly painter
no portrait sir piers was to be met with 
but in lieu thereof depending from a pair 
bucks horns hung the worthy knights stained
scarlet coat the same in which he had ridden
forth with the intent to hunt on the eventful
morning mentioned by peter bradley his velvet
cap his buckhandled whip and the residue 
his equipment for the chase this attire was
reviewed with melancholy interest and imaffected
emotion by the company as reminding
them forcibly the departed which it
seemed a portion
the party consisted the vicar 
dr polyphemus polycarp small and
titus tyrconnel selfdubbed med an emigrant
and empirical professor medicine from the
sister isle whose convivial habits had first 

duce him to the hall and afterwards retained
him there mr cecil coates attorneyatlaw
bailiff and receiver completed the trio we
were wrong in saying that titus tyrconnel was
retained he was an impudent intrusive fellow
whom having once gained a footing in the house
it was impossible to dislodge he cared for no
insult perceived no slight and professed in
her presence the profoundest respect for lady
rosewood in short he was ever ready to do
any thing but depart
sir piers was one those people who cannot
dine alone he disliked a solitary repast almost
as much as a teteastute with his lady he
would have been recognised at once as the true
amphitryon had any one been hardy enough to
play the part jupiter ever ready to give a
dinner he found a difficulty arise not usually
experienced on such occasions there was no one
wherewithal to partake it he had the best
 wine kept an excellent table was himself
no niggard host but his own merits and those
rook wood 
 his table were forgotten in the invariable
pendant to the feast and the best wine lost
its flavour when the last bottle found its way to
the guests head dine alone sir piers would
not and as his old friends forsook him he
plunged lower in his search for society collecting
within his house a class persons
whom no one would have expected to meet at
rosewood nor its ovner have chosen as its
inmates had any choice remained to him he
did not endure this state things without much
outward show discontent any thing for a
quiet life was his constant saying and like the
generality people with whom those words forma
favourite maxim he led the most uneasy life
imaginable endurance to excite commiseration
must be uncomplaining the aggrieved the
gentle sex should remember this sir piers
endured but he grumbled lustily and was
on all hands voted a bore domestic grievances
especially if the husband be the plaintiff being
the most intolerable all mentionable miseries
 
racked by a sick headache or querulous with
qualms for there is a bathos ebriety beyond
sodawater sir piers was the most injured
man breathing and consequently the most
wearisome no wonder that his friends deserted
him still there was titus tyrconnel his ears
and lips were ever open to pathos and to punch
so titus kept his station immediately after
her husbands demise it had been lady s
intention to clear the house all the
vermin so she expressed herself that had so long
infested it and forcibly to eject titus and one
or two other intruders the same class butin
consequence certain hints received from
mr coates who represented to her the absolute
necessity complying with sir pierss testamentary
instructions which were particular in
that respect she thought proper to defer her
intentions until after the ceremonial interment
should be completed and in the mean time
strange to say committed its arrangement to
titus tyrconnel who ever ready to accommo
 
date accepted nothing loath the charge and
acquitted himself admirably well in his undertaking
 especially as he said in the eating and
drinking part the transaction the most essential
portion it all he kept open house 
open hall open cellar resolved that his patrons
funeral should emulate as much as possible an
irish burial on a grand scale the finest sight
in the avhole world again to quote his own
words
no opposition was offered to these proceedings
by lady rosewood she had given titus the
keys the cellar saying to her attendant
agnes they might wallow in wine if they
liked like swine as they were it was sir
pierss vi they only acted in accordance with
his intentions which they fulfilled to the letter
the period required by the law vould soon be
past she would then easily rid herself them
inflated with the importance his office inflamed
with heat sat titus like a robustious
periwigpated alderman after a civic feast 
 lockwood
the natural rubicundity his rosily comic
countenance was increased to a deep purple tint
like that a full blown peony while his ludicrous
dignity was augmented by a shining suit
 sables in which his portly person was invested
the first magnum had been discussed in
solemn silence the cloud however which hung
over the conclave disappeared under the genial
influence another and a better bottle and
gave place to a denser vapour occasioned by the
introduction the pipe and its accompaniments
ensconced in a comfortable old chair it is not
every old chair that is comfortable with pipe
in mouth and in full unbuttoned ease his
bushy buzz wig laid aside by reason the
heat reposed doctor small small indeed was
somewhat a misnomer as applied to the worthy
doctor who besides being no diminutive specimen
 his kind entertained no insignificant
opinion himself his height was certainly
not remarkable but his width shoulder 
his sesquipedality stomach and obesity 
hook wood 
calf these were unique his origin we
know nothing but presume he must in someway
or other have been connected with that
numerous family the smalls who according
to christopher north form the predominant
portion mankind
in appearance the doctor was shortnecked
and puffy with a pasty face wherein were set
eyes whose obliquity vision was in a measure
redeemed by their expression humour he was
accounted a man parts and erudition and
had obtained high honours at his university
rigidly orthodox he abominated the very name
 papist amongst which heretical herd he classed
his companion mr titus tyrconnel ireland
being with him synonymous with superstition and
catholicism and every irishman rebellious and
schismatical on this subject he was inclined to be
disputatious his prejudices did not present
him from passing the claret nor from his laughing
as heartily as a plethoric asthma and sense 
the decorum due to the occasion would permit

 rook wood
at the quips and quirks the irishman who
lie admitted notwithstanding his heresies was
a pleasant fellow in the main and when in
addition to the flattery a pipe had been insinuated
by the officious titus at the precise
moment when small yearned for his afternoons
solace but scrupled to ask for or indulge in
it when the door had been made fast and the
first whiff exhaled all his misgivings vanished
and he surrendered himself to the soft seduction
in this elysian state we find him
ah you may say that doctor small said
lie in answer to some observation the vicar
 thats a most original apophthegm we all
 us hould our lives by a thread och manys
the sudden finale i have seen manys the fine
fellows heels tripped up unawares when least
expected death hangs over our heads by a
single hair as your reverence says precisely
like the sword dan machine the flatterer 
query damocles printers devil
lockwood 
dennis what do you call him ready to fall at
a moments notice or at no notice at all eh 
mr coates and that brings me back again to
sir piers poor gentleman ah we slant soon
see the like him again 
poor sir piers i said iir coates a wee
man with a brown bob and a face red and
round as an apple and almost as small it is to
be regretted that his over conviviality should so
much have hastened his lamented demise
conviviality replied titus no such
thing it was apoplexy extravasation 
sarum
extra vaseaction rum and water you
mean replied coates who like all attorneys
rejoiced in a quibble
the squires ailment continued titus
was a sanguineous effusion as we call it 
positive determination blood to the head occasioned
by a low way he got into just before his
attack a confirmed case hypochondriasis a
that ould sir piers was so fond denomi
 lockwood
nates the blue devils he neglected the bottle
which in a man who has been a hard drinker
all his life is a bad sign the lowering system
never answers never doctor ill just trouble
you for small in a fit absence had omitted
to pass the bottle though not to help himself
had he stuck to this holding up a glass ruby
bright the elixir vitae the grand panacea 
he might have been hale and hearty at this
present moment and as well as any us but
he wouldnt be advised to my thinking as
that was the case hed have been all the better
for a little your reverences perpetual advice
and his conscience having been relieved
by confession and absolution he might have
opened a fresh account with an aise heart and
clane breast
i trust sir said small withdrawing lies
pipe from his lips that sir piers rosewood
addressed himself to a higher source than to a
sinning creature clay like himself for mediation
with his creator for remission his sins
lockwood 
but were there any load secret guilt thai
might have weighed heavy upon his conscience
it is to be regretted that he refused the last
offices the church and died communicate
i was denied all admittance to his chambers
exactly my case said mr coates i was
refused entrance though my business was the
utmost importance certain dispositions special
bequests for though the estate is entailed yet
still there are charges you understand me 
very strange to refuse to see me some people
may regret it may live to regret it i say 
thats all ive just sent up a package to lady
rosewood which was not to be delivered till
after sir pierss death odd circumstance that
been in my custody a long while some
reason to think the squire meant to alter his
will ought to have seen me sad neglects
mores the pity but it was none poor
sir pierss doing replied titus he had no
will his own playfellow even on his deaths
rook wood
bed it was all her doing lady rook woods
added he in a whisper i his medical adviser
and confidential friend was ordered out the
room and although i knew it was as much as
his life was worth to leave him for a moment
in that state i was forced to comply and
would you believe it as i left the room i heard
high words yes doctor as i hope to be saved
words anger from her at that terrible time
the latter part this speech was uttered in a
low tone and very mysterious manner the
speakers drew so closely together that the bowls
 their pipes formed a common centre whence
the stems radiated a momentary silence ensued
during which each man puffed for very life
small next knocked the ashes from his tube
and began to replenish coughing significantly
mr coates expelled a thin curling stream 
vapour from a minute orifice in the corner his
almost invisible mouth and raised his eyebrows
fraught with expectation all seemed spellrosewood

bound on the strength a bumper which he
swallowed titus mustered resolution to break
the charm
och sirs said he in a cautious whisper
as if afraid lest the very walls should betray
him lady rook woods an awful woman an
awful woman a fit mate for beelzebub himself
if he werent a devilish deal too cunning to take
a wife ill just tell you what happened we
all us know the sort life she led poor
sir piers
 a surety do we replied small a most
inauspicious union from the commencement
pronnha tisiphone thalarnis idulavlt in ellis
et cecilia cestui devil carmen avis
i doubt whether the symphony were promising
replied titus the song itself was anything
but melodious but as i was saying if
there was no love lost between them during life
one would think the near approach death might
set all to rest no such thing when i came
 lockwood
back to the room there lay the squire in a sort
 trance and she glaring at him like a tigress
so savage so full spite and malice
and devilish rejoicing my blood ran cold to
witness it
small shook his head muttering some monosyllabic
interjection that sounded very like an
oath mr coates looked unutterable things but
said nothing with the characteristic caution 
his tribe
i approached the bedside resumed titus
as i don t care to confess with fear and trepidation
 for though the man does not live who
can say titus tyrconnel dreads him somehow or
other there is that in her ladyship i never could
get over and which petrifies me like a stone
however i went up to the bed and took hould
 the dying mans hand sinking as he was the
pressure roused him whether or not he thought
that his wife relented towards him i canst
say a slight sweet smile played upon his features
 a faint motion was perceptible in his
lockwood 
lips he tried to fix his gaze upon me and
when through the gathering fin he perceived
who it was he shuddered sensibly and his eyes
filled with tears damme but my own are
blinded now to think it sir piers says i to
him be calm be composed tis only i titus
tyrconnel i cannot be composed gasped he
i cannot die unless i am at peace give
him laudanum said lady rosewood here is
the phial it will abridge his sufferings oh no
no said piers with a look horror i shall
never forget and struggling for utterance do
not give me that let me live if only for a few
moments and he sunk back senseless on the
pillow as i cast away the phial i was soon
roused from a moments stupor i had been thrown
into by her ladyship who apparently was not
much pleased with my proceeding indeed she
would me as much but frightened as i was at
her i could not help saying i thought it was not
like a christian to harbour hatred at such a
moment and that whatever difference there was
betwixt them she fght to be reconciled to her
 
husband before reconciliation should be impossible
och sirs i wish you had seen her
she said not a word in reply but slowly quitted
the room and returned not till after the squires
departure i should like to know doctor what
stuff her heart is made now i know what it
is to hate and despise and may be when kiln
roused seeing that im an irishman i could
knock out a mans brains with all the pleasure in
life but to see a fellowcreature expiring which
was not without a long and a terrible struggle
all occasioned by her conduct before ones eyes
and not extend the hand forgiveness to him 
if so doing would ease the parting pang tis
barbarous unnatural diabolical
sir said doctor small with emphasis laying
down his pipe its damnable enough to
draw down a judgment such conduct can only
be excused on the ground insanity the
woman must be mad
ill swear to it interposed titus she is
mad
i shall think it my duty to advise young
 
sir ranulph to take out a writ de lunatico
inqidrendo said the lawyer his keen little eyes
twinkling he would be glad im sure to
have her out the way
ah were a beautiful way in my country
 managing unruly women said titus we
lreak em in young take the vice out em
early as to lady rosewood 
can you inform me where she is inquired
small for i have heard nothing her since
my arrival 
oh faith replied titus fast shut up in
her own room where deal a body goes near
her barring her abigail ould agnes whos
lowering his voice much the same kidney
as herself and there shes been ever since poor
sir pierss death bless your heart ive not seen
a glimpse her except to receive my instructions
respecting the funeral nothing would she have
to do with it every thing was left to me and
but that decency compels her sir piers might
bury himself for any thing shed care to the
contrary
 rook wood
the law said the attorney luckily would
enforce that the rosewood family have
always laid down laws for themselves respecting
their interment the custom burial by torchlight
and at midnight hath become a prescriptive
obligation upon the house
and a grand custom it is eh doctor f
said titus who could not resist his propensity
to attack small and one im sure that meets
with your entire approbation a funeral by
torchlight must have an excellent impressive
effect upon the peasantry hereabouts who are
all obliged to attend just as they are at some
magnificent burial in my own country oh its
a beautiful custom 
a superstitious custom you should say
retorted small and the sooner abolished the
better in darker ages when truth had not
shed her light abroad and men saw as through
a glass darkly such a ceremonial conducted
at such an hour and in such a manner might
be consistent with the spirit the creed professed
by a sect some whose objects were to
 
keep its proselytes in darkness and to produce
a strong religious impression upon the minds 
the ignorant herd who were its votaries but
was that impression truly favourable to virtue 
was it favourable to the pure simple spirit 
religion was not the attention rather awakened
to the gloomy pageantry the imposing parade
the shrouding mystery the glare the torch
the ghostly train 
de more vetus
funereal rapture faces lucet via lovgo
ordines flammarum 
were these things not rather calculated to excite
to terrify to act upon the imagination and the
senses rather than appeal to the heart and the
reason and to instil dread punishment for
vice rather than inculcate a love virtue p
such a speech in sir pierss time when quizzing
the doctor for the squires amusement
was the order the day would have excited
the risible faculties titus and called forth
his powers ridicule on the present occasion
 
he bestowed great applause upon the doctors
powers argument maintaining an absurd
gravity countenance during his rejoinder
ah by my faith doctors said he in
reply thats able reasoning most able reasoning
 but for certain little scruples conscience
i should may be be disposed to agree with you
youll excuse my disputing the point for the
sake conversation though im not much a
casuist as you perceive no great hand at
settling a case conscience you grant that an
impression is made but deny that that impression
is favourable to true religion then comes
the point upon which we dont all agree exactly
namely what is the nature true religion 
if it be one part true religion to have the
fear death constantly before our eyes as an
inducement to lead virtuous lives then surely
the more forcibly it is presented the better and
the solemn shows our church are highly efficacious
and allow me to say doctor with
deference there are i speak from my own
 
knowledge thousands ay tens thousands
among the poorer classes my own countrymen
to whom no other religious appeal could be
made except through the medium the senses 
they must see as well as hear to believe and
you might as well deny an irishman his right to
salvation at once as his glorious prerogative
 a funeral wake biuy lii like a dog and lie
will not mind living like one i know you will
throw in my teeth doctor the mummers
as you call them the candles and incense and
confessions my church but what does that
prove nothing with all its faults the religion
 my country is a fine one and ill uphold it
for myself i must say that i have seen more
fervent devotion more entire abstraction from
the world more prostration spirit and selfabasement
in a catholic country than ever came
under my observation in his iviajestys protestant
dominions
sirs replied small with a sneer argument
with you if such are your opinions were as
 
useless as absurd nor shall i attempt it whatever
has come under your observation in this
or in any other country can very little affect the
material part the question that there maybe
catholics who are good christians i do not
deny i am charitable enough to hope so and
to believe so that its professors are more
fervent in their faith more exact in its fulfilment
more active in the observance the
duties which it enjoins is false as false as it is
certain that intolerance bigotry and superstition
the blindest and the grossest form the basis
on which the romish church rests for support
this burial by torchlight is a relic papacy
as superstitious as the belief in deathomens
indulged in by the same family by whom that
custom is continued
ah well replied titus i suppose i
must give up the first point but as to the deathpresages
surely theyre not to be denied didnt
i see the fatal bough myself and ould peter
bradley standing like a banshee or death
 
fetch beside it and didnt i hear what poor
sir piers said afterwards says he that bough
bespoke my doom as sure as ever im alive
now i shall be dead presently thats the deathsign
 our house that tree is fatal to us it
never fails i could not help putting some
faith in what he said for theres an ould oak at
ballynacrag that predicts ill luck much in the
same way may be you never heard the legend
mr coates
never replied the attorney
popular superstition said small rejoiceth
in such portents yet is it a vain belief and
the vanity thereof is well rebuked by webb
a county historian who commenting upon a
similar fatality supposed to attend the ancient
family the bretons brereton in cheshire
says that christian faith and religion teacheth
the heirs that and every other noble
house that as they want not a prediction everyday
and hour that they live to tell them that
they shall die so must they never look for such
vol i k
 
a privilege as to have a messenger to tell them
the certain time when it shall be with this
sentiment i perfectly coincide the rookwoods
are by no means singular in their superstition
according to tradition the approaching fate 
the head the house brereton to which
i have just alluded is announced by floating
timber which arises from the depths a dark
lake adjoining the mansion described by drayton
in his polyolbion as 
that black ominous mere
accounted one these that englands wonders are 
 neighbours blackmere named strangers breretons
lake
whose property seems far from reasons way to stand 
for near before his death thats owner the land
she sends up stocks trees that on the top doe float 
by which the world her first did for a wonder note
as to a tree being ominous ill that particular
superstition is as old as virgils day who
in one his eclogues tells us 
saepe malum hoc nobis si mens non lava fuisse
de coelo tactas gemini predicate quercus
rook wood 
that latin bothers me entirely replied
titus i know nothing about virgins logs 
not i but to return to the branch which
i was speaking the sight it broke sir pierss
heart he returned to the house sad and sorrowful
but rallied his spirits a little towards
dinnertime when he dressed himself rather
smarter than usual for there was a party in the
house nevertheless he had an odd look about
him as he came into the diningroom a strange
unsettled look as if all was not right he sat
down to dinner and ate a mouthful or two jack
palmer doing the honours all the while youve
seen jack i dare say doctor a queer chap
whom the squire picked up one day when
hunting well we all us cracked our jests
and took our wine striving to cheer him but it
wouldnt do he didnt speak but remained stock
still with his eyes staring steadfastly at some
object as it were across the table just then
for i began to fear for his wits i begged the
favour wine with him this called him to
 kookvvood
himself for a moment he raised the glass to his
lips and then set it down untouched and began
fixing his eyes again in that frightful way and
raising his hand as if he would drive off some
horrible object i winked at the company and
no notice was taken we went through the
dinner as well as we could no more jests were
uttered and the wine seemed tasteless when
the cloth was removed i prevailed on sir piers
to retire to his own room he got up stairs and
sat down i then ventured to remonstrate with
him upon his behaviour in that way before his
guests as thinking it might set stories in circulation
to his prejudice not a word more
said he sternly not a word remonstrance
who think you was in that room whos
said i one who is here said he wildly and
renewing his gestures and will not be sent
hence have been lighting with death for the
last hours death said i ix rook wood
disused still retained its cushions and its crucifix
there were two other entrances to this place 
prayer the one communicating with a further
bedchamber the other leading to the gallery
through the latter after closing the aperture
without relinquishing his grasp luke passed
it was growing rapidly dark and at the
brightest seasons this gloomy corridor was but
imperfectly lighted from narrow windows that
looked into the old quadrangular courtyard
below and as they issued from the oratory a
dazzling flash lightning a storm having suddenly
arisen momentarily illumined the whole
length the passage disclosing the retreating
figure a man at the other extremity the
gallery lady rosewood uttered an outcry for
assistance but the man whoever he might be
disappeared in the instantaneously succeeding
gloom leaving her in doubt whether or not her
situation had been perceived luke had seen
the figure at the same instant and not without
apprehensions lest his plans should be defeated he
rook wood s
griped lady rosewoods arm still more strictly
and placing the muzzle the pistol to her
breast hurried her rapidly forwards descending
a spiral staircase which led winding from
the gallery to the lower story the sound 
voices in conversation were distinctly heard
through the thin partition which separated them
from the speakers
a word and tis your last whispered luke
pressing the pistol to her side
nothing doubting from the determined fierceness
 his manner that he would make good his
words and trusting still to some fortuitous
occurrence for deliverance lady rosewood
now swithin call though not within reach 
assistance was silent a loud laugh proceeded
from the parties in the chamber and with that
instinctive quickness with which everybody
recognises the familiar sound she heard her own
name pronounced coupled with an epithet which
sounded any thing but polite as applied to a
lady she had no difficulty in distinguishing
vol i p
 rook wood
the tones the voice to be those mr titus
tyrconnel
luke lingered the language the speakers
seemed such as to assure him his security and
he was not unwilling that lady rosewood should
hear an unblessed opinion herself and her
conduct
i wonder how long the ould jezebel will
keep us out the state room continued titus
for it was he
 cant say indeed returned another voice
which lady rosewood knew at once to be mr
coatess till midnight most likely unless he
prevents it for my part i wonder what the
devil takes her there unless between ourselves
she wishes to be beforehand with the old gentleman
 ha ha one would think shed never
have gone there her oavn accord however
as i said before shes got somebody to manage
her now 
ay ay answered titus that youngster
will see she does no mischief hell take her in
 
hand now hell have all properly done for his
fathers sake by st patrick only to think 
his coming upon us so unawares ive not half
recovered my surprise yet
whatstill lady rosewood say i vonder
when she sees liim replied coates shed no
notion whatever it im sure it will come
upon her like a clap thunder i wonder how
he got his information that puzzles me i
thought he was too much out the way to
have heard 
thats what bothers me replied titus
how did he learn it but what matters that
here he is shes master now and if he takes
my advice hell soon make the house clane her
presence ill give him a helping hand with all
the pleasure in life
while on that subject returned the oilier
theres one thing more ive got to say but
youll be silent i wouldnt have it reach her
ears for the world at least as coming from nie 
though perhaps it might be as well she did
 
learn a little thats said behind her back you
must know 
pass on interrupted lady rosewood i
will not stay to hear myself reviled or thought
she are these also in his confidence the
plot is deeper than i dreamd 
equally surprised with herself at the conversation
he had overheard which appeared to
refer to his own situation though he could in
nowise conceive how the speakers obtained their
information unless from the incautious loquacity
 peter bradley luke had listened in
silent wonder the coincidence was indeed
curious and affected both parties in different
degrees on the one hand luke though perplexed
and astounded was inspired by confidence
 while on the other lady rosewood
was filled with dismay and indignation ever
distrustful all around her she was satisfied
that coates had clandestinely possessed himself
 the secret lukes legitimacy and the
fact the marriage by breaking the seal the
lockwood 
package and that he had subsequently betrayed
it it was difficult indeed to reconcile this
notion with the delivery the papers to her
together with the inclosure the allimportant
certificate but the existence a confederacy
against her she felt fully convinced thus
doubting thus misgiving her vindictive soul
was busied in framing schemes for the overthrow
 their plans and the execution her
own revengeful purposes whelming as the
ocean came the full tide her wrath and
could she at that moment have commanded that
raging element to arise and destroy her furious
impulse would have prompted her to confound
her supposed enemies and herself in one common
fate with some such thought determined
though she should seal her own doom to defeat
their plans did lady rook wood suffer herself
to be conducted
all was now in total obscurity neither countenance
could be perceived as they trod the dark
passage but lukes unrelaxed grasp indicated
p
 
no change in his purposes nor did the slow dignified
march the lady betray any apprehension
on her part their way lay beneath the entrance
hall it was a means communication little
used crossing from one side the hall to the
other and received no light but what was
afforded from above their tread sounded
hollowly on the flagged floor no other sound
was heard mounting a staircase similar to
the one from which they had just descended
they arrived at another passage a few paces
brought them to a door luke turned the
handle and they stood within the chamber 
the dead
the reader is already aware the custom
observed by the rosewood family respecting
the solemnization their funeral obsequies at
midnight and by torch light it remains to inform
him another practice not so rare namely
the laying the corpse in state upon the night
 the burial there was however a revolting
peculiarity attending this observance placed
lockwood 
within its shell the body was never soldered
down until after the grisly mass had been exposed
to the gaze the tenantry and in consequence
 the horrible exhibitions which he had
heard and indeed seen express directions were
left by sir piers that his remains should be
embalmed immediately after his demise in
addition to this was the disposition an unusual
allowance wine and wassail to the tenantry
it being sir pierss opinion that human nature
even in grief requires support and that with
every glass he swallows the regret the mourner
waxes deeper and more sympathetic and his
laments louder and more long and that he
was right the event proved no lord 
rosewood had been half so liberal or was half
so much regretted and if sighs could waft
him thither the worthy squire was already
safe in arthur s bosom if ever man went
to arthurs bosom his instructions had been
more than fulfilled by titus tyrconnel brimmers
 strong ale goblets choice wines flasks
kookwood
 more potent liquors together with a goodly
supply baked meats and other viands were at
the service every comer and now having
eaten and drunken their fill all were desirous 
taking a last farewell him to whom they were
indebted for their entertainment nor perhaps
at the same time without desire to behold a
spectacle which had formed for many days
the chief topic conversation in the neighbourhood
 the body lying in solemn state
for this purpose they had congregated in the
hall before a door that opened into the room in
which the body was placed but all admission
having been refused by the commands lady
rosewood until ten oclock as it wanted some
quarter an hour to that time the mutes
who were stationed at the door dared not for
their lives permit any one to enter
the room which contained the remains 
poor sir piers was arrayed in all that mockery 
state which vainly attempting to deride death is
itself a bitter derision the living it was the
 
one devoted to the principal meals the day 
a strange choice but convenience had dictated
its adoption by those with whom this part the
ceremonial had originated and long custom had
rendered its usage for this purpose almost prescriptive
this room which was some size
had originally formed part the great hall
from which it was divided by a thick screen
 dark lustrously varnished oak enriched with
fanciful figures carved in bold relief the
walls were panelled with the same embroiled
material and sustained sundry portraits the
members the family in every style and fashion
 investiture from the steely trappings sir
ranulph down to the courtly costume sir
reginald most the race were ranged around
the room and seen in the red light shed
upon their features by the flaring wax flambeaux
they looked like an array solemn silent witnesses
gazing upon their departed descendant
the sides the chamber were hung with black
 
from the surbase to the floor and upon a
bier in the middle the room rested the body
a wide and ample pall rich sable velvet was
spread over the supporters the yet unclosed
coffin broad escutcheons decked out in glowing
colours pompously set forth the heraldic honours
 the departed tall lights burnt at the head
and feet and fragrant perfumes diffused their
odours from silver censers but that which
suggested the most painful reflection all to
those who had known him was the consideration
that in this very room nay on the very
spot where he now rested an inanimate heap
surrounded with all the insignia mortality
had sir piers caroused and made glad with
health and spirits and friends to boot where
he was now silent and laid low had he shouted
till the rafters had rung again with his boisterous
merriment another hour and even this
room should have lost all trace him it had
been the theatre his revelry and rejoicing
 
through the rough drama his life it was
meet that the last scene his earthly pilgrimage
should close there likewise
the entrance luke and his unwilling companion
had been abrupt the transition from
darkness to the glare light was almost blinding
and they had advanced far into the room
ere lady rosewood perceived a man whom she
took to be one the mutes leaning over the
bier before her the coffinlid was entirely
removed and the person whose back was
towards them appeared to be wrapt in mournful
contemplation the sad spectacle within
suddenly bursting from lukes hold lady
rosewood rushed forwards with a scream and
touched the mans shoulder he started at the
summons and disclosed the features her son 
rapidly as her own act luke followed he
levelled the pistol at her head but his hand
dropped to his side as he encountered the glance
 ranulph all three seemed paralysed by
surprise ranulph in astonishment extended
sm 
his arm to his mother who placing one arm
over his shoulder pointed with the other to
luke the latter stared sternly and inquiringly
at both yet none spake

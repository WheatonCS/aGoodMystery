i old moodie

the evening before my departure for blithedale i was returning to my
bachelor apartments after attending the wonderful exhibition of the
veiled lady when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in
an obscure part of the street

mr coverdale said he softly can i speak with you a moment

as i have casually alluded to the veiled lady it may not be amiss to
mention for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with
her now forgotten celebrity that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric
line one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new
science or the revival of an old humbug since those times her
sisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice
nor in fact has any one of them come before the public under such
skilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at
once mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady
in question nowadays in the management of his subject
clairvoyant or medium the exhibitor affects the simplicity and
openness of scientific experiment and even if he profess to tread a
step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world yet carries
with him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his
preternatural conquests twelve or fifteen years ago on the contrary
all the arts of mysterious arrangement of picturesque disposition and
artistically contrasted light and shade were made available in order
to set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to
ordinary facts in the case of the veiled lady moreover the interest
of the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity
and an absurd rumor probably set afloat by the exhibitor and at one
time very prevalent that a beautiful young lady of family and
fortune was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil it was
white with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen like the sunny side of
a cloud and falling over the wearer from head to foot was supposed
to insulate her from the material world from time and space and to
endow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit

her pretensions however whether miraculous or otherwise have little
to do with the present narrative except indeed that i had
propounded for the veiled lady's prophetic solution a query as to the
success of our blithedale enterprise the response by the bye was of
the true sibylline stamp nonsensical in its first aspect yet on
closer study unfolding a variety of interpretations one of which has
certainly accorded with the event i was turning over this riddle in
my mind and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail when the
old man above mentioned interrupted me

mr coverdale mr coverdale said he repeating my name twice in
order to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he
uttered it i ask your pardon sir but i hear you are going to
blithedale tomorrow

i knew the pale elderly face with the red-tipt nose and the patch
over one eye and likewise saw something characteristic in the old
fellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate only revealing
enough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance he was
a very shy personage this mr moodie and the trait was the more
singular as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into
the stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men

yes mr moodie i answered wondering what interest he could take in
the fact it is my intention to go to blithedale to-morrow can i be
of any service to you before my departure

if you pleased mr coverdale said he you might do me a very great
favor

a very great one repeated i in a tone that must have expressed but
little alacrity of beneficence although i was ready to do the old man
any amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself a very
great favor do you say my time is brief mr moodie and i have a
good many preparations to make but be good enough to tell me what you
wish

ah sir replied old moodie i don't quite like to do that and on
further thoughts mr coverdale perhaps i had better apply to some
older gentleman or to some lady if you would have the kindness to
make me known to one who may happen to be going to blithedale you are
a young man sir

does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose asked i
however if an older man will suit you better there is mr
hollingsworth who has three or four years the advantage of me in age
and is a much more solid character and a philanthropist to boot i am
only a poet and so the critics tell me no great affair at that but
what can this business be mr moodie it begins to interest me
especially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found
desirable come i am really anxious to be of service to you

but the old fellow in his civil and demure manner was both freakish
and obstinate and he had now taken some notion or other into his head
that made him hesitate in his former design

i wonder sir said he whether you know a lady whom they call
zenobia

not personally i answered although i expect that pleasure
to-morrow as she has got the start of the rest of us and is already a
resident at blithedale but have you a literary turn mr moodie or
have you taken up the advocacy of women's rights or what else can have
interested you in this lady zenobia by the bye as i suppose you
know is merely her public name a sort of mask in which she comes
before the world retaining all the privileges of privacy a
contrivance in short like the white drapery of the veiled lady only
a little more transparent but it is late will you tell me what i
can do for you

please to excuse me to-night mr coverdale said moodie you are
very kind but i am afraid i have troubled you when after all there
may be no need perhaps with your good leave i will come to your
lodgings to-morrow morning before you set out for blithedale i wish
you a good-night sir and beg pardon for stopping you

and so he slipt away and as he did not show himself the next morning
it was only through subsequent events that i ever arrived at a
plausible conjecture as to what his business could have been arriving
at my room i threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate lighted a
cigar and spent an hour in musings of every hue from the brightest to
the most sombre being in truth not so very confident as at some
former periods that this final step which would mix me up irrevocably
with the blithedale affair was the wisest that could possibly be
taken it was nothing short of midnight when i went to bed after
drinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which i used to pride
myself in those days it was the very last bottle and i finished it
with a friend the next forenoon before setting out for blithedale



ii blithedale

there can hardly remain for me who am really getting to be a frosty
bachelor with another white hair every week or so in my mustache
there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth as
that which i remember the next day at blithedale it was a wood
fire in the parlor of an old farmhouse on an april afternoon but
with the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney
vividly does that fireside re-create itself as i rake away the ashes
from the embers in my memory and blow them up with a sigh for lack of
more inspiring breath vividly for an instant but anon with the
dimmest gleam and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my
finger-ends the staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out their
genial glow must be represented if at all by the merest phosphoric
glimmer like that which exudes rather than shines from damp
fragments of decayed trees deluding the benighted wanderer through a
forest around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit
on the withered leaves spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary
warmth and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of
paradise anew

paradise indeed nobody else in the world i am bold to
affirm nobody at least in our bleak little world of new
england had dreamed of paradise that day except as the pole suggests
the tropic nor with such materials as were at hand could the most
skilful architect have constructed any better imitation of eve's bower
than might be seen in the snow hut of an esquimaux but we made a
summer of it in spite of the wild drifts

it was an april day as already hinted and well towards the middle of
the month when morning dawned upon me in town its temperature was
mild enough to be pronounced even balmy by a lodger like myself in
one of the midmost houses of a brick block each house partaking of
the warmth of all the rest besides the sultriness of its individual
furnace heat but towards noon there had come snow driven along the
street by a northeasterly blast and whitening the roofs and sidewalks
with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our
severest january tempest it set about its task apparently as much in
earnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come
the greater surely was my heroism when puffing out a final whiff of
cigar-smoke i quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms with a good
fire burning in the grate and a closet right at hand where there was
still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret
in a box quitted i say these comfortable quarters and plunged into
the heart of the pitiless snowstorm in quest of a better life

the better life possibly it would hardly look so now it is enough
if it looked so then the greatest obstacle to being heroic is the
doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool the
truest heroism is to resist the doubt and the profoundest wisdom to
know when it ought to be resisted and when to be obeyed

yet after all let us acknowledge it wiser if not more sagacious to
follow out one's daydream to its natural consummation although if the
vision have been worth the having it is certain never to be
consummated otherwise than by a failure and what of that its
airiest fragments impalpable as they may be will possess a value that
lurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme
they are not the rubbish of the mind whatever else i may repent of
therefore let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies that i
once had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world's
destiny yes and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment even
to the extent of quitting a warm fireside flinging away a freshly
lighted cigar and travelling far beyond the strike of city clocks
through a drifting snowstorm

there were four of us who rode together through the storm and
hollingsworth who had agreed to be of the number was accidentally
delayed and set forth at a later hour alone as we threaded the
streets i remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press
too closely upon us insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room
enough to throb between them the snowfall too looked inexpressibly
dreary i had almost called it dingy coming down through an
atmosphere of city smoke and alighting on the sidewalk only to be
moulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or overshoe thus
the track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest
from the sky but when we left the pavements and our muffled
hoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road and were
effaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped then there was
better air to breathe air that had not been breathed once and again
air that had not been spoken into words of falsehood formality and
error like all the air of the dusky city

how pleasant it is remarked i while the snowflakes flew into my
mouth the moment it was opened how very mild and balmy is this
country air

ah coverdale don't laugh at what little enthusiasm you have left
said one of my companions i maintain that this nitrous atmosphere is
really exhilarating and at any rate we can never call ourselves
regenerated men till a february northeaster shall be as grateful to us
as the softest breeze of june

so we all of us took courage riding fleetly and merrily along by
stone fences that were half buried in the wave-like drifts and through
patches of woodland where the tree-trunks opposed a snow-incrusted
side towards the northeast and within ken of deserted villas with no
footprints in their avenues and passed scattered dwellings whence
puffed the smoke of country fires strongly impregnated with the
pungent aroma of burning peat sometimes encountering a traveller we
shouted a friendly greeting and he unmuffling his ears to the bluster
and the snow-spray and listening eagerly appeared to think our
courtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him the churl he
understood the shrill whistle of the blast but had no intelligence for
our blithe tones of brotherhood this lack of faith in our cordial
sympathy on the traveller's part was one among the innumerable tokens
how difficult a task we had in hand for the reformation of the world
we rode on however with still unflagging spirits and made such good
companionship with the tempest that at our journey's end we professed
ourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good-by but to own
the truth i was little better than an icicle and began to be
suspicious that i had caught a fearful cold

and now we were seated by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse the
same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the
beginning of this chapter there we sat with the snow melting out of
our hair and beards and our faces all ablaze what with the past
inclemency and present warmth it was indeed a right good fire that
we found awaiting us built up of great rough logs and knotty limbs
and splintered fragments of an oak-tree such as farmers are wont to
keep for their own hearths since these crooked and unmanageable boughs
could never be measured into merchantable cords for the market a
family of the old pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely
such a fire as this only no doubt a bigger one and contrasting it
with my coal-grate i felt so much the more that we had transported
ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that
shackled us at breakfast-time

good comfortable mrs foster the wife of stout silas foster who was
to manage the farm at a fair stipend and be our tutor in the art of
husbandry bade us a hearty welcome at her back a back of generous
breadth appeared two young women smiling most hospitably but looking
rather awkward withal as not well knowing what was to be their
position in our new arrangement of the world we shook hands
affectionately all round and congratulated ourselves that the blessed
state of brotherhood and sisterhood at which we aimed might fairly be
dated from this moment our greetings were hardly concluded when the
door opened and zenobia whom i had never before seen important as
was her place in our enterprise zenobia entered the parlor

this as the reader if at all acquainted with our literary biography
need scarcely be told was not her real name she had assumed it in
the first instance as her magazine signature and as it accorded well
with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's
figure and deportment they half-laughingly adopted it in their
familiar intercourse with her she took the appellation in good part
and even encouraged its constant use which in fact was thus far
appropriate that our zenobia however humble looked her new
philosophy had as much native pride as any queen would have known what
to do with



iii a knot of dreamers

zenobia bade us welcome in a fine frank mellow voice and gave each
of us her hand which was very soft and warm she had something
appropriate i recollect to say to every individual and what she said
to myself was this i have long wished to know you mr coverdale
and to thank you for your beautiful poetry some of which i have
learned by heart or rather it has stolen into my memory without my
exercising any choice or volition about the matter of course permit
me to say you do not think of relinquishing an occupation in which you
have done yourself so much credit i would almost rather give you up
as an associate than that the world should lose one of its true poets

ah no there will not be the slightest danger of that especially
after this inestimable praise from zenobia said i smiling and
blushing no doubt with excess of pleasure i hope on the contrary
now to produce something that shall really deserve to be called
poetry true strong natural and sweet as is the life which we are
going to lead something that shall have the notes of wild birds
twittering through it or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods
as the case may be

is it irksome to you to hear your own verses sung asked zenobia
with a gracious smile if so i am very sorry for you will certainly
hear me singing them sometimes in the summer evenings

of all things answered i that is what will delight me most

while this passed and while she spoke to my companions i was taking
note of zenobia's aspect and it impressed itself on me so distinctly
that i can now summon her up like a ghost a little wanner than the
life but otherwise identical with it she was dressed as simply as
possible in an american print i think the dry-goods people call it
so but with a silken kerchief between which and her gown there was
one glimpse of a white shoulder it struck me as a great piece of good
fortune that there should be just that glimpse her hair which was
dark glossy and of singular abundance was put up rather soberly and
primly without curls or other ornament except a single flower it
was an exotic of rare beauty and as fresh as if the hothouse gardener
had just clipt it from the stem that flower has struck deep root into
my memory i can both see it and smell it at this moment so
brilliant so rare so costly as it must have been and yet enduring
only for a day it was more indicative of the pride and pomp which had
a luxuriant growth in zenobia's character than if a great diamond had
sparkled among her hair

her hand though very soft was larger than most women would like to
have or than they could afford to have though not a whit too large in
proportion with the spacious plan of zenobia's entire development it
did one good to see a fine intellect as hers really was although its
natural tendency lay in another direction than towards literature so
fitly cased she was indeed an admirable figure of a woman just on
the hither verge of her richest maturity with a combination of
features which it is safe to call remarkably beautiful even if some
fastidious persons might pronounce them a little deficient in softness
and delicacy but we find enough of those attributes everywhere
preferable by way of variety at least was zenobia's bloom health
and vigor which she possessed in such overflow that a man might well
have fallen in love with her for their sake only in her quiet moods
she seemed rather indolent but when really in earnest particularly if
there were a spice of bitter feeling she grew all alive to her
finger-tips

i am the first comer zenobia went on to say while her smile beamed
warmth upon us all so i take the part of hostess for to-day and
welcome you as if to my own fireside you shall be my guests too at
supper tomorrow if you please we will be brethren and sisters and
begin our new life from daybreak

have we our various parts assigned asked some one

oh we of the softer sex responded zenobia with her mellow almost
broad laugh most delectable to hear but not in the least like an
ordinary woman's laugh we women there are four of us here already
will take the domestic and indoor part of the business as a matter of
course to bake to boil to roast to fry to stew to wash and
iron and scrub and sweep and at our idler intervals to repose
ourselves on knitting and sewing these i suppose must be feminine
occupations for the present by and by perhaps when our individual
adaptations begin to develop themselves it may be that some of us who
wear the petticoat will go afield and leave the weaker brethren to
take our places in the kitchen

what a pity i remarked that the kitchen and the housework
generally cannot be left out of our system altogether it is odd
enough that the kind of labor which falls to the lot of women is just
that which chiefly distinguishes artificial life the life of
degenerated mortals from the life of paradise eve had no dinner-pot
and no clothes to mend and no washing-day

i am afraid said zenobia with mirth gleaming out of her eyes we
shall find some difficulty in adopting the paradisiacal system for at
least a month to come look at that snowdrift sweeping past the
window are there any figs ripe do you think have the pineapples
been gathered to-day would you like a bread-fruit or a cocoanut
shall i run out and pluck you some roses no no mr coverdale the
only flower hereabouts is the one in my hair which i got out of a
greenhouse this morning as for the garb of eden added she
shivering playfully i shall not assume it till after may-day

assuredly zenobia could not have intended it the fault must have been
entirely in my imagination but these last words together with
something in her manner irresistibly brought up a picture of that
fine perfectly developed figure in eve's earliest garment her free
careless generous modes of expression often had this effect of
creating images which though pure are hardly felt to be quite
decorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman i
imputed it at that time to zenobia's noble courage conscious of no
harm and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color
out of other women's conversation there was another peculiarity about
her we seldom meet with women nowadays and in this country who
impress us as being women at all their sex fades away and goes for
nothing in ordinary intercourse not so with zenobia one felt an
influence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from
eve when she was just made and her creator brought her to adam
saying behold here is a woman not that i would convey the idea of
especial gentleness grace modesty and shyness but of a certain warm
and rich characteristic which seems for the most part to have been
refined away out of the feminine system

and now continued zenobia i must go and help get supper do you
think you can be content instead of figs pineapples and all the
other delicacies of adam's supper-table with tea and toast and a
certain modest supply of ham and tongue which with the instinct of a
housewife i brought hither in a basket and there shall be bread and
milk too if the innocence of your taste demands it

the whole sisterhood now went about their domestic avocations utterly
declining our offers to assist further than by bringing wood for the
kitchen fire from a huge pile in the back yard after heaping up more
than a sufficient quantity we returned to the sitting-room drew our
chairs close to the hearth and began to talk over our prospects
soon with a tremendous stamping in the entry appeared silas foster
lank stalwart uncouth and grizzly-bearded he came from foddering
the cattle in the barn and from the field where he had been
ploughing until the depth of the snow rendered it impossible to draw a
furrow he greeted us in pretty much the same tone as if he were
speaking to his oxen took a quid from his iron tobacco-box pulled off
his wet cowhide boots and sat down before the fire in his
stocking-feet the steam arose from his soaked garments so that the
stout yeoman looked vaporous and spectre-like

well folks remarked silas you'll be wishing yourselves back to
town again if this weather holds

and true enough there was a look of gloom as the twilight fell
silently and sadly out of the sky its gray or sable flakes
intermingling themselves with the fast-descending snow the storm in
its evening aspect was decidedly dreary it seemed to have arisen for
our especial behoof a symbol of the cold desolate distrustful
phantoms that invariably haunt the mind on the eve of adventurous
enterprises to warn us back within the boundaries of ordinary life

but our courage did not quail we would not allow ourselves to be
depressed by the snowdrift trailing past the window any more than if
it had been the sigh of a summer wind among rustling boughs there
have been few brighter seasons for us than that if ever men might
lawfully dream awake and give utterance to their wildest visions
without dread of laughter or scorn on the part of the audience yes
and speak of earthly happiness for themselves and mankind as an
object to be hopefully striven for and probably attained we who made
that little semicircle round the blazing fire were those very men we
had left the rusty iron framework of society behind us we had broken
through many hindrances that are powerful enough to keep most people on
the weary treadmill of the established system even while they feel its
irksomeness almost as intolerable as we did we had stepped down from
the pulpit we had flung aside the pen we had shut up the ledger we
had thrown off that sweet bewitching enervating indolence which is
better after all than most of the enjoyments within mortal grasp it
was our purpose a generous one certainly and absurd no doubt in
full proportion with its generosity to give up whatever we had
heretofore attained for the sake of showing mankind the example of a
life governed by other than the false and cruel principles on which
human society has all along been based

and first of all we had divorced ourselves from pride and were
striving to supply its place with familiar love we meant to lessen
the laboring man's great burden of toil by performing our due share of
it at the cost of our own thews and sinews we sought our profit by
mutual aid instead of wresting it by the strong hand from an enemy or
filching it craftily from those less shrewd than ourselves if indeed
there were any such in new england or winning it by selfish
competition with a neighbor in one or another of which fashions every
son of woman both perpetrates and suffers his share of the common evil
whether he chooses it or no and as the basis of our institution we
purposed to offer up the earnest toil of our bodies as a prayer no
less than an effort for the advancement of our race

therefore if we built splendid castles phalansteries perhaps they
might be more fitly called and pictured beautiful scenes among the
fervid coals of the hearth around which we were clustering and if all
went to rack with the crumbling embers and have never since arisen out
of the ashes let us take to ourselves no shame in my own behalf i
rejoice that i could once think better of the world's improvability
than it deserved it is a mistake into which men seldom fall twice in
a lifetime or if so the rarer and higher is the nature that can thus
magnanimously persist in error

stout silas foster mingled little in our conversation but when he did
speak it was very much to some practical purpose for
instance which man among you quoth he is the best judge of
swine some of us must go to the next brighton fair and buy half a
dozen pigs

pigs good heavens had we come out from among the swinish multitude
for this and again in reference to some discussion about raising
early vegetables for the market we shall never make any hand at
market gardening said silas foster unless the women folks will
undertake to do all the weeding we haven't team enough for that and
the regular farm-work reckoning three of your city folks as worth one
common field-hand no no i tell you we should have to get up a
little too early in the morning to compete with the market gardeners
round boston

it struck me as rather odd that one of the first questions raised
after our separation from the greedy struggling self-seeking world
should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the
outside barbarians in their own field of labor but to own the truth
i very soon became sensible that as regarded society at large we
stood in a position of new hostility rather than new brotherhood nor
could this fail to be the case in some degree until the bigger and
better half of society should range itself on our side constituting so
pitiful a minority as now we were inevitably estranged from the rest
of mankind in pretty fair proportion with the strictness of our mutual
bond among ourselves

this dawning idea however was driven back into my inner consciousness
by the entrance of zenobia she came with the welcome intelligence
that supper was on the table looking at herself in the glass and
perceiving that her one magnificent flower had grown rather languid
probably by being exposed to the fervency of the kitchen fire she
flung it on the floor as unconcernedly as a village girl would throw
away a faded violet the action seemed proper to her character
although methought it would still more have befitted the bounteous
nature of this beautiful woman to scatter fresh flowers from her hand
and to revive faded ones by her touch nevertheless it was a singular
but irresistible effect the presence of zenobia caused our heroic
enterprise to show like an illusion a masquerade a pastoral a
counterfeit arcadia in which we grown-up men and women were making a
play-day of the years that were given us to live in i tried to
analyze this impression but not with much success

it really vexes me observed zenobia as we left the room that mr
hollingsworth should be such a laggard i should not have thought him
at all the sort of person to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind
or a few snowflakes drifting into his face

do you know hollingsworth personally i inquired

no only as an auditor auditress i mean of some of his lectures
said she what a voice he has and what a man he is yet not so much
an intellectual man i should say as a great heart at least he moved
me more deeply than i think myself capable of being moved except by
the stroke of a true strong heart against my own it is a sad pity
that he should have devoted his glorious powers to such a grimy
unbeautiful and positively hopeless object as this reformation of
criminals about which he makes himself and his wretchedly small
audiences so very miserable to tell you a secret i never could
tolerate a philanthropist before could you

by no means i answered neither can i now

they are indeed an odiously disagreeable set of mortals continued
zenobia i should like mr hollingsworth a great deal better if the
philanthropy had been left out at all events as a mere matter of
taste i wish he would let the bad people alone and try to benefit
those who are not already past his help do you suppose he will be
content to spend his life or even a few months of it among tolerably
virtuous and comfortable individuals like ourselves

upon my word i doubt it said i if we wish to keep him with us we
must systematically commit at least one crime apiece mere peccadillos
will not satisfy him

zenobia turned sidelong a strange kind of a glance upon me but
before i could make out what it meant we had entered the kitchen
where in accordance with the rustic simplicity of our new life the
supper-table was spread



iv the supper-table

the pleasant firelight i must still keep harping on it the kitchen
hearth had an old-fashioned breadth depth and spaciousness far
within which lay what seemed the butt of a good-sized oak-tree with
the moisture bubbling merrily out at both ends it was now half an
hour beyond dusk the blaze from an armful of substantial sticks
rendered more combustible by brushwood and pine flickered powerfully
on the smoke-blackened walls and so cheered our spirits that we cared
not what inclemency might rage and roar on the other side of our
illuminated windows a yet sultrier warmth was bestowed by a goodly
quantity of peat which was crumbling to white ashes among the burning
brands and incensed the kitchen with its not ungrateful fragrance
the exuberance of this household fire would alone have sufficed to
bespeak us no true farmers for the new england yeoman if he have the
misfortune to dwell within practicable distance of a wood-market is as
niggardly of each stick as if it were a bar of california gold

but it was fortunate for us on that wintry eve of our untried life to
enjoy the warm and radiant luxury of a somewhat too abundant fire if
it served no other purpose it made the men look so full of youth warm
blood and hope and the women such of them at least as were anywise
convertible by its magic so very beautiful that i would cheerfully
have spent my last dollar to prolong the blaze as for zenobia there
was a glow in her cheeks that made me think of pandora fresh from
vulcan's workshop and full of the celestial warmth by dint of which he
had tempered and moulded her

take your places my dear friends all cried she seat yourselves
without ceremony and you shall be made happy with such tea as not many
of the world's working-people except yourselves will find in their
cups to-night after this one supper you may drink buttermilk if you
please to-night we will quaff this nectar which i assure you could
not be bought with gold

we all sat down grizzly silas foster his rotund helpmate and the
two bouncing handmaidens included and looked at one another in a
friendly but rather awkward way it was the first practical trial of
our theories of equal brotherhood and sisterhood and we people of
superior cultivation and refinement for as such i presume we
unhesitatingly reckoned ourselves felt as if something were already
accomplished towards the millennium of love the truth is however
that the laboring oar was with our unpolished companions it being far
easier to condescend than to accept of condescension neither did i
refrain from questioning in secret whether some of us and zenobia
among the rest would so quietly have taken our places among these good
people save for the cherished consciousness that it was not by
necessity but choice though we saw fit to drink our tea out of
earthen cups to-night and in earthen company it was at our own option
to use pictured porcelain and handle silver forks again to-morrow
this same salvo as to the power of regaining our former position
contributed much i fear to the equanimity with which we subsequently
bore many of the hardships and humiliations of a life of toil if ever
i have deserved which has not often been the case and i think
never but if ever i did deserve to be soundly cuffed by a fellow
mortal for secretly putting weight upon some imaginary social
advantage it must have been while i was striving to prove myself
ostentatiously his equal and no more it was while i sat beside him on
his cobbler's bench or clinked my hoe against his own in the
cornfield or broke the same crust of bread my earth-grimed hand to
his at our noontide lunch the poor proud man should look at both
sides of sympathy like this

the silence which followed upon our sitting down to table grew rather
oppressive indeed it was hardly broken by a word during the first
round of zenobia's fragrant tea

i hope said i at last that our blazing windows will be visible a
great way off there is nothing so pleasant and encouraging to a
solitary traveller on a stormy night as a flood of firelight seen
amid the gloom these ruddy window panes cannot fail to cheer the
hearts of all that look at them are they not warm with the
beacon-fire which we have kindled for humanity

the blaze of that brushwood will only last a minute or two longer
observed silas foster but whether he meant to insinuate that our moral
illumination would have as brief a term i cannot say

meantime said zenobia it may serve to guide some wayfarer to a
shelter

and just as she said this there came a knock at the house door

there is one of the world's wayfarers said i ay ay just so
quoth silas foster our firelight will draw stragglers just as a
candle draws dorbugs on a summer night

whether to enjoy a dramatic suspense or that we were selfishly
contrasting our own comfort with the chill and dreary situation of the
unknown person at the threshold or that some of us city folk felt a
little startled at the knock which came so unseasonably through night
and storm to the door of the lonely farmhouse so it happened that
nobody for an instant or two arose to answer the summons pretty
soon there came another knock the first had been moderately loud the
second was smitten so forcibly that the knuckles of the applicant must
have left their mark in the door panel

he knocks as if he had a right to come in said zenobia laughing
and what are we thinking of it must be mr hollingsworth

hereupon i went to the door unbolted and flung it wide open there
sure enough stood hollingsworth his shaggy greatcoat all covered with
snow so that he looked quite as much like a polar bear as a modern
philanthropist

sluggish hospitality this said he in those deep tones of his which
seemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel it would have
served you right if i had lain down and spent the night on the
doorstep just for the sake of putting you to shame but here is a
guest who will need a warmer and softer bed

and stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither
hollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorstep a
figure enveloped in a cloak it was evidently a woman or
rather judging from the ease with which he lifted her and the little
space which she seemed to fill in his arms a slim and unsubstantial
girl as she showed some hesitation about entering the door
hollingsworth with his usual directness and lack of ceremony urged
her forward not merely within the entry but into the warm and strongly
lighted kitchen

who is this whispered i remaining behind with him while he was
taking off his greatcoat

who really i don't know answered hollingsworth looking at me
with some surprise it is a young person who belongs here however
and no doubt she had been expected zenobia or some of the women
folks can tell you all about it

i think not said i glancing towards the new-comer and the other
occupants of the kitchen nobody seems to welcome her i should
hardly judge that she was an expected guest

well well said hollingsworth quietly we'll make it right

the stranger or whatever she were remained standing precisely on that
spot of the kitchen floor to which hollingsworth's kindly hand had
impelled her the cloak falling partly off she was seen to be a very
young woman dressed in a poor but decent gown made high in the neck
and without any regard to fashion or smartness her brown hair fell
down from beneath a hood not in curls but with only a slight wave her
face was of a wan almost sickly hue betokening habitual seclusion
from the sun and free atmosphere like a flower-shrub that had done its
best to blossom in too scanty light to complete the pitiableness of
her aspect she shivered either with cold or fear or nervous
excitement so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the
fire-lighted wall in short there has seldom been seen so depressed
and sad a figure as this young girl's and it was hardly possible to
help being angry with her from mere despair of doing anything for her
comfort the fantasy occurred to me that she was some desolate kind of
a creature doomed to wander about in snowstorms and that though the
ruddiness of our window panes had tempted her into a human dwelling
she would not remain long enough to melt the icicles out of her hair
another conjecture likewise came into my mind recollecting
hollingsworth's sphere of philanthropic action i deemed it possible
that he might have brought one of his guilty patients to be wrought
upon and restored to spiritual health by the pure influences which our
mode of life would create

as yet the girl had not stirred she stood near the door fixing a
pair of large brown melancholy eyes upon zenobia only upon
zenobia she evidently saw nothing else in the room save that bright
fair rosy beautiful woman it was the strangest look i ever
witnessed long a mystery to me and forever a memory once she seemed
about to move forward and greet her i know not with what warmth or
with what words but finally instead of doing so she dropped down
upon her knees clasped her hands and gazed piteously into zenobia's
face meeting no kindly reception her head fell on her bosom

i never thoroughly forgave zenobia for her conduct on this occasion
but women are always more cautious in their casual hospitalities than
men

what does the girl mean cried she in rather a sharp tone is she
crazy has she no tongue

and here hollingsworth stepped forward

no wonder if the poor child's tongue is frozen in her mouth said he
and i think he positively frowned at zenobia the very heart will be
frozen in her bosom unless you women can warm it among you with the
warmth that ought to be in your own

hollingsworth's appearance was very striking at this moment he was
then about thirty years old but looked several years older with his
great shaggy head his heavy brow his dark complexion his abundant
beard and the rude strength with which his features seemed to have
been hammered out of iron rather than chiselled or moulded from any
finer or softer material his figure was not tall but massive and
brawny and well befitting his original occupation which as the reader
probably knows was that of a blacksmith as for external polish or
mere courtesy of manner he never possessed more than a tolerably
educated bear although in his gentler moods there was a tenderness
in his voice eyes mouth in his gesture and in every indescribable
manifestation which few men could resist and no woman but he now
looked stern and reproachful and it was with that inauspicious meaning
in his glance that hollingsworth first met zenobia's eyes and began
his influence upon her life

to my surprise zenobia of whose haughty spirit i had been told so
many examples absolutely changed color and seemed mortified and
confused

you do not quite do me justice mr hollingsworth said she almost
humbly i am willing to be kind to the poor girl is she a protegee
of yours what can i do for her

have you anything to ask of this lady said hollingsworth kindly to
the girl i remember you mentioned her name before we left town

only that she will shelter me replied the girl tremulously only
that she will let me be always near her

well indeed exclaimed zenobia recovering herself and laughing
this is an adventure and well-worthy to be the first incident in our
life of love and free-heartedness but i accept it for the present
without further question only added she it would be a convenience
if we knew your name

priscilla said the girl and it appeared to me that she hesitated
whether to add anything more and decided in the negative pray do
not ask me my other name at least not yet if you will be so kind to
a forlorn creature

priscilla priscilla i repeated the name to myself three or four
times and in that little space this quaint and prim cognomen had so
amalgamated itself with my idea of the girl that it seemed as if no
other name could have adhered to her for a moment heretofore the poor
thing had not shed any tears but now that she found herself received
and at least temporarily established the big drops began to ooze out
from beneath her eyelids as if she were full of them perhaps it showed
the iron substance of my heart that i could not help smiling at this
odd scene of unknown and unaccountable calamity into which our
cheerful party had been entrapped without the liberty of choosing
whether to sympathize or no hollingsworth's behavior was certainly a
great deal more creditable than mine

let us not pry further into her secrets he said to zenobia and the
rest of us apart and his dark shaggy face looked really beautiful
with its expression of thoughtful benevolence let us conclude that
providence has sent her to us as the first-fruits of the world which
we have undertaken to make happier than we find it let us warm her
poor shivering body with this good fire and her poor shivering heart
with our best kindness let us feed her and make her one of us as
we do by this friendless girl so shall we prosper and in good time
whatever is desirable for us to know will be melted out of her as
inevitably as those tears which we see now

at least remarked i you may tell us how and where you met with
her

an old man brought her to my lodgings answered hollingsworth and
begged me to convey her to blithedale where so i understood him she
had friends and this is positively all i know about the matter

grim silas foster all this while had been busy at the supper-table
pouring out his own tea and gulping it down with no more sense of its
exquisiteness than if it were a decoction of catnip helping himself to
pieces of dipt toast on the flat of his knife blade and dropping half
of it on the table-cloth using the same serviceable implement to cut
slice after slice of ham perpetrating terrible enormities with the
butter-plate and in all other respects behaving less like a civilized
christian than the worst kind of an ogre being by this time fully
gorged he crowned his amiable exploits with a draught from the water
pitcher and then favored us with his opinion about the business in
hand and certainly though they proceeded out of an unwiped mouth
his expressions did him honor

give the girl a hot cup of tea and a thick slice of this first-rate
bacon said silas like a sensible man as he was that's what she
wants let her stay with us as long as she likes and help in the
kitchen and take the cow-breath at milking time and in a week or
two she'll begin to look like a creature of this world

so we sat down again to supper and priscilla along with us



v until bedtime

silas foster by the time we concluded our meal had stript off his
coat and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire with a
lapstone a hammer a piece of sole leather and some waxed-ends in
order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots he being in his own
phrase something of a dab whatever degree of skill that may imply
at the shoemaking business we heard the tap of his hammer at
intervals for the rest of the evening the remainder of the party
adjourned to the sitting-room good mrs foster took her
knitting-work and soon fell fast asleep still keeping her needles in
brisk movement and to the best of my observation absolutely footing
a stocking out of the texture of a dream and a very substantial
stocking it seemed to be one of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel
and the other appeared to be making a ruffle for her sunday's wear
out of a little bit of embroidered muslin which zenobia had probably
given her

it was curious to observe how trustingly and yet how timidly our poor
priscilla betook herself into the shadow of zenobia's protection she
sat beside her on a stool looking up every now and then with an
expression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty a brilliant
woman is often an object of the devoted admiration it might almost be
termed worship or idolatry of some young girl who perhaps beholds
the cynosure only at an awful distance and has as little hope of
personal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven we men
are too gross to comprehend it even a woman of mature age despises
or laughs at such a passion there occurred to me no mode of
accounting for priscilla's behavior except by supposing that she had
read some of zenobia's stories as such literature goes everywhere or
her tracts in defence of the sex and had come hither with the one
purpose of being her slave there is nothing parallel to this i
believe nothing so foolishly disinterested and hardly anything so
beautiful in the masculine nature at whatever epoch of life or if
there be a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be
looked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such
self-forgetful affection

zenobia happening to change her seat i took the opportunity in an
undertone to suggest some such notion as the above

since you see the young woman in so poetical a light replied she in
the same tone you had better turn the affair into a ballad it is a
grand subject and worthy of supernatural machinery the storm the
startling knock at the door the entrance of the sable knight
hollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden who precisely at the
stroke of midnight shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold
water and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers and when the
verses are written and polished quite to your mind i will favor you
with my idea as to what the girl really is

pray let me have it now said i it shall be woven into the ballad

she is neither more nor less answered zenobia than a seamstress
from the city and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than
to do my miscellaneous sewing for i suppose she will hardly expect to
make my dresses

how can you decide upon her so easily i inquired

oh we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of
masculine perceptions said zenobia there is no proof which you
would be likely to appreciate except the needle marks on the tip of
her forefinger then my supposition perfectly accounts for her
paleness her nervousness and her wretched fragility poor thing she
has been stifled with the heat of a salamander stove in a small close
room and has drunk coffee and fed upon doughnuts raisins candy and
all such trash till she is scarcely half alive and so as she has
hardly any physique a poet like mr miles coverdale may be allowed to
think her spiritual

look at her now whispered i

priscilla was gazing towards us with an inexpressible sorrow in her wan
face and great tears running down her cheeks it was difficult to
resist the impression that cautiously as we had lowered our voices
she must have overheard and been wounded by zenobia's scornful estimate
of her character and purposes

what ears the girl must have whispered zenobia with a look of
vexation partly comic and partly real i will confess to you that i
cannot quite make her out however i am positively not an ill-natured
person unless when very grievously provoked and as you and
especially mr hollingsworth take so much interest in this odd
creature and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart
likewise why i mean to let her in from this moment i will be
reasonably kind to her there is no pleasure in tormenting a person of
one's own sex even if she do favor one with a little more love than
one can conveniently dispose of and that let me say mr coverdale
is the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman

thank you said i smiling i don't mean to be guilty of it

she went towards priscilla took her hand and passed her own rosy
finger-tips with a pretty caressing movement over the girl's hair
the touch had a magical effect so vivid a look of joy flushed up
beneath those fingers that it seemed as if the sad and wan priscilla
had been snatched away and another kind of creature substituted in her
place this one caress bestowed voluntarily by zenobia was evidently
received as a pledge of all that the stranger sought from her whatever
the unuttered boon might be from that instant too she melted in
quietly amongst us and was no longer a foreign element though always
an object of peculiar interest a riddle and a theme of frequent
discussion her tenure at blithedale was thenceforth fixed we no more
thought of questioning it than if priscilla had been recognized as a
domestic sprite who had haunted the rustic fireside of old before we
had ever been warmed by its blaze

she now produced out of a work-bag that she had with her some little
wooden instruments what they are called i never knew and proceeded
to knit or net an article which ultimately took the shape of a silk
purse as the work went on i remembered to have seen just such purses
before indeed i was the possessor of one their peculiar excellence
besides the great delicacy and beauty of the manufacture lay in the
almost impossibility that any uninitiated person should discover the
aperture although to a practised touch they would open as wide as
charity or prodigality might wish i wondered if it were not a symbol
of priscilla's own mystery

notwithstanding the new confidence with which zenobia had inspired her
our guest showed herself disquieted by the storm when the strong
puffs of wind spattered the snow against the windows and made the oaken
frame of the farmhouse creak she looked at us apprehensively as if to
inquire whether these tempestuous outbreaks did not betoken some
unusual mischief in the shrieking blast she had been bred up no
doubt in some close nook some inauspiciously sheltered court of the
city where the uttermost rage of a tempest though it might scatter
down the slates of the roof into the bricked area could not shake the
casement of her little room the sense of vast undefined space
pressing from the outside against the black panes of our uncurtained
windows was fearful to the poor girl heretofore accustomed to the
narrowness of human limits with the lamps of neighboring tenements
glimmering across the street the house probably seemed to her adrift
on the great ocean of the night a little parallelogram of sky was all
that she had hitherto known of nature so that she felt the awfulness
that really exists in its limitless extent once while the blast was
bellowing she caught hold of zenobia's robe with precisely the air of
one who hears her own name spoken at a distance but is unutterably
reluctant to obey the call

we spent rather an incommunicative evening hollingsworth hardly said
a word unless when repeatedly and pertinaciously addressed then
indeed he would glare upon us from the thick shrubbery of his
meditations like a tiger out of a jungle make the briefest reply
possible and betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and
mind the poor fellow had contracted this ungracious habit from the
intensity with which he contemplated his own ideas and the infrequent
sympathy which they met with from his auditors a circumstance that
seemed only to strengthen the implicit confidence that he awarded to
them his heart i imagine was never really interested in our
socialist scheme but was forever busy with his strange and as most
people thought it impracticable plan for the reformation of criminals
through an appeal to their higher instincts

much as i liked hollingsworth it cost me many a groan to tolerate him
on this point he ought to have commenced his investigation of the
subject by perpetrating some huge sin in his proper person and
examining the condition of his higher instincts afterwards

the rest of us formed ourselves into a committee for providing our
infant community with an appropriate name a matter of greatly more
difficulty than the uninitiated reader would suppose blithedale was
neither good nor bad we should have resumed the old indian name of
the premises had it possessed the oil-and-honey flow which the
aborigines were so often happy in communicating to their local
appellations but it chanced to be a harsh ill-connected and
interminable word which seemed to fill the mouth with a mixture of
very stiff clay and very crumbly pebbles zenobia suggested sunny
glimpse as expressive of a vista into a better system of society
this we turned over and over for a while acknowledging its prettiness
but concluded it to be rather too fine and sentimental a name a fault
inevitable by literary ladies in such attempts for sunburnt men to
work under i ventured to whisper utopia which however was
unanimously scouted down and the proposer very harshly maltreated as
if he had intended a latent satire some were for calling our
institution the oasis in view of its being the one green spot in the
moral sand-waste of the world but others insisted on a proviso for
reconsidering the matter at a twelvemonths end when a final decision
might be had whether to name it the oasis or sahara so at last
finding it impracticable to hammer out anything better we resolved
that the spot should still be blithedale as being of good augury
enough

the evening wore on and the outer solitude looked in upon us through
the windows gloomy wild and vague like another state of existence
close beside the little sphere of warmth and light in which we were the
prattlers and bustlers of a moment by and by the door was opened by
silas foster with a cotton handkerchief about his head and a tallow
candle in his hand

take my advice brother farmers said he with a great broad
bottomless yawn and get to bed as soon as you can i shall sound the
horn at daybreak and we've got the cattle to fodder and nine cows to
milk and a dozen other things to do before breakfast

thus ended the first evening at blithedale i went shivering to my
fireless chamber with the miserable consciousness which had been
growing upon me for several hours past that i had caught a tremendous
cold and should probably awaken at the blast of the horn a fit
subject for a hospital the night proved a feverish one during the
greater part of it i was in that vilest of states when a fixed idea
remains in the mind like the nail in sisera's brain while innumerable
other ideas go and come and flutter to and fro combining constant
transition with intolerable sameness had i made a record of that
night's half-waking dreams it is my belief that it would have
anticipated several of the chief incidents of this narrative including
a dim shadow of its catastrophe starting up in bed at length i saw
that the storm was past and the moon was shining on the snowy
landscape which looked like a lifeless copy of the world in marble

from the bank of the distant river which was shimmering in the
moonlight came the black shadow of the only cloud in heaven driven
swiftly by the wind and passing over meadow and hillock vanishing
amid tufts of leafless trees but reappearing on the hither side until
it swept across our doorstep

how cold an arcadia was this



vi coverdale's sick-chamber

the horn sounded at daybreak as silas foster had forewarned us harsh
uproarious inexorably drawn out and as sleep-dispelling as if this
hard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom

on all sides i could hear the creaking of the bedsteads as the
brethren of blithedale started from slumber and thrust themselves into
their habiliments all awry no doubt in their haste to begin the
reformation of the world zenobia put her head into the entry and
besought silas foster to cease his clamor and to be kind enough to
leave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door
of the whole household unless indeed it were priscilla for whose
habits in this particular i cannot vouch of all our apostolic
society whose mission was to bless mankind hollingsworth i
apprehend was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer my
sleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his the solemn murmur
of his voice made its way to my ears compelling me to be an auditor of
his awful privacy with the creator it affected me with a deep
reverence for hollingsworth which no familiarity then existing or
that afterwards grew more intimate between us no nor my subsequent
perception of his own great errors ever quite effaced it is so rare
in these times to meet with a man of prayerful habits except of
course in the pulpit that such an one is decidedly marked out by the
light of transfiguration shed upon him in the divine interview from
which he passes into his daily life

as for me i lay abed and if i said my prayers it was backward
cursing my day as bitterly as patient job himself the truth was the
hot-house warmth of a town residence and the luxurious life in which i
indulged myself had taken much of the pith out of my physical system
and the wintry blast of the preceding day together with the general
chill of our airy old farmhouse had got fairly into my heart and the
marrow of my bones in this predicament i seriously wished selfish
as it may appear that the reformation of society had been postponed
about half a century or at all events to such a date as should have
put my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question

what in the name of common-sense had i to do with any better society
than i had always lived in it had satisfied me well enough my
pleasant bachelor-parlor sunny and shadowy curtained and carpeted
with the bedchamber adjoining my centre-table strewn with books and
periodicals my writing-desk with a half-finished poem in a stanza of
my own contrivance my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture
gallery my noontide walk along the cheery pavement with the
suggestive succession of human faces and the brisk throb of human life
in which i shared my dinner at the albion where i had a hundred
dishes at command and could banquet as delicately as the wizard
michael scott when the devil fed him from the king of france's kitchen
my evening at the billiard club the concert the theatre or at
somebody's party if i pleased what could be better than all this
was it better to hoe to mow to toil and moil amidst the accumulations
of a barnyard to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen
cows to eat salt beef and earn it with the sweat of my brow and
thereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth into whose
vocation i had thrust myself above all was it better to have a fever
and die blaspheming as i was like to do

in this wretched plight with a furnace in my heart and another in my
head by the heat of which i was kept constantly at the boiling point
yet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into
the icy atmosphere of the room i kept my bed until breakfast-time
when hollingsworth knocked at the door and entered

well coverdale cried he you bid fair to make an admirable farmer
don't you mean to get up to-day

neither to-day nor to-morrow said i hopelessly i doubt if i ever
rise again

what is the matter now he asked

i told him my piteous case and besought him to send me back to town in
a close carriage

no no said hollingsworth with kindly seriousness if you are
really sick we must take care of you

accordingly he built a fire in my chamber and having little else to
do while the snow lay on the ground established himself as my nurse a
doctor was sent for who being homaeopathic gave me as much medicine
in the course of a fortnight's attendance as would have laid on the
point of a needle they fed me on water-gruel and i speedily became a
skeleton above ground but after all i have many precious
recollections connected with that fit of sickness

hollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible
comfort most men and certainly i could not always claim to be one of
the exceptions have a natural indifference if not an absolutely
hostile feeling towards those whom disease or weakness or calamity
of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our
selfish existence the education of christianity it is true the
sympathy of a like experience and the example of women may soften and
possibly subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex but it is
originally there and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our
brute brethren who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from
among them as an enemy it is for this reason that the stricken deer
goes apart and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den
except in love or the attachments of kindred or other very long and
habitual affection we really have no tenderness but there was
something of the woman moulded into the great stalwart frame of
hollingsworth nor was he ashamed of it as men often are of what is
best in them nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place
in his heart i knew it well however at that time although
afterwards it came nigh to be forgotten methought there could not be
two such men alive as hollingsworth there never was any blaze of a
fireside that warmed and cheered me in the down-sinkings and
shiverings of my spirit so effectually as did the light out of those
eyes which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows

happy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die
and unless a friend like hollingsworth be at hand as most probably
there will not he had better make up his mind to die alone how many
men i wonder does one meet with in a lifetime whom he would choose
for his deathbed companions at the crisis of my fever i besought
hollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room but continually to
make me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand a word a
prayer if he thought good to utter it and that then he should be the
witness how courageously i would encounter the worst it still
impresses me as almost a matter of regret that i did not die then when
i had tolerably made up my mind to it for hollingsworth would have
gone with me to the hither verge of life and have sent his friendly
and hopeful accents far over on the other side while i should be
treading the unknown path now were i to send for him he would
hardly come to my bedside nor should i depart the easier for his
presence

you are not going to die this time said he gravely smiling you
know nothing about sickness and think your case a great deal more
desperate than it is

death should take me while i am in the mood replied i with a little
of my customary levity

have you nothing to do in life asked hollingsworth that you fancy
yourself so ready to leave it

nothing answered i nothing that i know of unless to make pretty
verses and play a part with zenobia and the rest of the amateurs in
our pastoral it seems but an unsubstantial sort of business as
viewed through a mist of fever but dear hollingsworth your own
vocation is evidently to be a priest and to spend your days and nights
in helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths

and by which of my qualities inquired he can you suppose me fitted
for this awful ministry

by your tenderness i said it seems to me the reflection of god's
own love

and you call me tender repeated hollingsworth thoughtfully i
should rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an
inflexible severity of purpose mortal man has no right to be so
inflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be

i do not believe it i replied

but in due time i remembered what he said

probably as hollingsworth suggested my disorder was never so serious
as in my ignorance of such matters i was inclined to consider it
after so much tragical preparation it was positively rather mortifying
to find myself on the mending hand

all the other members of the community showed me kindness according to
the full measure of their capacity zenobia brought me my gruel every
day made by her own hands not very skilfully if the truth must be
told and whenever i seemed inclined to converse would sit by my
bedside and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous
throbs to my pulse her poor little stories and tracts never half did
justice to her intellect it was only the lack of a fitter avenue that
drove her to seek development in literature she was made among a
thousand other things that she might have been for a stump oratress
i recognized no severe culture in zenobia her mind was full of weeds
it startled me sometimes in my state of moral as well as bodily
faint-heartedness to observe the hardihood of her philosophy she
made no scruple of oversetting all human institutions and scattering
them as with a breeze from her fan a female reformer in her attacks
upon society has an instinctive sense of where the life lies and is
inclined to aim directly at that spot especially the relation between
the sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice

zenobia was truly a magnificent woman the homely simplicity of her
dress could not conceal nor scarcely diminish the queenliness of her
presence the image of her form and face should have been multiplied
all over the earth it was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her
as the spectacle of only a few the stage would have been her proper
sphere she should have made it a point of duty moreover to sit
endlessly to painters and sculptors and preferably to the latter
because the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost
scantiness of drapery so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with
her material perfection in its entireness i know not well how to
express that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks and even the
flesh-warmth over her round arms and what was visible of her full
bust in a word her womanliness incarnated compelled me sometimes
to close my eyes as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to
gaze at her illness and exhaustion no doubt had made me morbidly
sensitive

i noticed and wondered how zenobia contrived it that she had always a
new flower in her hair and still it was a hot-house flower an
outlandish flower a flower of the tropics such as appeared to have
sprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be
fervid and spicy unlike as was the flower of each successive day to
the preceding one it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich
beauty of the woman that i thought it the only flower fit to be worn
so fit indeed that nature had evidently created this floral gem in a
happy exuberance for the one purpose of worthily adorning zenobia's
head it might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves
about this peculiarity and caused it to look more gorgeous and
wonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes in the height of my
illness as i well recollect i went so far as to pronounce it
preternatural

zenobia is an enchantress whispered i once to hollingsworth she
is a sister of the veiled lady that flower in her hair is a talisman
if you were to snatch it away she would vanish or be transformed into
something else

what does he say asked zenobia

nothing that has an atom of sense in it answered hollingsworth he
is a little beside himself i believe and talks about your being a
witch and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your
hair

it is an idea worthy of a feverish poet said she laughing rather
compassionately and taking out the flower i scorn to owe anything
to magic here mr hollingsworth you may keep the spell while it has
any virtue in it but i cannot promise you not to appear with a new one
to-morrow it is the one relic of my more brilliant my happier days

the most curious part of the matter was that long after my slight
delirium had passed away as long indeed as i continued to know this
remarkable woman her daily flower affected my imagination though
more slightly yet in very much the same way the reason must have
been that whether intentionally on her part or not this favorite
ornament was actually a subtile expression of zenobia's character

one subject about which very impertinently moreover i perplexed
myself with a great many conjectures was whether zenobia had ever
been married the idea it must be understood was unauthorized by any
circumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears so young
as i beheld her and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand
there was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already
accomplished the probability was far greater that her coming years had
all life's richest gifts to bring if the great event of a woman's
existence had been consummated the world knew nothing of it although
the world seemed to know zenobia well it was a ridiculous piece of
romance undoubtedly to imagine that this beautiful personage wealthy
as she was and holding a position that might fairly enough be called
distinguished could have given herself away so privately but that
some whisper and suspicion and by degrees a full understanding of the
fact would eventually be blown abroad but then as i failed not to
consider her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles
rumors might fill the social atmosphere or might once have filled it
there which would travel but slowly against the wind towards our
northeastern metropolis and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching
it

there was not and i distinctly repeat it the slightest foundation in
my knowledge for any surmise of the kind but there is a species of
intuition either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a
fact which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system
the soul gets the better of the body after wasting illness or when a
vegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood vapors
then rise up to the brain and take shapes that often image falsehood
but sometimes truth the spheres of our companions have at such
periods a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust
health gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy zenobia's
sphere i imagine impressed itself powerfully on mine and transformed
me during this period of my weakness into something like a mesmerical
clairvoyant

then also as anybody could observe the freedom of her deportment
though to some tastes it might commend itself as the utmost
perfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron was not
exactly maiden-like what girl had ever laughed as zenobia did what
girl had ever spoken in her mellow tones her unconstrained and
inevitable manifestation i said often to myself was that of a woman
to whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery yet sometimes i
strove to be ashamed of these conjectures i acknowledged it as a
masculine grossness a sin of wicked interpretation of which man is
often guilty towards the other sex thus to mistake the sweet liberal
but womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition still it
was of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself
pertinaciously the thought zenobia is a wife zenobia has lived and
loved there is no folded petal no latent dewdrop in this perfectly
developed rose irresistibly that thought drove out all other
conclusions as often as my mind reverted to the subject

zenobia was conscious of my observation though not i presume of the
point to which it led me

mr coverdale said she one day as she saw me watching her while
she arranged my gruel on the table i have been exposed to a great
deal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world but never
i think to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring
me with i seem to interest you very much and yet or else a woman's
instinct is for once deceived i cannot reckon you as an admirer what
are you seeking to discover in me

the mystery of your life answered i surprised into the truth by the
unexpectedness of her attack and you will never tell me

she bent her head towards me and let me look into her eyes as if
challenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her
consciousness

i see nothing now said i closing my own eyes unless it be the
face of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well

a bachelor always feels himself defrauded when he knows or suspects
that any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away otherwise
the matter could have been no concern of mine it was purely
speculative for i should not under any circumstances have fallen in
love with zenobia the riddle made me so nervous however in my
sensitive condition of mind and body that i most ungratefully began to
wish that she would let me alone then too her gruel was very
wretched stuff with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it
like the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best
concocted dainties why could not she have allowed one of the other
women to take the gruel in charge whatever else might be her gifts
nature certainly never intended zenobia for a cook or if so she
should have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes and such
as are to be tasted at banquets between draughts of intoxicating wine



vii the convalescent

as soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences i
failed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom
hollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us it now
appeared that poor priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the
clouds as we were at first inclined to suppose a letter which
should have introduced her had since been received from one of the
city missionaries containing a certificate of character and an
allusion to circumstances which in the writer's judgment made it
especially desirable that she should find shelter in our community
there was a hint not very intelligible implying either that priscilla
had recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of
position or else that she was still liable to this danger or
difficulty whatever it might be we should ill have deserved the
reputation of a benevolent fraternity had we hesitated to entertain a
petitioner in such need and so strongly recommended to our kindness
not to mention moreover that the strange maiden had set herself
diligently to work and was doing good service with her needle but a
slight mist of uncertainty still floated about priscilla and kept her
as yet from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and
blood

the mysterious attraction which from her first entrance on our scene
she evinced for zenobia had lost nothing of its force i often heard
her footsteps soft and low accompanying the light but decided tread
of the latter up the staircase stealing along the passage-way by her
new friend's side and pausing while zenobia entered my chamber
occasionally zenobia would be a little annoyed by priscilla's too close
attendance in an authoritative and not very kindly tone she would
advise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk or to go with her
work into the barn holding out half a promise to come and sit on the
hay with her when at leisure evidently priscilla found but scanty
requital for her love hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with
her for several minutes together sometimes while my auditory nerves
retained the susceptibility of delicate health i used to hear a low
pleasant murmur ascending from the room below and at last ascertained
it to be priscilla's voice babbling like a little brook to
hollingsworth she talked more largely and freely with him than with
zenobia towards whom indeed her feelings seemed not so much to be
confidence as involuntary affection i should have thought all the
better of my own qualities had priscilla marked me out for the third
place in her regards but though she appeared to like me tolerably
well i could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as
hollingsworth and zenobia were

one forenoon during my convalescence there came a gentle tap at my
chamber door i immediately said come in priscilla with an acute
sense of the applicant's identity nor was i deceived it was really
priscilla a pale large-eyed little woman for she had gone far
enough into her teens to be at least on the outer limit of girlhood
but much less wan than at my previous view of her and far better
conditioned both as to health and spirits as i first saw her she had
reminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to
vegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court where there is scanty
soil and never any sunshine at present though with no approach to
bloom there were indications that the girl had human blood in her
veins

priscilla came softly to my bedside and held out an article of
snow-white linen very carefully and smoothly ironed she did not seem
bashful nor anywise embarrassed my weakly condition i suppose
supplied a medium in which she could approach me

do not you need this asked she i have made it for you it was a
nightcap

my dear priscilla said i smiling i never had on a nightcap in my
life but perhaps it will be better for me to wear one now that i am
a miserable invalid how admirably you have done it no no i never
can think of wearing such an exquisitely wrought nightcap as this
unless it be in the daytime when i sit up to receive company

it is for use not beauty answered priscilla i could have
embroidered it and made it much prettier if i pleased

while holding up the nightcap and admiring the fine needlework i
perceived that priscilla had a sealed letter which she was waiting for
me to take it had arrived from the village post-office that morning
as i did not immediately offer to receive the letter she drew it back
and held it against her bosom with both hands clasped over it in a
way that had probably grown habitual to her now on turning my eyes
from the nightcap to priscilla it forcibly struck me that her air
though not her figure and the expression of her face but not its
features had a resemblance to what i had often seen in a friend of
mine one of the most gifted women of the age i cannot describe it
the points easiest to convey to the reader were a certain curve of the
shoulders and a partial closing of the eyes which seemed to look more
penetratingly into my own eyes through the narrowed apertures than if
they had been open at full width it was a singular anomaly of
likeness coexisting with perfect dissimilitude

will you give me the letter priscilla said i

she started put the letter into my hand and quite lost the look that
had drawn my notice

priscilla i inquired did you ever see miss margaret fuller

no she answered

because said i you reminded me of her just now and it happens
strangely enough that this very letter is from her

priscilla for whatever reason looked very much discomposed

i wish people would not fancy such odd things in me she said rather
petulantly how could i possibly make myself resemble this lady
merely by holding her letter in my hand

certainly priscilla it would puzzle me to explain it i replied
nor do i suppose that the letter had anything to do with it it was
just a coincidence nothing more

she hastened out of the room and this was the last that i saw of
priscilla until i ceased to be an invalid

being much alone during my recovery i read interminably in mr
emerson's essays the dial carlyle's works george sand's romances
lent me by zenobia and other books which one or another of the
brethren or sisterhood had brought with them agreeing in little else
most of these utterances were like the cry of some solitary sentinel
whose station was on the outposts of the advance guard of human
progression or sometimes the voice came sadly from among the shattered
ruins of the past but yet had a hopeful echo in the future they were
well adapted better at least than any other intellectual products
the volatile essence of which had heretofore tinctured a printed page
to pilgrims like ourselves whose present bivouac was considerably
further into the waste of chaos than any mortal army of crusaders had
ever marched before fourier's works also in a series of horribly
tedious volumes attracted a good deal of my attention from the
analogy which i could not but recognize between his system and our own
there was far less resemblance it is true than the world chose to
imagine inasmuch as the two theories differed as widely as the zenith
from the nadir in their main principles

i talked about fourier to hollingsworth and translated for his
benefit some of the passages that chiefly impressed me

when as a consequence of human improvement said i the globe shall
arrive at its final perfection the great ocean is to be converted into
a particular kind of lemonade such as was fashionable at paris in
fourier's time he calls it limonade a cedre it is positively a
fact just imagine the city docks filled every day with a flood tide
of this delectable beverage

why did not the frenchman make punch of it at once asked
hollingsworth the jack-tars would be delighted to go down in ships
and do business in such an element

i further proceeded to explain as well as i modestly could several
points of fourier's system illustrating them with here and there a
page or two and asking hollingsworth's opinion as to the expediency of
introducing these beautiful peculiarities into our own practice

let me hear no more of it cried he in utter disgust i never will
forgive this fellow he has committed the unpardonable sin for what
more monstrous iniquity could the devil himself contrive than to choose
the selfish principle the principle of all human wrong the very
blackness of man's heart the portion of ourselves which we shudder at
and which it is the whole aim of spiritual discipline to eradicate to
choose it as the master workman of his system to seize upon and
foster whatever vile petty sordid filthy bestial and abominable
corruptions have cankered into our nature to be the efficient
instruments of his infernal regeneration and his consummated
paradise as he pictures it would be worthy of the agency which he
counts upon for establishing it the nauseous villain

nevertheless remarked i in consideration of the promised delights
of his system so very proper as they certainly are to be
appreciated by fourier's countrymen i cannot but wonder that
universal france did not adopt his theory at a moment's warning but
is there not something very characteristic of his nation in fourier's
manner of putting forth his views he makes no claim to inspiration
he has not persuaded himself as swedenborg did and as any other than
a frenchman would with a mission of like importance to
communicate that he speaks with authority from above he promulgates
his system so far as i can perceive entirely on his own
responsibility he has searched out and discovered the whole counsel
of the almighty in respect to mankind past present and for exactly
seventy thousand years to come by the mere force and cunning of his
individual intellect

take the book out of my sight said hollingsworth with great
virulence of expression or i tell you fairly i shall fling it in
the fire and as for fourier let him make a paradise if he can of
gehenna where as i conscientiously believe he is floundering at this
moment

and bellowing i suppose said i not that i felt any ill-will
towards fourier but merely wanted to give the finishing touch to
hollingsworth's image bellowing for the least drop of his beloved
limonade a cedre

there is but little profit to be expected in attempting to argue with a
man who allows himself to declaim in this manner so i dropt the
subject and never took it up again

but had the system at which he was so enraged combined almost any
amount of human wisdom spiritual insight and imaginative beauty i
question whether hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive
it i began to discern that he had come among us actuated by no real
sympathy with our feelings and our hopes but chiefly because we were
estranging ourselves from the world with which his lonely and
exclusive object in life had already put him at odds hollingsworth
must have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence
deep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested
good as providence often allows a human being the privilege of
conferring upon his fellows this native instinct yet lived within
him i myself had profited by it in my necessity it was seen too
in his treatment of priscilla such casual circumstances as were here
involved would quicken his divine power of sympathy and make him seem
while their influence lasted the tenderest man and the truest friend
on earth but by and by you missed the tenderness of yesterday and
grew drearily conscious that hollingsworth had a closer friend than
ever you could be and this friend was the cold spectral monster which
he had himself conjured up and on which he was wasting all the warmth
of his heart and of which at last as these men of a mighty purpose
so invariably do he had grown to be the bond-slave it was his
philanthropic theory

this was a result exceedingly sad to contemplate considering that it
had been mainly brought about by the very ardor and exuberance of his
philanthropy sad indeed but by no means unusual he had taught his
benevolence to pour its warm tide exclusively through one channel so
that there was nothing to spare for other great manifestations of love
to man nor scarcely for the nutriment of individual attachments
unless they could minister in some way to the terrible egotism which he
mistook for an angel of god had hollingsworth's education been more
enlarged he might not so inevitably have stumbled into this pitfall
but this identical pursuit had educated him he knew absolutely
nothing except in a single direction where he had thought so
energetically and felt to such a depth that no doubt the entire
reason and justice of the universe appeared to be concentrated
thitherward

it is my private opinion that at this period of his life
hollingsworth was fast going mad and as with other crazy people
among whom i include humorists of every degree it required all the
constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him
an intolerable bore such prolonged fiddling upon one string such
multiform presentation of one idea his specific object of which he
made the public more than sufficiently aware through the medium of
lectures and pamphlets was to obtain funds for the construction of an
edifice with a sort of collegiate endowment on this foundation he
purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental
culture of our criminal brethren his visionary edifice was
hollingsworth's one castle in the air it was the material type in
which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself and he made the
scheme more definite and caught hold of it the more strongly and kept
his clutch the more pertinaciously by rendering it visible to the
bodily eye i have seen him a hundred times with a pencil and sheet
of paper sketching the facade the side-view or the rear of the
structure or planning the internal arrangements as lovingly as
another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be
happy with his wife and children i have known him to begin a model of
the building with little stones gathered at the brookside whither we
had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time unlike
all other ghosts his spirit haunted an edifice which instead of
being time-worn and full of storied love and joy and sorrow had
never yet come into existence

dear friend said i once to hollingsworth before leaving my
sick-chamber i heartily wish that i could make your schemes my
schemes because it would be so great a happiness to find myself
treading the same path with you but i am afraid there is not stuff in
me stern enough for a philanthropist or not in this peculiar
direction or at all events not solely in this can you bear with
me if such should prove to be the case

i will at least wait awhile answered hollingsworth gazing at me
sternly and gloomily but how can you be my life-long friend except
you strive with me towards the great object of my life

heaven forgive me a horrible suspicion crept into my heart and stung
the very core of it as with the fangs of an adder i wondered whether
it were possible that hollingsworth could have watched by my bedside
with all that devoted care only for the ulterior purpose of making me
a proselyte to his views



viii a modern arcadia

may-day i forget whether by zenobia's sole decree or by the unanimous
vote of our community had been declared a movable festival it was
deferred until the sun should have had a reasonable time to clear away
the snowdrifts along the lee of the stone walls and bring out a few of
the readiest wild flowers on the forenoon of the substituted day
after admitting some of the balmy air into my chamber i decided that
it was nonsense and effeminacy to keep myself a prisoner any longer
so i descended to the sitting-room and finding nobody there proceeded
to the barn whence i had already heard zenobia's voice and along with
it a girlish laugh which was not so certainly recognizable arriving
at the spot it a little surprised me to discover that these merry
outbreaks came from priscilla

the two had been a-maying together they had found anemones in
abundance houstonias by the handful some columbines a few
long-stalked violets and a quantity of white everlasting flowers and
had filled up their basket with the delicate spray of shrubs and trees
none were prettier than the maple twigs the leaf of which looks like a
scarlet bud in may and like a plate of vegetable gold in october
zenobia who showed no conscience in such matters had also rifled a
cherry-tree of one of its blossomed boughs and with all this variety
of sylvan ornament had been decking out priscilla being done with a
good deal of taste it made her look more charming than i should have
thought possible with my recollection of the wan frost-nipt girl as
heretofore described nevertheless among those fragrant blossoms and
conspicuously too had been stuck a weed of evil odor and ugly aspect
which as soon as i detected it destroyed the effect of all the rest
there was a gleam of latent mischief not to call it deviltry in
zenobia's eye which seemed to indicate a slightly malicious purpose in
the arrangement

as for herself she scorned the rural buds and leaflets and wore
nothing but her invariable flower of the tropics

what do you think of priscilla now mr coverdale asked she
surveying her as a child does its doll is not she worth a verse or
two

there is only one thing amiss answered i zenobia laughed and flung
the malignant weed away

yes she deserves some verses now said i and from a better poet
than myself she is the very picture of the new england spring
subdued in tint and rather cool but with a capacity of sunshine and
bringing us a few alpine blossoms as earnest of something richer
though hardly more beautiful hereafter the best type of her is one
of those anemones

what i find most singular in priscilla as her health improves
observed zenobia is her wildness such a quiet little body as she
seemed one would not have expected that why as we strolled the
woods together i could hardly keep her from scrambling up the trees
like a squirrel she has never before known what it is to live in the
free air and so it intoxicates her as if she were sipping wine and
she thinks it such a paradise here and all of us particularly mr
hollingsworth and myself such angels it is quite ridiculous and
provokes one's malice almost to see a creature so happy especially a
feminine creature

they are always happier than male creatures said i

you must correct that opinion mr coverdale replied zenobia
contemptuously or i shall think you lack the poetic insight did you
ever see a happy woman in your life of course i do not mean a girl
like priscilla and a thousand others for they are all alike while on
the sunny side of experience but a grown woman how can she be
happy after discovering that fate has assigned her but one single
event which she must contrive to make the substance of her whole life
a man has his choice of innumerable events

a woman i suppose answered i by constant repetition of her one
event may compensate for the lack of variety

indeed said zenobia

while we were talking priscilla caught sight of hollingsworth at a
distance in a blue frock and with a hoe over his shoulder returning
from the field she immediately set out to meet him running and
skipping with spirits as light as the breeze of the may morning but
with limbs too little exercised to be quite responsive she clapped her
hands too with great exuberance of gesture as is the custom of young
girls when their electricity overcharges them but all at once midway
to hollingsworth she paused looked round about her towards the
river the road the woods and back towards us appearing to listen
as if she heard some one calling her name and knew not precisely in
what direction

have you bewitched her i exclaimed

it is no sorcery of mine said zenobia but i have seen the girl do
that identical thing once or twice before can you imagine what is the
matter with her

no unless said i she has the gift of hearing those airy tongues
that syllable men's names which milton tells about

from whatever cause priscilla's animation seemed entirely to have
deserted her she seated herself on a rock and remained there until
hollingsworth came up and when he took her hand and led her back to
us she rather resembled my original image of the wan and spiritless
priscilla than the flowery may-queen of a few moments ago these
sudden transformations only to be accounted for by an extreme nervous
susceptibility always continued to characterize the girl though with
diminished frequency as her health progressively grew more robust

i was now on my legs again my fit of illness had been an avenue
between two existences the low-arched and darksome doorway through
which i crept out of a life of old conventionalisms on my hands and
knees as it were and gained admittance into the freer region that lay
beyond in this respect it was like death and as with death too
it was good to have gone through it no otherwise could i have rid
myself of a thousand follies fripperies prejudices habits and other
such worldly dust as inevitably settles upon the crowd along the broad
highway giving them all one sordid aspect before noon-time however
freshly they may have begun their pilgrimage in the dewy morning the
very substance upon my bones had not been fit to live with in any
better truer or more energetic mode than that to which i was
accustomed so it was taken off me and flung aside like any other
worn-out or unseasonable garment and after shivering a little while
in my skeleton i began to be clothed anew and much more
satisfactorily than in my previous suit in literal and physical
truth i was quite another man i had a lively sense of the exultation
with which the spirit will enter on the next stage of its eternal
progress after leaving the heavy burden of its mortality in an early
grave with as little concern for what may become of it as now affected
me for the flesh which i had lost

emerging into the genial sunshine i half fancied that the labors of
the brotherhood had already realized some of fourier's predictions
their enlightened culture of the soil and the virtues with which they
sanctified their life had begun to produce an effect upon the material
world and its climate in my new enthusiasm man looked strong and
stately and woman oh how beautiful and the earth a green garden
blossoming with many-colored delights thus nature whose laws i had
broken in various artificial ways comported herself towards me as a
strict but loving mother who uses the rod upon her little boy for his
naughtiness and then gives him a smile a kiss and some pretty
playthings to console the urchin for her severity

in the interval of my seclusion there had been a number of recruits to
our little army of saints and martyrs they were mostly individuals
who had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with
ordinary pursuits but who were not yet so old nor had suffered so
deeply as to lose their faith in the better time to come on comparing
their minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a
community had been growing up in silent and unknown sympathy for
years thoughtful strongly lined faces were among them sombre brows
but eyes that did not require spectacles unless prematurely dimmed by
the student's lamplight and hair that seldom showed a thread of
silver age wedded to the past incrusted over with a stony layer of
habits and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities would have
been absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this youth too in
its early dawn was hardly more adapted to our purpose for it would
behold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very
same spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen
it vanish we had very young people with us it is true downy lads
rosy girls in their first teens and children of all heights above
one's knee but these had chiefly been sent hither for education which
it was one of the objects and methods of our institution to supply
then we had boarders from town and elsewhere who lived with us in a
familiar way sympathized more or less in our theories and sometimes
shared in our labors

on the whole it was a society such as has seldom met together nor
perhaps could it reasonably be expected to hold together long persons
of marked individuality crooked sticks as some of us might be
called are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot but so
long as our union should subsist a man of intellect and feeling with
a free nature in him might have sought far and near without finding so
many points of attraction as would allure him hitherward we were of
all creeds and opinions and generally tolerant of all on every
imaginable subject our bond it seems to me was not affirmative but
negative we had individually found one thing or another to quarrel
with in our past life and were pretty well agreed as to the
inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further as to
what should be substituted there was much less unanimity we did not
greatly care at least i never did for the written constitution under
which our millennium had commenced my hope was that between theory
and practice a true and available mode of life might be struck out
and that even should we ultimately fail the months or years spent in
the trial would not have been wasted either as regarded passing
enjoyment or the experience which makes men wise

arcadians though we were our costume bore no resemblance to the
beribboned doublets silk breeches and stockings and slippers fastened
with artificial roses that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry
and the stage in outward show i humbly conceive we looked rather
like a gang of beggars or banditti than either a company of honest
laboring-men or a conclave of philosophers whatever might be our
points of difference we all of us seemed to have come to blithedale
with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing out our old clothes
such garments as had an airing whenever we strode afield coats with
high collars and with no collars broad-skirted or swallow-tailed and
with the waist at every point between the hip and arm-pit pantaloons
of a dozen successive epochs and greatly defaced at the knees by the
humiliations of the wearer before his lady-love in short we were a
living epitome of defunct fashions and the very raggedest presentment
of men who had seen better days it was gentility in tatters often
retaining a scholarlike or clerical air you might have taken us for
the denizens of grub street intent on getting a comfortable livelihood
by agricultural labor or coleridge's projected pantisocracy in full
experiment or candide and his motley associates at work in their
cabbage garden or anything else that was miserably out at elbows and
most clumsily patched in the rear we might have been sworn comrades
to falstaff's ragged regiment little skill as we boasted in other
points of husbandry every mother's son of us would have served
admirably to stick up for a scarecrow and the worst of the matter
was that the first energetic movement essential to one downright
stroke of real labor was sure to put a finish to these poor
habiliments so we gradually flung them all aside and took to honest
homespun and linsey-woolsey as preferable on the whole to the plan
recommended i think by virgil ara nudus sere nudus  which as
silas foster remarked when i translated the maxim would be apt to
astonish the women-folks

after a reasonable training the yeoman life throve well with us our
faces took the sunburn kindly our chests gained in compass and our
shoulders in breadth and squareness our great brown fists looked as if
they had never been capable of kid gloves the plough the hoe the
scythe and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp the oxen
responded to our voices we could do almost as fair a day's work as
silas foster himself sleep dreamlessly after it and awake at daybreak
with only a little stiffness of the joints which was usually quite
gone by breakfast-time

to be sure our next neighbors pretended to be incredulous as to our
real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand they told
slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our own oxen or to drive
them afield when yoked or to release the poor brutes from their
conjugal bond at nightfall they had the face to say too that the
cows laughed at our awkwardness at milking-time and invariably kicked
over the pails partly in consequence of our putting the stool on the
wrong side and partly because taking offence at the whisking of their
tails we were in the habit of holding these natural fly-flappers with
one hand and milking with the other they further averred that we hoed
up whole acres of indian corn and other crops and drew the earth
carefully about the weeds and that we raised five hundred tufts of
burdock mistaking them for cabbages and that by dint of unskilful
planting few of our seeds ever came up at all or if they did come up
it was stern-foremost and that we spent the better part of the month
of june in reversing a field of beans which had thrust themselves out
of the ground in this unseemly way they quoted it as nothing more
than an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or
three fingers of a morning by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter
finally and as an ultimate catastrophe these mendacious rogues
circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated to the
last man by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own
scythes and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident

but this was pure envy and malice on the part of the neighboring
farmers the peril of our new way of life was not lest we should fail
in becoming practical agriculturists but that we should probably cease
to be anything else while our enterprise lay all in theory we had
pleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualization of
labor it was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship
each stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom
heretofore hidden from the sun pausing in the field to let the wind
exhale the moisture from our foreheads we were to look upward and
catch glimpses into the far-off soul of truth in this point of view
matters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated it is very
true that sometimes gazing casually around me out of the midst of my
toil i used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene
of earth and sky there was at such moments a novelty an unwonted
aspect on the face of nature as if she had been taken by surprise and
seen at unawares with no opportunity to put off her real look and
assume the mask with which she mysteriously hides herself from mortals
but this was all the clods of earth which we so constantly belabored
and turned over and over were never etherealized into thought our
thoughts on the contrary were fast becoming cloddish our labor
symbolized nothing and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the
evening intellectual activity is incompatible with any large amount of
bodily exercise the yeoman and the scholar the yeoman and the man of
finest moral culture though not the man of sturdiest sense and
integrity are two distinct individuals and can never be melted or
welded into one substance

zenobia soon saw this truth and gibed me about it one evening as
hollingsworth and i lay on the grass after a hard day's work

i am afraid you did not make a song today while loading the
hay-cart said she as burns did when he was reaping barley

burns never made a song in haying-time i answered very positively
he was no poet while a farmer and no farmer while a poet

and on the whole which of the two characters do you like best asked
zenobia for i have an idea that you cannot combine them any better
than burns did ah i see in my mind's eye what sort of an
individual you are to be two or three years hence grim silas foster
is your prototype with his palm of sole-leather and his joints of
rusty iron which all through summer keep the stiffness of what he
calls his winter's rheumatize and his brain of i don't know what his
brain is made of unless it be a savoy cabbage but yours may be
cauliflower as a rather more delicate variety your physical man will
be transmuted into salt beef and fried pork at the rate i should
imagine of a pound and a half a day that being about the average
which we find necessary in the kitchen you will make your toilet for
the day still like this delightful silas foster by rinsing your
fingers and the front part of your face in a little tin pan of water at
the doorstep and teasing your hair with a wooden pocket-comb before a
seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass your only pastime will be to smoke
some very vile tobacco in the black stump of a pipe

pray spare me cried i but the pipe is not silas's only mode of
solacing himself with the weed

your literature continued zenobia apparently delighted with her
description will be the farmer's almanac for i observe our friend
foster never gets so far as the newspaper when you happen to sit
down at odd moments you will fall asleep and make nasal proclamation
of the fact as he does and invariably you must be jogged out of a
nap after supper by the future mrs coverdale and persuaded to go
regularly to bed and on sundays when you put on a blue coat with
brass buttons you will think of nothing else to do but to go and
lounge over the stone walls and rail fences and stare at the corn
growing and you will look with a knowing eye at oxen and will have a
tendency to clamber over into pigsties and feel of the hogs and give
a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed
them already i have noticed you begin to speak through your nose and
with a drawl pray if you really did make any poetry to-day let us
hear it in that kind of utterance

coverdale has given up making verses now said hollingsworth who
never had the slightest appreciation of my poetry just think of him
penning a sonnet with a fist like that there is at least this good in
a life of toil that it takes the nonsense and fancy-work out of a man
and leaves nothing but what truly belongs to him if a farmer can make
poetry at the plough-tail it must be because his nature insists on it
and if that be the case let him make it in heaven's name

and how is it with you asked zenobia in a different voice for she
never laughed at hollingsworth as she often did at me you i think
cannot have ceased to live a life of thought and feeling

i have always been in earnest answered hollingsworth i have
hammered thought out of iron after heating the iron in my heart it
matters little what my outward toil may be were i a slave at the
bottom of a mine i should keep the same purpose the same faith in its
ultimate accomplishment that i do now miles coverdale is not in
earnest either as a poet or a laborer

you give me hard measure hollingsworth said i a little hurt i
have kept pace with you in the field and my bones feel as if i had
been in earnest whatever may be the case with my brain

i cannot conceive observed zenobia with great emphasis and no
doubt she spoke fairly the feeling of the moment i cannot conceive
of being so continually as mr coverdale is within the sphere of a
strong and noble nature without being strengthened and ennobled by its
influence

this amiable remark of the fair zenobia confirmed me in what i had
already begun to suspect that hollingsworth like many other
illustrious prophets reformers and philanthropists was likely to
make at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men
zenobia and priscilla these i believe unless my unworthy self might
be reckoned for a third were the only disciples of his mission and i
spent a great deal of time uselessly in trying to conjecture what
hollingsworth meant to do with them and they with him



ix hollingsworth zenobia priscilla

it is not i apprehend a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote
ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women if
the person under examination be one's self the result is pretty
certain to be diseased action of the heart almost before we can snatch
a second glance or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our
microscope we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations
magnify his peculiarities inevitably tear him into parts and of
course patch him very clumsily together again what wonder then
should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster which after
all though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real
personage may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves

thus as my conscience has often whispered me i did hollingsworth a
great wrong by prying into his character and am perhaps doing him as
great a one at this moment by putting faith in the discoveries which
i seemed to make but i could not help it had i loved him less i
might have used him better he and zenobia and priscilla both for
their own sakes and as connected with him were separated from the rest
of the community to my imagination and stood forth as the indices of
a problem which it was my business to solve other associates had a
portion of my time other matters amused me passing occurrences
carried me along with them while they lasted but here was the vortex
of my meditations around which they revolved and whitherward they too
continually tended in the midst of cheerful society i had often a
feeling of loneliness for it was impossible not to be sensible that
while these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre
i though probably reckoned as a friend by all was at best but a
secondary or tertiary personage with either of them

i loved hollingsworth as has already been enough expressed but it
impressed me more and more that there was a stern and dreadful
peculiarity in this man such as could not prove otherwise than
pernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too
intimate a connection with him he was not altogether human there
was something else in hollingsworth besides flesh and blood and
sympathies and affections and celestial spirit

this is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an
overruling purpose it does not so much impel them from without nor
even operate as a motive power within but grows incorporate with all
that they think and feel and finally converts them into little else
save that one principle when such begins to be the predicament it is
not cowardice but wisdom to avoid these victims they have no heart
no sympathy no reason no conscience they will keep no friend
unless he make himself the mirror of their purpose they will smite and
slay you and trample your dead corpse under foot all the more
readily if you take the first step with them and cannot take the
second and the third and every other step of their terribly strait
path they have an idol to which they consecrate themselves
high-priest and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is
most precious and never once seem to suspect so cunning has the devil
been with them that this false deity in whose iron features
immitigable to all the rest of mankind they see only benignity and
love is but a spectrum of the very priest himself projected upon the
surrounding darkness and the higher and purer the original object
and the more unselfishly it may have been taken up the slighter is the
probability that they can be led to recognize the process by which
godlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism

of course i am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated
in the attempt to make it adequate professed philanthropists have
gone far but no originally good man i presume ever went quite so far
as this let the reader abate whatever he deems fit the paragraph
may remain however both for its truth and its exaggeration as
strongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in
hollingsworth and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode
of observation was calculated to lead me the issue was that in
solitude i often shuddered at my friend in my recollection of his
dark and impressive countenance the features grew more sternly
prominent than the reality duskier in their depth and shadow and more
lurid in their light the frown that had merely flitted across his
brow seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle on
meeting him again i was often filled with remorse when his deep eyes
beamed kindly upon me as with the glow of a household fire that was
burning in a cave he is a man after all thought i his maker's
own truest image a philanthropic man not that steel engine of the
devil's contrivance a philanthropist but in my wood-walks and in my
silent chamber the dark face frowned at me again

when a young girl comes within the sphere of such a man she is as
perilously situated as the maiden whom in the old classical myths the
people used to expose to a dragon if i had any duty whatever in
reference to hollingsworth it was to endeavor to save priscilla from
that kind of personal worship which her sex is generally prone to
lavish upon saints and heroes it often requires but one smile out of
the hero's eyes into the girl's or woman's heart to transform this
devotion from a sentiment of the highest approval and confidence into
passionate love now hollingsworth smiled much upon priscilla more
than upon any other person if she thought him beautiful it was no
wonder i often thought him so with the expression of tender human
care and gentlest sympathy which she alone seemed to have power to call
out upon his features zenobia i suspect would have given her eyes
bright as they were for such a look it was the least that our poor
priscilla could do to give her heart for a great many of them there
was the more danger of this inasmuch as the footing on which we all
associated at blithedale was widely different from that of conventional
society while inclining us to the soft affections of the golden age
it seemed to authorize any individual of either sex to fall in love
with any other regardless of what would elsewhere be judged suitable
and prudent accordingly the tender passion was very rife among us in
various degrees of mildness or virulence but mostly passing away with
the state of things that had given it origin this was all well
enough but for a girl like priscilla and a woman like zenobia to
jostle one another in their love of a man like hollingsworth was
likely to be no child's play

had i been as cold-hearted as i sometimes thought myself nothing would
have interested me more than to witness the play of passions that must
thus have been evolved but in honest truth i would really have gone
far to save priscilla at least from the catastrophe in which such a
drama would be apt to terminate

priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl and still kept
budding and blossoming and daily putting on some new charm which you
no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had
previously possessed so unformed vague and without substance as
she had come to us it seemed as if we could see nature shaping out a
woman before our very eyes and yet had only a more reverential sense
of the mystery of a woman's soul and frame yesterday her cheek was
pale to-day it had a bloom priscilla's smile like a baby's first
one was a wondrous novelty her imperfections and shortcomings
affected me with a kind of playful pathos which was as absolutely
bewitching a sensation as ever i experienced after she had been a
month or two at blithedale her animal spirits waxed high and kept her
pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment impelling her to
far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure she was
very fond of playing with the other girls out of doors there is
hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of
young girls almost women grown at play and so giving themselves up
to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground

girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys more
untamable and regardless of rule and limit with an ever-shifting
variety breaking continually into new modes of fun yet with a
harmonious propriety through all their steps their voices appear
free as the wind but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible
to us young men and boys on the other hand play according to
recognized law old traditionary games permitting no caprioles of
fancy but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts
for young or old in play or in earnest man is prone to be a brute

especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race
with her head thrown back her limbs moving more friskily than they
need and an air between that of a bird and a young colt but
priscilla's peculiar charm in a foot-race was the weakness and
irregularity with which she ran growing up without exercise except
to her poor little fingers she had never yet acquired the perfect use
of her legs setting buoyantly forth therefore as if no rival less
swift than atalanta could compete with her she ran falteringly and
often tumbled on the grass such an incident though it seems too
slight to think of was a thing to laugh at but which brought the
water into one's eyes and lingered in the memory after far greater
joys and sorrows were wept out of it as antiquated trash priscilla's
life as i beheld it was full of trifles that affected me in just this
way

when she had come to be quite at home among us i used to fancy that
priscilla played more pranks and perpetrated more mischief than any
other girl in the community for example i once heard silas foster
in a very gruff voice threatening to rivet three horseshoes round
priscilla's neck and chain her to a post because she with some other
young people had clambered upon a load of hay and caused it to slide
off the cart how she made her peace i never knew but very soon
afterwards i saw old silas with his brawny hands round priscilla's
waist swinging her to and fro and finally depositing her on one of
the oxen to take her first lessons in riding she met with terrible
mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow she let the poultry into the
garden she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in
charge she broke crockery she dropt our biggest water pitcher into
the well and except with her needle and those little wooden
instruments for purse-making was as unserviceable a member of society
as any young lady in the land there was no other sort of efficiency
about her yet everybody was kind to priscilla everybody loved her
and laughed at her to her face and did not laugh behind her back
everybody would have given her half of his last crust or the bigger
share of his plum-cake these were pretty certain indications that we
were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl and considered
her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle
with the world and hollingsworth perhaps because he had been the
means of introducing priscilla to her new abode appeared to recognize
her as his own especial charge

her simple careless childish flow of spirits often made me sad she
seemed to me like a butterfly at play in a flickering bit of sunshine
and mistaking it for a broad and eternal summer we sometimes hold
mirth to a stricter accountability than sorrow it must show good
cause or the echo of its laughter comes back drearily priscilla's
gayety moreover was of a nature that showed me how delicate an
instrument she was and what fragile harp-strings were her nerves as
they made sweet music at the airiest touch it would require but a
stronger one to burst them all asunder absurd as it might be i tried
to reason with her and persuade her not to be so joyous thinking
that if she would draw less lavishly upon her fund of happiness it
would last the longer i remember doing so one summer evening when
we tired laborers sat looking on like goldsmith's old folks under the
village thorn-tree while the young people were at their sports

what is the use or sense of being so very gay i said to priscilla
while she was taking breath after a great frolic i love to see a
sufficient cause for everything and i can see none for this pray
tell me now what kind of a world you imagine this to be which you
are so merry in

i never think about it at all answered priscilla laughing but
this i am sure of that it is a world where everybody is kind to me
and where i love everybody my heart keeps dancing within me and all
the foolish things which you see me do are only the motions of my
heart how can i be dismal if my heart will not let me

have you nothing dismal to remember i suggested if not then
indeed you are very fortunate

ah said priscilla slowly

and then came that unintelligible gesture when she seemed to be
listening to a distant voice

for my part i continued beneficently seeking to overshadow her with
my own sombre humor my past life has been a tiresome one enough yet
i would rather look backward ten times than forward once for little
as we know of our life to come we may be very sure for one thing
that the good we aim at will not be attained people never do get just
the good they seek if it come at all it is something else which
they never dreamed of and did not particularly want then again we
may rest certain that our friends of to-day will not be our friends of
a few years hence but if we keep one of them it will be at the
expense of the others and most probably we shall keep none to be
sure there are more to be had but who cares about making a new set of
friends even should they be better than those around us

not i said priscilla i will live and die with these

well but let the future go resumed i as for the present moment
if we could look into the hearts where we wish to be most valued what
should you expect to see one's own likeness in the innermost
holiest niche ah i don't know it may not be there at all it may
be a dusty image thrust aside into a corner and by and by to be flung
out of doors where any foot may trample upon it if not to-day then
to-morrow and so priscilla i do not see much wisdom in being so
very merry in this kind of a world

it had taken me nearly seven years of worldly life to hive up the
bitter honey which i here offered to priscilla and she rejected it

i don't believe one word of what you say she replied laughing anew
you made me sad for a minute by talking about the past but the past
never comes back again do we dream the same dream twice there is
nothing else that i am afraid of

so away she ran and fell down on the green grass as it was often her
luck to do but got up again without any harm

priscilla priscilla cried hollingsworth who was sitting on the
doorstep you had better not run any more to-night you will weary
yourself too much and do not sit down out of doors for there is a
heavy dew beginning to fall

at his first word she went and sat down under the porch at
hollingsworth's feet entirely contented and happy what charm was
there in his rude massiveness that so attracted and soothed this
shadow-like girl it appeared to me who have always been curious in
such matters that priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of
felicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced
hearts before they begin to suspect what is going on within them it
transports them to the seventh heaven and if you ask what brought them
thither they neither can tell nor care to learn but cherish an
ecstatic faith that there they shall abide forever

zenobia was in the doorway not far from hollingsworth she gazed at
priscilla in a very singular way indeed it was a sight worth gazing
at and a beautiful sight too as the fair girl sat at the feet of
that dark powerful figure her air while perfectly modest delicate
and virgin-like denoted her as swayed by hollingsworth attracted to
him and unconsciously seeking to rest upon his strength i could not
turn away my own eyes but hoped that nobody save zenobia and myself
was witnessing this picture it is before me now with the evening
twilight a little deepened by the dusk of memory

come hither priscilla said zenobia i have something to say to
you

she spoke in little more than a whisper but it is strange how
expressive of moods a whisper may often be priscilla felt at once
that something had gone wrong

are you angry with me she asked rising slowly and standing before
zenobia in a drooping attitude what have i done i hope you are not
angry

no no priscilla said hollingsworth smiling i will answer for
it she is not you are the one little person in the world with whom
nobody can be angry

angry with you child what a silly idea exclaimed zenobia
laughing no indeed but my dear priscilla you are getting to be
so very pretty that you absolutely need a duenna and as i am older
than you and have had my own little experience of life and think
myself exceedingly sage i intend to fill the place of a maiden aunt
every day i shall give you a lecture a quarter of an hour in length
on the morals manners and proprieties of social life when our
pastoral shall be quite played out priscilla my worldly wisdom may
stand you in good stead

i am afraid you are angry with me repeated priscilla sadly for
while she seemed as impressible as wax the girl often showed a
persistency in her own ideas as stubborn as it was gentle

dear me what can i say to the child cried zenobia in a tone of
humorous vexation well well since you insist on my being angry
come to my room this moment and let me beat you

zenobia bade hollingsworth good-night very sweetly and nodded to me
with a smile but just as she turned aside with priscilla into the
dimness of the porch i caught another glance at her countenance it
would have made the fortune of a tragic actress could she have
borrowed it for the moment when she fumbles in her bosom for the
concealed dagger or the exceedingly sharp bodkin or mingles the
ratsbane in her lover's bowl of wine or her rival's cup of tea not
that i in the least anticipated any such catastrophe it being a
remarkable truth that custom has in no one point a greater sway than
over our modes of wreaking our wild passions and besides had we been
in italy instead of new england it was hardly yet a crisis for the
dagger or the bowl

it often amazed me however that hollingsworth should show himself so
recklessly tender towards priscilla and never once seem to think of
the effect which it might have upon her heart but the man as i have
endeavored to explain was thrown completely off his moral balance and
quite bewildered as to his personal relations by his great excrescence
of a philanthropic scheme i used to see or fancy indications that
he was not altogether obtuse to zenobia's influence as a woman no
doubt however he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of priscilla's
silent sympathy with his purposes so unalloyed with criticism and
therefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation which always
involves a possible reserve of latent censure a man poet prophet
or whatever he may be readily persuades himself of his right to all
the worship that is voluntarily tendered in requital of so rich
benefits as he was to confer upon mankind it would have been hard to
deny hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart which he
held in his hand and smelled too like a rosebud but what if while
pressing out its fragrance he should crush the tender rosebud in his
grasp

as for zenobia i saw no occasion to give myself any trouble with her
native strength and her experience of the world she could not be
supposed to need any help of mine nevertheless i was really generous
enough to feel some little interest likewise for zenobia with all her
faults which might have been a great many besides the abundance that i
knew of she possessed noble traits and a heart which must at least
have been valuable while new and she seemed ready to fling it away as
uncalculatingly as priscilla herself i could not but suspect that if
merely at play with hollingsworth she was sporting with a power which
she did not fully estimate or if in earnest it might chance between
zenobia's passionate force and his dark self-delusive egotism to turn
out such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic
catastrophe though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it

meantime the gossip of the community set them down as a pair of
lovers they took walks together and were not seldom encountered in
the wood-paths hollingsworth deeply discoursing in tones solemn and
sternly pathetic zenobia with a rich glow on her cheeks and her eyes
softened from their ordinary brightness looked so beautiful that had
her companion been ten times a philanthropist it seemed impossible but
that one glance should melt him back into a man oftener than anywhere
else they went to a certain point on the slope of a pasture
commanding nearly the whole of our own domain besides a view of the
river and an airy prospect of many distant hills the bond of our
community was such that the members had the privilege of building
cottages for their own residence within our precincts thus laying a
hearthstone and fencing in a home private and peculiar to all desirable
extent while yet the inhabitants should continue to share the
advantages of an associated life it was inferred that hollingsworth
and zenobia intended to rear their dwelling on this favorite spot

i mentioned those rumors to hollingsworth in a playful way

had you consulted me i went on to observe i should have
recommended a site farther to the left just a little withdrawn into
the wood with two or three peeps at the prospect among the trees you
will be in the shady vale of years long before you can raise any better
kind of shade around your cottage if you build it on this bare slope

but i offer my edifice as a spectacle to the world said
hollingsworth that it may take example and build many another like
it therefore i mean to set it on the open hillside

twist these words how i might they offered no very satisfactory
import it seemed hardly probable that hollingsworth should care about
educating the public taste in the department of cottage architecture
desirable as such improvement certainly was



x a visitor from town

hollingsworth and i we had been hoeing potatoes that forenoon while
the rest of the fraternity were engaged in a distant quarter of the
farm sat under a clump of maples eating our eleven o'clock lunch
when we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field he had
admitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile and seemed to
have a purpose of speaking with us

and by the bye we were favored with many visits at blithedale
especially from people who sympathized with our theories and perhaps
held themselves ready to unite in our actual experiment as soon as
there should appear a reliable promise of its success it was rather
ludicrous indeed to me at least whose enthusiasm had insensibly
been exhaled together with the perspiration of many a hard day's toil
it was absolutely funny therefore to observe what a glory was shed
about our life and labors in the imaginations of these longing
proselytes in their view we were as poetical as arcadians besides
being as practical as the hardest-fisted husbandmen in massachusetts
we did not it is true spend much time in piping to our sheep or
warbling our innocent loves to the sisterhood but they gave us credit
for imbuing the ordinary rustic occupations with a kind of religious
poetry insomuch that our very cow-yards and pig-sties were as
delightfully fragrant as a flower garden nothing used to please me
more than to see one of these lay enthusiasts snatch up a hoe as they
were very prone to do and set to work with a vigor that perhaps
carried him through about a dozen ill-directed strokes men are
wonderfully soon satisfied in this day of shameful bodily enervation
when from one end of life to the other such multitudes never taste
the sweet weariness that follows accustomed toil i seldom saw the new
enthusiasm that did not grow as flimsy and flaccid as the proselyte's
moistened shirt-collar with a quarter of an hour's active labor under
a july sun

but the person now at hand had not at all the air of one of these
amiable visionaries he was an elderly man dressed rather shabbily
yet decently enough in a gray frock-coat faded towards a brown hue
and wore a broad-brimmed white hat of the fashion of several years
gone by his hair was perfect silver without a dark thread in the
whole of it his nose though it had a scarlet tip by no means
indicated the jollity of which a red nose is the generally admitted
symbol he was a subdued undemonstrative old man who would doubtless
drink a glass of liquor now and then and probably more than was good
for him not however with a purpose of undue exhilaration but in
the hope of bringing his spirits up to the ordinary level of the
world's cheerfulness drawing nearer there was a shy look about him
as if he were ashamed of his poverty or at any rate for some reason
or other would rather have us glance at him sidelong than take a full
front view he had a queer appearance of hiding himself behind the
patch on his left eye

i know this old gentleman said i to hollingsworth as we sat
observing him that is i have met him a hundred times in town and
have often amused my fancy with wondering what he was before he came to
be what he is he haunts restaurants and such places and has an odd
way of lurking in corners or getting behind a door whenever
practicable and holding out his hand with some little article in it
which he wishes you to buy the eye of the world seems to trouble him
although he necessarily lives so much in it i never expected to see
him in an open field

have you learned anything of his history asked hollingsworth

not a circumstance i answered but there must be something curious
in it i take him to be a harmless sort of a person and a tolerably
honest one but his manners being so furtive remind me of those of a
rat a rat without the mischief the fierce eye the teeth to bite
with or the desire to bite see now he means to skulk along that
fringe of bushes and approach us on the other side of our clump of
maples

we soon heard the old man's velvet tread on the grass indicating that
he had arrived within a few feet of where we sat

good-morning mr moodie said hollingsworth addressing the stranger
as an acquaintance you must have had a hot and tiresome walk from the
city sit down and take a morsel of our bread and cheese

the visitor made a grateful little murmur of acquiescence and sat down
in a spot somewhat removed so that glancing round i could see his
gray pantaloons and dusty shoes while his upper part was mostly hidden
behind the shrubbery nor did he come forth from this retirement
during the whole of the interview that followed we handed him such
food as we had together with a brown jug of molasses and water would
that it had been brandy or some thing better for the sake of his
chill old heart like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an
enshrined and invisible idol i have no idea that he really lacked
sustenance but it was quite touching nevertheless to hear him
nibbling away at our crusts

mr moodie said i do you remember selling me one of those very
pretty little silk purses of which you seem to have a monopoly in the
market i keep it to this day i can assure you

ah thank you said our guest yes mr coverdale i used to sell a
good many of those little purses

he spoke languidly and only those few words like a watch with an
inelastic spring that just ticks a moment or two and stops again he
seemed a very forlorn old man in the wantonness of youth strength
and comfortable condition making my prey of people's individualities
as my custom was i tried to identify my mind with the old fellow's
and take his view of the world as if looking through a smoke-blackened
glass at the sun it robbed the landscape of all its life those
pleasantly swelling slopes of our farm descending towards the wide
meadows through which sluggishly circled the brimful tide of the
charles bathing the long sedges on its hither and farther shores the
broad sunny gleam over the winding water that peculiar
picturesqueness of the scene where capes and headlands put themselves
boldly forth upon the perfect level of the meadow as into a green
lake with inlets between the promontories the shadowy woodland with
twinkling showers of light falling into its depths the sultry
heat-vapor which rose everywhere like incense and in which my soul
delighted as indicating so rich a fervor in the passionate day and in
the earth that was burning with its love i beheld all these things as
through old moodie's eyes when my eyes are dimmer than they have yet
come to be i will go thither again and see if i did not catch the
tone of his mind aright and if the cold and lifeless tint of his
perceptions be not then repeated in my own

yet it was unaccountable to myself the interest that i felt in him

have you any objection said i to telling me who made those little
purses

gentlemen have often asked me that said moodie slowly but i shake
my head and say little or nothing and creep out of the way as well as
i can i am a man of few words and if gentlemen were to be told one
thing they would be very apt i suppose to ask me another but it
happens just now mr coverdale that you can tell me more about the
maker of those little purses than i can tell you

why do you trouble him with needless questions coverdale
interrupted hollingsworth you must have known long ago that it was
priscilla and so my good friend you have come to see her well i
am glad of it you will find her altered very much for the better
since that winter evening when you put her into my charge why
priscilla has a bloom in her cheeks now

has my pale little girl a bloom repeated moodie with a kind of slow
wonder priscilla with a bloom in her cheeks ah i am afraid i
shall not know my little girl and is she happy

just as happy as a bird answered hollingsworth

then gentlemen said our guest apprehensively i don't think it
well for me to go any farther i crept hitherward only to ask about
priscilla and now that you have told me such good news perhaps i can
do no better than to creep back again if she were to see this old
face of mine the child would remember some very sad times which we
have spent together some very sad times indeed she has forgotten
them i know them and me else she could not be so happy nor have a
bloom in her cheeks yes yes yes continued he still with the same
torpid utterance with many thanks to you mr hollingsworth i will
creep back to town again

you shall do no such thing mr moodie said hollingsworth bluffly
priscilla often speaks of you and if there lacks anything to make her
cheeks bloom like two damask roses i'll venture to say it is just the
sight of your face come we will go and find her

mr hollingsworth said the old man in his hesitating way

well answered hollingsworth

has there been any call for priscilla asked moodie and though his
face was hidden from us his tone gave a sure indication of the
mysterious nod and wink with which he put the question you know i
think sir what i mean

i have not the remotest suspicion what you mean mr moodie replied
hollingsworth nobody to my knowledge has called for priscilla
except yourself but come we are losing time and i have several
things to say to you by the way

and mr hollingsworth repeated moodie

well again cried my friend rather impatiently what now

there is a lady here said the old man and his voice lost some of
its wearisome hesitation you will account it a very strange matter
for me to talk about but i chanced to know this lady when she was but
a little child if i am rightly informed she has grown to be a very
fine woman and makes a brilliant figure in the world with her beauty
and her talents and her noble way of spending her riches i should
recognize this lady so people tell me by a magnificent flower in her
hair

what a rich tinge it gives to his colorless ideas when he speaks of
zenobia i whispered to hollingsworth but how can there possibly
be any interest or connecting link between him and her

the old man for years past whispered hollingsworth has been a
little out of his right mind as you probably see

what i would inquire resumed moodie is whether this beautiful lady
is kind to my poor priscilla

very kind said hollingsworth

does she love her asked moodie

it should seem so answered my friend they are always together

like a gentlewoman and her maid-servant i fancy suggested the old
man

there was something so singular in his way of saying this that i could
not resist the impulse to turn quite round so as to catch a glimpse of
his face almost imagining that i should see another person than old
moodie but there he sat with the patched side of his face towards me

like an elder and younger sister rather replied hollingsworth

ah said moodie more complacently for his latter tones had harshness
and acidity in them it would gladden my old heart to witness that
if one thing would make me happier than another mr hollingsworth it
would be to see that beautiful lady holding my little girl by the hand

come along said hollingsworth and perhaps you may

after a little more delay on the part of our freakish visitor they set
forth together old moodie keeping a step or two behind hollingsworth
so that the latter could not very conveniently look him in the face i
remained under the tuft of maples doing my utmost to draw an inference
from the scene that had just passed in spite of hollingsworth's
off-hand explanation it did not strike me that our strange guest was
really beside himself but only that his mind needed screwing up like
an instrument long out of tune the strings of which have ceased to
vibrate smartly and sharply methought it would be profitable for us
projectors of a happy life to welcome this old gray shadow and
cherish him as one of us and let him creep about our domain in order
that he might be a little merrier for our sakes and we sometimes a
little sadder for his human destinies look ominous without some
perceptible intermixture of the sable or the gray and then too
should any of our fraternity grow feverish with an over-exulting sense
of prosperity it would be a sort of cooling regimen to slink off into
the woods and spend an hour or a day or as many days as might be
requisite to the cure in uninterrupted communion with this deplorable
old moodie

going homeward to dinner i had a glimpse of him behind the trunk of a
tree gazing earnestly towards a particular window of the farmhouse
and by and by priscilla appeared at this window playfully drawing
along zenobia who looked as bright as the very day that was blazing
down upon us only not by many degrees so well advanced towards her
noon i was convinced that this pretty sight must have been purposely
arranged by priscilla for the old man to see but either the girl held
her too long or her fondness was resented as too great a freedom for
zenobia suddenly put priscilla decidedly away and gave her a haughty
look as from a mistress to a dependant old moodie shook his head
and again and again i saw him shake it as he withdrew along the road
and at the last point whence the farmhouse was visible he turned and
shook his uplifted staff



xi the wood-path

not long after the preceding incident in order to get the ache of too
constant labor out of my bones and to relieve my spirit of the
irksomeness of a settled routine i took a holiday it was my purpose
to spend it all alone from breakfast-time till twilight in the
deepest wood-seclusion that lay anywhere around us though fond of
society i was so constituted as to need these occasional retirements
even in a life like that of blithedale which was itself characterized
by a remoteness from the world unless renewed by a yet further
withdrawal towards the inner circle of self-communion i lost the
better part of my individuality my thoughts became of little worth
and my sensibilities grew as arid as a tuft of moss a thing whose life
is in the shade the rain or the noontide dew crumbling in the
sunshine after long expectance of a shower so with my heart full of
a drowsy pleasure and cautious not to dissipate my mood by previous
intercourse with any one i hurried away and was soon pacing a
wood-path arched overhead with boughs and dusky-brown beneath my feet

at first i walked very swiftly as if the heavy flood tide of social
life were roaring at my heels and would outstrip and overwhelm me
without all the better diligence in my escape but threading the more
distant windings of the track i abated my pace and looked about me
for some side-aisle that should admit me into the innermost sanctuary
of this green cathedral just as in human acquaintanceship a casual
opening sometimes lets us all of a sudden into the long-sought
intimacy of a mysterious heart so much was i absorbed in my
reflections or rather in my mood the substance of which was as yet
too shapeless to be called thought that footsteps rustled on the
leaves and a figure passed me by almost without impressing either the
sound or sight upon my consciousness

a moment afterwards i heard a voice at a little distance behind me
speaking so sharply and impertinently that it made a complete discord
with my spiritual state and caused the latter to vanish as abruptly as
when you thrust a finger into a soap-bubble

halloo friend cried this most unseasonable voice stop a moment
i say i must have a word with you

i turned about in a humor ludicrously irate in the first place the
interruption at any rate was a grievous injury then the tone
displeased me and finally unless there be real affection in his
heart a man cannot such is the bad state to which the world has
brought itself cannot more effectually show his contempt for a
brother mortal nor more gallingly assume a position of superiority
than by addressing him as friend especially does the misapplication
of this phrase bring out that latent hostility which is sure to animate
peculiar sects and those who with however generous a purpose have
sequestered themselves from the crowd a feeling it is true which may
be hidden in some dog-kennel of the heart grumbling there in the
darkness but is never quite extinct until the dissenting party have
gained power and scope enough to treat the world generously for my
part i should have taken it as far less an insult to be styled
fellow clown or bumpkin to either of these appellations my
rustic garb it was a linen blouse with checked shirt and striped
pantaloons a chip hat on my head and a rough hickory stick in my
hand very fairly entitled me as the case stood my temper darted at
once to the opposite pole not friend but enemy

what do you want with me said i facing about

come a little nearer friend said the stranger beckoning

no answered i if i can do anything for you without too much
trouble to myself say so but recollect if you please that you are
not speaking to an acquaintance much less a friend

upon my word i believe not retorted he looking at me with some
curiosity and lifting his hat he made me a salute which had enough
of sarcasm to be offensive and just enough of doubtful courtesy to
render any resentment of it absurd but i ask your pardon i
recognize a little mistake if i may take the liberty to suppose it
you sir are probably one of the aesthetic or shall i rather say
ecstatic laborers who have planted themselves hereabouts this is
your forest of arden and you are either the banished duke in person
or one of the chief nobles in his train the melancholy jacques
perhaps be it so in that case you can probably do me a favor

i never in my life felt less inclined to confer a favor on any man

i am busy said i

so unexpectedly had the stranger made me sensible of his presence that
he had almost the effect of an apparition and certainly a less
appropriate one taking into view the dim woodland solitude about us
than if the salvage man of antiquity hirsute and cinctured with a
leafy girdle had started out of a thicket he was still young
seemingly a little under thirty of a tall and well-developed figure
and as handsome a man as ever i beheld the style of his beauty
however though a masculine style did not at all commend itself to my
taste his countenance i hardly know how to describe the
peculiarity had an indecorum in it a kind of rudeness a hard
coarse forth-putting freedom of expression which no degree of
external polish could have abated one single jot not that it was
vulgar but he had no fineness of nature there was in his eyes
although they might have artifice enough of another sort the naked
exposure of something that ought not to be left prominent with these
vague allusions to what i have seen in other faces as well as his i
leave the quality to be comprehended best because with an intuitive
repugnance by those who possess least of it

his hair as well as his beard and mustache was coal-black his eyes
too were black and sparkling and his teeth remarkably brilliant he
was rather carelessly but well and fashionably dressed in a
summer-morning costume there was a gold chain exquisitely wrought
across his vest i never saw a smoother or whiter gloss than that upon
his shirt-bosom which had a pin in it set with a gem that glimmered
in the leafy shadow where he stood like a living tip of fire he
carried a stick with a wooden head carved in vivid imitation of that
of a serpent i hated him partly i do believe from a comparison of
my own homely garb with his well-ordered foppishness

well sir said i a little ashamed of my first irritation but still
with no waste of civility be pleased to speak at once as i have my
own business in hand

i regret that my mode of addressing you was a little unfortunate
said the stranger smiling for he seemed a very acute sort of person
and saw in some degree how i stood affected towards him i intended
no offence and shall certainly comport myself with due ceremony
hereafter i merely wish to make a few inquiries respecting a lady
formerly of my acquaintance who is now resident in your community
and i believe largely concerned in your social enterprise you call
her i think zenobia

that is her name in literature observed i a name too which
possibly she may permit her private friends to know and address her
by but not one which they feel at liberty to recognize when used of
her personally by a stranger or casual acquaintance

indeed answered this disagreeable person and he turned aside his
face for an instant with a brief laugh which struck me as a noteworthy
expression of his character perhaps i might put forward a claim on
your own grounds to call the lady by a name so appropriate to her
splendid qualities but i am willing to know her by any cognomen that
you may suggest

heartily wishing that he would be either a little more offensive or a
good deal less so or break off our intercourse altogether i mentioned
zenobia's real name

true said he and in general society i have never heard her called
otherwise and after all our discussion of the point has been
gratuitous my object is only to inquire when where and how this
lady may most conveniently be seen

at her present residence of course i replied you have but to go
thither and ask for her this very path will lead you within sight of
the house so i wish you good-morning

one moment if you please said the stranger the course you
indicate would certainly be the proper one in an ordinary morning
call but my business is private personal and somewhat peculiar
now in a community like this i should judge that any little
occurrence is likely to be discussed rather more minutely than would
quite suit my views i refer solely to myself you understand and
without intimating that it would be other than a matter of entire
indifference to the lady in short i especially desire to see her in
private if her habits are such as i have known them she is probably
often to be met with in the woods or by the river-side and i think
you could do me the favor to point out some favorite walk where about
this hour i might be fortunate enough to gain an interview

i reflected that it would be quite a supererogatory piece of quixotism
in me to undertake the guardianship of zenobia who for my pains
would only make me the butt of endless ridicule should the fact ever
come to her knowledge i therefore described a spot which as often as
any other was zenobia's resort at this period of the day nor was it
so remote from the farmhouse as to leave her in much peril whatever
might be the stranger's character

a single word more said he and his black eyes sparkled at me
whether with fun or malice i knew not but certainly as if the devil
were peeping out of them among your fraternity i understand there
is a certain holy and benevolent blacksmith a man of iron in more
senses than one a rough cross-grained well-meaning individual
rather boorish in his manners as might be expected and by no means of
the highest intellectual cultivation he is a philanthropical
lecturer with two or three disciples and a scheme of his own the
preliminary step in which involves a large purchase of land and the
erection of a spacious edifice at an expense considerably beyond his
means inasmuch as these are to be reckoned in copper or old iron much
more conveniently than in gold or silver he hammers away upon his one
topic as lustily as ever he did upon a horseshoe do you know such a
person i shook my head and was turning away our friend he
continued is described to me as a brawny shaggy grim and
ill-favored personage not particularly well calculated one would say
to insinuate himself with the softer sex yet so far has this honest
fellow succeeded with one lady whom we wot of that he anticipates
from her abundant resources the necessary funds for realizing his plan
in brick and mortar

here the stranger seemed to be so much amused with his sketch of
hollingsworth's character and purposes that he burst into a fit of
merriment of the same nature as the brief metallic laugh already
alluded to but immensely prolonged and enlarged in the excess of his
delight he opened his mouth wide and disclosed a gold band around the
upper part of his teeth thereby making it apparent that every one of
his brilliant grinders and incisors was a sham this discovery
affected me very oddly

i felt as if the whole man were a moral and physical humbug his
wonderful beauty of face for aught i knew might be removable like a
mask and tall and comely as his figure looked he was perhaps but a
wizened little elf gray and decrepit with nothing genuine about him
save the wicked expression of his grin the fantasy of his spectral
character so wrought upon me together with the contagion of his
strange mirth on my sympathies that i soon began to laugh as loudly as
himself

by and by he paused all at once so suddenly indeed that my own
cachinnation lasted a moment longer

ah excuse me said he our interview seems to proceed more merrily
than it began

it ends here answered i and i take shame to myself that my folly
has lost me the right of resenting your ridicule of a friend

pray allow me said the stranger approaching a step nearer and
laying his gloved hand on my sleeve one other favor i must ask of
you you have a young person here at blithedale of whom i have
heard whom perhaps i have known and in whom at all events i
take a peculiar interest she is one of those delicate nervous young
creatures not uncommon in new england and whom i suppose to have
become what we find them by the gradual refining away of the physical
system among your women some philosophers choose to glorify this
habit of body by terming it spiritual but in my opinion it is rather
the effect of unwholesome food bad air lack of outdoor exercise and
neglect of bathing on the part of these damsels and their female
progenitors all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia zenobia
even with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality is far the better
model of womanhood but to revert again to this young person she
goes among you by the name of priscilla could you possibly afford me
the means of speaking with her

you have made so many inquiries of me i observed that i may at
least trouble you with one what is your name

he offered me a card with professor westervelt engraved on it at
the same time as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial
dignity so often assumed on very questionable grounds he put on a
pair of spectacles which so altered the character of his face that i
hardly knew him again but i liked the present aspect no better than
the former one

i must decline any further connection with your affairs said i
drawing back i have told you where to find zenobia as for
priscilla she has closer friends than myself through whom if they
see fit you can gain access to her

in that case returned the professor ceremoniously raising his hat
good-morning to you

he took his departure and was soon out of sight among the windings of
the wood-path but after a little reflection i could not help
regretting that i had so peremptorily broken off the interview while
the stranger seemed inclined to continue it his evident knowledge of
matters affecting my three friends might have led to disclosures or
inferences that would perhaps have been serviceable i was
particularly struck with the fact that ever since the appearance of
priscilla it had been the tendency of events to suggest and establish
a connection between zenobia and her she had come in the first
instance as if with the sole purpose of claiming zenobia's protection
old moodie's visit it appeared was chiefly to ascertain whether this
object had been accomplished and here to-day was the questionable
professor linking one with the other in his inquiries and seeking
communication with both

meanwhile my inclination for a ramble having been balked i lingered
in the vicinity of the farm with perhaps a vague idea that some new
event would grow out of westervelt's proposed interview with zenobia
my own part in these transactions was singularly subordinate it
resembled that of the chorus in a classic play which seems to be set
aloof from the possibility of personal concernment and bestows the
whole measure of its hope or fear its exultation or sorrow on the
fortunes of others between whom and itself this sympathy is the only
bond destiny it may be the most skilful of stage managers seldom
chooses to arrange its scenes and carry forward its drama without
securing the presence of at least one calm observer it is his office
to give applause when due and sometimes an inevitable tear to detect
the final fitness of incident to character and distil in his
long-brooding thought the whole morality of the performance

not to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation
and at the same time to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny
nor mortals might desire my presence i remained pretty near the verge
of the woodlands my position was off the track of zenobia's customary
walk yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily
have brought me thither



xii coverdale's hermitage

long since in this part of our circumjacent wood i had found out for
myself a little hermitage it was a kind of leafy cave high upward
into the air among the midmost branches of a white-pine tree a wild
grapevine of unusual size and luxuriance had twined and twisted
itself up into the tree and after wreathing the entanglement of its
tendrils around almost every bough had caught hold of three or four
neighboring trees and married the whole clump with a perfectly
inextricable knot of polygamy once while sheltering myself from a
summer shower the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly
impervious mass of foliage the branches yielded me a passage and
closed again beneath as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed far
aloft around the stem of the central pine behold a perfect nest for
robinson crusoe or king charles a hollow chamber of rare seclusion
had been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches which the
vine had lovingly strangled with its embrace burying them from the
light of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves it cost me but
little ingenuity to enlarge the interior and open loopholes through
the verdant walls had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon i
should have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither where
our next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the
clump

it was an admirable place to make verses tuning the rhythm to the
breezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves or to
meditate an essay for the dial in which the many tongues of nature
whispered mysteries and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of
wind to speak out the solution of its riddle being so pervious to
air-currents it was just the nook too for the enjoyment of a cigar
this hermitage was my one exclusive possession while i counted myself a
brother of the socialists it symbolized my individuality and aided
me in keeping it inviolate none ever found me out in it except
once a squirrel i brought thither no guest because after
hollingsworth failed me there was no longer the man alive with whom i
could think of sharing all so there i used to sit owl-like yet not
without liberal and hospitable thoughts i counted the innumerable
clusters of my vine and fore-reckoned the abundance of my vintage it
gladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the community when like an
allegorical figure of rich october i should make my appearance with
shoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes and some of the
crushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain

ascending into this natural turret i peeped in turn out of several of
its small windows the pine-tree being ancient rose high above the
rest of the wood which was of comparatively recent growth even where
i sat about midway between the root and the topmost bough my position
was lofty enough to serve as an observatory not for starry
investigations but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as
infinite as that of the planets through one loophole i saw the river
lapsing calmly onward while in the meadow near its brink a few of
the brethren were digging peat for our winter's fuel on the interior
cart-road of our farm i discerned hollingsworth with a yoke of oxen
hitched to a drag of stones that were to be piled into a fence on
which we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor the
harsh tones of his voice shouting to the sluggish steers made me
sensible even at such a distance that he was ill at ease and that
the balked philanthropist had the battle-spirit in his heart

haw buck quoth he come along there ye lazy ones what are ye
about now gee

mankind in hollingsworth's opinion thought i is but another yoke
of oxen as stubborn stupid and sluggish as our old brown and bright
he vituperates us aloud and curses us in his heart and will begin to
prick us with the goad-stick by and by but are we his oxen and
what right has he to be the driver and why when there is enough else
to do should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load
of his philanthropic absurdities at my height above the earth the
whole matter looks ridiculous

turning towards the farmhouse i saw priscilla for though a great way
off the eye of faith assured me that it was she sitting at zenobia's
window and making little purses i suppose or perhaps mending the
community's old linen a bird flew past my tree and as it clove its
way onward into the sunny atmosphere i flung it a message for
priscilla

tell her said i that her fragile thread of life has inextricably
knotted itself with other and tougher threads and most likely it will
be broken tell her that zenobia will not be long her friend say that
hollingsworth's heart is on fire with his own purpose but icy for all
human affection and that if she has given him her love it is like
casting a flower into a sepulchre and say that if any mortal really
cares for her it is myself and not even i for her realities poor
little seamstress as zenobia rightly called her but for the
fancy-work with which i have idly decked her out

the pleasant scent of the wood evolved by the hot sun stole up to my
nostrils as if i had been an idol in its niche many trees mingled
their fragrance into a thousand-fold odor possibly there was a
sensual influence in the broad light of noon that lay beneath me it
may have been the cause in part that i suddenly found myself
possessed by a mood of disbelief in moral beauty or heroism and a
conviction of the folly of attempting to benefit the world our
especial scheme of reform which from my observatory i could take in
with the bodily eye looked so ridiculous that it was impossible not to
laugh aloud

but the joke is a little too heavy thought i if i were wise i
should get out of the scrape with all diligence and then laugh at my
companions for remaining in it

while thus musing i heard with perfect distinctness somewhere in the
wood beneath the peculiar laugh which i have described as one of the
disagreeable characteristics of professor westervelt it brought my
thoughts back to our recent interview i recognized as chiefly due to
this man's influence the sceptical and sneering view which just now had
filled my mental vision in regard to all life's better purposes and
it was through his eyes more than my own that i was looking at
hollingsworth with his glorious if impracticable dream and at the
noble earthliness of zenobia's character and even at priscilla whose
impalpable grace lay so singularly between disease and beauty the
essential charm of each had vanished there are some spheres the
contact with which inevitably degrades the high debases the pure
deforms the beautiful it must be a mind of uncommon strength and
little impressibility that can permit itself the habit of such
intercourse and not be permanently deteriorated and yet the
professor's tone represented that of worldly society at large where a
cold scepticism smothers what it can of our spiritual aspirations and
makes the rest ridiculous i detested this kind of man and all the
more because a part of my own nature showed itself responsive to him

voices were now approaching through the region of the wood which lay in
the vicinity of my tree soon i caught glimpses of two figures a
woman and a man zenobia and the stranger earnestly talking together
as they advanced

zenobia had a rich though varying color it was most of the while a
flame and anon a sudden paleness her eyes glowed so that their
light sometimes flashed upward to me as when the sun throws a dazzle
from some bright object on the ground her gestures were free and
strikingly impressive the whole woman was alive with a passionate
intensity which i now perceived to be the phase in which her beauty
culminated any passion would have become her well and passionate
love perhaps the best of all this was not love but anger largely
intermixed with scorn yet the idea strangely forced itself upon me
that there was a sort of familiarity between these two companions
necessarily the result of an intimate love on zenobia's part at
least in days gone by but which had prolonged itself into as
intimate a hatred for all futurity as they passed among the trees
reckless as her movement was she took good heed that even the hem of
her garment should not brush against the stranger's person i wondered
whether there had always been a chasm guarded so religiously betwixt
these two

as for westervelt he was not a whit more warmed by zenobia's passion
than a salamander by the heat of its native furnace he would have
been absolutely statuesque save for a look of slight perplexity
tinctured strongly with derision it was a crisis in which his
intellectual perceptions could not altogether help him out he failed
to comprehend and cared but little for comprehending why zenobia
should put herself into such a fume but satisfied his mind that it was
all folly and only another shape of a woman's manifold absurdity
which men can never understand how many a woman's evil fate has yoked
her with a man like this nature thrusts some of us into the world
miserably incomplete on the emotional side with hardly any
sensibilities except what pertain to us as animals no passion save
of the senses no holy tenderness nor the delicacy that results from
this externally they bear a close resemblance to other men and have
perhaps all save the finest grace but when a woman wrecks herself on
such a being she ultimately finds that the real womanhood within her
has no corresponding part in him her deepest voice lacks a response
the deeper her cry the more dead his silence the fault may be none
of his he cannot give her what never lived within his soul but the
wretchedness on her side and the moral deterioration attendant on a
false and shallow life without strength enough to keep itself sweet
are among the most pitiable wrongs that mortals suffer

now as i looked down from my upper region at this man and
woman outwardly so fair a sight and wandering like two lovers in the
wood i imagined that zenobia at an earlier period of youth might
have fallen into the misfortune above indicated and when her
passionate womanhood as was inevitable had discovered its mistake
here had ensued the character of eccentricity and defiance which
distinguished the more public portion of her life

seeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far i began to think it the
design of fate to let me into all zenobia's secrets and that therefore
the couple would sit down beneath my tree and carry on a conversation
which would leave me nothing to inquire no doubt however had it so
happened i should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a
listener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes or by
sending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place as if this were one
of the trees of dante's ghostly forest but real life never arranges
itself exactly like a romance in the first place they did not sit
down at all secondly even while they passed beneath the tree
zenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken and westervelt's so cool
and low that i hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on
either side what i seem to remember i yet suspect may have been
patched together by my fancy in brooding over the matter afterwards

why not fling the girl off said westervelt and let her go

she clung to me from the first replied zenobia i neither know nor
care what it is in me that so attaches her but she loves me and i
will not fail her

she will plague you then said he in more ways than one

the poor child exclaimed zenobia she can do me neither good nor
harm how should she

i know not what reply westervelt whispered nor did zenobia's
subsequent exclamation give me any clew except that it evidently
inspired her with horror and disgust

with what kind of a being am i linked cried she if my creator
cares aught for my soul let him release me from this miserable bond

i did not think it weighed so heavily said her companion

nevertheless answered zenobia it will strangle me at last

and then i heard her utter a helpless sort of moan a sound which
struggling out of the heart of a person of her pride and strength
affected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a
thousand shrieks and wails

other mysterious words besides what are above written they spoke
together but i understood no more and even question whether i fairly
understood so much as this by long brooding over our recollections
we subtilize them into something akin to imaginary stuff and hardly
capable of being distinguished from it in a few moments they were
completely beyond ear-shot a breeze stirred after them and awoke the
leafy tongues of the surrounding trees which forthwith began to
babble as if innumerable gossips had all at once got wind of zenobia's
secret but as the breeze grew stronger its voice among the branches
was as if it said hush hush and i resolved that to no mortal
would i disclose what i had heard and though there might be room for
casuistry such i conceive is the most equitable rule in all similar
conjunctures



xiii zenobia's legend

the illustrious society of blithedale though it toiled in downright
earnest for the good of mankind yet not unfrequently illuminated its
laborious life with an afternoon or evening of pastime picnics under
the trees were considerably in vogue and within doors fragmentary
bits of theatrical performance such as single acts of tragedy or
comedy or dramatic proverbs and charades zenobia besides was fond
of giving us readings from shakespeare and often with a depth of
tragic power or breadth of comic effect that made one feel it an
intolerable wrong to the world that she did not at once go upon the
stage tableaux vivants were another of our occasional modes of
amusement in which scarlet shawls old silken robes ruffs velvets
furs and all kinds of miscellaneous trumpery converted our familiar
companions into the people of a pictorial world we had been thus
engaged on the evening after the incident narrated in the last chapter
several splendid works of art either arranged after engravings from
the old masters or original illustrations of scenes in history or
romance had been presented and we were earnestly entreating zenobia
for more

she stood with a meditative air holding a large piece of gauze or
some such ethereal stuff as if considering what picture should next
occupy the frame while at her feet lay a heap of many-colored
garments which her quick fancy and magic skill could so easily convert
into gorgeous draperies for heroes and princesses

i am getting weary of this said she after a moment's thought our
own features and our own figures and airs show a little too
intrusively through all the characters we assume we have so much
familiarity with one another's realities that we cannot remove
ourselves at pleasure into an imaginary sphere let us have no more
pictures to-night but to make you what poor amends i can how would
you like to have me trump up a wild spectral legend on the spur of
the moment

zenobia had the gift of telling a fanciful little story off-hand in a
way that made it greatly more effective than it was usually found to be
when she afterwards elaborated the same production with her pen her
proposal therefore was greeted with acclamation

oh a story a story by all means cried the young girls no
matter how marvellous we will believe it every word and let it be a
ghost story if you please

no not exactly a ghost story answered zenobia but something so
nearly like it that you shall hardly tell the difference and
priscilla stand you before me where i may look at you and get my
inspiration out of your eyes they are very deep and dreamy to-night

i know not whether the following version of her story will retain any
portion of its pristine character but as zenobia told it wildly and
rapidly hesitating at no extravagance and dashing at absurdities
which i am too timorous to repeat giving it the varied emphasis of
her inimitable voice and the pictorial illustration of her mobile
face while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the
thoughts as they came bubbling out of her mind thus narrated and
thus heard the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair i scarcely
knew at the time whether she intended us to laugh or be more
seriously impressed from beginning to end it was undeniable
nonsense but not necessarily the worse for that



the silvery veil

you have heard my dear friends of the veiled lady who grew suddenly
so very famous a few months ago and have you never thought how
remarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish all at
once while her renown was on the increase before the public had grown
weary of her and when the enigma of her character instead of being
solved presented itself more mystically at every exhibition her last
appearance as you know was before a crowded audience the next
evening although the bills had announced her at the corner of every
street in red letters of a gigantic size there was no veiled lady to
be seen now listen to my simple little tale and you shall hear the
very latest incident in the known life if life it may be called
which seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of
one's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane the life of
this shadowy phenomenon

a party of young gentlemen you are to understand were enjoying
themselves one afternoon as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of
doing over a bottle or two of champagne and among other ladies less
mysterious the subject of the veiled lady as was very natural
happened to come up before them for discussion she rose as it were
with the sparkling effervescence of their wine and appeared in a more
airy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they
saw her they repeated to one another between jest and earnest all
the wild stories that were in vogue nor i presume did they hesitate
to add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment
might suggest to heighten the marvellousness of their theme

but what an audacious report was that observed one which pretended
to assert the identity of this strange creature with a young
lady and here he mentioned her name the daughter of one of our
most distinguished families

ah there is more in that story than can well be accounted for
remarked another i have it on good authority that the young lady in
question is invariably out of sight and not to be traced even by her
own family at the hours when the veiled lady is before the public nor
can any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance and
just look at the thing her brother is a young fellow of spirit he
cannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister why
then does he not come forward to defend her character unless he is
conscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse

it is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of
these young gentlemen from his companions so for the sake of a soft
and pretty name such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably
bestow upon our heroes i deem it fit to call him theodore

pshaw exclaimed theodore her brother is no such fool nobody
unless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine can seriously
think of crediting that ridiculous rumor why if my senses did not
play me false which never was the case yet i affirm that i saw that
very lady last evening at the exhibition while this veiled
phenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks what can you say to
that

oh it was a spectral illusion that you saw replied his friends
with a general laugh the veiled lady is quite up to such a thing

however as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against
theodore's downright refutation they went on to speak of other stories
which the wild babble of the town had set afloat some upheld that the
veil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world others and
certainly with more reason considering the sex of the veiled
lady that the face was the most hideous and horrible and that this
was her sole motive for hiding it it was the face of a corpse it was
the head of a skeleton it was a monstrous visage with snaky locks
like medusa's and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead
again it was affirmed that there was no single and unchangeable set of
features beneath the veil but that whosoever should be bold enough to
lift it would behold the features of that person in all the world who
was destined to be his fate perhaps he would be greeted by the tender
smile of the woman whom he loved or quite as probably the deadly
scowl of his bitterest enemy would throw a blight over his life they
quoted moreover this startling explanation of the whole affair that
the magician who exhibited the veiled lady and who by the bye was
the handsomest man in the whole world had bartered his own soul for
seven years possession of a familiar fiend and that the last year of
the contract was wearing towards its close

if it were worth our while i could keep you till an hour beyond
midnight listening to a thousand such absurdities as these but
finally our friend theodore who prided himself upon his common-sense
found the matter getting quite beyond his patience

i offer any wager you like cried he setting down his glass so
forcibly as to break the stem of it that this very evening i find out
the mystery of the veiled lady

young men i am told boggle at nothing over their wine so after a
little more talk a wager of considerable amount was actually laid the
money staked and theodore left to choose his own method of settling
the dispute

how he managed it i know not nor is it of any great importance to this
veracious legend the most natural way to be sure was by bribing the
doorkeeper or possibly he preferred clambering in at the window
but at any rate that very evening while the exhibition was going
forward in the hall theodore contrived to gain admittance into the
private withdrawing-room whither the veiled lady was accustomed to
retire at the close of her performances there he waited listening i
suppose to the stifled hum of the great audience and no doubt he
could distinguish the deep tones of the magician causing the wonders
that he wrought to appear more dark and intricate by his mystic
pretence of an explanation perhaps too in the intervals of the wild
breezy music which accompanied the exhibition he might hear the low
voice of the veiled lady conveying her sibylline responses firm as
theodore's nerves might be and much as he prided himself on his sturdy
perception of realities i should not be surprised if his heart
throbbed at a little more than its ordinary rate

theodore concealed himself behind a screen in due time the
performance was brought to a close and whether the door was softly
opened or whether her bodiless presence came through the wall is more
than i can say but all at once without the young man's knowing how
it happened a veiled figure stood in the centre of the room it was
one thing to be in presence of this mystery in the hall of exhibition
where the warm dense life of hundreds of other mortals kept up the
beholder's courage and distributed her influence among so many it was
another thing to be quite alone with her and that too with a
hostile or at least an unauthorized and unjustifiable purpose i
further imagine that theodore now began to be sensible of something
more serious in his enterprise than he had been quite aware of while he
sat with his boon-companions over their sparkling wine

very strange it must be confessed was the movement with which the
figure floated to and fro over the carpet with the silvery veil
covering her from head to foot so impalpable so ethereal so without
substance as the texture seemed yet hiding her every outline in an
impenetrability like that of midnight surely she did not walk she
floated and flitted and hovered about the room no sound of a
footstep no perceptible motion of a limb it was as if a wandering
breeze wafted her before it at its own wild and gentle pleasure but
by and by a purpose began to be discernible throughout the seeming
vagueness of her unrest she was in quest of something could it be
that a subtile presentiment had informed her of the young man's
presence and if so did the veiled lady seek or did she shun him
the doubt in theodore's mind was speedily resolved for after a moment
or two of these erratic flutterings she advanced more decidedly and
stood motionless before the screen

thou art here said a soft low voice come forth theodore thus
summoned by his name theodore as a man of courage had no choice he
emerged from his concealment and presented himself before the veiled
lady with the wine-flush it may be quite gone out of his cheeks

what wouldst thou with me she inquired with the same gentle
composure that was in her former utterance

mysterious creature replied theodore i would know who and what you
are

my lips are forbidden to betray the secret said the veiled lady

at whatever risk i must discover it rejoined theodore

then said the mystery there is no way save to lift my veil

and theodore partly recovering his audacity stept forward on the
instant to do as the veiled lady had suggested but she floated
backward to the opposite side of the room as if the young man's breath
had possessed power enough to waft her away

pause one little instant said the soft low voice and learn the
conditions of what thou art so bold to undertake thou canst go hence
and think of me no more or at thy option thou canst lift this
mysterious veil beneath which i am a sad and lonely prisoner in a
bondage which is worse to me than death but before raising it i
entreat thee in all maiden modesty to bend forward and impress a kiss
where my breath stirs the veil and my virgin lips shall come forward
to meet thy lips and from that instant theodore thou shalt be mine
and i thine with never more a veil between us and all the felicity
of earth and of the future world shall be thine and mine together so
much may a maiden say behind the veil if thou shrinkest from this
there is yet another way and what is that asked theodore dost
thou hesitate said the veiled lady to pledge thyself to me by
meeting these lips of mine while the veil yet hides my face has not
thy heart recognized me dost thou come hither not in holy faith nor
with a pure and generous purpose but in scornful scepticism and idle
curiosity still thou mayest lift the veil but from that instant
theodore i am doomed to be thy evil fate nor wilt thou ever taste
another breath of happiness

there was a shade of inexpressible sadness in the utterance of these
last words but theodore whose natural tendency was towards
scepticism felt himself almost injured and insulted by the veiled
lady's proposal that he should pledge himself for life and eternity
to so questionable a creature as herself or even that she should
suggest an inconsequential kiss taking into view the probability that
her face was none of the most bewitching a delightful idea truly
that he should salute the lips of a dead girl or the jaws of a
skeleton or the grinning cavity of a monster's mouth even should she
prove a comely maiden enough in other respects the odds were ten to
one that her teeth were defective a terrible drawback on the
delectableness of a kiss

excuse me fair lady said theodore and i think he nearly burst into
a laugh if i prefer to lift the veil first and for this affair of
the kiss we may decide upon it afterwards

thou hast made thy choice said the sweet sad voice behind the veil
and there seemed a tender but unresentful sense of wrong done to
womanhood by the young man's contemptuous interpretation of her offer
i must not counsel thee to pause although thy fate is still in thine
own hand

grasping at the veil he flung it upward and caught a glimpse of a
pale lovely face beneath just one momentary glimpse and then the
apparition vanished and the silvery veil fluttered slowly down and lay
upon the floor theodore was alone our legend leaves him there his
retribution was to pine forever and ever for another sight of that
dim mournful face which might have been his life-long household
fireside joy to desire and waste life in a feverish quest and never
meet it more

but what in good sooth had become of the veiled lady had all her
existence been comprehended within that mysterious veil and was she
now annihilated or was she a spirit with a heavenly essence but
which might have been tamed down to human bliss had theodore been
brave and true enough to claim her hearken my sweet friends and
hearken dear priscilla and you shall learn the little more that
zenobia can tell you

just at the moment so far as can be ascertained when the veiled lady
vanished a maiden pale and shadowy rose up amid a knot of visionary
people who were seeking for the better life she was so gentle and so
sad a nameless melancholy gave her such hold upon their
sympathies that they never thought of questioning whence she came
she might have heretofore existed or her thin substance might have
been moulded out of air at the very instant when they first beheld her
it was all one to them they took her to their hearts among them was a
lady to whom more than to all the rest this pale mysterious girl
attached herself

but one morning the lady was wandering in the woods and there met her
a figure in an oriental robe with a dark beard and holding in his
hand a silvery veil he motioned her to stay being a woman of some
nerve she did not shriek nor run away nor faint as many ladies
would have been apt to do but stood quietly and bade him speak the
truth was she had seen his face before but had never feared it
although she knew him to be a terrible magician

lady said he with a warning gesture you are in peril peril
she exclaimed and of what nature

there is a certain maiden replied the magician who has come out of
the realm of mystery and made herself your most intimate companion
now the fates have so ordained it that whether by her own will or
no this stranger is your deadliest enemy in love in worldly
fortune in all your pursuit of happiness she is doomed to fling a
blight over your prospects there is but one possibility of thwarting
her disastrous influence

then tell me that one method said the lady

take this veil he answered holding forth the silvery texture it
is a spell it is a powerful enchantment which i wrought for her sake
and beneath which she was once my prisoner throw it at unawares
over the head of this secret foe stamp your foot and cry arise
magician here is the veiled lady and immediately i will rise up
through the earth and seize her and from that moment you are safe

so the lady took the silvery veil which was like woven air or like
some substance airier than nothing and that would float upward and be
lost among the clouds were she once to let it go returning homeward
she found the shadowy girl amid the knot of visionary
transcendentalists who were still seeking for the better life she
was joyous now and had a rose-bloom in her cheeks and was one of the
prettiest creatures and seemed one of the happiest that the world
could show but the lady stole noiselessly behind her and threw the
veil over her head as the slight ethereal texture sank inevitably
down over her figure the poor girl strove to raise it and met her
dear friend's eyes with one glance of mortal terror and deep deep
reproach it could not change her purpose

arise magician she exclaimed stamping her foot upon the earth
here is the veiled lady

at the word up rose the bearded man in the oriental robes the
beautiful the dark magician who had bartered away his soul he threw
his arms around the veiled lady and she was his bond-slave for
evermore


zenobia all this while had been holding the piece of gauze and so
managed it as greatly to increase the dramatic effect of the legend at
those points where the magic veil was to be described arriving at the
catastrophe and uttering the fatal words she flung the gauze over
priscilla's head and for an instant her auditors held their breath
half expecting i verily believe that the magician would start up
through the floor and carry off our poor little friend before our eyes

as for priscilla she stood droopingly in the midst of us making no
attempt to remove the veil

how do you find yourself my love said zenobia lifting a corner of
the gauze and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile ah the
dear little soul why she is really going to faint mr coverdale
mr coverdale pray bring a glass of water

her nerves being none of the strongest priscilla hardly recovered her
equanimity during the rest of the evening this to be sure was a
great pity but nevertheless we thought it a very bright idea of
zenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion



xiv eliot's pulpit

our sundays at blithedale were not ordinarily kept with such rigid
observance as might have befitted the descendants of the pilgrims
whose high enterprise as we sometimes flattered ourselves we had
taken up and were carrying it onward and aloft to a point which they
never dreamed of attaining

on that hallowed day it is true we rested from our labors our oxen
relieved from their week-day yoke roamed at large through the pasture
each yoke-fellow however keeping close beside his mate and
continuing to acknowledge from the force of habit and sluggish
sympathy the union which the taskmaster had imposed for his own hard
ends as for us human yoke-fellows chosen companions of toil whose
hoes had clinked together throughout the week we wandered off in
various directions to enjoy our interval of repose some i believe
went devoutly to the village church others it may be ascended a
city or a country pulpit wearing the clerical robe with so much
dignity that you would scarcely have suspected the yeoman's frock to
have been flung off only since milking-time others took long rambles
among the rustic lanes and by-paths pausing to look at black old
farmhouses with their sloping roofs and at the modern cottage so
like a plaything that it seemed as if real joy or sorrow could have no
scope within and at the more pretending villa with its range of
wooden columns supporting the needless insolence of a great portico
some betook themselves into the wide dusky barn and lay there for
hours together on the odorous hay while the sunstreaks and the shadows
strove together these to make the barn solemn those to make it
cheerful and both were conquerors and the swallows twittered a
cheery anthem flashing into sight or vanishing as they darted to and
fro among the golden rules of sunshine and others went a little way
into the woods and threw themselves on mother earth pillowing their
heads on a heap of moss the green decay of an old log and dropping
asleep the bumblebees and mosquitoes sung and buzzed about their ears
causing the slumberers to twitch and start without awaking

with hollingsworth zenobia priscilla and myself it grew to be a
custom to spend the sabbath afternoon at a certain rock it was known
to us under the name of eliot's pulpit from a tradition that the
venerable apostle eliot had preached there two centuries gone by to
an indian auditory the old pine forest through which the apostle's
voice was wont to sound had fallen an immemorial time ago but the
soil being of the rudest and most broken surface had apparently never
been brought under tillage other growths maple and beech and birch
had succeeded to the primeval trees so that it was still as wild a
tract of woodland as the great-great-great-great grandson of one of
eliot's indians had any such posterity been in existence could have
desired for the site and shelter of his wigwam these after-growths
indeed lose the stately solemnity of the original forest if left in
due neglect however they run into an entanglement of softer wildness
among the rustling leaves of which the sun can scatter cheerfulness as
it never could among the dark-browed pines

the rock itself rose some twenty or thirty feet a shattered granite
bowlder or heap of bowlders with an irregular outline and many
fissures out of which sprang shrubs bushes and even trees as if the
scanty soil within those crevices were sweeter to their roots than any
other earth at the base of the pulpit the broken bowlders inclined
towards each other so as to form a shallow cave within which our
little party had sometimes found protection from a summer shower on
the threshold or just across it grew a tuft of pale columbines in
their season and violets sad and shadowy recluses such as priscilla
was when we first knew her children of the sun who had never seen
their father but dwelt among damp mosses though not akin to them at
the summit the rock was overshadowed by the canopy of a birch-tree
which served as a sounding-board for the pulpit beneath this shade
with my eyes of sense half shut and those of the imagination widely
opened i used to see the holy apostle of the indians with the
sunlight flickering down upon him through the leaves and glorifying
his figure as with the half-perceptible glow of a transfiguration

i the more minutely describe the rock and this little sabbath
solitude because hollingsworth at our solicitation often ascended
eliot's pulpit and not exactly preached but talked to us his few
disciples in a strain that rose and fell as naturally as the wind's
breath among the leaves of the birch-tree no other speech of man has
ever moved me like some of those discourses it seemed most pitiful a
positive calamity to the world that a treasury of golden thoughts
should thus be scattered by the liberal handful down among us three
when a thousand hearers might have been the richer for them and
hollingsworth the richer likewise by the sympathy of multitudes
after speaking much or little as might happen he would descend from
his gray pulpit and generally fling himself at full length on the
ground face downward meanwhile we talked around him on such topics
as were suggested by the discourse

since her interview with westervelt zenobia's continual inequalities
of temper had been rather difficult for her friends to bear on the
first sunday after that incident when hollingsworth had clambered down
from eliot's pulpit she declaimed with great earnestness and passion
nothing short of anger on the injustice which the world did to women
and equally to itself by not allowing them in freedom and honor and
with the fullest welcome their natural utterance in public

it shall not always be so cried she if i live another year i
will lift up my own voice in behalf of woman's wider liberty

she perhaps saw me smile

what matter of ridicule do you find in this miles coverdale
exclaimed zenobia with a flash of anger in her eyes that smile
permit me to say makes me suspicious of a low tone of feeling and
shallow thought it is my belief yes and my prophecy should i die
before it happens that when my sex shall achieve its rights there
will be ten eloquent women where there is now one eloquent man thus
far no woman in the world has ever once spoken out her whole heart and
her whole mind the mistrust and disapproval of the vast bulk of
society throttles us as with two gigantic hands at our throats we
mumble a few weak words and leave a thousand better ones unsaid you
let us write a little it is true on a limited range of subjects but
the pen is not for woman her power is too natural and immediate it
is with the living voice alone that she can compel the world to
recognize the light of her intellect and the depth of her heart

now though i could not well say so to zenobia i had not smiled from
any unworthy estimate of woman or in denial of the claims which she is
beginning to put forth what amused and puzzled me was the fact that
women however intellectually superior so seldom disquiet themselves
about the rights or wrongs of their sex unless their own individual
affections chance to lie in idleness or to be ill at ease they are
not natural reformers but become such by the pressure of exceptional
misfortune i could measure zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity
with which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man

i will give you leave zenobia replied i to fling your utmost
scorn upon me if you ever hear me utter a sentiment unfavorable to the
widest liberty which woman has yet dreamed of i would give her all
she asks and add a great deal more which she will not be the party to
demand but which men if they were generous and wise would grant of
their own free motion for instance i should love dearly for the
next thousand years at least to have all government devolve into the
hands of women i hate to be ruled by my own sex it excites my
jealousy and wounds my pride it is the iron sway of bodily force
which abases us in our compelled submission but how sweet the free
generous courtesy with which i would kneel before a woman-ruler

yes if she were young and beautiful said zenobia laughing but
how if she were sixty and a fright

ah it is you that rate womanhood low said i but let me go on i
have never found it possible to suffer a bearded priest so near my
heart and conscience as to do me any spiritual good i blush at the
very thought oh in the better order of things heaven grant that the
ministry of souls may be left in charge of women the gates of the
blessed city will be thronged with the multitude that enter in when
that day comes the task belongs to woman god meant it for her he
has endowed her with the religious sentiment in its utmost depth and
purity refined from that gross intellectual alloy with which every
masculine theologist save only one who merely veiled himself in
mortal and masculine shape but was in truth divine has been prone
to mingle it i have always envied the catholics their faith in that
sweet sacred virgin mother who stands between them and the deity
intercepting somewhat of his awful splendor but permitting his love to
stream upon the worshipper more intelligibly to human comprehension
through the medium of a woman's tenderness have i not said enough
zenobia

i cannot think that this is true observed priscilla who had been
gazing at me with great disapproving eyes and i am sure i do not
wish it to be true

poor child exclaimed zenobia rather contemptuously she is the
type of womanhood such as man has spent centuries in making it he is
never content unless he can degrade himself by stooping towards what he
loves in denying us our rights he betrays even more blindness to his
own interests than profligate disregard of ours

is this true asked priscilla with simplicity turning to
hollingsworth is it all true that mr coverdale and zenobia have
been saying

no priscilla answered hollingsworth with his customary bluntness
they have neither of them spoken one true word yet

do you despise woman said zenobia

ah hollingsworth that would be most ungrateful

despise her no cried hollingsworth lifting his great shaggy head
and shaking it at us while his eyes glowed almost fiercely she is
the most admirable handiwork of god in her true place and character
her place is at man's side her office that of the sympathizer the
unreserved unquestioning believer the recognition withheld in every
other manner but given in pity through woman's heart lest man
should utterly lose faith in himself the echo of god's own voice
pronouncing it is well done all the separate action of woman is
and ever has been and always shall be false foolish vain
destructive of her own best and holiest qualities void of every good
effect and productive of intolerable mischiefs man is a wretch
without woman but woman is a monster and thank heaven an almost
impossible and hitherto imaginary monster without man as her
acknowledged principal as true as i had once a mother whom i loved
were there any possible prospect of woman's taking the social stand
which some of them poor miserable abortive creatures who only
dream of such things because they have missed woman's peculiar
happiness or because nature made them really neither man nor
woman if there were a chance of their attaining the end which these
petticoated monstrosities have in view i would call upon my own sex to
use its physical force that unmistakable evidence of sovereignty to
scourge them back within their proper bounds but it will not be
needful the heart of time womanhood knows where its own sphere is
and never seeks to stray beyond it

never was mortal blessed if blessing it were with a glance of such
entire acquiescence and unquestioning faith happy in its completeness
as our little priscilla unconsciously bestowed on hollingsworth she
seemed to take the sentiment from his lips into her heart and brood
over it in perfect content the very woman whom he pictured the
gentle parasite the soft reflection of a more powerful existence sat
there at his feet

i looked at zenobia however fully expecting her to resent as i felt
by the indignant ebullition of my own blood that she ought this
outrageous affirmation of what struck me as the intensity of masculine
egotism it centred everything in itself and deprived woman of her
very soul her inexpressible and unfathomable all to make it a mere
incident in the great sum of man hollingsworth had boldly uttered
what he and millions of despots like him really felt without
intending it he had disclosed the wellspring of all these troubled
waters now if ever it surely behooved zenobia to be the champion of
her sex

but to my surprise and indignation too she only looked humbled some
tears sparkled in her eyes but they were wholly of grief not anger

well be it so was all she said i at least have deep cause to
think you right let man be but manly and godlike and woman is only
too ready to become to him what you say

i smiled somewhat bitterly it is true in contemplation of my own
ill-luck how little did these two women care for me who had freely
conceded all their claims and a great deal more out of the fulness of
my heart while hollingsworth by some necromancy of his horrible
injustice seemed to have brought them both to his feet

women almost invariably behave thus thought i what does the fact
mean is it their nature or is it at last the result of ages of
compelled degradation and in either case will it be possible ever
to redeem them

an intuition now appeared to possess all the party that for this
time at least there was no more to be said with one accord we
arose from the ground and made our way through the tangled undergrowth
towards one of those pleasant wood-paths that wound among the
overarching trees some of the branches hung so low as partly to
conceal the figures that went before from those who followed priscilla
had leaped up more lightly than the rest of us and ran along in
advance with as much airy activity of spirit as was typified in the
motion of a bird which chanced to be flitting from tree to tree in
the same direction as herself never did she seem so happy as that
afternoon she skipt and could not help it from very playfulness of
heart

zenobia and hollingsworth went next in close contiguity but not with
arm in arm now just when they had passed the impending bough of a
birch-tree i plainly saw zenobia take the hand of hollingsworth in
both her own press it to her bosom and let it fall again

the gesture was sudden and full of passion the impulse had evidently
taken her by surprise it expressed all had zenobia knelt before him
or flung herself upon his breast and gasped out i love you
hollingsworth i could not have been more certain of what it meant
they then walked onward as before but methought as the declining
sun threw zenobia's magnified shadow along the path i beheld it
tremulous and the delicate stem of the flower which she wore in her
hair was likewise responsive to her agitation

priscilla through the medium of her eyes at least could not possibly
have been aware of the gesture above described yet at that instant
i saw her droop the buoyancy which just before had been so
bird-like was utterly departed the life seemed to pass out of her
and even the substance of her figure to grow thin and gray i almost
imagined her a shadow tiding gradually into the dimness of the wood
her pace became so slow that hollingsworth and zenobia passed by and
i without hastening my footsteps overtook her

come priscilla said i looking her intently in the face which was
very pale and sorrowful we must make haste after our friends do you
feel suddenly ill a moment ago you flitted along so lightly that i
was comparing you to a bird now on the contrary it is as if you had
a heavy heart and a very little strength to bear it with pray take my
arm

no said priscilla i do not think it would help me it is my
heart as you say that makes me heavy and i know not why just now
i felt very happy

no doubt it was a kind of sacrilege in me to attempt to come within her
maidenly mystery but as she appeared to be tossed aside by her other
friends or carelessly let fall like a flower which they had done
with i could not resist the impulse to take just one peep beneath her
folded petals

zenobia and yourself are dear friends of late i remarked at
first that first evening when you came to us she did not receive
you quite so warmly as might have been wished

i remember it said priscilla no wonder she hesitated to love me
who was then a stranger to her and a girl of no grace or beauty she
being herself so beautiful

but she loves you now of course suggested i and at this very
instant you feel her to be your dearest friend

why do you ask me that question exclaimed priscilla as if
frightened at the scrutiny into her feelings which i compelled her to
make it somehow puts strange thoughts into my mind but i do love
zenobia dearly if she only loves me half as well i shall be happy

how is it possible to doubt that priscilla i rejoined but
observe how pleasantly and happily zenobia and hollingsworth are
walking together i call it a delightful spectacle it truly rejoices
me that hollingsworth has found so fit and affectionate a friend so
many people in the world mistrust him so many disbelieve and
ridicule while hardly any do him justice or acknowledge him for the
wonderful man he is that it is really a blessed thing for him to have
won the sympathy of such a woman as zenobia any man might be proud of
that any man even if he be as great as hollingsworth might love so
magnificent a woman how very beautiful zenobia is and hollingsworth
knows it too

there may have been some petty malice in what i said generosity is a
very fine thing at a proper time and within due limits but it is an
insufferable bore to see one man engrossing every thought of all the
women and leaving his friend to shiver in outer seclusion without
even the alternative of solacing himself with what the more fortunate
individual has rejected yes it was out of a foolish bitterness of
heart that i had spoken

go on before said priscilla abruptly and with true feminine
imperiousness which heretofore i had never seen her exercise it
pleases me best to loiter along by myself i do not walk so fast as
you

with her hand she made a little gesture of dismissal it provoked me
yet on the whole was the most bewitching thing that priscilla had
ever done i obeyed her and strolled moodily homeward wondering as
i had wondered a thousand times already how hollingsworth meant to
dispose of these two hearts which plainly to my perception and as i
could not but now suppose to his he had engrossed into his own huge
egotism

there was likewise another subject hardly less fruitful of speculation
in what attitude did zenobia present herself to hollingsworth was it
in that of a free woman with no mortgage on her affections nor
claimant to her hand but fully at liberty to surrender both in
exchange for the heart and hand which she apparently expected to
receive but was it a vision that i had witnessed in the wood was
westervelt a goblin were those words of passion and agony which
zenobia had uttered in my hearing a mere stage declamation were they
formed of a material lighter than common air or supposing them to
bear sterling weight was it a perilous and dreadful wrong which she
was meditating towards herself and hollingsworth

arriving nearly at the farmhouse i looked back over the long slope of
pasture land and beheld them standing together in the light of
sunset just on the spot where according to the gossip of the
community they meant to build their cottage priscilla alone and
forgotten was lingering in the shadow of the wood



xv a crisis

thus the summer was passing away a summer of toil of interest of
something that was not pleasure but which went deep into my heart and
there became a rich experience i found myself looking forward to
years if not to a lifetime to be spent on the same system the
community were now beginning to form their permanent plans one of our
purposes was to erect a phalanstery as i think we called it after
fourier but the phraseology of those days is not very fresh in my
remembrance where the great and general family should have its
abiding-place individual members too who made it a point of
religion to preserve the sanctity of an exclusive home were selecting
sites for their cottages by the wood-side or on the breezy swells or
in the sheltered nook of some little valley according as their taste
might lean towards snugness or the picturesque altogether by
projecting our minds outward we had imparted a show of novelty to
existence and contemplated it as hopefully as if the soil beneath our
feet had not been fathom-deep with the dust of deluded generations on
every one of which as on ourselves the world had imposed itself as a
hitherto unwedded bride

hollingsworth and myself had often discussed these prospects it was
easy to perceive however that he spoke with little or no fervor but
either as questioning the fulfilment of our anticipations or at any
rate with a quiet consciousness that it was no personal concern of
his shortly after the scene at eliot's pulpit while he and i were
repairing an old stone fence i amused myself with sallying forward
into the future time

when we come to be old men i said they will call us uncles or
fathers father hollingsworth and uncle coverdale and we will look
back cheerfully to these early days and make a romantic story for the
young people and if a little more romantic than truth may warrant it
will be no harm out of our severe trials and hardships in a century
or two we shall every one of us be mythical personages or
exceedingly picturesque and poetical ones at all events they will
have a great public hall in which your portrait and mine and twenty
other faces that are living now shall be hung up and as for me i
will be painted in my shirtsleeves and with the sleeves rolled up to
show my muscular development what stories will be rife among them
about our mighty strength continued i lifting a big stone and
putting it into its place though our posterity will really be far
stronger than ourselves after several generations of a simple
natural and active life what legends of zenobia's beauty and
priscilla's slender and shadowy grace and those mysterious qualities
which make her seem diaphanous with spiritual light in due course of
ages we must all figure heroically in an epic poem and we will
ourselves at least i will bend unseen over the future poet and lend
him inspiration while he writes it

you seem said hollingsworth to be trying how much nonsense you can
pour out in a breath

i wish you would see fit to comprehend retorted i that the
profoundest wisdom must be mingled with nine tenths of nonsense else
it is not worth the breath that utters it but i do long for the
cottages to be built that the creeping plants may begin to run over
them and the moss to gather on the walls and the trees which we will
set out to cover them with a breadth of shadow this spick-and-span
novelty does not quite suit my taste it is time too for children to
be born among us the first-born child is still to come and i shall
never feel as if this were a real practical as well as poetical
system of human life until somebody has sanctified it by death

a pretty occasion for martyrdom truly said hollingsworth

as good as any other i replied i wonder hollingsworth who of
all these strong men and fair women and maidens is doomed the first
to die would it not be well even before we have absolute need of it
to fix upon a spot for a cemetery let us choose the rudest roughest
most uncultivable spot for death's garden ground and death shall
teach us to beautify it grave by grave by our sweet calm way of
dying and the airy elegance out of which we will shape our funeral
rites and the cheerful allegories which we will model into tombstones
the final scene shall lose its terrors so that hereafter it may be
happiness to live and bliss to die none of us must die young yet
should providence ordain it so the event shall not be sorrowful but
affect us with a tender delicious only half-melancholy and almost
smiling pathos

that is to say muttered hollingsworth you will die like a heathen
as you certainly live like one but listen to me coverdale your
fantastic anticipations make me discern all the more forcibly what a
wretched unsubstantial scheme is this on which we have wasted a
precious summer of our lives do you seriously imagine that any such
realities as you and many others here have dreamed of will ever be
brought to pass

certainly i do said i of course when the reality comes it will
wear the every-day commonplace dusty and rather homely garb that
reality always does put on but setting aside the ideal charm i hold
that our highest anticipations have a solid footing on common sense

you only half believe what you say rejoined hollingsworth and as
for me i neither have faith in your dream nor would care the value of
this pebble for its realization were that possible and what more do
you want of it it has given you a theme for poetry let that content
you but now i ask you to be at last a man of sobriety and
earnestness and aid me in an enterprise which is worth all our
strength and the strength of a thousand mightier than we

there can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued
it is enough to say that hollingsworth once more brought forward his
rigid and unconquerable idea a scheme for the reformation of the
wicked by methods moral intellectual and industrial by the sympathy
of pure humble and yet exalted minds and by opening to his pupils
the possibility of a worthier life than that which had become their
fate it appeared unless he overestimated his own means that
hollingsworth held it at his choice and he did so choose to obtain
possession of the very ground on which we had planted our community
and which had not yet been made irrevocably ours by purchase it was
just the foundation that he desired our beginnings might readily be
adapted to his great end the arrangements already completed would
work quietly into his system so plausible looked his theory and more
than that so practical such an air of reasonableness had he by
patient thought thrown over it each segment of it was contrived to
dovetail into all the rest with such a complicated applicability and
so ready was he with a response for every objection that really so
far as logic and argument went he had the matter all his own way

but said i whence can you having no means of your own derive the
enormous capital which is essential to this experiment state street
i imagine would not draw its purser strings very liberally in aid of
such a speculation

i have the funds as much at least as is needed for a
commencement at command he answered they can be produced within a
month if necessary

my thoughts reverted to zenobia it could only be her wealth which
hollingsworth was appropriating so lavishly and on what conditions
was it to be had did she fling it into the scheme with the
uncalculating generosity that characterizes a woman when it is her
impulse to be generous at all and did she fling herself along with
it but hollingsworth did not volunteer an explanation

and have you no regrets i inquired in overthrowing this fair
system of our new life which has been planned so deeply and is now
beginning to flourish so hopefully around us how beautiful it is
and so far as we can yet see how practicable the ages have waited
for us and here we are the very first that have essayed to carry on
our mortal existence in love and mutual help hollingsworth i would
be loath to take the ruin of this enterprise upon my conscience

then let it rest wholly upon mine he answered knitting his black
brows i see through the system it is full of
defects irremediable and damning ones from first to last there is
nothing else i grasp it in my hand and find no substance whatever
there is not human nature in it

why are you so secret in your operations i asked god forbid that
i should accuse you of intentional wrong but the besetting sin of a
philanthropist it appears to me is apt to be a moral obliquity his
sense of honor ceases to be the sense of other honorable men at some
point of his course i know not exactly when or where he is tempted to
palter with the right and can scarcely forbear persuading himself that
the importance of his public ends renders it allowable to throw aside
his private conscience oh my dear friend beware this error if you
meditate the overthrow of this establishment call together our
companions state your design support it with all your eloquence but
allow them an opportunity of defending themselves

it does not suit me said hollingsworth nor is it my duty to do
so

i think it is replied i

hollingsworth frowned not in passion but like fate inexorably

i will not argue the point said he what i desire to know of you
is and you can tell me in one word whether i am to look for your
cooperation in this great scheme of good take it up with me be my
brother in it it offers you what you have told me over and over
again that you most need a purpose in life worthy of the extremest
self-devotion worthy of martyrdom should god so order it in this
view i present it to you you can greatly benefit mankind your
peculiar faculties as i shall direct them are capable of being so
wrought into this enterprise that not one of them need lie idle strike
hands with me and from this moment you shall never again feel the
languor and vague wretchedness of an indolent or half-occupied man
there may be no more aimless beauty in your life but in its stead
there shall be strength courage immitigable will everything that a
manly and generous nature should desire we shall succeed we shall
have done our best for this miserable world and happiness which never
comes but incidentally will come to us unawares

it seemed his intention to say no more but after he had quite broken
off his deep eyes filled with tears and he held out both his hands to
me

coverdale he murmured there is not the man in this wide world whom
i can love as i could you do not forsake me

as i look back upon this scene through the coldness and dimness of so
many years there is still a sensation as if hollingsworth had caught
hold of my heart and were pulling it towards him with an almost
irresistible force it is a mystery to me how i withstood it but in
truth i saw in his scheme of philanthropy nothing but what was odious
a loathsomeness that was to be forever in my daily work a great black
ugliness of sin which he proposed to collect out of a thousand human
hearts and that we should spend our lives in an experiment of
transmuting it into virtue had i but touched his extended hand
hollingsworth's magnetism would perhaps have penetrated me with his own
conception of all these matters but i stood aloof i fortified
myself with doubts whether his strength of purpose had not been too
gigantic for his integrity impelling him to trample on considerations
that should have been paramount to every other

is zenobia to take a part in your enterprise i asked

she is said hollingsworth

she the beautiful the gorgeous i exclaimed and how have you
prevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element

through no base methods as you seem to suspect he answered but by
addressing whatever is best and noblest in her

hollingsworth was looking on the ground but as he often did
so generally indeed in his habitual moods of thought i could not
judge whether it was from any special unwillingness now to meet my
eyes what it was that dictated my next question i cannot precisely
say nevertheless it rose so inevitably into my mouth and as it
were asked itself so involuntarily that there must needs have been an
aptness in it

what is to become of priscilla

hollingsworth looked at me fiercely and with glowing eyes he could
not have shown any other kind of expression than that had he meant to
strike me with a sword

why do you bring in the names of these women said he after a moment
of pregnant silence what have they to do with the proposal which i
make you i must have your answer will you devote yourself and
sacrifice all to this great end and be my friend of friends forever

in heaven's name hollingsworth cried i getting angry and glad to
be angry because so only was it possible to oppose his tremendous
concentrativeness and indomitable will cannot you conceive that a man
may wish well to the world and struggle for its good on some other
plan than precisely that which you have laid down and will you cast
off a friend for no unworthiness but merely because he stands upon his
right as an individual being and looks at matters through his own
optics instead of yours

be with me said hollingsworth or be against me there is no third
choice for you

take this then as my decision i answered i doubt the wisdom of
your scheme furthermore i greatly fear that the methods by which you
allow yourself to pursue it are such as cannot stand the scrutiny of an
unbiassed conscience

and you will not join me

no

i never said the word and certainly can never have it to say
hereafter that cost me a thousandth part so hard an effort as did that
one syllable the heart-pang was not merely figurative but an
absolute torture of the breast i was gazing steadfastly at
hollingsworth it seemed to me that it struck him too like a bullet
a ghastly paleness always so terrific on a swarthy face overspread
his features there was a convulsive movement of his throat as if he
were forcing down some words that struggled and fought for utterance
whether words of anger or words of grief i cannot tell although many
and many a time i have vainly tormented myself with conjecturing which
of the two they were one other appeal to my friendship such as
once already hollingsworth had made taking me in the revulsion that
followed a strenuous exercise of opposing will would completely have
subdued me but he left the matter there well said he

and that was all i should have been thankful for one word more even
had it shot me through the heart as mine did him but he did not
speak it and after a few moments with one accord we set to work
again repairing the stone fence hollingsworth i observed wrought
like a titan and for my own part i lifted stones which at this
day or in a calmer mood at that one i should no more have thought
it possible to stir than to carry off the gates of gaza on my back



xvi leave-takings

a few days after the tragic passage-at-arms between hollingsworth and
me i appeared at the dinner-table actually dressed in a coat instead
of my customary blouse with a satin cravat too a white vest and
several other things that made me seem strange and outlandish to
myself as for my companions this unwonted spectacle caused a great
stir upon the wooden benches that bordered either side of our homely
board

what's in the wind now miles asked one of them are you deserting
us

yes for a week or two said i it strikes me that my health demands
a little relaxation of labor and a short visit to the seaside during
the dog-days

you look like it grumbled silas foster not greatly pleased with the
idea of losing an efficient laborer before the stress of the season was
well over now here's a pretty fellow his shoulders have broadened
a matter of six inches since he came among us he can do his day's
work if he likes with any man or ox on the farm and yet he talks
about going to the seashore for his health well well old woman
added he to his wife let me have a plateful of that pork and cabbage
i begin to feel in a very weakly way when the others have had their
turn you and i will take a jaunt to newport or saratoga


well but mr foster said i you must allow me to take a little
breath

breath retorted the old yeoman your lungs have the play of a pair
of blacksmith's bellows already what on earth do you want more but
go along i understand the business we shall never see your face
here again here ends the reformation of the world so far as miles
coverdale has a hand in it

by no means i replied i am resolute to die in the last ditch for
the good of the cause

die in a ditch muttered gruff silas with genuine yankee intolerance
of any intermission of toil except on sunday the fourth of july the
autumnal cattle-show thanksgiving or the annual fast die in a
ditch i believe in my conscience you would if there were no
steadier means than your own labor to keep you out of it

the truth was that an intolerable discontent and irksomeness had come
over me blithedale was no longer what it had been everything was
suddenly faded the sunburnt and arid aspect of our woods and
pastures beneath the august sky did but imperfectly symbolize the
lack of dew and moisture that since yesterday as it were had
blighted my fields of thought and penetrated to the innermost and
shadiest of my contemplative recesses the change will be recognized
by many who after a period of happiness have endeavored to go on
with the same kind of life in the same scene in spite of the
alteration or withdrawal of some principal circumstance they discover
what heretofore perhaps they had not known that it was this which
gave the bright color and vivid reality to the whole affair

i stood on other terms than before not only with hollingsworth but
with zenobia and priscilla as regarded the two latter it was that
dreamlike and miserable sort of change that denies you the privilege to
complain because you can assert no positive injury nor lay your
finger on anything tangible it is a matter which you do not see but
feel and which when you try to analyze it seems to lose its very
existence and resolve itself into a sickly humor of your own your
understanding possibly may put faith in this denial but your heart
will not so easily rest satisfied it incessantly remonstrates
though most of the time in a bass-note which you do not separately
distinguish but now and then with a sharp cry importunate to be
heard and resolute to claim belief things are not as they were it
keeps saying you shall not impose on me i will never be quiet i
will throb painfully i will be heavy and desolate and shiver with
cold for i your deep heart know when to be miserable as once i
knew when to be happy all is changed for us you are beloved no
more and were my life to be spent over again i would invariably
lend my ear to this cassandra of the inward depths however clamorous
the music and the merriment of a more superficial region

my outbreak with hollingsworth though never definitely known to our
associates had really an effect upon the moral atmosphere of the
community it was incidental to the closeness of relationship into
which we had brought ourselves that an unfriendly state of feeling
could not occur between any two members without the whole society being
more or less commoted and made uncomfortable thereby this species of
nervous sympathy though a pretty characteristic enough sentimentally
considered and apparently betokening an actual bond of love among us
was yet found rather inconvenient in its practical operation mortal
tempers being so infirm and variable as they are if one of us happened
to give his neighbor a box on the ear the tingle was immediately felt
on the same side of everybody's head thus even on the supposition
that we were far less quarrelsome than the rest of the world a great
deal of time was necessarily wasted in rubbing our ears

musing on all these matters i felt an inexpressible longing for at
least a temporary novelty i thought of going across the rocky
mountains or to europe or up the nile of offering myself a volunteer
on the exploring expedition of taking a ramble of years no matter in
what direction and coming back on the other side of the world then
should the colonists of blithedale have established their enterprise on
a permanent basis i might fling aside my pilgrim staff and dusty
shoon and rest as peacefully here as elsewhere or in case
hollingsworth should occupy the ground with his school of reform as he
now purposed i might plead earthly guilt enough by that time to give
me what i was inclined to think the only trustworthy hold on his
affections meanwhile before deciding on any ultimate plan i
determined to remove myself to a little distance and take an exterior
view of what we had all been about

in truth it was dizzy work amid such fermentation of opinions as was
going on in the general brain of the community it was a kind of
bedlam for the time being although out of the very thoughts that were
wildest and most destructive might grow a wisdom holy calm and pure
and that should incarnate itself with the substance of a noble and
happy life but as matters now were i felt myself and having a
decided tendency towards the actual i never liked to feel it getting
quite out of my reckoning with regard to the existing state of the
world i was beginning to lose the sense of what kind of a world it
was among innumerable schemes of what it might or ought to be it was
impossible situated as we were not to imbibe the idea that everything
in nature and human existence was fluid or fast becoming so that the
crust of the earth in many places was broken and its whole surface
portentously upheaving that it was a day of crisis and that we
ourselves were in the critical vortex our great globe floated in the
atmosphere of infinite space like an unsubstantial bubble no
sagacious man will long retain his sagacity if he live exclusively
among reformers and progressive people without periodically returning
into the settled system of things to correct himself by a new
observation from that old standpoint

it was now time for me therefore to go and hold a little talk with
the conservatives the writers of the north american review the
merchants the politicians the cambridge men and all those
respectable old blockheads who still in this intangibility and
mistiness of affairs kept a death-grip on one or two ideas which had
not come into vogue since yesterday morning

the brethren took leave of me with cordial kindness and as for the
sisterhood i had serious thoughts of kissing them all round but
forbore to do so because in all such general salutations the penance
is fully equal to the pleasure so i kissed none of them and nobody
to say the truth seemed to expect it

do you wish me i said to zenobia to announce in town and at the
watering-places your purpose to deliver a course of lectures on the
rights of women

women possess no rights said zenobia with a half-melancholy smile
or at all events only little girls and grandmothers would have the
force to exercise them

she gave me her hand freely and kindly and looked at me i thought
with a pitying expression in her eyes nor was there any settled light
of joy in them on her own behalf but a troubled and passionate flame
flickering and fitful

i regret on the whole that you are leaving us she said and all
the more since i feel that this phase of our life is finished and can
never be lived over again do you know mr coverdale that i have
been several times on the point of making you my confidant for lack of
a better and wiser one but you are too young to be my father
confessor and you would not thank me for treating you like one of
those good little handmaidens who share the bosom secrets of a
tragedy-queen

i would at least be loyal and faithful answered i and would
counsel you with an honest purpose if not wisely

yes said zenobia you would be only too wise too honest honesty
and wisdom are such a delightful pastime at another person's expense

ah zenobia i exclaimed if you would but let me speak

by no means she replied especially when you have just resumed the
whole series of social conventionalisms together with that
strait-bodied coat i would as lief open my heart to a lawyer or a
clergyman no no mr coverdale if i choose a counsellor in the
present aspect of my affairs it must be either an angel or a madman
and i rather apprehend that the latter would be likeliest of the two to
speak the fitting word it needs a wild steersman when we voyage
through chaos the anchor is up farewell

priscilla as soon as dinner was over had betaken herself into a
corner and set to work on a little purse as i approached her she
let her eyes rest on me with a calm serious look for with all her
delicacy of nerves there was a singular self-possession in priscilla
and her sensibilities seemed to lie sheltered from ordinary commotion
like the water in a deep well

will you give me that purse priscilla said i as a parting
keepsake

yes she answered if you will wait till it is finished

i must not wait even for that i replied shall i find you here
on my return

i never wish to go away said she

i have sometimes thought observed i smiling that you priscilla
are a little prophetess or at least that you have spiritual
intimations respecting matters which are dark to us grosser people if
that be the case i should like to ask you what is about to happen for
i am tormented with a strong foreboding that were i to return even so
soon as to-morrow morning i should find everything changed have you
any impressions of this nature

ah no said priscilla looking at me apprehensively if any such
misfortune is coming the shadow has not reached me yet heaven
forbid i should be glad if there might never be any change but one
summer follow another and all just like this

no summer ever came back and no two summers ever were alike said i
with a degree of orphic wisdom that astonished myself times change
and people change and if our hearts do not change as readily so much
the worse for us good-by priscilla

i gave her hand a pressure which i think she neither resisted nor
returned priscilla's heart was deep but of small compass it had
room but for a very few dearest ones among whom she never reckoned me

on the doorstep i met hollingsworth i had a momentary impulse to hold
out my hand or at least to give a parting nod but resisted both
when a real and strong affection has come to an end it is not well to
mock the sacred past with any show of those commonplace civilities that
belong to ordinary intercourse being dead henceforth to him and he
to me there could be no propriety in our chilling one another with the
touch of two corpse-like hands or playing at looks of courtesy with
eyes that were impenetrable beneath the glaze and the film we passed
therefore as if mutually invisible

i can nowise explain what sort of whim prank or perversity it was
that after all these leave-takings induced me to go to the pigsty
and take leave of the swine there they lay buried as deeply among
the straw as they could burrow four huge black grunters the very
symbols of slothful ease and sensual comfort they were asleep
drawing short and heavy breaths which heaved their big sides up and
down unclosing their eyes however at my approach they looked dimly
forth at the outer world and simultaneously uttered a gentle grunt
not putting themselves to the trouble of an additional breath for that
particular purpose but grunting with their ordinary inhalation they
were involved and almost stifled and buried alive in their own
corporeal substance the very unreadiness and oppression wherewith
these greasy citizens gained breath enough to keep their life-machinery
in sluggish movement appeared to make them only the more sensible of
the ponderous and fat satisfaction of their existence peeping at me
an instant out of their small red hardly perceptible eyes they dropt
asleep again yet not so far asleep but that their unctuous bliss was
still present to them betwixt dream and reality

you must come back in season to eat part of a spare-rib said silas
foster giving my hand a mighty squeeze i shall have these fat
fellows hanging up by the heels heads downward pretty soon i tell
you

o cruel silas what a horrible idea cried i all the rest of us
men women and livestock save only these four porkers are bedevilled
with one grief or another they alone are happy and you mean to cut
their throats and eat them it would be more for the general comfort
to let them eat us and bitter and sour morsels we should be



xvii the hotel

arriving in town where my bachelor-rooms long before this time had
received some other occupant i established myself for a day or two
in a certain respectable hotel it was situated somewhat aloof from
my former track in life my present mood inclining me to avoid most of
my old companions from whom i was now sundered by other interests and
who would have been likely enough to amuse themselves at the expense of
the amateur workingman the hotel-keeper put me into a back room of
the third story of his spacious establishment the day was lowering
with occasional gusts of rain and an ugly tempered east wind which
seemed to come right off the chill and melancholy sea hardly mitigated
by sweeping over the roofs and amalgamating itself with the dusky
element of city smoke all the effeminacy of past days had returned
upon me at once summer as it still was i ordered a coal fire in the
rusty grate and was glad to find myself growing a little too warm with
an artificial temperature

my sensations were those of a traveller long sojourning in remote
regions and at length sitting down again amid customs once familiar
there was a newness and an oldness oddly combining themselves into one
impression it made me acutely sensible how strange a piece of
mosaic-work had lately been wrought into my life true if you look at
it in one way it had been only a summer in the country but
considered in a profounder relation it was part of another age a
different state of society a segment of an existence peculiar in its
aims and methods a leaf of some mysterious volume interpolated into
the current history which time was writing off at one moment the
very circumstances now surrounding me my coal fire and the dingy room
in the bustling hotel appeared far off and intangible the next
instant blithedale looked vague as if it were at a distance both in
time and space and so shadowy that a question might be raised whether
the whole affair had been anything more than the thoughts of a
speculative man i had never before experienced a mood that so robbed
the actual world of its solidity it nevertheless involved a charm on
which a devoted epicure of my own emotions i resolved to pause and
enjoy the moral sillabub until quite dissolved away

whatever had been my taste for solitude and natural scenery yet the
thick foggy stifled element of cities the entangled life of many men
together sordid as it was and empty of the beautiful took quite as
strenuous a hold upon my mind i felt as if there could never be
enough of it each characteristic sound was too suggestive to be
passed over unnoticed beneath and around me i heard the stir of the
hotel the loud voices of guests landlord or bar-keeper steps
echoing on the staircase the ringing of a bell announcing arrivals or
departures the porter lumbering past my door with baggage which he
thumped down upon the floors of neighboring chambers the lighter feet
of chambermaids scudding along the passages it is ridiculous to think
what an interest they had for me from the street came the tumult of
the pavements pervading the whole house with a continual uproar so
broad and deep that only an unaccustomed ear would dwell upon it a
company of the city soldiery with a full military band marched in
front of the hotel invisible to me but stirringly audible both by its
foot-tramp and the clangor of its instruments once or twice all the
city bells jangled together announcing a fire which brought out the
engine-men and their machines like an army with its artillery rushing
to battle hour by hour the clocks in many steeples responded one to
another

in some public hall not a great way off there seemed to be an
exhibition of a mechanical diorama for three times during the day
occurred a repetition of obstreperous music winding up with the rattle
of imitative cannon and musketry and a huge final explosion then
ensued the applause of the spectators with clap of hands and thump of
sticks and the energetic pounding of their heels all this was just
as valuable in its way as the sighing of the breeze among the
birch-trees that overshadowed eliot's pulpit

yet i felt a hesitation about plunging into this muddy tide of human
activity and pastime it suited me better for the present to linger
on the brink or hover in the air above it so i spent the first day
and the greater part of the second in the laziest manner possible in
a rocking-chair inhaling the fragrance of a series of cigars with my
legs and slippered feet horizontally disposed and in my hand a novel
purchased of a railroad bibliopolist the gradual waste of my cigar
accomplished itself with an easy and gentle expenditure of breath my
book was of the dullest yet had a sort of sluggish flow like that of
a stream in which your boat is as often aground as afloat had there
been a more impetuous rush a more absorbing passion of the narrative
i should the sooner have struggled out of its uneasy current and have
given myself up to the swell and subsidence of my thoughts but as it
was the torpid life of the book served as an unobtrusive accompaniment
to the life within me and about me at intervals however when its
effect grew a little too soporific not for my patience but for the
possibility of keeping my eyes open i bestirred myself started from
the rocking-chair and looked out of the window

a gray sky the weathercock of a steeple that rose beyond the opposite
range of buildings pointing from the eastward a sprinkle of small
spiteful-looking raindrops on the window-pane in that ebb-tide of my
energies had i thought of venturing abroad these tokens would have
checked the abortive purpose

after several such visits to the window i found myself getting pretty
well acquainted with that little portion of the backside of the
universe which it presented to my view over against the hotel and its
adjacent houses at the distance of forty or fifty yards was the rear
of a range of buildings which appeared to be spacious modern and
calculated for fashionable residences the interval between was
apportioned into grass-plots and here and there an apology for a
garden pertaining severally to these dwellings there were
apple-trees and pear and peach trees too the fruit on which looked
singularly large luxuriant and abundant as well it might in a
situation so warm and sheltered and where the soil had doubtless been
enriched to a more than natural fertility in two or three places
grapevines clambered upon trellises and bore clusters already purple
and promising the richness of malta or madeira in their ripened juice
the blighting winds of our rigid climate could not molest these trees
and vines the sunshine though descending late into this area and too
early intercepted by the height of the surrounding houses yet lay
tropically there even when less than temperate in every other region
dreary as was the day the scene was illuminated by not a few sparrows
and other birds which spread their wings and flitted and fluttered
and alighted now here now there and busily scratched their food out
of the wormy earth most of these winged people seemed to have their
domicile in a robust and healthy buttonwood-tree it aspired upward
high above the roofs of the houses and spread a dense head of foliage
half across the area

there was a cat as there invariably is in such places who evidently
thought herself entitled to the privileges of forest life in this close
heart of city conventionalisms i watched her creeping along the low
flat roofs of the offices descending a flight of wooden steps gliding
among the grass and besieging the buttonwood-tree with murderous
purpose against its feathered citizens but after all they were
birds of city breeding and doubtless knew how to guard themselves
against the peculiar perils of their position

bewitching to my fancy are all those nooks and crannies where nature
like a stray partridge hides her head among the long-established
haunts of men it is likewise to be remarked as a general rule that
there is far more of the picturesque more truth to native and
characteristic tendencies and vastly greater suggestiveness in the
back view of a residence whether in town or country than in its
front the latter is always artificial it is meant for the world's
eye and is therefore a veil and a concealment realities keep in the
rear and put forward an advance guard of show and humbug the
posterior aspect of any old farmhouse behind which a railroad has
unexpectedly been opened is so different from that looking upon the
immemorial highway that the spectator gets new ideas of rural life and
individuality in the puff or two of steam-breath which shoots him past
the premises in a city the distinction between what is offered to
the public and what is kept for the family is certainly not less
striking

but to return to my window at the back of the hotel together with a
due contemplation of the fruit-trees the grapevines the
buttonwood-tree the cat the birds and many other particulars i
failed not to study the row of fashionable dwellings to which all these
appertained here it must be confessed there was a general sameness
from the upper story to the first floor they were so much alike that
i could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one identical
pattern like little wooden toy-people of german manufacture one
long united roof with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain
extended over the whole after the distinctness of separate characters
to which i had recently been accustomed it perplexed and annoyed me
not to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into
well-defined elements it seemed hardly worth while for more than one
of those families to be in existence since they all had the same
glimpse of the sky all looked into the same area all received just
their equal share of sunshine through the front windows and all
listened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they
boarded men are so much alike in their nature that they grow
intolerable unless varied by their circumstances

just about this time a waiter entered my room the truth was i had
rung the bell and ordered a sherry-cobbler


can you tell me i inquired what families reside in any of those
houses opposite

the one right opposite is a rather stylish boarding-house said the
waiter two of the gentlemen boarders keep horses at the stable of
our establishment they do things in very good style sir the people
that live there

i might have found out nearly as much for myself on examining the
house a little more closely in one of the upper chambers i saw a young
man in a dressing-gown standing before the glass and brushing his hair
for a quarter of an hour together he then spent an equal space of
time in the elaborate arrangement of his cravat and finally made his
appearance in a dress-coat which i suspected to be newly come from the
tailor's and now first put on for a dinner-party at a window of the
next story below two children prettily dressed were looking out by
and by a middle-aged gentleman came softly behind them kissed the
little girl and playfully pulled the little boy's ear it was a papa
no doubt just come in from his counting-room or office and anon
appeared mamma stealing as softly behind papa as he had stolen behind
the children and laying her hand on his shoulder to surprise him
then followed a kiss between papa and mamma but a noiseless one for
the children did not turn their heads

i bless god for these good folks thought i to myself i have not
seen a prettier bit of nature in all my summer in the country than
they have shown me here in a rather stylish boarding-house i will
pay them a little more attention by and by

on the first floor an iron balustrade ran along in front of the tall
and spacious windows evidently belonging to a back drawing-room and
far into the interior through the arch of the sliding-doors i could
discern a gleam from the windows of the front apartment there were no
signs of present occupancy in this suite of rooms the curtains being
enveloped in a protective covering which allowed but a small portion
of their crimson material to be seen but two housemaids were
industriously at work so that there was good prospect that the
boarding-house might not long suffer from the absence of its most
expensive and profitable guests meanwhile until they should appear
i cast my eyes downward to the lower regions there in the dusk that
so early settles into such places i saw the red glow of the kitchen
range the hot cook or one of her subordinates with a ladle in her
hand came to draw a cool breath at the back door as soon as she
disappeared an irish man-servant in a white jacket crept slyly
forth and threw away the fragments of a china dish which
unquestionably he had just broken soon afterwards a lady showily
dressed with a curling front of what must have been false hair and
reddish-brown i suppose in hue though my remoteness allowed me only
to guess at such particulars this respectable mistress of the
boarding-house made a momentary transit across the kitchen window and
appeared no more it was her final comprehensive glance in order to
make sure that soup fish and flesh were in a proper state of
readiness before the serving up of dinner

there was nothing else worth noticing about the house unless it be
that on the peak of one of the dormer windows which opened out of the
roof sat a dove looking very dreary and forlorn insomuch that i
wondered why she chose to sit there in the chilly rain while her
kindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote
all at once this dove spread her wings and launching herself in the
air came flying so straight across the intervening space that i fully
expected her to alight directly on my window-sill in the latter part
of her course however she swerved aside flew upward and vanished
as did likewise the slight fantastic pathos with which i had
invested her



xviii the boarding-house

the next day as soon as i thought of looking again towards the
opposite house there sat the dove again on the peak of the same
dormer window it was by no means an early hour for the preceding
evening i had ultimately mustered enterprise enough to visit the
theatre had gone late to bed and slept beyond all limit in my
remoteness from silas foster's awakening horn dreams had tormented me
throughout the night the train of thoughts which for months past
had worn a track through my mind and to escape which was one of my
chief objects in leaving blithedale kept treading remorselessly to and
fro in their old footsteps while slumber left me impotent to regulate
them it was not till i had quitted my three friends that they first
began to encroach upon my dreams in those of the last night
hollingsworth and zenobia standing on either side of my bed had bent
across it to exchange a kiss of passion priscilla beholding
this for she seemed to be peeping in at the chamber window had
melted gradually away and left only the sadness of her expression in
my heart there it still lingered after i awoke one of those
unreasonable sadnesses that you know not how to deal with because it
involves nothing for common-sense to clutch

it was a gray and dripping forenoon gloomy enough in town and still
gloomier in the haunts to which my recollections persisted in
transporting me for in spite of my efforts to think of something
else i thought how the gusty rain was drifting over the slopes and
valleys of our farm how wet must be the foliage that overshadowed the
pulpit rock how cheerless in such a day my hermitage the
tree-solitude of my owl-like humors in the vine-encircled heart of the
tall pine it was a phase of homesickness i had wrenched myself too
suddenly out of an accustomed sphere there was no choice now but to
bear the pang of whatever heartstrings were snapt asunder and that
illusive torment like the ache of a limb long ago cut off by which a
past mode of life prolongs itself into the succeeding one i was full
of idle and shapeless regrets the thought impressed itself upon me
that i had left duties unperformed with the power perhaps to act in
the place of destiny and avert misfortune from my friends i had
resigned them to their fate that cold tendency between instinct and
intellect which made me pry with a speculative interest into people's
passions and impulses appeared to have gone far towards unhumanizing
my heart

but a man cannot always decide for himself whether his own heart is
cold or warm it now impresses me that if i erred at all in regard to
hollingsworth zenobia and priscilla it was through too much
sympathy rather than too little

to escape the irksomeness of these meditations i resumed my post at
the window at first sight there was nothing new to be noticed the
general aspect of affairs was the same as yesterday except that the
more decided inclemency of to-day had driven the sparrows to shelter
and kept the cat within doors whence however she soon emerged
pursued by the cook and with what looked like the better half of a
roast chicken in her mouth the young man in the dress-coat was
invisible the two children in the story below seemed to be romping
about the room under the superintendence of a nursery-maid the
damask curtains of the drawing-room on the first floor were now fully
displayed festooned gracefully from top to bottom of the windows
which extended from the ceiling to the carpet a narrower window at
the left of the drawing-room gave light to what was probably a small
boudoir within which i caught the faintest imaginable glimpse of a
girl's figure in airy drapery her arm was in regular movement as if
she were busy with her german worsted or some other such pretty and
unprofitable handiwork

while intent upon making out this girlish shape i became sensible that
a figure had appeared at one of the windows of the drawing-room there
was a presentiment in my mind or perhaps my first glance imperfect
and sidelong as it was had sufficed to convey subtile information of
the truth at any rate it was with no positive surprise but as if i
had all along expected the incident that directing my eyes
thitherward i beheld like a full-length picture in the space between
the heavy festoons of the window curtains no other than zenobia at
the same instant my thoughts made sure of the identity of the figure
in the boudoir it could only be priscilla

zenobia was attired not in the almost rustic costume which she had
heretofore worn but in a fashionable morning-dress there was
nevertheless one familiar point she had as usual a flower in her
hair brilliant and of a rare variety else it had not been zenobia
after a brief pause at the window she turned away exemplifying in
the few steps that removed her out of sight that noble and beautiful
motion which characterized her as much as any other personal charm not
one woman in a thousand could move so admirably as zenobia many women
can sit gracefully some can stand gracefully and a few perhaps can
assume a series of graceful positions but natural movement is the
result and expression of the whole being and cannot be well and nobly
performed unless responsive to something in the character i often
used to think that music light and airy wild and passionate or the
full harmony of stately marches in accordance with her varying
mood should have attended zenobia's footsteps

i waited for her reappearance it was one peculiarity distinguishing
zenobia from most of her sex that she needed for her moral well-being
and never would forego a large amount of physical exercise at
blithedale no inclemency of sky or muddiness of earth had ever impeded
her daily walks here in town she probably preferred to tread the
extent of the two drawing-rooms and measure out the miles by spaces of
forty feet rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements
accordingly in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of
the sliding-doors to the front window and to return upon her steps
there she stood again between the festoons of the crimson curtains
but another personage was now added to the scene behind zenobia
appeared that face which i had first encountered in the wood-path the
man who had passed side by side with her in such mysterious
familiarity and estrangement beneath my vine curtained hermitage in
the tall pine-tree it was westervelt and though he was looking
closely over her shoulder it still seemed to me as on the former
occasion that zenobia repelled him that perchance they mutually
repelled each other by some incompatibility of their spheres

this impression however might have been altogether the result of
fancy and prejudice in me the distance was so great as to obliterate
any play of feature by which i might otherwise have been made a
partaker of their counsels

there now needed only hollingsworth and old moodie to complete the knot
of characters whom a real intricacy of events greatly assisted by my
method of insulating them from other relations had kept so long upon
my mental stage as actors in a drama in itself perhaps it was no
very remarkable event that they should thus come across me at the
moment when i imagined myself free zenobia as i well knew had
retained an establishment in town and had not unfrequently withdrawn
herself from blithedale during brief intervals on one of which
occasions she had taken priscilla along with her nevertheless there
seemed something fatal in the coincidence that had borne me to this one
spot of all others in a great city and transfixed me there and
compelled me again to waste my already wearied sympathies on affairs
which were none of mine and persons who cared little for me it
irritated my nerves it affected me with a kind of heart-sickness
after the effort which it cost me to fling them off after
consummating my escape as i thought from these goblins of flesh and
blood and pausing to revive myself with a breath or two of an
atmosphere in which they should have no share it was a positive
despair to find the same figures arraying themselves before me and
presenting their old problem in a shape that made it more insoluble
than ever

i began to long for a catastrophe if the noble temper of
hollingsworth's soul were doomed to be utterly corrupted by the too
powerful purpose which had grown out of what was noblest in him if the
rich and generous qualities of zenobia's womanhood might not save her
if priscilla must perish by her tenderness and faith so simple and so
devout then be it so let it all come as for me i would look on
as it seemed my part to do understandingly if my intellect could
fathom the meaning and the moral and at all events reverently and
sadly the curtain fallen i would pass onward with my poor individual
life which was now attenuated of much of its proper substance and
diffused among many alien interests

meanwhile zenobia and her companion had retreated from the window
then followed an interval during which i directed my eves towards the
figure in the boudoir most certainly it was priscilla although
dressed with a novel and fanciful elegance the vague perception of
it as viewed so far off impressed me as if she had suddenly passed
out of a chrysalis state and put forth wings her hands were not now
in motion she had dropt her work and sat with her head thrown back
in the same attitude that i had seen several times before when she
seemed to be listening to an imperfectly distinguished sound

again the two figures in the drawing-room became visible they were
now a little withdrawn from the window face to face and as i could
see by zenobia's emphatic gestures were discussing some subject in
which she at least felt a passionate concern by and by she broke
away and vanished beyond my ken westervelt approached the window
and leaned his forehead against a pane of glass displaying the sort of
smile on his handsome features which when i before met him had let me
into the secret of his gold-bordered teeth every human being when
given over to the devil is sure to have the wizard mark upon him in
one form or another i fancied that this smile with its peculiar
revelation was the devil's signet on the professor

this man as i had soon reason to know was endowed with a cat-like
circumspection and though precisely the most unspiritual quality in
the world it was almost as effective as spiritual insight in making
him acquainted with whatever it suited him to discover he now proved
it considerably to my discomfiture by detecting and recognizing me
at my post of observation perhaps i ought to have blushed at being
caught in such an evident scrutiny of professor westervelt and his
affairs perhaps i did blush be that as it might i retained
presence of mind enough not to make my position yet more irksome by the
poltroonery of drawing back

westervelt looked into the depths of the drawing-room and beckoned
immediately afterwards zenobia appeared at the window with color much
heightened and eyes which as my conscience whispered me were
shooting bright arrows barbed with scorn across the intervening
space directed full at my sensibilities as a gentleman if the truth
must be told far as her flight-shot was those arrows hit the mark
she signified her recognition of me by a gesture with her head and
hand comprising at once a salutation and dismissal the next moment
she administered one of those pitiless rebukes which a woman always has
at hand ready for any offence and which she so seldom spares on due
occasion by letting down a white linen curtain between the festoons
of the damask ones it fell like the drop-curtain of a theatre in the
interval between the acts

priscilla had disappeared from the boudoir but the dove still kept
her desolate perch on the peak of the attic window



xix zenobia's drawing-room

the remainder of the day so far as i was concerned was spent in
meditating on these recent incidents i contrived and alternately
rejected innumerable methods of accounting for the presence of zenobia
and priscilla and the connection of westervelt with both it must be
owned too that i had a keen revengeful sense of the insult inflicted
by zenobia's scornful recognition and more particularly by her letting
down the curtain as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed
between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine for
was mine a mere vulgar curiosity zenobia should have known me better
than to suppose it she should have been able to appreciate that
quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me often against
my own will and to the detriment of my own comfort to live in other
lives and to endeavor by generous sympathies by delicate intuitions
by taking note of things too slight for record and by bringing my
human spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom god
assigned me to learn the secret which was hidden even from themselves

of all possible observers methought a woman like zenobia and a man
like hollingsworth should have selected me and now when the event has
long been past i retain the same opinion of my fitness for the office
true i might have condemned them had i been judge as well as
witness my sentence might have been stern as that of destiny itself
but still no trait of original nobility of character no struggle
against temptation no iron necessity of will on the one hand nor
extenuating circumstance to be derived from passion and despair on the
other no remorse that might coexist with error even if powerless to
prevent it no proud repentance that should claim retribution as a
meed would go unappreciated true again i might give my full
assent to the punishment which was sure to follow but it would be
given mournfully and with undiminished love and after all was
finished i would come as if to gather up the white ashes of those who
had perished at the stake and to tell the world the wrong being now
atoned for how much had perished there which it had never yet known
how to praise

i sat in my rocking-chair too far withdrawn from the window to expose
myself to another rebuke like that already inflicted my eyes still
wandered towards the opposite house but without effecting any new
discoveries late in the afternoon the weathercock on the church
spire indicated a change of wind the sun shone dimly out as if the
golden wine of its beams were mingled half-and-half with water
nevertheless they kindled up the whole range of edifices threw a glow
over the windows glistened on the wet roofs and slowly withdrawing
upward perched upon the chimney-tops thence they took a higher
flight and lingered an instant on the tip of the spire making it the
final point of more cheerful light in the whole sombre scene the next
moment it was all gone the twilight fell into the area like a shower
of dusky snow and before it was quite dark the gong of the hotel
summoned me to tea

when i returned to my chamber the glow of an astral lamp was
penetrating mistily through the white curtain of zenobia's
drawing-room the shadow of a passing figure was now and then cast
upon this medium but with too vague an outline for even my adventurous
conjectures to read the hieroglyphic that it presented

all at once it occurred to me how very absurd was my behavior in thus
tormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as to what was going on within
that drawing-room when it was at my option to be personally present
there my relations with zenobia as yet unchanged as a familiar
friend and associated in the same life-long enterprise gave me the
right and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded to call on
her nothing except our habitual independence of conventional rules
at blithedale could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty
at all events it should now be performed

in compliance with this sudden impulse i soon found myself actually
within the house the rear of which for two days past i had been so
sedulously watching a servant took my card and immediately
returning ushered me upstairs on the way i heard a rich and as it
were triumphant burst of music from a piano in which i felt zenobia's
character although heretofore i had known nothing of her skill upon
the instrument two or three canary-birds excited by this gush of
sound sang piercingly and did their utmost to produce a kindred
melody a bright illumination streamed through the door of the front
drawing-room and i had barely stept across the threshold before
zenobia came forward to meet me laughing and with an extended hand

ah mr coverdale said she still smiling but as i thought with a
good deal of scornful anger underneath it has gratified me to see the
interest which you continue to take in my affairs i have long
recognized you as a sort of transcendental yankee with all the native
propensity of your countrymen to investigate matters that come within
their range but rendered almost poetical in your case by the refined
methods which you adopt for its gratification after all it was an
unjustifiable stroke on my part was it not to let down the window
curtain

i cannot call it a very wise one returned i with a secret
bitterness which no doubt zenobia appreciated it is really
impossible to hide anything in this world to say nothing of the next
all that we ought to ask therefore is that the witnesses of our
conduct and the speculators on our motives should be capable of
taking the highest view which the circumstances of the case may admit
so much being secured i for one would be most happy in feeling
myself followed everywhere by an indefatigable human sympathy

we must trust for intelligent sympathy to our guardian angels if any
there be said zenobia as long as the only spectator of my poor
tragedy is a young man at the window of his hotel i must still claim
the liberty to drop the curtain

while this passed as zenobia's hand was extended i had applied the
very slightest touch of my fingers to her own in spite of an external
freedom her manner made me sensible that we stood upon no real terms
of confidence the thought came sadly across me how great was the
contrast betwixt this interview and our first meeting then in the
warm light of the country fireside zenobia had greeted me cheerily and
hopefully with a full sisterly grasp of the hand conveying as much
kindness in it as other women could have evinced by the pressure of
both arms around my neck or by yielding a cheek to the brotherly
salute the difference was as complete as between her appearance at
that time so simply attired and with only the one superb flower in
her hair and now when her beauty was set off by all that dress and
ornament could do for it and they did much not indeed that they
created or added anything to what nature had lavishly done for zenobia
but those costly robes which she had on those flaming jewels on her
neck served as lamps to display the personal advantages which required
nothing less than such an illumination to be fully seen even her
characteristic flower though it seemed to be still there had
undergone a cold and bright transfiguration it was a flower
exquisitely imitated in jeweller's work and imparting the last touch
that transformed zenobia into a work of art

i scarcely feel i could not forbear saying as if we had ever met
before how many years ago it seems since we last sat beneath eliot's
pulpit with hollingsworth extended on the fallen leaves and priscilla
at his feet can it be zenobia that you ever really numbered
yourself with our little band of earnest thoughtful philanthropic
laborers

those ideas have their time and place she answered coldly but i
fancy it must be a very circumscribed mind that can find room for no
other

her manner bewildered me literally moreover i was dazzled by the
brilliancy of the room a chandelier hung down in the centre glowing
with i know not how many lights there were separate lamps also on
two or three tables and on marble brackets adding their white
radiance to that of the chandelier the furniture was exceedingly
rich fresh from our old farmhouse with its homely board and benches
in the dining-room and a few wicker chairs in the best parlor it
struck me that here was the fulfilment of every fantasy of an
imagination revelling in various methods of costly self-indulgence and
splendid ease pictures marbles vases in brief more shapes of
luxury than there could be any object in enumerating except for an
auctioneer's advertisement and the whole repeated and doubled by the
reflection of a great mirror which showed me zenobia's proud figure
likewise and my own it cost me i acknowledge a bitter sense of
shame to perceive in myself a positive effort to bear up against the
effect which zenobia sought to impose on me i reasoned against her
in my secret mind and strove so to keep my footing in the
gorgeousness with which she had surrounded herself in the redundance
of personal ornament which the largeness of her physical nature and
the rich type of her beauty caused to seem so suitable i malevolently
beheld the true character of the woman passionate luxurious lacking
simplicity not deeply refined incapable of pure and perfect taste
but the next instant she was too powerful for all my opposing
struggles i saw how fit it was that she should make herself as
gorgeous as she pleased and should do a thousand things that would
have been ridiculous in the poor thin weakly characters of other
women to this day however i hardly know whether i then beheld
zenobia in her truest attitude or whether that were the truer one in
which she had presented herself at blithedale in both there was
something like the illusion which a great actress flings around her

have you given up blithedale forever i inquired

why should you think so asked she

i cannot tell answered i except that it appears all like a dream
that we were ever there together

it is not so to me said zenobia i should think it a poor and
meagre nature that is capable of but one set of forms and must convert
all the past into a dream merely because the present happens to be
unlike it why should we be content with our homely life of a few
months past to the exclusion of all other modes it was good but
there are other lives as good or better not you will understand
that i condemn those who give themselves up to it more entirely than i
for myself should deem it wise to do

it irritated me this self-complacent condescending qualified
approval and criticism of a system to which many individuals perhaps
as highly endowed as our gorgeous zenobia had contributed their all of
earthly endeavor and their loftiest aspirations i determined to make
proof if there were any spell that would exorcise her out of the part
which she seemed to be acting she should be compelled to give me a
glimpse of something true some nature some passion no matter whether
right or wrong provided it were real

your allusion to that class of circumscribed characters who can live
only in one mode of life remarked i coolly reminds me of our poor
friend hollingsworth possibly he was in your thoughts when you spoke
thus poor fellow it is a pity that by the fault of a narrow
education he should have so completely immolated himself to that one
idea of his especially as the slightest modicum of common-sense would
teach him its utter impracticability now that i have returned into
the world and can look at his project from a distance it requires
quite all my real regard for this respectable and well-intentioned man
to prevent me laughing at him as i find society at large does

zenobia's eyes darted lightning her cheeks flushed the vividness of
her expression was like the effect of a powerful light flaming up
suddenly within her my experiment had fully succeeded she had shown
me the true flesh and blood of her heart by thus involuntarily
resenting my slight pitying half-kind half-scornful mention of the
man who was all in all with her she herself probably felt this for
it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath and
seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever

i rather imagine said she quietly that your appreciation falls
short of mr hollingsworth's just claims blind enthusiasm absorption
in one idea i grant is generally ridiculous and must be fatal to the
respectability of an ordinary man it requires a very high and powerful
character to make it otherwise but a great man as perhaps you do
not know attains his normal condition only through the inspiration of
one great idea as a friend of mr hollingsworth and at the same
time a calm observer i must tell you that he seems to me such a man
but you are very pardonable for fancying him ridiculous doubtless he
is so to you there can be no truer test of the noble and heroic in
any individual than the degree in which he possesses the faculty of
distinguishing heroism from absurdity

i dared make no retort to zenobia's concluding apothegm in truth i
admired her fidelity it gave me a new sense of hollingsworth's native
power to discover that his influence was no less potent with this
beautiful woman here in the midst of artificial life than it had been
at the foot of the gray rock and among the wild birch-trees of the
wood-path when she so passionately pressed his hand against her heart
the great rude shaggy swarthy man and zenobia loved him

did you bring priscilla with you i resumed do you know i have
sometimes fancied it not quite safe considering the susceptibility of
her temperament that she should be so constantly within the sphere of
a man like hollingsworth such tender and delicate natures among your
sex have often i believe a very adequate appreciation of the heroic
element in men but then again i should suppose them as likely as
any other women to make a reciprocal impression hollingsworth could
hardly give his affections to a person capable of taking an independent
stand but only to one whom he might absorb into himself he has
certainly shown great tenderness for priscilla

zenobia had turned aside but i caught the reflection of her face in
the mirror and saw that it was very pale as pale in her rich
attire as if a shroud were round her

priscilla is here said she her voice a little lower than usual
have not you learnt as much from your chamber window would you like
to see her

she made a step or two into the back drawing-room and
called priscilla dear priscilla



xx they vanish

priscilla immediately answered the summons and made her appearance
through the door of the boudoir i had conceived the idea which i now
recognized as a very foolish one that zenobia would have taken
measures to debar me from an interview with this girl between whom and
herself there was so utter an opposition of their dearest interests
that on one part or the other a great grief if not likewise a great
wrong seemed a matter of necessity but as priscilla was only a leaf
floating on the dark current of events without influencing them by her
own choice or plan as she probably guessed not whither the stream was
bearing her nor perhaps even felt its inevitable movement there
could be no peril of her communicating to me any intelligence with
regard to zenobia's purposes

on perceiving me she came forward with great quietude of manner and
when i held out my hand her own moved slightly towards it as if
attracted by a feeble degree of magnetism

i am glad to see you my dear priscilla said i still holding her
hand but everything that i meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether
i am awake you especially have always seemed like a figure in a
dream and now more than ever

oh there is substance in these fingers of mine she answered giving
my hand the faintest possible pressure and then taking away her own
why do you call me a dream zenobia is much more like one than i she
is so very very beautiful and i suppose added priscilla as if
thinking aloud everybody sees it as i do

but for my part it was priscilla's beauty not zenobia's of which i
was thinking at that moment she was a person who could be quite
obliterated so far as beauty went by anything unsuitable in her
attire her charm was not positive and material enough to bear up
against a mistaken choice of color for instance or fashion it was
safest in her case to attempt no art of dress for it demanded the
most perfect taste or else the happiest accident in the world to give
her precisely the adornment which she needed she was now dressed in
pure white set off with some kind of a gauzy fabric which as i bring
up her figure in my memory with a faint gleam on her shadowy hair and
her dark eyes bent shyly on mine through all the vanished years seems
to be floating about her like a mist i wondered what zenobia meant by
evolving so much loveliness out of this poor girl it was what few
women could afford to do for as i looked from one to the other the
sheen and splendor of zenobia's presence took nothing from priscilla's
softer spell if it might not rather be thought to add to it

what do you think of her asked zenobia

i could not understand the look of melancholy kindness with which
zenobia regarded her she advanced a step and beckoning priscilla
near her kissed her cheek then with a slight gesture of repulse she
moved to the other side of the room i followed

she is a wonderful creature i said ever since she came among us
i have been dimly sensible of just this charm which you have brought
out but it was never absolutely visible till now she is as lovely
as a flower

well say so if you like answered zenobia you are a poet at
least as poets go nowadays and must be allowed to make an
opera-glass of your imagination when you look at women i wonder in
such arcadian freedom of falling in love as we have lately enjoyed it
never occurred to you to fall in love with priscilla in society
indeed a genuine american never dreams of stepping across the
inappreciable air-line which separates one class from another but
what was rank to the colonists of blithedale

there were other reasons i replied why i should have demonstrated
myself an ass had i fallen in love with priscilla by the bye has
hollingsworth ever seen her in this dress

why do you bring up his name at every turn asked zenobia in an
undertone and with a malign look which wandered from my face to
priscilla's you know not what you do it is dangerous sir believe
me to tamper thus with earnest human passions out of your own mere
idleness and for your sport i will endure it no longer take care
that it does not happen again i warn you

you partly wrong me if not wholly i responded it is an uncertain
sense of some duty to perform that brings my thoughts and therefore
my words continually to that one point

oh this stale excuse of duty said zenobia in a whisper so full of
scorn that it penetrated me like the hiss of a serpent i have often
heard it before from those who sought to interfere with me and i know
precisely what it signifies bigotry self-conceit an insolent
curiosity a meddlesome temper a cold-blooded criticism founded on a
shallow interpretation of half-perceptions a monstrous scepticism in
regard to any conscience or any wisdom except one's own a most
irreverent propensity to thrust providence aside and substitute one's
self in its awful place out of these and other motives as miserable
as these comes your idea of duty but beware sir with all your
fancied acuteness you step blindfold into these affairs for any
mischief that may follow your interference i hold you responsible

it was evident that with but a little further provocation the lioness
would turn to bay if indeed such were not her attitude already i
bowed and not very well knowing what else to do was about to
withdraw but glancing again towards priscilla who had retreated
into a corner there fell upon my heart an intolerable burden of
despondency the purport of which i could not tell but only felt it to
bear reference to her i approached and held out my hand a gesture
however to which she made no response it was always one of her
peculiarities that she seemed to shrink from even the most friendly
touch unless it were zenobia's or hollingsworth's zenobia all this
while stood watching us but with a careless expression as if it
mattered very little what might pass

priscilla i inquired lowering my voice when do you go back to
blithedale

whenever they please to take me said she

did you come away of your own free will i asked

i am blown about like a leaf she replied i never have any free
will

does hollingsworth know that you are here said i

he bade me come answered priscilla

she looked at me i thought with an air of surprise as if the idea
were incomprehensible that she should have taken this step without his
agency

what a gripe this man has laid upon her whole being muttered i
between my teeth

well as zenobia so kindly intimates i have no more business here i
wash my hands of it all on hollingsworth's head be the consequences
priscilla i added aloud i know not that ever we may meet again
farewell

as i spoke the word a carriage had rumbled along the street and stopt
before the house the doorbell rang and steps were immediately
afterwards heard on the staircase zenobia had thrown a shawl over her
dress

mr coverdale said she with cool courtesy you will perhaps excuse
us we have an engagement and are going out

whither i demanded

is not that a little more than you are entitled to inquire said she
with a smile at all events it does not suit me to tell you

the door of the drawing-room opened and westervelt appeared i
observed that he was elaborately dressed as if for some grand
entertainment my dislike for this man was infinite at that moment
it amounted to nothing less than a creeping of the flesh as when
feeling about in a dark place one touches something cold and slimy
and questions what the secret hatefulness may be and still i could
not but acknowledge that for personal beauty for polish of manner
for all that externally befits a gentleman there was hardly another
like him after bowing to zenobia and graciously saluting priscilla
in her corner he recognized me by a slight but courteous inclination

come priscilla said zenobia it is time mr coverdale
good-evening

as priscilla moved slowly forward i met her in the middle of the
drawing-room

priscilla said i in the hearing of them all do you know whither
you are going

i do not know she answered

is it wise to go and is it your choice to go i asked if not i
am your friend and hollingsworth's friend tell me so at once

possibly observed westervelt smiling priscilla sees in me an
older friend than either mr coverdale or mr hollingsworth i shall
willingly leave the matter at her option

while thus speaking he made a gesture of kindly invitation and
priscilla passed me with the gliding movement of a sprite and took
his offered arm he offered the other to zenobia but she turned her
proud and beautiful face upon him with a look which judging from what
i caught of it in profile would undoubtedly have smitten the man dead
had he possessed any heart or had this glance attained to it it
seemed to rebound however from his courteous visage like an arrow
from polished steel they all three descended the stairs and when i
likewise reached the street door the carriage was already rolling away



xxi an old acquaintance

thus excluded from everybody's confidence and attaining no further by
my most earnest study than to an uncertain sense of something hidden
from me it would appear reasonable that i should have flung off all
these alien perplexities obviously my best course was to betake
myself to new scenes here i was only an intruder elsewhere there
might be circumstances in which i could establish a personal interest
and people who would respond with a portion of their sympathies for
so much as i should bestow of mine

nevertheless there occurred to me one other thing to be done
remembering old moodie and his relationship with priscilla i
determined to seek an interview for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as i found
it on all others being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's
haunts i went the next day to the saloon of a certain establishment
about which he often lurked it was a reputable place enough
affording good entertainment in the way of meat drink and fumigation
and there in my young and idle days and nights when i was neither
nice nor wise i had often amused myself with watching the staid humors
and sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me

at my first entrance old moodie was not there the more patiently to
await him i lighted a cigar and establishing myself in a corner took
a quiet and by sympathy a boozy kind of pleasure in the customary
life that was going forward the saloon was fitted up with a good deal
of taste there were pictures on the walls and among them an
oil-painting of a beefsteak with such an admirable show of juicy
tenderness that the beholder sighed to think it merely visionary and
incapable of ever being put upon a gridiron another work of high art
was the lifelike representation of a noble sirloin another the
hindquarters of a deer retaining the hoofs and tawny fur another the
head and shoulders of a salmon and still more exquisitely finished a
brace of canvasback ducks in which the mottled feathers were depicted
with the accuracy of a daguerreotype some very hungry painter i
suppose had wrought these subjects of still-life heightening his
imagination with his appetite and earning it is to be hoped the
privilege of a daily dinner off whichever of his pictorial viands he
liked best

then there was a fine old cheese in which you could almost discern the
mites and some sardines on a small plate very richly done and
looking as if oozy with the oil in which they had been smothered all
these things were so perfectly imitated that you seemed to have the
genuine article before you and yet with an indescribable ideal charm
it took away the grossness from what was fleshiest and fattest and
thus helped the life of man even in its earthliest relations to
appear rich and noble as well as warm cheerful and substantial
there were pictures too of gallant revellers those of the old time
flemish apparently with doublets and slashed sleeves drinking their
wine out of fantastic long-stemmed glasses quaffing joyously
quaffing forever with inaudible laughter and song while the champagne
bubbled immortally against their moustaches or the purple tide of
burgundy ran inexhaustibly down their throats

but in an obscure corner of the saloon there was a little picture
excellently done moreover of a ragged bloated new england toper
stretched out on a bench in the heavy apoplectic sleep of
drunkenness the death-in-life was too well portrayed you smelt the
fumy liquor that had brought on this syncope your only comfort lay in
the forced reflection that real as he looked the poor caitiff was
but imaginary a bit of painted canvass whom no delirium tremens nor
so much as a retributive headache awaited on the morrow

by this time it being past eleven o'clock the two bar-keepers of the
saloon were in pretty constant activity one of these young men had a
rare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails it was a spectacle to
behold how with a tumbler in each hand he tossed the contents from
one to the other never conveying it awry nor spilling the least
drop he compelled the frothy liquor as it seemed to me to spout
forth from one glass and descend into the other in a great parabolic
curve as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit he had a
good forehead with a particularly large development just above the
eyebrows fine intellectual gifts no doubt which he had educated to
this profitable end being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails and
commanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment these cocktails
and other artificial combinations of liquor of which there were at
least a score though mostly i suspect fantastic in their
differences were much in favor with the younger class of customers
who at farthest had only reached the second stage of potatory life
the staunch old soakers on the other hand men who if put on tap
would have yielded a red alcoholic liquor by way of blood usually
confined themselves to plain brandy-and-water gin or west india rum
and oftentimes they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as
to the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink
two or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter
and winking one red eye to the bar-keeper he forthwith produced these
choicest and peculiar cordials which it was a matter of great interest
and favor among their acquaintances to obtain a sip of

agreeably to the yankee habit under whatever circumstances the
deportment of all these good fellows old or young was decorous and
thoroughly correct they grew only the more sober in their cups there
was no confused babble nor boisterous laughter they sucked in the
joyous fire of the decanters and kept it smouldering in their inmost
recesses with a bliss known only to the heart which it warmed and
comforted their eyes twinkled a little to be sure they hemmed
vigorously after each glass and laid a hand upon the pit of the
stomach as if the pleasant titillation there was what constituted the
tangible part of their enjoyment in that spot unquestionably and
not in the brain was the acme of the whole affair but the true
purpose of their drinking and one that will induce men to drink or do
something equivalent as long as this weary world shall endure was the
renewed youth and vigor the brisk cheerful sense of things present
and to come with which for about a quarter of an hour the dram
permeated their systems and when such quarters of an hour can be
obtained in some mode less baneful to the great sum of a man's
life but nevertheless with a little spice of impropriety to give
it a wild flavor we temperance people may ring out our bells for
victory

the prettiest object in the saloon was a tiny fountain which threw up
its feathery jet through the counter and sparkled down again into an
oval basin or lakelet containing several goldfishes there was a bed
of bright sand at the bottom strewn with coral and rock-work and the
fishes went gleaming about now turning up the sheen of a golden side
and now vanishing into the shadows of the water like the fanciful
thoughts that coquet with a poet in his dream never before i
imagine did a company of water-drinkers remain so entirely
uncontaminated by the bad example around them nor could i help
wondering that it had not occurred to any freakish inebriate to empty a
glass of liquor into their lakelet what a delightful idea who would
not be a fish if he could inhale jollity with the essential element of
his existence

i had begun to despair of meeting old moodie when all at once i
recognized his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was
set up for the accommodation of bashful topers as a matter of course
he had one of priscilla's little purses and was quietly insinuating it
under the notice of a person who stood near this was always old
moodie's way you hardly ever saw him advancing towards you but
became aware of his proximity without being able to guess how he had
come thither he glided about like a spirit assuming visibility close
to your elbow offering his petty trifles of merchandise remaining
long enough for you to purchase if so disposed and then taking
himself off between two breaths while you happened to be thinking of
something else

by a sort of sympathetic impulse that often controlled me in those more
impressible days of my life i was induced to approach this old man in
a mode as undemonstrative as his own thus when according to his
custom he was probably just about to vanish he found me at his elbow

ah said he with more emphasis than was usual with him it is mr
coverdale

yes mr moodie your old acquaintance answered i it is some time
now since we ate luncheon together at blithedale and a good deal
longer since our little talk together at the street corner

that was a good while ago said the old man

and he seemed inclined to say not a word more his existence looked so
colorless and torpid so very faintly shadowed on the canvas of
reality that i was half afraid lest he should altogether disappear
even while my eyes were fixed full upon his figure he was certainly
the wretchedest old ghost in the world with his crazy hat the dingy
handkerchief about his throat his suit of threadbare gray and
especially that patch over his right eye behind which he always seemed
to be hiding himself there was one method however of bringing him
out into somewhat stronger relief a glass of brandy would effect it
perhaps the gentler influence of a bottle of claret might do the same
nor could i think it a matter for the recording angel to write down
against me if with my painful consciousness of the frost in this old
man's blood and the positive ice that had congealed about his heart i
should thaw him out were it only for an hour with the summer warmth
of a little wine what else could possibly be done for him how else
could he be imbued with energy enough to hope for a happier state
hereafter how else be inspired to say his prayers for there are
states of our spiritual system when the throb of the soul's life is too
faint and weak to render us capable of religious aspiration

mr moodie said i shall we lunch together and would you like to
drink a glass of wine

his one eye gleamed he bowed and it impressed me that he grew to be
more of a man at once either in anticipation of the wine or as a
grateful response to my good fellowship in offering it

with pleasure he replied

the bar-keeper at my request showed us into a private room and soon
afterwards set some fried oysters and a bottle of claret on the table
and i saw the old man glance curiously at the label of the bottle as
if to learn the brand

it should be good wine i remarked if it have any right to its
label

you cannot suppose sir said moodie with a sigh that a poor old
fellow like me knows any difference in wines

and yet in his way of handling the glass in his preliminary snuff at
the aroma in his first cautious sip of the wine and the gustatory
skill with which he gave his palate the full advantage of it it was
impossible not to recognize the connoisseur

i fancy mr moodie said i you are a much better judge of wines
than i have yet learned to be tell me fairly did you never drink it
where the grape grows

how should that have been mr coverdale answered old moodie shyly
but then he took courage as it were and uttered a feeble little
laugh the flavor of this wine added he and its perfume still
more than its taste makes me remember that i was once a young man

i wish mr moodie suggested i not that i greatly cared about it
however but was only anxious to draw him into some talk about
priscilla and zenobia i wish while we sit over our wine you would
favor me with a few of those youthful reminiscences

ah said he shaking his head they might interest you more than you
suppose but i had better be silent mr coverdale if this good
wine though claret i suppose is not apt to play such a trick but
if it should make my tongue run too freely i could never look you in
the face again

you never did look me in the face mr moodie i replied until this
very moment

ah sighed old moodie

it was wonderful however what an effect the mild grape-juice wrought
upon him it was not in the wine but in the associations which it
seemed to bring up instead of the mean slouching furtive painfully
depressed air of an old city vagabond more like a gray kennel-rat than
any other living thing he began to take the aspect of a decayed
gentleman even his garments especially after i had myself quaffed a
glass or two looked less shabby than when we first sat down there
was by and by a certain exuberance and elaborateness of gesture and
manner oddly in contrast with all that i had hitherto seen of him
anon with hardly any impulse from me old moodie began to talk his
communications referred exclusively to a long-past and more fortunate
period of his life with only a few unavoidable allusions to the
circumstances that had reduced him to his present state but having
once got the clew my subsequent researches acquainted me with the main
facts of the following narrative although in writing it out my pen
has perhaps allowed itself a trifle of romantic and legendary license
worthier of a small poet than of a grave biographer



xxii fauntleroy

five-and-twenty years ago at the epoch of this story there dwelt in
one of the middle states a man whom we shall call fauntleroy a man of
wealth and magnificent tastes and prodigal expenditure his home
might almost be styled a palace his habits in the ordinary sense
princely his whole being seemed to have crystallized itself into an
external splendor wherewith he glittered in the eyes of the world and
had no other life than upon this gaudy surface he had married a
lovely woman whose nature was deeper than his own but his affection
for her though it showed largely was superficial like all his other
manifestations and developments he did not so truly keep this noble
creature in his heart as wear her beauty for the most brilliant
ornament of his outward state and there was born to him a child a
beautiful daughter whom he took from the beneficent hand of god with
no just sense of her immortal value but as a man already rich in gems
would receive another jewel if he loved her it was because she shone

after fauntleroy had thus spent a few empty years coruscating
continually an unnatural light the source of it which was merely his
gold began to grow more shallow and finally became exhausted he saw
himself in imminent peril of losing all that had heretofore
distinguished him and conscious of no innate worth to fall back upon
he recoiled from this calamity with the instinct of a soul shrinking
from annihilation to avoid it wretched man or rather to defer it
if but for a month a day or only to procure himself the life of a few
breaths more amid the false glitter which was now less his own than
ever he made himself guilty of a crime it was just the sort of
crime growing out of its artificial state which society unless it
should change its entire constitution for this man's unworthy sake
neither could nor ought to pardon more safely might it pardon murder
fauntleroy's guilt was discovered he fled his wife perished by the
necessity of her innate nobleness in its alliance with a being so
ignoble and betwixt her mother's death and her father's ignominy his
daughter was left worse than orphaned

there was no pursuit after fauntleroy his family connections who had
great wealth made such arrangements with those whom he had attempted
to wrong as secured him from the retribution that would have overtaken
an unfriended criminal the wreck of his estate was divided among his
creditors his name in a very brief space was forgotten by the
multitude who had passed it so diligently from mouth to mouth seldom
indeed was it recalled even by his closest former intimates nor
could it have been otherwise the man had laid no real touch on any
mortal's heart being a mere image an optical delusion created by
the sunshine of prosperity it was his law to vanish into the shadow of
the first intervening cloud he seemed to leave no vacancy a
phenomenon which like many others that attended his brief career went
far to prove the illusiveness of his existence

not however that the physical substance of fauntleroy had literally
melted into vapor he had fled northward to the new england
metropolis and had taken up his abode under another name in a
squalid street or court of the older portion of the city there he
dwelt among poverty-stricken wretches sinners and forlorn good
people irish and whomsoever else were neediest many families were
clustered in each house together above stairs and below in the little
peaked garrets and even in the dusky cellars the house where
fauntleroy paid weekly rent for a chamber and a closet had been a
stately habitation in its day an old colonial governor had built it
and lived there long ago and held his levees in a great room where
now slept twenty irish bedfellows and died in fauntleroy's chamber
which his embroidered and white-wigged ghost still haunted tattered
hangings a marble hearth traversed with many cracks and fissures a
richly carved oaken mantelpiece partly hacked away for kindling-stuff
a stuccoed ceiling defaced with great unsightly patches of the naked
laths such was the chamber's aspect as if with its splinters and
rags of dirty splendor it were a kind of practical gibe at this poor
ruined man of show

at first and at irregular intervals his relatives allowed fauntleroy
a little pittance to sustain life not from any love perhaps but lest
poverty should compel him by new offences to add more shame to that
with which he had already stained them but he showed no tendency to
further guilt his character appeared to have been radically changed
as indeed from its shallowness it well might by his miserable
fate or it may be the traits now seen in him were portions of the
same character presenting itself in another phase instead of any
longer seeking to live in the sight of the world his impulse was to
shrink into the nearest obscurity and to be unseen of men were it
possible even while standing before their eyes he had no pride it
was all trodden in the dust no ostentation for how could it survive
when there was nothing left of fauntleroy save penury and shame his
very gait demonstrated that he would gladly have faded out of view and
have crept about invisibly for the sake of sheltering himself from the
irksomeness of a human glance hardly it was averred within the
memory of those who knew him now had he the hardihood to show his full
front to the world he skulked in corners and crept about in a sort
of noonday twilight making himself gray and misty at all hours with
his morbid intolerance of sunshine

in his torpid despair however he had done an act which that condition
of the spirit seems to prompt almost as often as prosperity and hope
fauntleroy was again married he had taken to wife a forlorn
meek-spirited feeble young woman a seamstress whom he found dwelling
with her mother in a contiguous chamber of the old gubernatorial
residence this poor phantom as the beautiful and noble companion of
his former life had done brought him a daughter and sometimes as from
one dream into another fauntleroy looked forth out of his present
grimy environment into that past magnificence and wondered whether the
grandee of yesterday or the pauper of to-day were real but in my
mind the one and the other were alike impalpable in truth it was
fauntleroy's fatality to behold whatever he touched dissolve after a
few years his second wife dim shadow that she had always been faded
finally out of the world and left fauntleroy to deal as he might with
their pale and nervous child and by this time among his distant
relatives with whom he had grown a weary thought linked with
contagious infamy and which they were only too willing to get rid
of he was himself supposed to be no more

the younger child like his elder one might be considered as the true
offspring of both parents and as the reflection of their state she
was a tremulous little creature shrinking involuntarily from all
mankind but in timidity and no sour repugnance there was a lack of
human substance in her it seemed as if were she to stand up in a
sunbeam it would pass right through her figure and trace out the
cracked and dusty window-panes upon the naked floor but
nevertheless the poor child had a heart and from her mother's gentle
character she had inherited a profound and still capacity of affection
and so her life was one of love she bestowed it partly on her father
but in greater part on an idea

for fauntleroy as they sat by their cheerless fireside which was no
fireside in truth but only a rusty stove had often talked to the
little girl about his former wealth the noble loveliness of his first
wife and the beautiful child whom she had given him instead of the
fairy tales which other parents tell he told priscilla this and out
of the loneliness of her sad little existence priscilla's love grew
and tended upward and twined itself perseveringly around this unseen
sister as a grapevine might strive to clamber out of a gloomy hollow
among the rocks and embrace a young tree standing in the sunny warmth
above it was almost like worship both in its earnestness and its
humility nor was it the less humble though the more earnest because
priscilla could claim human kindred with the being whom she so
devoutly loved as with worship too it gave her soul the refreshment
of a purer atmosphere save for this singular this melancholy and
yet beautiful affection the child could hardly have lived or had she
lived with a heart shrunken for lack of any sentiment to fill it she
must have yielded to the barren miseries of her position and have
grown to womanhood characterless and worthless but now amid all the
sombre coarseness of her father's outward life and of her own
priscilla had a higher and imaginative life within some faint gleam
thereof was often visible upon her face it was as if in her spiritual
visits to her brilliant sister a portion of the latter's brightness
had permeated our dim priscilla and still lingered shedding a faint
illumination through the cheerless chamber after she came back

as the child grew up so pallid and so slender and with much
unaccountable nervousness and all the weaknesses of neglected infancy
still haunting her the gross and simple neighbors whispered strange
things about priscilla the big red irish matrons whose innumerable
progeny swarmed out of the adjacent doors used to mock at the pale
western child they fancied or at least affirmed it between jest
and earnest that she was not so solid flesh and blood as other
children but mixed largely with a thinner element they called her
ghost-child and said that she could indeed vanish when she pleased
but could never in her densest moments make herself quite visible
the sun at midday would shine through her in the first gray of the
twilight she lost all the distinctness of her outline and if you
followed the dim thing into a dark corner behold she was not there
and it was true that priscilla had strange ways strange ways and
stranger words when she uttered any words at all never stirring out
of the old governor's dusky house she sometimes talked of distant
places and splendid rooms as if she had just left them hidden things
were visible to her at least so the people inferred from obscure hints
escaping unawares out of her mouth and silence was audible and in
all the world there was nothing so difficult to be endured by those
who had any dark secret to conceal as the glance of priscilla's timid
and melancholy eyes

her peculiarities were the theme of continual gossip among the other
inhabitants of the gubernatorial mansion the rumor spread thence into
a wider circle those who knew old moodie as he was now called used
often to jeer him at the very street-corners about his daughter's
gift of second-sight and prophecy it was a period when science
though mostly through its empirical professors was bringing forward
anew a hoard of facts and imperfect theories that had partially won
credence in elder times but which modern scepticism had swept away as
rubbish these things were now tossed up again out of the surging
ocean of human thought and experience the story of priscilla's
preternatural manifestations therefore attracted a kind of notice of
which it would have been deemed wholly unworthy a few years earlier
one day a gentleman ascended the creaking staircase and inquired which
was old moodie's chamber door and several times he came again he
was a marvellously handsome man still youthful too and fashionably
dressed except that priscilla in those days had no beauty and in
the languor of her existence had not yet blossomed into womanhood
there would have been rich food for scandal in these visits for the
girl was unquestionably their sole object although her father was
supposed always to be present but it must likewise be added there
was something about priscilla that calumny could not meddle with and
thus far was she privileged either by the preponderance of what was
spiritual or the thin and watery blood that left her cheek so pallid

yet if the busy tongues of the neighborhood spared priscilla in one
way they made themselves amends by renewed and wilder babble on
another score they averred that the strange gentleman was a wizard
and that he had taken advantage of priscilla's lack of earthly
substance to subject her to himself as his familiar spirit through
whose medium he gained cognizance of whatever happened in regions near
or remote the boundaries of his power were defined by the verge of
the pit of tartarus on the one hand and the third sphere of the
celestial world on the other again they declared their suspicion
that the wizard with all his show of manly beauty was really an aged
and wizened figure or else that his semblance of a human body was only
a necromantic or perhaps a mechanical contrivance in which a demon
walked about in proof of it however they could merely instance a
gold band around his upper teeth which had once been visible to
several old women when he smiled at them from the top of the
governor's staircase of course this was all absurdity or mostly so
but after every possible deduction there remained certain very
mysterious points about the stranger's character as well as the
connection that he established with priscilla its nature at that
period was even less understood than now when miracles of this kind
have grown so absolutely stale that i would gladly if the truth
allowed dismiss the whole matter from my narrative

we must now glance backward in quest of the beautiful daughter of
fauntleroy's prosperity what had become of her fauntleroy's only
brother a bachelor and with no other relative so near had adopted
the forsaken child she grew up in affluence with native graces
clustering luxuriantly about her in her triumphant progress towards
womanhood she was adorned with every variety of feminine
accomplishment but she lacked a mother's care with no adequate
control on any hand for a man however stern however wise can never
sway and guide a female child her character was left to shape itself
there was good in it and evil passionate self-willed and
imperious she had a warm and generous nature showing the richness of
the soil however chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it and
choked up the herbs of grace in her girlhood her uncle died as
fauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead and no other heir was
known to exist his wealth devolved on her although dying suddenly
the uncle left no will after his death there were obscure passages in
zenobia's history there were whispers of an attachment and even a
secret marriage with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled
young man the incidents and appearances however which led to this
surmise soon passed away and were forgotten

nor was her reputation seriously affected by the report in fact so
great was her native power and influence and such seemed the careless
purity of her nature that whatever zenobia did was generally
acknowledged as right for her to do the world never criticised her so
harshly as it does most women who transcend its rules it almost
yielded its assent when it beheld her stepping out of the common path
and asserting the more extensive privileges of her sex both
theoretically and by her practice the sphere of ordinary womanhood
was felt to be narrower than her development required

a portion of zenobia's more recent life is told in the foregoing pages
partly in earnest and i imagine as was her disposition half in a
proud jest or in a kind of recklessness that had grown upon her out
of some hidden grief she had given her countenance and promised
liberal pecuniary aid to our experiment of a better social state and
priscilla followed her to blithedale the sole bliss of her life had
been a dream of this beautiful sister who had never so much as known
of her existence by this time too the poor girl was enthralled in
an intolerable bondage from which she must either free herself or
perish she deemed herself safest near zenobia into whose large heart
she hoped to nestle

one evening months after priscilla's departure when moodie or shall
we call him fauntleroy was sitting alone in the state-chamber of the
old governor there came footsteps up the staircase there was a pause
on the landing-place a lady's musical yet haughty accents were heard
making an inquiry from some denizen of the house who had thrust a head
out of a contiguous chamber there was then a knock at moodie's door
come in said he

and zenobia entered the details of the interview that followed being
unknown to me while notwithstanding it would be a pity quite to
lose the picturesqueness of the situation i shall attempt to sketch
it mainly from fancy although with some general grounds of surmise in
regard to the old man's feelings

she gazed wonderingly at the dismal chamber dismal to her who beheld
it only for an instant and how much more so to him into whose brain
each bare spot on the ceiling every tatter of the paper-hangings and
all the splintered carvings of the mantelpiece seen wearily through
long years had worn their several prints inexpressibly miserable is
this familiarity with objects that have been from the first disgustful

i have received a strange message said zenobia after a moment's
silence requesting or rather enjoining it upon me to come hither
rather from curiosity than any other motive and because though a
woman i have not all the timidity of one i have complied can it be
you sir who thus summoned me

it was answered moodie

and what was your purpose she continued you require charity
perhaps in that case the message might have been more fitly worded
but you are old and poor and age and poverty should be allowed their
privileges tell me therefore to what extent you need my aid

put up your purse said the supposed mendicant with an inexplicable
smile keep it keep all your wealth until i demand it all or
none my message had no such end in view you are beautiful they
tell me and i desired to look at you

he took the one lamp that showed the discomfort and sordidness of his
abode and approaching zenobia held it up so as to gain the more
perfect view of her from top to toe so obscure was the chamber that
you could see the reflection of her diamonds thrown upon the dingy
wall and flickering with the rise and fall of zenobia's breath it was
the splendor of those jewels on her neck like lamps that burn before
some fair temple and the jewelled flower in her hair more than the
murky yellow light that helped him to see her beauty but he beheld
it and grew proud at heart his own figure in spite of his mean
habiliments assumed an air of state and grandeur

it is well cried old moodie keep your wealth you are right
worthy of it keep it therefore but with one condition only

zenobia thought the old man beside himself and was moved with pity

have you none to care for you asked she no daughter no
kind-hearted neighbor no means of procuring the attendance which you
need tell me once again can i do nothing for you

nothing he replied i have beheld what i wished now leave me
linger not a moment longer or i may be tempted to say what would bring
a cloud over that queenly brow keep all your wealth but with only
this one condition be kind be no less kind than sisters are to my
poor priscilla

and it may be after zenobia withdrew fauntleroy paced his gloomy
chamber and communed with himself as follows or at all events it
is the only solution which i can offer of the enigma presented in his
character i am unchanged the same man as of yore said he true
my brother's wealth he dying intestate is legally my own i know it
yet of my own choice i live a beggar and go meanly clad and hide
myself behind a forgotten ignominy looks this like ostentation ah
but in zenobia i live again beholding her so beautiful so fit to
be adorned with all imaginable splendor of outward state the cursed
vanity which half a lifetime since dropt off like tatters of once
gaudy apparel from my debased and ruined person is all renewed for her
sake were i to reappear my shame would go with me from darkness into
daylight zenobia has the splendor and not the shame let the world
admire her and be dazzled by her the brilliant child of my
prosperity it is fauntleroy that still shines through her but
then perhaps another thought occurred to him

my poor priscilla and am i just to her in surrendering all to this
beautiful zenobia priscilla i love her best i love her only but
with shame not pride so dim so pallid so shrinking the daughter
of my long calamity wealth were but a mockery in priscilla's hands
what is its use except to fling a golden radiance around those who
grasp it yet let zenobia take heed priscilla shall have no wrong
but while the man of show thus meditated that very evening so far
as i can adjust the dates of these strange incidents priscilla poor
pallid flower was either snatched from zenobia's hand or flung
wilfully away



xxiii a village hall

well i betook myself away and wandered up and down like an exorcised
spirit that had been driven from its old haunts after a mighty
struggle it takes down the solitary pride of man beyond most other
things to find the impracticability of flinging aside affections that
have grown irksome the bands that were silken once are apt to become
iron fetters when we desire to shake them off our souls after all
are not our own we convey a property in them to those with whom we
associate but to what extent can never be known until we feel the
tug the agony of our abortive effort to resume an exclusive sway over
ourselves thus in all the weeks of my absence my thoughts
continually reverted back brooding over the bygone months and
bringing up incidents that seemed hardly to have left a trace of
themselves in their passage i spent painful hours in recalling these
trifles and rendering them more misty and unsubstantial than at first
by the quantity of speculative musing thus kneaded in with them
hollingsworth zenobia priscilla these three had absorbed my life
into themselves together with an inexpressible longing to know their
fortunes there was likewise a morbid resentment of my own pain and a
stubborn reluctance to come again within their sphere

all that i learned of them therefore was comprised in a few brief and
pungent squibs such as the newspapers were then in the habit of
bestowing on our socialist enterprise there was one paragraph which
if i rightly guessed its purport bore reference to zenobia but was too
darkly hinted to convey even thus much of certainty hollingsworth
too with his philanthropic project afforded the penny-a-liners a
theme for some savage and bloody minded jokes and considerably to my
surprise they affected me with as much indignation as if we had still
been friends

thus passed several weeks time long enough for my brown and
toil-hardened hands to reaccustom themselves to gloves old habits
such as were merely external returned upon me with wonderful
promptitude my superficial talk too assumed altogether a worldly
tone meeting former acquaintances who showed themselves inclined to
ridicule my heroic devotion to the cause of human welfare i spoke of
the recent phase of my life as indeed fair matter for a jest but i
also gave them to understand that it was at most only an experiment
on which i had staked no valuable amount of hope or fear it had
enabled me to pass the summer in a novel and agreeable way had
afforded me some grotesque specimens of artificial simplicity and
could not therefore so far as i was concerned be reckoned a failure
in no one instance however did i voluntarily speak of my three
friends they dwelt in a profounder region the more i consider
myself as i then was the more do i recognize how deeply my connection
with those three had affected all my being

as it was already the epoch of annihilated space i might in the time i
was away from blithedale have snatched a glimpse at england and been
back again but my wanderings were confined within a very limited
sphere i hopped and fluttered like a bird with a string about its
leg gyrating round a small circumference and keeping up a restless
activity to no purpose thus it was still in our familiar
massachusetts in one of its white country villages that i must next
particularize an incident

the scene was one of those lyceum halls of which almost every village
has now its own dedicated to that sober and pallid or rather
drab-colored mode of winter-evening entertainment the lecture of
late years this has come strangely into vogue when the natural
tendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral
methods of addressing the public but in halls like this besides the
winter course of lectures there is a rich and varied series of other
exhibitions hither comes the ventriloquist with all his mysterious
tongues the thaumaturgist too with his miraculous transformations of
plates doves and rings his pancakes smoking in your hat and his
cellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle here also
the itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and
gentlemen in physiology and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of
real skeletons and manikins in wax from paris here is to be heard
the choir of ethiopian melodists and to be seen the diorama of moscow
or bunker hill or the moving panorama of the chinese wall here is
displayed the museum of wax figures illustrating the wide catholicism
of earthly renown by mixing up heroes and statesmen the pope and the
mormon prophet kings queens murderers and beautiful ladies every
sort of person in short except authors of whom i never beheld even
the most famous done in wax and here in this many-purposed hall
unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their
share of the puritanism which however diversified with later
patchwork still gives its prevailing tint to new england
character here the company of strolling players sets up its little
stage and claims patronage for the legitimate drama

but on the autumnal evening which i speak of a number of printed
handbills stuck up in the bar-room and on the sign-post of the hotel
and on the meeting-house porch and distributed largely through the
village had promised the inhabitants an interview with that celebrated
and hitherto inexplicable phenomenon the veiled lady

the hall was fitted up with an amphitheatrical descent of seats towards
a platform on which stood a desk two lights a stool and a capacious
antique chair the audience was of a generally decent and respectable
character old farmers in their sunday black coats with shrewd hard
sun-dried faces and a cynical humor oftener than any other
expression in their eyes pretty girls in many-colored attire pretty
young men the schoolmaster the lawyer or student at law the
shop-keeper all looking rather suburban than rural in these days
there is absolutely no rusticity except when the actual labor of the
soil leaves its earth-mould on the person there was likewise a
considerable proportion of young and middle-aged women many of them
stern in feature with marked foreheads and a very definite line of
eyebrow a type of womanhood in which a bold intellectual development
seems to be keeping pace with the progressive delicacy of the physical
constitution of all these people i took note at first according to
my custom but i ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an
individual who sat two or three seats below me immovable apparently
deep in thought with his back of course towards me and his face
turned steadfastly upon the platform

after sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar
contour i was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches
lay my hand on his shoulder put my mouth close to his ear and address
him in a sepulchral melodramatic whisper hollingsworth where have
you left zenobia

his nerves however were proof against my attack he turned half
around and looked me in the face with great sad eyes in which there
was neither kindness nor resentment nor any perceptible surprise

zenobia when i last saw her he answered was at blithedale

he said no more but there was a great deal of talk going on near me
among a knot of people who might be considered as representing the
mysticism or rather the mystic sensuality of this singular age the
nature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably
given the turn to their conversation

i heard from a pale man in blue spectacles some stranger stories than
ever were written in a romance told too with a simple unimaginative
steadfastness which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor
to receive them into the category of established facts he cited
instances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and
passions of another insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow
beneath the influence of a man possessing this potency and the strong
love of years melted away like a vapor at the bidding of one of these
wizards the maiden with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips
would turn from him with icy indifference the newly made widow would
dig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the
sods had taken root upon it a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom
would thrust away her child human character was but soft wax in his
hands and guilt or virtue only the forms into which he should see
fit to mould it the religious sentiment was a flame which he could
blow up with his breath or a spark that he could utterly extinguish
it is unutterable the horror and disgust with which i listened and
saw that if these things were to be believed the individual soul was
virtually annihilated and all that is sweet and pure in our present
life debased and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was
made ridiculous and immortality rendered at once impossible and not
worth acceptance but i would have perished on the spot sooner than
believe it

the epoch of rapping spirits and all the wonders that have followed in
their train such as tables upset by invisible agencies bells
self-tolled at funerals and ghostly music performed on
jew's-harps had not yet arrived alas my countrymen methinks we
have fallen on an evil age if these phenomena have not humbug at the
bottom so much the worse for us what can they indicate in a
spiritual way except that the soul of man is descending to a lower
point than it has ever before reached while incarnate we are pursuing
a downward course in the eternal march and thus bring ourselves into
the same range with beings whom death in requital of their gross and
evil lives has degraded below humanity to hold intercourse with
spirits of this order we must stoop and grovel in some element more
vile than earthly dust these goblins if they exist at all are but
the shadows of past mortality outcasts mere refuse stuff adjudged
unworthy of the eternal world and on the most favorable supposition
dwindling gradually into nothingness the less we have to say to them
the better lest we share their fate

the audience now began to be impatient they signified their desire for
the entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of
boot-heels nor was it a great while longer before in response to
their call there appeared a bearded personage in oriental robes
looking like one of the enchanters of the arabian nights he came upon
the platform from a side door saluted the spectators not with a
salaam but a bow took his station at the desk and first blowing his
nose with a white handkerchief prepared to speak the environment of
the homely village hall and the absence of many ingenious contrivances
of stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off
seemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the
surface no sooner did i behold the bearded enchanter than laying my
hand again on hollingsworth's shoulder i whispered in his ear do you
know him

i never saw the man before he muttered without turning his head

but i had seen him three times already

once on occasion of my first visit to the veiled lady a second time
in the wood-path at blithedale and lastly in zenobia's drawing-room
it was westervelt a quick association of ideas made me shudder from
head to foot and again like an evil spirit bringing up reminiscences
of a man's sins i whispered a question in hollingsworth's ear what
have you done with priscilla

he gave a convulsive start as if i had thrust a knife into him
writhed himself round on his seat glared fiercely into my eyes but
answered not a word

the professor began his discourse explanatory of the psychological
phenomena as he termed them which it was his purpose to exhibit to
the spectators there remains no very distinct impression of it on my
memory it was eloquent ingenious plausible with a delusive show of
spirituality yet really imbued throughout with a cold and dead
materialism i shivered as at a current of chill air issuing out of a
sepulchral vault and bringing the smell of corruption along with it
he spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world an era that
would link soul to soul and the present life to what we call futurity
with a closeness that should finally convert both worlds into one
great mutually conscious brotherhood he described in a strange
philosophical guise with terms of art as if it were a matter of
chemical discovery the agency by which this mighty result was to be
effected nor would it have surprised me had he pretended to hold up a
portion of his universally pervasive fluid as he affirmed it to be in
a glass phial

at the close of his exordium the professor beckoned with his
hand once twice thrice and a figure came gliding upon the
platform enveloped in a long veil of silvery whiteness it fell about
her like the texture of a summer cloud with a kind of vagueness so
that the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately
discerned but the movement of the veiled lady was graceful free and
unembarrassed like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of
thousands or possibly a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with
which this dark earthly magician had surrounded her she was wholly
unconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes

pliant to his gesture which had even an obsequious courtesy but at
the same time a remarkable decisiveness the figure placed itself in
the great chair sitting there in such visible obscurity it was
perhaps as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as
anything that stage trickery could devise the hushed breathing of the
spectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the
wonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible
creature i too was in breathless suspense but with a far different
presentiment of some strange event at hand

you see before you the veiled lady said the bearded professor
advancing to the verge of the platform by the agency of which i have
just spoken she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual
world that silvery veil is in one sense an enchantment having been
dipped as it were and essentially imbued through the potency of my
art with the fluid medium of spirits slight and ethereal as it
seems the limitations of time and space have no existence within its
folds this hall these hundreds of faces encompassing her within so
narrow an amphitheatre are of thinner substance in her view than the
airiest vapor that the clouds are made of she beholds the absolute

as preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological
experiments the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should
endeavor to make the veiled lady sensible of their presence by such
methods provided only no touch were laid upon her person as they
might deem best adapted to that end accordingly several deep-lunged
country fellows who looked as if they might have blown the apparition
away with a breath ascended the platform mutually encouraging one
another they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a
wreath of vanishing mist they smote upon the floor with bludgeons
they perpetrated so hideous a clamor that methought it might have
reached at least a little way into the eternal sphere finally with
the assent of the professor they laid hold of the great chair and
were startled apparently to find it soar upward as if lighter than
the air through which it rose but the veiled lady remained seated and
motionless with a composure that was hardly less than awful because
implying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude
persecutors

these efforts are wholly without avail observed the professor who
had been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference the roar
of a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the veiled lady and yet
were i to will it sitting in this very hall she could hear the desert
wind sweeping over the sands as far off as arabia the icebergs
grinding one against the other in the polar seas the rustle of a leaf
in an east indian forest the lowest whispered breath of the
bashfullest maiden in the world uttering the first confession of her
love nor does there exist the moral inducement apart from my own
behest that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil or arise out
of that chair

greatly to the professor's discomposure however just as he spoke
these words the veiled lady arose there was a mysterious tremor that
shook the magic veil the spectators it may be imagined that she was
about to take flight into that invisible sphere and to the society of
those purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin
hollingsworth a moment ago had mounted the platform and now stood
gazing at the figure with a sad intentness that brought the whole
power of his great stern yet tender soul into his glance

come said he waving his hand towards her you are safe

she threw off the veil and stood before that multitude of people pale
tremulous shrinking as if only then had she discovered that a
thousand eyes were gazing at her poor maiden how strangely had she
been betrayed blazoned abroad as a wonder of the world and
performing what were adjudged as miracles in the faith of many a
seeress and a prophetess in the harsher judgment of others a
mountebank she had kept as i religiously believe her virgin reserve
and sanctity of soul throughout it all within that encircling veil
though an evil hand had flung it over her there was as deep a
seclusion as if this forsaken girl had all the while been sitting
under the shadow of eliot's pulpit in the blithedale woods at the
feet of him who now summoned her to the shelter of his arms and the
true heart-throb of a woman's affection was too powerful for the
jugglery that had hitherto environed her she uttered a shriek and
fled to hollingsworth like one escaping from her deadliest enemy and
was safe forever



xxiv the masqueraders

two nights had passed since the foregoing occurrences when in a
breezy september forenoon i set forth from town on foot towards
blithedale it was the most delightful of all days for a walk with a
dash of invigorating ice-temper in the air but a coolness that soon
gave place to the brisk glow of exercise while the vigor remained as
elastic as before the atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it
each breath was like a sip of ethereal wine tempered as i said with
a crystal lump of ice i had started on this expedition in an
exceedingly sombre mood as well befitted one who found himself tending
towards home but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to
greet him there my feet were hardly off the pavement however when
this morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air
and motion nor had i gone far with fields yet green on either side
before my step became as swift and light as if hollingsworth were
waiting to exchange a friendly hand-grip and zenobia's and priscilla's
open arms would welcome the wanderer's reappearance it has happened
to me on other occasions as well as this to prove how a state of
physical well-being can create a kind of joy in spite of the
profoundest anxiety of mind

the pathway of that walk still runs along with sunny freshness
through my memory i know not why it should be so but my mental eye
can even now discern the september grass bordering the pleasant
roadside with a brighter verdure than while the summer heats were
scorching it the trees too mostly green although here and there a
branch or shrub has donned its vesture of crimson and gold a week or
two before its fellows i see the tufted barberry-bushes with their
small clusters of scarlet fruit the toadstools likewise some
spotlessly white others yellow or red mysterious growths springing
suddenly from no root or seed and growing nobody can tell how or
wherefore in this respect they resembled many of the emotions in my
breast and i still see the little rivulets chill clear and bright
that murmured beneath the road through subterranean rocks and
deepened into mossy pools where tiny fish were darting to and fro and
within which lurked the hermit frog but no i never can account for
it that with a yearning interest to learn the upshot of all my story
and returning to blithedale for that sole purpose i should examine
these things so like a peaceful-bosomed naturalist nor why amid all
my sympathies and fears there shot at times a wild exhilaration
through my frame

thus i pursued my way along the line of the ancient stone wall that
paul dudley built and through white villages and past orchards of
ruddy apples and fields of ripening maize and patches of woodland
and all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest a little beyond
the suburbs of a town hollingsworth zenobia priscilla they glided
mistily before me as i walked sometimes in my solitude i laughed
with the bitterness of self-scorn remembering how unreservedly i had
given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine what had i
ever had to do with them and why being now free should i take this
thraldom on me once again it was both sad and dangerous i whispered
to myself to be in too close affinity with the passions the errors
and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their
own into which if i stept at all it must be as an intruder and at a
peril that i could not estimate

drawing nearer to blithedale a sickness of the spirits kept
alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy i indulged in a
hundred odd and extravagant conjectures either there was no such
place as blithedale nor ever had been nor any brotherhood of
thoughtful laborers like what i seemed to recollect there or else it
was all changed during my absence it had been nothing but dream work
and enchantment i should seek in vain for the old farmhouse and for
the greensward the potato-fields the root-crops and acres of indian
corn and for all that configuration of the land which i had imagined
it would be another spot and an utter strangeness

these vagaries were of the spectral throng so apt to steal out of an
unquiet heart they partly ceased to haunt me on my arriving at a
point whence through the trees i began to catch glimpses of the
blithedale farm that surely was something real there was hardly a
square foot of all those acres on which i had not trodden heavily in
one or another kind of toil the curse of adam's posterity and curse
or blessing be it it gives substance to the life around us had first
come upon me there in the sweat of my brow i had there earned bread
and eaten it and so established my claim to be on earth and my
fellowship with all the sons of labor i could have knelt down and
have laid my breast against that soil the red clay of which my frame
was moulded seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any
other portion of the world's dust there was my home and there might
be my grave

i felt an invincible reluctance nevertheless at the idea of
presenting myself before my old associates without first ascertaining
the state in which they were a nameless foreboding weighed upon me
perhaps should i know all the circumstances that had occurred i might
find it my wisest course to turn back unrecognized unseen and never
look at blithedale more had it been evening i would have stolen
softly to some lighted window of the old farmhouse and peeped darkling
in to see all their well-known faces round the supper-board then
were there a vacant seat i might noiselessly unclose the door glide
in and take my place among them without a word my entrance might be
so quiet my aspect so familiar that they would forget how long i had
been away and suffer me to melt into the scene as a wreath of vapor
melts into a larger cloud i dreaded a boisterous greeting beholding
me at table zenobia as a matter of course would send me a cup of
tea and hollingsworth fill my plate from the great dish of pandowdy
and priscilla in her quiet way would hand the cream and others help
me to the bread and butter being one of them again the knowledge of
what had happened would come to me without a shock for still at
every turn of my shifting fantasies the thought stared me in the face
that some evil thing had befallen us or was ready to befall

yielding to this ominous impression i now turned aside into the woods
resolving to spy out the posture of the community as craftily as the
wild indian before he makes his onset i would go wandering about the
outskirts of the farm and perhaps catching sight of a solitary
acquaintance would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees a
kind of medium fit for spirits departed and revisitant like myself
and entreat him to tell me how all things were

the first living creature that i met was a partridge which sprung up
beneath my feet and whirred away the next was a squirrel who
chattered angrily at me from an overhanging bough i trod along by the
dark sluggish river and remember pausing on the bank above one of
its blackest and most placid pools the very spot with the barkless
stump of a tree aslantwise over the water is depicting itself to my
fancy at this instant and wondering how deep it was and if any
overladen soul had ever flung its weight of mortality in thither and
if it thus escaped the burden or only made it heavier and perhaps the
skeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth
clinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the gripe of its old
despair so slight however was the track of these gloomy ideas that
i soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks which
were floating on the river and anon took flight leaving each a bright
streak over the black surface by and by i came to my hermitage in
the heart of the white-pine tree and clambering up into it sat down
to rest the grapes which i had watched throughout the summer now
dangled around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple
deliciously sweet to the taste and though wild yet free from that
ungentle flavor which distinguishes nearly all our native and
uncultivated grapes methought a wine might be pressed out of them
possessing a passionate zest and endowed with a new kind of
intoxicating quality attended with such bacchanalian ecstasies as the
tamer grapes of madeira france and the rhine are inadequate to
produce and i longed to quaff a great goblet of it that moment

while devouring the grapes i looked on all sides out of the peep-holes
of my hermitage and saw the farmhouse the fields and almost every
part of our domain but not a single human figure in the landscape
some of the windows of the house were open but with no more signs of
life than in a dead man's unshut eyes the barn-door was ajar and
swinging in the breeze the big old dog he was a relic of the former
dynasty of the farm that hardly ever stirred out of the yard was
nowhere to be seen what then had become of all the fraternity and
sisterhood curious to ascertain this point i let myself down out of
the tree and going to the edge of the wood was glad to perceive our
herd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off i fancied by
their manner that two or three of them recognized me as indeed they
ought for i had milked them and been their chamberlain times without
number but after staring me in the face a little while they
phlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again then i grew
foolishly angry at so cold a reception and flung some rotten fragments
of an old stump at these unsentimental cows

skirting farther round the pasture i heard voices and much laughter
proceeding from the interior of the wood voices male and feminine
laughter not only of fresh young throats but the bass of grown
people as if solemn organ-pipes should pour out airs of merriment not
a voice spoke but i knew it better than my own not a laugh but its
cadences were familiar the wood in this portion of it seemed as
full of jollity as if comus and his crew were holding their revels in
one of its usually lonesome glades stealing onward as far as i durst
without hazard of discovery i saw a concourse of strange figures
beneath the overshadowing branches they appeared and vanished and
came again confusedly with the streaks of sunlight glimmering down
upon them

among them was an indian chief with blanket feathers and war-paint
and uplifted tomahawk and near him looking fit to be his woodland
bride the goddess diana with the crescent on her head and attended
by our big lazy dog in lack of any fleeter hound drawing an arrow
from her quiver she let it fly at a venture and hit the very tree
behind which i happened to be lurking another group consisted of a
bavarian broom-girl a negro of the jim crow order one or two
foresters of the middle ages a kentucky woodsman in his trimmed
hunting-shirt and deerskin leggings and a shaker elder quaint
demure broad-brimmed and square-skirted shepherds of arcadia and
allegoric figures from the faerie queen were oddly mixed up with
these arm in arm or otherwise huddled together in strange
discrepancy stood grim puritans gay cavaliers and revolutionary
officers with three-cornered cocked hats and queues longer than their
swords a bright-complexioned dark-haired vivacious little gypsy
with a red shawl over her head went from one group to another telling
fortunes by palmistry and moll pitcher the renowned old witch of
lynn broomstick in hand showed herself prominently in the midst as
if announcing all these apparitions to be the offspring of her
necromantic art but silas foster who leaned against a tree near by
in his customary blue frock and smoking a short pipe did more to
disenchant the scene with his look of shrewd acrid yankee
observation than twenty witches and necromancers could have done in
the way of rendering it weird and fantastic

a little farther off some old-fashioned skinkers and drawers all with
portentously red noses were spreading a banquet on the leaf-strewn
earth while a horned and long-tailed gentleman in whom i recognized
the fiendish musician erst seen by tam o'shanter tuned his fiddle and
summoned the whole motley rout to a dance before partaking of the
festal cheer so they joined hands in a circle whirling round so
swiftly so madly and so merrily in time and tune with the satanic
music that their separate incongruities were blended all together and
they became a kind of entanglement that went nigh to turn one's brain
with merely looking at it anon they stopt all of a sudden and
staring at one another's figures set up a roar of laughter whereat a
shower of the september leaves which all day long had been
hesitating whether to fall or no were shaken off by the movement of
the air and came eddying down upon the revellers

then for lack of breath ensued a silence at the deepest point of
which tickled by the oddity of surprising my grave associates in this
masquerading trim i could not possibly refrain from a burst of
laughter on my own separate account

hush i heard the pretty gypsy fortuneteller say who is that
laughing

some profane intruder said the goddess diana i shall send an
arrow through his heart or change him into a stag as i did actaeon
if he peeps from behind the trees

me take his scalp cried the indian chief brandishing his tomahawk
and cutting a great caper in the air

i'll root him in the earth with a spell that i have at my tongue's
end squeaked moll pitcher and the green moss shall grow all over
him before he gets free again

the voice was miles coverdale's said the fiendish fiddler with a
whisk of his tail and a toss of his horns my music has brought him
hither he is always ready to dance to the devil's tune

thus put on the right track they all recognized the voice at once and
set up a simultaneous shout

miles miles miles coverdale where are you they cried zenobia
queen zenobia here is one of your vassals lurking in the wood
command him to approach and pay his duty

the whole fantastic rabble forthwith streamed off in pursuit of me so
that i was like a mad poet hunted by chimeras having fairly the start
of them however i succeeded in making my escape and soon left their
merriment and riot at a good distance in the rear its fainter tones
assumed a kind of mournfulness and were finally lost in the hush and
solemnity of the wood in my haste i stumbled over a heap of logs and
sticks that had been cut for firewood a great while ago by some
former possessor of the soil and piled up square in order to be
carted or sledded away to the farmhouse but being forgotten they
had lain there perhaps fifty years and possibly much longer until by
the accumulation of moss and the leaves falling over them and
decaying there from autumn to autumn a green mound was formed in
which the softened outline of the woodpile was still perceptible in
the fitful mood that then swayed my mind i found something strangely
affecting in this simple circumstance i imagined the long-dead
woodman and his long-dead wife and children coming out of their chill
graves and essaying to make a fire with this heap of mossy fuel

from this spot i strayed onward quite lost in reverie and neither
knew nor cared whither i was going until a low soft well-remembered
voice spoke at a little distance

there is mr coverdale

miles coverdale said another voice and its tones were very stern
let him come forward then

yes mr coverdale cried a woman's voice clear and melodious but
just then with something unnatural in its chord you are welcome
but you come half an hour too late and have missed a scene which you
would have enjoyed

i looked up and found myself nigh eliot's pulpit at the base of which
sat hollingsworth with priscilla at his feet and zenobia standing
before them



xxv the three together

hollingsworth was in his ordinary working-dress priscilla wore a
pretty and simple gown with a kerchief about her neck and a calash
which she had flung back from her head leaving it suspended by the
strings but zenobia whose part among the maskers as may be
supposed was no inferior one appeared in a costume of fanciful
magnificence with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what
resembled a leafy crown or coronet she represented the oriental
princess by whose name we were accustomed to know her her attitude
was free and noble yet if a queen's it was not that of a queen
triumphant but dethroned on trial for her life or perchance
condemned already the spirit of the conflict seemed nevertheless to
be alive in her her eyes were on fire her cheeks had each a crimson
spot so exceedingly vivid and marked with so definite an outline
that i at first doubted whether it were not artificial in a very
brief space however this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued
as the blood sunk suddenly away zenobia now looked like marble

one always feels the fact in an instant when he has intruded on those
who love or those who hate at some acme of their passion that puts
them into a sphere of their own where no other spirit can pretend to
stand on equal ground with them i was confused affected even with a
species of terror and wished myself away the intenseness of their
feelings gave them the exclusive property of the soil and atmosphere
and left me no right to be or breathe there

hollingsworth zenobia i have just returned to blithedale said i
and had no thought of finding you here we shall meet again at the
house i will retire

this place is free to you answered hollingsworth

as free as to ourselves added zenobia this long while past you
have been following up your game groping for human emotions in the
dark corners of the heart had you been here a little sooner you
might have seen them dragged into the daylight i could even wish to
have my trial over again with you standing by to see fair play do
you know mr coverdale i have been on trial for my life

she laughed while speaking thus but in truth as my eyes wandered
from one of the group to another i saw in hollingsworth all that an
artist could desire for the grim portrait of a puritan magistrate
holding inquest of life and death in a case of witchcraft in zenobia
the sorceress herself not aged wrinkled and decrepit but fair
enough to tempt satan with a force reciprocal to his own and in
priscilla the pale victim whose soul and body had been wasted by her
spells had a pile of fagots been heaped against the rock this hint
of impending doom would have completed the suggestive picture

it was too hard upon me continued zenobia addressing hollingsworth
that judge jury and accuser should all be comprehended in one man
i demur as i think the lawyers say to the jurisdiction but let the
learned judge coverdale seat himself on the top of the rock and you
and me stand at its base side by side pleading our cause before him
there might at least be two criminals instead of one

you forced this on me replied hollingsworth looking her sternly in
the face did i call you hither from among the masqueraders yonder
do i assume to be your judge no except so far as i have an
unquestionable right of judgment in order to settle my own line of
behavior towards those with whom the events of life bring me in
contact true i have already judged you but not on the world's
part neither do i pretend to pass a sentence

ah this is very good cried zenobia with a smile what strange
beings you men are mr coverdale is it not so it is the simplest
thing in the world with you to bring a woman before your secret
tribunals and judge and condemn her unheard and then tell her to go
free without a sentence the misfortune is that this same secret
tribunal chances to be the only judgment-seat that a true woman stands
in awe of and that any verdict short of acquittal is equivalent to a
death sentence

the more i looked at them and the more i heard the stronger grew my
impression that a crisis had just come and gone on hollingsworth's
brow it had left a stamp like that of irrevocable doom of which his
own will was the instrument in zenobia's whole person beholding her
more closely i saw a riotous agitation the almost delirious
disquietude of a great struggle at the close of which the vanquished
one felt her strength and courage still mighty within her and longed
to renew the contest my sensations were as if i had come upon a
battlefield before the smoke was as yet cleared away

and what subjects had been discussed here all no doubt that for so
many months past had kept my heart and my imagination idly feverish
zenobia's whole character and history the true nature of her
mysterious connection with westervelt her later purposes towards
hollingsworth and reciprocally his in reference to her and
finally the degree in which zenobia had been cognizant of the plot
against priscilla and what at last had been the real object of that
scheme on these points as before i was left to my own conjectures
one thing only was certain zenobia and hollingsworth were friends
no longer if their heartstrings were ever intertwined the knot had
been adjudged an entanglement and was now violently broken

but zenobia seemed unable to rest content with the matter in the
posture which it had assumed

ah do we part so exclaimed she seeing hollingsworth about to
retire

and why not said he with almost rude abruptness what is there
further to be said between us

well perhaps nothing answered zenobia looking him in the face and
smiling but we have come many times before to this gray rock and we
have talked very softly among the whisperings of the birch-trees they
were pleasant hours i love to make the latest of them though not
altogether so delightful loiter away as slowly as may be and
besides you have put many queries to me at this which you design to
be our last interview and being driven as i must acknowledge into a
corner i have responded with reasonable frankness but now with your
free consent i desire the privilege of asking a few questions in my
turn

i have no concealments said hollingsworth

we shall see answered zenobia i would first inquire whether you
have supposed me to be wealthy

on that point observed hollingsworth i have had the opinion which
the world holds

and i held it likewise said zenobia had i not heaven is my
witness the knowledge should have been as free to you as me it is
only three days since i knew the strange fact that threatens to make me
poor and your own acquaintance with it i suspect is of at least as
old a date i fancied myself affluent you are aware too of the
disposition which i purposed making of the larger portion of my
imaginary opulence nay were it all i had not hesitated let me ask
you further did i ever propose or intimate any terms of compact on
which depended this as the world would consider it so important
sacrifice

you certainly spoke of none said hollingsworth

nor meant any she responded i was willing to realize your dream
freely generously as some might think but at all events fully
and heedless though it should prove the ruin of my fortune if in your
own thoughts you have imposed any conditions of this expenditure it
is you that must be held responsible for whatever is sordid and
unworthy in them and now one other question do you love this girl

o zenobia exclaimed priscilla shrinking back as if longing for the
rock to topple over and hide her

do you love her repeated zenobia

had you asked me that question a short time since replied
hollingsworth after a pause during which it seemed to me even the
birch-trees held their whispering breath i should have told
you no my feelings for priscilla differed little from those of an
elder brother watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom god has
given him to protect

and what is your answer now persisted zenobia

i do love her said hollingsworth uttering the words with a deep
inward breath instead of speaking them outright as well declare it
thus as in any other way i do love her

now god be judge between us cried zenobia breaking into sudden
passion which of us two has most mortally offended him at least i
am a woman with every fault it may be that a woman ever had weak
vain unprincipled like most of my sex for our virtues when we have
any are merely impulsive and intuitive passionate too and pursuing
my foolish and unattainable ends by indirect and cunning though
absurdly chosen means as an hereditary bond-slave must false
moreover to the whole circle of good in my reckless truth to the
little good i saw before me but still a woman a creature whom only
a little change of earthly fortune a little kinder smile of him who
sent me hither and one true heart to encourage and direct me might
have made all that a woman can be but how is it with you are you a
man no but a monster a cold heartless self-beginning and
self-ending piece of mechanism

with what then do you charge me asked hollingsworth aghast and
greatly disturbed by this attack show me one selfish end in all i
ever aimed at and you may cut it out of my bosom with a knife

it is all self answered zenobia with still intenser bitterness
nothing else nothing but self self self the fiend i doubt not
has made his choicest mirth of you these seven years past and
especially in the mad summer which we have spent together i see it
now i am awake disenchanted disinthralled self self self you
have embodied yourself in a project you are a better masquerader than
the witches and gypsies yonder for your disguise is a self-deception
see whither it has brought you first you aimed a death-blow and a
treacherous one at this scheme of a purer and higher life which so
many noble spirits had wrought out then because coverdale could not
be quite your slave you threw him ruthlessly away and you took me
too into your plan as long as there was hope of my being available
and now fling me aside again a broken tool but foremost and
blackest of your sins you stifled down your inmost consciousness you
did a deadly wrong to your own heart you were ready to sacrifice this
girl whom if god ever visibly showed a purpose he put into your
charge and through whom he was striving to redeem you

this is a woman's view said hollingsworth growing deadly pale a
woman's whose whole sphere of action is in the heart and who can
conceive of no higher nor wider one

be silent cried zenobia imperiously you know neither man nor
woman the utmost that can be said in your behalf and because i would
not be wholly despicable in my own eyes but would fain excuse my
wasted feelings nor own it wholly a delusion therefore i say it is
that a great and rich heart has been ruined in your breast leave me
now you have done with me and i with you farewell

priscilla said hollingsworth come zenobia smiled possibly i
did so too not often in human life has a gnawing sense of injury
found a sweeter morsel of revenge than was conveyed in the tone with
which hollingsworth spoke those two words it was the abased and
tremulous tone of a man whose faith in himself was shaken and who
sought at last to lean on an affection yes the strong man bowed
himself and rested on this poor priscilla oh could she have failed
him what a triumph for the lookers-on

and at first i half imagined that she was about to fail him she
rose up stood shivering like the birch leaves that trembled over her
head and then slowly tottered rather than walked towards zenobia
arriving at her feet she sank down there in the very same attitude
which she had assumed on their first meeting in the kitchen of the old
farmhouse zenobia remembered it

ah priscilla said she shaking her head how much is changed since
then you kneel to a dethroned princess you the victorious one
but he is waiting for you say what you wish and leave me

we are sisters gasped priscilla

i fancied that i understood the word and action it meant the offering
of herself and all she had to be at zenobia's disposal but the
latter would not take it thus

true we are sisters she replied and moved by the sweet word she
stooped down and kissed priscilla but not lovingly for a sense of
fatal harm received through her seemed to be lurking in zenobia's
heart we had one father you knew it from the first i but a
little while else some things that have chanced might have been
spared you but i never wished you harm you stood between me and an
end which i desired i wanted a clear path no matter what i meant
it is over now do you forgive me

o zenobia sobbed priscilla it is i that feel like the guilty one

no no poor little thing said zenobia with a sort of contempt
you have been my evil fate but there never was a babe with less
strength or will to do an injury poor child methinks you have but a
melancholy lot before you sitting all alone in that wide cheerless
heart where for aught you know and as i alas believe the fire
which you have kindled may soon go out ah the thought makes me
shiver for you what will you do priscilla when you find no spark
among the ashes

die she answered

that was well said responded zenobia with an approving smile
there is all a woman in your little compass my poor sister
meanwhile go with him and live

she waved her away with a queenly gesture and turned her own face to
the rock i watched priscilla wondering what judgment she would pass
between zenobia and hollingsworth how interpret his behavior so as to
reconcile it with true faith both towards her sister and herself how
compel her love for him to keep any terms whatever with her sisterly
affection but in truth there was no such difficulty as i imagined
her engrossing love made it all clear hollingsworth could have no
fault that was the one principle at the centre of the universe and
the doubtful guilt or possible integrity of other people appearances
self-evident facts the testimony of her own senses even
hollingsworth's self-accusation had he volunteered it would have
weighed not the value of a mote of thistledown on the other side so
secure was she of his right that she never thought of comparing it
with another's wrong but left the latter to itself

hollingsworth drew her arm within his and soon disappeared with her
among the trees i cannot imagine how zenobia knew when they were out
of sight she never glanced again towards them but retaining a proud
attitude so long as they might have thrown back a retiring look they
were no sooner departed utterly departed than she began slowly to
sink down it was as if a great invisible irresistible weight were
pressing her to the earth settling upon her knees she leaned her
forehead against the rock and sobbed convulsively dry sobs they
seemed to be such as have nothing to do with tears



xxvi zenobia and coverdale

zenobia had entirely forgotten me she fancied herself alone with her
great grief and had it been only a common pity that i felt for
her the pity that her proud nature would have repelled as the one
worst wrong which the world yet held in reserve the sacredness and
awfulness of the crisis might have impelled me to steal away silently
so that not a dry leaf should rustle under my feet i would have left
her to struggle in that solitude with only the eye of god upon her
but so it happened i never once dreamed of questioning my right to be
there now as i had questioned it just before when i came so suddenly
upon hollingsworth and herself in the passion of their recent debate
it suits me not to explain what was the analogy that i saw or imagined
between zenobia's situation and mine nor i believe will the reader
detect this one secret hidden beneath many a revelation which perhaps
concerned me less in simple truth however as zenobia leaned her
forehead against the rock shaken with that tearless agony it seemed
to me that the self-same pang with hardly mitigated torment leaped
thrilling from her heartstrings to my own was it wrong therefore if
i felt myself consecrated to the priesthood by sympathy like this and
called upon to minister to this woman's affliction so far as mortal
could

but indeed what could mortal do for her nothing the attempt would
be a mockery and an anguish time it is true would steal away her
grief and bury it and the best of her heart in the same grave but
destiny itself methought in its kindliest mood could do no better
for zenobia in the way of quick relief than to cause the impending
rock to impend a little farther and fall upon her head so i leaned
against a tree and listened to her sobs in unbroken silence she was
half prostrate half kneeling with her forehead still pressed against
the rock her sobs were the only sound she did not groan nor give
any other utterance to her distress it was all involuntary

at length she sat up put back her hair and stared about her with a
bewildered aspect as if not distinctly recollecting the scene through
which she had passed nor cognizant of the situation in which it left
her her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood
they whitened however by and by and for some time retained this
deathlike hue she put her hand to her forehead with a gesture that
made me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there

her glance wandering wildly to and fro passed over me several times
without appearing to inform her of my presence but finally a look
of recognition gleamed from her eyes into mine

is it you miles coverdale said she smiling ah i perceive what
you are about you are turning this whole affair into a ballad pray
let me hear as many stanzas as you happen to have ready

oh hush zenobia i answered heaven knows what an ache is in my
soul

it is genuine tragedy is it not rejoined zenobia with a sharp
light laugh and you are willing to allow perhaps that i have had
hard measure but it is a woman's doom and i have deserved it like a
woman so let there be no pity as on my part there shall be no
complaint it is all right now or will shortly be so but mr
coverdale by all means write this ballad and put your soul's ache
into it and turn your sympathy to good account as other poets do and
as poets must unless they choose to give us glittering icicles instead
of lines of fire as for the moral it shall be distilled into the
final stanza in a drop of bitter honey

what shall it be zenobia i inquired endeavoring to fall in with
her mood

oh a very old one will serve the purpose she replied there are
no new truths much as we have prided ourselves on finding some a
moral why this that in the battlefield of life the downright
stroke that would fall only on a man's steel headpiece is sure to
light on a woman's heart over which she wears no breastplate and
whose wisdom it is therefore to keep out of the conflict or this
that the whole universe her own sex and yours and providence or
destiny to boot make common cause against the woman who swerves one
hair's-breadth out of the beaten track yes and add for i may as
well own it now that with that one hair's-breadth she goes all
astray and never sees the world in its true aspect afterwards

this last is too stern a moral i observed cannot we soften it a
little

do it if you like at your own peril not on my responsibility she
answered then with a sudden change of subject she went on after
all he has flung away what would have served him better than the poor
pale flower he kept what can priscilla do for him put passionate
warmth into his heart when it shall be chilled with frozen hopes
strengthen his hands when they are weary with much doing and no
performance no but only tend towards him with a blind instinctive
love and hang her little puny weakness for a clog upon his arm she
cannot even give him such sympathy as is worth the name for will he
never in many an hour of darkness need that proud intellectual
sympathy which he might have had from me the sympathy that would
flash light along his course and guide as well as cheer him poor
hollingsworth where will he find it now

hollingsworth has a heart of ice said i bitterly he is a wretch

do him no wrong interrupted zenobia turning haughtily upon me
presume not to estimate a man like hollingsworth it was my fault
all along and none of his i see it now he never sought me why
should he seek me what had i to offer him a miserable bruised and
battered heart spoilt long before he met me a life too hopelessly
entangled with a villain's he did well to cast me off god be
praised he did it and yet had he trusted me and borne with me a
little longer i would have saved him all this trouble

she was silent for a time and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground
again raising them her look was more mild and calm

miles coverdale said she

well zenobia i responded can i do you any service

very little she replied but it is my purpose as you may well
imagine to remove from blithedale and most likely i may not see
hollingsworth again a woman in my position you understand feels
scarcely at her ease among former friends new faces unaccustomed
looks those only can she tolerate she would pine among familiar
scenes she would be apt to blush too under the eyes that knew her
secret her heart might throb uncomfortably she would mortify herself
i suppose with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her
sex at the foot of proud contumacious man poor womanhood with its
rights and wrongs here will be new matter for my course of lectures
at the idea of which you smiled mr coverdale a month or two ago
but as you have really a heart and sympathies as far as they go and
as i shall depart without seeing hollingsworth i must entreat you to
be a messenger between him and me

willingly said i wondering at the strange way in which her mind
seemed to vibrate from the deepest earnest to mere levity what is
the message

true what is it exclaimed zenobia after all i hardly know on
better consideration i have no message tell him tell him something
pretty and pathetic that will come nicely and sweetly into your
ballad anything you please so it be tender and submissive enough
tell him he has murdered me tell him that i'll haunt him  she
spoke these words with the wildest energy and give him no give
priscilla this

thus saying she took the jewelled flower out of her hair and it
struck me as the act of a queen when worsted in a combat discrowning
herself as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride

bid her wear this for zenobia's sake she continued she is a
pretty little creature and will make as soft and gentle a wife as the
veriest bluebeard could desire pity that she must fade so soon these
delicate and puny maidens always do ten years hence let
hollingsworth look at my face and priscilla's and then choose betwixt
them or if he pleases let him do it now

how magnificently zenobia looked as she said this the effect of her
beauty was even heightened by the over-consciousness and
self-recognition of it into which i suppose hollingsworth's scorn
had driven her she understood the look of admiration in my face
and zenobia to the last it gave her pleasure

it is an endless pity said she that i had not bethought myself of
winning your heart mr coverdale instead of hollingsworth's i think
i should have succeeded and many women would have deemed you the
worthier conquest of the two you are certainly much the handsomest
man but there is a fate in these things and beauty in a man has
been of little account with me since my earliest girlhood when for
once it turned my head now farewell

zenobia whither are you going i asked

no matter where said she but i am weary of this place and sick
to death of playing at philanthropy and progress of all varieties of
mock-life we have surely blundered into the very emptiest mockery in
our effort to establish the one true system i have done with it and
blithedale must find another woman to superintend the laundry and you
mr coverdale another nurse to make your gruel the next time you fall
ill it was indeed a foolish dream yet it gave us some pleasant
summer days and bright hopes while they lasted it can do no more
nor will it avail us to shed tears over a broken bubble here is my
hand adieu

she gave me her hand with the same free whole-souled gesture as on the
first afternoon of our acquaintance and being greatly moved i
bethought me of no better method of expressing my deep sympathy than to
carry it to my lips in so doing i perceived that this white hand so
hospitably warm when i first touched it five months since was now
cold as a veritable piece of snow

how very cold i exclaimed holding it between both my own with the
vain idea of warming it what can be the reason it is really
deathlike

the extremities die first they say answered zenobia laughing and
so you kiss this poor despised rejected hand well my dear friend
i thank you you have reserved your homage for the fallen lip of man
will never touch my hand again i intend to become a catholic for the
sake of going into a nunnery when you next hear of zenobia her face
will be behind the black veil so look your last at it now for all is
over once more farewell

she withdrew her hand yet left a lingering pressure which i felt long
afterwards so intimately connected as i had been with perhaps the
only man in whom she was ever truly interested zenobia looked on me as
the representative of all the past and was conscious that in bidding
me adieu she likewise took final leave of hollingsworth and of this
whole epoch of her life never did her beauty shine out more
lustrously than in the last glimpse that i had of her she departed
and was soon hidden among the trees but whether it was the strong
impression of the foregoing scene or whatever else the cause i was
affected with a fantasy that zenobia had not actually gone but was
still hovering about the spot and haunting it i seemed to feel her
eyes upon me it was as if the vivid coloring of her character had
left a brilliant stain upon the air by degrees however the
impression grew less distinct i flung myself upon the fallen leaves
at the base of eliot's pulpit the sunshine withdrew up the tree
trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs gray twilight made the wood
obscure the stars brightened out the pendent boughs became wet with
chill autumnal dews but i was listless worn out with emotion on my
own behalf and sympathy for others and had no heart to leave my
comfortless lair beneath the rock

i must have fallen asleep and had a dream all the circumstances of
which utterly vanished at the moment when they converged to some
tragical catastrophe and thus grew too powerful for the thin sphere of
slumber that enveloped them starting from the ground i found the
risen moon shining upon the rugged face of the rock and myself all in
a tremble



xxvii midnight

it could not have been far from midnight when i came beneath
hollingsworth's window and finding it open flung in a tuft of grass
with earth at the roots and heard it fall upon the floor he was
either awake or sleeping very lightly for scarcely a moment had gone
by before he looked out and discerned me standing in the moonlight

is it you coverdale he asked what is the matter

come down to me hollingsworth i answered i am anxious to speak
with you

the strange tone of my own voice startled me and him probably no
less he lost no time and soon issued from the house-door with his
dress half arranged

again what is the matter he asked impatiently

have you seen zenobia said i since you parted from her at eliot's
pulpit

no answered hollingsworth nor did i expect it

his voice was deep but had a tremor in it

hardly had he spoken when silas foster thrust his head done up in a
cotton handkerchief out of another window and took what he called as
it literally was a squint at us

well folks what are ye about here he demanded aha are you
there miles coverdale you have been turning night into day since you
left us i reckon and so you find it quite natural to come prowling
about the house at this time o night frightening my old woman out of
her wits and making her disturb a tired man out of his best nap in
with you you vagabond and to bed

dress yourself quickly foster said i we want your assistance

i could not for the life of me keep that strange tone out of my
voice silas foster obtuse as were his sensibilities seemed to feel
the ghastly earnestness that was conveyed in it as well as
hollingsworth did he immediately withdrew his head and i heard him
yawning muttering to his wife and again yawning heavily while he
hurried on his clothes meanwhile i showed hollingsworth a delicate
handkerchief marked with a well-known cipher and told where i had
found it and other circumstances which had filled me with a suspicion
so terrible that i left him if he dared to shape it out for himself
by the time my brief explanation was finished we were joined by silas
foster in his blue woollen frock

well boys cried he peevishly what is to pay now

tell him hollingsworth said i

hollingsworth shivered perceptibly and drew in a hard breath betwixt
his teeth he steadied himself however and looking the matter more
firmly in the face than i had done explained to foster my suspicions
and the grounds of them with a distinctness from which in spite of my
utmost efforts my words had swerved aside the tough-nerved yeoman
in his comment put a finish on the business and brought out the
hideous idea in its full terror as if he were removing the napkin from
the face of a corpse

and so you think she's drowned herself he cried i turned away my
face

what on earth should the young woman do that for exclaimed silas
his eyes half out of his head with mere surprise why she has more
means than she can use or waste and lacks nothing to make her
comfortable but a husband and that's an article she could have any
day there's some mistake about this i tell you

come said i shuddering let us go and ascertain the truth

well well answered silas foster just as you say we'll take the
long pole with the hook at the end that serves to get the bucket out
of the draw-well when the rope is broken with that and a couple of
long-handled hay-rakes i'll answer for finding her if she's anywhere
to be found strange enough zenobia drown herself no no i don't
believe it she had too much sense and too much means and enjoyed
life a great deal too well

when our few preparations were completed we hastened by a shorter
than the customary route through fields and pastures and across a
portion of the meadow to the particular spot on the river-bank which i
had paused to contemplate in the course of my afternoon's ramble a
nameless presentiment had again drawn me thither after leaving eliot's
pulpit i showed my companions where i had found the handkerchief and
pointed to two or three footsteps impressed into the clayey margin
and tending towards the water beneath its shallow verge among the
water-weeds there were further traces as yet unobliterated by the
sluggish current which was there almost at a standstill silas foster
thrust his face down close to these footsteps and picked up a shoe
that had escaped my observation being half imbedded in the mud

there's a kid shoe that never was made on a yankee last observed he
i know enough of shoemaker's craft to tell that french manufacture
and see what a high instep and how evenly she trod in it there never
was a woman that stept handsomer in her shoes than zenobia did here
he added addressing hollingsworth would you like to keep the shoe

hollingsworth started back

give it to me foster said i

i dabbled it in the water to rinse off the mud and have kept it ever
since not far from this spot lay an old leaky punt drawn up on the
oozy river-side and generally half full of water it served the
angler to go in quest of pickerel or the sportsman to pick up his wild
ducks setting this crazy bark afloat i seated myself in the stern
with the paddle while hollingsworth sat in the bows with the hooked
pole and silas foster amidships with a hay-rake

it puts me in mind of my young days remarked silas when i used to
steal out of bed to go bobbing for hornpouts and eels
heigh-ho well life and death together make sad work for us all
then i was a boy bobbing for fish and now i am getting to be an old
fellow and here i be groping for a dead body i tell you what lads
if i thought anything had really happened to zenobia i should feel
kind o sorrowful

i wish at least you would hold your tongue muttered i

the moon that night though past the full was still large and oval
and having risen between eight and nine o'clock now shone aslantwise
over the river throwing the high opposite bank with its woods into
deep shadow but lighting up the hither shore pretty effectually not a
ray appeared to fall on the river itself it lapsed imperceptibly
away a broad black inscrutable depth keeping its own secrets from
the eye of man as impenetrably as mid-ocean could

well miles coverdale said foster you are the helmsman how do
you mean to manage this business

i shall let the boat drift broadside foremost past that stump i
replied i know the bottom having sounded it in fishing the shore
on this side after the first step or two goes off very abruptly and
there is a pool just by the stump twelve or fifteen feet deep the
current could not have force enough to sweep any sunken object even if
partially buoyant out of that hollow

come then said silas but i doubt whether i can touch bottom with
this hay-rake if it's as deep as you say mr hollingsworth i think
you'll be the lucky man to-night such luck as it is

we floated past the stump silas foster plied his rake manfully
poking it as far as he could into the water and immersing the whole
length of his arm besides hollingsworth at first sat motionless with
the hooked pole elevated in the air but by and by with a nervous
and jerky movement he began to plunge it into the blackness that
upbore us setting his teeth and making precisely such thrusts
methought as if he were stabbing at a deadly enemy i bent over the
side of the boat so obscure however so awfully mysterious was that
dark stream that and the thought made me shiver like a leaf i might
as well have tried to look into the enigma of the eternal world to
discover what had become of zenobia's soul as into the river's depths
to find her body and there perhaps she lay with her face upward
while the shadow of the boat and my own pale face peering downward
passed slowly betwixt her and the sky

once twice thrice i paddled the boat upstream and again suffered it
to glide with the river's slow funereal motion downward silas
foster had raked up a large mass of stuff which as it came towards
the surface looked somewhat like a flowing garment but proved to be a
monstrous tuft of water-weeds hollingsworth with a gigantic effort
upheaved a sunken log when once free of the bottom it rose partly
out of water all weedy and slimy a devilish-looking object which
the moon had not shone upon for half a hundred years then plunged
again and sullenly returned to its old resting-place for the remnant
of the century

that looked ugly quoth silas i half thought it was the evil one
on the same errand as ourselves searching for zenobia

he shall never get her said i giving the boat a strong impulse

that's not for you to say my boy retorted the yeoman pray god he
never has and never may slow work this however i should really be
glad to find something pshaw what a notion that is when the only
good luck would be to paddle and drift and poke and grope
hereabouts till morning and have our labor for our pains for my
part i shouldn't wonder if the creature had only lost her shoe in the
mud and saved her soul alive after all my stars how she will laugh
at us to-morrow morning

it is indescribable what an image of zenobia at the breakfast-table
full of warm and mirthful life this surmise of silas foster's brought
before my mind the terrible phantasm of her death was thrown by it
into the remotest and dimmest background where it seemed to grow as
improbable as a myth

yes silas it may be as you say cried i the drift of the stream
had again borne us a little below the stump when i felt yes felt
for it was as if the iron hook had smote my breast felt
hollingsworth's pole strike some object at the bottom of the river

he started up and almost overset the boat

hold on cried foster you have her

putting a fury of strength into the effort hollingsworth heaved amain
and up came a white swash to the surface of the river it was the flow
of a woman's garments a little higher and we saw her dark hair
streaming down the current black river of death thou hadst yielded
up thy victim zenobia was found

silas foster laid hold of the body hollingsworth likewise grappled
with it and i steered towards the bank gazing all the while at
zenobia whose limbs were swaying in the current close at the boat's
side arriving near the shore we all three stept into the water bore
her out and laid her on the ground beneath a tree

poor child said foster and his dry old heart i verily believe
vouchsafed a tear i'm sorry for her

were i to describe the perfect horror of the spectacle the reader
might justly reckon it to me for a sin and shame for more than twelve
long years i have borne it in my memory and could now reproduce it as
freshly as if it were still before my eyes of all modes of death
methinks it is the ugliest her wet garments swathed limbs of terrible
inflexibility she was the marble image of a death-agony her arms
had grown rigid in the act of struggling and were bent before her with
clenched hands her knees too were bent and thank god for it in
the attitude of prayer ah that rigidity it is impossible to bear
the terror of it it seemed i must needs impart so much of my own
miserable idea it seemed as if her body must keep the same position
in the coffin and that her skeleton would keep it in the grave and
that when zenobia rose at the day of judgment it would be in just the
same attitude as now

one hope i had and that too was mingled half with fear she knelt as
if in prayer with the last choking consciousness her soul bubbling
out through her lips it may be had given itself up to the father
reconciled and penitent but her arms they were bent before her as
if she struggled against providence in never-ending hostility her
hands they were clenched in immitigable defiance away with the
hideous thought the flitting moment after zenobia sank into the dark
pool when her breath was gone and her soul at her lips was as long
in its capacity of god's infinite forgiveness as the lifetime of the
world

foster bent over the body and carefully examined it

you have wounded the poor thing's breast said he to hollingsworth
close by her heart too

ha cried hollingsworth with a start

and so he had indeed both before and after death

see said foster that's the place where the iron struck her it
looks cruelly but she never felt it

he endeavored to arrange the arms of the corpse decently by its side
his utmost strength however scarcely sufficed to bring them down and
rising again the next instant they bade him defiance exactly as
before he made another effort with the same result

in god's name silas foster cried i with bitter indignation let
that dead woman alone

why man it's not decent answered he staring at me in amazement
i can't bear to see her looking so well well added he after a
third effort tis of no use sure enough and we must leave the women
to do their best with her after we get to the house the sooner
that's done the better

we took two rails from a neighboring fence and formed a bier by laying
across some boards from the bottom of the boat and thus we bore
zenobia homeward six hours before how beautiful at midnight what
a horror a reflection occurs to me that will show ludicrously i
doubt not on my page but must come in for its sterling truth being
the woman that she was could zenobia have foreseen all these ugly
circumstances of death how ill it would become her the altogether
unseemly aspect which she must put on and especially old silas
foster's efforts to improve the matter she would no more have
committed the dreadful act than have exhibited herself to a public
assembly in a badly fitting garment zenobia i have often thought
was not quite simple in her death she had seen pictures i suppose
of drowned persons in lithe and graceful attitudes and she deemed it
well and decorous to die as so many village maidens have wronged in
their first love and seeking peace in the bosom of the old familiar
stream so familiar that they could not dread it where in
childhood they used to bathe their little feet wading mid-leg deep
unmindful of wet skirts but in zenobia's case there was some tint of
the arcadian affectation that had been visible enough in all our lives
for a few months past

this however to my conception takes nothing from the tragedy for
has not the world come to an awfully sophisticated pass when after a
certain degree of acquaintance with it we cannot even put ourselves to
death in whole-hearted simplicity slowly slowly with many a dreary
pause resting the bier often on some rock or balancing it across a
mossy log to take fresh hold we bore our burden onward through the
moonlight and at last laid zenobia on the floor of the old farmhouse
by and by came three or four withered women and stood whispering around
the corpse peering at it through their spectacles holding up their
skinny hands shaking their night-capped heads and taking counsel of
one another's experience what was to be done

with those tire-women we left zenobia



xxviii blithedale pasture

blithedale thus far in its progress had never found the necessity of
a burial-ground there was some consultation among us in what spot
zenobia might most fitly be laid it was my own wish that she should
sleep at the base of eliot's pulpit and that on the rugged front of
the rock the name by which we familiarly knew her zenobia and not
another word should be deeply cut and left for the moss and lichens
to fill up at their long leisure but hollingsworth to whose ideas on
this point great deference was due made it his request that her grave
might be dug on the gently sloping hillside in the wide pasture
where as we once supposed zenobia and he had planned to build their
cottage and thus it was done accordingly

she was buried very much as other people have been for hundreds of
years gone by in anticipation of a death we blithedale colonists had
sometimes set our fancies at work to arrange a funereal ceremony which
should be the proper symbolic expression of our spiritual faith and
eternal hopes and this we meant to substitute for those customary
rites which were moulded originally out of the gothic gloom and by
long use like an old velvet pall have so much more than their first
death-smell in them but when the occasion came we found it the
simplest and truest thing after all to content ourselves with the old
fashion taking away what we could but interpolating no novelties and
particularly avoiding all frippery of flowers and cheerful emblems
the procession moved from the farmhouse nearest the dead walked an
old man in deep mourning his face mostly concealed in a white
handkerchief and with priscilla leaning on his arm hollingsworth and
myself came next we all stood around the narrow niche in the cold
earth all saw the coffin lowered in all heard the rattle of the
crumbly soil upon its lid that final sound which mortality awakens
on the utmost verge of sense as if in the vain hope of bringing an
echo from the spiritual world

i noticed a stranger a stranger to most of those present though
known to me who after the coffin had descended took up a handful of
earth and flung it first into the grave i had given up
hollingsworth's arm and now found myself near this man

it was an idle thing a foolish thing for zenobia to do said he
she was the last woman in the world to whom death could have been
necessary it was too absurd i have no patience with her

why so i inquired smothering my horror at his cold comment in my
eager curiosity to discover some tangible truth as to his relation with
zenobia if any crisis could justify the sad wrong she offered to
herself it was surely that in which she stood everything had failed
her prosperity in the world's sense for her opulence was gone the
heart's prosperity in love and there was a secret burden on her the
nature of which is best known to you young as she was she had tried
life fully had no more to hope and something perhaps to fear had
providence taken her away in its own holy hand i should have thought
it the kindest dispensation that could be awarded to one so wrecked

you mistake the matter completely rejoined westervelt

what then is your own view of it i asked

her mind was active and various in its powers said he her heart
had a manifold adaptation her constitution an infinite buoyancy which
had she possessed only a little patience to await the reflux of her
troubles would have borne her upward triumphantly for twenty years to
come her beauty would not have waned or scarcely so and surely not
beyond the reach of art to restore it in all that time she had
life's summer all before her and a hundred varieties of brilliant
success what an actress zenobia might have been it was one of her
least valuable capabilities how forcibly she might have wrought upon
the world either directly in her own person or by her influence upon
some man or a series of men of controlling genius every prize that
could be worth a woman's having and many prizes which other women are
too timid to desire lay within zenobia's reach

in all this i observed there would have been nothing to satisfy
her heart

her heart answered westervelt contemptuously that troublesome
organ as she had hitherto found it would have been kept in its due
place and degree and have had all the gratification it could fairly
claim she would soon have established a control over it love had
failed her you say had it never failed her before yet she survived
it and loved again possibly not once alone nor twice either and
now to drown herself for yonder dreamy philanthropist

who are you i exclaimed indignantly that dare to speak thus of the
dead you seem to intend a eulogy yet leave out whatever was noblest
in her and blacken while you mean to praise i have long considered
you as zenobia's evil fate your sentiments confirm me in the idea
but leave me still ignorant as to the mode in which you have influenced
her life the connection may have been indissoluble except by death
then indeed always in the hope of god's infinite mercy i cannot
deem it a misfortune that she sleeps in yonder grave

no matter what i was to her he answered gloomily yet without actual
emotion she is now beyond my reach had she lived and hearkened to
my counsels we might have served each other well but there zenobia
lies in yonder pit with the dull earth over her twenty years of a
brilliant lifetime thrown away for a mere woman's whim

heaven deal with westervelt according to his nature and deserts that
is to say annihilate him he was altogether earthy worldly made for
time and its gross objects and incapable except by a sort of dim
reflection caught from other minds of so much as one spiritual idea
whatever stain zenobia had was caught from him nor does it seldom
happen that a character of admirable qualities loses its better life
because the atmosphere that should sustain it is rendered poisonous by
such breath as this man mingled with zenobia's yet his reflections
possessed their share of truth it was a woeful thought that a woman
of zenobia's diversified capacity should have fancied herself
irretrievably defeated on the broad battlefield of life and with no
refuge save to fall on her own sword merely because love had gone
against her it is nonsense and a miserable wrong the result like
so many others of masculine egotism that the success or failure of
woman's existence should be made to depend wholly on the affections
and on one species of affection while man has such a multitude of
other chances that this seems but an incident for its own sake if
it will do no more the world should throw open all its avenues to the
passport of a woman's bleeding heart

as we stood around the grave i looked often towards priscilla
dreading to see her wholly overcome with grief and deeply grieved in
truth she was but a character so simply constituted as hers has room
only for a single predominant affection no other feeling can touch
the heart's inmost core nor do it any deadly mischief thus while we
see that such a being responds to every breeze with tremulous
vibration and imagine that she must be shattered by the first rude
blast we find her retaining her equilibrium amid shocks that might
have overthrown many a sturdier frame so with priscilla her one
possible misfortune was hollingsworth's unkindness and that was
destined never to befall her never yet at least for priscilla has
not died

but hollingsworth after all the evil that he did are we to leave him
thus blest with the entire devotion of this one true heart and with
wealth at his disposal to execute the long-contemplated project that
had led him so far astray what retribution is there here my mind
being vexed with precisely this query i made a journey some years
since for the sole purpose of catching a last glimpse of
hollingsworth and judging for myself whether he were a happy man or
no i learned that he inhabited a small cottage that his way of life
was exceedingly retired and that my only chance of encountering him or
priscilla was to meet them in a secluded lane where in the latter
part of the afternoon they were accustomed to walk i did meet them
accordingly as they approached me i observed in hollingsworth's face
a depressed and melancholy look that seemed habitual the powerfully
built man showed a self-distrustful weakness and a childlike or
childish tendency to press close and closer still to the side of the
slender woman whose arm was within his in priscilla's manner there
was a protective and watchful quality as if she felt herself the
guardian of her companion but likewise a deep submissive
unquestioning reverence and also a veiled happiness in her fair and
quiet countenance

drawing nearer priscilla recognized me and gave me a kind and
friendly smile but with a slight gesture which i could not help
interpreting as an entreaty not to make myself known to hollingsworth
nevertheless an impulse took possession of me and compelled me to
address him

i have come hollingsworth said i to view your grand edifice for
the reformation of criminals is it finished yet

no nor begun answered he without raising his eyes a very small
one answers all my purposes

priscilla threw me an upbraiding glance but i spoke again with a
bitter and revengeful emotion as if flinging a poisoned arrow at
hollingsworth's heart

up to this moment i inquired how many criminals have you reformed

not one said hollingsworth with his eyes still fixed on the ground
ever since we parted i have been busy with a single murderer

then the tears gushed into my eyes and i forgave him for i remembered
the wild energy the passionate shriek with which zenobia had spoken
those words tell him he has murdered me tell him that i'll haunt
him and i knew what murderer he meant and whose vindictive shadow
dogged the side where priscilla was not

the moral which presents itself to my reflections as drawn from
hollingsworth's character and errors is simply this that admitting
what is called philanthropy when adopted as a profession to be often
useful by its energetic impulse to society at large it is perilous to
the individual whose ruling passion in one exclusive channel it thus
becomes it ruins or is fearfully apt to ruin the heart the rich
juices of which god never meant should be pressed violently out and
distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process but should
render life sweet bland and gently beneficent and insensibly
influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end i see
in hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in bunyan's
book of such from the very gate of heaven there is a by-way to the pit

but all this while we have been standing by zenobia's grave i have
never since beheld it but make no question that the grass grew all the
better on that little parallelogram of pasture land for the decay of
the beautiful woman who slept beneath how nature seems to love us
and how readily nevertheless without a sigh or a complaint she
converts us to a meaner purpose when her highest one that of a
conscious intellectual life and sensibility has been untimely balked
while zenobia lived nature was proud of her and directed all eyes
upon that radiant presence as her fairest handiwork zenobia
perished will not nature shed a tear ah no she adopts the
calamity at once into her system and is just as well pleased for
aught we can see with the tuft of ranker vegetation that grew out of
zenobia's heart as with all the beauty which has bequeathed us no
earthly representative except in this crop of weeds it is because the
spirit is inestimable that the lifeless body is so little valued



xxix miles coverdale's confession

it remains only to say a few words about myself not improbably the
reader might be willing to spare me the trouble for i have made but a
poor and dim figure in my own narrative establishing no separate
interest and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other
lives but one still retains some little consideration for one's self
so i keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole
behoof

but what after all have i to tell nothing nothing nothing i
left blithedale within the week after zenobia's death and went back
thither no more the whole soil of our farm for a long time
afterwards seemed but the sodded earth over her grave i could not
toil there nor live upon its products often however in these years
that are darkening around me i remember our beautiful scheme of a
noble and unselfish life and how fair in that first summer appeared
the prospect that it might endure for generations and be perfected as
the ages rolled away into the system of a people and a world were my
former associates now there were there only three or four of those
true-hearted men still laboring in the sun i sometimes fancy that i
should direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward and entreat them to
receive me for old friendship's sake more and more i feel that we
had struck upon what ought to be a truth posterity may dig it up and
profit by it the experiment so far as its original projectors were
concerned proved long ago a failure first lapsing into fourierism
and dying as it well deserved for this infidelity to its own higher
spirit where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts the town
paupers aged nerveless and disconsolate creep sluggishly afield
alas what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of
generous effort

my subsequent life has passed i was going to say happily but at all
events tolerably enough i am now at middle age well well a step
or two beyond the midmost point and i care not a fig who knows it a
bachelor with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise i have
been twice to europe and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each
visit being well to do in the world and having nobody but myself to
care for i live very much at my ease and fare sumptuously every day
as for poetry i have given it up notwithstanding that dr
griswold as the reader of course knows has placed me at a fair
elevation among our minor minstrelsy on the strength of my pretty
little volume published ten years ago as regards human progress in
spite of my irrepressible yearnings over the blithedale reminiscences
let them believe in it who can and aid in it who choose if i could
earnestly do either it might be all the better for my comfort as
hollingsworth once told me i lack a purpose how strange he was
ruined morally by an overplus of the very same ingredient the want
of which i occasionally suspect has rendered my own life all an
emptiness i by no means wish to die yet were there any cause in
this whole chaos of human struggle worth a sane man's dying for and
which my death would benefit then provided however the effort did
not involve an unreasonable amount of trouble methinks i might be bold
to offer up my life if kossuth for example would pitch the
battlefield of hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode and
choose a mild sunny morning after breakfast for the conflict miles
coverdale would gladly be his man for one brave rush upon the levelled
bayonets further than that i should be loath to pledge myself

i exaggerate my own defects the reader must not take my own word for
it nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped
strenuously and struggled not so much amiss frostier heads than mine
have gained honor in the world frostier hearts have imbibed new
warmth and been newly happy life however it must be owned has
come to rather an idle pass with me would my friends like to know
what brought it thither there is one secret i have concealed it all
along and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape one
foolish little secret which possibly may have had something to do with
these inactive years of meridian manhood with my bachelorship with
the unsatisfied retrospect that i fling back on life and my listless
glance towards the future shall i reveal it it is an absurd thing
for a man in his afternoon a man of the world moreover with these
three white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a
crow's-foot on each temple an absurd thing ever to have happened and
quite the absurdest for an old bachelor like me to talk about but
it rises to my throat so let it come

i perceive moreover that the confession brief as it shall be will
throw a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing
incidents and is indeed essential to the full understanding of my
story the reader therefore since i have disclosed so much is
entitled to this one word more as i write it he will charitably
suppose me to blush and turn away my face

i i myself was in love with priscilla

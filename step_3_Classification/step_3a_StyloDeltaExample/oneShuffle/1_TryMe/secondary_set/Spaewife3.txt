this is the rehearsal divers events and
issues which came to pass in scotland many
years ago at the time whereof it is intended
to speak king robert the second that
name and the first the starts was long
gathered to his fathers but he had left behind
heirs and successors as all monarchs
and other great men naturally do and from
them and out their pretensions arose the
incidents and matter this strange and very
solemn tale
it happened in the lusty years his juve
lulity that the same king robert had entervol
i a
 the spaewife
gained an effectual dalliance with a fair and
comely damsel called elizabeth the daughter
 sir adam mure rowan and by
her he had a progeny sons and daughters
for causes and reasons but whether 
state or inconstancy is not set forth neither
in the histories the time nor in the chronicles
 the kingdom this robert during the
life and reign his uncle king david the
second estraid himself from the gentle
elizabeth mure by which great disloyalty
on his part she was stricken with sorrow and
languishing in the solitude neglect she
drooped her head and became pale and pining
and died with a heavy sigh
he afterwards addressed his amorous aspirations
to euphemia ross the daughter
 the proud and warlike earl that name
and was to her publicly married with all
the pomp and pageantries befitting the wedding
 the heir to the scottish crown with
this lady he heed several years and begat
the spaewife 
according to the custom the age sons
and daughters whom walter lord 
buchan and earl athos caithness and
strathearn is ordained to act a principal part
in this our chosen and eventful history
about the king david's reign the
lady euphemia ross being dead robert
repented his infidelity towards that sweet
and patient gentlewoman elizabeth mure
and acknowledged before the king his uncle
that she had been his wedded wife and
that he had procured from his holiness pope
clement the sixth a dispensation by which
his children by hef were legitimated and
when on the death the king he ascended
the throne the first exercise his regal
authority and princely influence was to procure
by a strong handling the interests
and loyalty the states the kingdom in
parliament assembled an act declaration
wherdy the children his first love elizabeth
mure were admitted as his rightful
 the spaewife
heirs and an elder order than those the
lady eufemia boss
thus was the venom dissension iron
the beginning instilled as it were into the blood
 the princes the royal house stuart
and thus did their progenitor while intending
jusce and atonement work out against his
own offspring a machination prerogative
fraught with the seeds irremediable enmity
is it therefore to be wondered that the
righteous heavens with an unparalleled constancy
 displeasure have continued through
so long a succession bloody and funereal
events to manifest their judgment on the
doomed and guilty race 
but not to expatiate on those old and early
crimes let it suffice to say that although
during the remainder king robert's days
he partook some calm and consolation in
the reflection having atoned as far as he
then could to the fair and mild elizabeth
mure for the blight he had cast on her fame
the pabwife 
and honour in the bloom her youth and
beauty he had not long departed thus life in
the ancient castle dundonald when the
seed that fatal policy began to germinate
and sprout into effect
john the lord ibyle and earl carrick
the firstborli son elizabeth mure was according
to the beforementioned settlement 
the order succession acknowledged as the
heir the qngdom but at that era strange
and dismal presages having become rife
amongst the people and it appearing that
they were too deeply impressed and forspread
for the government to treat as fantastical he
was advised to allow himself to be proclaimed
king by the style and title robert the
third in the hope thereby dispersing those
gloomy movements the name robert
from the renown and glories the bruce
time and from the peaceful prosperity his
f father's rgn being deemed singularly auspicious
the devices statesmen however
 the spaewife
could prove no avail against the decrees 
fate sentence had been pronounced on high
against the race and generates the starts
and the revolutions time have but served
to bring to pass the necessary consequences
 ther direful and irremediable doom
this third robert beg an indolent inclination
and infirm health as mind left
his brother the duke albany in the exercise
 the royal power to which he had
been appointed in the latter days their
fadieraid this duke a restless and ambitious
man strivings all expedients and con
trivanoes policy to make a way for himself
to the kingly possession the llmme so
turned the youthful incontinence his
nephew the bear to the crown to the furtherance
at the purpose he had in view that
he caused him to perish hunger in the
palace falklandn occurrence which so
moved the grieved and dismayed father that
he sent his next and only son prince james
th spaewife 
out scotland to be educated at the french
court in order that he might be safe from the
crafty policy this ruthless unde and his
other treacherous kinsmen but in the voyage
to france the young prince was taken by
the english and carried a prisoner to london
where he waa detained many years
meantime walter earl atholl the eldest
son which the lady euphemia ross bore
to the second robert and who but for the
act settlement by which the pretensions
 his mother's offspring were set aside and
preference given to those elizabeth mure
would have succeeded to the crown remained
moody and discontented with his fortunes
but though the duke so yearned to be all
king and though the earl atholl repined
at the unjust exclusion which as he conceived
he was suffering from his right still there
was no immediate prospect that either the
one would be gratified in his wishes or the
other indemnified for his privations by any

whjfck the estates the realm had proclaimed
prince james king scotland the lords
barons and clergy then assembled at perth
rose to rptum to ther respective castles and
dwellings and the earl atholl and the
duke albany who was appointed regent
together with divers other noblemen his
renown and ancient pedigree came riding in
gallant array with their intermingled trains
towards that ancient seat abrogated royalty
the pictish town abernethy where they
divided themselves according to the different
wts which it behoved them to take
the regent proceeded with his officers and
retinue eastward to his princely residence at
falkland and the earl atholl courteously
bidding him farewell turned his horses head
 
 th spaewire
towards glenphaerg being minded to pass
thorough the same to kinross and thence to
dunfermline where at the time his lady was
then abiding but on reaching the entrance 
the glen he found the road had been so damaged
by the torrents oi the bygone winter
that it was almost impassable he had however
set his heart on going that way and he
would not return so ordering his men to
dismount he dismounted himself and giving
the bridle to a groom walked on alone while
the youth led forward the charger before him
it was then the green and pleasant month
dl may when the leaves are bright and the
waters clear and the birds and bees and
blossoms and butterflies are all fluttering in
the blitheness the sunshine cheerfulness
shone on the foreheads the mountains and
the valley stratagem anikd to the gracious
heavens that were shedding with a bountiful
hand the treasures summer into her broad
and flowery apron the stripling pages 
the paewifb 
lord atholl shouted and divided their hands
as they startled the mavis and the bhiekhird
from the boughs the hazel that feathered
the steeps the glen the menatanns
whistled and carolled andtheciqibearer who
was too corpulent to diamoimt and who hsml
permission from the earl on acepnnt his
wist and age to keep the saddle often ashe
travelled up the narrow margin die
noisy brook snatched a leaf from the overhanging
fairdb and rubbing it between his
thumb and fingers inhaled the scent and de
dared it more delicious than the perfume ct
the oldest malvern
but their lord was sullen his blows were
knotted with cogitation and when the horse
which the groom led before him paused and
looked down from the perilous cornice a
pice along wfaidi die road lay seemingly
afraid to pass a sharp and jutting rode wudli
loosened by the thaws the early spring
had in its fall almost blocked ixp die passage
is the paewifs
he chided impatiently and yrs angry without
reason
 what makes you s wud at the hrs
adding lord atholl fnit's a vise beaat cried
a voice fitxm behind the rock and in the
tame moment a young woman a wild and
uncouth appearance came into view stretching
out her hand as if to intercept the horse
from coming forward
 who are you p said the eazl nnrpnsed
at the salutation and the interruption
 do ye no ken me simple o dunhlane 
i thought every bodie kent the ta'enaway
replied anniple adding when maries
drummond the weavers wife was brought to

hodie had in her arms it was ind in a
cradle and lappet wi tow but when lucky
fish gaed in the momii to bring the baby

ayant the seas and neath the hills but
lie fairies have nae power to put heavenly
souls until ther effigies which is the cause
folks say that i have a want some o the
seven senses but stand ye there lord
atholl for i was on my way to seek you
 indeed t said the earl smiling compassionate
at the rhapsody the por creature
 and what is your pleasure anniple with me
 a word d wisdom that should be told in
secret bid your men bide where they are
and come ye here afore your horse to this hole
o the rock and i'll tell you
the earl almost unconscious what he
did stepped forward and went round the rock
while the groom that had hold his horse
by the bridle waved his hand to those who
were behind and they all halted
well resumed the earl what have
you to tell me 
 the paewifs
 i have dreamt a dreams replied aitniple
raising her hands exultingly and it was th
about you lord atholl o it was a vision
 grandeur if i had a soul to live after
the weaver's wife's wean dies among the
euriesfor when that happens and were
it to happen even now ye would see me fall
down on the ground frenent you just a
withered between but i was saying that

 but how came i anniple into your

i have seen you though cried anniple
 the tower on the hillhead canna be hidden
though a wee bush will scot the poor
man's bield
and what may your dream have been
about xo bring you so far in quest me 
 ye'll have to give me something before i
the spaewifs 
tdl jdu replied anniple importantly tossing
bac her long matted lodes with her right
and left hand and erecting herself into a
posture irfaich showed how highly she considered
the value her apocalypse
lord atihfflbiiled and taking a purse from
his belt presented her with a piece alter
 another's said die holding out her hand
with the money lying in it
elsie earl drew out another piece sod ina
it in her palm
 three's aye canny my lords said annile
 mftke it ee or

this still holding her hand stretched out
struck earl and he stood for a moment
with his forefinger in the mouth his purse
evidently surprised and in some degree
daunted
 a free heart make a fair fortunes said
ample and if ye get what i bode yeu
no grudge me gold
 the spaemhefs
the earl dipped his hand into his purse
but having no more silver he drew it out
entity
anniple started at the motion and retiring
aside said with an offended aiiv
 pass on my lord atholl and let your
train pass on its an ill omen that ye oilnna
make good your purposes
 i have been fooled said the earl to
himself and he called to his groom kelso
by name to bring his horse forward but
anniple laid her right hand on his left
arm and showing him the two pieces 
alter looked sharply in his face as she
saide
is that a fit largess to one who comes to
tell you 
what exclaimed the earl eagerly
but in the same moment he flung off the hand
with which she held him by the arm
 lord atholl twelve maun dee or i bethe
lahxl was the sang that sir laurie
the spaewifs 
gnome drdnaik siuig when but a page
in the hall o monteith and yet or thirty
year were come and gave he was the laird
hist how many stand atween you and
the crown lord athoii f
the earl looked sternly but made ho
answer
 i can tel though ye cannae exclaimed
anniple trkunaantiy and she began to
ooum on her fingers the different sons and
dpflcendimts in the male line bobett the
second bhining
 theresa jamie the prince and robin
the regent and murdoch his son and his
sons threesix already that no right i
saw but fives

vehement the kingdom no heed being
taken df the rightful king who was all that
long time languishing in captivity among his
natural foemen the english
the regent murdoch was a man mundi
unlike his restless proud and ambitious father
who had so long sat the saddle the
state with a slack bridle and a sharp spur
for he was a remiss and easy nature and
though it could not well be said that he was
a doer ill deeds yet might it be averred
justly that he permitted them to be done for
 th paswife
by his indolence crimes were allowed to grow
to customs
those weak qualities however which amounted
to vices in his public faculties were
in the minor duties his household such endearing
virtues that his lady loved him with a
matchless constancy asecm and his
sums while they were merry playing boys
child never find a happier sharer their
pranks so that the castle falkland while
the kingdom was rent with feuds and raids
ind all the woes that flow from a feeble sceptre
in a weak hand was for many a day the
blithest dwelling high or low that could be
found in any land
but when the young lords grew to manhood
they became rude and riotous little
heeding their indulgent father's admonitions
and giving themselves up to those bold vices
which made poor scotland so long weep tears
 blood
thus was the felicity which reigned in
the spabwhu si
the castle falkland put to flight and the
weak and easy murdoch could only complain
to his sympathizing duchess their obstreperous
and licentious schism
but isabella duchess albany the
daughter the earl lennox was a lady
 an august mind and endowed with an
equanimity not early shaken from its steadfastness
though a most true and devoted
wife she was not blind to the faults in the
public character her lord and she urged him
to resign the regency that some firmer hand
might curb the disturbers the kingdom
and restrain the rash and headlong spirit
which was taking possession all the noble
youth the time murdoch however was
averse to this both from the effort that the
act would require and the dangers which he
knew it might bring upon the rights his
family for in the event his resignation
he saw that the earl atholl would naturally
be appointed his successor and cons
the spaewife
niderixi the nuumer in which that nobleman
and the other royal children by die same
mother had been set aside in the order 
succession he could not doubt that were hein
iiuthcnity he would leave no means untried
to bastardize the progeny o elizabeth
mure at least if king james should happen
to die in england thus it was that from
aelgsh purposes and altogether forgetful 
the claims the people did this other stuart
put to hazard his own renown the honour 
the state and the fortunes his family
but the turbulence his sons waxed everyday
more intolerable and they set his pubme
and paternal authority alike at nought in so
much that one morning when he was preparing
to take the pastime hawking on the
diamondhills and while arrow his favourite
falcon was on his arm the young lord walter
requested that he would give it to him 
and the lord james coming up at the moment
also begged to have the bird and they
the paswife s
quarrelled condemning to whom it should be
given which so chafed their father that he
indignantly ordered them to retire and learn
to reverence him better whereupon walter
snatched arrow fixxm his hand and twisted
its neck
the regent was not more astonished than
grieved at this impious insolence his son
he looked severely at the two rash youths fora
moment without speaking and the tear
rushed into his eyes
 thisbe said he truly exceeds endurance
unhappy boys since you so far forget
what is due to your father i will bring
back him that we all must obeys
he then left them in the hal where they
continued for some time reviling each other
and went and forthwith gave orders for the
immediate assembling the states in paria
meat in order to move them to consent that the
necessary meus for the ransom the king
might be taken in which duty he laboured
 thx spaewife
wkh such unwonted earnestness that in due
season the thing was fought to pass apt
james after manning the princes joanna
cousin to the king england when hostages
were given for the payment his ransom
was brought home to appease and console
his afflicted kingdcn
in the meantime these proceedings on the
part duke murdoch had caused great
parlance and many controversies discourse
both in hall and bower especially in the castle
 atholl where every thing that bore a tendency
to establish the descendants elizabeth
mure in the possession the throne
was considered among the retainers as a wrong
done to the rights die earl their master
audit happened one evening that the young
lord robert stuart the ears nephew and
presumptive heir being present with regulus
menzies the chaplain and certain friars who
had come from ducked to partake the
good cheer the castle they began to dis
the spaewif 
course i these things when father regulus
spoke the marvellous salutation which his
lord had met with in glenphaerg from annile
 dunblane
 though the woman's said father regulus
unblane spaewife should be thought entitled
to so much homage as it is said she
vol i b
 the spaewife
receives forever predictions from the common
ally
be counselled by me rejoined the churchman
 and let not your noble uncle shake
your religious faith the wonderful heavens
often achieve their greatest purposes by the
most simple means though the oracles 
wisdom do not always spear to the incapable
judgment men commensurate to the
revelations which they declare yet are they
not the less worthy our reverential belief
i have myself known manifold instances 
the most marvellous vindication those unheeded
truths which from time to time the
mysterious heavens in their dark workings
cause to be published the wherefore no man
can tel nor why it is that the organs which
declare them are by the abject condition 
their human faculties seemingly so unmeet
once m my younger years i happened to
be in the hall milton when the lord was
tus pabwifb 
trying on a new surcoat the tailor with his
pntioe were standing by and the prentice
was a famished and iodyooking creature
with ug blue eye more like the dull mindless
blobs a dead mans head than the windows
 a hiring spirit he had a mouth that was
 a piano in a chapterhouse to behold
and there was an altogethemess horror
and simplicity about the lad very strange and
dismal to see
 ireton being very vote his brave garb
shewed it to his lady present the doublet
into fitting as he gambolled in his jocularity
with her when suddenly the prentice who
was so standing by with the shears in his
hand having no respect to the ears degree
cried for grot sake put oflp that coat as
ye wish to live o lady as ye love my
lord let it never be on him v
 what for would ye not bave me to
wear this gallant coat p replied milton mar
velkng at the wild creatures panic i never
 the pabwife
had a brave on my shoulders but the poor
ashyfaced boy dunk away behind hia most
for the mystical spirit had left him
 the lady as however lightened aid
going towards the lad criivedto know wherefore
he had mate sub an unearthly outcry 
and after a time the trembling thing declared
that he saw a bloody dirk sticking in
the skirt the surcoat on hearing which
the lady milton controlled her lhxi to
put it from him and he gave it to sir david
de hepburn and the very next night when
sir david was going fnn the castle to north
berwick in the glimpse the setting moon
some secret enemy the earl stabbed him in
the side aye just where the tailors prentice
thought he saw the bloody rent o the visionary
dagger now this i was an eyewitness to
lord robert myself and surely there was
nothing about the wit and judgment o that
vapoury and fantastical creature to make a
man have any faith in his foreknowledge
tbe spaewife 
the young lord listened with the look 
one more idbraid than believing at this recital 
which fath regulus noticing added
 nay my lord i can tell you something
still more wonderful and not less true i
knew a man by name aliter ballihgall a
skipper who being driven with his vessel by
stress weather into a port in the macdonald
isle when he was coming round to
dundee wi a cargo cordovan leather and
sackherxies from hispania lay windbound
thee many a weary day in so much that
his thoughts began to languish for his home
and hearths
 let none my lord tell you therefore
how these thingsmay not be for that such
preternatural shows are made to the eyes 
men and women and in forms seemingly most
the spabwife 
palpable is to me out all doubt and that
sects follow answerable thereto is as little
questionable
 when i was in my novitiate at campus
we had a servitor a solitary humour
who during the harvest time warded
in the bam and nightly slept there one
momii he told the abbot that he could not
any longer abide in his service for that he
had several times seen a dead corpse in its
windingsheet straightened bedde him as he
lay alone in the bam by which tale the
abbot was so moved and on account the
great trepidation the man that he forthwith
disturbed him on the following year how
every when the mans dismay had passed off
he being delivered from his fears came back
to us and was again hired for the harvest but
one day he fell rom a stack com that he
was helping to build and hang sorely hurt he
was taki to the bam and laid on the spot

where he had formerly slept and there soon
ds the spaewife
after he expired the vision he had seen being
thereby clearly proven to have been a warning
to himself
 that we may have some inward intimation
 the time our own said stuart
 is not to be questioned but sights and
knowledges things concerning others and
for no plain cause is matter that may well be
contested
say not so my lord i iedde ye give
not yourself up to such perilous incredulity
exclaimed father regulus have soil not
heard the story sir william de leone's
page when his master was embarking at
dundee with the earl wilton for the service
 the french king charles an
old demented woman that made her living by
seeking her bread and was not regarded as in
her right mind came to sir william and said
 was me sir knight hae ye nae better creeds
ing for that winsome bairn than a windingmeet
p which made sir william to laugh for
the spaewife 

the page was very gaily apparelled but
scarcely had the bark put to sea when the page
fell sick and the very day she oast anchor
on the french land he was laid in his grave
i could give many more proofs as incontestable
as all dies but i think what is said
is enough to prove that there are mysteries in
and about us which are not the more to be
questioned because they cannot be expounded 
and i marvel and admire that wise men and
men lore and gifts should be so shy to
believe that there are any visions the kind
whereof i have spoken for what is more
certain than that good and bad angels have
communed with the inhabitants the earth p
was it not evil spirits that presented visions
and audible voices to the four hundred and
fifty false prophets ahab and the four
hundred prophets the groves and surely
it is as easy to work upon one sense as upon
anotherupon the sight as upon the hearing 
and we know from the story saul and the
 the fabwife
witch endow that necrcniiaiicers and magicians
themselves have not only seen shapes
and forms but likewise have allowed others
to see the seme beings superior and beyond
their art
 i do remember that many years ago
there was an aged women in auchtertool
who was accustomed to give very miraculous
responses and who averred that she had
been dead her soul translated and allowed
to return from the other world i questioned
her myself as to what she had witnessed
there and she told me that she lead
seen her daughter who had died about a
year before that wchnan was as i learnt
from her own children liable at times to fall
into a syncope and when questioned as she
lay in that state concerning things yet in the
depths the future she was instructed what
response to make on removing by pictures
seen in her trance the things that were to
be even as they would visibly come to pass
the spabwivjl 
father regulus would peradventure have
continued to speak farther these marvels 
nature and the incommunicable intelligence
which some persons are enabled to hold
with the world spirits but stuart interrupted
his descant by sajinj
 then you do think that thb same space
wife whereof we were discoursing may possess
the pow discerning what is coming to
pass though as the earl says she lacks in
the concord the ordinary senses 
 it were impious to doubt its replied the
father inthefaee so many accomplished
predictions but 
what he would have added b unknown
tor the youi lord became very thoughtful
and soon after retired from the recess the
hall where this discourse had taken place
and whole was gone father regulus replenished
the flagon for the solace his
pious visitors from ducked
 the sfabwite
chap 
next morning by break day stuart was
mounted and wiw with but a single groom
on the road to dunblane to consult anniple
the takenaway concerning ins future fortunes
oh reaching the town wmh he did early the
day following conceiving himself unknown
there he inquired freely for her dwelling at a 
band children whom he saw playing in
the street and they conducted him to the
back the abbey churchyard wall where
they pointed to a hovel constructed sticks
laid loosely against it and rudely covered
with turf and strawa grouisum den for a
human creature
there said a boy aet for ony gude that i can tell you ye
might just as weel hae bidet wi the auld defiles
bargain in the towers athos heu rue
the day he diana pay me for the braw dream
i dreamt for him
stuart stood aghast to find that she knew
him so well and was ahnosc afraid to look at
the malicious satisfaction with which she enjoyed
the anticipation some ill fortune
that was hatching for his uncle the solemnity
 his dread was also enhanced by
the way in which she seemed to recollect the
incident that had so provoked her spleen
notwithstanding the long period which had
elapsed he winded at the moment that
he had never come near her and was on the
ths sfabwifsi sb
fxnnt retumiiig to his heme wheii she
loved up to him with a peculiar glance 
her eye that fixed him to the spot
 yeu no gai away robin stuart its
no me that ye need to fears there's a winsome
dame in a bonny bower that sill maybe
wise you to mair wae and then she began
to sing
 oae scour the silver basin
and scour it bright and fine
for it maun kep the gentle blood
that's red red like the wine
the very spirit stuart was frozen by
her dismal cadence at the conclusion she
again looked up at him with the comer her
eye and laughed crouching her shoulders
fairly and rubbing her hands as she said 
but birl your bodies robin stuart or
ye'll get nae spacing frae me
stuart scarcely aware what he did took
his purse from his belt and flung it into her
lap she snatched it with a childish shriek
 the spaewife
 glee and pouring the contents into her
hand flourished the empty purse round her
head as it were in triumph she then counted
the money and finding an odd piece she
paused and said to herself thais no
canny
then she restored the money into the purse
and gave it to the dog and he immediately
carried it into the far comer the hovel and
lay down
after a short pause during which she
looked steadily at stuart the tear shot into
her eye and she began to weep and sob
saying to herself with her hands clasped
he's a braw lad o a leil nature tyke
bring back the sellers
the dog instantly returned and laid down
the purse on her lap
hae robin stuart said she take back
your bodies vl space no fortune to you 
and holding up the purse she sang with a
wild and careless freedom
the spaewife 
 and lftsaxtis deet and dives i'll rick
o skk sick man was lie
and he said to death o winsome death
a my goud and my gear i wil give
 gin ye but taste yon physic cup
 sweet death and let me be 
dives wanted death to take the ply sic that he
might grow better but death took him away
to the in place robin stuart its well for me
i have nae soul to be flesh for the devil's brimstone
broth
stuart shuddered
 take back your purse said anniple
again
 nay it is yours i have given it and it
must abide with your replied stuart
then tyke take it ben the house again
the dog obeyed and his mistress began to
churn in a musical manner to herself and
to toss the straws which covered her lap first
with the forefinger the left hand and syne
with the similar finger her right taking no
 the spaewife
farther heed the young prince who stood
wondering and fearful beside her
after the lapse several minutes she
looked up and said are ye aye there yet
rolnn stuart and then seemingly wholly
occupied with her own fancies she turned
from side to side pulling here and there a
straw and twirling it as she sung 
 o was me o was me o was me mary 
i had a joe and he loved me weel
and he danced at castle cary 
but his rosy cheek rosy cheek rosy cheek mary
 and the blithe blue erne that won my heart
lie ivied at castle cary
 were i to guess by your reluctance and
these snatches old ditties said stuart
 what you could tell is that i am to be
fihorthved now as i hope never to account
life a thing that a true man should set any
store by say if i shall prosper as a lover 
anniple smiled and replied there's
nae doubt about that i and she added signs
the paewife 
picardy if the lady's kind in a moment
after she subjoined with solemnity your
fortune hangs upon a maidens honesty
 but how in what way t cried stuart
eagerly anniplehoweverinstead making
him any answer took up the comer the
blanket which hung about her shoulders and
began to imitate the gestures one busily
sewing
 ye sees said she that fm very throng 
my kirtle needs clouding dinna fash me ony
mair wt your speerings
 why jive you told me so much since
you refuse to tell me more exclaimed stuart
unpadeatly
o wed weel replied anniple peevishly
come when that poor silly shaving rabbit

instead however making any reply she
af the spaewife
called her dog and began to caress him sayhigh
 my kind messinamy brave messina
that barks awa the illdeeds brats that pelt
me wi states and she turned up the comer
 her eye towards stuart and laughing immoderately
said i rede ye robin stuart
hae mense hae mense for tyke can bite
 the feature's insane a mere bomfool
said stuart angrily to himself and was moving
away but before he had left the hovel
ten or twelve paces she started out and
drawing the blanketmantle close around her
with one hand she ran after him and seized
him by the skirt the surcoat with the other
addressing him with a soft and earnest solicitude

 there's a cross and cloud in thy lot robin stuart
there's a light in a bower to beguile robin stuart 
there's deaths ane and three and a ship on the sea 
but the flower in the ha i would ln wisewa
for the duke it will bring upon thee robin stuart
the slow and tender pathos with which she
the spaewifs 
delivered this mystical jargon moved him to
reurd her with a compassionate contrition
and he said with much gentleness in his
voice
 poor thing it is ill to redd thy ravelled
fancies but i will order thee to be better
heeded hereafter
 it's kindly thought and softly saide replied
anniple but who should care forme
 when the fairies made me up o a ben
weed and laid me among the tow for the
weavers wife's bonny lassie bairn i was a
thing made to suffer aversion therefore it
is that all christian creatures hate me that
folks flee frae the sight o me that wives
draw in their weans and shut their doors when
i gg y that i maun eat beans frae the
sbawp and com fra the stalk that the
wicked rain pursues me and the cruel hail
pelts me that the cold wind bites me and
the fireflights flash on me there was a
wee white lambie playing beside its mother
 the spabwife
on a boxmy green knowe it was an innocent
thing and i thought it looked kindly at me
which never man nor womankind had deme 
but when i gaed to warm it in my arms it
too was frightened and ran blessing away
all living creatures see and ken that ism a
thing the holy heavens had no hand in the
making o i wish that the weavers wife's
wean were dead in the fairyland that i
might lie on the loan what i am a weed to
be trampled on
stuart was melted to sadness by the wailing
simplicity this complaint her abject
estate for though he could never think that
a creature with so much sweet blood in her
bosom was a thing so fantastical as she reported
herself to be he was yet so filled with
awe and strange wonderment by her prophetic
breathing that he could not but own she
had qualities above the common faculties 
the human world and was indeed a being
conceived in some mysterious eclipse nature
the spaewife 
he stood in consequence doubtful and irresolute
what to say or do but she relieved him
speedily from his perplexity by darting away
and huddling herself down beneath the litter
in her hotel

chap v
during the regencies the two dukes 
albany particularly in the time murdoch
the domains belonging to the crown had beci
squandered among the upholders their unrighteous
administration in so much that
king james not less resenting this traitorous
prodigality than his brothers cruel death
and the long neglect he had suffered in being
left a captive with the english did among
the first acts his royal freedom procure
from the states in parliament a law to inquire
what lands had belonged to the crown in the
time king david the second and to call
oh those who possessed them to sow their
charters
v the knights and barons who were the
the spabwifb 
faction the house albany being alarmed
at the vigour with which the king showed
himself determined to carry this law into effects
consulted together aid by dint fears
for himself and the representations his
partisans miirdpch was persuaded to forma
league with a strong host those who
were participators in the spoliation the
crown to oppose the execution the law
 this confederacy being divulged the king
his majesty was so offended thereat that disregarding
the turbulent temper those irascible
and daring chiefs he ordered many 
them to be arrested and summoned a partial
ment to meet forthwith at perth with a view
to higher purposes
this bold enterprise for a scottish king
to undertake in that age anarchy was
promulgated on the morning the same
diy on which stuart went to consult the
spaewife so that after he had parted from
her in the manner rehearsed and had re
vol i c
 the spaewife
mounted axki returned to the highway he was
surprised to meet hanksmi coming in great
haste from soone where thecourt tiber was and
the whole country beocmieas it were ave wide
wonder and conjecture at the sound and tt
 such unwonted energy in the government
stuart a brave and gallant youth knew
too well both from chronicle and tale that
such speed in the emissaries the king betokened
no prosperity to some the princely
nobles and fearing on account the jealousy
with which all the descendants euphemia
boss were regarded by those elizabeth
mure that the storm might light on the
house aihou to which he was the presumptive
heir instead returning to atholl
castle he clapped spurs to his horse and
went to perth where be soon learned what
the king had done and that his royal indignation
was kindled against the faction the
house albany it entered however neither
into his imagination nor into that any
the spawife 
other that aught was then mediated against
duke murdoch himself the smgs unde nor
agaimi the three princes his sons and there
tore was he none displeased to hear the news
since tiiie object tfaeing wrath seemed to
be oily to check the arrogance a faction
 whkh the power die house atboli
coidd not fail to be necessarily strengthened 
and being likewise informed that his uncle
the earl adiol was expected at scone
he resolved to await his coming
the earl atholl was a subtle and long
forecasting man iurwd sententious and well
skilled in the diancies worldly wisdom 
moreover he had the st an enticing and
urbane demeanour which from the first in
tctview had won upon his nephew the king
who boa for affection therefrom and his
deep inst men and business trusted him
with an entire confidence
when the earl arrived at perth he carried
stuart with him to scone and for the first
s the spaewifk
time introduced him to his loyal kinsman
who seeing him in the mom manhood and
 a bold and princely carriage was instanter
moved to treat him with much courtesy
from that day he became his majesty's favourite
companion in all hardy pastimes and
the adventures hawking and hunting but
he was not taken into his councils for king
james though still but a young man himself
conferred in his royal ofisce only with ancient
and grave men sage from experience and 
an austere and reserved wisdomnot that he
questioned the discretion his kinsman albeit
there were those who accused stuart 
dissimulation and hollowness heart but if
the king had indeed any discernment these
defects he assuredly considered them rather
as faults nature which no man can amend
than sins carriage which by virtue may be
overcome
in the meantime duke murdoch with
isabella his duchess and two their sons
the spaewife 
alexander and james were abiding in the
stately towers falkland little dreading or
dreaming the cloud that was gathering over
them which from their alliances among the
nobles their faction haply they might consider
as a thing which could never be the
two young lords were indeed reckless 
destiny and pursued their own headstrong
courses as if the kii was still a prisoner
among his enemies and their indulgent father
still the irresponsible regent the realm
but it came to pa that on the day when
the king had in such sudden haste summoned
the earl athos to scone some hint 
what was meditated against the confederated
nobles arrived at falkland which so exasperated
those two fierce princes that they vowed
vengeance against the king i he resolved to
persist in his english methods government 
for so like all their faction they called his
majestys bold and impartial justicethe
wych to hear caused alarm to their mothers
 the spaewife
and she strove in vain with all h kind
counselling to appease their reballbus menaces

 the kings said she is a just man
and though in weeding this pocnr refllb which
has almost run to waste he may m his great
task pull com away with the tares still his endeavour
deserves tl praise all good mei
and it would well become you my dear sons
who are the nearest princes hia blood to
honour and assist lus noble undertakings
 would you exclaimed the lord james
 have us who are so near ta him in blood
truckle to him like base hinds 
 no replied the duchess but i cannot
deny to mysdf that i fear ye have done
many things which it may not stand easy with
so righteous a inhlr to pardon and therefore
i crave you to give bim at least no newnor
greater cause onse
 you feel note mothers said the lord alexander
 in thb as the duchess albany
the spaewif 
should d occ ye not that his vengeance is directed
all against our friends p
these harsh words smote the duchess to
the heart and tears rushed into her eyes as
she said with much fervoui
 headstrong and irreverent boys get ye
hice and learn the homage that is due to
your prince and to your parent what but
your fiithers power and that rank which
makes you so bold in your wild courses has
protected you fifom the avenging law do
you forget that the duke is no longer regent

while she was thus reproaching them for
their unfihal behaviour duke murdoch himself
came hastily into the room with letters in
his hand his face was pale and his limbs
troubled and a flush betokening aa much 
shtfow as alarm was on his cheek
 now he cried ye intemperate qnrits
now shall ye prote the difference between a
kia and a fathers
 the spaewife
what has befallen us said the duchess
moderating the agitation with which but a
minute before she had been so shaken
their brother walter replied the duke
with a sigh has been this morning arrested
and sent a prisoner to the bass
the two young princes looked at each
other their mother for some time was unable
to speak but at last giving a deep sigh she
laid her hand upon her lord's and said 
alas murdoch these are not tidings
which should make us renew the quarrels 
our hearth o hasten with what speed you
can to the king make all submission go
my dear sons go with your father and by
your humility disarm the force the blast
that so threatens to break us down
what exclaimed the lord james
would you have us drop like fascinated
larks into the adder's mouth 
the afflicted duchess at hearing this and
seeing her two sons conferring together with
the space wife sh
fierce and resolute countenances began towring
her hands and to pace the floor and
weep very bitterly crying
 o my prophetic heart has long foreseen
all thisbe and turning to the duke who was
standing very disconsolately ruminating with
the letters in his hand she said with a pathetic
but reproachful voice o thou rash
jephthah by thy vow to recall the king behold
our dear walter must be sacrificedo
the terrible justice this king it will make
me a childless mother v
the old afflicted father looked at her and
shook his grey head as he said
 alas isabella how often did you urge
me to get the king recalled and how much
did you rejoice when the states ratified the
treaty for his ransom the very act that deprived
me the power to protect our chill
trent
my joy replied the duchess still grievously
weeping was without reason oh it
cs
 the paewii
has proved but an omen woe it was a
light like that false morning which dawns in
the north and is never followed by any
day but only with storms and calamities

 come with me said duke murdoch
turning in sorrow from the duchess let
us go to scone and do what we can to appease
the displeasure the king
were you regent scotland cried
lord james and will you cringe and be
spurned 
lord alexander was however touched by
the extreme misery his mother and said
he would accompany his father which so exasperated
the choler his brother that he
cried hoarsely with raged
as you will spaniel but my resolution
is taken and with that he quitted the
room and mounting his horse immediately
left the castle scarcely was he gone when
there arose a great cry and panic in the court
the paewifb 
for a moment caused a pause in the
lamentations the duchess
 what has happened cried the duke
fiom a window but before he received any
answer the warder the castle and several
dicers rushed into the room the duchess
saw that some dreadful thing had come to
pass and gathering all her strength she dried
her tears and calmly inquired the cause 
their alan
council
 borough town or by chapter churchmen
convened on purpose they all went faaek
to the hall ad when the lord james entered
preceded by the bidiop and followed by
the chieftains there was x joy a skirling
and screaming bagpipes dreadful to hear
and wonderful to tell as if the vehement
pipers had each neath his arm some desperate
beast prey in the pangs and anguish 
being squeezed to death
the lord james bdusig seated on tl
right hand the bishop a merle horn with
a silver brim was set before him mi a fip
pie cup adorned with brabant carving was
also set before the bishop sand there was lily
the spbwifs t
wise placed between then a pewter guaidevine
 cypress bawbee the fragrant scent whereof
was itself as biiop finlay sidd a regale
fit fut it waa
a wall goodly masonry strong and his
and pierced m many places with holes for
the valiant men the clan to shoot therefrom
thir arrows and in this wall ihexe
was a gate with a bulwark at each sade very
fair to look upon and over the same waa a
loophole window for espial before opening the
gate to let strangers in
as kflhop finlay and his train drew near
some halfascore the glenfruins came to
the outside the gate very wild and
dreadful they were and they had round their
coins and cast over their shoulders a plaid
not skin but really weavers doric
though in likeness it was much similar to
the goatskins whereof the bishop's 
ware made and when they saw it was a
bishop and above all bishop finlay who
the spaewife 
had great reverence in those parts they threw
diemsdves on the ground before his shelty 
and as he was lifted from its back they kissed
ae hem his garment and he bestowed his
benediction upon them
then bishop finlay was led thorough the
gate into the court the castle wherein he
saw five cows chewing thor cute in a comer
behind a dunghill whereon divers swine grow
relied at their pleasure and hens and cock
were rampagina store for hospitality such
aa wel befitted the castleyard such a highland
chieftain and when he had looked around
and saw that there was indeed a competent
store victual in those living creatures for his
train he was right glad heart for all the
way thither he had thought what was said
concerning the spare feasts glenfruin and
w thereby much troubled in mind
from the foreeourt bishop finlay waa
conducted round the the turreted keep
 the castle and inwrought to a low and narrow
 the spaewife
door in a wall that was built from the corner
 the keep to the outer wau and having
stooped his head he entered in and found
himself in another court and before him a
stair which stood out from the keep but kd
to a door high in the wall thereof when
he had been conducted up the steps this
stair an old door which had been the half 
a gate that had suffered in some raid for it
was charred or burnt was laid from the
stairhead to the door in the keep and he
having passed over the same with some fear
stepped into the hall glenfruin
at the upper this hall in a vault x
pen a mighty fire was blazing and roaring
and before the same a pleasant sight as
bishop finlay thought there was the carcass
m the scorching fire where the
mast needed basting
this stripling was the young laird and
his instructor was the chief himself a
strong hale gruff and rough carle with a
bald head and a toosie grey beard he was
attired in plaiting divers odours which
his lady and her daughters and handmaids
had carded spun and woven and round him
he wore a spacious toga the like exhibited
the comer being buckled on his left shoulder
with ane broach as broad as the palm a
nuufs hand knobbed and gnarled with an
array glass beads and other similar precious
gems he had moreover a sword on
his thigh on the hilt whereof were many rich
carvings and cunning devices oversea work 
time which sword was among the clan accounted
worth twenty head the best cattle
ever lifted by them or their fathers from the
lands buchanan
s the spaewife
the stir and din caused by the entrance
at the bishop drew the eyes the chief
and those who were wiui him around the
hallfire towards the door and glenfruin
seing ikio was his victor advanced towards
him and greeted him in an hospitable manner
he which was the more to be remarked as
in those dies the chieftains wore prouder than
the bishops and many them could not
brook the privileges which the churchmen
aimed among their clans bishop finlay
however as is already rehearsed was much beloved
among the islanders for he meddled
not with their controversies nor put any interdiet
on their raids into the lowlands indeed
ccmiddering how much gear was thereby
brought into the highlands it would not
have been a wise thing unto have marred
lee hlnng hiaown trencher by counselling
compassion towards the amalekite as he was
wont in the cade halls to call the f aintplieart
ed lowlanders
tqb fabwife

after due interchange oi salutations the
chief led the way for the bishop to the foot
 a moveable timber stair so made that it
might be drawn up in suddai alarms or during
quarrelling in the hall and ascended the
slime followed by his guest and the young
chieftain
when they were about halfway up the
steps the old warrior happened to look down
and seeing who was coming after the prelate
he said to his son giving him a count on the

the part the castle into which glenfruin
led the way for the prelate was that which is
called in the saracenic tongue the harem in
the chamber up into which they ascended
the lady and her two daughters with the help
 an aged crone that fooled the manifold offices
 nurse and midwife to the family mistress
 the yam weaver the tartan and
chemist the potdyes were thriftily teazing
and garbling wool
in one comer stood a bed and inter it
with two large handles curiously fashioned
and adorned plainly great antiquity probably
one the chattels which the daughter 
godfridus macarkyll brought with her when
she married the ancestor glenfruin was
to be seen an ark or coffer with large brazen
the spaewife d
bands and massy clasps and a lock cunning
workmanship in this coffer all the treasures
and precious things were deposited which the
chiefs the glenfruins had gathered and
hoarded in the course many generations
raids and readings
at the foot the bed hung a bundle 
many leers harps and spindles worsted
yam divers hues a trophy and testimony 
the household thrift the lady glenfruin 
and on a shelf hard by the same lay a cheese
with two neighbourly wooden gardener
and a drinking horn with a brim graven
silver beneath this shelf was a costly oaken
elbowchair gnarled with flowery chiselwork
such as could not be surpassed for device and
intricacy in any lowland castle that age
how it came into the castle glenfruin
whether brought among the spoils some
bold adventure or purchased at the price 
lelieep and cattle lifted from the lands 
budianad were a vain thing now to deters
the spaewipe
mine there however it was the gxiaiidest 
all the moveables whereof the clan glenfrum
then stood possessed and near it was a table
with six legs each shapen into a coiifrmity
with the foot a dog there was likewise
in that lady's chamber two beaufort stools
and on pegs along the wall hung the mantles
and garments the lady and her two fair
daughters and swords that the chiefs the
race had taken from their foes in battle over
the chimney the familytree pedigrees
with all its branches hung depicted on ancient
vellum the lower part was so blackened
and shrivelled by time and the touch 
the kith and kin the family that no man
could tell from what obliviated root the glenfruits
had sprung
on entering the room the chief said
aloud the peeshop gilmore mi laidie
has come on a congregation with his benedictions
for te goose all our eowus and going
to the carved elbowchair before spoke 
tile spaewife 
he drew it to some distance from the wall
and turning to the prelate added pe
pleasured my lord peeshop to make a sederunt

bishop finlay so invited sat down
glens ruin then seated himself on one the
stools and the lady who had with her daughters
risen from the floor sat down on the
other while the young ladies found seats on
the bedside old nora after kissing the hem
 the right reverend father's garment
gathered the wool into her lap and retired
with it into an adjacent room
to bless on to pray was seldom any part 
bishop finlay's business and course he
was not at all times prepared to answer a call
for either but on this occasion seeing that
the pious chief the glenfruins regarded
his visit ad a pastoral advent he resolved to
look the difficulties the emergency bravely
in the face accordingly after a brief space
 time spent in silence and rumination he

turn for him
he reined his horse on the brow the
hill that overlooked the road and then alighted
and held itbjr the bridle his heart befit
thickly hitherto the spirit indignation
and revenge had animated him with fierce
resolutions and the sense the adversity
which had overtaken himself and the thought
 the ruin which hung over his father and
his father's friends had borne him above the
grief his condition but the ingot the
approaching cavalcade made um feel that his
situation was one too in which sorrow had a
heavy part
his first motion was to advance and mak
lumaelf known but without being aluaqslb
the paswife 
coqsdous the reason why he did so he had
suddenly leapt fnxn the saddle and he remained
irresolute with the bridle in his hand
till he was observed by one the gentlemen
oi the lady rose's retinue by that time
several his own train had seen the party
approaching and they came towards him
that they might be ready to assist or to obey
the attention the countess was directed
towards the spot where the lord james stood
and she halted her palfrey and raining her
right hand to skreen her eyes from the sun
looked up the hill for the space two or three
minutes without speaking
she then called one her servants to send
him forward to inquire who the strange was
at seemed disposed to interrupt her progress
 for so she interpreted the attitude and
mention the lord james from the numbers
and haste his followers assembling
from all parts the hill but her train had
quickly discovered that it was the outlawed
id the sfaewil
prince and the man whom she had sura
umxned to send forward knowing the effect
thftt tears would have on the iady sicilia
isfamied the countess in a whisper that it
was her betrothed bridegroom
for a moment the lady boss wist not iat
to do but after a short reflection she ordered
the servant to ride tip to the lord james
and tell him to come to her at the same
moment bidding the lady sibiua remain
where she was she touched her grey palfrey
and ambled forward to a distance attended
say by two gentlemen whom she ordered
to remain apart as the lord james jchued
her
what do you intend by this said the
countess fswteij you can never think 
involving a lady whom you have professed to
love in the present ruin and jeopardy 
your fortunes i entreat you james stuart
not to exaqpemle by any new outrage the
kkigs justice which is already sufficiently
t sfabwifs ill
soused against the house albany but
avow us to pass unmolested wsibiuas griefs
are more than sloan well bear do for the
mercy heaven and the sake the hesse
virgin retire and let us pursue our journey
in peace
 change alone replied the lord james
has thrown me in your way but what you
say sibillas sorrow is reason enough to
make me stop you it is for me and oi my
account thai she is grieved and i cannot asa
knight and nobleman but desire to lighten
her griefs
truly it is a kind way to do it replied
the countess you would console her by
adding to those offences which have brought
on the proceedings that have withered her
hopes be you assured that the king is
much more likely to pardon treason against
himself than the abduction a lady s
raiik but my lord you shall not
take her from mmy train is in bravery and
 the spaewifs
numbers more than equal to yours in so
saying the countess waved her hand and ina
moment all the gallants and servants 
her retinue were around her like a whirlwind
the damsels who were left behind screamed
and flocked towards sibilla where they a
lhted from their horses and assisted her
also to alight
the train the lord james had followed
him with anxious eyes and seeing him thus
suddenly in the power strangers they instinctively
thought that the readiest way 
extricating him from the danger into which
he had fallen was to make towards the defenceless
ladies conceiving that by so doing
they would probably draw off the main part
 the guard by whom he was surrounded
and thereby afford him a chance to escape 
 you have been rash lady's said the
lord james when he found himself environed
by her train on all sides i meant
you no harm and surely my concern for sithe
spaewife 
bill to whom i have caused as you say so
much sorrow ought not to have been thus

 said the countess with hesitation
 undoubtedly rqphed the lord james
eagerly and be desired a genllenuui the
guard by whom he was surrounded to go for
one his men
when this storm has blown oversee said
he addressing himself again to the countess
 bunely macdonald iu allow the marriage
toproeeed
it is broken off for the present refdl
the counts coldly the spabwif
whereat the king in person should preside in
his regal estate
in coming forth from the councilchamber
after this austere resolution his majesty took
hold the earl atholl by the arm and
they walked together in the verdant meadows
that lie between the abbeypalace scone
and the swirling waters the river tay 
it was a pleasant afternoon and the greenventured
spring sat smiling in her arbour 
budding wands and interwoven boughs with
many a sweet blossom in her lap and a young
bird on her finger which she was teaching to
hop aid sing
while the king and his uncle the earl
were walking along sedately discoursing 
the cares which then oppressed the royal
mind and weighing in the scales discreet
reason the considerations that had prevailed
at the councilboard touching the high crimes
and misdemeanours duke murdoch family
his majesty would often st though i should myself lead the life 
vol i f
 tbe spaewife
a dog i will make the key keep the castle
and the bush protect the cow but it a
dreadful thing that the first my task should
require such severity towards my own kin r
 is your majesty then really resolved to
bring the prisoners to trial said atholl
with a look that betokened some lataat purpose
in the question but the king not heeding
his manner for he esteemed his uncle beyond
all his counsellors replied frankly
 is it not so decided can you doubt
it give me leave to say my lord that i
was not altogether content with you taay
had the duke done nothing else than stript
the crown the lands which he has squandered
on his partisans he had done enough
to deserve the heaviest punishment long
must the kingdom rue the consequences 
the poverty that he has entailed on your
kings he has not left us the means to reward
the fidelity a menial how shall weever
be able to keep in check the arrogance
ths pawif 
 a nobility so accustomed to rapine we
have nether the means to make it their interest
to serve us nor wherewithal to enforce
their allegiance yes mj lord i am resolved
to go on and i look to your able and
experienced wisdom for encouragement and
supports
 but surely replied the earl should
they be found guilty as i doubt not they
must it cannot be your majestys intention to
bring them to punishment 
why not exclaimed the king surprised
at the remark do you think that
out any consideration for the power their
friends or any foe i shall be afraid to do
my duty
 i but thought said athos humbly
 that as they are so near kin to your
majesty their lives might be spared
 they are not yet found guilty at least
according to law replied the king but
jf they were justice knows not propinquity
 the spaewife
the proceedings against them however shall
be open and before all the world no man
shall accuse mes in this stem business 
being actuated by malice or any other base
motive though the trial will perhaps bring
disgrace on our blood it shall yet be a proud
thing for scotland and a glorious vindication
 her longadvised justice
i cannot however but grieve for duke
murdoch said the earl with a sorrowful
cadence he is my coudn 
so is he mine interrupted the king
 and i grieve that he is so because he has
proved himself so bad a man and his vice
wants the grace bravery for it seems almost
questionable whether his weakness or
wickedness is most in fault the nation might
have pardoned his misrule but humanity
can never forgive the licentiousness in which
he has indulged his sons as a kinsman
my lord i have more cause to grieve
for them than you for by their deaths i
the spaewife 
xan gain nothing which may not be obtained
by the forfeiture their estates but you will
come so much nearer the throne
the countenance the earl changed at
the observation and he looked troubled and
cast down his eyes saying 
your majesty cannot suppose that any
consideration that kind would to me
lighten the thought the sad destiny which
inevitably awaits so many friends 
he would have proceeded to say something
still more calculated to win the king's
charitable interpretation the compassion
which he had shown throughout for the misfortunes
 the house albany but just at
that moment anniple dunblane rushed
from behind ahoybush nigh to where they
were then standing
king james was not only startled by this
sudden obtrusion but filled with wonder at
the wildness her small bright piercing eyes 
and his wonder grew to awe as she placed
 the spaewife
herself immediately before him and leaning
with both hands on a rude sapling which
served her for a stamp gazed steadily at him
for some time and then looked round to
atholl with an expression pleasure so
ghastly chapel and yet triumphant that the
king shuddered and hastily turned away
rom the contemplation an object too hideous
mystical and undaunted to be seen in
that mood without astonishment mingled with
horror
 she is a poor harmless naturalis said
the earl observing the revolting effect which
she had produced on the king but the
country folk regard her with superstitious re
terence
i do not wonder at their dread said his
majesty solemnly but come my lord let
us return to the palace
stop cried anniple and advancing upto
time king she laid her staff softly on his
shoulder as he moved away atholl surthe
spaewife 
prised at this bold familiarity ran forward
and pushed it off and at the same moment the
king who was not less amazed turned round
 stop james stuart she resumed dropping
the her staff on the ground
 what would you said the king willing
to indulge her infirmity and struck with
sore pity at the remnants beggary which
hung around but hid not the anatomy her
shrunken and withered form
 ye wear the crown and the velvet gown
cried anniple to his majesty and i have buta
blanket and a boodle but for all the lands 
badenoch atholl breadalbane strathern
and stratford i would change my build in
dunblane kirkyard for your bonny queenlady's
silken bower to dree die penance that
she maun dree
and wherefore would ye not said the
king however she gave no heed to the
question but dropping her eyes and speaking
to herself she murmured out
 the spaewife
 often i have sat on the town biaeheadi
and seen the reek o the happy tollhouses
and great my een sair that the illdeeds fairies
had made me to live and to be without any
kind mother and ofifcen in the bathe summer
nights when other weans were leaping wi
gladness at through the needlee and would
na let me play wi them i yearned to steal
some holy abbot s purse to buy myself a wee
singing sister or a brother but its weel
for me i may say now that i never had and
never can know the peril kith and king's
the earl athos whole frame was
shaken to so great a degree as she uttered this
disconsolate soliloquy that notwithstanding
the fascination with which such extreme
wretchedness had arrested the kings attention
he observed his emotion and said
 i wonder not she says so for the whole
country cannot but sorrow that i am forced
to proceed so cruelly against so many that
should have been my best friends
the spaewife 
the earl was unable to answer or was
perhaps prevented by his surprise at the freedom
with which anniple went close to the
king and raising his surcoat aside touched
him on many parts the body with her
finger
 what is this for said the king adding
to the earl let her alone my lord i am
not afraid any spells
 eightandtwenty bloody wounds i see
them all and the hands that bear the knives 
let me look at your's lord atholl exclaimed
anniple and suddenly grasping him
firmly by the right wrist she looked at his
hand and alternately at something about
the king
yours is not among them my lord
and she dropt the hand carelessly at that
moment two officers came hastily towards
them and anniple darted away
 messengers said one the officers
 have arrived from glasgow with tidings 
 th spaewife
a rebellion in lennox headed by the lord
james stuart and the bishop argyll
what already in such power exclaimed
the king you see my lord athos how
much our worthy kinsmen show themselves
deserving mercy this is the submission
you and others undertook the lord james
would send in but no mattersis quickness
in ill shall not outrun our justice let
us return to the palace and call the council
together again it is demanded us at
once to quench this treason and to bring the
other traitors to their audit else the wild woe
mans prediction may be too soon fulfilled
the spaewife 
chap nil
bot itwas not from the lord james stuart
and bishop finlay only that the king had
cause to fear adversaries in arms against his
determination to administer justice without
respect persons or kin all the adherents
 the house albany there was
not one so bold a spirit as the sir robert
gramme before spoken and no sooner
was it known that he had made his peace
by submission and had been delivered from
durance than he was expected to show himself
in his true colours and so it came to
pass for in the same hour in which he was released
from custody he began to plan devices
and stratagems to revenge the wrong wiugiv
in his own notion he had sustained and also
partly to show his gratitude for the manifest
 the spabwifb
favours which he had received at the hands
both the regent robert and duke
murdoch
 though a man singular obduracy in
his lawless undertakings and ruthless bold
and bloody beyond any other chieftain 
his time yet sir robert held the virtues 
friendship in such esteem that he used to say
 as it is the duty all men to support the sufferer
in a just cause so in like manner is it the
duty friends to stand by one another bethe
cause quarrel right or wrongs
his first endeavours were directed to
achieve the deliverance the lord walter
stuart from the bass where as it is already
told he had been sent on his arrest for secure
ward fmr the lord walter being a knight
 undaunted valour in enterprise stout 
heart strong dumb and dauntless in danger
it was thought no castle on the main land was
redoubtable enough to contain so subtle and
intrepid a spirit
the spaeife 
gramme was chiefly moved to think first 
the lord walter on account his offence
against the king having been a more open
and daring description than the treasons imputed
to his father and brothers many holy
churchmen had besides accused him riotous
extortions and sacrilegious pillage and gentlemen
 good ancestry charged him with irremediable
outrages in their familles moreover the
pious lady abbess the nunnery at north
berwick had with her own pen written to
bishop wardle st andrews that it was
not to be told what the lord walter stuart
and his reprobate companions had perpetrated
in her house
but as the bass stands far in the sea and
is difficult access from a boat save when
the winds are propitious gramme was for
some time perplexed to know in what manner
he could convey his mind and intents to the
prisoner at last he bethought him an
expedient very bold and perilous but the
 the spabwifk
more recommended to him by the bravery it
demanded
he hired at the south queensberry a faoiat
and mariners purposing as he gave out to
pass thither to frail and thence to st andrews
in fulfilment a vow which he had
made in prison as if it was a thing within the
compass chance that sir robert rkne
should have in sincerity ever any pilgrimage
 piety to perform and having embarked
therein the mariners spread the sidls lively
breeze was then blowing from the westward
and the boat rushed before the wind as if it
had been instinct with eagerness to reach her
port but as she approached inch edtfa
gramme began to feign afraid the waves
he that knew not what fear was and to picture
rising blasts and raging seas such as no man
in his right mind as he said ought that evening
to encounter by dint which and exhortations
following thereon he caused the
mariners to take shelter under the lea the
the spaewife 
idondy m the hope that the wind would m
the ecmrse the night abate for in vain did
they assure him there was no danger and represented
ths eirkcaldy was a safer haven
since he was not content to continue his voyage

under the eastern cliff inch keith they
lay tin the sun was set and the lights on the
shore and the stars in the tuft were kindled
the moon but four days old was setting in
the clouds over the pentlandhills and seemed
as if she was trailing from the sea a long
and rippled line cold and watery light for
though sir robert gramme still would maintain
that the waves were too rough for his
small bark to encounter the mariners saw
that they were but twinkling in the moonshine
like the wiping a running river
when the moon had sunk behind the hills
and the land lay black between the restless
sea and the starry sky gramme ordered the
sails to be again spread but when the maris
the spaewife
news as their course lay steered in towards the
coast fife he rose in wellacted displeasure
and accused them not only having lost their
way but making for the lothian coast
they protested that they could not be mistaken
that the darkness was not so thick but
they could discern the landmarks and beseeched
him to have confidence in their knowledge
and skill
he was not however to be appeased by their
protestations on the contrary the more they
controverted his opinion his anger waxed the
fiercer and he insisted that if they would not
go on as he ordered they should return
they told him it was then too late to return
for the tide was drifting down but at
last by oaths and imprecations they were induced
to keep more out in a southerly course
to sea and towards morning the bass isle
grey and dark was seen rising over the starboard
before them
gramme affected great alarm when he beheld
the spaewife 
the lofty rugged cliffs and heard the heavy
noise the dashing sea and the clouds
 the cawing seabird that hovered around
the rocks and he sullenly inquired as one
that fears the name the island to which
they had betrayed him
when they told him it was the bass he affected
for a time a wild and fearful perplexity
daring alas what shall become me 
have i been set free from the pleasant heights
 stirling but to be immured on these doleful
bocks p then he suddenly seemed to
recollect himself saying but sir patrick
warburton the constable is a true and loyal
knight i will tell him in what manner this
misfortune has come upon us steer therefore
to the landingplace i will crave his aid
the mariners well knew that there was
eminent hazard to all who dared to approach
that prisonisle when there was any person 
dignity incarcerated there and again would
fain have refused the order saying that
 the spaewife
ncmtth berwick was so hard by that he needed
not to go to the bass mt only to star
straight to that port he however drew
his sword and wounded one them in the
arm for daring disobedience to his commands
after the peril they had caused him to pass
and the jeopardy into which they had brought
him so the men became afraid and thinking
he was not in his right mind ceased to
reason with him but submitted themselves to
do whatsoever he desired accordingly he
having ordered them to make for the guiding
they lowered then sails and pled their
oars with great vigour and when the boat
was brought under the wall gramme made a
sad memorial to the guard what he had
suffered from his contumacious and unskilful
crew entreating the soldier to inform the constable
sir patrick warburton who he was
whence he had come and whither he was
going and to crave his hospitality until some
other bark could be obtained to take him to
th spabwife 
frail for farther than he had come be wcmld
not go save in stress need with mariners
so unpractised as he had found those to be
who had brought him thither
sir patrick warburton on hearing this
plausible tale much commiserated the misadventure
 the petitioner and came himself
to the port and very courteously invited
gramme to land telling him however that
from his orders he must necessity hold him
prisoner till he received instructions from the
king
i know replied gramme that you
cannot do otherwise and i am content to abide
with you it is indeed a thing not to bethought
that you sir patrick warburton
would let me go free knowing as doubtless
you do that i was so lately imprisoned on a
charge treason for as yet you cannot
have heard my pardons
sir patrick was much won by this seeming
frankness gramme and assured him that
 the spaewife
though he must hold him as a prisoner yet

should he be as free as himself and diet he
would do all things in his power to make him
pleasant pastime tiu an answer came to the
report the incident his arrival
 am i then the only prisoner cm the rock
that you purpose to entertain me with such
freedom p said gramme
no replied sir patrick it is not so 
the lord walter stuart is here
the lord walter stuart i exclaimed
gramme as if in great amaze is he not yet
at liberty i am grieved to hear that for you
know sir patrick we are near kin ancu
but he need not be told by what accident i
am here for it is not fit we should hold any
communion together it would be an ill
return for the king's grace to me were i to
hold any intercourse with one that stands so
justly under the cloud his royal displeasure

a
you speak sir robert gramme replied
the spaewife 
sir patrick as a gentleman and a true
knight who has received a great boon from
his majesty but there can be no harm in
visiting your kinsman in my presence in
sooth he has late begun to take his condition
much to heart and to fret impatiently at
his fortune
 nay sir patrick it must not be so i
will not offer myself to the company the
lord walter said gramme but you may
tell him that i am on the rock and it will be
cheering news i well know when he hears i
have been pardoned
thus with welldissembled policy as they
were ascending from the landingplace to the
castle did grssme gain upon the confidence
 the constable who was an aged knight 
unspotted honour and who executed his harsh
oibce in so mild a manner as to make captivity
appear beneath his power almost as gracious
as hospitality
 the spaewife
chap xiii
when sir patrick warburton had conducted
gramme into his own chamber in the castle
and ordered a repast to be set beare lum he
then went and told the lord walter bj
what accident his kinsman had been thrown
on the island on coming back to gramme
they fell into discourse concerning the events
 the time the constable informing his
wily guest many things which though he
knew well he yet affected not to know especially
in what related to the disgrace and disasters
that had fallen on the proud house 
albany
 beshrew me sir robert gramme said
sir patrick it is not kind nor courteous
 you to be so near your kinsman
and not visit him i shall offend no orthe
spaewife 
der in allowing you to see him for though
my prisoner i am not commanded to enforce
upon him any unusual restraint poor gentleman
 since he heard the rigorous arrest
 his father and brother he has begun to
droop apace i have told him how perforce
you have been driven hither 
indeed replied gramme you would
not thereby add to his comfort for knowing
the peril treason in which i so lately stood
myself he must have marvelled at leaning i
was here
not at all not at all said sir patrick
 at first he seemed a little surprised and
was thoughtful bqt he soon brightened and
begged that i would let you ccmie to him
it grieves me sir patrick haliburton
said the treacherous and wary gramme that
he should have made a request so indiscreet
what can he have to say to me that may
not be transmitted by you it would only
multiply the daxrs into wych he has fallen
 the spakwife
were we to hold any communion together
how does he bear with his prison though
to be incarcerated is great adversity to one 
such accustomed bodily activity yet is he
withal fortunate compared with the close
durance that his father suffers at carlavexock
inter sir ralph maxwell whose insolence
to all that come within the ward his
keys you doubtless must have often heard
as for edmonstone who had charge those
that were with me in stirling i vow to god
he has not the ruth a highland shore
he kept us apart m cells as if we had been
savage beasts not christian men and made
our dungeons echo with ijireats that he dun
not have breathed to his own fancy in the
free daylight
aye sir robert grammes replied the
governor we are all in our unisis too
prone to prove our power but surely itb
comes not the honour knighthood to exasperate
the griefs the defenceless for
the spajewife 
my part i think the least my duty as constable
 the bass is the safe custody the
unfortunate men committed to my care i
feel myself bound to employ all charities
wherewith anguish may be alleviated and
petition solaced to soften and sweeten the
hardships their lot truly it is to me sir
robert matter affliction that you will not
risk your galant kinsman but if you will
not go to his chamber with me you cannot
restrain me from bringing him hither it is a
grace that i cannot deny myself nay though
it may at this time move your displeasure i
am sure hereafter i shall stand the higher
for in your good opinions
with these words sir patrick warburton
clapped his hands thrice and an officer 
the guard coming into the room he said
 go to the lord walter stuart and entreat
for me the honour his presence nay
sir robert it must not be that you will go
away i pray you be seated again
vol i g
 the spaewife
on the appearance the officer grrseme
had risen seemingly with the intention retiring
but the earnest manner in whidb the
old knight addressed him laying at the saine
time his hand upon his arm and pressing
him with the familiarity good feuowfdp
into his chair obligated him to remain
during the time this hospitable contest
the officer with three men the gttaard proceeded
to the chamber where the lord waller
was confined and having delivered the courteous
message from the constable they retired
bringing him with them and entered the
room just at the moment when his idnimian had
resumed his seat and before sir patrick had
again taken his chair at the the board
hearing the clank arms approaching
the door which was presently thrown open
gramme looked round and beheld the officer
with a link in his hand ushering the prisoner
who came behind him from a long dark gallery
towering in the port and pride a
the spabwife 
nuubhoode three soldiers 
the obscurity his shadow their arms
gleaming dimly in the light and their fierce
visages scowling more fercdy half lighted
half hid as the troubled flame the link
teed in the currents the wind
six patrick warburton in homage to his
hlhjbom prisoner rose from his seat and
meme also rose but there was an eimess
in his manner that betrayed the animation 
some feeling far different from the respectfulness
 the aged constable
the officer on entering the room stepped
aside as the noble prisoner came forward and
the three soldiers filled the door
the lord walter stuart was thai in the
prone youthful vigour his stature was
majestical and his complexion tinged with
the dark blood his royal race was so
frighted with the ruddy hue health and
hardy pastimes that he was justly accounted
one the comeliest knights in all scots
the spaewife
land his eyes were ixmand brit and a
pleasant arrogance in his smile that bespoke
admiration and homage suited well with his
proud demeanour and manly beauty
being a prisoner he had neither dirk joeat
sword nor baton but he wore his breastplate
 brass inlaid with many a curious device 
silver representing thistles and fleursdeijas
lions and griffins and other honourable hang
imitations and pageantries arms and chivalry
his surcoat was green genoese
velvet lined with yellow silk and he wore a
costly ruff many folds adorned with oversea
embroidery round his neck and on his bead
a black gascon cap looped up over the riot
temple by a golden clasp fastened to a rich
knot garnets and other glittering stones
thixugh which an eaglets feather was stuck
as it were with a careless bravery
as he stepped towards the table he glance
ed aide significantly to game who apparently
with a cold indifference returned
the spaewife 
the salutation and he stretch out his hand
frankly to the constable and passing round
the board took a seat at his right hand
 i shall not know haliborton said he
 how to repay you for all these civilities 
but i did not expect from what you had
told me tliati should be permitted to 
so penitent a proselyte as my kind
cousin there
the taunt in this speech was deprived 
all office by the look with which it was expined
to greene who replied
 it cttmot be lord walter that you
iaiftgine i was not sorely grieved to hear
when freed from confinement myself you were
still a prisoner in this place but the accident
which obliged me to take refuge here was so
extraordinary that under all circumstances
you cannot my lord but acknowledge i
should have acted most unwisely both in respect
to your condition and my own had i in
any degree been forward to seek your com
 the pabwife
any sir patrick there will attest that i
gave to him good and sufficient reasons why
i ought not to vint you and if any ill henceforth
arise from our being brought in this
manner together i must be acquitted all
blame
 nobody will impute to sir robert gramme
any motive beyond what he professes replied
the prisoner with a smile that his kinsman
understood but i think courtesy might
have claimed on sadi an cordon something
from loyalty had you been in my place
and i in yours gramme i would not have so
stood on my loyalty however take your
own way am not the less obliged to our
kind host by no other name shall i ever recollect
him for diis little interlude to the
dulness imprisonment pray may i venture
to ask if you know aught my father
and brothers 
grseme looked towards sir patrick and
said i am not aware what questions may
the spaewife 
be answered but thofie who hear mess and he
threw his eyes towards the officer and soldiers
 will bear witness to the reluctance i have
had to this intenriew
niiy nay sir robert gweme cried the
unsuspecting jsiiit you are too chary in
all this you would make your noble kinsman
feel the thraldom his condition more
sharply than there is any need what he
has inquired becomes him as a christian man
i beseech you sir robert to call to mind
tint there are no prisoners my board whatever
there may be in my custody here i
esteem you as honourable guests so use your
pleasure and he motioned to the officer to
retire with the guard
greene then repeated in a manner purposely
not so dear as he had received it from
six patrick all that the worthy knight had
told him convening the duke and the lord
alexander
 but have you heard nothing my bro
 the spaewifb
ther james what has become him f how
has he escaped or why is he spared cried
the prisoner eagerly
 it was reported at stirling said gree
 i know not how truly that he was in lennox
gathering the vassal your grandfather
this however was but a report a mere report
 what avail would it prove even
were it true 
every thing exclaimed the lord walter
exultingly if the old spirit the scottish
barons be not quenched it will teach
this new king charters and statutes what
it is to treat so many the notnuty like
hopeless varlet i am proud to hear such
bravery my brother but it makes me feel
what it is to be a prisoner
 i must not my lord listen to such ope
approbation rebellion replied gramme soberly
 and sir patrick will do me the justice
to remember how willingly i would have
avoided the topic
the spaewife 
 truljr my lord said sir patrick to his
prisoner it is too bold to say so much
at this crime the conversation a bell
without was heard at the sound which
sir patrick started up and said it is the
annal a barge from canty bay and i must
leave you for a few minutes
 this must not be sir patrick exclaimed
gramme hastily rising i will not be left
alone with the prisoner such a thing in these
jealous times might entail ruin upon us all
i will nevertheless hazard it said the
old knight laughing i rely on your honour
sir robert and what have i to fear 
so hastily quitting the room he left them together
the moment the door was shut
the ford walter threw himself into the arms
 hit kinsman and embraced him with ardour
and delight
hush and be calm said gramme we
have no time for protestations we must act
and that alertly i doubt not that by to
g
 the spaewife
morrow orders will be received to set me
ashore
eavanoe the officer with the fair sibilla
in his arms coming galloping to the castle
roused the retainers within and the walls
were msoned and a numerous party sallied
forth to aid their claasmi the ross men
at the fight this enforcement advancing
to the lennox men immediately retreated towards
their lady with whom they made all
pobsihie haste to dumbarton to implore sir
john stuiut dundonald the governor
to assist them to revenge the abduction and
outrage
the knight dundonald having a sharp
espial on aiuoch castle from the time when
the earl lennox waa arrested and knowing
that the force assembled there would not
contend with his in the open field was the
more easily persuaded by the countess 
 the paewifb
bonis to undertake the recovery her fair
niece and accordingly it was determined
that with a party his own men and the
gentlemen her train he should proceed the
same evening to bauoch and demand the
restitution the lady sicilia
now it came to pass that sara after this enterprise
had been so converted bishop finlay
reached dumbarton and riding straight to
the castlegate alighted and ascended to the
chamber where the knight was consoling
the seeing and afflicted countess there
he presently won favour and confidence by
the tale which he had contrived and sir
jcn stuart greatly commended his zeal and
loyalty and told him all that he had himself
resolved to do that night to revenge the
wrong done to the lady silnlla and the
contempt which had been shown to the kings
authority
wh the bold prelate heard this be cogitated
thereon and discerning that the gar
the spaewife 
risen the town and castle would be so
weakened by the force which the knight
intended to take with him to ballot that
they both might be easily won he bethought
himsdf sending wcxrd to the lord james
thereof and ako by magnifying the power
at ballot to induce sir john to make the
garrison he intended to leave still weaker ac
cording while sitting filii him and the
disconsolate countess he began to descant 
die wonderful hardihood the lennox men
and the invincible intrepidity and fearless
dexterity all the sons the duke albany
dwelling much on the prowess and bravery
 the lord james in particular to all
which the countess boas in the delirium
 her grief and panic bore exaggerated testimony
and so wrought on the grosvenor
that he resolved to leave the town and fortress
in a manner defenceless for that night
when bkhcp finlay perceived his insinuations
doric to such effect he feigned himself
c the spaewife
to be more weary by his dayes hard journey
that he in truth waa and retired forth the
castle to the carthusian college under pretext
oi abiding with the brethren till the troubles
in that part the country were so assuaged
that he might tray in peace and safety to
loobnluu but be was not loi within the
walls id the colkge when he called belbre
him friar mungo a sturdy and bold servitor
 whose address he had en other adventurous
occasions made probation and to him he
thus broke his nnndu
 you know brother muio that it i not
befitting mei our peaceful calling to meddle
with secularities and that i have ever as far
as in me lay set my face again all open or
occult correspondence wide wicked and evil
diqfioaed persons whether the lord james
stuart is a youth that character i know
not but i would fain spare the eflpuaion 
blood and therefore brother mungo you
will do a christian office if in your own
the spaewipb 
discreet way you will go to attach and tell
him that the knight dundonald with the
roes men intends this night to demand writhe
min part all the power now in dumbarton
the restoration the lady sibbla macdonald
to the eiiie cf her aunt the countess 
road and that if he is found in the castle he
may be taken therefore my counsel to him
is tomakeprepaiation mstanter to ocmie tome
hm while sir john is on his way to seek
him and i doubt not i shall be able to show
him how he ought to comport himself in diis
emergeiiey
friar mungo greatly lauded the christian
mind and temper the bidiop and implied
with a smihi cottntisnance
 it is a blessed badness my lord bishop
and i should lack religious grace were i
not to stir in it with an alert spirit be assured
my lcml i whl lose no time till i have
delivered your pious foundlings and ghostly
admonitions to the lord james stuart for he
 the paewipe
stands in die peril being an instrument
 great slaughter among his enemies who
though they be the adversaries his father
louise have yet souls to be saved and i
wl learn before i set off what road sir
holm tends to take that i may advise the
lennox men to keep aiiodier road for were
they to meet alas my lord there would
be an effiinon blood which might go well
nigh to break the heart oi the holy virgin
and greatly dkturb the beatitude the saints
that are with her in paradise
you have a worthy compassion brother
mungo replied the bishop and i doubt
not you dial be prospered in this good work 
but i am concerned to think what may happen
to the lady sibilla macdonald poor
tender young flower t did you ever see her
brother mungo 
 often my lord bishops exclaimed the
friar with fervour she is the most peerless
maiden i ever set eyes upon the splendour
the spaewife 
 her beauty is most ravishing to bdiokl 
her neck is using ivory and her bosom
my lord bishop 
 i thought brother mungo that there
must have been some cause for this animal
eagerness in the lord james said bidiop
finlay gravely and she is indeed so very
beautiful
 o verily my lord her presence lends
warmth to the air she moves in
v friar mungo would have continued to expatiate
still more sagaciously on the blooming
maidenhood the lady sibiua had not
bishc finlay in a tenderhearted manner
said he thought it would be a most nous
duty to rescue her from the danger into which
she had fallen
 could not you brother mungo said he
 contrive to get her transported from ballot
to the bower in inchmurin thither i would
go myself and endeavour to console har till
this feud is ended
 the spabwifil
 it is softly thoagfat replied the fnai
 and my pension with your request shall
not be wanting i will getmyself with her in
the boat and see hex safe upon tie islands
 no brother mnngo said the bishop 
 there canbe no need you to go with lor 
you must hasten back and let job know how
you speed
friar mimgo at these words withdrew not
the less eager to execute the duty wherewith
he had been aus misaioned by the command
to urge the lady sibilla rather to take refuge
in indtinurin where the earl lamas had
a summer bower than to return to her weeping
aunt the countess ross

the damsel after a short pause will it not

the countess made noreply but sat down
on aledgeof the rock and drawing her mantle
bse over her head rested her chin on her
hand and continued looking in the direct
by which the enemy was expected to come
sand began to ruminate and sigh which her
three maidens and the matron who was their
superior perceiving gathered around and began
to discourse with each others to comfort
themselves and to draw their mistress from

heavily oppressed

that was told me a poor outcast and ruined
sudden in a foreign land once at this terrible
hour after a woful course sin the sense

upon her that she went and laid her head on the

gentlewomen why on such a night as this
should i have had such cause to rebuke you
with such tales p yon stem and harsh sentinel
as he solitarily paces the wall is i
doubt not at this time ruminating more piteously
than you have done i knew an old
knight who had been in palestine and he
told me a fierce soldier whom he once on
visiting his post at midnight in a fortress
in the isle cyprus found weeping like
a child and on inquiring the cause such
singular tenderness in one his mettle he told
him that he had been thinking the time
when he was a playing boy with the freedom
 his father's house to which he could never
return and the remembrance had made him
sorrowful and yet ye who are women

chat the horrors a town sacked as glibly
as a seamstress some giggling girls incontinence

 hark hear ye that they are come v
exclaimed the damsels directing their eyes
towards the town the countess started
up and hastened to the wall where the
sentinel was walking he had stopped tor a
moment on hearing the wild cry which had
interrupted the countess but before she
reached him he was again slowly and with
his accustomed strides pacing the wall
 what think you was yon dreadful out
cryp said the countess and her gentlewomen
as it were with one voice
 i suppose the enemy has entered the
town said the veteran without halting or
altering his slow and measured pace
one the ladies went to question him more
particularly but his answers were gruff and
unsatisfactory
the spaewife 
it may be sir john stuart come back
said the countess to him
it may be replied the soldier but i
dolt think so
what is your reason for being that
opinion inquired the countess
you heard the cry as well as i did
every body might know what that meant
was the sentinels answer which he spoke in
the same rough manner and without altering
the regularity his step
 holy virgin what shall be our fate 
cried the elderly matron the superior the
countesses gentlewomen the soldier laughed
in scorn her terrors but another wild and
shrill shriek followed by a loud and trampling
sound and a continued cry and the sudden
extinction many the lights in the
town silenced for some time all farther parley
the sentinel stood still the women trembled
and the countess retiring a little way sat
down again on the rock and covered h ears
 the spaewife
with her hands to deafen herself from the
shouts and the raging noise and fearful cries
that every moment grew louder and wilder in
the town below
the work has begun said the sentinel
to the ladies and attempted again to pace the
wall as before but his steps were now sometimes
short and quick sometimes slow and
firm and now and then he halted and looked
and listened
i did not expect said he that the
town'sfolk would have made any resistance
it's brave them however
at that moment a loud and general shout
arose from another side the town opposite
to where the tumultuous noise had begun and
the soldier clapped his hands with joy and
cried our men have returned now the
rebels will have play for the game
scarcely had he said the word however
when a thick smoke arose in different parts 
the town and it was soon evident that the
the spaewife 
rebels had fired the thatch roofs several
houses
well i'm glad thisbe said the soldier 
they mean to let us see something
glad exclaimed the countess coming
again towards the rampart they have fired
the town i
they have replied the sentinel stepping
briskly out as the spreading flames sed a red
and dismal aught on mountain tower and
tree making the waters the leven and the
clyde seem as if they were blackness
mingled with fire
as the burning brightened the rage and
the roar the battle in the streets grew
fiercer and louder and the fighting was as
manifest as if it had been under the midday
sun the glimmer the swords in the light
 the flames was uke the sparkling from the
hammers a thousand forges and where the
brave burghers had bolted their doors and
fenced them within the lennox men battered
 the spaewife
with stakes limber the sound whereof was
as the sound many anvils amidst the crashing
 a sudden destruction
while the fighting was in its utmost fiirj
and the conflagration was rushing from house
to house and flapping its wings flame
as it were in triumph and exultation as roof
after roof sunk in under the gloomy towers
 smoke and fires that reached to the clouds
one the ladies by the glare the burning
which dismally lighted up all the sur
rounding country and showed the neighbouring
fields strewed with household goods and
troops women and children discovered the
king army from glasgow rapidly advancing
it was soon evident that the news the
royal approach was known in the town for
the lennox men began to flee in different
direeticmis and a bark that lay at anchor under
the castle was sei hastily unmoorii
the countess herself saw the lord james
and bishop finlay as it passed along standthe

which they had provoked and with which
their raid was so speedily overtaken

chap xviii
the lady sibilla after the departure annile
with friar mungo stood for some time
trembling with the timid fancies natural to a
young and delicate maiden left alone in a
dark and solitary place scarcely did she
venture to hope that she might be able to find
again the path by which she had been brought
from the castle nor was she willing to return
even could she have found it lest she should
fall into the hands sir john stuart to
remain in the gloomy wood till morning was
also very dismal to think for every stir she
heard around made her shudder and fancy
it the passaging some cold and crawling inhabitant
 the brake or fen but where or
which way could she go if she went farther
into the wood she might wander herself into
the spaewife 
greater dangers than those with which she
was already environed to walk the margent
 the lake seemed her only choice but when
morning was come what could she then do 
her fears swarmed as she ruminated and she
began to pace the shore in a very disconsolate
and wild manner unconsciously moving in
her distress farther and farther from the spot
where she stood at first till she approached
the banks the leven and was surprised
by the sound the rushing water near her
which she had not remarked before
she stopped and listened and while standing
on the river's brink she perceived a fiery
dawn kindling in the air and heard from
time to time the faroff sounds tumult and
commotion breaking through the stillness 
the night it was the battle and the burning
 dumbarton which she soon understood
and other thoughts and cares than
anxiety for herself then arising she hastened
down the rivers bank to see to listen and
 the gpakwife
to learn how it fared with the enterprise 
her lover
she bad not proceeded far when she discovered
by the dim blaze the distant conflagration
a boat fastened to the bank onboard
 which she quickly stepped and untying
the rope by which it was held allowed
herself to drift down the placid current
an eddy the stream however soon carried
the boat to the opposite side where the
bank being smooth and open she landed and
continued to hasten towards the town the
blazing roofs which had by this time awfully
lighted up the surrounding hills
while thus hurrying forward she fell in
with bands women and children flying
from the scene but to her inquiry they only
replied with their own terrors and alarms
and hastened sway they knew not whither
at last she came to a spot where an aged man
and his wife unable to travel farther had sat
down to rest themselves and the old man told
the sfaewife io
her with some moderation grief that the
lord james had entered the town but that
sir john stuart having come back soon after
the lennox men set fire to the houses and
were sacking and berrying without ruth remorse
or any touch human pity but his
wife was demented and ever and anon as she
watched the growth and repress the burning
she shrieked with the voice despair
and clapped her hands and bewailed the desertion
 their dwelling
the lady sibilla was note however long
permitted to condole with these unfortunate
persons for the rising flames being seen overall
the country a band the glenfruins
headed by their young chieftain came
down from the mountains to watch what
chance they might have spoil by hovering
on the skirts the town as aooia as akt
saw them draw near she was encouraged by
their appearance and making herself known
entreated to be conducted to a place safety
 the spaewife
where she might await the issue the contest
the young chieftain proud to aid so
highbon and so fair a lady readily acceded
to the request and proposed forthwith to
guide her to glenfruin but the night being
far spent and she was already so much harassed
by what she had endured as to be then
unable to undertake so long a journey therefore
he could only assist her to a smiling on the
neighbouring hills m which having spread a
couch plaids and heather he warded her
with his men without while she endeavoured
to compose herself to sleep within
meanwhile jpriar mungo after the abhorrence
with which he had cast anniple overboard
having sailed into the bosom the
lake found himself much perplexed he
durst not venture to return to ballot castle
lest he should find it in the possession the
knight dundonald and he bewildered
himself with vain guesses concerning the accident
for such he deemed it by which he
the spaewife 
had brought away the loathly spaewife instead
 the beautiful sibilla
in this perplexity as he at one time directed
the boatmen to make for inchmurin and
at another for the shore he too beheld the
reddening glare the burning town and
much aghast and apprehensive thereat he
knew not what course to take but was altogether
overwhelmed with anxieties and fears
in this state alarm and consternation he
happened to observe a glimmering light high
on the shore and inquiring where it was and
being told that it was in the castle glenruin
he resolved to go thither and address
himself to the hospitality the chieftain 
whom he had some knowledge and acquaintance
he was accordingly landed as nigh as
possible to the castle and reached the gate
shortly after the departure the young chieftain
on his expedition having made himself
known to the warder he was at once admitted
and guided into the hall where glen

fi the spaewife
ruin and four or fire his stalwart kinsmen
and guests were still sitting at the board and
engaged in a vehement controversy concerning
the exploits and pedigree the macfiurlane 
finoart a son whom had made matrimonial
overtures for one glenfruins daughters
a wooden stoup stood on the board
before them from which they as need required
filled a horn to refresh themselves
and the name the drink which they were
drinking came therefrom to be itself called
horn a word which in the language pf the
celts signifies the life feasts the visages
 glenfruin and his friends were shining and
flushed their eyelids were heavy but ths
eyes glittered and twinkled in a very lively
manner and the words their discourse
were cumbrous and often conglomerated in
the utterance
 sowlls and podies faider mungo said
the chieftain as the friar entered and will
ye be tere te night p sowlls and podies and

wfaar will ye pe travel sa ye te toun

a seat on a form by the fire was set tac
the visitor and a horn horn was filled
for him which he slightly tasted and
placed it at his elbow while one the corners
in the hall brought him some cold venison
for supper
while he was eating a lean and yellow
hand stretched from a dark corner behind
him took the horn away and presently replaced
it on the table glenfruin the only
person present who observed this looked
round with one his expressed oomphs
and a smile appeared to brighten amidst the
austere wrinkles his hard features like the
tufts the tardy verdure spring among
the seams and rents his native rocks
 sowlls and pods faider mungo said
 the spawe
he with a significant wink to his compeers
 is atobesurely that yeil no pe thinking

the friar took it up and in raising it to
his lips surprised to find it empty looked
shrewdly and queerly at glenfruin but the
chieftain without affecting to notice him exclaimed

 sowlls and podies i and yell no have gotten
a canker yet on saying whilk he took the
horn and filled it and while the friar resumed
his eating he placed it agaiji beside him and
looked round to the dark corner whence the
skinny hand had come forth and presently
the horn was again taken away and again replaced
as before
pe pleasured faider mungo said glenruin
 to tak te drink sowlls and podies 
we're al waiting forest faider mungo oomph
the friar again took hold the horn and
glancing his eye into it before raising it to his
mouth he smiled and seemed at a loss to unthe
spaewife 
understand what such a mysterious evasion 
the liquor portended
 sowus and podies faider mungo has
 te prone ta'en away al te horn oomph
brownie exclaimed the friar alarmed
jesu maria is there such a spirit about
this house 
oo aye it's a toleisurely tat we hae a
prone faider mungo oomph
before the friar had time to inquire farther
a loud and wild laugh behind made him
start aghast to the opposite side the fire
and in the same moment the spaewife came
forward into the light and made towards
him with outstretched arms to embrace him
in a facetious manner but suddenly pausing
as she advanced her gestures altered and
she bent forward and looked at him for a
short space and then turned away shuddering
with horror
 sowlls and podies anniple o dunplane 
exclaimed glenfruin rising from his seat in
 the sfaewife
evident term and will ye pe seeing wi te

anniple looking askance at the pale and
frightened friar and where it is and

and then she began to sing in her careless
heedless manners
and bold sir altar ht bent him down
and he drew his sword so bright
and wi ae flash ost through banes and brains
he deft the head o that knight
in the sequel it came to a hearing that
anniple who was in the practice roving
oyer the country and well known in consequence
both in town and tower had after
the friar so civilly threw her ashore gone
to glesf msnft gale and obtaining admifimcai
had made her quarters good in the castle
there were indeed few places where she was
mare reverenced than in the hall gli

from and she had but just gathered herself
up ito a knot in a comer behind the chief
to sleep when father mungo arrived it
also came to pass that glenfiruin disermog
there was some cause controversy between
the spaewife and the friar sifted them in
his own way by which he acquired at hist
some account the lady sibiuas abduction 
and suspecting that father mungo was more
in connexion with the rebels than he pretended
to be he addressed himself move particularly
to him leaving ahniple to retire
again to her comer

he was soon taught that neither remonstrance
nor supplication would avail

so ordered the glenfruins seized the unfortunate
friar and carrying him forth the
hall took him to the mouth a deep pit
into which they lowered him in a bucket to
the bottom where they left him for the night

chap xix
young glenfruin after placing a watch
round the shilling where the lady sibilla lay
sent down a party his men towards dumbarton
to learn how the battle had ended
and about sunrise they returned with the tidings
 the arrival the king the ruin 
the rebels and the flight the lord james
and bishop finlay in an irish bark for 

while the men were relating the news the
lady came out her lowly shed relieved
from the feverish embraces a troubled
and dreamy sleep by the dissonance their
tongues as they told their tidings
when informed what had come to pass
she stood for some time pensive and silent
and hung her head as if her heart had been
 the spaewife
wrung and her spirit sick she then sat down
on the thymy bank and covered her face
with her gentle hand and sighed and began
to weep the men who were with glenfruin
retired to a distance reverencing her sadness 
but the young chieftain hung over her and
wist not what to say or do to console h extreme
sorrow
after some time she became more composed
and rising from the ground she looked
towards the town whereof but the ruins lay
smoking around the foot the castle and
the tears dried on her cheeks and her beauty
became stem and there was soon on her lip
and ire in the flashes that lightened from those
eyes which hitherto had beamed so brightly
with the light love this war is not ended
said she to herself and she looked round
and eyed the young glenfruin as if measuring
the zeal and bravery his character 
but in another moment she averted her eyes
and looked to the town and again sat down
the spaewii 
on the ground and nourished the revenge
iirliicii ives newborn to her bosom
seeing how much she was stated with a
vehement struggle the young chieftain felt
himself abashed and retired towards his men
he was awed by her august nxien and the
fortitude with which she contended with herself
scarcely however had he left her when
she turned towards him and with a smile that
was meant to be gracious but which die vengeful
pride her spirit darkened as the eclipse
does the lustre the moon she waved her
hand and beckoned him to draw near
 though i cannot doubt said she that
the countess ross is with the king and
that immediate search will be made for me
yet will i not go to her but still proceed
with you to the castle where when i have
conferred with your father haply i may require
your service and she smiled upon
him again in so meek and gentle a mood that
the wish she had expressed was felt as a com
s the spaewife
and which he could not but obey nor indeed
was he sparing oi his assurances to do
all by art or arm that she might be pleased
to require him to perform
to this youthful ardour she made no ready 
but prepared to go with him to the castle 
and though sometimes in the journey along
the sides the hills she endeavoured to
discourse with him light and indifferent
themes her thoughts ever wandered to the
blasted fortunes her loversometimes she
lingered behind and melted into tears and
sometimes her step became proud and her
carriage resolute and she pressed forward
with the dauntless spirit df the lords the
isles
the young chieftain as soon as she intimated
her intention stul going with him to
the castle sent forward a messenger to apprise
his father that the daughter macdonald
was approaching in order that all
might be duly in readiness for the reception
tins pawife 
 o honourable a guest thus it happened
that when they ascended the hill on which the
castle stood glenfruin himself with his wife
and daughters and all the inhabitants his
hall were marshland before the castlegate
in their gayest attire
lady glenfruin and her two daughters
stood with their fingers daintily pressing their
bosoms and with erect heads and visages endeavouring
to smile they solemnly sank themselves
down to the ground and pausing for a
moment in the elaboration their homage
they then slowly ascended into the stately
steadfastness their first position the chieftain
himself advanced cap in hand to meet
the lady sibilla and brushing the ground
with his bonnet as he bowed in giving her welcome
said
 if s a consternation pleasantries mi
ladies that ye will pe coming al pe yourself

clanfruin in saying which he glanced

with a majestical eye to the magnificent castle

oomph
the lady sibilla paused for a moment
and looked around with a disconsolate eye on
all that scene their utmost grandeur which
the glenfruins exhibited but quickly subduing
the anguish the moment she replied
to the chieftains courtesy
 i doubt not glenfruin that you have
heard what has befallen mebut my either
duster among highlanders can only
find friends my desire is to be assisted back to
the queen and i throw myself glenfruin

the golden ore glenfruin's character
lady sibilla soon perceived and at the conclusion
 this speech she laid her hand in

his wife and daughter while he returned to
execute the business the morning in the

the speed wherewith the king had gathered
his forces and marched to quench the rebellion
in lennox before it was well kindled
struck such terror into the faction the
house albany that even sir robert grasse
was smitten with an amazement that for a
time took from him all power to prepare any
plan so strange a thing was it then in scotland
to see the government advance itself without
regard to persons or partialities being liberated
from the bass isle on the second day
after the lord walter was removed therefrom
by the herald to stirling he heard with
consternation that the king had marched
against the lord james and bishop finland
that notwithstanding the great head it
was rumoured they were making and which
the spaewife 
their friends magnified to intimidate their adversaries
had none slackened the orders given
to bring duke murdoch with his sons and
the earl lennox to judgment so much
indeed was grasse confounded by such resolution
and alacrity that when put on shore
at north berwick he lingered there forgetful
 the tale the pilgrimage which he had
published to disguise the intent the voyage
hat brought him to the bass nor thought
lie the suspicion which he thereby caused
to breed against himself but only felt the
frustration his stratagem as a new incitement
to revenge till awakened from his wonder
by the news the total discomfiture the
rebels at dumbarton the which nens taught
him it would be an ineffectual adventure to
attempt at that time any enterprise for the
deliverance the prisoners he therefore resolved
to await in quietude the issue their
trial and accordingly next day saved for
scrawl and performed his pilgrimage to the
k
 the paewife
shrine st rule in st andrews in a very
exemplary manner
meanwhile the lady sibiqa under the pros
teetichi glenfruin himsdf was conveyed to
soone where the queen had been left her
purpose in going thither was to work upon
the benignant spirit her majesty to the
 that she might endeavour with all her
blandishments to mitigate the kings anger
against the house albany especially towards
the boldest offender in its treasons her
lover the lord jaipes
whi she arrived at the abbeypalace the
queen was walking in the garden with one 
her ladie and she immediately went to join
her there but as she approached the spot
the thought what she had undertaken the
fears and the doubts the reception she might
meet with for so far overstepping the modesty
 maidenhood in applying as the declared
bride and advocate an outlaw made her
hesitate to advance for although queen jothe
sbaewlfe sfl
anna was a null and gracious nature
and much inclined by the gentleness ber
own heart to entertain all solicitations mercy
and charity yet was she so strict and pure in
the decorum her sex that'll returned few
faults more rigidly than those which by
their boldness seemed unbefitting the diffidence
that is so comely in woman
at the time when the lady silnlla entered
the garden her majesty was standing with
that renowned maiden and gentlewoman the
fair katherine douglas and very gaily attired
as her custom ever was in order that
she might by example teach the ladies and
dames the realm to acquire those habits 
courtly manners which are put on with the garments
 ceremony her goldai hair was gathered
within a net pearls adorned with a
specious ruby and many a sapphire and
emerald on her brow she wore a chaplet 
cet and white and blue feathers sprinkled
all over wiui spangles and intermingled with
xs the spaewife
jonquilles and sprigs broom around the
fair enamel her neck was a golden chin
from which depended a ruby shapen like a
heart which as it lay on the ivory her
bosom seemed as if a living fire had been
taken from the altar true love and laid to
beam and glow in that beauteous place by
the one hand she held her robe lustrous
satin loosely up from the dewy grass and
with the other she leant upon the shoulder 
katherine douglas smiling on the flowers
timidly peering from their buds as it were to
see if the spring was indeed come again
a little page who accompanied the lady
sibilla into the garden perceiving her hesitation
went forward and told the queen her
arrival and her majesty dropping the train
 her robe came quickly to meet her and taking
her by the two hands not only prevented
her from performing the accustomed homage
 kneeling but kissed her in a sisterly manner
on the cheek then drawing one her hands
the spaewife 
gently through her arm she waved to katherine
douglas to retire and led her to a bower where
they sat down together but notwithstanding
all this tenderness and ardour sibilla was unable
to speak till her heart was relieved by weeping
at last encouraged by the soothing sisterliness
 the queen to break the business cm
which she had returned to scone she related
the accident her adventure at ballot
and thence took occasion to remind her majesty
how natural it was for her to sorrow
and deplore the ruin which impended over
the house albany
 alas madame said she duke murdoch
is a man whose simplicity is his greatest
fault he is without guile and altogether
disposed to be harmleira and kind and good
and which is the better part goodness
to think well every body without adverting
to their humour affection or pres
judices he cannot have done ill but as an
instrument in the hands others
 the spaewife
 then is theresa replied the queen the
less cause to fear that he will suffer ans greater
penalty than the arrest under which he
now lies for it cannot be that were heund
guilty the king would bring so near a kinsman
and so great a man in old age to any
heavier punishment so be not cast down on
his account
 but if your majesty knew the duchess
said sibilla 
 i have heard great things that noble
lady's replied the queen and i have marvelled
that she has never some to see me
 she is indeed exclaimed bibilla the
paragon mothers that she comes not to
court is natural considering how she herself
was so long all but in name the queen it
may be the infirmity our sex that she
is loath to appear less than she was albeit
i do not think so bit rather that it proceeds
from the very excellence her character
knowing as she does that the duke
the spaewife 
from his easy nature may have fallen into
fault and grieving for those things in b
soon which however old as the free usages
 the scottish nobles accord not with the
milder customs that the king so labours to
establish she can have no heart to be at
court where the show that reverence which
her wisdom would instruct her to pay to his
majesty and your royal self might be considered
with jealousy as assumed to win indulgence
for her children but were any

grace dispensed towards them i know from
the warmth her affections that the winds
would be slow to the speed wherewith she
would seek to testify her gratitude by throwing
herself at your majesty's feet
 then said the queen rest you assured
that i shall not fail to urge the king
so to appease the rigour justice as to bring
speedily such an ornament womankind to
his oourt
the lady sibilla was for that time content
 the spaewife
with this assurance and their discourse began
to be a less earnest kind
know you sibilla said the queen
 that our young kinsman the iord robert
stuart nephew and heir to the earl holland
who has but lately for the first time
come to court speaks you with the zeal 
a worshipper i would it might be sibilla
that you were free to choose he is the
handsomest gallant that i have yet seen in
scotland there is not one who either for
carriage spirit or courtesy may complete
with him and not less highly bon than the
sons the duke albany
sibilla blushed and for a short time made
no reply then she said softly
does your majesty forget that i was betrothed
to the lord james and that but
for this unhappy distraction fortune which
has driven him to such extremity we should
have been married i may not think any
other
the spaewife 
u
nay replied the queen it cannot
be that you should know the very excellent
qualities stuart and not prefer him there
is not a nobleman his years whom the
king so esteems as a companions
sibilla again became thoughtful which the
queen observing took her by the hand and
said
 i doubt not that his majesty could easily
obtain from the popes holiness a dispensation
to dissolve the contract by which in nonage
you were so unfortunately betrothed to the
lord james i am told that neither his
brothers no not even the libertine lord
walter is less deserving your affection
he is they say the fiercest and proudest 
the three leave him to the issues his
fate and think what i have been telling
you concerning the adoration stuart
sibillas bosom heaved with sorrowful sighs
and the tears rushed into her eyes as she exclaimed

 the spaewife
 alas to what am i destined and she
shuddered and began to weep bitterly
the queen was much surprised to see
such violence grief but thinking it arose
from the persuasion which sibilla had the
truth what she was saying the lord
james she endeavoured to console her with
the assurance that the king would leave no
influence untried to procure a dissolution 
the contract
 oh it is not that which affects mes

cried sibilla with the sharp accents misery
but suddenly exerting herself she dried her
eyes and said i should have more pleasure
in knowing that the duchess albany anxieties
were softened by any grace to her family
than in being released from my bettotfament
to the lord james
the queen not perceiving the double sense
 these words renewed the assurances her
best and earliest endeavour to procure some
abatement the severe measures which were
the spaewife 
in process against the house albany add
ing but come i have no will had i the
power to rule one so discreet and wise as my
dear sibilla in any business the heart let
us therefore say no more it at present
but come to my chambers
so saying the queen rose and taking herby
the hand led her to the gate and they
ascended to the royal chamber where with
the other ladies the court they spent the
remainder the day with the tuneful jingle
 the virginal and melodious songs intermingled
with pleasant discourse

whisk the king had restored peace at dumbarton
he came to stirling where on the
night before the day appointed for the trial
 his uncle the duke albany with his
two sons and their maternal grandfather the
earl lennox he held a solemn council in
the castle at which the greatest and wisest
men then in all the realm met and a jury
consisting twentyone peers was nominated
 whom the earl atholl was the first
named being proposed by the king himself
 i implore your majesty said the alarmed
earl when his name was mentioned not
to put on me so invidious a duty think
how near i am kin to the accused men
will say if in my estimate the evidence that
may be brought against them i fall not in
the spaewife 
with the severity justice that i favour
them because our relationship and if i do
what justice may require and find them guilty
 their imputed treasons the opinion the
world will still go harsher against me for by
their condemnation i shall become presumptive
heir t the crown
all present applauded this speech and
seemed to expect that the king would consent
to dispense with the service the earl
at the trial but his majesty replied 
no my lord athos what you object
becomes that fame for wisdom which you enjoy
in the world but this awful business requires
the assertion an honour above the
world in so much as you act as you will
do with no respect for the opinions men
but only for truth will your name and renown
be exalted and spread abroad the
task that i call on you to perform is fraught
with an immensity glory for there has
not been from all the eras history so
s th spaewife
magnificent a vindication law and justice
as that which with the favour heaven we
have undertaken to see donee
the peers and prelates around the council
table were smitten with wonder at the voice
and manner with which the king spoke and
the earl rose up and solemnly laying his
hand on his bosom bowed in reverential silence
to his majesty and again slowly sat
down when the king added
 it is our intention to preside in person
and on the throne with crown and sceptre
the condition the prisoners and the greatness
ci the occasion demand it no man
with less than the dignity royal should sit
in judgment on a prince who has like the
duke administered the royal trust and
who is there that might not be suspected 
being factiously swayed against his graces
friends and family when it is considered that
the king has declared himself the avenger 
all such crimes and offences as those wherethe
spaewiffi 
with they are charged and shall moreover
by the forfeitures that may ensue from their
condemnation be so enriched with the means
to reward subserviency 
thus it was determined that not only
should the king preside at the trial and the
earl athos be at the head the jury
but that the jury itself should consist chiefly
 noblemen attached by interest and gratitude
to the party the prisoner so anxious
was his majesty that the world should never
have cause to impugn the stem sublimity 
his justice
but though the earl athos had in so
dutiful a manner submitted to the kings
command before the council his heart was
much troubled and when he retired to his
lodging in the town where his lady was he
appeared overcast with thought and care far
beyond his habitude the which had for sometime
before been singularly reserved and melancholia

 the spaewife
 why my dear lord do you keep yourself
so much late apart from all your
friends said the lady atholl and walk
in that manner with folded arms and knotted
brows as if you nursed the remembrance
 some insult or indignity 
 indignity t exclaimed the earl as if
the thing had been impossible
yes replied the countess i have 
late often remarked that you require more
than the usual homage from your servants
and i am afraid that you have had cause to
observe some abatement in their respect towards
you tell me i entreat you my dear
lord if i have in any thing given you offence
to cause you so to withhold from me
the confidence and love that we once and so
long enjoyed together
 it is impossible replied the earl that
i should not be disturbed by those feuds and
demonstrations rebellion which so distract
the country our young king lacks in the
the spaewife 
discretion which should be possessed with authority
he makes his power felt by its
pressure and bears himself onward in the
establishing laws which by being written
he regards as superior to the fluctuating wisdom
 common opinion without considering
whether the spirit the age goes along with
him he is like a warship that sails in unknown
waters reckless the sands and shoals
that may be concealed beneath the waves
and the sunken wrecks that lurk unseen
around prompt as it were with destiny and
perils
i thought said the countess that
you had approved all the steps which he
has taken to crush the insolence the albalies
 and surely we shall have no cause to
repine at whatever he may undertake against
them for by their overthrow our fortunes
will be advanced
peace margaret de barclay replied the
earl fretfully you meddle with affairs above
vol i l
m the spaewife
the concerns womenwhy should we seek
the advancement ourselves at the expense
 our kinsmen 
 nay heaven forbid we shoidd do any
such things exclaimed the countess but
were the family albany destroyed you
would then stand next to the kings
do you think that i cried the earl
would be art or part in any machination
for their destruction you know not what
the king has done to me today he has
required that i should head the jury on their
trials
 in that he may have had a care for
his own honoiu and your renowned said the
countess for i hope it cannot be thought
that you will either for your own advantage
or any other mans affection swerve
from that integrity which has won for you so
eminent a name
the earl made no immediate answer but
the spaewife 
paced the chamber thoughtfully with his
hands behind
 if resumed the countess the task
he has put upon you be greater than you feel
in yourself the power to accomplish i pray 
you my lord not to be enticed by any fantasy
whatsoever to persevere in its
the thing itself said the earl with a
seeming carelessness would not trouble me 
but who knows what the world may think
 ah my dear lcmd cried the countess
passionately if you did not suspect yourself
you would not so stand in awe the
world i do by our long cohabitation and
faithful love implore you not to embark in
this business since it is so equivocal to your
conscience
what do you mean what would you
imply exclaimed the earl startled by her
observation
 oh nothing nothing i what should i
imply derogatory to your honour said the
 the spaewife
countess and the tears rushing into her
eyes she wept very bitterly
i shall grow angry at such peevishness
margaret de barclay said the earl you
allow yourself to become fantastical and
with a paying jealousy alike unworthy 
yourself and me you put a false and unfavourable
colouring on my best intentions
good heavens you would insinuate that i
am plotting for the extinction the whole 
duke murdoch's line though all the world
knows that i alone the council opposed
myself to the proceedings which have now
arrived at such a portentous maturity
i do not blame you my lord replied
the afflicted lady with a mournful voice 
 but i fear that your honour is in great
jeopardy alas i can only pray that it
may with yourself escape the risks to which
it is exposed
the earl made no answer to this kind
ejaculation but retired from the room and
the spaewife 
went straight to the chamber in the castle
where the king was sitting alone pensively
looking over the wide landscape that spreads
towards all the west and after some interchange
 courtesies becoming their respective
conditions and made flexible by their
relationship and his majesty's favour they
discoursed the deliberations the day
and the impending solemnity the morrow
i fear said the earl speaking the
prisoners that they must all be found
guilty but your majesty will not teach the
irreverent world such a dreadful lesson as
that the sacred rank princes may be subjected
to the ignominy a public execution
 if they are found guilty the crimes
laid to their charge i will confirm the sentences
replied the king gravely i dare
not pardon them were i to be swayed by my
inclinations in this case and unjustly use
mercy what offender in scotland would hereafter
in receiving punishment be considered
 the spas wife
otherwise than as the victim a partialityfanny

the earl did not immediately make any
answer but after a short rumination he
said 
 in those eastern countries where wisdom
and light have their fountainhead it is said
that when illfated or guilty princes are condemned
to die no axe is ever stained with
their good but at the dead night a
solemn sound is heard pealing through the
silence all then asleep start from their beds
and listening at their windows hear afieur off
the dark and heavy plunge anne awful
thing cast into the seas
the king looked austerely at this uncle
and replied i trust to heaven my lord
that i shall ever be preserved from the practice
 any usage which makes justice so much
like crime therefore urge me no more but
let all things be done openly and before the
eyes god and man so that the purity 
the spaewife 
our conscience may be discerned in the clearness
 our actions
with this he went and sat down agdn in
the oriel window where he was sitting when
the earl entered and the latter came away
somewhat discomposed by the rebuke which
he had received but seemingly not inwardly
much disturbed that his majesty should
be so resolved to let the law take its course
against their delinquent kinsmen
 the spaewife
chap xxii
in the meantime the lady sibilla abiding
with the queen at scone saw and heard
day after day that no entreaty nor supplication
could move the king from his stem
intent to vindicate the laws the realm
and the regal authority and the hope which
she had cherished obtaining by the mediation
 her royal mistress some remission 
his severity began in consequence to wane
and fade and her spirit was overcast with
sadness and despondency
she however still thought that offended
justice would be appeased with the sacrifice
 one victim and she was almost content
when she heard that the lord walter was to
be brought first to trial she augured therefrom
that as it was the opinion all men he
the spajewife 
could not be tried without being condemned
the king would be satisfied with asserting the
supremacy the law over him only in respect
to those notour treasons and offences
wherewith he was charged accordingly for
several days before the time appointed for the
trial she refrained from soliciting the queens
favour and influence either for her fugitive
lover or for any the prisoners awaiting
the issue under clouds dread and terror
it is true but not so black in their darkness
as to shut out every star hope
the singular constancy mind with
which that delicate lady in the interval resisted
all enticements to pleasure and pastime
won the admiration the whole court 
for the motives and causes her abstinence
were well known and the ill success which
had attended her endeavours awakened commiseration
and sympathy in every gentle and
religious bosom it began however to be
remarked that her beauty was suffering a
l
s tale spaewife
change and that instead the bloom and
gaiety which was wont to beam in her eye
and smile on her cheek the harsh aspect 
resentment uke the shadow a cloud on the
summer fields often lowered in sternness
and that her voice lost the sweet melody 
persuasion and became harsh with the accents
as it were reproach and command
in vain did the countess ross who had
by this time returned to sooone chide her
frowardness and beseech her to retire for a
season to some secluded bower especially as
she had so openly declared her determination
not to go back to the castle her father till
the destiny her betrothed lover was decided
by the impending fate his father and
brothers
but what most drew the wonder the
courtiers and the ladies was the manner in
which amidst all her anxieties and visible sorrow
she comported herself towards the young
lord robert stuart after his return from
the spaewife 
dumbarton whither he had gone with the
king against the lord james
as often as he approached towards her she
was seen to shudder and become pale but
almost in the same moment by some escorting
 inward fortitude her countenance
was whitened and she welcomed him with
the apparent pleasure one solicitous 
vard
the queen observing this marvelled thereat
and also that sibiua at no time nor on
any occasion spoke to stuart the unfortunate
condition the princes the house
 albany but seemed as it were with a
singular solicitude to avoid all discourse and
controversy conversation concerning them
with him yet notwithstanding it was
plain to her majesty as well as to others
that she did some constraint to her own
nature in the affable carriage with which
she demeaned herself towards stuart even
stuart himself admiring her with the fervency
s the spaewife
 a fond and young enthusiasm felt that
there was something in her manner which
while it flattered yielded him no delight
when he was most ardent and emulous to
evince the sentiments with which he was
animated she listened with attention but it
was as if she endured some penalty the
spirit yet there were times when she would
as it were wave over him the gracious enchantment
 her happiest graces and make
him fancy that his affection was almost returned

if she looked cold and retired from his
impassioned advances he felt abashed and
mortified and in the eclipse hope which
took place on such occasions he remembered
with something like boding and dread the
admonition the spaewife with respect to
the influence that a lady was to exercise over
his destiny but when she wreathed her
smiles and charms as it were into a corded
garland wherewith he was too happy to be
the spaewipe 
fettered he pondered and dreamt but her
and worshipped no other saint
many however thought that both in the
frowns and the favours by which sibilla so
subdued stuart to become her declared
knight and servitor she was actuated by
some deeper motive than the feminine desire
 supremacy and perhaps it was that e
did discern qualities in his character which
she thought might prove avail in some
eventual and contingent purpose especially
as none all the young nobles enjoyed so
much the kings familiar regard or shared
so freely in his pastimes and exercises recreation

but time was running on and the day
appointed for the trial being come the queen
and her gentlewomen in the evening sat
lovingly in unison endeavouring with their
melodious lutes and virginals and the pithier
music discreet discourse to sooth sibilla
from the melancholia ruminations with
 the spaewife
which she was all that day depressed and
it came to pass while they were so engaged
in the royal chamber that stuart entered
hastily to tell the queen that a messenger
had arrived from stirling with the result 
the lord walter's trial
in coming into the room he chanced not
to observe sibilla among the ladies for the
setting sun so caused the purple and golden
hues the heraldries emblazoned on the
windows to fall as it were with the sprinklings
 a shivered rainbow upon all things
in the chamber that nothing therein could
 be distinctly seen at the first glance and he
bean to tell that the lord walter had been
found guilty the offences laid to his charge
and that he was immediately condemned to
die and had been forthwith executed on the
castlehill to the amazement the people
these sad tidings though not more terrible
than her fancy had long prepared sibill
to expect so smote her heart that she 
sfawif uss
i
tered a feeble cry and sunk down upon the
floor in a swoon from this sorrowful syncope
she was however speedily recovered by
the rationally cold water and the moment
that she could again speak she inquired
with a piercing sadness what was to
be done with the other prisoners
 alas r said stuart while he hung over
her himself almost insensible with anguish
and horror at the fearful accident he had
caused by his rashness alas said he
they are to be brought to trial tosorrow's
 then they too exclaimed sibilla are
no less assuredly the victims this inflexible
sternness in saying which she made a strong
effort to shake off the languor her trance 
and rising from the laps and arms the
ladies she suddenly quitted the chamber
the queen whose gentle nature was greatly
moved by her sorrow followed her hastily
into another room and began to offer many
 the spaewife
kind and tender suggestions to mitigate her
affliction to all which she only saide
i will this night go to the king himself
this work is too horrible i no measure 
justice can require the sacrifice a whole
race it is but the wrath heaven that
demands in one sacrifice so many victims
hitherto i have implored the beneficent mediation
 your majesty to obtain some ray 
the royal mercy for these unfortunate princes
but i will now speak to the king in another
strain
the queen was surprised at the manner in
which the lady sibilla thus delivered herself
for there was no tone grief in the
accent her voice nor any shadow sorrow
on her countenance but a serene solemnity
manifested alike in the lofty elevation 
her speech the calm her eye and the majestical
firmness her carriage
 i do not oppose your resolution sweet
cousin said her majesty after a short pause
the spaewife 
and thoughtful interval but i would remind
you whether such intrepidity in behalf
 the house albany may meet the approbation
 your own friends it is a new thing
for one so young to step so forward
 it is a new thing replied sibilla to
behold an illustrious line princes doomed
to be cut oif on the ignominious scaffold and
am not i involved in their fate by the strongest
 all ties by the affection that i was
encouraged to cherish an obligation with
which heaven itself united us i feel as a
daughter and sister the prisoners should
feel and as such i am irresistibly impelled to
stand forward in the thoroughfare the
death and desolation that are rushing in a
manner so terrible upon them my endeavours
may in nothing avail the victims but
i am the only friend that dares to adventure
any expedient endeavour in their behalf
the vehemence with which this was said
affected the queen's heart with a sorrowful
 the pabwife
anguish and her majesty refrained from offering
any further remonstrance but only h
gave orders to the officers her chamber to
see due preparations made for the conveyance
 the lady sibilla forthwith to stirling
and she specially enjoined stuart and other i
gallants the court to be her guard and
company

it was the grey morning before that mournful
lady reached the castlehill stirling
where she alighted from her palfrey and ascended
into the inner ward as she passed
towards the king's chambers she met the
earl athos coming from his apartment to
proceed with his majesty to the parliamenthall
where already many the nobles and
a vast multitude were assembled and the
earl was so startled and surprised at beholding
her thee at that hour leaning on the arm 
stuart that he could make no reply when
she entreated hin to conduct her even then
dishevelled as she was by her nocturnal journeys
to the royal presence
surely said she aloud it may not bethought
that the earl athos is consenting
to such an immolation his kinsmen i be

speech you my lord to obtain for me an
audience the king before this bloody work
is renewed it is for your own honour and
good name that his majesty should be counselled
to pause men will say if you do not
stand forth against these terrible proceedings 
that you have sordidly urged them on for
your own particular advancements
the countenance the earl grew dark
and he seemed as if he felt the pang some
inward sting f
i marvel lady said he that you so
freely vqtlue to set your feminine judgment
against the king's wisdom what his majesty
does he has great cause to do and as to
the opinion men with respect to me my
oaths my allegiance and my duty all alike
admonish me not to heed does your noble
father know the advent on which you have
come hither i doubt lady if he would
much approve such maidenly forwardness

the spaewife 
let it stand my lord between you and
your conscience as to the part you perform
and i will answer to my father for mine but
as i cape not hither for any controversy i
implore you to gain me admission to the
king 
that i would do lady sibilla with a
sincere heart and be glad to second your solicitations
were there any likelihood that your
advocacy would in aught avail but knowing
how the king's resolution is rivetted with the
determination to vindicate law and justice to
the very uttermost it would be a fallacious
thing to carry you into his presence and but
only serve to chafe him into displeasure against
us both
to this sibilla made no answer but despondingly
hung her head which stuart observing
said 
perchance lady it will not go so hard
with the prisoners today as it did yesterday
with the lord walter abide the issue 
 the spaewife
their trial and haply your mediation may then
prove more effect
silica looked at him for a moment with a
glance scorn and aversion but almost in the
same instant she overcame that movement 
indignation and trimming her eyes with smiles
replied 
i have pledged myself to a task i may
indeed say that i have undertaken the performance
 a vow and until i see the king
and hear his denial with mine own ears i
shall not be satirised that i have done all my
duty
 duty exclaimed the earl athos
aye duty you know that i am all butin
name the wife the lord james starts
father is as my father his brother as my
brother and until i have done my utmost to
avert the calamity that has fallen upon them
i shall be accounted wanting in filial reverence
and sisterly affection avert did i say alas
that is now impossible yesterdays lord walthe
spabwife 
ter suffered oh my lord if the king be
that good and just man which he is said to be
his justice however stem may well b appeased
by that princely victim therefore
i again beseech you to carry me before him
do me that small favour it is a suit which
may be conceded to the daughter macdonald
for any cause and at any time in such
a cause and at such time it is one that she will
not forego
i join my earnest entreaty said stuart
that you will do so much to satisfy the
lady sibilla you see my lord how her
heart is bent upon it and though her mediation
prove ineffectual yet it will be a consolatory
delight to her hereafter to think that she
did all yea more much more than all that
could have been expected her to lighten
the misfortunes such dear friends i want
indeed words to express my admiration 
the intrepidity with which so gentle a creature
has engaged in so bold an enterprises
 the spaewife
not bold but merciful exclaimed sibill
 i see friends in jeopardy and shall
i not strive to help them alas my lord
athos why do you so set yourself against me 
who will believe that the love justice alone
governs you in this matter f when the family
 albany are cut off you become heir to the
crown ah my lord why does your complexion
fly it is so and are you indeed
working out by this cruel justice an underground
passage to the throne st
 she rails said the earl aside to his nephew
 and i have no time to listen with
which words he moved to go away but sibilla
caught him by the skirt his surcoat as she
exclaimed
you shall not leave me so abruptly my
lord if you have that honesty which you so
well affect the rave my distraction will
bear no offence in it in sooth i will take no
denial the bravery my fathers has tempered
my spirit for this undertaking and i
the spaewife 
shall not be resisted in my resolution to seethe
king
while she was thus importunately urging
her suit a stir and a noise was heard which
announced the king's approach
first came the heralds with their batons
and mantles anon the lords the privy
chamber then the earl ross bearing the
sceptre followed by the earl angus carrying
the crown his majesty came after
alone at some distance his train borne by two
fair young pages
as the earl ross who was uncle to
sibilla came forward she shrunk back for a
moment but her resolution soon overcame
that hesitation maiden diffidence in so much
that when he passed by she met the surprise
with which he gazed on her as if dbe knew
him not or was so rapt in some high contemplation
as not to be sensible to the transitory
pageant then moving before her
her eyes were intensely fixed on the king 
vol i m
 the spaewi
and as he drew near she cast herself at his
feet so suddenly that he recoiled back and
looked at her for a moment with an amaze
that was very soon changed to severity presently
however guessing the object she had
come to solicit his countenance saddened with
pity and he gently and graciously took herby
the hands and raised her from the ground
my good lord athos said his majesty
to your care we commit our fair cousin
and when the business the day is done we
shall then ourself confer with her and he
would have softly passed her to the earl but
she clung to his arm
after dropping on his hand a few tears
she cried
o no not yet your majesty hear first
what i would say whi your business is
finishedalas i it may then be too later
 i cannot but divine the suit you so earnestly
desire to advocates replied the kiss
but sweet lady it were to suppose scmie
c
the spaewife 
ill fault in a great solemnity to say that it
should be suspended for any particular solicitation
or affection i speik to you as one
whose eminent qualities i do not lightly
esteem and i know that you are in this
matter borne forward by no common motive
but till the trial is over my kingly obligations
forbid me to listen to any plea 
mercy
 i did not come for mercy exclaimed
sibilla but to petition your majesty in behalf
 justice which in this matter stands
in the inuninent danger being hereafter condemned
as cruelty i doubt not the grievous
guilt the unfortunate princes but i
would supplicate your majesty to consider
what boon shall by their death result to your
loving people for unless good shall therefrom
arise there can be no justice but only vengeance
in commanding tate bkxkl to flow than
has already stained the scaffold
the king stood in wonder to hear her speak
 the spaewite
after this maimer for though he was well acquainted
with her lofty spirit he yet thought
from her betrothment to the outlawed lord
james that she was come to entreat him with
feminine importunity for mitigation and pardon

seeing him touched by what she had said
sibilla continued
 when the earl lennox stands before
you i humbly supplicate your majesty to
call to mind that he is more than fourscore
years old i do not however ask that pity
should be allowed to plead for his grey hairs
no my gracious sovereign but only that you
will note how plainly heaven has by its own officered
age served the warrant by which
he will soon indeed be taken to answer for
all his manifold sins and treasons that he
has offended his country and your majesty
may not be doubted but what better judge
can arbitrate the sad question his guilt
than the ancient days who with a shinthe
spaewife 
ing hand opens the everlasting clasps the
 life 
the king moved by the tenderness this
piteous advocacy seemed for a moment to
relent from his stem sublimity but at that
juncture a solemn peal from the trumpets
without recalled him to the awful sense 
his regal task and he laid his hand on his
heart and bowing his head to the suppliant
moved mournfully and slowly to the hall 
judgment
 the spaewife
chap xxiv
the trial lasted all day during which the
lady sibilla afflicted with ef and fear
and many a fiery sting despair sequestered
herself in an upper chamber the castle inaccessible
to all but her maidens whom
ever and anon she sent to inquire how the
court was proceeding
sometimes she received for answer that
the witnesses prevaricated and that it was
thought the prisoners would be assoilzied
at others the poor damsels returned weeping
and sat down beside her in silence and then
her heart beat audibly and she spoke not to
them till after a season had passed when she
bade them go and inquire again
in this mournful condition the day passed
and the shades evening began to fall and
the spaewife 
still she had received no assurance to her
hopes nor were her fears darkened deeper
than in the morning in the gloom however
 the twilight a rustling was heard
among the multitude that covered in clusters
all the castlehill and the sound 
trumpets soon after announced that the session
was ended and that the king was returning
from the hall
on hearing this noise and clangour sibilla
rose from her seat and rushed towards the
door but in the same moment as if she had
been arrested by some invisible hand she
suddenly stopped and looked round and
gasped with horror her maidens ran to her
assistance but she fluttered her hands at
them and cried go go they knew
that she desired but to learn the issue the
trial and they hastened out the room
wishing that they might obtain some encouraging
tidings but they did not return
the twilight was now fading away and
s the spaewife
save a deep and solemn murmuring from the
waves and movements the multitude without
silence clothed with the shadows night
stole from the lonely mountains into the hamlets
 the social valleys
in the meantime sibilla had retired into
the obscurest corner the chamber and sat
down but though thirsting to know the
doom the prisoners her will was fettered
as with the incubus the nightmare and
her spirit appalled with fantasies more dismal
than the unblest imaginings a guilty conscience
and she remained as still as an alabaster
effigy on a tomb
in this woeful state she heard a universal
rustle from the multitude as if a sudden
gale had passed over the leafy boughs 
a wide forest the aught a torch from the
court below then flashed against the ceiling 
the room a low and smothered noise and
whispering arose and a sound many feet
moving slowly onward she listenedthe
spaewife s
that moment the tolling a bell made her
start from her seat she rushed to the window
e could discern nothing distinctly but
there were torches and soldiers and spears
glimmering and here and there a face fearfully
brightened by the glare the torches yet
she could see that all was moving forward
like the waters the river's tide in the darkness
and solemnity the night and anon
she beheld in the gloom a sullen and terrible
form walking alone as if eschewed by all
and his arms were bare to the shoulder and
he carried a gleaming axe then came a
youth a noble air and haughty carriage
whom she soon discovered to be the lord
alexander he too was alone and the
soldiers that lined the way followed him with
admiring eyes as he passed the next that
came was duke murdoch leaning on the
arm bishop wardle and they passed
and then there was a void for some time
but soon a mournful breathing compassion
m 
 the paewife
was heard and the guards fell backward and
turned aside ther heads to shun the t
that was coming sibilla darted towards it a
fearful momentary glance and she saw an
old and palsied hand bearing a crucifix
coming totteringly forward it was the aged
earl lennox accompanied by a priest
whose arm he grasped for support as with
feeble and faltering steps he passed slowly
along
sibiua was so melted by the sad sight
that she wrung her hands and ran into the
farthest comer the chamber and wept and
when the violence this grief abated she
returned to the window and opened the casement
and listened with an eager ear all was
silent then a low murmuring rose from the
multitude beyond the walls again there was a
sudden silence and then she heard the fall 
a heavy stroke an awful moan followed and
the echoes that dwell in the abbeycrags and
in the valley and the cliffs daniel sulk
spaewife 
lely responded to the sound then a dreadful
voice made proclamation some terrible
event but the tenour thereof she could not
hear nor was there any response
the bell tolled again and again there was
silence and a second stroke fell more heavily
than the first and the dreadful voice again
made proclamation
again the bell tolled and then there was a
rushing sound as parting waters in the
midst which sibilla heard the deathaxe
fall a third time but when the voice the
executioner began again to make proclamation
a shriek so wild so howling and so full
uf sorrow arose from the multitude that she
felt as if the very earth shuddered at the
sound and swinging powerless from her hold
sank to the floor in a swoon

the body the lord walter after his execution
had been carried to the abbey 
to abide the hinges pleasure
and when the sentence the law had been
fulfilled on the other illfated princes the
earl athos came to his majesty to confer
with him concerning them
 their lives replied the king have
satisfied justice see therefore i pray you
that their remains are interred as befits their
rank it is not however meet that persons
who die attainted in their blood and dignities
should be allowed the pageantries heraldry
let them have honourable but private burials 
in that replied the earl your majesty
wisely anticipates the opinion your
council and with permission being myself
the spaewife 
the nearest their kin i will attend as chief
mourner
the king abruptly raised his left band
from the table at which he was sitting as if he
had been startled by the proposal but suddenly
subduing the surprise the moment
be replied
 no my good uncle that were too much
as you are now presumptive heir to the crown 
for the life the lord james not only as a
partner in his father and his brothers treasons
but for his own rebellion in lennox
stands doubly forfeited for them you cannot
grieve for they have suffered justly
albeit pity sued earnestly for them especially
for poor old lennox it becomes not therefore
the state in any its members to seem
to mourn for them princes in their dignity
should have no respect to kin but sofar
you may shew sufficient sympathy for
our illfated cousins by bearing yourself
my command to the abbot cambusken

 the spaewife
net to the that with his brethren he
perform the obsequies tonight as if he knew
only the rank and nothing the offence
 the deceased
the earl had been so overtaken by the
quickness the king's amaze at his suggestion
that he stood somewhat rebuked while
his majesty was speaking in so much that
the king thinking his command to the abbot
 cambuskenneth was deemed not enough to
ensure a becoming pageant added 
 the world my lord can expect no
more from me i would have them interred
as christian men noble birth not remembering
they are executed traitors but i
cannot consent that their funeral should bear
the ostentation which belongs to un attainted
princes
i beseech your majesty said the earl
 to permit some other messenger to bear
your orders to the abbot for as in your
wisdom your majesty has discerned that i
the spaewife 
should not appear in the ceremony i hope
it may stand with your pleasure to spare me
also from that duty's
the king mused for the space a minute
and then replied
 i lay my command upon you in order to
shew the abbot how much i shall expect 
his house but even now you would have
undertaken to be chief mourners
the earl bowed and saying it shall be
as your majesty desires retired and wait
forthwith to the abbey whither the bodies
had in the meantime been carried and according
as the king had desired and expected
the abbot ordered a wide grave to be prepared
in front the altar the abbeychurch
in which at midnight with many
chants and holy requiems the interment wds
performed
at the conclusion the solemnity the
earl athos who had remained a spectator
left the church to return to the abbeygate
s the spaewife
where his horse and servants were in attendance
in passing over the tombs and graves
which lay in his way he stopped unconsciously
and looked up to the can and cloudless
moon that in her loftiness seemed as it
were the visible and embodied beauty tranquillity
and silence but almost in the same
instant a cold and skinny hand took firmly
hold his and on hastily looking round
he beheld the charnelhouse visage the
spaewife at his shoulder
what think you now my lord athos 
said anniple did na i tell you that after
five burials ye would be a crowned king and
this night there has been four them when
king james is dead yell wear the crown but
i wish you meikle gude o for ye have na
jsayh me yet for that grand spaeing
the earl on seeing who it was that had
seized his hand so familiarly said 
why anniple you do not reckon well 
the five funerals have all been performed
spabwife 
the regent robert's long ago and the four
we have this night seen
ha exclaimed the spaewife do ye
keep count 
the earl shuddered from head to foot at
the searching glance with which she thus penetrated
the secret abysses his spirit in a
moment however he recovered his selfpossession
and the fantastical creature began to
chatter her teeth and to chuckle with expectation
holding out her hand saying buta
get a grace and a grant my lordone
two and three
there take that and begone replied the
earl giving her a piece money
 this is an alios but no pay
 but said athos and he looked apprehensively
around you must tell me seriously
who is to succeed king james 
anniple started back at the question and
raised her hand flutteringly for a moment as
if to admonish him suddenly however re
 the spaewife
collecting herself she again held out her
hand saying have na i told you long
ago and syne that yere to be a crowned
king and yet ye grudge to pay me for the
tidings though ye have had this night four
beheaded men in their bloody windingsheets
testifying that as sure as death is its a thing
that shall be
 thou art an importunate bgar re
pled the earl struggling to overcome the
impression which her language had produced
 and i am surprised that you get admit
sion at such a time night to this places
its a the house i have lord athos
since the wicked bishop o dunblane part his
foul servitors rive down the bonny bower that
i bigger muse between his kirkyard and the
wimplingbum o it was a bathe and a winsome
place the waters afore the door ran
linking and dancing and swirling and
whirling like blithe barnes at their chaffing
my douce baudrons lay on my lap singing
the spaewife 
cuttycrumb frae dawn to dark poor thing 
it had but that ae sang to pleasure me and
true tyke was like a brother the deeps

monk's carcass that ruggit the roofs and

my kind lessen for biting his leg at the
berrying for nobody thrives that does ill
to anniple dunblane so pay your debt
my lord and be an honest man or
 what will you do 
i'll maybe space a your fortune
the earl flung his purse into her bosom
and hurried from the churchyard

while those terrible tragedies were acting at
stirling the duchess albany was removed
as a prisoner from her pleasant inlaid palace
at falkland to the strong rewarded fortalice
 pantaloon for it was thought by all men
that her high mindedness would not patiently
suffer such an entire dilapidation her house
but would prompt her to stir up the friends
 her lord and her father to attempt some enterprise
 rescue or intimidation the apprehension
however the machinations and
treasons in which they had been engaged lay
heavy on her heart and instead feeling
the stem instigation revenge her majestic
spirit was weighed down with the persuasion
 their guilt and amidst its fears and mourning
did homage to justice still she was not
the spajbwife 
bert all hope but trusting to the ties 
kindred she soothed herself with the notion
that whatever might be the issue the trials
the king out respect for his own blood
would surely never suffer execution to follow
sustained by this fond flattery she preserved
her equanimity and even when the morning
 the lord walters trial came she rose with
a serene countenance and only remained a
little longer than she was wont at her orisons
towards the evening however she became
restless and moved to and fro in her chamber
sometimes halting suddenly at others
pacing the floor with wild gestures and perturbed
steps and teddy glenjuckie the
only one her gentlewomen who had been
permitted to accompany her albeit a loquacious
humour was so touched with dread
when she beheld these outward symptoms 
the inward anguish that she sat apart ruminating
in silence
at her accustomed hour the duchess re
 the spaewife
tired to her couch but not to rest she wondered
that no news came from stirling and
sometimes her wishes made her interpret this
lack tidings into an auspicious omen in
this state the solemn hours the night passed
away but sleep cam not to her tearful eyelids
at the grey dawn she was seen slowly
pacing the battlements casting many a wistful
look towards the west and ever and anon
breathing the low sigh sadness as she saw
afar off the brightening summit the noun
tain at the foot which stood the towers 
falkland that home which had been whitened
by the innocency her children and which
with them she was destined never to behold
again
all day she was by fits touched as it were
with frenzy still in the midst those fearful
pangs the fortitude her spirit never
departed and when the tear was shed and
the shock over she appeared as august and
serene as if neither the alarms a daughter
the spaewife 
a wife nor a mother had any dominion within
her bosom and she sat at the window 
her chamber in the western tower and beheld
the sun set and the evening close and
the stars lighted up and the moon arise calmly
awaiting the consummation her fate but
still no messenger came and still the hope
that wrestled with her and would fly away
she continued to detain with a fond and endearing
struggle at last soon after midnight
the sound a buglehorn was heard at
the gate it made her start from her seat
with the intent rushing to the warder's
tower to hear who at that time sought admission
but ere she had half way passed
across the floor she checked her precipitation
and returning sedately to her seat desired
her gentlewoman to order candles to
be brought in for till that occurrence she
had all the evening remained without any
other light than the moonbeams through the
casement
 the spaewife
scarcely had the menial in attendance
placed the lights on the table when the captain
 the castle entered and said that a
herald had arrived from stirling and demanded
admission the captain though an
austere old shorter faultered as he delivered
the message and avoided her eyes 
give him admittance i have longed
for his comings exclaimed the duchess rising
hastily let him come in let him
come in whatever his tidings or his office
may be
the captain turned quickly round and
hastened out the room her gentlewoman
who had observed his emotion retired
to a comer and sat down but the duchess
continued standing
after a brief interval the captain returned
with the herald who trembled exceedingly
as he approached towards her with a letter in
his hand she saw the paper and snatched
it eagerly from him but instanter the fortithe
spaewife w
tide her spirit recovered its firmness and
without breaking the seal she walked deliberately
to the candle
the herald who had knelt down to present
the letter at the moment when she took
it from him continued on the floor and
seemed wrapt with amazement when he beheld
her open it and peruse it without trepidation

 it is all over now said the duchess
when she had read the fatal intelligence
they have all suffered the sentence the
law a slight flutter moved her kerchief as
she said these words but she laid the letter
on the table and turning to the herald who
had risen from his kneeling she added with
a struggling voice if they deserved to die
their doom was just sir have you any
other business here 
the herald was unable to make any reply
but bowed as one that is before the hallowed
shrine some glorious martyr and retired
vol i n
 the spaewife
followed by the captain who seemed in haste
to quit the room but before leaving it he
turned round and for a moment looked at 
 
her grace with scarcelyless than religious 
reverence and then hurried away
the duchess still they were gone moved
not from the spot where she was standing
near the table but when the door was shut
and none present but her gentlewoman she
raised her hands distractedly and with the
wildest note desolate misery cried god
help me and rushed into an inner room

chap xxvii
it came to pass some time after the dolorous
events whereof recital has been made
that the king summoned the states the
reahn to parliament at perth and thither
repaired sir robert gramme the fiercest adherent
 the faction the house albany
he grudged the frustration his design for
the deliverance the lord walter from
the bass isle as if it had been to himself an
insolent taunt or a galling injury and his
dread the kings justice was as a spur
to his revenge in so much that he pondered
by night and by day in what manner to
ratify a resentment that blood only could
quench yet though thus borne onward to
crime by the incitements destiny he was
nevertheless deterred from immediate venge
s the spaswifk
once by considerations interest for even
in his wildest and worst passions this remorseless
conspirator ever had respect to his estate
it is true that the trials and execution 
the princes smote him with amazement but it
soon passed away and like the violent flame
that bursts forth after the brief damping 
oil cast upon the fire the fiend which possessed
him raged fiercer than ever
at perth he met with many the baronage
malcontent with the strict enforcement
 the royal authority which hampered them
in their feuds and forays and their other
hasty administrations redress in their own
specialities and finding them in this mood
he began afar off to work upon their distempered
minds
this method rule he was wont to
say which king james has learnt from our
old enemies the english may not in itself
i am free to acknowledge be wrong nay i
doubt not it accords passing well with the
the spaewife 
humour those for whom it was contrived
ibr with them charters and statutes have the
authority rights and justice but it suits
neither our usages nor the temperament 
scottish blood the english at any time
will rather seek another's help than serve
themselves and hence it is that they so
tamely leave their wrongs to the adjudications
 judges and juries but it is the nature
 every free and trueborn scot to do
his own business and accordingly from the
oddest times the monarchy our kings have
never had leave to meddle with the jurisdictions
 the chiefs and barons in verity i
should be glad to know how a travelling man
 law going from town to town with a 
under his arm like a pedlar can see into the
deservings illdoers so well as the lord
that lives among them and knows their habit
and is familiar with their repute by
such jurisprudence i grant that the act 
wrong may be well enough sifted but is it
 the
justice that the doer diereaf should only be
punished for that particular act however had
us foigooe conduct may hare been fair
my part i think the kings prerogative
should be upheld in au things but i do
not discern why it is that he has been so loadvised
as to treat his nobles as if they were
all alike and take from us the sword even
in our own defences when he may go to war
with the english or any other crown shall
we say to him he dmuld not and are notour
chiefs and barons with respect to one
another as free to act as kings who are but
barons with a greater vassalage however
not to speak that which may be wrongfully
repeated to our prejudice iriio can tel
what will ensue by this new way taking
subsidies i do not say that king james
hath any ill intent in enriching his treasury
by taxes but if a king have money enough
to keep orders independent the service
 his vassals what man any degree can
the spaewif 
then brag freedom or call aught his own
whether the thing be life limb or land 
by title discourses this bearing he so
beguiled them to his will that in the 
they appointed him to remonstrate with the
king against the inroads that were daily made
on their ancient privileges
 i shall not shrink in the task said he
 but then you must be prepared to back my
endeavour for i doubt not the king will
ill brook the representation and we all know
if he call it treason it is but another word
for death now i am not a man that will
be worried like a rabbit i will stand to
danger whatever it may be and i care not
what life may perish in defending my own
it is therefore needful to be prepared for
the worst and i should remind you that the
earl athos who has been always heart
and hand with the king in this newfangled
governance can never be a fit person to
 the spaewife
name for the regency should our adventure
come to that extremity
thus all things were duly concerted for
executing at the opening parliament
what had been in this manner determined 
but when the king appeared on the throne
gramme transported with a sudden sting 
ire and malevolence forgot the policy he was
pledged to follow and rushing upon his majesty
cried aloud 
 i arrest you sir in the name the three
estates the realm here assembled for as
your people have sworn to obey you so are
you constrained by an equal oath to govern
them cording to their laws and customs
and in saying this still grasping the king's
arm he turned round and said to the barons
and prelates there present is it not theft
as i say but evi those his own fac
lion were so struck with consternation at his
rashness and so awed by the serenity which
the king preserved that they had not heart
the spaewife 
to give him any demonstration encouragement

 take him to prison said his majesty
calmly and he was thereupon seized by the
arms and carried away bitterly upbraiding
the dastards for whom he had adventured so
daringly the business the session then
proceeded as if no such bold treason had
been attempted and when it was ended his
majesty having retired to his closet sent for
the earl athos to confer with him concerning
the outrage
 i can discover said his majesty when
the earl was come before him that the austerity
 our impartial administration has
galled many among you else this audacious
sir robert gramme would not have ventured
to lay hands on the king in parliament
now as the all government should be
to cherish goodwill among the subjects
there must be some lack policy if not 
justice in the rigour our proceedings there
n
s the spaewife
fare let ns speedily j redress the grievance i
will pardon grseme for by the bravery 
his attempt he matched himself ast were
only with me and since he was none seconded
i shall not let it be searched whether or
no he had any abettors
 it may perhaps be as your majesty says 
but an outrage so flagrant is beyond pardon
if however the mercifulness your own
gracious nature plead for him surely it will
be enough to let him have his life the very
least that can be meted to him is banishment
and the forfeiture his estates
 to so bold and bad a man as i have
heard even you my lord describe sir robert
grseme such a punishment would only be asa
license and warrant to work nusdnef 
it may be replied the earl that i have
spoken him in heat for he has ever been the
most turbulent the albany faction but
however that may have been it is not to bethought
even though your majesty be coni've
spaewife s
tent to pardon the insulting treasm done to
yourself that the states will overlook the
breach their own privileges
the king remained for several minutes
ruminating and silent and then saide
this affair troubles me i cannot altogether
pardon gramme without giving offence
to many the nobility and yet he is a man
 such a nature or i mistake the indications
 character that any measure punishment
however small will become with him a motive
for vengeance i would either deal with him
gently or not spare him at alle
ifs replied the earl such be your
majestys sentiment and you are not moved
in the business by any consideration your
own but only as the matter may effect the
public weal let the lesser punishment be tried
for whatever impression it may make on
gramme himself your royal clemency cannot
ftdl to prove most salutary upon others as
i doubt not there are abettors his treason
 the spaewife
who at this moment tremble for themselves
they will be glad to find their heads safe by
the leniency shown to him were he entirely
pardoned they would suspect it was done
but to gain time till their whole plot was
found out
 there is something like reason in what
yoa say my lord and i will remit the matter
into your hands and yet i know not
how it is but i am not satisfied in compromising
any point policy with such a daring
offender as sir robert gramme and so saying
his majesty retired to his chamber and
the earl coming away through the cloister
met bishop wardle to whom he rehearsed
what had passed between him and the king
knowing that his majesty would probably 
his own accord tell him
 i do almost lament said the bishop
 that your counsel in this case has prevailed
 and yet i would not have the traitor pardoned
for i know him well i know him by
the spabwifb 
a confession which he once made to me while
he was yet a mere youth scarcely bearded
confession did i call it a bravery rather
 crimes the subtile adder has not more
skill in finding venom to supply the malice 
her bite than that dreadful man in discovering
fit means and instruments for his atrocious
purposes
the earl made no answer to this but
seemed so thoughtful that the religious pe
kte recollecting his consanguinity to gramme
endeavoured to soften the harsh opinion which
he had thus indignantly delivered
you are mistaken my lord bishop
said the earl i am not troubled by what
you have told me but i dread to think that
a spirit so implacable should be set at large
goaded with the sense punishment
 it is not too late ta have him brought to
trial and condemned said the bishop
the earl gave a short shudder revolt as
 the spaewtfe
it were at this but in a moment he replied
sedately
though i know gramme to be the
most daring and dangerous man at this time
within the realm scotland yet it cannot
stand with the king's honour to change
in his purpose towards him banishment and
the forfeiture his goods is the sentence that
will be executed
in advising that said bishop wardle
 you have incurred a fearful responsibility
to this the earl made no answer and
the bishop discerning that what he had said
caused displeasure parted from him next
day when the states again assembled in parliament
sentence was recorded against gramme
as the earl athos had suggested but instead
 going into banishment he was no
sooner set free custody than he retired into
the wildest highlands and gave himself upto
wrath and revenge

xse evening soon after the daring adventure
 the traitor gramme as the king was sitting
alone in his closet pondering his royal trusts
and the ordure that his name might have with
posterity he called sir william chrichton the
chancellor before him a man richly endowed
with wisdom grave temperate and yet withal
 an urbane disposition and said to him
 there is a mission charity sir william
chrichton in which i would fain have
the help your good offices the forlorn
estate that noble lady the duchess 
albany is a thing that lies very sore upon
me whatever were the faults and offeiicefi
 her father her husband and her sons
verily she has had cause for great sorrow 
and though justice might not mitigate the
 the spaewife
misfortunes that she hath borne yet pity
will constrain us to lighten to the utmost the
grief wherein she sits so disconsolate i pray
you therefore sir william go to her and
not only set her free from pantaloon but undertake
from me to restore to her whatever
she may desire the lands and heritage 
her family i give all to your wisdom and
discretion to act and to do for me as you
would wish to see done by one who would
earn without the abatement any present
duty the guerdon an honourable renown
hereafter
sir william chrichton did not make any
immediate response to this command but remained
thoughtful for some time in so much
that the king added
am grieved sir william that you take
time to consider this compassionate matter
you do not think in wishing to soften the rigorous
adversity that afflicts the duchess i
thereby manifest aught which the invidious
the spaewife 
world might in its malice or envy impute tome
as an acknowledgment having done
wrong 
 nos replied the chancellor far be
from me the thought that your majesty can
be swayed in any good or just or kind intent
by the awe those who look invidiously even
on the virtues princes but after the terrible
task justice which your majesty has achieved
it is meet to be considered whether the
time for remission and indulgence be yet
come the duchess albany is a lady
famed for an august spirit and a masculine
understanding fit it is said for the rule and
sovereignty a kingdom what has befallen
her family cannot but have struck sharply and
sorely into her heart and a necessity it
would seem she must bear against your majesty
an ireful and implacable mind for it is
the very nature ill fortune to stir up those
evil qualities in ourselves which but for adversity
might have slept unknown like the
s the paewifk
foul toad that lurks under the flower and is not
angered till themowers scythe hath wounded
his back moreover your majesty would do
well to call to mind that her outlawed son the
lord james still lives and threatens what
he might do were his mother reinstated even
in no more than the earldom her father is a
thing that requires the wisdom all the
council to consider for what nf ay be given
to her will be given to him and in him the
enemy has been but disarmed his anime
duties bum as fiercely as ever and it were
well to weigh the consequence restoring to
him any portion his arms even though it
were no more than his dirk
 i have thrust all that sir william 
but we shall have done little for the peace 
the realm if we cannot venture to pity and
relieve the sufferings a poor widow truly
sir wmiam it stands not with my honour if
after such sacrifices we may not do as we list in
lose humanities which all men must approve
the spaewife 
no the safety the state shall be maintained
without respect to what maybe done to lighten
the condition the duchess albany
i do therefore again say that you will do mea
kind service by undertaking this missions
sir william seeing the king so bent and
having noted withal the greatness his motives
in whatsoever he was minded to do
made no farther controversy but retired
and went forthwith to pantaloon and when
he was come thither he was conducted to
the chamber the duchess who was much
moved when she beheld him but without
expressing any sentiment the surprise wherewith
she was agitated she waved her hand
and pointing to a chair invited him to be
seated
after the lapse a short time in which
sir william remained as if he had expected
that she would inquire the object his visit
he began to speak the joyfulness with which
he had received the kings commands to asses
the spaewife
sure her grace the good will that his majesty
bore towards her and that he had already
delivered his orders to the constable to allow
her to quit the castle
and whither shall i go who will venture
to shelter one who is the daughter the
widow and the mother traitors alas
sir william chrichton you have brought meno
boon
 but i am empowered to restore to you
all the lands lennox that pertained to the
earl your father
 my father oh what have you done to
that poor infirm old man 
 i am farther authorised to say that all the
dignities and titles honour which you have
derived from the duke your husband shall
be continued to you as heretofore
 what the titles the style as duchess
 albany as duke murdoch's wife y
 every thing to the utmost pretext 
heraldry
the spaewife 
the duchess as he said this smiled but
with so much sadness in her look that the
chancellor was rebuked
 dignities and titles sir william exclaimed
the duchess to the utmost pretext
 heraldry verily the king is royally munificent
he will give me the titles i had
with the duke wife was one them swill
he restore that mother i was that too sir
william chrichton where is my princely
walter and my warm freehearted alexander 
alas r cried the chancellor that i
should have so marred the king's kindnesses
 the kings kindness cried the duchess
with a withering look oh who could
utter such a word to me my old greyheaded
father my husband my sons where are
they all j the king's kindness oh sir
william chrichton when first i but tried to
call that kindness by the name justice the
mingled feelings the daughter wife and
mother revolted at the endeavour
 the spaewipb
for some time the chancellor stood appalled
and pierced to the heart but when the
vehemence her grief had somewhat abated
he again protested his sorrow for having so
unwittingly touched her wounds and then
he began to speak the business on which
he had come soliciting to know what answer
he should bear to the king
 tell him that when you offered me the
lids lennox i wept for my father when
you promised me the restoration the dignities
that belonged to me as a wife i asked
for my husband and when you told me 
his kindness kindness oh where are all
my children kindness herod in his jealousy
slew but peevish infants mine were
princely men when the angry heavens
punished guilty egyptonly the firstbon
were slain and daughters and mothers there
had fathers and husbands left to share their
sorrow but all are taken from me i think
sir william chrichton that i could have willthe
spaewife 
ingle parted with one to have redeemed the
others but oh to take them all with one
stroke to fell all my flourishing grove the
merciless thunderbolt is satisfied with a single
tree but surely i am made some insensate
element that i survive such desolation
and hear kindness niobe that lost but her
children wept herself to stone o murdoch
murdoch had i been that true wife which i
was once accounted i should have gone with
thee to prison no chiding for those fond
errors which have proved the ruin our gallant
boys would then have escaped my lips
but i would have taken thy head upon my
lap and soothed thee to sleep and shed no
tear neither for son nor father till that was
done methinks it would have been a far
easier endurance than what i now suffer to
have listened to the knelling their fatal
bell and to have gone with them to the scaffold
and seen the dreadful preparations for
then as the first axe lightened in the air
dhave closed my
have heard it fall
sbshe anguish 
for her measureless
withstand there woe
quitting the room
plating the task

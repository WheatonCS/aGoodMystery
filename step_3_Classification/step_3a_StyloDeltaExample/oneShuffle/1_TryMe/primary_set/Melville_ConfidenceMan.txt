the confidence-man his masquerade

a mute goes aboard a boat on the mississippi


at sunrise on a first of april there appeared suddenly
as manco capac at the lake titicaca a man in
cream-colors at the water-side in the city of st louis

his cheek was fair his chin downy his hair flaxen
his hat a white fur one with a long fleecy nap he
had neither trunk valise carpet-bag nor parcel no
porter followed him he was unaccompanied by
friends from the shrugged shoulders titters whispers
wonderings of the crowd it was plain that he
was in the extremest sense of the word a stranger

in the same moment with his advent he stepped
aboard the favorite steamer fidle on the point of
starting for new orleans stared at but unsaluted
with the air of one neither courting nor shunning
regard but evenly pursuing the path of duty lead it
through solitudes or cities he held on his way along




the lower deck until he chanced to come to a placard
nigh the captain's office offering a reward for the
capture of a mysterious impostor supposed to have
recently arrived from the east quite an original
genius in his vocation as would appear though wherein
his originality consisted was not clearly given but
what purported to be a careful description of his person
followed

as if it had been a theatre-bill crowds were gathered
about the announcement and among them certain
chevaliers whose eyes it was plain were on the capitals
or at least earnestly seeking sight of them from
behind intervening coats but as for their fingers they
were enveloped in some myth though during a chance
interval one of these chevaliers somewhat showed his
hand in purchasing from another chevalier ex-officio a
peddler of money-belts one of his popular safe-guards
while another peddler who was still another versatile
chevalier hawked in the thick of the throng the lives
of measan the bandit of ohio murrel the pirate of
the mississippi and the brothers harpe the thugs
of the green river country in kentucky   creatures
with others of the sort one and all exterminated at the
time and for the most part like the hunted generations
of wolves in the same regions leaving comparatively
few successors which would seem cause for unalloyed
gratulation and is such to all except those who think
that in new countries where the wolves are killed off
the foxes increase

pausing at this spot the stranger so far succeeded




in threading his way as at last to plant himself just
beside the placard when producing a small slate and
tracing some words upon it he held it up before him
on a level with the placard so that they who read the
one might read the other the words were these   

charity thinketh no evil

as in gaining his place some little perseverance not
to say persistence of a mildly inoffensive sort had been
unavoidable it was not with the best relish that the
crowd regarded his apparent intrusion and upon a
more attentive survey perceiving no badge of authority
about him but rather something quite the contrary   
he being of an aspect so singularly innocent
an aspect too which they took to be somehow inappropriate
to the time and place and inclining to the
notion that his writing was of much the same sort in
short taking him for some strange kind of simpleton
harmless enough would he keep to himself but not
wholly unobnoxious as an intruder   they made no
scruple to jostle him aside while one less kind than
the rest or more of a wag by an unobserved stroke
dexterously flattened down his fleecy hat upon his
head without readjusting it the stranger quietly
turned and writing anew upon the slate again held
it up   

charity suffereth long and is kind

illy pleased with his pertinacity as they thought it
the crowd a second time thrust him aside and not
without epithets and some buffets all of which were




unresented but as if at last despairing of so difficult
an adventure wherein one apparently a non-resistant
sought to impose his presence upon fighting characters
the stranger now moved slowly away yet not before
altering his writing to this   

charity endureth all things

shield-like bearing his slate before him amid stares
and jeers he moved slowly up and down at his turning
points again changing his inscription to   

charity believeth all things
and then   

charity never faileth

the word charity as originally traced remained
throughout uneffaced not unlike the left-hand numeral
of a printed date otherwise left for convenience in
blank

to some observers the singularity if not lunacy of
the stranger was heightened by his muteness and perhaps
also by the contrast to his proceedings afforded in
the actions   quite in the wonted and sensible order of
things   of the barber of the boat whose quarters
under a smoking-saloon and over against a bar-room
was next door but two to the captain's office as if
the long wide covered deck hereabouts built up on
both sides with shop-like windowed spaces were some
constantinople arcade or bazaar where more than one
trade is plied this river barber aproned and slippered
but rather crusty-looking for the moment it may be
from being newly out of bed was throwing open his




premises for the day and suitably arranging the exterior
with business-like dispatch having rattled down
his shutters and at a palm-tree angle set out in the
iron fixture his little ornamental pole and this without
overmuch tenderness for the elbows and toes of the
crowd he concluded his operations by bidding people
stand still more aside when jumping on a stool he
hung over his door on the customary nail a gaudy sort
of illuminated pasteboard sign skillfully executed by
himself gilt with the likeness of a razor elbowed in
readiness to shave and also for the public benefit with
two words not unfrequently seen ashore gracing other
shops besides barbers   

 no trust 

an inscription which though in a sense not less intrusive
than the contrasted ones of the stranger did
not as it seemed provoke any corresponding derision
or surprise much less indignation and still less to all
appearances did it gain for the inscriber the repute of
being a simpleton

meanwhile he with the slate continued moving
slowly up and down not without causing some stares
to change into jeers and some jeers into pushes and
some pushes into punches when suddenly in one of
his turns he was hailed from behind by two porters
carrying a large trunk but as the summons though
loud was without effect they accidentally or otherwise
swung their burden against him nearly overthrowing
him when by a quick start a peculiar inarticulate
moan and a pathetic telegraphing of his fingers he




involuntarily betrayed that he was not alone dumb
but also deaf

presently as if not wholly unaffected by his reception
thus far he went forward seating himself in a
retired spot on the forecastle nigh the foot of a ladder
there leading to a deck above up and down which ladder
some of the boatmen in discharge of their duties
were occasionally going

from his betaking himself to this humble quarter
it was evident that as a deck-passenger the stranger
simple though he seemed was not entirely ignorant of
his place though his taking a deck-passage might have
been partly for convenience as from his having no
luggage it was probable that his destination was one
of the small wayside landings within a few hours sail
but though he might not have a long way to go yet he
seemed already to have come from a very long distance

though neither soiled nor slovenly his cream-colored
suit had a tossed look almost linty as if traveling
night and day from some far country beyond the prairies
he had long been without the solace of a bed
his aspect was at once gentle and jaded and from the
moment of seating himself increasing in tired abstraction
and dreaminess gradually overtaken by slumber
his flaxen head drooped his whole lamb-like figure
relaxed and half reclining against the ladder's foot lay
motionless as some sugar-snow in march which softly
stealing down over night with its white placidity startles
the brown farmer peering out from his threshold at
daybreak

such the epitaphic comments conflictingly spoken or
thought of a miscellaneous company who assembled




on the overlooking cross-wise balcony at the forward
end of the upper deck near by had not witnessed preceding
occurrences

meantime like some enchanted man in his grave
happily oblivious of all gossip whether chiseled or
chatted the deaf and dumb stranger still tranquilly
slept while now the boat started on her voyage

the great ship-canal of ving-king-ching in the
flowery kingdom seems the mississippi in parts
where amply flowing between low vine-tangled
banks flat as tow-paths it bears the huge toppling
steamers bedizened and lacquered within like imperial
junks

pierced along its great white bulk with two tiers of
small embrasure-like windows well above the waterline
the fidle though might at distance have been
taken by strangers for some whitewashed fort on a
floating isle

merchants on change seem the passengers that buzz
on her decks while from quarters unseen comes a murmur
as of bees in the comb fine promenades domed
saloons long galleries sunny balconies confidential
passages bridal chambers state-rooms plenty as pigeonholes
and out-of-the-way retreats like secret drawers
in an escritoire present like facilities for publicity or
privacy auctioneer or coiner with equal ease might
somewhere here drive his trade

though her voyage of twelve hundred miles extends
from apple to orange from clime to clime yet like
any small ferry-boat to right and left at every landing




the huge fidle still receives additional passengers in
exchange for those that disembark so that though
always full of strangers she continually in some degree
adds to or replaces them with strangers still
more strange like rio janeiro fountain fed from the
cocovarde mountains which is ever overflowing with
strange waters but never with the same strange particles
in every part

though hitherto as has been seen the man in
cream-colors had by no means passed unobserved yet
by stealing into retirement and there going asleep
and continuing so he seemed to have courted oblivion
a boon not often withheld from so humble an applicant
as he those staring crowds on the shore were now
left far behind seen dimly clustering like swallows on
eaves while the passengers attention was soon drawn
away to the rapidly shooting high bluffs and shot-towers
on the missouri shore or the bluff-looking missourians
and towering kentuckians among the throngs on the
decks

by-and-by   two or three random stoppages having
been made and the last transient memory of the slumberer
vanished and he himself not unlikely waked up
and landed ere now   the crowd as is usual began in
all parts to break up from a concourse into various
clusters or squads which in some cases disintegrated
again into quartettes trios and couples or even solitaires
involuntarily submitting to that natural law
which ordains dissolution equally to the mass as in
time to the member




as among chaucer's canterbury pilgrims or those
oriental ones crossing the red sea towards mecca in
the festival month there was no lack of variety natives
of all sorts and foreigners men of business and
men of pleasure parlor men and backwoodsmen
farm-hunters and fame-hunters heiress-hunters goldhunters
buffalo-hunters bee-hunters happiness-hunters
truth-hunters and still keener hunters after all
these hunters fine ladies in slippers and moccasined

in short a piebald parliament an anacharsis cloots
congress of all kinds of that multiform pilgrim species
man

as pine beech birch ash hackmatack hemlock
spruce bass-wood maple interweave their foliage in
the natural wood so these varieties of mortals blended
their varieties of visage and garb a tartar-like picturesqueness
a sort of pagan abandonment and assurance
here reigned the dashing and all-fusing spirit




of the west whose type is the mississippi itself which
uniting the streams of the most distant and opposite
zones pours them along helter-skelter in one cosmopolitan
and confident tide







in which a variety of characters appear


in the forward part of the boat not the least attractive
object for a time was a grotesque negro cripple in
two-cloth attire and an old coal-sifter of a tamborine
in his hand who owing to something wrong about his
legs was in effect cut down to the stature of a newfoundland
dog his knotted black fleece and good-natured
honest black face rubbing against the upper
part of people's thighs as he made shift to shuffle about
making music such as it was and raising a smile even
from the gravest it was curious to see him out of his
very deformity indigence and houselessness so cheerily
endured raising mirth in some of that crowd whose
own purses hearths hearts all their possessions sound
limbs included could not make gay

what is your name old boy said a purple-faced
drover putting his large purple hand on the cripple's
bushy wool as if it were the curled forehead of a black
steer

der black guinea dey calls me sar

and who is your master guinea

oh sar i am der dog widout massa




a free dog eh well on your account i'm sorry
for that guinea dogs without masters fare hard

so dey do sar so dey do but you see sar dese
here legs what ge'mman want to own dese here
legs

but where do you live

all long shore sar dough now i'se going to
see brodder at der landing but chiefly i libs in der
city

st louis ah where do you sleep there of
nights

on der floor of der good baker's oven sar

in an oven whose pray what baker i should
like to know bakes such black bread in his oven
alongside of his nice white rolls too who is that
too charitable baker pray

dar he be with a broad grin lifting his tambourine
high over his head

the sun is the baker eh

yes sar in der city dat good baker warms der stones
for dis ole darkie when he sleeps out on der pabements
o nights

but that must be in the summer only old boy
how about winter when the cold cossacks come
clattering and jingling how about winter old
boy

den dis poor old darkie shakes werry bad i tell
you sar oh sar oh don't speak ob der winter he
added with a reminiscent shiver shuffling off into the
thickest of the crowd like a half-frozen black sheep




nudging itself a cozy berth in the heart of the white
flock

thus far not very many pennies had been given him
and used at last to his strange looks the less polite passengers
of those in that part of the boat began to get
their fill of him as a curious object when suddenly the
negro more than revived their first interest by an expedient
which whether by chance or design was a singular
temptation at once to diversion and charity though
even more than his crippled limbs it put him on a
canine footing in short as in appearance he seemed
a dog so now in a merry way like a dog he began to
be treated still shuffling among the crowd now and
then he would pause throwing back his head and
opening his mouth like an elephant for tossed apples
at a menagerie when making a space before him people
would have a bout at a strange sort of pitch-penny
game the cripple's mouth being at once target and
purse and he hailing each expertly-caught copper with
a cracked bravura from his tambourine to be the subject
of alms-giving is trying and to feel in duty bound
to appear cheerfully grateful under the trial must be
still more so but whatever his secret emotions he
swallowed them while still retaining each copper this
side the oesophagus and nearly always he grinned
and only once or twice did he wince which was when
certain coins tossed by more playful almoners came
inconveniently nigh to his teeth an accident whose
unwelcomeness was not unedged by the circumstance
that the pennies thus thrown proved buttons




while this game of charity was yet at its height a
limping gimlet-eyed sour-faced person   it may be
some discharged custom-house officer who suddenly
stripped of convenient means of support had concluded
to be avenged on government and humanity
by making himself miserable for life either by hating
or suspecting everything and everybody   this shallow
unfortunate after sundry sorry observations of the negro
began to croak out something about his deformity
being a sham got up for financial purposes which immediately
threw a damp upon the frolic benignities of
the pitch-penny players

but that these suspicions came from one who himself
on a wooden leg went halt this did not appear to
strike anybody present that cripples above all men
should be companionable or at least refrain from picking
a fellow-limper to pieces in short should have a
little sympathy in common misfortune seemed not to
occur to the company

meantime the negro's countenance before marked
with even more than patient good-nature drooped
into a heavy-hearted expression full of the most
painful distress so far abased beneath its proper
physical level that newfoundland-dog face turned in
passively hopeless appeal as if instinct told it that the
right or the wrong might not have overmuch to do
with whatever wayward mood superior intelligences
might yield to

but instinct though knowing is yet a teacher set
below reason which itself says in the grave words of




lysander in the comedy after puck has made a sage of
him with his spell   

the will of man is by his reason swayed
so that suddenly change as people may in their dispositions
it is not always waywardness but improved
judgment which as in lysander's case or the present
operates with them

yes they began to scrutinize the negro curiously
enough when emboldened by this evidence of the
efficacy of his words the wooden-legged man hobbled
up to the negro and with the air of a beadle would
to prove his alleged imposture on the spot have stripped
him and then driven him away but was prevented
by the crowd's clamor now taking part with the poor
fellow against one who had just before turned nearly
all minds the other way so he with the wooden leg
was forced to retire when the rest finding themselves
left sole judges in the case could not resist the opportunity
of acting the part not because it is a human
weakness to take pleasure in sitting in judgment upon
one in a box as surely this unfortunate negro now
was but that it strangely sharpens human perceptions
when instead of standing by and having their
fellow-feelings touched by the sight of an alleged culprit
severely handled by some one justiciary a crowd
suddenly come to be all justiciaries in the same case
themselves as in arkansas once a man proved guilty
by law of murder but whose condemnation was deemed




unjust by the people so that they rescued him to try
him themselves whereupon they as it turned out
found him even guiltier than the court had done and
forthwith proceeded to execution so that the gallows
presented the truly warning spectacle of a man hanged
by his friends

but not to such extremities or anything like them
did the present crowd come they for the time being
content with putting the negro fairly and discreetly to
the question among other things asking him had he
any documentary proof any plain paper about him
attesting that his case was not a spurious one

no no dis poor ole darkie haint none o dem waloable
papers he wailed

but is there not some one who can speak a good
word for you here said a person newly arrived from
another part of the boat a young episcopal clergyman
in a long straight-bodied black coat small in stature
but manly with a clear face and blue eye innocence
tenderness and good sense triumvirate in his air

oh yes oh yes ge'mmen he eagerly answered
as if his memory before suddenly frozen up by cold
charity as suddenly thawed back into fluidity at the
first kindly word oh yes oh yes dar is aboard here
a werry nice good ge'mman wid a weed and a ge'mman
in a gray coat and white tie what knows all about me
and a ge'mman wid a big book too and a yarb-doctor
and a ge'mman in a yaller west and a ge'mman wid a
brass plate and a ge'mman in a wiolet robe and a
ge'mman as is a sodjer and ever so many good kind




honest ge'mmen more aboard what knows me and will
speak for me god bress em yes and what knows me
as well as dis poor old darkie knows hisself god bress
him oh find em find em he earnestly added and
let em come quick and show you all ge'mmen dat dis
poor ole darkie is werry well wordy of all you kind
ge'mmen's kind confidence

but how are we to find all these people in this
great crowd was the question of a bystander umbrella
in hand a middle-aged person a country merchant
apparently whose natural good-feeling had been
made at least cautious by the unnatural ill-feeling of
the discharged custom-house officer

where are we to find them half-rebukefully
echoed the young episcopal clergymen i will go
find one to begin with he quickly added and with
kind haste suiting the action to the word away he
went

wild goose chase croaked he with the wooden
leg now again drawing nigh don't believe there's
a soul of them aboard did ever beggar have such
heaps of fine friends he can walk fast enough when
he tries a good deal faster than i but he can lie yet
faster he's some white operator betwisted and
painted up for a decoy he and his friends are all
humbugs

have you no charity friend here in self-subdued
tones singularly contrasted with his unsubdued person
said a methodist minister advancing a tall muscular
martial-looking man a tennessean by birth who in the




mexican war had been volunteer chaplain to a volunteer
rifle-regiment

charity is one thing and truth is another rejoined
he with the wooden leg he's a rascal i say

but why not friend put as charitable a construction
as one can upon the poor fellow said the soldierlike
methodist with increased difficulty maintaining a
pacific demeanor towards one whose own asperity
seemed so little to entitle him to it he looks honest
don't he

looks are one thing and facts are another snapped
out the other perversely and as to your constructions
what construction can you put upon a rascal but
that a rascal he is

be not such a canada thistle urged the methodist
with something less of patience than before charity
man charity

to where it belongs with your charity to heaven
with it again snapped out the other diabolically
here on earth true charity dotes and false charity
plots who betrays a fool with a kiss the charitable
fool has the charity to believe is in love with him
and the charitable knave on the stand gives charitable
testimony for his comrade in the box

surely friend returned the noble methodist with
much ado restraining his still waxing indignation   
surely to say the least you forget yourself apply
it home he continued with exterior calmness tremulous
with inkept emotion suppose now i should
exercise no charity in judging your own character by




the words which have fallen from you what sort of
vile pitiless man do you think i would take you for

no doubt   with a grin   some such pitiless man
as has lost his piety in much the same way that the
jockey loses his honesty

and how is that friend still conscientiously
holding back the old adam in him as if it were a
mastiff he had by the neck

never you mind how it is   with a sneer but
all horses aint virtuous no more than all men kind
and come close to and much dealt with some things
are catching when you find me a virtuous jockey i
will find you a benevolent wise man

some insinuation there

more fool you that are puzzled by it

reprobate cried the other his indignation now
at last almost boiling over godless reprobate if
charity did not restrain me i could call you by names
you deserve

could you indeed with an insolent sneer

yea and teach you charity on the spot cried the
goaded methodist suddenly catching this exasperating
opponent by his shabby coat-collar and shaking him
till his timber-toe clattered on the deck like a nine-pin
you took me for a non-combatant did you   thought
seedy coward that you are that you could abuse a
christian with impunity you find your mistake   
with another hearty shake

well said and better done church militant cried
a voice




the white cravat against the world cried another

bravo bravo chorused many voices with like
enthusiasm taking sides with the resolute champion

you fools cried he with the wooden leg writhing
himself loose and inflamedly turning upon the
throng you flock of fools under this captain of fools
in this ship of fools

with which exclamations followed by idle threats
against his admonisher this condign victim to justice
hobbled away as disdaining to hold further argument
with such a rabble but his scorn was more than
repaid by the hisses that chased him in which the
brave methodist satisfied with the rebuke already
administered was to omit still better reasons too
magnanimous to join all he said was pointing towards
the departing recusant there he shambles off
on his one lone leg emblematic of his one-sided view
of humanity

but trust your painted decoy retorted the other
from a distance pointing back to the black cripple
and i have my revenge

but we aint agoing to trust him shouted back a
voice

so much the better he jeered back look
you he added coming to a dead halt where he was
look you i have been called a canada thistle very
good and a seedy one still better and the seedy
canada thistle has been pretty well shaken among ye
best of all dare say some seed has been shaken out




and won't it spring though and when it does spring
do you cut down the young thistles and won't they
spring the more it's encouraging and coaxing em
now when with my thistles your farms shall be well
stocked why then   you may abandon em

what does all that mean now asked the country
merchant staring

nothing the foiled wolf's parting howl said the
methodist spleen much spleen which is the rickety
child of his evil heart of unbelief it has made him
mad i suspect him for one naturally reprobate oh
friends raising his arms as in the pulpit oh beloved
how are we admonished by the melancholy spectacle of
this raver let us profit by the lesson and is it not
this that if next to mistrusting providence there be
aught that man should pray against it is against mistrusting
his fellow-man i have been in mad-houses
full of tragic mopers and seen there the end of suspicion
the cynic in the moody madness muttering in
the corner for years a barren fixture there head lopped
over gnawing his own lip vulture of himself
while by fits and starts from the corner opposite came
the grimace of the idiot at him

what an example whispered one

might deter timon was the response

oh oh good ge'mmen have you no confidence in
dis poor ole darkie now wailed the returning negro
who during the late scene had stumped apart in
alarm

confidence in you echoed he who had whispered




with abruptly changed air turning short round that
remains to be seen

i tell you what it is ebony in similarly changed
tones said he who had responded to the whisperer
yonder churl pointing toward the wooden leg in
the distance is no doubt a churlish fellow enough
and i would not wish to be like him but that is no
reason why you may not be some sort of black jeremy
diddler

no confidence in dis poor ole darkie den

before giving you our confidence said a third
we will wait the report of the kind gentleman who
went in search of one of your friends who was to speak
for you

very likely in that case said a fourth we shall
wait here till christmas shouldn't wonder did we not
see that kind gentleman again after seeking awhile in
vain he will conclude he has been made a fool of and
so not return to us for pure shame fact is i begin to
feel a little qualmish about the darkie myself something
queer about this darkie depend upon it

once more the negro wailed and turning in despair
from the last speaker imploringly caught the methodist
by the skirt of his coat but a change had come over
that before impassioned intercessor with an irresolute
and troubled air he mutely eyed the suppliant
against whom somehow by what seemed instinctive
influences the distrusts first set on foot were now generally
reviving and if anything with added severity

no confidence in dis poor ole darkie yet again




wailed the negro letting go the coat-skirts and turning
appealingly all round him

yes my poor fellow i have confidence in you
now exclaimed the country merchant before named
whom the negro's appeal coming so piteously on the
heel of pitilessness seemed at last humanely to have
decided in his favor and here here is some proof
of my trust with which tucking his umbrella under
his arm and diving down his hand into his pocket he
fished forth a purse and accidentally along with it
his business card which unobserved dropped to the
deck here here my poor fellow he continued
extending a half dollar

not more grateful for the coin than the kindness the
cripple's face glowed like a polished copper saucepan
and shuffling a pace nigher with one upstretched hand
he received the alms while as unconsciously his one
advanced leather stump covered the card

done in despite of the general sentiment the good
deed of the merchant was not perhaps without its
unwelcome return from the crowd since that good deed
seemed somehow to convey to them a sort of reproach
still again and more pertinaciously than ever the cry
arose against the negro and still again he wailed forth
his lament and appeal among other things repeating
that the friends of whom already he had partially run
off the list would freely speak for him would anybody
go find them

why don't you go find em yourself demanded a
gruff boatman




how can i go find em myself dis poor ole
game-legged darkie's friends must come to him oh
whar whar is dat good friend of dis darkie's dat good
man wid de weed

at this point a steward ringing a bell came along
summoning all persons who had not got their tickets to
step to the captain's office an announcement which
speedily thinned the throng about the black cripple
who himself soon forlornly stumped out of sight
probably on much the same errand as the rest






renewal of old acquantance


how do you do mr roberts

eh

don't you know me

no certainly

the crowd about the captain's office having in good
time melted away the above encounter took place in
one of the side balconies astern between a man in
mourning clean and respectable but none of the glossiest
a long weed on his hat and the country-merchant before-mentioned
whom with the familiarity of an old
acquaintance the former had accosted

is it possible my dear sir resumed he with the
weed that you do not recall my countenance why
yours i recall distinctly as if but half an hour instead of
half an age had passed since i saw you don't you
recall me now look harder

in my conscience   truly   i protest honestly
bewildered bless my soul sir i don't know you   
really really but stay stay he hurriedly added not
without gratification glancing up at the crape on the
stranger's hat stay   yes   seems to me though i have




not the pleasure of personally knowing you yet i am
pretty sure i have at least heard of you and recently
too quite recently a poor negro aboard here referred
to you among others for a character i think

oh the cripple poor fellow i know him well
they found me i have said all i could for him i think
i abated their distrust would i could have been of
more substantial service and apropos sir he added
now that it strikes me allow me to ask whether the
circumstance of one man however humble referring for a
character to another man however afflicted does not
argue more or less of moral worth in the latter

the good merchant looked puzzled

still you don't recall my countenance

still does truth compel me to say that i cannot
despite my best efforts was the reluctantly-candid reply

can i be so changed look at me or is it i who
am mistaken   are you not sir henry roberts forwarding
merchant of wheeling pennsylvania pray
now if you use the advertisement of business cards
and happen to have one with you just look at it and see
whether you are not the man i take you for

why a bit chafed perhaps i hope i know myself

and yet self-knowledge is thought by some not so
easy who knows my dear sir but for a time you may
have taken yourself for somebody else stranger things
have happened

the good merchant stared

to come to particulars my dear sir i met you now




some six years back at brade brothers cos office i
think i was traveling for a philadelphia house the
senior brade introduced us you remember some business-chat
followed then you forced me home with you
to a family tea and a family time we had have you
forgotten about the urn and what i said about werter's
charlotte and the bread and butter and that capital
story you told of the large loaf a hundred times since
i have laughed over it at least you must recall my
name   ringman john ringman

large loaf invited you to tea ringman ringman
ring ring

ah sir sadly smiling don't ring the changes that
way i see you have a faithless memory mr roberts
but trust in the faithfulness of mine

well to tell the truth in some things my memory
aint of the very best was the honest rejoinder but
still he perplexedly added still i   

oh sir suffice it that it is as i say doubt not that
we are all well acquainted

but   but i don't like this going dead against my
own memory i   

but didn't you admit my dear sir that in some
things this memory of yours is a little faithless now
those who have faithless memories should they not have
some little confidence in the less faithless memories of
others

but of this friendly chat and tea i have not the
slightest   

i see i see quite erased from the tablet pray




sir with a sudden illumination about six years back
did it happen to you to receive any injury on the head
surprising effects have arisen from such a cause not
alone unconsciousness as to events for a greater or less
time immediately subsequent to the injury but likewise   
strange to add   oblivion entire and incurable as to
events embracing a longer or shorter period immediately
preceding it that is when the mind at the time
was perfectly sensible of them and fully competent also
to register them in the memory and did in fact so do
but all in vain for all was afterwards bruised out by
the injury

after the first start the merchant listened with what
appeared more than ordinary interest the other proceeded

in my boyhood i was kicked by a horse and lay
insensible for a long time upon recovering what a
blank no faintest trace in regard to how i had come
near the horse or what horse it was or where it was or
that it was a horse at all that had brought me to that
pass for the knowledge of those particulars i am indebted
solely to my friends in whose statements i need
not say i place implicit reliance since particulars of
some sort there must have been and why should they
deceive me you see sir the mind is ductile very
much so but images ductilely received into it need a
certain time to harden and bake in their impressions
otherwise such a casualty as i speak of will in an instant
obliterate them as though they had never been we
are but clay sir potter's clay as the good book says




clay feeble and too-yielding clay but i will not philosophize
tell me was it your misfortune to receive
any concussion upon the brain about the period i speak
of if so i will with pleasure supply the void in your
memory by more minutely rehearsing the circumstances
of our acquaintance

the growing interest betrayed by the merchant had
not relaxed as the other proceeded after some hesitation
indeed something more than hesitation he confessed
that though he had never received any injury of
the sort named yet about the time in question he had
in fact been taken with a brain fever losing his mind
completely for a considerable interval he was continuing
when the stranger with much animation exclaimed

there now you see i was not wholly mistaken
that brain fever accounts for it all

nay but   

pardon me mr roberts respectfully interrupting
him but time is short and i have something private
and particular to say to you allow me

mr roberts good man could but acquiesce and the
two having silently walked to a less public spot the manner
of the man with the weed suddenly assumed a seriousness
almost painful what might be called a writhing
expression stole over him he seemed struggling with
some disastrous necessity inkept he made one or two
attempts to speak but words seemed to choke him
his companion stood in humane surprise wondering
what was to come at length with an effort




mastering his feelings in a tolerably composed tone he
spoke

if i remember you are a mason mr roberts

yes yes

averting himself a moment as to recover from a return
of agitation the stranger grasped the other's hand
and would you not loan a brother a shilling if he
needed it

the merchant started apparently almost as if to retreat

ah mr roberts i trust you are not one of those
business men who make a business of never having to
do with unfortunates for god's sake don't leave me
i have something on my heart   on my heart under
deplorable circumstances thrown among strangers utter
strangers i want a friend in whom i may confide
yours mr roberts is almost the first known face i've
seen for many weeks

it was so sudden an outburst the interview offered
such a contrast to the scene around that the merchant
though not used to be very indiscreet yet being not
entirely inhumane remained not entirely unmoved

the other still tremulous resumed

i need not say sir how it cuts me to the soul to
follow up a social salutation with such words as have
just been mine i know that i jeopardize your good opinion
but i can't help it necessity knows no law and
heeds no risk sir we are masons one more step aside
i will tell you my story

in a low half-suppressed tone he began it judging




from his auditor's expression it seemed to be a tale of
singular interest involving calamities against which no
integrity no forethought no energy no genius no piety
could guard

at every disclosure the hearer's commiseration increased
no sentimental pity as the story went on
he drew from his wallet a bank note but after a while
at some still more unhappy revelation changed it for
another probably of a somewhat larger amount which
when the story was concluded with an air studiously
disclamatory of alms-giving he put into the stranger's
hands who on his side with an air studiously disclamatory
of alms-taking put it into his pocket

assistance being received the stranger's manner assumed
a kind and degree of decorum which under the
circumstances seemed almost coldness after some words
not over ardent and yet not exactly inappropriate he
took leave making a bow which had one knows not
what of a certain chastened independence about it as
if misery however burdensome could not break down
self-respect nor gratitude however deep humiliate a
gentleman

he was hardly yet out of sight when he paused as if
thinking then with hastened steps returning to the
merchant i am just reminded that the president who
is also transfer-agent of the black rapids coal company
happens to be on board here and having been subpoe
naed as witness in a stock case on the docket in kentucky
has his transfer-book with him a month since
in a panic contrived by artful alarmists some credulous




stock-holders sold out but to frustrate the aim of the
alarmists the company previously advised of their
scheme so managed it as to get into its own hands those
sacrificed shares resolved that since a spurious panic
must be the panic-makers should be no gainers by it
the company i hear is now ready but not anxious to
redispose of those shares and having obtained them at
their depressed value will now sell them at par though
prior to the panic they were held at a handsome figure
above that the readiness of the company to do this
is not generally known is shown by the fact that the
stock still stands on the transfer-book in the company's
name offering to one in funds a rare chance for investment
for the panic subsiding more and more every
day it will daily be seen how it originated confidence
will be more than restored there will be a reaction
from the stock's descent its rise will be higher than from
no fall the holders trusting themselves to fear no second
fate

having listened at first with curiosity at last with
interest the merchant replied to the effect that some
time since through friends concerned with it he had
heard of the company and heard well of it but was ignorant
that there had latterly been fluctuations he added
that he was no speculator that hitherto he had avoided
having to do with stocks of any sort but in the present
case he really felt something like being tempted pray
in conclusion do you think that upon a pinch anything
could be transacted on board here with the transfer-agent
are you acquainted with him




not personally i but happened to hear that he
was a passenger for the rest though it might be
somewhat informal the gentleman might not object to
doing a little business on board along the mississippi
you know business is not so ceremonious as at the
east

true returned the merchant and looked down a
moment in thought then raising his head quickly said
in a tone not so benign as his wonted one this would
seem a rare chance indeed why upon first hearing it
did you not snatch at it i mean for yourself

i   would it had been possible

not without some emotion was this said and not
without some embarrassment was the reply ah yes
i had forgotten

upon this the stranger regarded him with mild gravity
not a little disconcerting the more so as there was
in it what seemed the aspect not alone of the superior
but as it were the rebuker which sort of bearing in
a beneficiary towards his benefactor looked strangely
enough none the less that somehow it sat not altogether
unbecomingly upon the beneficiary being free
from anything like the appearance of assumption and
mixed with a kind of painful conscientiousness as
though nothing but a proper sense of what he owed to
himself swayed him at length he spoke

to reproach a penniless man with remissness in not
availing himself of an opportunity for pecuniary investment   
but no no it was forgetfulness and this
charity will impute to some lingering effect of that




unfortunate brain-fever which as to occurrences dating
yet further back disturbed mr roberts's memory still
more seriously

as to that said the merchant rallying i am
not   

pardon me but you must admit that just now an
unpleasant distrust however vague was yours ah
shallow as it is yet how subtle a thing is suspicion
which at times can invade the humanest of hearts and
wisest of heads but enough my object sir in calling
your attention to this stock is by way of acknowledgment
of your goodness i but seek to be grateful
if my information leads to nothing you must remember
the motive

he bowed and finally retired leaving mr roberts
not wholly without self-reproach for having momentarily
indulged injurious thoughts against one who it was
evident was possessed of a self-respect which forbade
his indulging them himself






the man with the weed makes it an even question whether
he be a great sage or a great simpleton


 well there is sorrow in the world but goodness
too and goodness that is not greenness either no more
than sorrow is dear good man poor beating heart

it was the man with the weed not very long after
quitting the merchant murmuring to himself with his
hand to his side like one with the heart-disease

meditation over kindness received seemed to have
softened him something too it may be beyond what
might perhaps have been looked for from one whose
unwonted self-respect in the hour of need and in the act
of being aided might have appeared to some not wholly
unlike pride out of place and pride in any place is
seldom very feeling but the truth perhaps is that
those who are least touched with that vice besides being
not unsusceptible to goodness are sometimes the
ones whom a ruling sense of propriety makes appear
cold if not thankless under a favor for at such a
time to be full of warm earnest words and heart-felt
protestations is to create a scene and well-bred people
dislike few things more than that which would




seem to look as if the world did not relish earnestness
but not so because the world being earnest itself likes
an earnest scene and an earnest man very well but
only in their place   the stage see what sad work they
make of it who ignorant of this flame out in irish
enthusiasm and with irish sincerity to a benefactor
who if a man of sense and respectability as well as
kindliness can but be more or less annoyed by it
and if of a nervously fastidious nature as some are
may be led to think almost as much less favorably of
the beneficiary paining him by his gratitude as if he had
been guilty of its contrary instead only of an indiscretion
but beneficiaries who know better though they
may feel as much if not more neither inflict such pain
nor are inclined to run any risk of so doing and these
being wise are the majority by which one sees how
inconsiderate those persons are who from the absence
of its officious manifestations in the world complain that
there is not much gratitude extant when the truth is
that there is as much of it as there is of modesty but
both being for the most part votarists of the shade for
the most part keep out of sight

what started this was to account if necessary for
the changed air of the man with the weed who throwing
off in private the cold garb of decorum and so giving
warmly loose to his genuine heart seemed almost
transformed into another being this subdued air of
softness too was toned with melancholy melancholy
unreserved a thing which however at variance with
propriety still the more attested his earnestness for




one knows not how it is but it sometimes happens that
where earnestness is there also is melancholy

at the time he was leaning over the rail at the boat's
side in his pensiveness unmindful of another pensive
figure near   a young gentleman with a swan-neck
wearing a lady-like open shirt collar thrown back and
tied with a black ribbon from a square tableted
broach curiously engraved with greek characters he
seemed a collegian   not improbably a sophomore   on
his travels possibly his first a small book bound in
roman vellum was in his hand

overhearing his murmuring neighbor the youth
regarded him with some surprise not to say interest
but singularly for a collegian being apparently of a
retiring nature he did not speak when the other still
more increased his diffidence by changing from soliloquy
to colloquy in a manner strangely mixed of familiarity
and pathos

ah who is this you did not hear me my young
friend did you why you too look sad my melancholy
is not catching

sir sir stammered the other

pray now with a sort of sociable sorrowfulness
slowly sliding along the rail pray now my young
friend what volume have you there give me leave
gently drawing it from him tacitus then opening
it at random read in general a black and shameful
period lies before me dear young sir touching
his arm alarmedly don't read this book it is poison
moral poison even were there truth in tacitus




such truth would have the operation of falsity and so
still be poison moral poison too well i know this
tacitus in my college-days he came near souring me
into cynicism yes i began to turn down my collar
and go about with a disdainfully joyless expression

sir sir i   i   

trust me now young friend perhaps you think
that tacitus like me is only melancholy but he's more   
he's ugly a vast difference young sir between the
melancholy view and the ugly the one may show the
world still beautiful not so the other the one may be
compatible with benevolence the other not the one
may deepen insight the other shallows it drop tacitus
phrenologically my young friend you would
seem to have a well-developed head and large but
cribbed within the ugly view the tacitus view your
large brain like your large ox in the contracted field
will but starve the more and don't dream as some of
you students may that by taking this same ugly view
the deeper meanings of the deeper books will so alone
become revealed to you drop tacitus his subtlety
is falsity to him in his double-refined anatomy of
human nature is well applied the scripture saying   
there is a subtle man and the same is deceived drop
tacitus come now let me throw the book overboard

sir i   i   

not a word i know just what is in your mind and
that is just what i am speaking to yes learn from me
that though the sorrows of the world are great its




wickedness   that is its ugliness   is small much cause
to pity man little to distrust him i myself have known
adversity and know it still but for that do i turn
cynic no no it is small beer that sours to my
fellow-creatures i owe alleviations so whatever i
may have undergone it but deepens my confidence in
my kind now then winningly this book   will
you let me drown it for you

really sir   i   

i see i see but of course you read tacitus in order
to aid you in understanding human nature   as if truth
was ever got at by libel my young friend if to know
human nature is your object drop tacitus and go north
to the cemeteries of auburn and greenwood

upon my word i   i   

nay i foresee all that but you carry tacitus
that shallow tacitus what do i carry see   producing
a pocket-volume   akenside   his pleasures
of imagination one of these days you will know it
whatever our lot we should read serene and cheery
books fitted to inspire love and trust but tacitus i
have long been of opinion that these classics are the bane
of colleges for   not to hint of the immorality of ovid
horace anacreon and the rest and the dangerous theology
of eschylus and others   where will one find views
so injurious to human nature as in thucydides juvenal
lucian but more particularly tacitus when i consider
that ever since the revival of learning these classics
have been the favorites of successive generations of students
and studious men i tremble to think of that mass




of unsuspected heresy on every vital topic which for
centuries must have simmered unsurmised in the heart
of christendom but tacitus   he is the most extraordinary
example of a heretic not one iota of confidence in
his kind what a mockery that such an one should be
reputed wise and thucydides be esteemed the statesman's
manual but tacitus   i hate tacitus not
though i trust with the hate that sins but a righteous
hate without confidence himself tacitus destroys it
in all his readers destroys confidence paternal confidence
of which god knows that there is in this world
none to spare for comparatively inexperienced as you
are my dear young friend did you never observe how
little very little confidence there is i mean between
man and man   more particularly between stranger and
stranger in a sad world it is the saddest fact confidence
i have sometimes almost thought that confidence
is fled that confidence is the new astrea   emigrated   
vanished   gone then softly sliding nearer
with the softest air quivering down and looking up
could you now my dear young sir under such circumstances
by way of experiment simply have confidence
in me 

from the outset the sophomore as has been seen
had struggled with an ever-increasing embarrassment
arising perhaps from such strange remarks coming from
a stranger   such persistent and prolonged remarks too
in vain had he more than once sought to break the
spell by venturing a deprecatory or leave-taking word
in vain somehow the stranger fascinated him little




wonder then that when the appeal came he could
hardly speak but as before intimated being apparently
of a retiring nature abruptly retired from the spot leaving
the chagrined stranger to wander away in the opposite
direction







at the outset of which certain passengers prove deaf
to the call of charity


   you   pish why will the captain suffer these
begging fellows on board

these pettish words were breathed by a well-to-do
gentleman in a ruby-colored velvet vest and with a ruby-colored
cheek a ruby-headed cane in his hand to a man in
a gray coat and white tie who shortly after the interview
last described had accosted him for contributions to a
widow and orphan asylum recently founded among the
seminoles upon a cursory view this last person might
have seemed like the man with the weed one of the less
unrefined children of misfortune but on a closer observation
his countenance revealed little of sorrow though
much of sanctity

with added words of touchy disgust the well-to-do
gentleman hurried away but though repulsed and
rudely the man in gray did not reproach for a time
patiently remaining in the chilly loneliness to which he
had been left his countenance however not without
token of latent though chastened reliance




at length an old gentleman somewhat bulky drew
nigh and from him also a contribution was sought

look you coming to a dead halt and scowling
upon him look you swelling his bulk out before
him like a swaying balloon look you you on others
behalf ask for money you a fellow with a face as long
as my arm hark ye now there is such a thing as
gravity and in condemned felons it may be genuine
but of long faces there are three sorts that of grief's
drudge that of the lantern-jawed man and that of the
impostor you know best which yours is

heaven give you more charity sir

and you less hypocrisy sir

with which words the hard-hearted old gentleman
marched off

while the other still stood forlorn the young clergyman
before introduced passing that way catching a
chance sight of him seemed suddenly struck by some
recollection and after a moment's pause hurried up
with your pardon but shortly since i was all over
looking for you

for me as marveling that one of so little account
should be sought for

yes for you do you know anything about the
negro apparently a cripple aboard here is he or is
he not what he seems to be

ah poor guinea have you too been distrusted
you upon whom nature has placarded the evidence of
your claims

then you do really know him and he is quite




worthy it relieves me to hear it   much relieves me
come let us go find him and see what can be done

another instance that confidence may come too
late i am sorry to say that at the last landing i myself   
just happening to catch sight of him on the gangway-plank   
assisted the cripple ashore no time to
talk only to help he may not have told you but he
has a brother in that vicinity

really i regret his going without my seeing him
again regret it more perhaps than you can readily think
you see shortly after leaving st louis he was on the
forecastle and there with many others i saw him and
put trust in him so much so that to convince those
who did not i at his entreaty went in search of you
you being one of several individuals he mentioned and
whose personal appearance he more or less described
individuals who he said would willingly speak for him
but after diligent search not finding you and catching
no glimpse of any of the others he had enumerated
doubts were at last suggested but doubts indirectly
originating as i can but think from prior distrust unfeelingly
proclaimed by another still certain it is i
began to suspect

ha ha ha

a sort of laugh more like a groan than a laugh and
yet somehow it seemed intended for a laugh

both turned and the young clergyman started at
seeing the wooden-legged man close behind him morosely
grave as a criminal judge with a mustard-plaster
on his back in the present case the mustard-plaster




might have been the memory of certain recent biting
rebuffs and mortifications

wouldn't think it was i who laughed would you

but who was it you laughed at or rather tried to
laugh at demanded the young clergyman flushing
me

neither you nor any one within a thousand miles
of you but perhaps you don't believe it

if he were of a suspicious temper he might not
interposed the man in gray calmly it is one of the
imbecilities of the suspicious person to fancy that every
stranger however absent-minded he sees so much as
smiling or gesturing to himself in any odd sort of way
is secretly making him his butt in some moods the
movements of an entire street as the suspicious man
walks down it will seem an express pantomimic jeer at
him in short the suspicious man kicks himself with
his own foot

whoever can do that ten to one he saves other
folks sole-leather said the wooden-legged man with a
crusty attempt at humor but with augmented grin
and squirm turning directly upon the young clergyman
you still think it was you i was laughing at just now
to prove your mistake i will tell you what i was
laughing at a story i happened to call to mind just
then

whereupon in his porcupine way and with sarcastic
details unpleasant to repeat he related a story which
might perhaps in a good-natured version be rendered
as follows




a certain frenchman of new orleans an old man
less slender in purse than limb happening to attend
the theatre one evening was so charmed with the
character of a faithful wife as there represented to
the life that nothing would do but he must marry upon
it so marry he did a beautiful girl from tennessee who
had first attracted his attention by her liberal mould
and was subsequently recommended to him through her
kin for her equally liberal education and disposition
though large the praise proved not too much for
ere long rumor more than corroborated it by whispering
that the lady was liberal to a fault but though various
circumstances which by most benedicts would have
been deemed all but conclusive were duly recited to the
old frenchman by his friends yet such was his confidence
that not a syllable would he credit till chancing
one night to return unexpectedly from a journey upon
entering his apartment a stranger burst from the alcove
begar cried he now i begin to suspec

his story told the wooden-legged man threw back
his head and gave vent to a long gasping rasping sort
of taunting cry intolerable as that of a high-pressure
engine jeering off steam and that done with apparent
satisfaction hobbled away

who is that scoffer said the man in gray not without
warmth who is he who even were truth on his
tongue his way of speaking it would make truth almost
offensive as falsehood who is he

he who i mentioned to you as having boasted his
suspicion of the negro replied the young clergyman




recovering from disturbance in short the person
to whom i ascribe the origin of my own distrust he
maintained that guinea was some white scoundrel betwisted
and painted up for a decoy yes these were
his very words i think

impossible he could not be so wrong-headed
pray will you call him back and let me ask him if he
were really in earnest

the other complied and at length after no few surly
objections prevailed upon the one-legged individual to
return for a moment upon which the man in gray
thus addressed him this reverend gentleman tells
me sir that a certain cripple a poor negro is by you
considered an ingenious impostor now i am not unaware
that there are some persons in this world who
unable to give better proof of being wise take a strange
delight in showing what they think they have sagaciously
read in mankind by uncharitable suspicions
of them i hope you are not one of these in short
would you tell me now whether you were not merely
joking in the notion you threw out about the negro
would you be so kind

no i won't be so kind i'll be so cruel

as you please about that

well he's just what i said he was

a white masquerading as a black

exactly

the man in gray glanced at the young clergyman a
moment then quietly whispered to him i thought you
represented your friend here as a very distrustful sort of




person but he appears endued with a singular credulity   
tell me sir do you really think that a white could
look the negro so for one i should call it pretty good
acting

not much better than any other man acts

how does all the world act am i for instance
an actor is my reverend friend here too a performer

yes don't you both perform acts to do is to act
so all doers are actors

you trifle   i ask again if a white how could he
look the negro so

never saw the negro-minstrels i suppose

yes but they are apt to overdo the ebony exemplifying
the old saying not more just than charitable that
the devil is never so black as he is painted but his
limbs if not a cripple how could he twist his limbs so

how do other hypocritical beggars twist theirs
easy enough to see how they are hoisted up

the sham is evident then

to the discerning eye with a horrible screw of his
gimlet one

well where is guinea said the man in gray
where is he let us at once find him and refute beyond
cavil this injurious hypothesis

do so cried the one-eyed man i'm just in the
humor now for having him found and leaving the streaks
of these fingers on his paint as the lion leaves the
streaks of his nails on a caffre they wouldn't let me
touch him before yes find him i'll make wool fly
and him after




you forget here said the young clergyman to the
man in gray that yourself helped poor guinea ashore

so i did so i did how unfortunate but look
now to the other i think that without personal proof
i can convince you of your mistake for i put it to
you is it reasonable to suppose that a man with brains
sufficient to act such a part as you say would take all
that trouble and run all that hazard for the mere sake
of those few paltry coppers which i hear was all he
got for his pains if pains they were

that puts the case irrefutably said the young
clergyman with a challenging glance towards the one-legged
man

you two green-horns money you think is the sole
motive to pains and hazard deception and deviltry in
this world how much money did the devil make by
gulling eve

whereupon he hobbled off again with a repetition of
his intolerable jeer

the man in gray stood silently eying his retreat a
while and then turning to his companion said a
bad man a dangerous man a man to be put down in
any christian community   and this was he who was
the means of begetting your distrust ah we should
shut our ears to distrust and keep them open only for its
opposite

you advance a principle which if i had acted upon
it this morning i should have spared myself what i now
feel   that but one man and he with one leg should
have such ill power given him his one sour word




leavening into congenial sourness as to my knowledge
it did the dispositions before sweet enough of a numerous
company but as i hinted with me at the time
his ill words went for nothing the same as now only
afterwards they had effect and i confess this puzzles
me

it should not with humane minds the spirit of
distrust works something as certain potions do it is a
spirit which may enter such minds and yet for a time
longer or shorter lie in them quiescent but only the
more deplorable its ultimate activity

an uncomfortable solution for since that baneful
man did but just now anew drop on me his bane how
shall i be sure that my present exemption from its effects
will be lasting

you cannot be sure but you can strive against it

how

by strangling the least symptom of distrust of any
sort which hereafter upon whatever provocation may
arise in you

i will do so then added as in soliloquy indeed
indeed i was to blame in standing passive under such
influences as that one-legged man's my conscience upbraids
me   the poor negro you see him occasionally
perhaps

no not often though in a few days as it happens
my engagements will call me to the neighborhood of his
present retreat and no doubt honest guinea who is a
grateful soul will come to see me there

then you have been his benefactor




his benefactor i did not say that i have known
him

take this mite hand it to guinea when you see
him say it comes from one who has full belief in his
honesty and is sincerely sorry for having indulged however
transiently in a contrary thought

i accept the trust and by-the-way since you are
of this truly charitable nature you will not turn away
an appeal in behalf of the seminole widow and orphan
asylum

i have not heard of that charity

but recently founded

after a pause the clergyman was irresolutely putting
his hand in his pocket when caught by something in his
companion's expression he eyed him inquisitively almost
uneasily

ah well smiled the other wanly if that subtle
bane we were speaking of but just now is so soon beginning
to work in vain my appeal to you good-by

nay not untouched you do me injustice instead
of indulging present suspicions i had rather make
amends for previous ones here is something for your
asylum not much but every drop helps of course
you have papers

of course producing a memorandum book and
pencil let me take down name and amount we
publish these names and now let me give you a little
history of our asylum and the providential way in
which it was started






a gentleman with gold sleeve-buttons


at an interesting point of the narration and at the
moment when with much curiosity indeed urgency the
narrator was being particularly questioned upon that
point he was as it happened altogether diverted both
from it and his story by just then catching sight of a
gentleman who had been standing in sight from the beginning
but until now as it seemed without being
observed by him

pardon me said he rising but yonder is one
who i know will contribute and largely don't take
it amiss if i quit you

go duty before all things was the conscientious
reply

the stranger was a man of more than winsome aspect
there he stood apart and in repose and yet by his mere
look lured the man in gray from his story much as by
its graciousness of bearing some full-leaved elm alone
in a meadow lures the noon sickleman to throw down
his sheaves and come and apply for the alms of its
shade

but considering that goodness is no such rare thing




among men   the world familiarly know the noun a
common one in every language   it was curious that
what so signalized the stranger and made him look like
a kind of foreigner among the crowd as to some it
make him appear more or less unreal in this portraiture
was but the expression of so prevailent a quality such
goodness seemed his allied with such fortune that so
far as his own personal experience could have gone
scarcely could he have known ill physical or moral
and as for knowing or suspecting the latter in any serious
degree supposing such degree of it to be by observation
or philosophy for that probably his nature by
its opposition imperfectly qualified or from it wholly
exempted for the rest he might have been five and
fifty perhaps sixty but tall rosy between plump and
portly with a primy palmy air and for the time and
place not to hint of his years dressed with a strangely
festive finish and elegance the inner-side of his coat-skirts
was of white satin which might have looked
especially inappropriate had it not seemed less a bit
of mere tailoring than something of an emblem as it
were an involuntary emblem let us say that what
seemed so good about him was not all outside no the
fine covering had a still finer lining upon one hand he
wore a white kid glove but the other hand which was
ungloved looked hardly less white now as the fidle
like most steamboats was upon deck a little soot-streaked
here and there especially about the railings it was a
marvel how under such circumstances these hands retained
their spotlessness but if you watched them




a while you noticed that they avoided touching anything
you noticed in short that a certain negro body-servant
whose hands nature had dyed black perhaps with the
same purpose that millers wear white this negro servant's
hands did most of his master's handling for him
having to do with dirt on his account but not to his
prejudices but if with the same undefiledness of consequences
to himself a gentleman could also sin by
deputy how shocking would that be but it is not
permitted to be and even if it were no judicious moralist
would make proclamation of it

this gentleman therefore there is reason to affirm
was one who like the hebrew governor knew how to
keep his hands clean and who never in his life happened
to be run suddenly against by hurrying house-painter
or sweep in a word one whose very good luck it was
to be a very good man

not that he looked as if he were a kind of wilberforce
at all that superior merit probably was not his nothing
in his manner bespoke him righteous but only
good and though to be good is much below being righteous
and though there is a difference between the two
yet not it is to be hoped so incompatible as that a
righteous man can not be a good man though conversely
in the pulpit it has been with much cogency urged
that a merely good man that is one good merely by his
nature is so far from there by being righteous that
nothing short of a total change and conversion can make
him so which is something which no honest mind
well read in the history of righteousness will care to




deny nevertheless since st paul himself agreeing in a
sense with the pulpit distinction though not altogether
in the pulpit deduction and also pretty plainly intimating
which of the two qualities in question enjoys his
apostolic preference i say since st paul has so meaningly
said that scarcely for a righteous man will
one die yet peradventure for a good man some would
even dare to die therefore when we repeat of this
gentleman that he was only a good man whatever
else by severe censors may be objected to him it is
still to be hoped that his goodness will not at least
be considered criminal in him at all events no man
not even a righteous man would think it quite right to
commit this gentleman to prison for the crime extraordinary
as he might deem it more especially as until
everything could be known there would be some chance
that the gentleman might after all be quite as innocent
of it as he himself

it was pleasant to mark the good man's reception of
the salute of the righteous man that is the man in
gray his inferior apparently not more in the social
scale than in stature like the benign elm again the
good man seemed to wave the canopy of his goodness
over that suitor not in conceited condescension but
with that even amenity of true majesty which can be
kind to any one without stooping to it

to the plea in behalf of the seminole widows and
orphans the gentleman after a question or two duly
answered responded by producing an ample pocket-book
in the good old capacious style of fine green




french morocco and workmanship bound with silk of
the same color not to omit bills crisp with newness
fresh from the bank no muckworms grime upon them
lucre those bills might be but as yet having been kept
unspotted from the world not of the filthy sort placing
now three of those virgin bills in the applicant's
hands he hoped that the smallness of the contribution
would be pardoned to tell the truth and this at last
accounted for his toilet he was bound but a short run
down the river to attend in a festive grove the afternoon
wedding of his niece so did not carry much money
with him

the other was about expressing his thanks when the
gentleman in his pleasant way checked him the gratitude
was on the other side to him he said charity
was in one sense not an effort but a luxury against too
great indulgence in which his steward a humorist had
sometimes admonished him

in some general talk which followed relative to organized
modes of doing good the gentleman expressed
his regrets that so many benevolent societies as there
were here and there isolated in the land should not act
in concert by coming together in the way that already
in each society the individuals composing it had done
which would result he thought in like advantages upon
a larger scale indeed such a confederation might perhaps
be attended with as happy results as politically
attended that of the states

upon his hitherto moderate enough companion this
suggestion had an effect illustrative in a sort of that




notion of socrates that the soul is a harmony for as the
sound of a flute in any particular key will it is said audibly
affect the corresponding chord of any harp in good
tune within hearing just so now did some string in him
respond and with animation

which animation by the way might seem more or
less out of character in the man in gray considering his
unsprightly manner when first introduced had he not
already in certain after colloquies given proof in some
degree of the fact that with certain natures a soberly
continent air at times so far from arguing emptiness of
stuff is good proof it is there and plenty of it because
unwasted and may be used the more effectively too
when opportunity offers what now follows on the
part of the man in gray will still further exemplify perhaps
somewhat strikingly the truth or what appears
to be such of this remark

sir said he eagerly i am before you a project
not dissimilar to yours was by me thrown out at the
world's fair in london

world's fair you there pray how was that

first let me   

nay but first tell me what took you to the fair

i went to exhibit an invalid's easy-chair i had invented

then you have not always been in the charity business

is it not charity to ease human suffering i am
and always have been as i always will be i trust in
the charity business as you call it but charity is not




like a pin one to make the head and the other the
point charity is a work to which a good workman may
be competent in all its branches i invented my protean
easy-chair in odd intervals stolen from meals and
sleep

you call it the protean easy-chair pray describe
it

my protean easy-chair is a chair so all over bejointed
behinged and bepadded everyway so elastic
springy and docile to the airiest touch that in some one
of its endlessly-changeable accommodations of back
seat footboard and arms the most restless body the
body most racked nay i had almost added the most
tormented conscience must somehow and somewhere
find rest believing that i owed it to suffering humanity
to make known such a chair to the utmost i scraped
together my little means and off to the world's fair
with it

you did right but your scheme how did you
come to hit upon that

i was going to tell you after seeing my invention
duly catalogued and placed i gave myself up to pondering
the scene about me as i dwelt upon that shining
pageant of arts and moving concourse of nations and reflected
that here was the pride of the world glorying in
a glass house a sense of the fragility of worldly grandeur
profoundly impressed me and i said to myself
i will see if this occasion of vanity cannot supply a hint
toward a better profit than was designed let some
world-wide good to the world-wide cause be now done




in short inspired by the scene on the fourth day i issued
at the world's fair my prospectus of the world's
charity

quite a thought but pray explain it

the world's charity is to be a society whose members
shall comprise deputies from every charity and mission
extant the one object of the society to be the methodization
of the world's benevolence to which end
the present system of voluntary and promiscuous contribution
to be done away and the society to be
empowered by the various governments to levy annually
one grand benevolence tax upon all mankind as
in augustus csar's time the whole world to come up
to be taxed a tax which for the scheme of it should
be something like the income-tax in england a tax also
as before hinted to be a consolidation-tax of all possible
benevolence taxes as in america here the state-tax
and the county-tax and the town-tax and the
poll-tax are by the assessors rolled into one this tax
according to my tables calculated with care would result
in the yearly raising of a fund little short of eight
hundred millions this fund to be annually applied to
such objects and in such modes as the various charities
and missions in general congress represented might
decree whereby in fourteen years as i estimate there
would have been devoted to good works the sum of
eleven thousand two hundred millions which would
warrant the dissolution of the society as that fund judiciously
expended not a pauper or heathen could remain
the round world over




eleven thousand two hundred millions and all
by passing round a hat as it were

yes i am no fourier the projector of an impossible
scheme but a philanthropist and a financier setting forth
a philanthropy and a finance which are practicable

practicable

yes eleven thousand two hundred millions it
will frighten none but a retail philanthropist what is
it but eight hundred millions for each of fourteen years
now eight hundred millions   what is that to average
it but one little dollar a head for the population of the
planet and who will refuse what turk or dyak
even his own little dollar for sweet charity's sake
eight hundred millions more than that sum is yearly
expended by mankind not only in vanities but miseries
consider that bloody spendthrift war and are
mankind so stupid so wicked that upon the demonstration
of these things they will not amending their ways
devote their superfluities to blessing the world instead
of cursing it eight hundred millions they have
not to make it it is theirs already they have but to
direct it from ill to good and to this scarce a self-denial
is demanded actually they would not in the
mass be one farthing the poorer for it as certainly would
they be all the better and happier don't you see
but admit as you must that mankind is not mad and
my project is practicable for what creature but a
madman would not rather do good than ill when it is
plain that good or ill it must return upon himself

your sort of reasoning said the good gentleman




adjusting his gold sleeve-buttons seems all reasonable
enough but with mankind it wont do

then mankind are not reasoning beings if reason
wont do with them

that is not to the purpose by-the-way from the
manner in which you alluded to the world's census it
would appear that according to your world-wide scheme
the pauper not less than the nabob is to contribute to
the relief of pauperism and the heathen not less than
the christian to the conversion of heathenism how is
that

why that   pardon me   is quibbling now no
philanthropist likes to be opposed with quibbling

well i won't quibble any more but after all if
i understand your project there is little specially new
in it further than the magnifying of means now in
operation

magnifying and energizing for one thing missions
i would thoroughly reform missions i would
quicken with the wall street spirit

the wall street spirit

yes for if confessedly certain spiritual ends are to
be gained but through the auxiliary agency of worldly
means then to the surer gaining of such spiritual ends
the example of worldly policy in worldly projects should
not by spiritual projectors be slighted in brief the
conversion of the heathen so far at least as depending
on human effort would by the world's charity be let
out on contract so much by bid for converting india
so much for borneo so much for africa competition




allowed stimulus would be given there would be no
lethargy of monopoly we should have no mission-house
or tract-house of which slanderers could with any
plausibility say that it had degenerated in its clerkships
into a sort of custom-house but the main point is the
archimedean money-power that would be brought to
bear

you mean the eight hundred million power

yes you see this doing good to the world by
driblets amounts to just nothing i am for doing good
to the world with a will i am for doing good to the
world once for all and having done with it do but
think my dear sir of the eddies and malstroms of
pagans in china people here have no conception of
it of a frosty morning in hong kong pauper pagans
are found dead in the streets like so many nipped peas
in a bin of peas to be an immortal being in china is
no more distinction than to be a snow-flake in a snow-squall
what are a score or two of missionaries to
such a people a pinch of snuff to the kraken i am
for sending ten thousand missionaries in a body and
converting the chinese en masse within six months of
the debarkation the thing is then done and turn to
something else

i fear you are too enthusiastic

a philanthropist is necessarily an enthusiast for
without enthusiasm what was ever achieved but commonplace
but again consider the poor in london
to that mob of misery what is a joint here and a loaf
there i am for voting to them twenty thousand




bullocks and one hundred thousand barrels of flour to begin
with they are then comforted and no more hunger
for one while among the poor of london and so all
round

sharing the character of your general project these
things i take it are rather examples of wonders that
were to be wished than wonders that will happen

and is the age of wonders passed is the world
too old is it barren think of sarah

then i am abraham reviling the angel with a
smile but still as to your design at large there
seems a certain audacity

but if to the audacity of the design there be brought
a commensurate circumspectness of execution how
then

why do you really believe that your world's
charity will ever go into operation

i have confidence that it will

but may you not be over-confident

for a christian to talk so

but think of the obstacles

obstacles i have confidence to remove obstacles
though mountains yes confidence in the world's
charity to that degree that as no better person offers to
supply the place i have nominated myself provisional
treasurer and will be happy to receive subscriptions for
the present to be devoted to striking off a million more
of my prospectuses

the talk went on the man in gray revealed a spirit
of benevolence which mindful of the millennial promise




had gone abroad over all the countries of the globe
much as the diligent spirit of the husbandman stirred
by forethought of the coming seed-time leads him in
march reveries at his fireside over every field of his
farm the master chord of the man in gray had been
touched and it seemed as if it would never cease
vibrating a not unsilvery tongue too was his with
gestures that were a pentecost of added ones and persuasiveness
before which granite hearts might crumble
into gravel

strange therefore how his auditor so singularly
good-hearted as he seemed remained proof to such eloquence
though not as it turned out to such pleadings
for after listening a while longer with pleasant
incredulity presently as the boat touched his place of
destination the gentleman with a look half humor half
pity put another bank-note into his hands charitable
to the last if only to the dreams of enthusiasm






a charitable lady


if a drunkard in a sober fit is the dullest of mortals
an enthusiast in a reason-fit is not the most lively
and this without prejudice to his greatly improved
understanding for if his elation was the height of his
madness his despondency is but the extreme of his sanity
something thus now to all appearance with the
man in gray society his stimulus loneliness was his
lethargy loneliness like the sea-breeze blowing off
from a thousand leagues of blankness he did not find
as veteran solitaires do if anything too bracing in
short left to himself with none to charm forth his
latent lymphatic he insensibly resumes his original air
a quiescent one blended of sad humility and demureness

ere long he goes laggingly into the ladies saloon as
in spiritless quest of somebody but after some disappointed
glances about him seats himself upon a sofa
with an air of melancholy exhaustion and depression

at the sofa's further end sits a plump and pleasant
person whose aspect seems to hint that if she have any
weak point it must be anything rather than her




excellent heart from her twilight dress neither dawn nor
dark apparently she is a widow just breaking the chrysalis
of her mourning a small gilt testament is in her
hand which she has just been reading half-relinquished
she holds the book in reverie her finger inserted at
the xiii of st corinthians to which chapter possibly
her attention might have recently been turned by witnessing
the scene of the monitory mute and his slate

the sacred page no longer meets her eye but as at
evening when for a time the western hills shine on
though the sun be set her thoughtful face retains its
tenderness though the teacher is forgotten

meantime the expression of the stranger is such as
ere long to attract her glance but no responsive one
presently in her somewhat inquisitive survey her
volume drops it is restored no encroaching politeness
in the act but kindness unadorned the eyes of
the lady sparkle evidently she is not now unprepossessed
soon bending over in a low sad tone full of
deference the stranger breathes madam pardon my
freedom but there is something in that face which
strangely draws me may i ask are you a sister of the
church

why   really   you   

in concern for her embarrassment he hastens to relieve
it but without seeming so to do it is very
solitary for a brother here eyeing the showy ladies
brocaded in the background i find none to mingle
souls with it may be wrong   i know it is   but i cannot
force myself to be easy with the people of the world




i prefer the company however silent of a brother or
sister in good standing by the way madam may i ask
if you have confidence

really sir   why sir   really   i   

could you put confidence in me for instance

really sir   as much   i mean as one may wisely
put in a   a   stranger an entire stranger i had almost
said rejoined the lady hardly yet at ease in her affability
drawing aside a little in body while at the same
time her heart might have been drawn as far the other
way a natural struggle between charity and prudence

entire stranger with a sigh ah who would
be a stranger in vain i wander no one will have
confidence in me

you interest me said the good lady in mild surprise
can i any way befriend you

no one can befriend me who has not confidence

but i   i have   at least to that degree   i mean
that   

nay nay you have none   none at all pardon i
see it no confidence fool fond fool that i am to
seek it

you are unjust sir rejoins the good lady with
heightened interest but it may be that something
untoward in your experiences has unduly biased you
not that i would cast reflections believe me i   yes
yes   i may say   that   that   

that you have confidence prove it let me have
twenty dollars




twenty dollars

there i told you madam you had no confidence

the lady was in an extraordinary way touched she
sat in a sort of restless torment knowing not which way
to turn she began twenty different sentences and left
off at the first syllable of each at last in desperation
she hurried out tell me sir for what you want the
twenty dollars

and did i not   then glancing at her half-mourning
for the widow and the fatherless i am traveling
agent of the widow and orphan asylum recently
founded among the seminoles

and why did you not tell me your object before
as not a little relieved poor souls   indians too   
those cruelly-used indians here here how could i
hesitate i am so sorry it is no more

grieve not for that madam rising and folding up
the bank-notes this is an inconsiderable sum i admit
but taking out his pencil and book though i
here but register the amount there is another register
where is set down the motive good-bye you have
confidence yea you can say to me as the apostle said
to the corinthians i rejoice that i have confidence in
you in all things






two business men transact a little business


   pray sir have you seen a gentleman with a weed
hereabouts rather a saddish gentleman strange where
he can have gone to i was talking with him not
twenty minutes since

by a brisk ruddy-cheeked man in a tasseled traveling-cap
carrying under his arm a ledger-like volume
the above words were addressed to the collegian before
introduced suddenly accosted by the rail to which not
long after his retreat as in a previous chapter recounted
he had returned and there remained

have you seen him sir

rallied from his apparent diffidence by the genial
jauntiness of the stranger the youth answered with unwonted
promptitude yes a person with a weed was
here not very long ago

saddish

yes and a little cracked too i should say

it was he misfortune i fear has disturbed his
brain now quick which way did he go

why just in the direction from which you came
the gangway yonder

did he then the man in the gray coat whom i




just met said right he must have gone ashore how
unlucky

he stood vexedly twitching at his cap-tassel which
fell over by his whisker and continued well i am very
sorry in fact i had something for him here   then
drawing nearer you see he applied to me for relief
no i do him injustice not that but he began to intimate
you understand well being very busy just then i
declined quite rudely too in a cold morose unfeeling
way i fear at all events not three minutes afterwards
i felt self-reproach with a kind of prompting very peremptory
to deliver over into that unfortunate man's
hands a ten-dollar bill you smile yes it may be
superstition but i can't help it i have my weak side
thank god then again he rapidly went on we
have been so very prosperous lately in our affairs   by
we i mean the black rapids coal company   that really
out of my abundance associative and individual it is
but fair that a charitable investment or two should be
made don't you think so

sir said the collegian without the least embarrassment
do i understand that you are officially connected
with the black rapids coal company

yes i happen to be president and transfer-agent

you are

yes but what is it to you you don't want to
invest

why do you sell the stock

some might be bought perhaps but why do you
ask you don't want to invest




but supposing i did with cool self-collectedness
could you do up the thing for me and here

bless my soul gazing at him in amaze really
you are quite a business man positively i feel afraid
of you

oh no need of that   you could sell me some of
that stock then

i don't know i don't know to be sure there are
a few shares under peculiar circumstances bought in by
the company but it would hardly be the thing to
convert this boat into the company's office i think
you had better defer investing so with an indifferent
air you have seen the unfortunate man i spoke of

let the unfortunate man go his ways   what is
that large book you have with you

my transfer-book i am subpoenaed with it to court

black rapids coal company obliquely reading
the gilt inscription on the back i have heard much of
it pray do you happen to have with you any statement
of the condition of your company

a statement has lately been printed

pardon me but i am naturally inquisitive have
you a copy with you

i tell you again i do not think that it would be
suitable to convert this boat into the company's office   
that unfortunate man did you relieve him at all

let the unfortunate man relieve himself   hand
me the statement

well you are such a business-man i can hardly
deny you here handing a small printed pamphlet




the youth turned it over sagely

i hate a suspicious man said the other observing
him but i must say i like to see a cautious one

i can gratify you there languidly returning the
pamphlet for as i said before i am naturally inquisitive
i am also circumspect no appearances can deceive
me your statement he added tells a very fine
story but pray was not your stock a little heavy
a while ago downward tendency sort of low spirits
among holders on the subject of that stock

yes there was a depression but how came it
who devised it the bears sir the depression of
our stock was solely owing to the growling the hypocritical
growling of the bears

how hypocritical

why the most monstrous of all hypocrites are these
bears hypocrites by inversion hypocrites in the simulation
of things dark instead of bright souls that thrive
less upon depression than the fiction of depression
professors of the wicked art of manufacturing depressions
spurious jeremiahs sham heraclituses who the
lugubrious day done return like sham lazaruses among
the beggars to make merry over the gains got by their
pretended sore heads   scoundrelly bears

you are warm against these bears

if i am it is less from the remembrance of their
stratagems as to our stock than from the persuasion
that these same destroyers of confidence and gloomy
philosophers of the stock-market though false in themselves
are yet true types of most destroyers of




confidence and gloomy philosophers the world over fellows
who whether in stocks politics bread-stuffs
morals metaphysics religion   be it what it may   
trump up their black panics in the naturally-quiet
brightness solely with a view to some sort of covert
advantage that corpse of calamity which the gloomy
philosopher parades is but his good-enough-morgan

i rather like that knowingly drawled the youth
i fancy these gloomy souls as little as the next one
sitting on my sofa after a champagne dinner smoking
my plantation cigar if a gloomy fellow come to me   
what a bore

you tell him it's all stuff don't you

i tell him it ain't natural i say to him you are
happy enough and you know it and everybody else is
as happy as you and you know that too and we shall
all be happy after we are no more and you know that
too but no still you must have your sulk

and do you know whence this sort of fellow gets
his sulk not from life for he's often too much of a
recluse or else too young to have seen anything of it
no he gets it from some of those old plays he sees on
the stage or some of those old books he finds up in
garrets ten to one he has lugged home from auction
a musty old seneca and sets about stuffing himself with
that stale old hay and thereupon thinks it looks wise
and antique to be a croaker thinks it's taking a standway
above his kind

just so assented the youth i've lived some and




seen a good many such ravens at second hand by the
way strange how that man with the weed you were inquiring
for seemed to take me for some soft sentimentalist
only because i kept quiet and thought because
i had a copy of tacitus with me that i was reading him
for his gloom instead of his gossip but i let him talk
and indeed by my manner humored him

you shouldn't have done that now unfortunate
man you must have made quite a fool of him

his own fault if i did but i like prosperous
fellows comfortable fellows fellows that talk comfortably
and prosperously like you such fellows are
generally honest and i say now i happen to have a
superfluity in my pocket and i'll just   

   act the part of a brother to that unfortunate
man

let the unfortunate man be his own brother
what are you dragging him in for all the time one
would think you didn't care to register any transfers
or dispose of any stock   mind running on something
else i say i will invest

stay stay here come some uproarious fellows   this
way this way

and with off-handed politeness the man with the
book escorted his companion into a private little haven
removed from the brawling swells without

business transacted the two came forth and walked
the deck

now tell me sir said he with the book how
comes it that a young gentleman like you a sedate




student at the first appearance should dabble in stocks and
that sort of thing

there are certain sophomorean errors in the world
drawled the sophomore deliberately adjusting his shirt-collar
not the least of which is the popular notion
touching the nature of the modern scholar and the nature
of the modern scholastic sedateness

so it seems so it seems really this is quite a
new leaf in my experience

experience sir originally observed the sophomore
is the only teacher

hence am i your pupil for it's only when experience
speaks that i can endure to listen to speculation

my speculations sir dryly drawing himself up
have been chiefly governed by the maxim of lord
bacon i speculate in those philosophies which come
home to my business and bosom   pray do you know of
any other good stocks

you wouldn't like to be concerned in the new jerusalem
would you

new jerusalem

yes the new and thriving city so called in northern
minnesota it was originally founded by certain fugitive
mormons hence the name it stands on the
mississippi here here is the map producing a roll
there   there you see are the public buildings   here
the landing   there the park   yonder the botanic gardens   
and this this little dot here is a perpetual fountain
you understand you observe there are twenty




asterisks those are for the lyceums they have lignum-vit
 rostrums

and are all these buildings now standing

all standing   bona fide

these marginal squares here are they the water-lots

water-lots in the city of new jerusalem all terra
firma   you don't seem to care about investing though

hardly think i should read my title clear as the
law students say yawned the collegian

prudent   you are prudent don't know that you are
wholly out either at any rate i would rather have
one of your shares of coal stock than two of this other
still considering that the first settlement was by two
fugitives who had swum over naked from the opposite
shore   it's a surprising place it is bona fide   but
dear me i must go oh if by possibility you should
come across that unfortunate man   

   in that case with drawling impatience i
will send for the steward and have him and his misfortunes
consigned overboard

ha ha   now were some gloomy philosopher here
some theological bear forever taking occasion to growl
down the stock of human nature with ulterior views
d'ye see to a fat benefice in the the gift of the worshipers
of ariamius he would pronounce that the sign of a
hardening heart and a softening brain yes that would
be his sinister construction but it's nothing more than
the oddity of a genial humor   genial but dry confess
it good-bye






in the cabin


stools settees sofas divans ottomans occupying
them are clusters of men old and young wise and simple
in their hands are cards spotted with diamonds
spades clubs hearts the favorite games are whist
cribbage and brag lounging in arm-chairs or sauntering
among the marble-topped tables amused with
the scene are the comparatively few who instead of
having hands in the games for the most part keep their
hands in their pockets these may be the philosophes
but here and there with a curious expression
one is reading a small sort of handbill of anonymous
poetry rather wordily entitled   

ode
on the intimations
of
distrust in man
unwillingly inferred from repeated repulses
in disinterested endeavors
to procure his
confidence

on the floor are many copies looking as if fluttered
down from a balloon the way they came there was
this a somewhat elderly person in the quaker dress




had quietly passed through the cabin and much in the
manner of those railway book-peddlers who precede
their proffers of sale by a distribution of puffs direct or
indirect of the volumes to follow had without speaking
handed about the odes which for the most part
after a cursory glance had been disrespectfully tossed
aside as no doubt the moonstruck production of some
wandering rhapsodist

in due time book under arm in trips the ruddy man
with the traveling-cap who lightly moving to and fro
looks animatedly about him with a yearning sort of
gratulatory affinity and longing expressive of the very
soul of sociality as much as to say oh boys would
that i were personally acquainted with each mother's
son of you since what a sweet world to make sweet
acquaintance in is ours my brothers yea and what
dear happy dogs are we all

and just as if he had really warbled it forth he makes
fraternally up to one lounging stranger or another exchanging
with him some pleasant remark

pray what have you there he asked of one newly
accosted a little dried-up man who looked as if he
never dined

a little ode rather queer too was the reply of
the same sort you see strewn on the floor here

i did not observe them let me see picking
one up and looking it over well now this is pretty
plaintive especially the opening   


alas for man he hath small sense
of genial trust and confidence





   if it be so alas for him indeed runs off very
smoothly sir beautiful pathos but do you think the
sentiment just

as to that said the little dried-up man i think
it a kind of queer thing altogether and yet i am almost
ashamed to add it really has set me to thinking
yes and to feeling just now somehow i feel as it
were trustful and genial i don't know that ever i felt
so much so before i am naturally numb in my sensibilities
but this ode in its way works on my numbness
not unlike a sermon which by lamenting over my
lying dead in trespasses and sins thereby stirs me up to
be all alive in well-doing

glad to hear it and hope you will do well as
the doctors say but who snowed the odes about
here

i cannot say i have not been here long

wasn't an angel was it come you say you feel
genial let us do as the rest and have cards

thank you i never play cards

a bottle of wine

thank you i never drink wine

cigars

thank you i never smoke cigars

tell stories

to speak truly i hardly think i know one worth
telling

seems to me then this geniality you say you feel
waked in you is as water-power in a land without
mills come you had better take a genial hand at the




cards to begin we will play for as small a sum as
you please just enough to make it interesting

indeed you must excuse me somehow i distrust
cards

what distrust cards genial cards then for
once i join with our sad philomel here   


alas for man he hath small sense
of genial trust and confidence

good-bye

sauntering and chatting here and there again he
with the book at length seems fatigued looks round
for a seat and spying a partly-vacant settee drawn up
against the side drops down there soon like his
chance neighbor who happens to be the good merchant
becoming not a little interested in the scene more immediately
before him a party at whist two creamfaced
giddy unpolished youths the one in a red cravat
the other in a green opposed to two bland grave
handsome self-possessed men of middle age decorously
dressed in a sort of professional black and apparently
doctors of some eminence in the civil law

by-and-by after a preliminary scanning of the new
comer next him the good merchant sideways leaning
over whispers behind a crumpled copy of the ode
which he holds sir i don't like the looks of those
two do you

hardly was the whispered reply those colored
cravats are not in the best taste at least not to mine
but my taste is no rule for all

you mistake i mean the other two and i don't




refer to dress but countenance i confess i am not
familiar with such gentry any further than reading about
them in the papers   but those two are   are sharpers
aint they

far be from us the captious and fault-finding spirit
my dear sir

indeed sir i would not find fault i am little given
that way but certainly to say the least these two
youths can hardly be adepts while the opposed couple
may be even more

you would not hint that the colored cravats would
be so bungling as to lose and the dark cravats so dextrous
as to cheat   sour imaginations my dear sir
dismiss them to little purpose have you read the
ode you have there years and experience i trust
have not sophisticated you a fresh and liberal construction
would teach us to regard those four players   
indeed this whole cabin-full of players   as playing at
games in which every player plays fair and not a player
but shall win

now you hardly mean that because games in
which all may win such games remain as yet in this
world uninvented i think

come come luxuriously laying himself back and
casting a free glance upon the players fares all paid
digestion sound care toil penury grief unknown
lounging on this sofa with waistband relaxed why not
be cheerfully resigned to one's fate nor peevishly pick
holes in the blessed fate of the world

upon this the good merchant after staring long and




hard and then rubbing his forehead fell into meditation
at first uneasy but at last composed and in the
end once more addressed his companion well i see
it's good to out with one's private thoughts now and
then somehow i don't know why a certain misty
suspiciousness seems inseparable from most of one's private
notions about some men and some things but
once out with these misty notions and their mere contact
with other men's soon dissipates or at least modifies
them

you think i have done you good then may be
i have but don't thank me don't thank me if by
words casually delivered in the social hour i do any
good to right or left it is but involuntary influence   
locust-tree sweetening the herbage under it no merit
at all mere wholesome accident of a wholesome nature   
don't you see

another stare from the good merchant and both were
silent again

finding his book hitherto resting on his lap rather
irksome there the owner now places it edgewise on the
settee between himself and neighbor in so doing
chancing to expose the lettering on the back   black
rapias coal company   which the good merchant
scrupulously honorable had much ado to avoid reading
so directly would it have fallen under his eye had
he not conscientiously averted it on a sudden as if
just reminded of something the stranger starts up and
moves away in his haste leaving his book which
the merchant observing without delay takes it up and




hurrying after civilly returns it in which act he could
not avoid catching sight by an involuntary glance of
part of the lettering

thank you thank you my good sir said the other
receiving the volume and was resuming his retreat
when the merchant spoke excuse me but are you
not in some way connected with the   the coal company
i have heard of

there is more than one coal company that may be
heard of my good sir smiled the other pausing with
an expression of painful impatience disinterestedly
mastered

but you are connected with one in particular   
the black rapids are you not

how did you find that out

well sir i have heard rather tempting information
of your company

who is your informant pray somewhat coldly

a   a person by the name of ringman

don't know him but doubtless there are plenty
who know our company whom our company does not
know in the same way that one may know an individual
yet be unknown to him   known this ringman
long old friend i suppose   but pardon i must
leave you

stay sir that   that stock

stock

yes it's a little irregular perhaps but   

dear me you don't think of doing any business
with me do you in my official capacity i have not




been authenticated to you this transfer-book now
holding it up so as to bring the lettering in sight how
do you know that it may not be a bogus one and i
being personally a stranger to you how can you have
confidence in me

because knowingly smiled thee good merchant
if you were other than i have confidence that you are
hardly would you challenge distrust that way

but you have not examined my book

what need to if already i believe that it is what it
is lettered to be

but you had better it might suggest doubts

doubts may be it might suggest but not knowledge
for how by examining the book should i think i
knew any more than i now think i do since if it
be the true book i think it so already and since if it
be otherwise then i have never seen the true one and
don't know what that ought to look like

your logic i will not criticize but your confidence i
admire and earnestly too jocose as was the method
i took to draw it out enough we will go to yonder
table and if there be any business which either in my
private or official capacity i can help you do pray
command me






only a page or so


the transaction concluded the two still remained
seated falling into familiar conversation by degrees
verging into that confidential sort of sympathetic
silence the last refinement and luxury of unaffected
good feeling a kind of social superstition to suppose
that to be truly friendly one must be saying friendly
words all the time any more than be doing friendly
deeds continually true friendliness like true religion
being in a sort independent of works

at length the good merchant whose eyes were pensively
resting upon the gay tables in the distance broke
the spell by saying that from the spectacle before them
one would little divine what other quarters of the boat
might reveal he cited the case accidentally encountered
but an hour or two previous of a shrunken old
miser clad in shrunken old moleskin stretched out an
invalid on a bare plank in the emigrants quarters
eagerly clinging to life and lucre though the one was
gasping for outlet and about the other he was in torment
lest death or some other unprincipled cut-purse
should be the means of his losing it by like feeble




tenure holding lungs and pouch and yet knowing and
desiring nothing beyond them for his mind never
raised above mould was now all but mouldered away
to such a degree indeed that he had no trust in anything
not even in his parchment bonds which the better
to preserve from the tooth of time he had packed
down and sealed up like brandy peaches in a tin case
of spirits

the worthy man proceeded at some length with
these dispiriting particulars nor would his cheery
companion wholly deny that there might be a point of
view from which such a case of extreme want of confidence
might to the humane mind present features not
altogether welcome as wine and olives after dinner
still he was not without compensatory considerations
and upon the whole took his companion to task for
evincing what in a good-natured round-about way he
hinted to be a somewhat jaundiced sentimentality
nature he added in shakespeare's words had meal and
bran and rightly regarded the bran in its way was
not to be condemned

the other was not disposed to question the justice of
shakespeare's thought but would hardly admit the
propriety of the application in this instance much less
of the comment so after some further temperate discussion
of the pitiable miser finding that they could
not entirely harmonize the merchant cited another case
that of the negro cripple but his companion suggested
whether the alleged hardships of that alleged
unfortunate might not exist more in the pity of the




observer than the experience of the observed he knew
nothing about the cripple nor had seen him but ventured
to surmise that could one but get at the real state
of his heart he would be found about as happy as most
men if not in fact full as happy as the speaker himself
he added that negroes were by nature a singularly
cheerful race no one ever heard of a native-born african
zimmermann or torquemada that even from religion
they dismissed all gloom in their hilarious rituals they
danced so to speak and as it were cut pigeon-wings
it was improbable therefore that a negro however reduced
to his stumps by fortune could be ever thrown
off the legs of a laughing philosophy

foiled again the good merchant would not desist but
ventured still a third case that of the man with the
weed whose story as narrated by himself and confirmed
and filled out by the testimony of a certain man in a
gray coat whom the merchant had afterwards met he
now proceeded to give and that without holding
back those particulars disclosed by the second informant
but which delicacy had prevented the unfortunate
man himself from touching upon

but as the good merchant could perhaps do better
justice to the man than the story we shall venture to
tell it in other words than his though not to any other
effect






story of the unfortunate man from which may be gathered
whether or no he has been justly so entitled


it appeared that the unfortunate man had had for a
wife one of those natures anomalously vicious which
would almost tempt a metaphysical lover of our species
to doubt whether the human form be in all cases conclusive
evidence of humanity whether sometimes it may
not be a kind of unpledged and indifferent tabernacle
and whether once for all to crush the saying of thrasea
an unaccountable one considering that he himself was
so good a man that he who hates vice hates humanity
it should not in self-defense be held for a reasonable
maxim that none but the good are human

goneril was young in person lithe and straight too
straight indeed for a woman a complexion naturally
rosy and which would have been charmingly so but for
a certain hardness and bakedness like that of the glazed
colors on stone-ware her hair was of a deep rich
chestnut but worn in close short curls all round her
head her indian figure was not without its impairing
effect on her bust while her mouth would have been
pretty but for a trace of moustache upon the whole




aided by the resources of the toilet her appearance at
distance was such that some might have thought her if
anything rather beautiful though of a style of beauty
rather peculiar and cactus-like

it was happy for goneril that her more striking peculiarities
were less of the person than of temper and taste
one hardly knows how to reveal that while having a
natural antipathy to such things as the breast of chicken
or custard or peach or grape goneril could yet in
private make a satisfactory lunch on hard crackers and
brawn of ham she liked lemons and the only kind of
candy she loved were little dried sticks of blue clay
secretly carried in her pocket withal she had hard
steady health like a squaw's with as firm a spirit and
resolution some other points about her were likewise
such as pertain to the women of savage life lithe
though she was she loved supineness but upon occasion
could endure like a stoic she was taciturn too from
early morning till about three o'clock in the afternoon
she would seldom speak   it taking that time to thaw
her by all accounts into but talking terms with humanity
during the interval she did little but look and
keep looking out of her large metallic eyes which her
enemies called cold as a cuttle-fish's but which by her
were esteemed gazelle-like for goneril was not without
vanity those who thought they best knew her often
wondered what happiness such a being could take in
life not considering the happiness which is to be had by
some natures in the very easy way of simply causing
pain to those around them those who suffered from




goneril's strange nature might with one of those
hyberboles to which the resentful incline have pronounced
her some kind of toad but her worst slanderers
could never with any show of justice have accused
her of being a toady in a large sense she possessed
the virtue of independence of mind goneril held it
flattery to hint praise even of the absent and even if
merited but honesty to fling people's imputed faults
into their faces this was thought malice but it certainly
was not passion passion is human like an
icicle-dagger goneril at once stabbed and froze so at
least they said and when she saw frankness and innocence
tyrannized into sad nervousness under her spell
according to the same authority inly she chewed her
blue clay and you could mark that she chuckled these
peculiarities were strange and unpleasing but another
was alleged one really incomprehensible in company
she had a strange way of touching as by accident the
arm or hand of comely young men and seemed to reap
a secret delight from it but whether from the humane
satisfaction of having given the evil-touch as it is called
or whether it was something else in her not equally
wonderful but quite as deplorable remained an enigma

needless to say what distress was the unfortunate man's
when engaged in conversation with company he would
suddenly perceive his goneril bestowing her mysterious
touches especially in such cases where the strangeness
of the thing seemed to strike upon the touched person
notwithstanding good-breeding forbade his proposing
the mystery on the spot as a subject of discussion for




the company in these cases too the unfortunate man
could never endure so much as to look upon the touched
young gentleman afterwards fearful of the mortification
of meeting in his countenance some kind of more or less
quizzingly-knowing expression he would shudderingly
shun the young gentleman so that here to the husband
goneril's touch had the dread operation of the
heathen taboo now goneril brooked no chiding so
at favorable times he in a wary manner and not indelicately
would venture in private interviews gently to
make distant allusions to this questionable propensity
she divined him but in her cold loveless way said it
was witless to be telling one's dreams especially foolish
ones but if the unfortunate man liked connubially to
rejoice his soul with such chimeras much connubial joy
might they give him all this was sad   a touching
case   but all might perhaps have been borne by the
unfortunate man   conscientiously mindful of his vow   
for better or for worse   to love and cherish his dear
goneril so long as kind heaven might spare her to him   
but when after all that had happened the devil of
jealousy entered her a calm clayey cakey devil for
none other could possess her and the object of that deranged
jealousy her own child a little girl of seven her
father's consolation and pet when he saw goneril artfully
torment the little innocent and then play the
maternal hypocrite with it the unfortunate man's patient
long-suffering gave way knowing that she would
neither confess nor amend and might possibly become
even worse than she was he thought it but duty as a




father to withdraw the child from her but loving it as
he did he could not do so without accompanying it into
domestic exile himself which hard though it was he
did whereupon the whole female neighborhood who
till now had little enough admired dame goneril broke
out in indignation against a husband who without assigning
a cause could deliberately abandon the wife of
his bosom and sharpen the sting to her too by depriving
her of the solace of retaining her offspring to all this
self-respect with christian charity towards goneril long
kept the unfortunate man dumb and well had it been
had he continued so for when driven to desperation
he hinted something of the truth of the case not a soul
would credit it while for goneril she pronounced all
he said to be a malicious invention ere long at the
suggestion of some woman's-rights women the injured
wife began a suit and thanks to able counsel and accommodating
testimony succeeded in such a way as
not only to recover custody of the child but to get such
a settlement awarded upon a separation as to make
penniless the unfortunate man so he averred besides
through the legal sympathy she enlisted effecting a
judicial blasting of his private reputation what made
it yet more lamentable was that the unfortunate man
thinking that before the court his wisest plan as well
as the most christian besides being as he deemed not
at variance with the truth of the matter would be to
put forth the plea of the mental derangement of goneril
which done he could with less of mortification to himself
and odium to her reveal in self-defense those




eccentricities which had led to his retirement from the
joys of wedlock had much ado in the end to prevent this
charge of derangement from fatally recoiling upon himself   
especially when among other things he alleged
her mysterious touchings in vain did his counsel
striving to make out the derangement to be where in
fact if anywhere it was urge that to hold otherwise
to hold that such a being as goneril was sane this was
constructively a libel upon womankind libel be it
and all ended by the unfortunate man's subsequently
getting wind of goneril's intention to procure him to
be permanently committed for a lunatic upon which
he fled and was now an innocent outcast wandering
forlorn in the great valley of the mississippi with a
weed on his hat for the loss of his goneril for he had
lately seen by the papers that she was dead and thought
it but proper to comply with the prescribed form of
mourning in such cases for some days past he had
been trying to get money enough to return to his child
and was but now started with inadequate funds

now all of this from the beginning the good merchant
could not but consider rather hard for the unfortunate
man






the man with the traveling-cap evinces much humanity
and in a way which would seem to show him to be one
of the most logical of optimists


years ago a grave american savan being in london
observed at an evening party there a certain coxcombical
fellow as he thought an absurd ribbon in his lapel
and full of smart persiflage whisking about to the admiration
of as many as were disposed to admire great
was the savan's disdain but chancing ere long to find
himself in a corner with the jackanapes got into conversation
with him when he was somewhat ill-prepared
for the good sense of the jackanapes but was altogether
thrown aback upon subsequently being whispered by a
friend that the jackanapes was almost as great a savan
as himself being no less a personage than sir humphrey
davy

the above anecdote is given just here by way of an
anticipative reminder to such readers as from the kind
of jaunty levity or what may have passed for such
hitherto for the most part appearing in the man with the
traveling-cap may have been tempted into a more or
less hasty estimate of him that such readers when




they find the same person as they presently will capable
of philosophic and humanitarian discourse   no mere
casual sentence or two as heretofore at times but solidly
sustained throughout an almost entire sitting that they
may not like the american savan be thereupon betrayed
into any surprise incompatible with their own good
opinion of their previous penetration

the merchant's narration being ended the other
would not deny but that it did in some degree affect
him he hoped he was not without proper feeling for
the unfortunate man but he begged to know in what
spirit he bore his alleged calamities did he despond
or have confidence

the merchant did not perhaps take the exact import
of the last member of the question but answered that
if whether the unfortuante man was becomingly resigned
under his affliction or no was the point he could say for
him that resigned he was and to an exemplary degree
for not only so far as known did he refrain from any
one-sided reflections upon human goodness and human
justice but there was observable in him an air of
chastened reliance and at times tempered cheerfulness

upon which the other observed that since the unfortunate
man's alleged experience could not be deemed
very conciliatory towards a view of human nature better
than human nature was it largely redounded to his
fair-mindedness as well as piety that under the alleged
dissuasives apparently so from philanthropy he had
not in a moment of excitement been warped over to
the ranks of the misanthropes he doubted not also




that with such a man his experience would in the end
act by a complete and beneficent inversion and so far
from shaking his confidence in his kind confirm it and
rivet it which would the more surely be the case did
he the unfortunate man at last become satisfied as
sooner or later he probably would be that in the distraction
of his mind his goneril had not in all respects
had fair play at all events the description of the
lady charity could not but regard as more or less exaggerated
and so far unjust the truth probably was
that she was a wife with some blemishes mixed with
some beauties but when the blemishes were displayed
her husband no adept in the female nature had tried to
use reason with her instead of something far more persuasive
hence his failure to convince and convert
the act of withdrawing from her seemed under the
circumstances abrupt in brief there were probably
small faults on both sides more than balanced by large
virtues and one should not be hasty in judging

when the merchant strange to say opposed views so
calm and impartial and again with some warmth deplored
the case of the unfortunate man his companion
not without seriousness checked him saying that this
would never do that though but in the most exceptional
case to admit the existence of unmerited misery more
particularly if alleged to have been brought about by
unhindered arts of the wicked such an admission was
to say the least not prudent since with some it might
unfavorably bias their most important persuasions not
that those persuasions were legitimately servile to such




influences because since the common occurrences of
life could never in the nature of things steadily look one
way and tell one story as flags in the trade-wind hence
if the conviction of a providence for instance were in
any way made dependent upon such variabilities as
everyday events the degree of that conviction would
in thinking minds be subject to fluctuations akin to those
of the stock-exchange during a long and uncertain war
here he glanced aside at his transfer-book and after a
moment's pause continued it was of the essence of a
right conviction of the divine nature as with a right
conviction of the human that based less on experience
than intuition it rose above the zones of weather

when now the merchant with all his heart coincided
with this as being a sensible as well as religious person
he could not but do his companion expressed satisfaction
that in an age of some distrust on such subjects
he could yet meet with one who shared with him
almost to the full so sound and sublime a confidence

still he was far from the illiberality of denying that
philosophy duly bounded was not permissible only
he deemed it at least desirable that when such a case as
that alleged of the unfortunate man was made the subject
of philosophic discussion it should be so philosophized
upon as not to afford handles to those unblessed
with the true light for but to grant that there was
so much as a mystery about such a case might by those
persons be held for a tacit surrender of the question
and as for the apparent license temporarily permitted
sometimes to the bad over the good as was by




implication alleged with regard to goneril and the unfortnnate
man it might be injudicious there to lay too much
polemic stress upon the doctrine of future retribution as
the vindication of present impunity for though indeed
to the right-minded that doctrine was true and of sufficient
solace yet with the perverse the polemic mention
of it might but provoke the shallow though mischievous
conceit that such a doctrine was but tantamount to the
one which should affirm that providence was not now
but was going to be in short with all sorts of cavilers
it was best both for them and everybody that whoever
had the true light should stick behind the secure
malakoff of confidence nor be tempted forth to hazardous
skirmishes on the open ground of reason therefore
he deemed it unadvisable in the good man even in
the privacy of his own mind or in communion with a
congenial one to indulge in too much latitude of philosophizing
or indeed of compassionating since this might
beget an indiscreet habit of thinking and feeling which
might unexpectedly betray him upon unsuitable occasions
indeed whether in private or public there was
nothing which a good man was more bound to guard
himself against than on some topics the emotional unreserve
of his natural heart for that the natural heart
in certain points was not what it might be men had
been authoritatively admonished

but he thought he might be getting dry

the merchant in his good-nature thought otherwise
and said that he would be glad to refresh himself with
such fruit all day it was sitting under a ripe pulpit




and better such a seat than under a ripe peach-tree

the other was pleased to find that he had not as he
feared been prosing but would rather not be considered
in the formal light of a preacher he preferred
being still received in that of the equal and genial companion
to which end throwing still more of sociability
into his manner he again reverted to the unfortunate
man take the very worst view of that case
admit that his goneril was indeed a goneril how
fortunate to be at last rid of this goneril both by
nature and by law if he were acquainted with the
unfortunate man instead of condoling with him he
would congratulate him great good fortune had this
unfortunate man lucky dog he dared say after all

to which the merchant replied that he earnestly
hoped it might be so and at any rate he tried his best
to comfort himself with the persuasion that if the unfortunate
man was not happy in this world he would
at least be so in another

his companion made no question of the unfortunate
man's happiness in both worlds and presently calling
for some champagne invited the merchant to partake
upon the playful plea that whatever notions other than
felicitous ones he might associate with the unfortunate
man a little champagne would readily bubble away

at intervals they slowly quaffed several glasses in
silence and thoughtfulness at last the merchant's expressive
face flushed his eye moistly beamed his lips
trembled with an imaginative and feminine sensibility




without sending a single fume to his head the wine
seemed to shoot to his heart and begin soothsaying
there ah he cried pushing his glass from him
ah wine is good and confidence is good but can wine
or confidence percolate down through all the stony
strata of hard considerations and drop warmly and
ruddily into the cold cave of truth truth will not be
comforted led by dear charity lured by sweet hope
fond fancy essays this feat but in vain mere dreams
and ideals they explode in your hand leaving naught
but the scorching behind

why why why in amaze at the burst bless
me if in vino veritas be a true saying then for all the
fine confidence you professed with me just now distrust
deep distrust underlies it and ten thousand
strong like the irish rebellion breaks out in you now
that wine good wine should do it upon my soul
half seriously half humorously securing the bottle
you shall drink no more of it wine was meant to
gladden the heart not grieve it to heighten confidence
not depress it

sobered shamed all but confounded by this raillery
the most telling rebuke under such circumstances the
merchant stared about him and then with altered mien
stammeringly confessed that he was almost as much
surprised as his companion at what had escaped him
he did not understand it was quite at a loss to account
for such a rhapsody popping out of him unbidden it
could hardly be the champagne he felt his brain unaffected
in fact if anything the wine had acted upon




it something like white of egg in coffee clarifying and
brightening

brightening brightening it may be but less like
the white of egg in coffee than like stove-lustre on a
stove   black brightening seriously i repent calling for
the champagne to a temperament like yours champagne
is not to be recommended pray my dear sir do
you feel quite yourself again confidence restored

i hope so i think i may say it is so but we have
had a long talk and i think i must retire now

so saying the merchant rose and making his adieus
left the table with the air of one mortified at having
been tempted by his own honest goodness accidentally
stimulated into making mad disclosures   to himself as
to another   of the queer unaccountable caprices of his
natural heart






worth the consideration of those to whom it may prove
worth considering


as the last chapter was begun with a reminder looking
forwards so the present must consist of one glancing
backwards

to some it may raise a degree of surprise that one
so full of confidence as the merchant has throughout
shown himself up to the moment of his late sudden impulsiveness
should in that instance have betrayed such
a depth of discontent he may be thought inconsistent
and even so he is but for this is the author to be
blamed true it may be urged that there is nothing
a writer of fiction should more carefully see to as there
is nothing a sensible reader will more carefully look for
than that in the depiction of any character its consistency
should be preserved but this though at first blush
seeming reasonable enough may upon a closer view
prove not so much so for how does it couple with
another requirement   equally insisted upon perhaps   
that while to all fiction is allowed some play of invention
yet fiction based on fact should never be contradictory
to it and is it not a fact that in real life a consistent




character is a rara avis which being so the distaste
of readers to the contrary sort in books can hardly arise
from any sense of their untrueness it may rather be
from perplexity as to understanding them but if the
acutest sage be often at his wits ends to understand
living character shall those who are not sages expect to
run and read character in those mere phantoms which
flit along a page like shadows along a wall that
fiction where every character can by reason of its consistency
be comprehended at a glance either exhibits
but sections of character making them appear for
wholes or else is very untrue to reality while on the
other hand that author who draws a character even
though to common view incongruous in its parts as the
flying-squirrel and at different periods as much at
variance with itself as the butterfly is with the caterpillar
into which it changes may yet in so doing be
not false but faithful to facts

if reason be judge no writer has produced such inconsistent
characters as nature herself has it must call
for no small sagacity in a reader unerringly to discriminate
in a novel between the inconsistencies of conception
and those of life as elsewhere experience is the only
guide here but as no one man can be coextensive with
what is it may be unwise in every case to rest upon it
when the duck-billed beaver of australia was first
brought stuffed to england the naturalists appealing
to their classifications maintained that there was in
reality no such creature the bill in the specimen
must needs be in some way artificially stuck on




but let nature to the perplexity of the naturalists produce
her duck-billed beavers as she may lesser authors
some may hold have no business to be perplexing
readers with duck-billed characters always they
should represent human nature not in obscurity but
transparency which indeed is the practice with most
novelists and is perhaps in certain cases someway felt
to be a kind of honor rendered by them to their kind
but whether it involve honor or otherwise might be
mooted considering that if these waters of human
nature can be so readily seen through it may be either
that they are very pure or very shallow upon the
whole it might rather be thought that he who in view
of its inconsistencies says of human nature the same that
in view of its contrasts is said of the divine nature that
it is past finding out thereby evinces a better appreciation
of it than he who by always representing it in a
clear light leaves it to be inferred that he clearly knows
all about it

but though there is a prejudice against inconsistent
characters in books yet the prejudice bears the other
way when what seemed at first their inconsistency
afterwards by the skill of the writer turns out to be
their good keeping the great masters excel in nothing
so much as in this very particular they challenge
astonishment at the tangled web of some character
and then raise admiration still greater at their satisfactory
unraveling of it in this way throwing open
sometimes to the understanding even of school misses
the last complications of that spirit which is




affirmed by its creator to be fearfully and wonderfully
made

at least something like this is claimed for certain
psychological novelists nor will the claim be here
disputed yet as touching this point it may prove
suggestive that all those sallies of ingenuity having for
their end the revelation of human nature on fixed principles
have by the best judges been excluded with
contempt from the ranks of the sciences   palmistry
physiognomy phrenology psychology likewise the
fact that in all ages such conflicting views have by the
most eminent minds been taken of mankind would as
with other topics seem some presumption of a pretty
general and pretty thorough ignorance of it which
may appear the less improbable if it be considered that
after poring over the best novels professing to portray
human nature the studious youth will still run risk of
being too often at fault upon actually entering the world
whereas had he been furnished with a true delineation
it ought to fare with him something as with a stranger
entering map in hand boston town the streets may be
very crooked he may often pause but thanks to his true
map he does not hopelessly lose his way nor to this
comparison can it be an adequate objection that the
twistings of the town are always the same and those of
human nature subject to variation the grand points of
human nature are the same to-day they were a thousand
years ago the only variability in them is in expression
not in feature

but as in spite of seeming discouragement some




mathematicians are yet in hopes of hitting upon an exact
method of determining the longitude the more earnest
psychologists may in the face of previous failures still
cherish expectations with regard to some mode of infallibly
discovering the heart of man

but enough has been said by way of apology for
whatever may have seemed amiss or obscure in the
character of the merchant so nothing remains but to turn
to our comedy or rather to pass from the comedy of
thought to that of action






an old miser upon suitable representations is prevailed upon to
venture an investment


the merchant having withdrawn the other remained
seated alone for a time with the air of one who after
having conversed with some excellent man carefully
ponders what fell from him however intellectually inferior
it may be that none of the profit may be lost
happy if from any honest word he has heard he can
derive some hint which besides confirming him in the
theory of virtue may likewise serve for a finger-post
to virtuous action

ere long his eye brightened as if some such hint was
now caught he rises book in hand quits the cabin
and enters upon a sort of corridor narrow and dim a
by-way to a retreat less ornate and cheery than the
former in short the emigrants quarters but which
owing to the present trip being a down-river one will
doubtless be found comparatively tenantless owing
to obstructions against the side windows the whole
place is dim and dusky very much so for the most
part yet by starts haggardly lit here and there by
narrow capricious sky-lights in the cornices but there




would seem no special need for light the place being
designed more to pass the night in than the day
in brief a pine barrens dormitory of knotty pine bunks
without bedding as with the nests in the geometrical
towns of the associate penguin and pelican these bunks
were disposed with philadelphian regularity but like
the cradle of the oriole they were pendulous and
moreover were so to speak three-story cradles the
description of one of which will suffice for all

four ropes secured to the ceiling passed downwards
through auger-holes bored in the corners of three rough
planks which at equal distances rested on knots vertically
tied in the ropes the lowermost plank but an inch
or two from the floor the whole affair resembling on a
large scale rope book-shelves only instead of hanging
firmly against a wall they swayed to and fro at the
least suggestion of motion but were more especially
lively upon the provocation of a green emigrant sprawling
into one and trying to lay himself out there when
the cradling would be such as almost to toss him back
whence he came in consequence one less inexperienced
essaying repose on the uppermost shelf was liable
to serious disturbance should a raw beginner select
a shelf beneath sometimes a throng of poor emigrants
coming at night in a sudden rain to occupy these oriole
nests would   through ignorance of their peculiarity   
bring about such a rocking uproar of carpentry joining
to it such an uproar of exclamations that it seemed as if
some luckless ship with all its crew was being dashed
to pieces among the rocks they were beds devised




by some sardonic foe of poor travelers to deprive them
of that tranquillity which should precede as well as
accompany slumber   procrustean beds on whose hard
grain humble worth and honesty writhed still invoking
repose while but torment responded ah did any one
make such a bunk for himself instead of having it made
for him it might be just but how cruel to say you
must lie on it

but purgatory as the place would appear the
stranger advances into it and like orpheus in his gay
descent to tartarus lightly hums to himself an opera
snatch

suddenly there is a rustling then a creaking one of
the cradles swings out from a murky nook a sort of
wasted penguin-flipper is supplicatingly put forth
while a wail like that of dives is heard   water
water

it was the miser of whom the merchant had spoken

swift as a sister-of-charity the stranger hovers over
him   

my poor poor sir what can i do for you

ugh ugh   water

darting out he procures a glass returns and holding it
to the sufferer's lips supports his head while he drinks
and did they let you lie here my poor sir racked
with this parching thirst

the miser a lean old man whose flesh seemed salted
cod-fish dry as combustibles head like one whittled
by an idiot out of a knot flat bony mouth nipped
between buzzard nose and chin expression flitting




between hunks and imbecile   now one now the other   
he made no response his eyes were closed his cheek
lay upon an old white moleskin coat rolled under his
head like a wizened apple upon a grimy snow-bank

revived at last he inclined towards his ministrant
and in a voice disastrous with a cough said   i am
old and miserable a poor beggar not worth a shoe-string   
how can i repay you

by giving me your confidence

confidence he squeaked with changed manner
while the pallet swung little left at my age but take
the stale remains and welcome

such as it is though you give it very good
now give me a hundred dollars

upon this the miser was all panic his hands
groped towards his waist then suddenly flew upward
beneath his moleskin pillow and there lay clutching
something out of sight meantime to himself he incoherently
mumbled   confidence cant gammon
confidence hum bubble   confidence fetch gouge   
hundred dollars   hundred devils

half spent he lay mute awhile then feebly raising
himself in a voice for the moment made strong by the
sarcasm said a hundred dollars rather high price to
put upon confidence but don't you see i am a poor
old rat here dying in the wainscot you have served
me but wretch that i am i can but cough you my
thanks   ugh ugh ugh

this time his cough was so violent that its convulsions
were imparted to the plank which swung him




about like a stone in a sling preparatory to its being
hurled

ugh ugh ugh

what a shocking cough i wish my friend the
herb-doctor was here now abox of his omni-balsamic
reinvigorator would do you good

ugh ugh ugh

i've a good mind to go find him he's aboard
somewhere i saw his long snuff-colored surtout
trust me his medicines are the best in the
world

ugh ugh ugh

oh how sorry i am

no doubt of it squeaked the other again but go
get your charity out on deck there parade the pursy
peacocks they don't cough down here in desertion and
darkness like poor old me look how scaly a pauper i
am clove with this churchyard cough ugh ugh
ugh

again how sorry i feel not only for your cough
but your poverty such a rare chance made unavailable
did you have but the sum named how i could
invest it for you treble profits but confidence   
i fear that even had you the precious cash you
would not have the more precious confidence i speak
of

ugh ugh ugh flightily raising himself what's
that how how then you don't want the money
for yourself

my dear dear sir how could you impute to me




such preposterous self-seeking to solicit out of hand
for my private behoof an hundred dollars from a perfect
stranger i am not mad my dear sir

how how still more bewildered do you then
go about the world gratis seeking to invest people's
money for them

my humble profession sir i live not for myself
but the world will not have confidence in me and yet
confidence in me were great gain

but but in a kind of vertigo what do   do you
do   do with people's money ugh ugh how is the
gain made

to tell that would ruin me that known every
one would be going into the business and it would be
overdone a secret a mystery   all i have to do with
you is to receive your confidence and all you have to
do with me is in due time to receive it back thrice
paid in trebling profits

what what imbecility in the ascendant once
more but the vouchers the vouchers suddenly
hunkish again

honesty's best voucher is honesty's face

can't see yours though peering through the obscurity

from this last alternating flicker of rationality the
miser fell back sputtering into his previous gibberish
but it took now an arithmetical turn eyes closed he
lay muttering to himself   

one hundred one hundred   two hundred two hundred   
three hundred three hundred




he opened his eyes feebly stared and still more feebly
said   

it's a little dim here ain't it ugh ugh but
as well as my poor old eyes can see you look honest

i am glad to hear that

if   if now i should put   trying to raise himself
but vainly excitement having all but exhausted him   
if if now i should put put   

no ifs downright confidence or none so help
me heaven i will have no half-confidences

he said it with an indifferent and superior air and
seemed moving to go

don't don't leave me friend bear with me age
can't help some distrust it can't friend it can't ugh
ugh ugh oh i am so old and miserable i ought to
have a guard ee an tell me if   

if no more

stay how soon   ugh ugh   would my money be
trebled how soon friend

you won't confide good-bye

stay stay falling back now like an infant i
confide i confide help friend my distrust

from an old buckskin pouch tremulously dragged
forth ten hoarded eagles tarnished into the appearance
of ten old horn-buttons were taken and half-eagerly
half-reluctantly offered

i know not whether i should accept this slack confidence
said the other coldly receiving the gold but
an eleventh-hour confidence a sick-bed confidence a




distempered death-bed confidence after all give me
the healthy confidence of healthy men with their
healthy wits about them but let that pass all right
good-bye

nay back back   receipt my receipt ugh ugh
ugh who are you what have i done where go
you my gold my gold ugh ugh ugh

but unluckily for this final flicker of reason the
stranger was now beyond ear-shot nor was any one else
within hearing of so feeble a call






a sick man after some impatience is induced to become a patient


the sky slides into blue the bluffs into bloom the
rapid mississippi expands runs sparkling and gurgling
all over in eddies one magnified wake of a seventy-four
the sun comes out a golden huzzar from his tent flashing
his helm on the world all things warmed in the
landscape leap speeds the ddal boat as a dream

but withdrawn in a corner wrapped about in a shawl
sits an unparticipating man visited but not warmed by
the sun   a plant whose hour seems overwhile buds
are blowing and seeds are astir on a stool at his left
sits a stranger in a snuff-colored surtout the collar
thrown back his hand waving in persuasive gesture his
eye beaming with hope but not easily may hope be
awakened in one long tranced into hopelessness by a
chronic complaint

to some remark the sick man by word or look
seemed to have just made an impatiently querulous
answer when with a deprecatory air the other resumed

nay think not i seek to cry up my treatment by




crying down that of others and yet when one is confident
he has truth on his side and that it is not on the
other it is no very easy thing to be charitable not that
temper is the bar but conscience for charity would
beget toleration you know which is a kind of implied
permitting and in effect a kind of countenancing and
that which is countenanced is so far furthered but
should untruth be furthered still while for the
world's good i refuse to further the cause of these mineral
doctors i would fain regard them not as willful
wrong-doers but good samaritans erring and is this   
i put it to you sir   is this the view of an arrogant
rival and pretender

his physical power all dribbled and gone the sick
man replied not by voice or by gesture but with feeble
dumb-show of his face seemed to be saying pray leave
me who was ever cured by talk

but the other as if not unused to make allowances
for such despondency proceeded and kindly yet firmly

you tell me that by advice of an eminent physiologist
in louisville you took tincture of iron for what
to restore your lost energy and how why in
healthy subjects iron is naturally found in the blood and
iron in the bar is strong ergo iron is the source of
animal invigoration but you being deficient in vigor
it follows that the cause is deficiency of iron iron then
must be put into you and so your tincture now as
to the theory here i am mute but in modesty assuming
its truth and then as a plain man viewing that
theory in practice i would respectfully question your




eminent physiologist sir i would say though by natural
processes lifeless natures taken as nutriment become
vitalized yet is a lifeless nature under any circumstances
capable of a living transmission with all its qualities
as a lifeless nature unchanged if sir nothing can
be incorporated with the living body but by assimilation
and if that implies the conversion of one thing to a
different thing as in a lamp oil is assimilated into
flame is it in this view likely that by banqueting on
fat calvin edson will fatten that is will what is fat
on the board prove fat on the bones if it will then
sir what is iron in the vial will prove iron in the vein
seems that conclusion too confident

but the sick man again turned his dumb-show look
as much as to say pray leave me why with painful
words hint the vanity of that which the pains of this
body have too painfully proved

but the other as if unobservant of that querulous
look went on

but this notion that science can play farmer to the
flesh making there what living soil it pleases seems not
so strange as that other conceit   that science is now-a-days
so expert that in consumptive cases as yours it
can by prescription of the inhalation of certain vapors
achieve the sublimest act of omnipotence breathing
into all but lifeless dust the breath of life for did you
not tell me my poor sir that by order of the great
chemist in baltimore for three weeks you were never
driven out without a respirator and for a given time of
every day sat bolstered up in a sort of gasometer




inspiring vapors generated by the burning of drugs as if this
concocted atmosphere of man were an antidote to the
poison of god's natural air oh who can wonder at
that old reproach against science that it is atheistical
and here is my prime reason for opposing these chemical
practitioners who have sought out so many inventions
for what do their inventions indicate unless it
be that kind and degree of pride in human skill which
seems scarce compatible with reverential dependence
upon the power above try to rid my mind of it as i
may yet still these chemical practitioners with their
tinctures and fumes and braziers and occult incantations
seem to me like pharaoh's vain sorcerers trying
to beat down the will of heaven day and night in all
charity i intercede for them that heaven may not in
its own language be provoked to anger with their inventions
may not take vengeance of their inventions a
thousand pities that you should ever have been in the
hands of these egyptians

but again came nothing but the dumb-show look as
much as to say pray leave me quacks and indignation
against quacks both are vain

but once more the other went on how different
we herb-doctors who claim nothing invent nothing
but staff in hand in glades and upon hillsides go about
in nature humbly seeking her cures true indian doctors
though not learned in names we are not unfamiliar
with essences   successors of solomon the wise who
knew all vegetables from the cedar of lebanon to the
hyssop on the wall yes solomon was the first of




herb-doctors nor were the virtues of herbs unhonored
by yet older ages is it not writ that on a moonlight
night


medea gathered the enchanted herbs
that did renew old son

ah would you but have confidence you should be
the new son and i your medea a few vials of my
omni-balsamic reinvigorator would i am certain give
you some strength

upon this indignation and abhorrence seemed to
work by their excess the effect promised of the balsam
roused from that long apathy of impotence the cadaverous
man started and in a voice that was as the sound
of obstructed air gurgling through a maze of broken
honey-combs cried begone you are all alike the
name of doctor the dream of helper condemns you for
years i have been but a gallipot for you experimentizers
to rinse your experiments into and now in this livid
skin partake of the nature of my contents begone
i hate ye

i were inhuman could i take affront at a want of
confidence born of too bitter an experience of betrayers
yet permit one who is not without feeling   

begone just in that voice talked to me not six
months ago the german doctor at the water cure from
which i now return six months and sixty pangs nigher
my grave

the water-cure oh fatal delusion of the well-meaning
preisnitz   sir trust me   




begone

nay an invalid should not always have his own
way ah sir reflect how untimely this distrust in one
like you how weak you are and weakness is it not
the time for confidence yes when through weakness
everything bids despair then is the time to get strength
by confidence

relenting in his air the sick man cast upon him a
long glance of beseeching as if saying with confidence
must come hope and how can hope be

the herb-doctor took a sealed paper box from his
surtout pocket and holding it towards him said solemnly
turn not away this may be the last time of health's
asking work upon yourself invoke confidence though
from ashes rouse it for your life rouse it and invoke
it i say

the other trembled was silent and then a little
commanding himself asked the ingredients of the medicine

herbs

what herbs and the nature of them and the
reason for giving them

it cannot be made known

then i will none of you

sedately observant of the juiceless joyless form before
him the herb-doctor was mute a moment then
said   i give up

how

you are sick and a philosopher

no no   not the last




but to demand the ingredient with the reason for
giving is the mark of a philosopher just as the consequence
is the penalty of a fool a sick philosopher is
incurable

why

because he has no confidence

how does that make him incurable

because either he spurns his powder or if he take
it it proves a blank cartridge though the same given to
a rustic in like extremity would act like a charm i
am no materialist but the mind so acts upon the body
that if the one have no confidence neither has the other

again the sick man appeared not unmoved he
seemed to be thinking what in candid truth could be
said to all this at length you talk of confidence
how comes it that when brought low himself the herb-doctor
who was most confident to prescribe in other
cases proves least confident to prescribe in his own
having small confidence in himself for himself

but he has confidence in the brother he calls in
and that he does so is no reproach to him since he
knows that when the body is prostrated the mind is
not erect yes in this hour the herb-doctor does distrust
himself but not his art

the sick man's knowledge did not warrant him to
gainsay this but he seemed not grieved at it glad to
be confuted in a way tending towards his wish

then you give me hope his sunken eye turned up

hope is proportioned to confidence how much
confidence you give me so much hope do i give you




the house is in one sense mrs warren's he said
but a school isn't altogether like a private house it
must be open to inspection to a certain extent at any
time i can easily conceive that a lady at the head
of it might prefer that some examinations should take
place informally as it were

mr don spoke philosophically and as one of the
trustees of a school perhaps too as a man whose
curiosity saw a prospect of gratification if mrs wadham
could only have plenty of room and time miss
minette had more delicacy   

if mother was going on an official visit   if she
was a visitor or on a committee   why even then   
but as the sentence would have had little effect probably
if it had been finished so it never reached any
end for it was cut across by mrs wadham's entrance
and she filled a good deal of space wherever she was

couldn't you send a bouquet to mrs warren
she asked as she came in you'll have enough to
make a show after you've cut off a good many

of course said the daughter we've got plenty of
flowers but i should prefer sending them another
time or taking them in my hand

here here said the mother let me take em
and with very summary fingers she snipped and clipped
and crowded the flowers into one of her hands without
any care for arrangement and then putting the bunch
into mr don's charge and receiving his very courteous
acknowledgment she said   

there those shall be your share to take care of
i like always to have my hands free to take the reins
if any thing should happen

during this time eldridge had brought the carriage




him the box i will be frank with you though
frankness is not always the weakness of the mineral
practitioner yet the herb doctor must be frank or
nothing now then sir in your case a radical cure   
such a cure understand as should make you robust   
such a cure sir i do not and cannot promise

oh you need not only restore me the power of
being something else to others than a burdensome care
and to myself a droning grief only cure me of this
misery of weakness only make me so that i can walk
about in the sun and not draw the flies to me as lured
by the coming of decay only do that   but that

you ask not much you are wise not in vain have
you suffered that little you ask i think can be
granted but remember not in a day nor a week nor
perhaps a month but sooner or later i say not exactly
when for i am neither prophet nor charlatan still if
according to the directions in your box there you take
my medicine steadily without assigning an especial day
near or remote to discontinue it then may you calmly
look for some eventual result of good but again i say
you must have confidence

feverishly he replied that he now trusted he had and
hourly should pray for its increase when suddenly
relapsing into one of those strange caprices peculiar to
some invalids he added but to one like me it is so
hard so hard the most confident hopes so often have
failed me and as often have i vowed never no never
to trust them again oh feebly wringing his hands
you do not know you do not know




i know this that never did a right confidence come
to naught but time is short you hold your cure to
retain or reject

i retain with a clinch and now how much

as much as you can evoke from your heart and
heaven

how   the price of this medicine

i thought it was confidence you meant how much
confidence you should have the medicine   that is
half a dollar a vial your box holds six

the money was paid

now sir said the herb-doctor my business calls
me away and it may so be that i shall never see you
again if then   

he paused for the sick man's countenance fell blank

forgive me cried the other forgive that imprudent
phrase never see you again though i solely
intended it with reference to myself yet i had forgotten
what your sensitiveness might be i repeat then that
it may be that we shall not soon have a second interview
so that hereafter should another of my boxes be needed
you may not be able to replace it except by purchase at
the shops and in so doing you may run more or less
risk of taking some not salutary mixture for such is
the popularity of the omni-balsamic reinvigorator   
thriving not by the credulity of the simple but the
trust of the wise   that certain contrivers have not been
idle though i would not indeed hastily affirm of them
that they are aware of the sad consequences to the
public homicides and murderers some call those




contrivers but i do not for murder if such a crime be
possible comes from the heart and these men's motives
come from the purse were they not in poverty i
think they would hardly do what they do still the
public interests forbid that i should let their needy
device for a living succeed in short i have adopted
precautions take the wrapper from any of my vials
and hold it to the light you will see water-marked in
capitals the word confidence which is the countersign
of the medicine as i wish it was of the world the
wrapper bears that mark or else the medicine is counterfeit
but if still any lurking doubt should remain
pray enclose the wrapper to this address handing a
card and by return mail i will answer

at first the sick man listened with the air of vivid
interest but gradually while the other was still talking
another strange caprice came over him and he presented
the aspect of the most calamitous dejection

how now said the herb-doctor

you told me to have confidence said that confidence
was indispensable and here you preach to me
distrust ah truth will out

i told you you must have confidence unquestioning
confidence i meant confidence in the genuine medicine
and the genuine me 

but in your absence buying vials purporting to be
yours it seems i cannot have unquestioning confidence

prove all the vials trust those which are true

but to doubt to suspect to prove   to have all this




wearing work to be doing continually   how opposed to
confidence it is evil

from evil comes good distrust is a stage to
confidence how has it proved in our interview but
your voice is husky i have let you talk too much
you hold your cure i leave you but stay   when i
hear that health is yours i will not like some i know
vainly make boasts but giving glory where all glory is
due say with the devout herb-doctor japus in virgil
when in the unseen but efficacious presence of venus
he with simples healed the wound of neas   


this is no mortal work no cure of mine
nor art's effect but done by power divine







towards the end of which the herb-doctor proves himself a
forgiver of injuries


in a kind of ante-cabin a number of respectable looking
people male and female way-passengers recently
come on board are listlessly sitting in a mutually shy
sort of silence

holding up a small square bottle ovally labeled
with the engraving of a countenance full of soft pity as
that of the romish-painted madonna the herb-doctor
passes slowly among them benignly urbane turning
this way and that saying   

ladies and gentlemen i hold in my hand here the
samaritan pain dissuader thrice-blessed discovery of
that disinterested friend of humanity whose portrait
you see pure vegetable extract warranted to remove
the acutest pain within less than ten minutes
five hundred dollars to be forfeited on failure especially
efficacious in heart disease and tic-douloureux
observe the expression of this pledged friend of humanity   
price only fifty cents

in vain after the first idle stare his auditors   in
pretty good health it seemed   instead of encouraging




his politeness appeared if anything impatient of it
and perhaps only diffidence or some small regard for
his feelings prevented them from telling him so but
insensible to their coldness or charitably overlooking it
he more wooingly than ever resumed may i venture
upon a small supposition have i your kind
leave ladies and gentlemen

to which modest appeal no one had the kindness to
answer a syllable

well said he resignedly silence is at least not
denial and may be consent my supposition is this
possibly some lady here present has a dear friend at
home a bed-ridden sufferer from spinal complaint if
so what gift more appropriate to that sufferer than this
tasteful little bottle of pain dissuader

again he glanced about him but met much the same
reception as before those faces alien alike to sympathy
or surprise seemed patiently to say we are travelers
and as such must expect to meet and quietly
put up with many antic fools and more antic quacks

ladies and gentlemen deferentially fixing his eyes
upon their now self-complacent faces ladies and gentlemen
might i by your kind leave venture upon one
other small supposition it is this that there is scarce
a sufferer this noonday writhing on his bed but in his
hour he sat satisfactorily healthy and happy that the
samaritan pain dissuader is the one only balm for
that to which each living creature   who knows   may
be a draughted victim present or prospective in
short   oh happiness on my right hand and oh




security on my left can ye wisely adore a providence
and not think it wisdom to provide   provide uplifting
the bottle

what immediate effect if any this appeal might have
had is uncertain for just then the boat touched at a
houseless landing scooped as by a land-slide out of
sombre forests back through which led a road the
sole one which from its narrowness and its being
walled up with story on story of dusk matted foliage
presented the vista of some cavernous old gorge in a
city like haunted cock lane in london issuing from
that road and crossing that landing there stooped his
shaggy form in the door-way and entered the ante-cabin
with a step so burdensome that shot seemed in his
pockets a kind of invalid titan in homespun his beard
blackly pendant like the carolina-moss and dank with
cypress dew his countenance tawny and shadowy as
an iron-ore country in a clouded day in one hand he
carried a heavy walking-stick of swamp-oak with the
other led a puny girl walking in moccasins not improbably
his child but evidently of alien maternity
perhaps creole or even camanche her eye would
have been large for a woman and was inky as the pools
of falls among mountain-pines an indian blanket
orange-hued and fringed with lead tassel-work appeared
that morning to have shielded the child from
heavy showers her limbs were tremulous she seemed
a little cassandra in nervousness

no sooner was the pair spied by the herb-doctor than
with a cheerful air both arms extended like a host's he




advanced and taking the child's reluctant hand said
trippingly on your travels ah my little may queen
glad to see you what pretty moccasins nice to
dance in then with a half caper sang   


hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle
 the cow jumped over the moon

come chirrup chirrup my little robin

which playful welcome drew no responsive playfulness
from the child nor appeared to gladden or conciliate
the father but rather if anything to dash the dead
weight of his heavy-hearted expression with a smile
hypochondriacally scornful

sobering down now the herb-doctor addressed the
stranger in a manly business-like way   a transition
which though it might seem a little abrupt did not
appear constrained and indeed served to show that his
recent levity was less the habit of a frivolous nature
than the frolic condescension of a kindly heart

excuse me said he but if i err not i was speaking
to you the other day   on a kentucky boat wasn't
it

never to me was the reply the voice deep and
lonesome enough to have come from the bottom of an
abandoned coal-shaft

ah   but am i again mistaken his eye falling on
the swamp-oak stick or don't you go a little lame
sir

never was lame in my life

indeed i fancied i had perceived not a limp but




a hitch a slight hitch   some experience in these
things   divined some hidden cause of the hitch   buried
bullet may be   some dragoons in the mexican war discharged
with such you know   hard fate he sighed
little pity for it for who sees it   have you dropped
anything

why there is no telling but the stranger was bowed
over and might have seemed bowing for the purpose of
picking up something were it not that as arrested
in the imperfect posture he for the moment so remained
slanting his tall stature like a mainmast yielding
to the gale or adam to the thunder

the little child pulled him with a kind of a surge
he righted himself for an instant looked toward the
herb-doctor but either from emotion or aversion or
both together withdrew his eyes saying nothing presently
still stooping he seated himself drawing his child
between his knees his massy hands tremulous and still
averting his face while up into the compassionate one
of the herb-doctor the child turned a fixed melancholy
glance of repugnance

the herb-doctor stood observant a moment then
said

surely you have pain strong pain somewhere in
strong frames pain is strongest try now my specific
holding it up do but look at the expression
of this friend of humanity trust me certain cure for
any pain in the world won't you look

no choked the other

very good merry time to you little may queen




and so as if he would intrude his cure upon no one
moved pleasantly off again crying his wares nor now
at last without result a new-comer not from the
shore but another part of the boat a sickly young
man after some questions purchased a bottle upon
this others of the company began a little to wake up
as it were the scales of indifference or prejudice fell
from their eyes now at last they seemed to have an
inkling that here was something not undesirable which
might be had for the buying

but while ten times more briskly bland than ever
the herb-doctor was driving his benevolent trade accompanying
each sale with added praises of the thing
traded all at once the dusk giant seated at some distance
unexpectedly raised his voice with   

what was that you last said

the question was put distinctly yet resonantly as
when a great clock-bell   stunning admonisher   strikes
one and the stroke though single comes bedded in
the belfry clamor

all proceedings were suspended hands held forth
for the specific were withdrawn while every eye turned
towards the direction whence the question came but
no way abashed the herb-doctor elevating his voice
with even more than wonted self-possession replied   

i was saying what since you wish it i cheerfully
repeat that the samaritan pain dissuader which i here
hold in my hand will either cure or ease any pain
you please within ten minutes after its application

does it produce insensibility




by no means not the least of its merits is that
it is not an opiate it kills pain without killing
feeling

you lie some pains cannot be eased but by producing
insensibility and cannot be cured but by producing
death

beyond this the dusk giant said nothing neither for
impairing the other's market did there appear much
need to after eying the rude speaker a moment with
an expression of mingled admiration and consternation
the company silently exchanged glances of mutual sympathy
under unwelcome conviction those who had
purchased looked sheepish or ashamed and a cynicallooking
little man with a thin flaggy beard and a
countenance ever wearing the rudiments of a grin
seated alone in a corner commanding a good view of
the scene held a rusty hat before his face

but again the herb-doctor without noticing the retort
overbearing though it was began his panegyrics
anew and in a tone more assured than before going so
far now as to say that his specific was sometimes almost
as effective in cases of mental suffering as in cases
of physical or rather to be more precise in cases
when through sympathy the two sorts of pain coperated
into a climax of both   in such cases he said the
specific had done very well he cited an example
only three bottles faithfully taken cured a louisiana
widow for three weeks sleepless in a darkened chamber
of neuralgic sorrow for the loss of husband and
child swept off in one night by the last epidemic for




the truth of this a printed voucher was produced duly
signed

while he was reading it aloud a sudden side-blow
all but felled him

it was the giant who with a countenance lividly
epileptic with hypochondriac mania exclaimed   

profane fiddler on heart-strings snake

more he would have added but convulsed could
not so without another word taking up the child
who had followed him went with a rocking pace out of
the cabin

regardless of decency and lost to humanity
exclaimed the herb-doctor with much ado recovering
himself then after a pause during which he examined
his bruise not omitting to apply externally a little
of his specific and with some success as it would
seem plained to himself

no no i won't seek redress innocence is my redress
but turning upon them all if that man's
wrathful blow provokes me to no wrath should his evil
distrust arouse you to distrust i do devoutly hope
proudly raising voice and arm for the honor of
humanity   hope that despite this coward assault the
samaritan pain dissuader stands unshaken in the confidence
of all who hear me

but injured as he was and patient under it too
somehow his case excited as little compassion as his
oratory now did enthusiasm still pathetic to the last
he continued his appeals notwithstanding the frigid
regard of the company till suddenly interrupting




himself as if in reply to a quick summons from without he
said hurriedly i come i come and so with every
token of precipitate dispatch out of the cabin the
herb-doctor went







inquest into the true character of the herb-doctor


 sha'n't see that fellow again in a hurry remarked
an auburn-haired gentleman to his neighbor with a hook-nose
never knew an operator so completely unmasked

but do you think it the fair thing to unmask an
operator that way

fair it is right

supposing that at high change on the paris bourse
asmodeus should lounge in distributing hand-bills revealing
the true thoughts and designs of all the operators
present   would that be the fair thing in asmodeus
or as hamlet says were it to consider the thing too
curiously

we won't go into that but since you admit the
fellow to be a knave   

i don't admit it or if i did i take it back
shouldn't wonder if after all he is no knave at all or
but little of one what can you prove against him

i can prove that he makes dupes

many held in honor do the same and many not
wholly knaves do it too




how about that last

he is not wholly at heart a knave i fancy among
whose dupes is himself did you not see our quack
friend apply to himself his own quackery a fanatic
quack essentially a fool though effectively a
knave

bending over and looking down between his knees
on the floor the auburn-haired gentleman meditatively
scribbled there awhile with his cane then glancing up
said

i can't conceive how you in any way can hold
him a fool how he talked   so glib so pat so
well

a smart fool always talks well takes a smart fool
to be tonguey

in much the same strain the discussion continued   
the hook-nosed gentleman talking at large and excellently
with a view of demonstrating that a smart fool
always talks just so ere long he talked to such purpose
as almost to convince

presently back came the person of whom the auburn-haired
gentleman had predicted that he would not
return conspicuous in the door-way he stood saying
in a clear voice is the agent of the seminole widow
and orphan asylum within here

no one replied

is there within here any agent or any member of
any charitable institution whatever

no one seemed competent to answer or no one
thought it worth while to




if there be within here any such person i have in
my hand two dollars for him

some interest was manifested

i was called away so hurriedly i forgot this part of
my duty with the proprietor of the samaritan pain
dissuader it is a rule to devote on the spot to some
benevolent purpose the half of the proceeds of sales
eight bottles were disposed of among this company
hence four half-dollars remain to charity who as
steward takes the money

one or two pair of feet moved upon the floor as with
a sort of itching but nobody rose

does diffidence prevail over duty if i say there
be any gentleman or any lady either here present who
is in any connection with any charitable institution
whatever let him or her come forward he or she
happening to have at hand no certificate of such connection
makes no difference not of a suspicious
temper thank god i shall have confidence in whoever
offers to take the money

a demure-looking woman in a dress rather tawdry
and rumpled here drew her veil well down and rose
but marking every eye upon her thought it advisable
upon the whole to sit down again

is it to be believed that in this christian company
there is no one charitable person i mean no one connected
with any charity well then is there no object
of charity here

upon this an unhappy-looking woman in a sort of
mourning neat but sadly worn hid her face behind a




meagre bundle and was heard to sob meantime as
not seeing or hearing her the herb-doctor again spoke
and this time not unpathetically

are there none here who feel in need of help and
who in accepting such help would feel that they in
their time have given or done more than may ever be
given or done to them man or woman is there none
such here

the sobs of the woman were more audible though
she strove to repress them while nearly every one's
attention was bent upon her a man of the appearance of
a day-laborer with a white bandage across his face concealing
the side of the nose and who for coolness sake
had been sitting in his red-flannel shirt-sleeves his coat
thrown across one shoulder the darned cuffs drooping
behind   this man shufflingly rose and with a pace that
seemed the lingering memento of the lock-step of convicts
went up for a duly-qualified claimant

poor wounded huzzar sighed the herb-doctor and
dropping the money into the man's clam-shell of a hand
turned and departed

the recipient of the alms was about moving after
when the auburn-haired gentleman staid him don't
be frightened you but i want to see those coins
yes yes good silver good silver there take them
again and while you are about it go bandage the rest
of yourself behind something d'ye hear consider
yourself wholly the scar of a nose and be off with
yourself

being of a forgiving nature or else from emotion not




daring to trust his voice the man silently but not
without some precipitancy withdrew

strange said the auburn-haired gentleman returning
to his friend the money was good money

aye and where your fine knavery now knavery
to devote the half of one's receipts to charity he's a
fool i say again

others might call him an original genius

yes being original in his folly genius his
genius is a cracked pate and as this age goes not
much originality about that

may he not be knave fool and genius altogether

i beg pardon here said a third person with a gossiping
expression who had been listening but you are
somewhat puzzled by this man and well you may be

do you know anything about him asked the
hooked-nosed gentleman

no but i suspect him for something

suspicion we want knowledge

well suspect first and know next true knowledge
comes but by suspicion or revelation that's my
maxim

and yet said the auburn-haired gentleman since
a wise man will keep even some certainties to himself
much more some suspicions at least he will at all events
so do till they ripen into knowledge

do you hear that about the wise man said the
hook-nosed gentleman turning upon the new comer
now what is it you suspect of this fellow

i shrewdly suspect him was the eager response




for one of those jesuit emissaries prowling all over our
country the better to accomplish their secret designs
they assume at times i am told the most singular
masques sometimes in appearance the absurdest

this though indeed for some reason causing a droll
smile upon the face of the hook-nosed gentleman added
a third angle to the discussion which now became a
sort of triangular duel and ended at last with but a
triangular result






a soldier of fortune


 mexico molino del rey resaca de la palma

resaca de la tombs 

leaving his reputation to take care of itself since as
is not seldom the case he knew nothing of its being in
debate the herb-doctor wandering to wardsthe forward
part of the boat had there espied a singular character in a
grimy old regimental coat a countenance at once grim
and wizened interwoven paralyzed legs stiff as icicles
suspended between rude crutches while the whole
rigid body like a ship's long barometer on gimbals
swung to and fro mechanically faithful to the motion
of the boat looking downward while he swung the
cripple seemed in a brown study

as moved by the sight and conjecturing that here
was some battered hero from the mexican battle-fields
the herb-doctor had sympathetically accosted him as
above and received the above rather dubious reply as
with a half moody half surly sort of air that reply was
given the cripple by a voluntary jerk nervously increased
his swing his custom when seized by emotion so that




one would have thought some squall had suddenly rolled
the boat and with it the barometer

tombs my friend exclaimed the herb-doctor in
mild surprise you have not descended to the dead
have you i had imagined you a scarred campaigner
one of the noble children of war for your dear country
a glorious sufferer but you are lazarus it seems

yes he who had sores

ah the other lazarus but i never knew that
either of them was in the army glancing at the dilapidated
regimentals

that will do now jokes enough

friend said the other reproachfully you think
amiss on principle i greet unfortunates with some
pleasant remark the better to call off their thoughts
from their troubles the physician who is at once wise
and humane seldom unreservedly sympathizes with his
patient but come i am a herb-doctor and also a natural
bone-setter i may be sanguine but i think i
can do something for you you look up now give me
your story ere i undertake a cure i require a full account
of the case

you can't help me returned the cripple gruffly
go away

you seem sadly destitute of   

no i ain't destitute to-day at least i can pay my
way

the natural bone-setter is happy indeed to hear
that but you were premature i was deploring your
destitution not of cash but of confidence you think




the natural bone-setter can't help you well suppose
he can't have you any objection to telling him your
story you my friend have in a signal way experienced
adversity tell me then for my private good
how without aid from the noble cripple epictetus you
have arrived at his heroic sang-froid in misfortune

at these words the cripple fixed upon the speaker the
hard ironic eye of one toughened and defiant in misery
and in the end grinned upon him with his unshaven face
like an ogre

come come be sociable   be human my friend
don't make that face it distresses me

i suppose with a sneer you are the man i've
long heard of   the happy man

happy my friend yes at least i ought to be
my conscience is peaceful i have confidence in everybody
i have confidence that in my humble profession
i do some little good to the world yes i think that
without presumption i may venture to assent to the
proposition that i am the happy man   the happy bone-setter

then you shall hear my story many a month i
have longed to get hold of the happy man drill him
drop the powder and leave him to explode at his
leisure

what a demoniac unfortunate exclaimed the herb-doctor
retreating regular infernal machine

look ye cried the other stumping after him and
with his horny hand catching him by a horn button my
name is thomas fry until my   




   any relation of mrs fry interrupted the other
i still correspond with that excellent lady on the subject
of prisons tell me are you anyway connected
with my mrs fry

blister mrs fry what do them sentimental souls
know of prisons or any other black fact i'll tell ye
a story of prisons ha ha

the herb-doctor shrank and with reason the laugh
being strangely startling

positively my friend said he you must stop
that i can't stand that no more of that i hope i
have the milk of kindness but your thunder will soon
turn it

hold i haven't come to the milk-turning part yet
my name is thomas fry until my twenty-third year
i went by the nickname of happy tom   happy   ha
ha they called me happy tom d'ye see because i was
so good-natured and laughing all the time just as i am
now   ha ha

upon this the herb-doctor would perhaps have run
but once more the hyna clawed him presently
sobering down he continued

well i was born in new york and there i lived a
steady hard-working man a cooper by trade one
evening i went to a political meeting in the park   for
you must know i was in those days a great patriot as
bad luck would have it there was trouble near between
a gentleman who had been drinking wine and a pavior
who was sober the pavior chewed tobacco and the
gentleman said it was beastly in him and pushed him




wanting to have his place the pavior chewed on and
pushed back well the gentleman carried a swordcane
and presently the pavior was down   skewered

how was that

why you see the pavior undertook something above
his strength

the other must have been a samson then strong
as a pavior is a proverb

so it is and the gentleman was in body a rather
weakly man but for all that i say again the pavior
undertook something above his strength

what are you talking about he tried to maintain
his rights didn't he

yes but for all that i say again he undertook
something above his strength

i don't understand you but go on

along with the gentleman i with other witnesses
was taken to the tombs there was an examination
and to appear at the trial the gentleman and witnesses
all gave bail   i mean all but me

and why didn't you

couldn't get it

steady hard-working cooper like you what was
the reason you couldn't get bail

steady hard-working cooper hadn't no friends
well souse i went into a wet cell like a canal-boat
splashing into the lock locked up in pickle d'ye see
against the time of the trial

but what had you done




why i hadn't got any friends i tell ye a worse
crime than murder as ye'll see afore long

murder did the wounded man die

died the third night

then the gentleman's bail didn't help him imprisoned
now wasn't he

had too many friends no it was i that was
imprisoned   but i was going on they let me walk
about the corridor by day but at night i must into lock
there the wet and the damp struck into my bones they
doctored me but no use when the trial came i was
boosted up and said my say

and what was that

my say was that i saw the steel go in and saw it
sticking in

and that hung the gentleman

hung him with a gold chain his friends called a
meeting in the park and presented him with a gold
watch and chain upon his acquittal

acquittal

didn't i say he had friends

there was a pause broken at last by the herb-doctor's
saying well there is a bright side to everything
if this speak prosaically for justice it speaks romantically
for friendship but go on my fine fellow

my say being said they told me i might go i said
i could not without help so the constables helped me
asking where would i go i told them back to the
tombs i knew no other place but where are your
friends said they i have none so they put me




into a hand-barrow with an awning to it and wheeled
me down to the dock and on board a boat and away to
blackwell's island to the corporation hospital there
i got worse   got pretty much as you see me now
couldn't cure me after three years i grew sick of
lying in a grated iron bed alongside of groaning thieves
and mouldering burglars they gave me five silver dollars
and these crutches and i hobbled off i had an
only brother who went to indiana years ago i begged
about to make up a sum to go to him got to
indiana at last and they directed me to his grave it
was on a great plain in a log-church yard with a stump
fence the old gray roots sticking all ways like mooseantlers
the bier set over the grave it being the last
dug was of green hickory bark on and green twigs
sprouting from it some one had planted a bunch of violets
on the mound but it was a poor soil always choose
the poorest soils for grave-yards and they were all dried
to tinder i was going to sit and rest myself on the bier
and think about my brother in heaven but the bier
broke down the legs being only tacked so after
driving some hogs out of the yard that were rooting
there i came away and not to make too long a story
of it here i am drifting down stream like any other bit
of wreck

the herb-doctor was silent for a time buried in
thought at last raising his head he said i have
considered your whole story my friend and strove to
consider it in the light of a commentary on what i
believe to be the system of things but it so jars with all




is so incompatible with all that you must pardon me
if i honestly tell you i cannot believe it

that don't surprise me

how

hardly anybody believes my story and so to most
i tell a different one

how again

wait here a bit and i'll show ye

with that taking off his rag of a cap and arranging
his tattered regimentals the best he could off he went
stumping among the passengers in an adjoining part of
the deck saying with a jovial kind of air sir a
shilling for happy tom who fought at buena vista
lady something for general scott's soldier crippled in
both pins at glorious contreras

now it so chanced that unbeknown to the cripple a
prim-looking stranger had overheard part of his story
beholding him then on his present begging adventure
this person turning to the herb-doctor indignantly said
is it not too bad sir that yonder rascal should lie
so

charity never faileth my good sir was the reply
the vice of this unfortunate is pardonable consider
he lies not out of wantonness

not out of wantonness i never heard more wanton
lies in one breath to tell you what would appear to
be his true story and in the next away and falsify it

for all that i repeat he lies not out of wantonness
a ripe philosopher turned out of the great sorbonne of
hard times he thinks that woes when told to strangers




for money are best sugared though the inglorious
lock-jaw of his knee-pans in a wet dungeon is a far
more pitiable ill than to have been crippled at glorious
contreras yet he is of opinion that this lighter and
false ill shall attract while the heavier and real one
might repel

nonsense he belongs to the devil's regiment and
i have a great mind to expose him

shame upon you dare to expose that poor unfortunate
and by heaven   don't you do it sir

noting something in his manner the other thought it
more prudent to retire than retort by-and-by the
cripple came back and with glee having reaped a pretty
good harvest

there he laughed you know now what sort of
soldier i am

aye one that fights not the stupid mexican but a
foe worthy your tactics   fortune

hi hi clamored the cripple like a fellow in the
pit of a sixpenny theatre then said don't know much
what you meant but it went off well

this over his countenance capriciously put on a
morose ogreness to kindly questions he gave no kindly
answers unhandsome notions were thrown out
about free ameriky as he sarcastically called his country
these seemed to disturb and pain the herb-doctor
who after an interval of thoughtfulness gravely addressed
him in these words

you my worthy friend to my concern have reflected
upon the government under which you live and




suffer where is your patriotism where your gratitude
true the charitable may find something in your case
as you put it partly to account for such reflections as
coming from you still be the facts how they may
your reflections are none the less unwarrantable grant
for the moment that your experiences are as you give
them in which case i would admit that government
might be thought to have more or less to do with what
seems undesirable in them but it is never to be forgotten
that human government being subordinate to the
divine must needs therefore in its degree partake of
the characteristics of the divine that is while in general
efficacious to happiness the world's law may yet in
some cases have to the eye of reason an unequal operation
just as in the same imperfect view some inequalities
may appear in the operations of heaven's law
nevertheless to one who has a right confidence final
benignity is in every instance as sure with the one law
as the other i expound the point at some length
because these are the considerations my poor fellow
which weighed as they merit will enable you to sustain
with unimpaired trust the apparent calamities which
are yours

what do you talk your hog-latin to me for cried
the cripple who throughout the address betrayed the
most illiterate obduracy and with an incensed look
anew he swung himself

glancing another way till the spasm passed the
other continued

charity marvels not that you should be somewhat




hard of conviction my friend since you doubltess
believe yourself hardly dealt by but forget not that
those who are loved are chastened

mustn't chasten them too much though and too
long because their skin and heart get hard and feel
neither pain nor tickle

to mere reason your case looks something piteous
i grant but never despond many things   the
choicest   yet remain you breathe this bounteous air
are warmed by this gracious sun and though poor and
friendless indeed nor so agile as in your youth yet how
sweet to roam day by day through the groves plucking
the bright mosses and flowers till forlornness itself
becomes a hilarity and in your innocent independence
you skip for joy

fine skipping with these ere horse-posts   ha ha

pardon i forgot the crutches my mind figuring
you after receiving the benefit of my art overlooked
you as you stand before me

your art you call yourself a bone-setter   a natural
bone-setter do ye go bone-set the crooked world
and then come bone-set crooked me

truly my honest friend i thank you for again recalling
me to my original object let me examine you
bending down ah i see i see much such a case as the
negro's did you see him oh no you came aboard
since well his case was a little something like yours
i prescribed for him and i shouldn't wonder at all if in
a very short time he were able to walk almost as well
as myself now have you no confidence in my art




ha ha

the herb-doctor averted himself but the wild laugh
dying away resumed

i will not force confidence on you still i would
fain do the friendly thing by you here take this box
just rub that liniment on the joints night and morning
take it nothing to pay god bless you good-bye

stay pausing in his swing not untouched by so
unexpected an act stay   thank'ee   but will this
really do me good honor bright now will it don't
deceive a poor fellow with changed mien and glistening
eye

try it good-bye

stay stay sure it will do me good

possibly possibly no harm in trying good-bye

stay stay give me three more boxes and here's
the money

my friend returning towards him with a sadly
pleased sort of air i rejoice in the birth of your confidence
and hopefulness believe me that like your
crutches confidence and hopefulness will long support
a man when his own legs will not stick to confidence
and hopefulness then since how mad for the cripple to
throw his crutches away you ask for three more boxes
of my liniment luckily i have just that number remaining
here they are i sell them at half-a-dollar
apiece but i shall take nothing from you there
god bless you again good-bye




stay in a convulsed voice and rocking himself
stay stay you have made a better man of me you
have borne with me like a good christian and talked to
me like one and all that is enough without making me
a present of these boxes here is the money i won't
take nay there there and may almighty goodness
go with you

as the herb-doctor withdrew the cripple gradually
subsided from his hard rocking into a gentle oscillation
it expressed perhaps the soothed mood of his
reverie






reappearance of one who may be remembered


the herb-doctor had not moved far away when in
advance of him this spectacle met his eye a dried-up
old man with the stature of a boy of twelve was tottering
about like one out of his mind in rumpled
clothes of old moleskin showing recent contact with
bedding his ferret eyes blinking in the sunlight of the
snowy boat as imbecilely eager and at intervals coughing
he peered hither and thither as if in alarmed search
for his nurse he presented the aspect of one who
bed-rid has through overruling excitement like that of
a fire been stimulated to his feet

you seek some one said the herb-doctor accosting
him can i assist you

do do i am so old and miserable coughed the
old man where is he this long time i've been trying
to get up and find him but i haven't any friends
and couldn't get up till now where is he

who do you mean drawing closer to stay the
further wanderings of one so weakly

why why why now marking the other's dress
why you yes you   you you   ugh ugh ugh




i

ugh ugh ugh   you are the man he spoke of
who is he

faith that is just what i want to know

mercy mercy coughed the old man bewildered
ever since seeing him my head spins round so i
ought to have a guard ee an is this a snuff-colored surtout
of yours or ain't it somehow can't trust my
senses any more since trusting him   ugh ugh ugh

oh you have trusted somebody glad to hear it
glad to hear of any instance of that sort reflects well
upon all men but you inquire whether this is a snuff-colored
surtout i answer it is and will add that a
herb-doctor wears it

upon this the old man in his broken way replied
that then he the herb-doctor was the person he
sought   the person spoken of by the other person as
yet unknown he then with flighty eagerness wanted
to know who this last person was and where he was
and whether he could be trusted with money to treble it

aye now i begin to understand ten to one you
mean my worthy friend who in pure goodness of heart
makes people's fortunes for them   their everlasting fortunes
as the phrase goes   only charging his one small
commission of confidence aye aye before intrusting
funds with my friend you want to know about him
very proper   and i am glad to assure you you need
have no hesitation none none just none in the world
bona fide none turned me in a trice a hundred dollars
the other day into as many eagles




did he did he but where is he take me to
him

pray take my arm the boat is large we may
have something of a hunt come on ah is that he

where where

o no i took yonder coat-skirts for his but no
my honest friend would never turn tail that way
ah   

where where

another mistake surprising resemblance i took
yonder clergyman for him come on

having searched that part of the boat without success
they went to another part and while exploring that
the boat sided up to a landing when as the two were
passing by the open guard the herb-doctor suddenly
rushed towards the disembarking throng crying out
mr truman mr truman there he goes   that's he
mr truman mr truman   confound that steam-pipe
mr truman for god's sake mr truman   no no   
there the plank's in   too late   we're off

with that the huge boat with a mighty walrus
wallow rolled away from the shore resuming her
course

how vexatious exclaimed the herb-doctor returning
had we been but one single moment sooner   
there he goes now towards yon hotel his portmanteau
following you see him don't you

where where

can't see him any more wheel-house shot between
i am very sorry i should have so liked you




to have let him have a hundred or so of your money
you would have been pleased with the investment believe
me

oh i have let him have some of my money
groaned the old man

you have my dear sir seizing both the miser's
hands in both his own and heartily shaking them my
dear sir how i congratulate you you don't know

ugh ugh i fear i don't with another groan
his name is truman is it

john truman

where does he live

in st louis

where's his office

let me see jones street number one hundred
and   no no   anyway it's somewhere or other up-stairs
in jones street

can't you remember the number try now

one hundred   two hundred   three hundred   

oh my hundred dollars i wonder whether it will
be one hundred two hundred three hundred with
them ugh ugh can't remember the number

positively though i once knew i have forgotten
quite forgotten it strange but never mind you
will easily learn in st louis he is well known
there

but i have no receipt   ugh ugh nothing to
show   don't know where i stand   ought to have a
guard ee an   ugh ugh don't know anything ugh
ugh




why you know that you gave him your confidence
don't you

oh yes

well then

but what what   how how   ugh ugh

why didn't he tell you

no

what didn't he tell you that it was a secret a
mystery

oh   yes

well then

but i have no bond

don't need any with mr truman mr truman's
word is his bond

but how am i to get my profits   ugh ugh   and
my money back don't know anything ugh ugh

oh you must have confidence

don't say that word again makes my head spin
so oh i'm so old and miserable nobody caring for
me everybody fleecing me and my head spins so   ugh
ugh   and this cough racks me so i say again i ought
to have a guard ee an

so you ought and mr truman is your guardian to
the extent you invested with him sorry we missed
him just now but you'll hear from him all right
it's imprudent though to expose yourself this way
let me take you to your berth

forlornly enough the old miser moved slowly away
with him but while descending a stairway he was
seized with such coughing that he was fain to pause




that is a very bad cough

church-yard   ugh ugh   church-yard cough   
ugh

have you tried anything for it

tired of trying nothing does me any good   ugh
ugh not even the mammoth cave ugh ugh
denned there six months but coughed so bad the rest
of the coughers   ugh ugh   black-balled me out
ugh ugh nothing does me good

but have you tried the omni-balsamic reinvigorator
sir

that's what that truman   ugh ugh   said i
ought to take yarb-medicine you are that yarb-doctor
too

the same suppose you try one of my boxes now
trust me from what i know of mr truman he is not
the gentleman to recommend even in behalf of a friend
anything of whose excellence he is not conscientiously
satisfied

ugh   how much

only two dollars a box

two dollars why don't you say two millions
ugh ugh two dollars that's two hundred cents
that's eight hundred farthings that's two thousand
mills and all for one little box of yarb-medicine my
head my head   oh i ought to have a guard ee an for
my head ugh ugh ugh ugh

well if two dollars a box seems too much take a
dozen boxes at twenty dollars and that will be getting
four boxes for nothing and you need use none but those




four the rest you can retail out at a premium and so
cure your cough and make money by it come you
had better do it cash down can fill an order in a
day or two here now producing a box pure
herbs

at that moment seized with another spasm the miser
snatched each interval to fix his half distrustful half
hopeful eye upon the medicine held alluringly up
sure   ugh sure it's all nat'ral nothing but
yarbs if i only thought it was a purely nat'ral medicine
now   all yarbs   ugh ugh   oh this cough this
cough   ugh ugh   shatters my whole body ugh
ugh ugh

for heaven's sake try my medicine if but a single
box that it is pure nature you may be confident
refer you to mr truman

don't know his number   ugh ugh ugh ugh oh
this cough he did speak well of this medicine though
said solemnly it would cure me   ugh ugh ugh ugh   
take off a dollar and i'll have a box

can't sir can't

say a dollar-and-half ugh

can't am pledged to the one-price system only
honorable one

take off a shilling   ugh ugh

can't

ugh ugh ugh   i'll take it   there

grudgingly he handed eight silver coins but while
still in his hand his cough took him and they were
shaken upon the deck




one by one the herb-doctor picked them up and
examining them said these are not quarters these
are pistareens and clipped and sweated at that

oh don't be so miserly   ugh ugh   better a beast
than a miser   ugh ugh

well let it go anything rather than the idea of
your not being cured of such a cough and i hope for
the credit of humanity you have not made it appear
worse than it is merely with a view to working upon
the weak point of my pity and so getting my medicine
the cheaper now mind don't take it till night just
before retiring is the time there you can get along
now can't you i would attend you further but i land
presently and must go hunt up my luggage






a hard case


 yarbs yarbs natur natur you foolish old file
you he diddled you with that hocus-pocus did he
yarbs and natur will cure your incurable cough you
think

it was a rather eccentric-looking person who spoke
somewhat ursine in aspect sporting a shaggy spencer
of the cloth called bear's-skin a high-peaked cap of raccoon-skin
the long bushy tail switching over behind
raw-hide leggings grim stubble chin and to end a
double-barreled gun in hand   a missouri bachelor a
hoosier gentleman of spartan leisure and fortune and
equally spartan manners and sentiments and as the
sequel may show not less acquainted in a spartan way
of his own with philosophy and books than with wood-craft
and rifles

he must have overheard some of the talk between the
miser and the herb-doctor for just after the withdrawal
of the one he made up to the other   now at the foot
of the stairs leaning against the baluster there   with the
greeting above

think it will cure me coughed the miser in echo




why shouldn't it the medicine is nat'ral yarbs
pure yarbs yarbs must cure me

because a thing is nat'ral as you call it you think
it must be good but who gave you that cough was
it or was it not nature

sure you don't think that natur dame natur will
hurt a body do you

natur is good queen bess but who's responsible
for the cholera

but yarbs yarbs yarbs are good

what's deadly-nightshade yarb ain't it

oh that a christian man should speak agin natur
and yarbs   ugh ugh ugh   ain't sick men sent out into
the country sent out to natur and grass

aye and poets send out the sick spirit to green
pastures like lame horses turned out unshod to the turf
to renew their hoofs a sort of yarb-doctors in their
way poets have it that for sore hearts as for sore lungs
nature is the grand cure but who froze to death my
teamster on the prairie and who made an idiot of
peter the wild boy

then you don't believe in these ere yarb-doctors

yarb-doctors i remember the lank yarb-doctor
i saw once on a hospital-cot in mobile one of the
faculty passing round and seeing who lay there said
with professional triumph ah dr green your yarbs
don't help ye now dr green have to come to us and
the mercury now dr green   natur y-a-r-b-s

did i hear something about herbs and herb-doctors
here said a flute-like voice advancing




it was the herb-doctor in person carpet-bag in
hand he happened to be strolling back that way

pardon me addressing the missourian but if i
caught your words aright you would seem to have little
confidence in nature which really in my way of
thinking looks like carrying the spirit of distrust pretty
far

and who of my sublime species may you be
turning short round upon him clicking his rifle-lock
with an air which would have seemed half cynic half
wild-cat were it not for the grotesque excess of the expression
which made its sincerity appear more or less
dubious

one who has confidence in nature and confidence
in man with some little modest confidence in himself

that's your confession of faith is it confidence
in man eh pray which do you think are most
knaves or fools

having met with few or none of either i hardly
think i am competent to answer

i will answer for you fools are most

why do you think so

for the same reason that i think oats are numerically
more than horses don't knaves munch up fools
just as horses do oats

a droll sir you are a droll i can appreciate
drollery   ha ha ha

but i'm in earnest

that's the drollery to deliver droll extravagance
with an earnest air   knaves munching up fools as horses




oats   faith very droll indeed ha ha ha yes i
think i understand you now sir how silly i was to
have taken you seriously in your droll conceits too
about having no confidence in nature in reality you
have just as much as i have

 i have confidence in nature i i say again there
is nothing i am more suspicious of i once lost ten
thousand dollars by nature nature embezzled that
amount from me absconded with ten thousand dollars
worth of my property a plantation on this stream
swept clean away by one of those sudden shiftings of
the banks in a freshet ten thousand dollars worth of
alluvion thrown broad off upon the waters

but have you no confidence that by a reverse shifting
that soil will come back after many days   ah here
is my venerable friend observing the old miser not
in your berth yet pray if you will keep afoot don't
lean against that baluster take my arm

it was taken and the two stood together the old
miser leaning against the herb-doctor with something of
that air of trustful fraternity with which when standing
the less strong of the siamese twins habitually leans
against the other

the missourian eyed them in silence which was
broken by the herb-doctor

you look surprised sir is it because i publicly
take under my protection a figure like this but i am
never ashamed of honesty whatever his coat

look you said the missourian after a scrutinizing
pause you are a queer sort of chap don't know




exactly what to make of you upon the whole though
you somewhat remind me of the last boy i had on my
place

good trustworthy boy i hope

oh very i am now started to get me made some
kind of machine to do the sort of work which boys are
supposed to be fitted for

then you have passed a veto upon boys

and men too

but my dear sir does not that again imply more or
less lack of confidence   stand up a little just a very
little my venerable friend you lean rather hard   no
confidence in boys no confidence in men no confidence
in nature pray sir who or what may you have confidence
in

i have confidence in distrust more particularly as
applied to you and your herbs

well with a forbearing smile that is frank but
pray don't forget that when you suspect my herbs you
suspect nature

didn't i say that before

very good for the argument's sake i will suppose
you are in earnest now can you who suspect nature
deny that this same nature not only kindly brought you
into being but has faithfully nursed you to your present
vigorous and independent condition is it not to nature
that you are indebted for that robustness of mind
which you so unhandsomely use to her scandal pray
is it not to nature that you owe the very eyes by which
you criticise her




no for the privilege of vision i am indebted to an
oculist who in my tenth year operated upon me in philadelphia
nature made me blind and would have kept
me so my oculist counterplotted her

and yet sir by your complexion i judge you live
an out-of-door life without knowing it you are
partial to nature you fly to nature the universal
mother

very motherly sir in the passion-fits of nature
i've known birds fly from nature to me rough as i look
yes sir in a tempest refuge here smiting the folds of
his bearskin fact sir fact come come mr palaverer
for all your palavering did you yourself never
shut out nature of a cold wet night bar her out
bolt her out lint her out

as to that said the herb-doctor calmly much
may be said

say it then ruffling all his hairs you can't
sir can't then as in apostrophe look you nature
i don't deny but your clover is sweet and your
dandelions don't roar but whose hailstones smashed
my windows

sir with unimpaired affability producing one of
his boxes i am pained to meet with one who holds
nature a dangerous character though your manner is
refined your voice is rough in short you seem to have
a sore throat in the calumniated name of nature i
present you with this box my venerable friend here
has a similar one but to you a free gift sir through
her regularly-authorized agents of whom i happen to




be one nature delights in benefiting those who most
abuse her pray take it

away with it don't hold it so near ten to one
there is a torpedo in it such things have been editors
been killed that way take it further off i
say

good heavens my dear sir   

i tell you i want none of your boxes snapping his
rifle

oh take it   ugh ugh do take it chimed in the
old miser i wish he would give me one for nothing

you find it lonely eh turning short round gulled
yourself you would have a companion

how can he find it lonely returned the herb-doctor
or how desire a companion when here i stand by
him i even i in whom he has trust for the gulling
tell me is it humane to talk so to this poor old man
granting that his dependence on my medicine is vain
is it kind to deprive him of what in mere imagination
if nothing more may help eke out with hope his
disease for you if you have no confidence and
thanks to your native health can get along without it
so far at least as trusting in my medicine goes yet
how cruel an argument to use with this afflicted one
here is it not for all the world as if some brawny
pugilist aglow in december should rush in and put
out a hospital-fire because forsooth he feeling no need
of artificial heat the shivering patients shall have none
put it to your conscience sir and you will admit that
whatever be the nature of this afflicted one's trust you




in opposing it evince either an erring head or a heart
amiss come own are you not pitiless

yes poor soul said the missourian gravely eying
the old man   yes it is pitiless in one like me to
speak too honestly to one like you you are a late
sitter-up in this life past man's usual bed-time and
truth though with some it makes a wholesome breakfast
proves to all a supper too hearty hearty food
taken late gives bad dreams

what in wonder's name   ugh ugh   is he talking
about asked the old miser looking up to the herb-doctor

heaven be praised for that cried the missourian

out of his mind ain't he again appealed the old
miser

pray sir said the herb-doctor to the missourian
for what were you giving thanks just now

for this that with some minds truth is in effect
not so cruel a thing after all seeing that like a loaded
pistol found by poor devils of savages it raises
more wonder than terror   its peculiar virtue being unguessed
unless indeed by indiscreet handling it should
happen to go off of itself

i pretend not to divine your meaning there said
the herb-doctor after a pause during which he eyed the
missourian with a kind of pinched expression mixed of
pain and curiosity as if he grieved at his state of mind
and at the same time wondered what had brought him
to it but this much i know he added that the
general cast of your thoughts is to say the least




unfortunate there is strength in them but a strength
whose source being physical must wither you will
yet recant

recant

yes when as with this old man your evil days of
decay come on when a hoary captive in your chamber
then will you something like the dungeoned italian we
read of gladly seek the breast of that confidence begot in
the tender time of your youth blessed beyond telling
if it return to you in age

go back to nurse again eh second childhood
indeed you are soft

mercy mercy cried the old miser what is all
this   ugh ugh do talk sense my good friends
ain't you to the missourian going to buy some of
that medicine

pray my venerable friend said the herb-doctor
now trying to straighten himself don't lean quite so
hard my arm grows numb abate a little just a very
little

go said the missourian go lay down in your
grave old man if you can't stand of yourself it's a
hard world for a leaner

as to his grave said the herb-doctor that is far
enough off so he but faithfully take my medicine

ugh ugh ugh   he says true no i ain't   ugh
a going to die yet   ugh ugh ugh many years to live
yet ugh ugh ugh

i approve your confidence said the herb-doctor
but your coughing distresses me besides being




injurious to you pray let me conduct you to your
berth you are best there our friend here will wait
till my return i know

with which he led the old miser away and then
coming back the talk with the missourian was
resumed

sir said the herb-doctor with some dignity and
more feeling now that our infirm friend is withdrawn
allow me to the full to express my concern at the
words you allowed to escape you in his hearing some
of those words if i err not besides being calculated to
beget deplorable distrust in the patient seemed fitted to
convey unpleasant imputations against me his physician

suppose they did with a menacing air

why then   then indeed respectfully retreating
i fall back upon my previous theory of your general
facetiousness i have the fortune to be in company with
a humorist   a wag

fall back you had better and wag it is cried the
missourian following him up and wagging his raccoon
tail almost into the herb-doctor's face look you

at what

at this coon can you the fox catch him

if you mean returned the other not unselfpossessed
whether i flatter myself that i can in any way
dupe you or impose upon you or pass myself off upon
you for what i am not i as an honest man answer that
i have neither the inclination nor the power to do aught
of the kind




honest man seems to me you talk more like a
craven

you in vain seek to pick a quarrel with me or put
any affront upon me the innocence in me heals me

a healing like your own nostrums but you are a
queer man   a very queer and dubious man upon the
whole about the most so i ever met

the scrutiny accompanying this seemed unwelcome
to the diffidence of the herb-doctor as if at once to
attest the absence of resentment as well as to change
the subject he threw a kind of familiar cordiality into
his air and said so you are going to get some machine
made to do your work philanthropic scruples
doubtless forbid your going as far as new orleans for
slaves

slaves morose again in a twinkling won't have
em bad enough to see whites ducking and grinning
round for a favor without having those poor devils of
niggers congeeing round for their corn though to me
the niggers are the freer of the two you are an abolitionist
ain't you he added squaring himself with
both hands on his rifle used for a staff and gazing in
the herb-doctor's face with no more reverence than if it
were a target you are an abolitionist ain't you

as to that i cannot so readily answer if by abolitionist
you mean a zealot i am none but if you mean
a man who being a man feels for all men slaves included
and by any lawful act opposed to nobody's
interest and therefore rousing nobody's enmity would
willingly abolish suffering supposing it in its degree




to exist from among mankind irrespective of color
then am i what you say

picked and prudent sentiments you are the moderate
man the invaluable understrapper of the wicked
man you the moderate man may be used for wrong
but are useless for right

from all this said the herb-doctor still forgivingly
i infer that you a missourian though living in a slave-state
are without slave sentiments

aye but are you is not that air of yours so
spiritlessly enduring and yielding the very air of a
slave who is your master pray or are you owned by
a company

 my master

aye for come from maine or georgia you come
from a slave-state and a slave-pen where the best
breeds are to be bought up at any price from a livelihood
to the presidency abolitionism ye gods but
expresses the fellow-feeling of slave for slave

the back-woods would seem to have given you
rather eccentric notions now with polite superiority
smiled the herb-doctor still with manly intrepidity forbearing
each unmanly thrust but to return since
for your purpose you will have neither man nor boy
bond nor free truly then some sort of machine for you
is all there is left my desires for your success attend
you sir   ah glancing shoreward here is cape giradeau
i must leave you






in the polite spirit of the tusculan disputations


   philosophical intelligence office   novel
idea but how did you come to dream that i wanted
anything in your absurd line eh

about twenty minutes after leaving cape giradeau
the above was growled out over his shoulder by the missourian
to a chance stranger who had just accosted
him a round-backed baker-kneed man in a mean five-dollar
suit wearing collar-wise by a chain a small brass
plate inscribed p i o and who with a sort of canine
deprecation slunk obliquely behind

how did you come to dream that i wanted anything
in your line eh

oh respected sir whined the other crouching a
pace nearer and in his obsequiousness seeming to wag
his very coat-tails behind him shabby though they were
oh sir from long experience one glance tells me the
gentleman who is in need of our humble services

but suppose i did want a boy   what they jocosely
call a good boy   how could your absurd office help me   
philosophical intelligence office




yes respected sir an office founded on strictly philosophical
and physio   

look you   come up here   how by philosophy or
physiology either make good boys to order come up
here don't give me a crick in the neck come up
here come sir come calling as if to his pointer
tell me how put the requisite assortment of good
qualities into a boy as the assorted mince into the
pie

respected sir our office   

you talk much of that office where is it on
board this boat

oh no sir i just came aboard our office   

came aboard at that last landing eh pray do
you know a herb-doctor there smooth scamp in a
snuff-colored surtout

oh sir i was but a sojourner at cape giradeau
though now that you mention a snuff-colored surtout i
think i met such a man as you speak of stepping ashore
as i stepped aboard and pears to me i have seen him
somewhere before looks like a very mild christian
sort of person i should say do you know him respected
sir

not much but better than you seem to proceed
with your business

with a low shabby bow as grateful for the permission
the other began our office   

look you broke in the bachelor with ire have
you the spinal complaint what are you ducking and
groveling about keep still where's your office




the branch one which i represent is at alton sir
in the free state we now pass pointing somewhat
proudly ashore

free eh you a freeman you flatter yourself
with those coat-tails and that spinal complaint of servility
free just cast up in your private mind who
is your master will you

oh oh oh i don't understand   indeed   indeed
but respected sir as before said our office founded on
principles wholly new   

to the devil with your principles bad sign when
a man begins to talk of his principles hold come
back sir back here back sir back i tell you no
more boys for me nay i'm a mede and persian in
my old home in the woods i'm pestered enough with
squirrels weasels chipmunks skunks i want no more
wild vermin to spoil my temper and waste my substance
don't talk of boys enough of your boys a
plague of your boys chilblains on your boys as for
intelligence offices i've lived in the east and know
em swindling concerns kept by low-born cynics under
a fawning exterior wreaking their cynic malice upon
mankind you are a fair specimen of em

oh dear dear dear

dear yes a thrice dear purchase one of your
boys would be to me a rot on your boys

but respected sir if you will not have boys might
we not in our small way accommodate you with a
man

accommodate pray no doubt you could




accommodate me with a bosom-friend too couldn't you
accommodate obliging word accommodate there's
accommodation notes now where one accommodates
another with a loan and if he don't pay it pretty quickly
acommodates him with a chain to his foot accommodate
god forbid that i should ever be accommodated
no no look you as i told that cousin-german of
yours the herb-doctor i'm now on the road to get me
made some sort of machine to do my work machines for
me my cider-mill   does that ever steal my cider my
mowing-machine   does that ever lay a-bed mornings
my corn-husker   does that ever give me insolence
no cider-mill mowing-machine corn-husker   all faithfully
attend to their business disinterested too no
board no wages yet doing good all their lives long
shining examples that virtue is its own reward   the only
practical christians i know

oh dear dear dear dear

yes sir   boys start my soul-bolts what a difference
in a moral point of view between a corn-husker
and a boy sir a corn-husker for its patient continuance
in well-doing might not unfitly go to heaven do
you suppose a boy will

a corn-husker in heaven turning up the whites
of his eyes respected sir this way of talking as if
heaven were a kind of washington patent-office museum   
oh oh oh   as if mere machine-work and puppet-work
went to heaven   oh oh oh things incapable
of free agency to receive the eternal reward of well-doing   
oh oh oh




you praise-god-barebones you what are you groaning
about did i say anything of that sort seems to
me though you talk so good you are mighty quick at a
hint the other way or else you want to pick a polemic
quarrel with me

it may be so or not respected sir was now the demure
reply but if it be it is only because as a soldier
out of honor is quick in taking affront so a christian
out of religion is quick sometimes perhaps a little too
much so in spying heresy

well after an astonished pause for an unaccountable
pair you and the herb-doctor ought to yoke
together

so saying the bachelor was eying him rather sharply
when he with the brass plate recalled him to the discussion
by a hint not unflattering that he the man with
the brass plate was all anxiety to hear him further on
the subject of servants

about that matter exclaimed the impulsive bachelor
going off at the hint like a rocket all thinking
minds are now-a-days coming to the conclusion   one
derived from an immense hereditary experience   see
what horace and others of the ancients say of servants   
coming to the conclusion i say that boy or man the
human animal is for most work-purposes a losing animal
can't be trusted less trustworthy than oxen
for conscientiousness a turn-spit dog excels him hence
these thousand new inventions   carding machines horseshoe
machines tunnel-boring machines reaping machines
apple-paring machines boot-blacking machines




sewing machines shaving machines run-of-errand machines
dumb-waiter machines and the lord-only-knows-what
machines all of which announce the era when
that refractory animal the working or serving man
shall be a buried by-gone a superseded fossil shortly
prior to which glorious time i doubt not that a price
will be put upon their peltries as upon the knavish
possums especially the boys yes sir ringing his
rifle down on the deck i rejoice to think that the
day is at hand when prompted to it by law i shall
shoulder this gun and go out a boy-shooting

oh now lord lord lord   but our office respected
sir conducted as i ventured to observe   

no sir bristlingly settling his stubble chin in his
coon-skins don't try to oil me the herb-doctor
tried that my experience carried now through a course   
worse than salivation   a course of five and thirty
boys proves to me that boyhood is a natural state of
rascality

save us save us

yes sir yes my name is pitch i stick to what i
say i speak from fifteen years experience five and
thirty boys american irish english german african
mulatto not to speak of that china boy sent me by
one who well knew my perplexities from california
and that lascar boy from bombay thug i found
him sucking the embryo life from my spring eggs all
rascals sir every soul of them caucasian or mongol
amazing the endless variety of rascality in human nature
of the juvenile sort i remember that having




discharged one after another twenty-nine boys   each too
for some wholly unforeseen species of viciousness peculiar
to that one peculiar boy   i remember saying to myself
now then surely i have got to the end of the list
wholly exhausted it i have only now to get me a boy
any boy different from those twenty-nine preceding
boys and he infallibly shall be that virtuous boy i have
so long been seeking but bless me this thirtieth boy   
by the way having at the time long forsworn your intelligence
offices i had him sent to me from the commissioners
of emigration all the way from new york
culled out carefully in fine at my particular request
from a standing army of eight hundred boys the
flowers of all nations so they wrote me temporarily in
barracks on an east river island   i say this thirtieth
boy was in person not ungraceful his deceased mother
a lady's maid or something of that sort and
in manner why in a plebeian way a perfect chesterfield
very intelligent too   quick as a flash but
such suavity please sir please sir always bowing
and saying please sir in the strangest way too combining
a filial affection with a menial respect took
such warm singular interest in my affairs wanted to
be considered one of the family   sort of adopted son of
mine i suppose of a morning when i would go out
to my stable with what childlike good nature he would
trot out my nag please sir i think he's getting fatter
and fatter but he don't look very clean does
he unwilling to be downright harsh with so affectionate
a lad and he seems a little hollow inside the




haunch there don't he or no perhaps i don't see plain
this morning oh please sir it's just there i think
he's gaining so please polite scamp i soon found
he never gave that wretched nag his oats of nights
didn't bed him either was above that sort of chambermaid
work no end to his willful neglects but the
more he abused my service the more polite he grew

oh sir some way you mistook him

not a bit of it besides sir he was a boy who under
a chesterfieldian exterior hid strong destructive propensities
he cut up my horse-blanket for the bits of
leather for hinges to his chest denied it point-blank
after he was gone found the shreds under his mattress
would slyly break his hoe-handle too on purpose to
get rid of hoeing then be so gracefully penitent for
his fatal excess of industrious strength offer to mend
all by taking a nice stroll to the nighest settlement   
cherry-trees in full bearing all the way   to get the broken
thing cobbled very politely stole my pears odd
pennies shillings dollars and nuts regular squirrel at
it but i could prove nothing expressed to him my
suspicions said i moderately enough a little less
politeness and a little more honesty would suit me better
 he fired up threatened to sue for libel i won't
say anything about his afterwards in ohio being found
in the act of gracefully putting a bar across a rail-road
track for the reason that a stoker called him the rogue
that he was but enough polite boys or saucy boys
white boys or black boys smart boys or lazy boys
caucasian boys or mongol boys   all are rascals




shocking shocking nervously tucking his frayed
cravat-end out of sight surely respected sir you labor
under a deplorable hallucination why pardon again
you seem to have not the slightest confidence in boys i
admit indeed that boys some of them at least are but
too prone to one little foolish foible or other but what
then respected sir when by natural laws they finally
outgrow such things and wholly

having until now vented himself mostly in plaintive
dissent of canine whines and groans the man with the
brass-plate seemed beginning to summon courage to a
less timid encounter but upon his maiden essay was
not very encouragingly handled since the dialogue immediately
continued as follows

boys outgrow what is amiss in them from bad
boys spring good men sir the child is father of the
man hence as all boys are rascals so are all men
but god bless me you must know these things better
than i keeping an intelligence office as you do a business
which must furnish peculiar facilities for studying
mankind come come up here sir confess you know
these things pretty well after all do you not know
that all men are rascals and all boys too

sir replied the other spite of his shocked feelings
seeming to pluck up some spirit but not to an indiscreet
degree sir heaven be praised i am far very far from
knowing what you say true he thoughtfully continued
with my associates i keep an intelligence
office and for ten years come october have one way
or other been concerned in that line for no small




period in the great city of cincinnati too and though as
you hint within that long interval i must have had
more or less favorable opportunity for studying mankind   
in a business way scanning not only the faces
but ransacking the lives of several thousands of human
beings male and female of various nations both employers
and employed genteel and ungenteel educated
and uneducated yet   of course i candidly admit with
some random exceptions i have so far as my small observation
goes found that mankind thus domestically
viewed confidentially viewed i may say they upon the
whole   making some reasonable allowances for human
imperfection   present as pure a moral spectacle as the
purest angel could wish i say it respected sir with
confidence

gammon you don't mean what you say else
you are like a landsman at sea don't know the ropes
the very things everlastingly pulled before your eyes
serpent-like they glide about traveling blocks too
subtle for you in short the entire ship is a riddle
why you green ones wouldn't know if she were unseaworthy
but still with thumbs stuck back into your
arm-holes pace the rotten planks singing like a fool
words put into your green mouth by the cunning owner
the man who heavily insuring it sends his ship to be
wrecked   

a wet sheet and a flowing sea   
and sir now that it occurs to me your talk the
whole of it is but a wet sheet and a flowing sea and




an idle wind that follows fast offering a striking contrast
to my own discourse

sir exclaimed the man with the brass-plate his
patience now more or less tasked permit me with
deference to hint that some of your remarks are injudiciously
worded and thus we say to our patrons when
they enter our office full of abuse of us because of some
worthy boy we may have sent them   some boy wholly
misjudged for the time yes sir permit me to remark
that you do not sufficiently consider that though a small
man i may have my small share of feelings

well well i didn't mean to wound your feelings at
all and that they are small very small i take your
word for it sorry sorry but truth is like a thrashing-machine
tender sensibilities must keep out of the
way hope you understand me don't want to hurt
you all i say is what i said in the first place only
now i swear it that all boys are rascals

sir lowly replied the other still forbearing like an
old lawyer badgered in court or else like a good-hearted
simpleton the butt of mischievous wags sir since
you come back to the point will you allow me in my
small quiet way to submit to you certain small quiet
views of the subject in hand

oh yes with insulting indifference rubbing his
chin and looking the other way oh yes go on

well then respected sir continued the other now
assuming as genteel an attitude as the irritating set of
his pinched five-dollar suit would permit well then
sir the peculiar principles the strictly philosophical




principles i may say guardedly rising in dignity as
he guardedly rose on his toes upon which our office is
founded has led me and my associates in our small
quiet way to a careful analytical study of man conducted
too on a quiet theory and with an unobtrusive
aim wholly our own that theory i will not now at
large set forth but some of the discoveries resulting
from it i will by your permission very briefly mention
such of them i mean as refer to the state of boyhood
scientifically viewed

then you have studied the thing expressly studied
boys eh why didn't you out with that before

sir in my small business way i have not conversed
with so many masters gentlemen masters for nothing
i have been taught that in this world there is a precedence
of opinions as well as of persons you have
kindly given me your views i am now with modesty
about to give you mine

stop flunkying   go on

in the first place sir our theory teaches us to proceed
by analogy from the physical to the moral are
we right there sir now sir take a young boy a
young male infant rather a man-child in short   what
sir i respectfully ask do you in the first place remark

a rascal sir present and prospective a rascal

sir if passion is to invade surely science must
evacuate may i proceed well then what in the
first place in a general view do you remark respected
sir in that male baby or man-child

the bachelor privily growled but this time upon the




whole better governed himself than before though not
indeed to the degree of thinking it prudent to risk an
articulate response

what do you remark i respectfully repeat
but as no answer came only the low half-suppressed
growl as of bruin in a hollow trunk the questioner continued
well sir if you will permitme in my small way
to speak for you you remark respected sir an incipient
creation loose sort of sketchy thing a little preliminary
rag-paper study or careless cartoon so to speak of a
man the idea you see respected sir is there but as
yet wants filling out in a word respected sir the
man-child is at present but little every way i don't
pretend to deny it but then he promises well does he
not yes promises very well indeed i may say so
too we say to our patrons in reference to some noble
little youngster objected to for being a dwarf but to
advance one step further extending his thread-bare leg
as he drew a pace nearer we must now drop the
figure of the rag-paper cartoon and borrow one   to use
presently when wanted   from the horticultural kingdom
some bud lily-bud if you please now such
points as the new-born man-child has   as yet not all
that could be desired i am free to confess   still such
as they are there they are and palpable as those of an
adult but we stop not here taking another step
the man-child not only possesses these present points
small though they are but likewise   now our horticultural
image comes into play   like the bud of the lily
he contains concealed rudiments of others that is




points at present invisible with beauties at present
dormant

come come this talk is getting too horticultural
and beautiful altogether cut it short cut it short

respected sir with a rustily martial sort of gesture
like a decayed corporal's when deploying into the
field of discourse the vanguard of an important argument
much more in evolving the grand central forces
of a new philosophy of boys as i may say surely you
will kindly allow scope adequate to the movement in
hand small and humble in its way as that movement
may be is it worth my while to go on respected
sir

yes stop flunkying and go on

thus encouraged again the philosopher with the brass-plate
proceeded

supposing sir that worthy gentleman in such
terms to an applicant for service we allude to some
patron we chance to have in our eye supposing respected
sir that worthy gentleman adam to have been
dropped overnight in eden as a calf in the pasture
supposing that sir   then how could even the learned
serpent himself have foreknown that such a downychinned
little innocent would eventually rival the goat
in a beard sir wise as the serpent was that eventuality
would have been entirely hidden from his wisdom

i don't know about that the devil is very sagacious
to judge by the event he appears to have
understood man better even than the being who made
him




for god's sake don't say that sir to the point
can it now with fairness be denied that in his beard the
man-child prospectively possesses an appendix not less
imposing than patriarchal and for this goodly beard
should we not by generous anticipation give the man-child
even in his cradle credit should we not now
sir respectfully i put it

yes if like pig-weed he mows it down soon as it
shoots porcinely rubbing his stubble-chin against his
coon-skins

i have hinted at the analogy continued the other
calmly disregardful of the digression now to apply it
suppose a boy evince no noble quality then generously
give him credit for his prospective one don't you
see so we say to our patrons when they would fain
return a boy upon us as unworthy madam or sir
as the case may be has this boy a beard no
has he we respectfully ask as yet evinced any noble
quality no indeed then madam or sir take him
back we humbly beseech and keep him till that same
noble quality sprouts for have confidence it like the
beard is in him

very fine theory scornfully exclaimed the bachelor
yet in secret perhaps not entirely undisturbed by
these strange new views of the matter but what trust
is to be placed in it

the trust of perfect confidence sir to proceed
once more if you please regard the man-child

hold paw-like thrusting out his bearskin arm
don't intrude that man-child upon me too often he




who loves not bread dotes not on dough as little of
your man-child as your logical arrangements will
admit

anew regard the man-child with inspired intrepidity
repeated he with the brass-plate in the perspective
of his developments i mean at first the man-child
has no teeth but about the sixth month   am i right
sir

don't know anything about it

to proceed then though at first deficient in teeth
about the sixth month the man-child begins to put forth
in that particular and sweet those tender little puttings-forth
are

very but blown out of his mouth directly worthless
enough

admitted and therefore we say to our patrons returning
with a boy alleged not only to be deficient in
goodness but redundant in ill the lad madam or sir
evinces very corrupt qualities does he no end to
them but have confidence there will be for pray
madam in this lad's early childhood were not those
frail first teeth then his followed by his present sound
even beautiful and permanent set and the more objectionable
those first teeth became was not that madam
we respectfully submit so much the more reason
to look for their speedy substitution by the present
sound even beautiful and permanent ones true
true can't deny that then madam take him back
we respectfully beg and wait till in the now swift
course of nature dropping those transient moral




blemishes you complain of he replacingly buds forth in the
sound even beautiful and permanent virtues

very philosophical again was the contemptuous
reply   the outward contempt perhaps proportioned to
the inward misgiving vastly philosophical indeed but
tell me   to continue your analogy   since the second
teeth followed   in fact came from   the first is there
no chance the blemish may be transmitted

not at all abating in humility as he gained in
the argument the second teeth follow but do not
come from the first successors not sons the first
teeth are not like the germ blossom of the apple at
once the father of and incorporated into the growth it
foreruns but they are thrust from their place by the
independent undergrowth of the succeeding set   an
illustration by the way which shows more for me than
i meant though not more than i wish

what does it show surly-looking as a thundercloud
with the inkept unrest of unacknowledged conviction

it shows this respected sir that in the case of any
boy especially an ill one to apply unconditionally the
saying that the child is father of the man is besides
implying an uncharitable aspersion of the race affirming
a thing very wide of   

   your analogy like a snapping turtle

yes respected sir

but is analogy argument you are a punster

punster respected sir with a look of being aggrieved




yes you pun with ideas as another man may with
words

oh well sir whoever talks in that strain whoever
has no confidence in human reason whoever despises
human reason in vain to reason with him still respected
sir altering his air permit me to hint that
had not the force of analogy moved you somewhat you
would hardly have offered to contemn it

talk away disdainfully but pray tell me what
has that last analogy of yours to do with your intelligence
office business

everything to do with it respected sir from that
analogy we derive the reply made to such a patron as
shortly after being supplied by us with an adult servant
proposes to return him upon our hands not that while
with the patron said adult has given any cause of dissatisfaction
but the patron has just chanced to hear
something unfavorable concerning him from some
gentleman who employed said adult long before while
a boy to which too fastidious patron we taking said
adult by the hand and graciously reintroducing him to
the patron say far be it from you madam or sir
to proceed in your censure against this adult in anything
of the spirit of an ex-post-facto law madam or
sir would you visit upon the butterfly the sins of the
caterpillar in the natural advance of all creatures do
they not bury themselves over and over again in the
endless resurrection of better and better madam or sir
take back this adult he may have been a caterpillar
but is now a butterfly




pun away but even accepting your analogical pun
what does it amount to was the caterpillar one creature
and is the butterfly another the butterfly is the
caterpillar in a gaudy cloak stripped of which there
lies the impostor's long spindle of a body pretty much
worm-shaped as before

you reject the analogy to the facts then you
deny that a youth of one character can be transformed
into a man of an opposite character now then   yes
i have it there's the founder of la trappe and ignatius
loyola in boyhood and someway into manhood
both devil-may-care bloods and yet in the end the
wonders of the world for anchoritish self-command
these two examples by-the-way we cite to such patrons
as would hastily return rakish young waiters upon
us madam or sir   patience patience we say good
madam or sir would you discharge forth your cask of
good wine because while working it riles more or less
then discharge not forth this young waiter the good in
him is working but he is a sad rake therein is
his promise the rake being crude material for the
saint

ah you are a talking man   what i call a wordy
man you talk talk

and with submission sir what is the greatest judge
bishop or prophet but a talking man he talks talks
it is the peculiar vocation of a teacher to talk what's
wisdom itself but table-talk the best wisdom in this
world and the last spoken by its teacher did it not
literally and truly come in the form of table-talk




you you you rattling down his rifle

to shift the subject since we cannot agree pray
what is your opinion respected sir of st augustine

st augustine what should i or you either know
of him seems to me for one in such a business to say
nothing of such a coat that though you don't know a
great deal indeed yet you know a good deal more than
you ought to know or than you have a right to know
or than it is safe or expedient for you to know or
than in the fair course of life you could have honestly
come to know i am of opinion you should be served
like a jew in the middle ages with his gold this knowledge
of yours which you haven't enough knowledge to
know how to make a right use of it should be taken
from you and so i have been thinking all along

you are merry sir but you have a little looked
into st augustine i suppose

st augustine on original sin is my text book
but you i ask again where do you find time or inclination
for these out-of-the-way speculations in fact
your whole talk the more i think of it is altogether unexampled
and extraordinary

respected sir have i not already informed you that
the quite new method the strictly philosophical one on
which our office is founded has led me and my associates
to an enlarged study of mankind it was my fault
if i did not likewise hint that these studies directed
always to the scientific procuring of good servants of all
sorts boys included for the kind gentlemen our patrons




   that these studies i say have been conducted equally
among all books of all libraries as among all men of all
nations then you rather like st augustine sir

excellent genius

in some points he was yet how comes it that under
his own hand st augustine confesses that until his
thirtieth year he was a very sad dog

a saint a sad dog

not the saint but the saint's irresponsible little
forerunner   the boy

all boys are rascals and so are all men again flying
off at his tangent my name is pitch i stick to
what i say

ah sir permit me   when i behold you on this mild
summer's eve thus eccentrically clothed in the skins of
wild beasts i cannot but conclude that the equally
grim and unsuitable habit of your mind is likewise but
an eccentric assumption having no basis in your genuine
soul no more than in nature herself

well really now   really fidgeted the bachelor
not unaffected in his conscience by these benign personalities
really really now i don't know but that i
may have been a little bit too hard upon those five and
thirty boys of mine

glad to find you a little softening sir who knows
now but that flexile gracefulness however questionable
at the time of that thirtieth boy of yours might have
been the silky husk of the most solid qualities of maturity
it might have been with him as with the ear of the
indian corn




yes yes yes excitedly cried the bachelor as the
light of this new illustration broke in yes yes and
now that i think of it how often i've sadly watched my
indian corn in may wondering whether such sickly
half-eaten sprouts could ever thrive up into the stiff
stately spear of august

a most admirable reflection sir and you have only
according to the analogical theory first started by our office
to apply it to that thirtieth boy in question and see
the result had you but kept that thirtieth boy   been
patient with his sickly virtues cultivated them hoed
round them why what a glorious guerdon would have
been yours when at last you should have had a st augustine
for an ostler

really really   well i am glad i didn't send him to
jail as at first i intended

oh that would have been too bad grant he was
vicious the petty vices of boys are like the innocent
kicks of colts as yet imperfectly broken some boys
know not virtue only for the same reason they know
not french it was never taught them established upon
the basis of parental charity juvenile asylums exist by
law for the benefit of lads convicted of acts which in
adults would have received other requital why because
do what they will society like our office at bottom
has a christian confidence in boys and all this we
say to our patrons

your patrons sir seem your marines to whom you
may say anything said the other relapsing why
do knowing employers shun youths from asylums




though offered them at the smallest wages i'll none
of your reformado boys

such a boy respected sir i would not get for you
but a boy that never needed reform do not smile for
as whooping-cough and measles are juvenile diseases
and yet some juveniles never have them so are there
boys equally free from juvenile vices true for the
best of boys measles may be contagious and evil communications
corrupt good manners but a boy with a
sound mind in a sound body   such is the boy i would
get you if hitherto sir you have struck upon a peculiarly
bad vein of boys so much the more hope now of
your hitting a good one

that sounds a kind of reasonable as it were   a
little so really in fact though you have said a great
many foolish things very foolish and absurd things yet
upon the whole your conversation has been such as
might almost lead one less distrustful than i to repose a
certain conditional confidence in you i had almost added
in your office also now for the humor of it supposing
that even i i myself really had this sort of conditional
confidence though but a grain what sort of a boy in
sober fact could you send me and what would be
your fee

conducted replied the other somewhat loftily
rising now in eloquence as his proselyte for all his pretenses
sunk in conviction conducted upon principles
involving care learning and labor exceeding what is
usual in kindred institutions the philosophical intelligence
office is forced to charges somewhat higher than




customary briefly our fee is three dollars in advance
as for the boy by a lucky chance i have a very promising
little fellow now in my eye   a very likely little
fellow indeed

honest

as the day is long might trust him with untold
millions such at least were the marginal observations
on the phrenological chart of his head submitted to me
by the mother

how old

just fifteen

tall stout

uncommonly so for his age his mother remarked

industrious

the busy bee

the bachelor fell into a troubled reverie at last
with much hesitancy he spoke

do you think now candidly that   i say candidly   
candidly   could i have some small limited   some
faint conditional degree of confidence in that boy
candidly now

candidly you could

a sound boy a good boy

never knew one more so

the bachelor fell into another irresolute reverie
then said well now you have suggested some
rather new views of boys and men too upon those
views in the concrete i at present decline to determine
nevertheless for the sake purely of a scientific experiment
i will try that boy i don't think him an angel




mind no no but i'll try him there are my three
dollars and here is my address send him along this
day two weeks hold you will be wanting the money
for his passage there handing it somewhat reluctantly

ah thank you i had forgotten his passage then
altering in manner and gravely holding the bills continued
respected sir never willingly do i handle
money not with perfect willingness nay with a certain
alacrity paid either tell me that you have a perfect
and unquestioning confidence in me never mind the boy
now or permit me respectfully to return these bills

put em up put em up

thank you confidence is the indispensable basis
of all sorts of business transactions without it commerce
between man and man as between country and
country would like a watch run down and stop and
now supposing that against present expectation the lad
should after all evince some little undesirable trait do
not respected sir rashly dismiss him have but patience
have but confidence those transient vices will
ere long fall out and be replaced by the sound firm
even and permanent virtues ah glancing shoreward
towards a grotesquely-shaped bluff there's the devil's
joke as they call it the bell for landing will shortly
ring i must go look up the cook i brought for the innkeeper
at cairo






in which the powerful effect of natural scenery is evinced
in the case of the missourian who in view of the region roundabout
cairo has a return of his chilly fit


at cairo the old established firm of fever ague is
still settling up its unfinished business that creole
grave-digger yellow jack   his hand at the mattock and
spade has not lost its cunning while don saturninus
typhus taking his constitutional with death calvin edson
and three undertakers in the morass snuffs up the
mephitic breeze with zest

in the dank twilight fanned with mosquitoes and
sparkling with fire-flies the boat now lies before cairo
she has landed certain passengers and tarries for the
coming of expected ones leaning over the rail on the
inshore side the missourian eyes through the dubious
medium that swampy and squalid domain and over it
audibly mumbles his cynical mind to himself as apemantus
dog may have mumbled his bone he bethinks
him that the man with the brass-plate was to land on
this villainous bank and for that cause if no other begins
to suspect him like one beginning to rouse himself
from a dose of chloroform treacherously given he




half divines too that he the philosopher had unwittingly
been betrayed into being an unphilosophical dupe
to what vicissitudes of light and shade is man subject
he ponders the mystery of human subjectivity in general
he thinks he perceives with crossbones his favorite
author that as one may wake up well in the morning
very well indeed and brisk as a buck i thank you but
ere bed-time get under the weather there is no telling
how   so one may wake up wise and slow of assent
very wise and very slow i assure you and for all that
before night by like trick in the atmosphere be left in
the lurch a ninny health and wisdom equally precious
and equally little as unfluctuating possessions to be relied
on

but where was slipped in the entering wedge philosophy
knowledge experience   were those trusty knights
of the castle recreant no but unbeknown to them the
enemy stole on the castle's south side its genial one
where suspicion the warder parleyed in fine his too
indulgent too artless and companionable nature betrayed
him admonished by which he thinks he must be a
little splenetic in his intercourse henceforth

he revolves the crafty process of sociable chat by
which as he fancies the man with the brass-plate
wormed into him and made such a fool of him as insensibly
to persuade him to waive in his exceptional
case that general law of distrust systematically applied
to the race he revolves but cannot comprehend the
operation still less the operator was the man a
trickster it must be more for the love than the lucre




two or three dirty dollars the motive to so many nice
wiles and yet how full of mean needs his seeming
before his mental vision the person of that threadbare
talleyrand that impoverished machiavelli that seedy
rosicrucian   for something of all these he vaguely deems
him   passes now in puzzled review fain in his disfavor
would he make out a logical case the doctrine
of analogies recurs fallacious enough doctrine when
wielded against one's prejudices but in corroboration of
cherished suspicions not without likelihood analogically
he couples the slanting cut of the equivocator's
coat-tails with the sinister cast in his eye he weighs
slyboot's sleek speech in the light imparted by the oblique
import of the smooth slope of his worn boot-heels
the insinuator's undulating flunkyisms dovetail into
those of the flunky beast that windeth his way on his
belly

from these uncordial reveries he is roused by a cordial
slap on the shoulder accompanied by a spicy volume of
tobacco-smoke out of which came a voice sweet as a
seraph's

a penny for your thoughts my fine fellow






a philanthropist undertakes to convert a misanthrope but does
not get beyond confuting him


 hands off cried the bachelor involuntarily covering
dejection with moroseness

hands off that sort of label won't do in our fair
whoever in our fair has fine feelings loves to feel the
nap of fine cloth especially when a fine fellow wears
it

and who of my fine-fellow species may you be
from the brazils ain't you toucan fowl fine feathers
on foul meat

this ungentle mention of the toucan was not improbably
suggested by the parti-hued and rather plumagy
aspect of the stranger no bigot it would seem but a
liberalist in dress and whose wardrobe almost anywhere
than on the liberal mississippi used to all sorts of fantastic
informalities might even to observers less critical
than the bachelor have looked if anything a little out
of the common but not more so perhaps than considering
the bear and raccoon costume the bachelor's
own appearance in short the stranger sported a vesture
barred with various hues that of the cochineal




predominating in style participating of a highland
plaid emir's robe and french blouse from its plaited
sort of front peeped glimpses of a flowered regatta-shirt
while for the rest white trowsers of ample duck flowed
over maroon-colored slippers and a jaunty smoking-cap
of regal purple crowned him off at top king of traveled
good-fellows evidently grotesque as all was nothing
looked stiff or unused all showed signs of easy service
the least wonted thing setting like a wonted glove
that genial hand which had just been laid on the ungenial
shoulder was now carelessly thrust down before
him sailor-fashion into a sort of indian belt confining
the redundant vesture the other held by its long bright
cherry-stem a nuremburgh pipe in blast its great porcelain
bowl painted in miniature with linked crests and
arms of interlinked nations   a florid show as by
subtle saturations of its mellowing essence the tobacco
had ripened the bowl so it looked as if something similar
of the interior spirit came rosily out on the cheek but
rosy pipe-bowl or rosy countenance all was lost on
that unrosy man the bachelor who waiting a moment
till the commotion caused by the boat's renewed progress
had a little abated thus continued

hark ye jeeringly eying the cap and belt did
you ever see signor marzetti in the african pantomime

no   good performer

excellent plays the intelligent ape till he seems it
with such naturalness can a being endowed with an
immortal spirit enter into that of a monkey but




where's your tail in the pantomime marzetti no
hypocrite in his monkery prides himself on that

the stranger now at rest sideways and genially on
one hip his right leg cavalierly crossed before the other
the toe of his vertical slipper pointed easily down on the
deck whiffed out a long leisurely sort of indifferent and
charitable puff betokening him more or less of the mature
man of the world a character which like its opposite
the sincere christian's is not always swift to take
offense and then drawing near still smoking again
laid his hand this time with mild impressiveness on the
ursine shoulder and not unamiably said that in your
address there is a sufficiency of the fortiter in re few unbiased
observers will question but that this is duly
attempered with the suaviter in modo may admit i think
of an honest doubt my dear fellow beaming his eyes
full upon him what injury have i done you that
you should receive my greeting with a curtailed civility

off hands once more shaking the friendly member
from him who in the name of the great chimpanzee
in whose likeness you marzetti and the other chatterers
are made who in thunder are you

a cosmopolitan a catholic man who being such
ties himself to no narrow tailor or teacher but federates
in heart as in costume something of the various gallantries
of men under various suns oh one roams not
over the gallant globe in vain bred by it is a fraternal
and fusing feeling no man is a stranger you accost
anybody warm and confiding you wait not for




measured advances and though indeed mine in this instance
have met with no very hilarious encouragement
yet the principle of a true citizen of the world is still to
return good for ill   my dear fellow tell me how i can
serve you

by dispatching yourself mr popinjay-of-the-world
into the heart of the lunar mountains you are another
of them out of my sight

is the sight of humanity so very disagreeable to you
then ah i may be foolish but for my part in all its
aspects i love it served up  la pole or  la moor  la
ladrone or  la yankee that good dish man still delights
me or rather is man a wine i never weary of
comparing and sipping wherefore am i a pledged cosmopolitan
a sort of london-dock-vault connoisseur
going about from teheran to natchitoches a taster of
races in all his vintages smacking my lips over this racy
creature man continually but as there are teetotal
palates which have a distaste even for amontillado so i
suppose there may be teetotal souls which relish not
even the very best brands of humanity excuse me
but it just occurs to me that you my dear fellow possibly
lead a solitary life

solitary starting as at a touch of divination

yes in a solitary life one insensibly contracts oddities   
talking to one's self now

been eaves-dropping eh

why a soliloquist in a crowd can hardly but be
overheard and without much reproach to the hearer




you are an eaves-dropper

well be it so

confess yourself an eaves-dropper

i confess that when you were muttering here i passing
by caught a word or two and by like chance
something previous of your chat with the intelligence-office
man   a rather sensible fellow by the way
much of my style of thinking would for his own sake
he were of my style of dress grief to good minds to
see a man of superior sense forced to hide his light
under the bushel of an inferior coat   well from what
little i heard i said to myself here now is one with the
unprofitable philosophy of disesteem for man which
disease in the main i have observed   excuse me   to
spring from a certain lowness if not sourness of spirits
inseparable from sequestration trust me one had better
mix in and do like others sad business this holding
out against having a good time life is a pic-nic en
costume one must take a part assume a character stand
ready in a sensible way to play the fool to come in
plain clothes with a long face as a wiseacre only makes
one a discomfort to himself and a blot upon the scene
like your jug of cold water among the wine-flasks it
leaves you unelated among the elated ones no no
this austerity won't do let me tell you too   en confiance   
that while revelry may not always merge into
ebriety soberness in too deep potations may become a
sort of sottishness which sober sottishness in my
way of thinking is only to be cured by beginning at the
other end of the horn to tipple a little




pray what society of vintners and old topers are
you hired to lecture for

i fear i did not give my meaning clearly a little
story may help the story of the worthy old woman
of goshen a very moral old woman who wouldn't let
her shoats eat fattening apples in fall for fear the fruit
might ferment upon their brains and so make them
swinish now during a green christmas inauspicious
to the old this worthy old woman fell into a moping
decline took to her bed no appetite and refused to
see her best friends in much concern her good man
sent for the doctor who after seeing the patient and
putting a question or two beckoned the husband out
and said deacon do you want her cured indeed i
do go directly then and buy a jug of santa cruz
santa cruz my wife drink santa cruz either that
or die but how much as much as she can get
down but she'll get drunk that's the cure
wise men like doctors must be obeyed much against
the grain the sober deacon got the unsober medicine
and equally against her conscience the poor old woman
took it but by so doing ere long recovered health and
spirits famous appetite and glad again to see her
friends and having by this experience broken the ice of
arid abstinence never afterwards kept herself a cup too
low

this story had the effect of surprising the bachelor
into interest though hardly into approval

if i take your parable right said he sinking no
little of his former churlishness the meaning is that




one cannot enjoy life with gusto unless he renounce
the too-sober view of life but since the too-sober
view is doubtless nearer true than the too-drunken i
who rate truth though cold water above untruth though
tokay will stick to my earthen jug

i see slowly spirting upward a spiral staircase of
lazy smoke i see you go in for the lofty

how

oh nothing but if i wasn't afraid of prosing i
might tell another story about an old boot in a pieman's
loft contracting there between sun and oven an
unseemly dry-seasoned curl and warp you've seen such
leathery old garretteers haven't you very high sober
solitary philosophic grand old boots indeed but i for
my part would rather be the pieman's trodden slipper
on the ground talking of piemen humble-pie before
proud-cake for me this notion of being lone and lofty
is a sad mistake men i hold in this respect to be like
roosters the one that betakes himself to a lone and
lofty perch is the hen-pecked one or the one that has
the pip

you are abusive cried the bachelor evidently
touched

who is abused you or the race you won't
stand by and see the human race abused oh then
you have some respect for the human race

i have some respect for myself with a lip not so
firm as before

and what race may you belong to now don't you
see my dear fellow in what inconsistencies one involves




himself by affecting disesteem for men to a charm my
little stratagem succeeded come come think better
of it and as a first step to a new mind give up solitude
i fear by the way you have at some time been reading
zimmermann that old mr megrims of a zimmermann
whose book on solitude is as vain as hume's on suicide
as bacon's on knowledge and like these will betray
him who seeks to steer soul and body by it like a false
religion all they be they what boasted ones you
please who to the yearning of our kind after a founded
rule of content offer aught not in the spirit of fellowly
gladness based on due confidence in what is above
away with them for poor dupes or still poorer impostors

his manner here was so earnest that scarcely any
auditor perhaps but would have been more or less
impressed by it while possibly nervous opponents might
have a little quailed under it thinking within himself
a moment the bachelor replied had you experience
you would know that your tippling theory take it in
what sense you will is poor as any other and rabelais's
pro-wine koran no more trustworthy than mahomet's
anti-wine one

enough for a finality knocking the ashes from his
pipe we talk and keep talking and still stand where
we did what do you say for a walk my arm and
let's a turn they are to have dancing on the hurricanedeck
to-night i shall fling them off a scotch jig while to
save the pieces you hold my loose change and following
that i propose that you my dear fellow stack your




gun and throw your bearskins in a sailor's hornpipe   i
holding your watch what do you say

at this proposition the other was himself again all
raccoon

look you thumping down his rifle are you
jeremy diddler no 

jeremy diddler i have have heard of jeremy the
prophet and jeremy taylor the divine but your other
jeremy is a gentleman i am unacquainted with

you are his confidential clerk ain't you

 whose pray not that i think myself unworthy of
being confided in but i don't understand

you are another of them somehow i meet with
the most extraordinary metaphysical scamps to-day
sort of visitation of them and yet that herb-doctor
diddler somehow takes off the raw edge of the diddlers
that come after him

herb-doctor who is he

like you   another of them

 who then drawing near as if for a good long
explanatory chat his left hand spread and his pipe-stem
coming crosswise down upon it like a ferule you
think amiss of me now to undeceive you i will just
enter into a little argument and   

no you don't no more little arguments for me
had too many little arguments to-day

but put a case can you deny   i dare you to
deny   that the man leading a solitary life is peculiarly
exposed to the sorriest misconceptions touching strangers




yes i do deny it again in his impulsiveness snapping
at the controversial bait and i will confute
you there in a trice look you   

now now now my dear fellow thrusting out
both vertical palms for double shields you crowd me
too hard you don't give one a chance say what you
will to shun a social proposition like mine to shun
society in any way evinces a churlish nature   cold loveless
as to embrace it shows one warm and friendly
in fact sunshiny

here the other all agog again in his perverse way
launched forth into the unkindest references to deaf old
worldlings keeping in the deafening world and gouty
gluttons limping to their gouty gormandizings and
corseted coquets clasping their corseted cavaliers in the
waltz all for disinterested society's sake and thousands
bankrupt through lavishness ruining themselves out of
pure love of the sweet company of man   no envies
rivalries or other unhandsome motive to it

ah now deprecating with his pipe irony is so
unjust never could abide irony something satanic about
irony god defend me from irony and satire his bosom
friend

a right knave's prayer and a right fool's too snaping
his rifle-lock

now be frank own that was a little gratuitous
but no no you didn't mean it any way i can make
allowances ah did you but know it how much pleasanter
to puff at this philanthropic pipe than still to keep
fumbling at that misanthropic rifle as for your




worldlingg lutton and coquette though doubtless being
such they may have their little foibles   as who has
not   yet not one of the three can be reproached with
that awful sin of shunning society awful i call it for
not seldom it presupposes a still darker thing than
itself   remorse

remorse drives man away from man how came
your fellow-creature cain after the first murder to go
and build the first city and why is it that the
modern cain dreads nothing so much as solitary confinement

my dear fellow you get excited say what you
will i for one must have my fellow-creatures round me
thick too   i must have them thick

the pick-pocket too loves to have his fellow-creatures
round him tut man no one goes into the crowd
but for his end and the end of too many is the same as
the pick-pocket's   a purse

now my dear fellow how can you have the conscience
to say that when it is as much according to
natural law that men are social as sheep gregarious
but grant that in being social each man has his end
do you upon the strength of that do you yourself i
say mix with man now immediately and be your
end a more genial philosophy come let's take a
turn

again he offered his fraternal arm but the bachelor
once more flung it off and raising his rifle in energetic
invocation cried now the high-constable catch and
confound all knaves in towns and rats in grain-bins and




if in this boat which is a human grain-bin for the time
any sly smooth philandering rat be dodging now pin
him thou high rat-catcher against this rail

a noble burst shows you at heart a trump and
when a card's that little matters it whether it be spade
or diamond you are good wine that to be still better
only needs a shaking up come let's agree that we'll
to new orleans and there embark for london   i staying
with my friends nigh primrose-hill and you putting
up at the piazza covent garden   piazza covent garden
for tell me   since you will not be a disciple
to the full   tell me was not that humor of diogenes
which led him to live a merry-andrew in the flowermarket
better than that of the less wise athenian
which made him a skulking scare-crow in pine-barrens
an injudicious gentleman lord timon

your hand seizing it

bless me how cordial a squeeze it is agreed we
shall be brothers then

as much so as a brace of misanthropes can be
with another and terrific squeeze i had thought that
the moderns had degenerated beneath the capacity of
misanthropy rejoiced though but in one instance
and that disguised to be undeceived

the other stared in blank amaze

won't do you are diogenes diogenes in disguise
i say   diogenes masquerading as a cosmopolitan

with ruefully altered mien the stranger still stood mute
awhile at length in a pained tone spoke how hard
the lot of that pleader who in his zeal conceding too




much is taken to belong to a side which he but labors
however ineffectually to convert then with another
change of air to you an ishmael disguising
in sportiveness my intent i came ambassador from the
human race charged with the assurance that for your
mislike they bore no answering grudge but sought to
conciliate accord between you and them yet you take
me not for the honest envoy but i know not what sort
of unheard-of spy sir he less lowly added this
mistaking of your man should teach you how you may
mistake all men for god's sake laying both hands
upon him get you confidence see how distrust has
duped you i diogenes i he who going a step
beyond misanthropy was less a man-hater than a manhooter
better were i stark and stiff

with which the philanthropist moved away less
lightsome than he had come leaving the discomfited
misanthrope to the solitude he held so sapient






the cosmopolitan makes an acquaintance


in the act of retiring the cosmopolitan was met by a
passenger who with the bluff abord of the west thus
addressed him though a stranger

queer coon your friend had a little skrimmage
with him myself rather entertaining old coon if he
wasn't so deuced analytical reminded me somehow of
what i've heard about colonel john moredock of illinois
only your friend ain't quite so good a fellow at
bottom i should think

it was in the semicircular porch of a cabin opening
a recess from the deck lit by a zoned lamp swung overhead
and sending its light vertically down like the sun
at noon beneath the lamp stood the speaker affording
to any one disposed to it no unfavorable chance for
scrutiny but the glance now resting on him betrayed
no such rudeness

a man neither tall nor stout neither short nor gaunt
but with a body fitted as by measure to the service of
his mind for the rest one less favored perhaps in his
features than his clothes and of these the beauty may
have been less in the fit than the cut to say nothing of




the fineness of the nap seeming out of keeping with
something the reverse of fine in the skin and the unsuitableness
of a violet vest sending up sunset hues to
a countenance betokening a kind of bilious habit

but upon the whole it could not be fairly said that
his appearance was unprepossessing indeed to the congenial
it would have been doubtless not uncongenial
while to others it could not fail to be at least curiously
interesting from the warm air of florid cordiality contrasting
itself with one knows not what kind of aguish
sallowness of saving discretion lurking behind it ungracious
critics might have thought that the manner
flushed the man something in the same fictitious way
that the vest flushed the cheek and though his teeth
were singularly good those same ungracious ones might
have hinted that they were too good to be true or rather
were not so good as they might be since the best
false teeth are those made with at least two or three
blemishes the more to look like life but fortunately
for better constructions no such critics had the stranger
now in eye only the cosmopolitan who after in the
first place acknowledging his advances with a mute salute   
in which acknowledgment if there seemed less of
spirit than in his way of accosting the missourian it was
probably because of the saddening sequel of that late interview   
thus now replied colonel john moredock
repeating the words abstractedly that surname recalls
reminiscences pray with enlivened air was he
anyway connected with the moredocks of moredock
hall northamptonshire england




i know no more of the moredocks of moredock hall
than of the burdocks of burdock hut returned the
other with the air somehow of one whose fortunes had
been of his own making all i know is that the late
colonel john moredock was a famous one in his time
eye like lochiel's finger like a trigger nerve like a catamount's
and with but two little oddities   seldom stirred
without his rifle and hated indians like snakes

your moredock then would seem a moredock of
misanthrope hall   the woods no very sleek creature
the colonel i fancy

sleek or not he was no uncombed one but silky
bearded and curly headed and to all but indians juicy
as a peach but indians   how the late colonel john
moredock indian-hater of illinois did hate indians to
be sure

never heard of such a thing hate indians why
should he or anybody else hate indians i admire
indians indians i have always heard to be one of the
finest of the primitive races possessed of many heroic
virtues some noble women too when i think of
pocahontas i am ready to love indians then there's
massasoit and philip of mount hope and tecumseh
and red-jacket and logan   all heroes and there's the
five nations and araucanians   federations and communities
of heroes god bless me hate indians surely
the late colonel john moredock must have wandered in
his mind

wandered in the woods considerably but never
wandered elsewhere that i ever heard




are you in earnest was there ever one who so
made it his particular mission to hate indians that to
designate him a special word has been coined   indian-hater

even so

dear me you take it very calmly   but really i
would like to know something about this indian-hating
i can hardly believe such a thing to be could you
favor me with a little history of the extraordinary man
you mentioned

with all my heart and immediately stepping from
the porch gestured the cosmopolitan to a settee near
by on deck there sir sit you there and i will sit
here beside you   you desire to hear of colonel john
moredock well a day in my boyhood is marked with
a white stone   the day i saw the colonel's rifle powder-horn
attached hanging in a cabin on the west bank
of the wabash river i was going westward a long journey
through the wilderness with my father it was
nigh noon and we had stopped at the cabin to unsaddle
and bait the man at the cabin pointed out the rifle and
told whose it was adding that the colonel was that
moment sleeping on wolf-skins in the corn-loft above
so we must not talk very loud for the colonel had been
out all night hunting indians mind and it would be
cruel to disturb his sleep curious to see one so famous
we waited two hours over in hopes he would come
forth but he did not so it being necessary to get to
the next cabin before nightfall we had at last to ride off
without the wished-for satisfaction though to tell the




truth i for one did not go away entirely ungratified
for while my father was watering the horses i slipped
back into the cabin and stepping a round or two up the
ladder pushed my head through the trap and peered
about not much light in the loft but off in the further
corner i saw what i took to be the wolf-skins and
on them a bundle of something like a drift of leaves
and at one end what seemed a moss-ball and over it
deer-antlers branched and close by a small squirrel
sprang out from a maple-bowl of nuts brushed the moss-ball
with his tail through a hole and vanished squeaking
that bit of woodland scene was all i saw no
colonel moredock there unless that moss-ball was his
curly head seen in the back view i would have gone
clear up but the man below had warned me that
though from his camping habits the colonel could sleep
through thunder he was for the same cause amazing
quick to waken at the sound of footsteps however soft
and especially if human

excuse me said the other softly laying his hand
on the narrator's wrist but i fear the colonel was of
a distrustful nature   little or no confidence he was a
little suspicious-minded wasn't he

not a bit knew too much suspected nobody
but was not ignorant of indians well though as
you may gather i never fully saw the man yet have i
one way and another heard about as much of him as
any other in particular have i heard his history again
and again from my father's friend james hall the judge
you know in every company being called upon to




give this history which none could better do the judge
at last fell into a style so methodic you would have
thought he spoke less to mere auditors than to an invisible
amanuensis seemed talking for the press very impressive
way with him indeed and i having an equally
impressible memory think that upon a pinch i can
render you the judge upon the colonel almost word for
word

do so by all means said the cosmopolitan well
pleased

shall i give you the judge's philosophy and all

as to that rejoined the other gravely pausing over
the pipe-bowl he was filling the desirableness to a
man of a certain mind of having another man's philosophy
given depends considerably upon what school of
philosophy that other man belongs to of what school
or system was the judge pray

why though he knew how to read and write the
judge never had much schooling but i should say he
belonged if anything to the free-school system yes a
true patriot the judge went in strong for free-schools

in philosophy the man of a certain mind then
while respecting the judge's patriotism and not blind
to the judge's capacity for narrative such as he may
prove to have might perhaps with prudence waive an
opinion of the judge's probable philosophy but i am
no rigorist proceed i beg his philosophy or not as
you please

well i would mostly skip that part only to begin
some reconnoitering of the ground in a philosophical




way the judge always deemed indispensable with strangers
for you must know that indian-hating was no
monopoly of colonel moredock's but a passion in one
form or other and to a degree greater or less largely
shared among the class to which he belonged and
indian-hating still exists and no doubt will continue
to exist so long as indians do indian-hating then
shall be my first theme and colonel moredock the indian-hater
my next and last

with which the stranger settling himself in his seat
commenced   the hearer paying marked regard slowly
smoking his glance meanwhile steadfastly abstracted
towards the deck but his right ear so disposed towards
the speaker that each word came through as little atmospheric
intervention as possible to intensify the
sense of hearing he seemed to sink the sense of sight
no complaisance of mere speech could have been so
flattering or expressed such striking politeness as this
mute eloquence of thoroughly digesting attention






containing the metaphysics of indian-hating according to the
views of one evidently not so prepossessed as rousseau in
favor of savages


 the judge always began in these words the
backwoodsman's hatred of the indian has been a topic
for some remark in the earlier times of the frontier
the passion was thought to be readily accounted for
but indian rapine having mostly ceased through regions
where it once prevailed the philanthropist is surprised
that indian-hating has not in like degree ceased with it
he wonders why the backwoodsman still regards the
red man in much the same spirit that a jury does a
murderer or a trapper a wild cat   a creature in whose
behalf mercy were not wisdom truce is vain he must
be executed

a curious point the judge would continue which
perhaps not everybody even upon explanation may fully
understand while in order for any one to approach to
an understanding it is necessary for him to learn or if
he already know to bear in mind what manner of man
the backwoodsman is as for what manner of man the
indian is many know either from history or experience




the backwoodsman is a lonely man he is a thoughtful
man he is a man strong and unsophisticated impulsive
he is what some might call unprincipled at
any rate he is self-willed being one who less hearkens
to what others may say about things than looks for
himself to see what are things themselves if in straits
there are few to help he must depend upon himself
he must continually look to himself hence self-reliance
to the degree of standing by his own judgment
though it stand alone not that he deems himself
infallible too many mistakes in following trails prove
the contrary but he thinks that nature destines such
sagacity as she has given him as she destines it to the
possum to these fellow-beings of the wilds their
untutored sagacity is their best dependence if with
either it prove faulty if the possum's betray it to the
trap or the backwoodsman's mislead him into ambuscade
there are consequences to be undergone but no selfblame
as with the possum instincts prevail with
the backwoodsman over precepts like the possum
the backwoodsman presents the spectacle of a creature
dwelling exclusively among the works of god yet
these truth must confess breed little in him of a godly
mind small bowing and scraping is his further than
when with bent knee he points his rifle or picks its
flint with few companions solitude by necessity his
lengthened lot he stands the trial   no slight one since
next to dying solitude rightly borne is perhaps of for
titude the most rigorous test but not merely is the
backwoodsman content to be alone but in no few cases




is anxious to be so the sight of smoke ten miles off is
provocation to one more remove from man one step
deeper into nature is it that he feels that whatever man
may be man is not the universe that glory beauty
kindness are not all engrossed by him that as the
presence of man frights birds away so many bird-like
thoughts be that how it will the backwoodsman is
not without some fineness to his nature hairy orson as
he looks it may be with him as with the shetland seal   
beneath the bristles lurks the fur

though held in a sort a barbarian the backwoodsman
would seem to america what alexander was to
asia   captain in the vanguard of conquering civilization
whatever the nation's growing opulence or power does
it not lackey his heels pathfinder provider of security
to those who come after him for himself he asks
nothing but hardship worthy to be compared with
moses in the exodus or the emperor julian in gaul
who on foot and bare-browed at the head of covered
or mounted legions marched so through the elements
day after day the tide of emigration let it roll as it
will never overwhelms the backwoodsman into itself
he rides upon advance as the polynesian upon the comb
of the surf

thus though he keep moving on through life he
maintains with respect to nature much the same unaltered
relation throughout with her creatures too
including panthers and indians hence it is not
unlikely that accurate as the theory of the peace congress
may be with respect to those two varieties of




beings among others yet the backwoodsman might be
qualified to throw out some practical suggestions

as the child born to a backwoodsman must in turn
lead his father's life   a life which as related to humanity
is related mainly to indians   it is thought best
not to mince matters out of delicacy but to tell the boy
pretty plainly what an indian is and what he must expect
from him for however charitable it may be to
view indians as members of the society of friends yet
to affirm them such to one ignorant of indians whose
lonely path lies a long way through their lands this in
the event might prove not only injudicious but cruel
at least something of this kind would seem the maxim
upon which backswoods education is based accordingly
if in youth the backwoodsman incline to knowledge
as is generally the case he hears little from his
schoolmasters the old chroniclers of the forest but histories
of indian lying indian theft indian doubledealing
indian fraud and perfidy indian want of
conscience indian blood-thirstiness indian diabolism   
histories which though of wild woods are almost as
full of things unangelic as the newgate calendar or the
annals of europe in these indian narratives and traditions
the lad is thoroughly grounded as the twig
is bent the tree's inclined the instinct of antipathy
against an indian grows in the backwoodsman with the
sense of good and bad right and wrong in one breath
he learns that a brother is to be loved and an indian to
be hated

such are the facts the judge would say upon




which if one seek to moralize he must do so with an
eye to them it is terrible that one creature should so
regard another should make it conscience to abhor an
entire race it is terrible but is it surprising surprising
that one should hate a race which he believes to
be red from a cause akin to that which makes some tribes
of garden insects green a race whose name is upon
the frontier a memento mori painted to him in every evil
light now a horse-thief like those in moyamensing
now an assassin like a new york rowdy now a treatybreaker
like an austrian now a palmer with poisoned
arrows now a judicial murderer and jeffries after a
fierce farce of trial condemning his victim to bloody
death or a jew with hospitable speeches cozening
some fainting stranger into ambuscade there to burk
him and account it a deed grateful to manitou his god

still all this is less advanced as truths of the indians
than as examples of the backwoodsman's impression of
them   in which the charitable may think he does them
some injustice certain it is the indians themselves
think so quite unanimously too the indians in
deed protest against the backwoodsman's view of
them and some think that one cause of their returning
his antipathy so sincerely as they do is their moral indignation
at being so libeled by him as they really believe
and say but whether on this or any point the
indians should be permitted to testify for themselves
to the exclusion of other testimony is a question that
may be left to the supreme court at any rate it has
been observed that when an indian becomes a genuine




proselyte to christianity such cases however not being
very many though indeed entire tribes are sometimes
nominally brought to the true light he will not in that
case conceal his enlightened conviction that his race's
portion by nature is total depravity and in that way
as much as admits that the backwoodsman's worst idea
of it is not very far from true while on the other hand
those red men who are the greatest sticklers for the
theory of indian virtue and indian loving-kindness are
sometimes the arrantest horse-thieves and tomahawkers
among them so at least avers the backwoodsman
and though knowing the indian nature as he thinks he
does he fancies he is not ignorant that an indian may
in some points deceive himself almost as effectually as in
bush-tactics he can another yet his theory and his practice
as above contrasted seem to involve an inconsistency
so extreme that the backwoodsman only accounts for it
on the supposition that when a tomahawking red-man
advances the notion of the benignity of the red race it
it but part and parcel with that subtle strategy which
he finds so useful in war in hunting and the general
conduct of life

in further explanation of that deep abhorrence with
which the backwoodsman regards the savage the judge
used to think it might perhaps a little help to consider
what kind of stimulus to it is furnished in those forest
histories and traditions before spoken of in which behalf
he would tell the story of the little colony of
wrights and weavers originally seven cousins from virginia
who after successive removals with their families




at last established themselves near the southern frontier
of the bloody ground kentucky they were strong
brave men but unlike many of the pioneers in those
days theirs was no love of conflict for conflict's sake
step by step they had been lured to their lonely restingplace
by the ever-beckoning seductions of a fertile and
virgin land with a singular exemption during the march
from indian molestation but clearings made and
houses built the bright shield was soon to turn its other
side after repeated persecutions and eventual hostilities
forced on them by a dwindled tribe in their neighborhood   
persecutions resulting in loss of crops and
cattle hostilities in which they lost two of their number
illy to be spared besides others getting painful
wounds   the five remaining cousins made with some
serious concessions a kind of treaty with mocmohoc
the chief   being to this induced by the harryings of
the enemy leaving them no peace but they were
further prompted indeed first incited by the suddenly
changed ways of mocmohoc who though hitherto
deemed a savage almost perfidious as csar borgia yet
now put on a seeming the reverse of this engaging to
bury the hatchet smoke the pipe and be friends forever
not friends in the mere sense of renouncing
enmity but in the sense of kindliness active and familiar

but what the chief now seemed did not wholly
blind them to what the chief had been so that though
in no small degree influenced by his change of bearing
they still distrusted him enough to covenant with him




among other articles on their side that though friendly
visits should be exchanged between the wigwams and
the cabins yet the five cousins should never on any
account be expected to enter the chief's lodge together
the intention was though they reserved it that if ever
under the guise of amity the chief should mean them
mischief and effect it it should be but partially so that
some of the five might survive not only for their families
sake but also for retribution's nevertheless mocmohoc
did upon a time with such fine art and pleasing
carriage win their confidence that he brought them
all together to a feast of bear's meat and there by stratagem
ended them years after over their calcined bones
and those of all their families the chief reproached for
his treachery by a proud hunter whom he had made captive
jeered out treachery pale face twas they
who broke their covenant first in coming all together
they that broke it first in trusting mocmohoc

at this point the judge would pause and lifting his
hand and rolling his eyes exclaim in a solemn enough
voice circling wiles and bloody lusts the acuteness
and genius of the chief but make him the more atrocious


after another pause he would begin an imaginary
kind of dialogue between a backwoodsman and a questioner

but are all indians like mocmohoc   not all have
proved such but in the least harmful may lie his germ
there is an indian nature indian blood is in me is the
half-breed's threat   but are not some indians kind   




yes but kind indians are mostly lazy and reputed simple   
at all events are seldom chiefs chiefs among the
red men being taken from the active and those accounted
wise hence with small promotion kind indians
have but proportionate influence and kind
indians may be forced to do unkind biddings so beware
the indian kind or unkind said daniel boone who
lost his sons by them   but have all you backwoodsmen
been some way victimized by indians   no   well
and in certain cases may not at least some few of you be
favored by them   yes but scarce one among us so
self-important or so selfish-minded as to hold his personal
exemption from indian outrage such a set-off
against the contrary experience of so many others as
that he must needs in a general way think well of indians
or if he do an arrow in his flank might suggest a
pertinent doubt

in short according to the judge if we at all credit
the backwoodsman his feeling against indians to be
taken aright must be considered as being not so much
on his own account as on others or jointly on both
accounts true it is scarce a family he knows but some
member of it or connection has been by indians maimed
or scalped what avails then that some one indian or
some two or three treat a backwoodsman friendly-like
he fears me he thinks take my rifle from me give
him motive and what will come or if not so how
know i what involuntary preparations may be going
on in him for things as unbeknown in present time to
him as me   a sort of chemical preparation in the soul




for malice as chemical preparation in the body for
malady

not that the backwoodsman ever used those words
you see but the judge found him expression for his
meaning and this point he would conclude with saying
that what is called a friendly indian is a very rare
sort of creature and well it was so for no ruthlessness
exceeds that of a friendly indian turned enemy
a coward friend he makes a valiant foe

but thus far the passion in question has been
viewed in a general way as that of a community when
to his due share of this the backwoodsman adds his private
passion we have then the stock out of which is
formed if formed at all the indian-hater par excellence


the indian-hater par excellence the judge defined to
be one who having with his mother's milk drank in
small love for red men in youth or early manhood ere
the sensibilities become osseous receives at their hand
some signal outrage or which in effect is much the same
some of his kin have or some friend now nature
all around him by her solitudes wooing or bidding him
muse upon this matter he accordingly does so till the
thought develops such attraction that much as straggling
vapors troop from all sides to a storm-cloud so
straggling thoughts of other outrages troop to the nucleus
thought assimilate with it and swell it at last
taking counsel with the elements he comes to his resolution
an intenser hannibal he makes a vow the hate
of which is a vortex from whose suction scarce the




remotest chip of the guilty race may reasonably feel
secure next he declares himself and settles his temporal
affairs with the solemnity of a spaniard turned
monk he takes leave of his kin or rather these leavetakings
have something of the still more impressive
finality of death-bed adieus last he commits himself
to the forest primeval there so long as life shall be his
to act upon a calm cloistered scheme of strategical implacable
and lonesome vengeance ever on the noiseless
trail cool collected patient less seen than felt
snuffing smelling   a leather-stocking nemesis in the
settlements he will not be seen again in eyes of old
companions tears may start at some chance thing that
speaks of him but they never look for him nor call
they know he will not come suns and seasons fleet
the tiger-lily blows and falls babes are born and leap in
their mothers arms but the indian-hater is good as
gone to his long home and terror is his epitaph

here the judge not unaffected would pause again
but presently resume how evident that in strict speech
there can be no biography of an indian-hater par excel
lence any more than one of a sword-fish or other deepsea
denizen or which is still less imaginable one of a
dead man the career of the indian-hater par excellence
has the impenetrability of the fate of a lost steamer
doubtless events terrible ones have happened must
have happened but the powers that be in nature have
taken order that they shall never becomes news

but luckily for the curious there is a species of diluted
indian-hater one whose heart proves not so steely




as his brain soft enticements of domestic life too
often draw him from the ascetic trail a monk who
apostatizes to the world at times like a mariner too
though much abroad he may have a wife and family in
some green harbor which he does not forget it is with
him as with the papist converts in senegal fasting and
mortification prove hard to bear

the judge with his usual judgment always thought
that the intense solitude to which the indian-hater consigns
himself has by its overawing influence no little
to do with relaxing his vow he would relate instances
where after some months lonely scoutings the
indian-hater is suddenly seized with a sort of calenture
hurries openly towards the first smoke though he knows
it is an indian's announces himself as a lost hunter
gives the savage his rifle throws himself upon his charity
embraces him with much affection imploring the
privilege of living a while in his sweet companionship
what is too often the sequel of so distempered a procedure
may be best known by those who best know the
indian upon the whole the judge by two and thirty
good and sufficient reasons would maintain that there
was no known vocation whose consistent following calls
for such self-containings as that of the indian-hater par
excellence in the highest view he considered such a soul
one peeping out but once an age

for the diluted indian-hater although the vacations
he permits himself impair the keeping of the character
yet it should not be overlooked that this is the man
who by his very infirmity enables us to form surmises




however inadequate of what indian-hating in its perfection
is

one moment gently interrupted the cosmopolitan
here and let me refill my calumet

which being done the other proceeded   






some account of a man of questionable morality but who
nevertheless
would seem entitled to the esteem of that eminent
english moralist who said he liked a good hater


 coming to mention the man to whose story all thus
far said was but the introduction the judge who like
you was a great smoker would insist upon all the company
taking cigars and then lighting a fresh one himself
rise in his place and with the solemnest voice say   
gentlemen let us smoke to the memory of colonel john
moredock when after several whiffs taken standing in
deep silence and deeper reverie he would resume his
seat and his discourse something in these words

though colonel john moredock was not an indian-hater
par excellence he yet cherished a kind of sentiment
towards the red man and in that degree and so acted
out his sentiment as sufficiently to merit the tribute
just rendered to his memory

john moredock was the son of a woman married
thrice and thrice widowed by a tomahawk the three
successive husbands of this woman had been pioneers
and with them she had wandered from wilderness to
wilderness always on the frontier with nine children




she at last found herself at a little clearing afterwards
vincennes there she joined a company about to remove
to the new country of illinois on the eastern
side of illinois there were then no settlements but on
the west side the shore of the mississippi there were
near the mouth of the kaskaskia some old hamlets
of french to the vicinity of those hamlets very innocent
and pleasant places a new arcadia mrs moredock's
party was destined for thereabouts among the vines
they meant to settle they embarked upon the wabash
in boats proposing descending that stream into the
ohio and the ohio into the mississippi and so northwards
towards the point to be reached all went well
till they made the rock of the grand tower on the mississippi
where they had to land and drag their boats
round a point swept by a strong current here a party
of indians lying in wait rushed out and murdered
nearly all of them the widow was among the victims
with her children john excepted who some fifty miles
distant was following with a second party

he was just entering upon manhood when thus left
in nature sole survivor of his race other youngsters
might have turned mourners he turned avenger
his nerves were electric wires   sensitive but steel he
was one who from self-possession could be made neither
to flush nor pale it is said that when the tidings
were brought him he was ashore sitting beneath a hemlock
eating his dinner of venison   and as the tidings
were told him after the first start he kept on eating
but slowly and deliberately chewing the wild news




with the wild meat as if both together turned to chyle
together should sinew him to his intent from that meal
he rose an indian-hater he rose got his arms prevailed
upon some comrades to join him and without delay
started to discover who were the actual transgressors
they proved to belong to a band of twenty renegades
from various tribes outlaws even among indians and
who had formed themselves into a maurauding crew
no opportunity for action being at the time presented
he dismissed his friends told them to go on thanking
them and saying he would ask their aid at some future
day for upwards of a year alone in the wilds he
watched the crew once what he thought a favorable
chance having occurred   it being midwinter and the
savages encamped apparently to remain so   he anew
mustered his friends and marched against them but
getting wind of his coming the enemy fled and in
such panic that everything was left behind but their
weapons during the winter much the same thing
happened upon two subsequent occasions the next
year he sought them at the head of a party pledged to
serve him for forty days at last the hour came it
was on the shore of the mississippi from their covert
moredock and his men dimly descried the gang of cains
in the red dusk of evening paddling over to a jungled
island in mid-stream there the more securely to lodge
for moredock's retributive spirit in the wilderness spoke
ever to their trepidations now like the voice calling
through the garden waiting until dead of night the
whites swam the river towing after them a raft laden




with their arms on landing moredock cut the fastenings
of the enemy's canoes and turned them with his
own raft adrift resolved that there should be neither
escape for the indians nor safety except in victory for
the whites victorious the whites were but three of
the indians saved themselves by taking to the stream
moredock's band lost not a man

three of the murderers survived he knew their
names and persons in the course of three years each
successively fell by his own hand all were now dead
but this did not suffice he made no avowal but to
kill indians had become his passion as an athlete he
had few equals as a shot none in single combat not
to be beaten master of that woodland-cunning enabling
the adept to subsist where the tyro would perish and
expert in all those arts by which an enemy is pursued
for weeks perhaps months without once suspecting it
he kept to the forest the solitary indian that met him
died when a murder was descried he would either
secretly pursue their track for some chance to strike at
least one blow or if while thus engaged he himself
was discovered he would elude them by superior skill

many years he spent thus and though after a time
he was in a degree restored to the ordinary life of the
region and period yet it is believed that john moredock
never let pass an opportunity of quenching an indian
sins of commission in that kind may have been his but
none of omission

it were to err to suppose the judge would say that
this gentleman was naturally ferocious or peculiarly




possessed of those qualities which unhelped by provocation
of events tend to withdraw man from social life
on the contrary moredock was an example of something
apparently self-contradicting certainly curious but at
the same time undeniable namely that nearly all indian-haters
have at bottom loving hearts at any rate
hearts if anything more generous than the average
certain it is that to the degree in which he mingled in
the life of the settlements moredock showed himself
not without humane feelings no cold husband or colder
father he and though often and long away from his
household bore its needs in mind and provided for them
he could be very convivial told a good story though
never of his more private exploits and sung a capital
song hospitable not backward to help a neighbor by
report benevolent as retributive in secret while in a
general manner though sometimes grave   as is not unusual
with men of his complexion a sultry and tragical
brown   yet with nobody indians excepted otherwise
than courteous in a manly fashion a moccasined
gentleman admired and loved in fact no one more
popular as an incident to follow may prove

his bravery whether in indian fight or any other
was unquestionable an officer in the ranging service
during the war of he acquitted himself with more
than credit of his soldierly character this anecdote is
told not long after hull's dubious surrender at detroit
moredock with some of his rangers rode up at night to a
log-house there to rest till morning the horses being
attended to supper over and sleeping-places assigned




the troop the host showed the colonel his best bed
not on the ground like the rest but a bed that stood on
legs but out of delicacy the guest declined to monopolize
it or indeed to occupy it at all when to increase
the inducement as the host thought he was told that a
general officer had once slept in that bed who pray
asked the colonel general hull then you must
not take offense said the colonel buttoning up his coat
but really no coward's bed for me however comfortable
accordingly he took up with valor's bed   a cold
one on the ground

at one time the colonel was a member of the territorial
council of illinois ands at the formation of the
state government was pressed to become candidate for
governor but begged to be excused and though he
declined to give his reasons for declining yet by those
who best knew him the cause was not wholly unsurmised
in his official capacity he might be called upon
to enter into friendly treaties with indian tribes a thing
not to be thought of and even did no such contingency
arise yet he felt there would be an impropriety in
the governor of illinois stealing out now and then
during a recess of the legislative bodies for a few days
shooting at human beings within the limits of his paternal
chief-magistracy if the governorship offered large
honors from moredock it demanded larger sacrifices
these were incompatibles in short he was not unaware
that to be a consistent indian-hater involves the
renunciation of ambition with its objects   the pomps
and glories of the world and since religion pronouncing




such things vanities accounts it merit to renounce them
therefore so far as this goes indian-hating whatever
may be thought of it in other respects may be regarded
as not wholly without the efficacy of a devout sentiment

here the narrator paused then after his long and
irksome sitting started to his feet and regulating his
disordered shirt-frill and at the same time adjustingly
shaking his legs down in his rumpled pantaloons concluded
there i have done having given you not
my story mind or my thoughts but another's and
now for your friend coonskins i doubt not that if the
judge were here he would pronounce him a sort of
comprehensive colonel moredock who too much spreading
his passion shallows it






moot points touching the late colonel john moredock


 charity charity exclaimed the cosmopolitan
never a sound judgment without charity when man
judges man charity is less a bounty from our mercy
than just allowance for the insensible lee-way of human
fallibility god forbid that my eccentric friend should
be what you hint you do not know him or but imperfectly
his outside deceived you at first it came
near deceiving even me but i seized a chance when
owing to indignation against some wrong he laid himself
a little open i seized that lucky chance i say to
inspect his heart and found it an inviting oyster in a forbidding
shell his outside is but put on ashamed of his
own goodness he treats mankind as those strange old
uncles in romances do their nephews   snapping at them
all the time and yet loving them as the apple of their
eye

well my words with him were few perhaps he is
not what i took him for yes for aught i know you
may be right

glad to hear it charity like poetry should be
cultivated if only for its being graceful and now since




you have renounced your notion i should be happy
would you so to speak renounce your story too that
story strikes me with even more incredulity than wonder
to me some parts don't hang together if the
man of hate how could john moredock be also the
man of love either his lone campaigns are fabulous
as hercules or else those being true what was
thrown in about his geniality is but garnish in short
if ever there was such a man as moredock he in my
way of thinking was either misanthrope or nothing
and his misanthropy the more intense from being focused
on one race of men though like suicide man-hatred
would seem peculiarly a roman and a grecian
passion   that is pagan yet the annals of neither rome
nor greece can produce the equal in man-hatred of
colonel moredock as the judge and you have painted
him as for this indian-hating in general i can only
say of it what dr johnson said of the alleged lisbon
earthquake sir i don't believe it

didn't believe it why not clashed with any
little prejudice of his

doctor johnson had no prejudice but like a certain
other person with an ingenuous smile he had
sensibilities and those were pained

dr johnson was a good christian wasn't he

he was

suppose he had been something else

then small incredulity as to the alleged earthquake

suppose he had been also a misanthrope




then small incredulity as to the robberies and murders
alleged to have been perpetrated under the pall of
smoke and ashes the infidels of the time were quick
to credit those reports and worse so true is it that
while religion contrary to the common notion implies
in certain cases a spirit of slow reserve as to assent
infidelity which claims to despise credulity is sometimes
swift to it

you rather jumble together misanthropy and infidelity

i do not jumble them they are cordinates for
misanthropy springing from the same root with disbelief
of religion is twin with that it springs from
the same root i say for set aside materialism and
what is an atheist but one who does not or will not
see in the universe a ruling principle of love and
what a misanthrope but one who does not or will
not see in man a ruling principle of kindness don't
you see in either case the vice consists in a want of
confidence

what sort of a sensation is misanthropy

might as well ask me what sort of sensation is
hydrophobia don't know never had it but i have
often wondered what it can be like can a misanthrope
feel warm i ask myself take ease be companionable
with himself can a misanthrope smoke
a cigar and muse how fares he in solitude has
the misanthrope such a thing as an appetite shall a
peach refresh him the effervescence of champagne
with what eye does he behold it is summer good to




him of long winters how much can he sleep what
are his dreams how feels he and what does he when
suddenly awakened alone at dead of night by fusilades
of thunder

like you said the stranger i can't understand the
misanthrope so far as my experience goes either mankind
is worthy one's best love or else i have been lucky
never has it been my lot to have been wronged though
but in the smallest degree cheating backbiting superciliousness
disdain hard-heartedness and all that
brood i know but by report cold regards tossed over
the sinister shoulder of a former friend ingratitude in
a beneficiary treachery in a confidant   such things may
be but i must take somebody's word for it now the
bridge that has carried me so well over shall i not
praise it

ingratitude to the worthy bridge not to do so
man is a noble fellow and in an age of satirists i am
not displeased to find one who has confidence in him
and bravely stands up for him

yes i always speak a good word for man and what
is more am always ready to do a good deed for
him

you are a man after my own heart responded the
cosmopolitan with a candor which lost nothing by its
calmness indeed he added our sentiments agree
so that were they written in a book whose was whose
few but the nicest critics might determine

since we are thus joined in mind said the stranger
why not be joined in hand




my hand is always at the service of virtue frankly
extending it to him as to virtue personified

and now said the stranger cordially retaining his
hand you know our fashion here at the west it may
be a little low but it is kind briefly we being newlymade
friends must drink together what say you

thank you but indeed you must excuse me

why

because to tell the truth i have to-day met so
many old friends all free-hearted convivial gentlemen
that really really though for the present i succeed in
mastering it i am at bottom almost in the condition of
a sailor who stepping ashore after a long voyage ere
night reels with loving welcomes his head of less capacity
than his heart

at the allusion to old friends the stranger's countenance
a little fell as a jealous lover's might at hearing
from his sweetheart of former ones but rallying he
said no doubt they treated you to something strong
but wine   surely that gentle creature wine come let
us have a little gentle wine at one of these little tables
here come come then essaying to roll about like
a full pipe in the sea sang in a voice which had had more
of good-fellowship had there been less of a latent squeak
to it


let us drink of the wine of the vine benign
that sparkles warm in zansovine

the cosmopolitan with longing eye upon him stood
as sorely tempted and wavering a moment then




abruptly stepping towards him with a look of dissolved surrender
said when mermaid songs move figure-heads
then may glory gold and women try their blandishments
on me but a good fellow singing a good song
he woos forth my every spike so that my whole hull
like a ship's sailing by a magnetic rock caves in with
acquiescence enough when one has a heart of a certain
sort it is in vain trying to be resolute







the boon companions


the wine port being called for and the two seated
at the little table a natural pause of convivial expectancy
ensued the stranger's eye turned towards the bar
near by watching the red-cheeked white-aproned man
there blithely dusting the bottle and invitingly arranging
the salver and glasses when with a sudden impulse
turning round his head towards his companion he said
ours is friendship at first sight ain't it

it is was the placidly pleased reply and the
same may be said of friendship at first sight as of love
at first sight it is the only true one the only noble
one it bespeaks confidence who would go sounding
his way into love or friendship like a strange ship by
night into an enemy's harbor

right boldly in before the wind agreeable how
we always agree by-the-way though but a formality
friends should know each other's names what is yours
pray

francis goodman but those who love me call me
frank and yours




charles arnold noble but do you call me
charlie

i will charlie nothing like preserving in manhood
the fraternal familiarities of youth it proves the heart
a rosy boy to the last

my sentiments again ah

it was a smiling waiter with the smiling bottle the
cork drawn a common quart bottle but for the occasion
fitted at bottom into a little bark basket braided
with porcupine quills gayly tinted in the indian fashion
this being set before the entertainer he regarded it
with affectionate interest but seemed not to understand
or else to pretend not to a handsome red label pasted
on the bottle bearing the capital letters p w

p w said he at last perplexedly eying the pleasing
poser now what does p w mean

shouldn't wonder said the cosmopolitan gravely
if it stood for port wine you called for port wine
didn't you

why so it is so it is

i find some little mysteries not very hard to clear
up said the other quietly crossing his legs

this commonplace seemed to escape the stranger's
hearing for full of his bottle he now rubbed his somewhat
sallow hands over it and with a strange kind of
cackle meant to be a chirrup cried good wine good
wine is it not the peculiar bond of good feeling
then brimming both glasses pushed one over saying
with what seemed intended for an air of fine disdain
ill betide those gloomy skeptics who maintain that




now-a-days pure wine is unpurchasable that almost
every variety on sale is less the vintage of vineyards
than laboratories that most bar-keepers are but a set
of male brinvilliarses with complaisant arts practicing
against the lives of their best friends their customers

a shade passed over the cosmopolitan after a few
minutes down-cast musing he lifted his eyes and said
i have long thought my dear charlie that the spirit
in which wine is regarded by too many in these days is
one of the most painful examples of want of confidence
look at these glasses he who could mistrust poison
in this wine would mistrust consumption in hebe's
cheek while as for suspicions against the dealers in
wine and sellers of it those who cherish such suspicions
can have but limited trust in the human heart each
human heart they must think to be much like each bottle
of port not such port as this but such port as they
hold to strange traducers who see good faith in nothing
however sacred not medicines not the wine in
sacraments has escaped them the doctor with his
phial and the priest with his chalice they deem equally
the unconscious dispensers of bogus cordials to the
dying

dreadful

dreadful indeed said the cosmopolitan solemnly
these distrusters stab at the very soul of confidence
if this wine impressively holding up his full glass if
this wine with its bright promise be not true how shall
man be whose promise can be no brighter but if wine
be false while men are true whither shall fly convivial




geniality to think of sincerely-genial souls drinking
each other's health at unawares in perfidious and murderous
drugs

horrible

much too much so to be true charlie let us forget
it come you are my entertainer on this occasion
and yet you don't pledge me i have been waiting for
it

pardon pardon half confusedly and half ostentatiously
lifting his glass i pledge you frank with
my whole heart believe me taking a draught too decorous
to be large but which small though it was was
followed by a slight involuntary wryness to the mouth

and i return you the pledge charlie heart-warm
as it came to me and honest as this wine i drink it in
reciprocated the cosmopolitan with princely kindliness in
his gesture taking a generous swallow concluding in a
smack which though audible was not so much so as to
be unpleasing

talking of alleged spuriousness of wines said he
tranquilly setting down his glass and then sloping back
his head and with friendly fixedness eying the wine
perhaps the strangest part of those allegings is that
there is as claimed a kind of man who while convinced
that on this continent most wines are shams yet still
drinks away at them accounting wine so fine a thing
that even the sham article is better than none at all and
if the temperance people urge that by this course he
will sooner or later be undermined in health he answers
and do you think i don't know that but health




without cheer i hold a bore and cheer even of the
spurious sort has its price which i am willing to
pay

such a man frank must have a disposition ungovernably
bacchanalian

yes if such a man there be which i don't credit
it is a fable but a fable from which i once heard a person
of less genius than grotesqueness draw a moral even
more extravagant than the fable itself he said that it
illustrated as in a parable how that a man of a disposition
ungovernably good-natured might still familiarly
associate with men though at the same time he believed
the greater part of men false-hearted   accounting society
so sweet a thing that even the spurious sort was
better than none at all and if the rochefoucaultites
urge that by this course he will sooner or later be undermined
in security he answers and do you think i
don't know that but security without society i hold
a bore and society even of the spurious sort has its
price which i am willing to pay

a most singular theory said the stranger with a
slight fidget eying his companion with some inquisitiveness
indeed frank a most slanderous thought he
exclaimed in sudden heat and with an involuntary look
almost of being personally aggrieved

in one sense it merits all you say and more rejoined
the other with wonted mildness but for a kind
of drollery in it charity might perhaps overlook something
of the wickedness humor is in fact so blessed a
thing that even in the least virtuous product of the




human mind if there can be found but nine good jokes
some philosophers are clement enough to affirm that
those nine good jokes should redeem all the wicked
thoughts though plenty as the populace of sodom at
any rate this same humor has something there is no
telling what of beneficence in it it is such a catholicon
and charm   nearly all men agreeing in relishing it
though they may agree in little else   and in its way it
undeniably does such a deal of familiar good in the
world that no wonder it is almost a proverb that a man
of humor a man capable of a good loud laugh   seem
how he may in other things   can hardly be a heartless
scamp

ha ha ha laughed the other pointing to the
figure of a pale pauper-boy on the deck below whose
pitiableness was touched as it were with ludicrousness
by a pair of monstrous boots apparently some mason's
discarded ones cracked with drouth half eaten by lime
and curled up about the toe like a bassoon look   
ha ha ha

i see said the other with what seemed quiet appreciation
but of a kind expressing an eye to the grotesque
without blindness to what in this case accompanied
it i see and the way in which it moves you
charlie comes in very apropos to point the proverb i
was speaking of indeed had you intended this effect
it could not have been more so for who that heard
that laugh but would as naturally argue from it a
sound heart as sound lungs true it is said that a
man may smile and smile and smile and be a villain




but it is not said that a man may laugh and laugh and
laugh and be one is it charlie

ha ha ha   no no no no

why charlie your explosions illustrate my remarks
almost as aptly as the chemist's imitation volcano did
his lectures but even if experience did not sanction
the proverb that a good laugher cannot be a bad man i
should yet feel bound in confidence to believe it since
it is a saying current among the people and i doubt
not originated among them and hence must be true for
the voice of the people is the voice of truth don't
you think so

of course i do if truth don't speak through the
people it never speaks at all so i heard one say

a true saying but we stray the popular notion
of humor considered as index to the heart would seem
curiously confirmed by aristotle   i think in his politics
a work by-the-by which however it may be
viewed upon the whole yet from the tenor of certain
sections should not without precaution be placed in
the hands of youth   who remarks that the least lovable
men in history seem to have had for humor not only a
disrelish but a hatred and this in some cases along
with an extraordinary dry taste for practical punning
i remember it is related of phalaris the capricious
tyrant of sicily that he once caused a poor fellow to be
beheaded on a horse-block for no other cause than having
a horse-laugh

funny phalaris

cruel phalaris




as after fire-crackers there was a pause both looking
downward on the table as if mutually struck by the
contrast of exclamations and pondering upon its significance
if any so at least it seemed but on one side
it might have been otherwise for presently glancing up
the cosmopolitan said in the instance of the moral
drolly cynic drawn from the queer bacchanalian fellow
we were speaking of who had his reasons for still drinking
spurious wine though knowing it to be such   there
i say we have an example of what is certainly a wicked
thought but conceived in humor i will now give you
one of a wicked thought conceived in wickedness you
shall compare the two and answer whether in the one
case the sting is not neutralized by the humor and
whether in the other the absence of humor does not
leave the sting free play i once heard a wit a mere
wit mind an irreligious parisian wit say with regard
to the temperance movement that none to their personal
benefit joined it sooner than niggards and knaves
because as he affirmed the one by it saved money and
the other made money as in ship-owners cutting off
the spirit ration without giving its equivalent and
gamblers and all sorts of subtle tricksters sticking to
cold water the better to keep a cool head for business

a wicked thought indeed cried the stranger
feelingly

yes leaning over the table on his elbow and genially
gesturing at him with his forefinger yes and as
i said you don't remark the sting of it

i do indeed most calumnious thought frank




no humor in it

not a bit

well now charlie eying him with moist regard
let us drink it appears to me you don't drink
freely

oh oh   indeed indeed   i am not backward there
i protest a freer drinker than friend charlie you will
find nowhere with feverish zeal snatching his glass
but only in the sequel to dally with it by-the-way
frank said he perhaps or perhaps not to draw attention
from himself by-the-way i saw a good thing
the other day capital thing a panegyric on the press
it pleased me so i got it by heart at two readings it
is a kind of poetry but in a form which stands in something
the same relation to blank verse which that does
to rhyme a sort of free-and-easy chant with refrains
to it shall i recite it

anything in praise of the press i shall be happy to
hear rejoined the cosmopolitan the more so he
gravely proceeded as of late i have observed in some
quarters a disposition to disparage the press

disparage the press

even so some gloomy souls affirming that it is
proving with that great invention as with brandy or
eau-de-vie which upon its first discovery was believed
by the doctors to be as its french name implies a panacea   
a notion which experience it may be thought
has not fully verified

you surprise me frank are there really those who
so decry the press tell me more their reasons




reasons they have none but affirmations they have
many among other things affirming that while under
dynastic despotisms the press is to the people little but
an improvisatore under popular ones it is too apt to be
their jack cade in fine these sour sages regard the
press in the light of a colt's revolver pledged to no
cause but his in whose chance hands it may be deeming
the one invention an improvement upon the pen
much akin to what the other is upon the pistol involving
along with the multiplication of the barrel no consecration
of the aim the term freedom of the press
they consider on a par with freedom of colt's revolver
hence for truth and the right they hold to indulge
hopes from the one is little more sensible than for kossuth
and mazzini to indulge hopes from the other
heart-breaking views enough you think but their
refutation is in every true reformer's contempt is it
not so

without doubt but go on go on i like to hear
you flatteringly brimming up his glass for him

for one continued the cosmopolitan grandly
swelling his chest i hold the press to be neither the
people's improvisatore nor jack cade neither their
paid fool nor conceited drudge i think interest never
prevails with it over duty the press still speaks for
truth though impaled in the teeth of lies though intrenched
disdaining for it the poor name of cheap
diffuser of news i claim for it the independent apostleship
of advancer of knowledge   the iron paul
paul i say for not only does the press advance




knowledge but righteousness in the press as in the sun
resides my dear charlie a dedicated principle of beneficent
force and light for the satanic press by its
coappearance with the apostolic it is no more an aspersion
to that than to the true sun is the coappearance
of the mock one for all the baleful-looking parhelion
god apollo dispenses the day in a word charlie what
the sovereign of england is titularly i hold the press to
be actually   defender of the faith   defender of the
faith in the final triumph of truth over error metaphysics
over superstition theory over falsehood machinery
over nature and the good man over the bad such are
my views which if stated at some length you charlie
must pardon for it is a theme upon which i cannot
speak with cold brevity and now i am impatient for
your panegyric which i doubt not will put mine to
the blush

it is rather in the blush-giving vein smiled the
other but such as it is frank you shall have it

tell me when you are about to begin said the
cosmopolitan for when at public dinners the press is
toasted i always drink the toast standing and shall
stand while you pronounce the panegyric

very good frank you may stand up now

he accordingly did so when the stranger likewise
rose and uplifting the ruby wine-flask began






opening with a poetical eulogy of the press and continuing
with talk inspired by the same


praise be unto the press not faust's but noah's
let us extol and magnify the press the true press of
noah from which breaketh the true morning praise
be unto the press not the black press but the red
let us extol and magnify the press the red press of noah
from which cometh inspiration ye pressmen of the
rhineland and the rhine join in with all ye who tread
out the glad tidings on isle madeira or mitylene   who
giveth redness of eyes by making men long to tarry at
the fine print   praise be unto the press the rosy press
of noah which giveth rosiness of hearts by making men
long to tarry at the rosy wine   who hath babblings and
contentions who without cause inflicteth wounds
praise be unto the press the kindly press of noah
which knitteth friends which fuseth foes   who may be
bribed   who may be bound   praise be unto the press
the free press of noah which will not lie for tyrants
but make tyrants speak the truth   then praise be unto
the press the frank old press of noah then let us
extol and magnify the press the brave old press of noah




then let us with roses garland and enwreath the press
the grand old press of noah from which flow streams of
knowledge which give man a bliss no more unreal than
his pain

you deceived me smiled the cosmopolitan as both
now resumed their seats you roguishly took advantage
of my simplicity you archly played upon my enthusiasm
but never mind the offense if any was so charming
i almost wish you would offend again as for certain
poetic left-handers in your panegyric those i cheerfully
concede to the indefinite privileges of the poet upon
the whole it was quite in the lyric style   a style i always
admire on account of that spirit of sibyllic confidence
and assurance which is perhaps its prime ingredient
but come glancing at his companion's glass for a
lyrist you let the bottle stay with you too long

the lyre and the vine forever cried the other in
his rapture or what seemed such heedless of the hint
the vine the vine is it not the most graceful and
bounteous of all growths and by its being such is
not something meant   divinely meant as i live a
vine a catawba vine shall be planted on my grave

a genial thought but your glass there

oh oh taking a moderate sip but you why don't
you drink

you have forgotten my dear charlie what i told
you of my previous convivialities to-day

oh cried the other now in manner quite abandoned
to the lyric mood not without contrast to the easy
sociability of his companion oh one can't drink too




much of good old wine   the genuine mellow old port
pooh pooh drink away

then keep me company

of course with a flourish taking another sip   
suppose we have cigars never mind your pipe there
a pipe is best when alone i say waiter bring some
cigars   your best

they were brought in a pretty little bit of western
pottery representing some kind of indian utensil mummy-colored
set down in a mass of tobacco leaves whose
long green fans fancifully grouped formed with peeps
of red the sides of the receptacle

accompanying it were two accessories also bits of
pottery but smaller both globes one in guise of an
apple flushed with red and gold to the life and through
a cleft at top you saw it was hollow this was for the
ashes the other gray with wrinkled surface in the
likeness of a wasp's nest was the match-box

there said the stranger pushing over the cigarstand
help yourself and i will touch you off taking
a match nothing like tobacco he added when the
fumes of the cigar began to wreathe glancing from the
smoker to the pottery i will have a virginia tobaccoplant
set over my grave beside the catawba vine

improvement upon your first idea which by itself
was good   but you don't smoke

presently presently   let me fill your glass again
you don't drink

thank you but no more just now fill your
glass




presently presently do you drink on never
mind me now that it strikes me let me say that he
who out of superfine gentility or fanatic morality
denies himself tobacco suffers a more serious abatement
in the cheap pleasures of life than the dandy in his iron
boot or the celibate on his iron cot while for him
who would fain revel in tobacco but cannot it is a thing
at which philanthropists must weep to see such an one
again and again madly returning to the cigar which
for his incompetent stomach he cannot enjoy while
still after each shameful repulse the sweet dream of
the impossible good goads him on to his fierce misery
once more   poor eunuch

i agree with you said the cosmopolitan still gravely
social but you don't smoke

presently presently do you smoke on as i was
saying about   

but why don't you smoke   come you don't think
that tobacco when in league with wine too much enhances
the latter's vinous quality   in short with certain
constitutions tends to impair self-possession do you

to think that were treason to good fellowship
was the warm disclaimer no no but the fact is
there is an unpropitious flavor in my mouth just now
ate of a diabolical ragout at dinner so i shan't smoke
till i have washed away the lingering memento of it
with wine but smoke away you and pray don't
forget to drink by-the-way while we sit here so
companionably giving loose to any companionable
nothing your uncompanionable friend coonskins is by




pure contrast brought to recollection if he were but
here now he would see how much of real heart-joy he
denies himself by not hob-a-nobbing with his kind

why with loitering emphasis slowly withdrawing
his cigar i thought i had undeceived you there i
thought you had come to a better understanding of my
eccentric friend

well i thought so too but first impressions will
return you know in truth now that i think of it i
am led to conjecture from chance things which dropped
from coonskins during the little interview i had with
him that he is not a missourian by birth but years ago
came west here a young misanthrope from the other
side of the alleghanies less to make his fortune than to
flee man now since they say trifles sometimes effect
great results i shouldn't wonder if his history were
probed it would be found that what first indirectly gave
his sad bias to coonskins was his disgust at reading in boyhood
the advice of polonius to laertes   advice which in
the selfishness it inculcates is almost on a par with a sort
of ballad upon the economies of money-making to be
occasionally seen pasted against the desk of small retail
traders in new england

i do hope now my dear fellew said the cosmopolitan
with an air of bland protest that in my presence
at least you will throw out nothing to the prejudice of
the sons of the puritans

hey-day and high times indeed exclaimed the
other nettled sons of the puritans forsooth and
who be puritans that i an alabamaian must do them




reverence a set of sourly conceited old malvolios
whom shakespeare laughs his fill at in his comedies

pray what were you about to suggest with regard
to polonius observed the cosmopolitan with quiet forbearance
expressive of the patience of a superior mind
at the petulance of an inferior one how do you characterize
his advice to laertes

as false fatal and calumnious exclaimed the other
with a degree of ardor befitting one resenting a stigma
upon the family escutcheon and for a father to give
his son   monstrous the case you see is this the son
is going abroad and for the first what does the father
invoke god's blessing upon him put the blessed bible
in his trunk no crams him with maxims smacking
of my lord chesterfield with maxims of france with
maxims of italy

no no be charitable not that why does he not
among other things say   


the friends thou hast and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel

is that compatible with maxims of italy

yes it is frank don't you see laertes is to
take the best of care of his friends   his proved friends
on the same principal that a wine-corker takes the best
of care of his proved bottles when a bottle gets a
sharp knock and don't break he says ah i'll keep that
bottle why because he loves it no he has particular
use for it




dear dear appealingly turning in distress that   
that kind of criticism is   is   in fact   it won't do

won't truth do frank you are so charitable with
everybody do but consider the tone of the speech
now i put it to you frank is there anything in it
hortatory to high heroic disinterested effort anything
like sell all thou hast and give to the poor and
in other points what desire seems most in the father's
mind that his son should cherish nobleness for himself
or be on his guard against the contrary thing in others
an irreligious warner frank   no devout counselor is
polonius i hate him nor can i bear to hear your
veterans of the world affirm that he who steers through
life by the advice of old polonius will not steer among
the breakers

no no   i hope nobody affirms that rejoined the
cosmopolitan with tranquil abandonment sideways reposing
his arm at full length upon the table i hope
nobody affirms that because if polonius advice be
taken in your sense then the recommendation of it by
men of experience would appear to involve more or less
of an unhandsome sort of reflection upon human nature
and yet with a perplexed air your suggestions have
put things in such a strange light to me as in fact a
little to disturb my previous notions of polonius and
what he says to be frank by your ingenuity you have
unsettled me there to that degree that were it not for
our coincidence of opinion in general i should almost
think i was now at length beginning to feel the ill effect
of an immature mind too much consorting with a




mature one except on the ground of first principles in
common

really and truly cried the other with a kind of
tickled modesty and pleased concern mine is an understanding
too weak to throw out grapnels and hug another
to it i have indeed heard of some great scholars
in these days whose boast is less that they have made
disciples than victims but for me had i the power to
do such things i have not the heart to desire

i believe you my dear charlie and yet i repeat
by your commentaries on polonius you have i know
not how unsettled me so that now i don't exactly see
how shakespeare meant the words he puts in polonius
mouth

some say that he meant them to open people's eyes
but i don't think so

open their eyes echoed the cosmopolitan slowly
expanding his what is there in this world for one to
open his eyes to i mean in the sort of invidious sense
you cite

well others say he meant to corrupt people's morals
and still others that he had no express intention at
all but in effect opens their eyes and corrupts their
morals in one operation all of which i reject

of course you reject so crude an hypothesis and yet
to confess in reading shakespeare in my closet struck
by some passage i have laid down the volume and said
this shakespeare is a queer man at times seeming
irresponsible he does not always seem reliable there
appears to be a certain   what shall i call it   hidden




sun say about him at once enlightening and mystifying
now i should be afraid to say what i have sometimes
thought that hidden sun might be

do you think it was the true light with clandestine
geniality again filling the other's glass

i would prefer to decline answering a categorical
question there shakespeare has got to be a kind of
deity prudent minds having certain latent thoughts
concerning him will reserve them in a condition of lasting
probation still as touching avowable speculations
we are permitted a tether shakespeare himself is to be
adored not arraigned but so we do it with humility we
may a little canvass his characters there's his autolycus
now a fellow that always puzzled me how is one
to take autolycus a rogue so happy so lucky so
triumphant of so almost captivatingly vicious a career
that a virtuous man reduced to the poor-house were
such a contingency conceivable might almost long to
change sides with him and yet see the words put into
his mouth oh cries autolycus as he comes galloping
gay as a buck upon the stage oh he laughs oh what
a fool is honesty and trust his sworn brother a very
simple gentleman think of that trust that is confidence   
that is the thing in this universe the sacredest   
is rattingly pronounced just the simplest and the
scenes in which the rogue figures seem purposely devised
for verification of his principles mind charlie i
do not say it is so far from it but i do say it seems so
yes autolycus would seem a needy varlet acting upon
the persuasion that less is to be got by invoking pockets




than picking them more to be made by an expert knave
than a bungling beggar and for this reason as he
thinks that the soft heads outnumber the soft hearts
the devil's drilled recruit autolycus is joyous as if he
wore the livery of heaven when disturbed by the
character and career of one thus wicked and thus happy
my sole consolation is in the fact that no such creature
ever existed except in the powerful imagination which
evoked him and yet a creature a living creature he
is though only a poet was his maker it may be that
in that paper-and-ink investiture of his autolycus acts
more effectively upon mankind than he would in a flesh-and-blood
one can his influence be salutary true
in autolycus there is humor but though according to
my principle humor is in general to be held a saving
quality yet the case of autolycus is an exception
because it is his humor which so to speak oils his
mischievousness the bravadoing mischievousness of
autolycus is slid into the world on humor as a pirate
schooner with colors flying is launched into the sea on
greased ways

i approve of autolycus as little as you said the
stranger who during his companion's commonplaces
had seemed less attentive to them than to maturing with
in his own mind the original conceptions destined to
eclipse them but i cannot believe that autolycus
mischievous as he must prove upon the stage can be
near so much so as such a character as polonius

i don't know about that bluntly and yet not
impolitely returned the cosmopolitan to be sure




accepting your view of the old courtier then if between
him and autolycus you raise the question of unprepossessingness
i grant you the latter comes off best for a
moist rogue may tickle the midriff while a dry worldling
may but wrinkle the spleen

but polonius is not dry said the other excitedly
he drules one sees the fly-blown old fop drule and
look wise his vile wisdom is made the viler by his
vile rheuminess the bowing and cringing time-serving
old sinner   is such an one to give manly precepts to
youth the discreet decorous old dotard-of-state
senile prudence fatuous soullessness the ribanded
old dog is paralytic all down one side and that the side
of nobleness his soul is gone out only nature's automatonism
keeps him on his legs as with some old
trees the bark survives the pith and will still stand
stiffly up though but to rim round punk so the body
of old polonius has outlived his soul

come come said the cosmopolitan with serious air
almost displeased though i yield to none in admiration
of earnestness yet i think even earnestness may have
limits to human minds strong language is always
more or less distressing besides polonius is an old
man   as i remember him upon the stage   with snowy
locks now charity requires that such a figure   think
of it how you will   should at least be treated with
civility moreover old age is ripeness and i once
heard say better ripe than raw

but not better rotten than raw bringing down his
hand with energy on the table




why bless me in mild surprise contemplating his
heated comrade how you fly out against this unfortunate
polonius   a being that never was nor will be
and yet viewed in a christian light he added pensively
i don't know that anger against this man of straw
is a whit less wise than anger against a man of flesh
madness to be mad with anything

that may be or may not be returned the other a
little testily perhaps but i stick to what i said that
it is better to be raw than rotten and what is to be
feared on that head may be known from this that it is
with the best of hearts as with the best of pears   a dangerous
experiment to linger too long upon the scene
this did polonius thank fortune frank i am young
every tooth sound in my head and if good wine can
keep me where i am long shall i remain so

true with a smile but wine to do good must
be drunk you have talked much and well charlie
but drunk little and indifferently   fill up

presently presently with a hasty and preoccupied
air if i remember right polonius hints as much as
that one should under no circumstances commit the indiscretion
of aiding in a pecuniary way an unfortunate
friend he drules out some stale stuff about loan losing
both itself and friend don't he but our bottle is it
glued fast keep it moving my dear frank good
wine and upon my soul i begin to feel it and through
me old polonius   yes this wine i fear is what excites
me so against that detestable old dog without a tooth

upon this the cosmopolitan cigar in mouth slowly




raised the bottle and brought it slowly to the light
looking at it steadfastly as one might at a thermometer
in august to see not how low it was but how high
then whiffing out a puff set it down and said well
charlie if what wine you have drunk came out of this
bottle in that case i should say that if   supposing a
case   that if one fellow had an object in getting another
fellow fuddled and this fellow to be fuddled was of
your capacity the operation would be comparatively
inexpensive what do you think charlie

why i think i don't much admire the supposition
said charlie with a look of resentment it ain't safe
depend upon it frank to venture upon too jocose suppositions
with one's friends

why bless you frank my supposition wasn't personal
but general you mustn't be so touchy

if i am touchy it is the wine sometimes when i
freely drink it it has a touchy effect on me i have observed

freely drink you haven't drunk the perfect measure
of one glass yet while for me this must be my
fourth or fifth thanks to your importunity not to speak
of all i drank this morning for old acquaintance sake
drink drink you must drink

oh i drink while you are talking laughed the
other you have not noticed it but i have drunk my
share have a queer way i learned from a sedate old
uncle who used to tip off his glass unperceived do
you fill up and my glass too there now away
with that stump and have a new cigar good




fellowship forever again in the lyric mood say frank
are we not men i say are we not human tell me
were they not human who engendered us as before
heaven i believe they shall be whom we shall engender
fill up up up my friend let the ruby tide aspire
and all ruby aspirations with it up fill up be we
convivial and conviviality what is it the word i
mean what expresses it a living together but
bats live together and did you ever hear of convivial
bats

if i ever did observed the cosmopolitan it has
quite slipped my recollection

but why did you never hear of convivial bats nor
anybody else because bats though they live together
live not together genially bats are not genial souls
but men are and how delightful to think that the word
which among men signifies the highest pitch of geniality
implies as indispensable auxiliary the cheery
benediction of the bottle yes frank to live together
in the finest sense we must drink together and so
what wonder that he who loves not wine that sober
wretch has a lean heart   a heart like a wrung-out old
bluing-bag and loves not his kind out upon him to
the rag-house with him hang him   the ungenial
soul

oh now now can't you be convivial without being
censorious i like easy unexcited conviviality for
the sober man really though for my part i naturally
love a cheerful glass i will not prescribe my nature as
the law to other natures so don't abuse the sober




man conviviality is one good thing and sobriety is
another good thing so don't be one-sided

well if i am one-sided it is the wine indeed indeed
i have indulged too genially my excitement
upon slight provocation shows it but yours is a
stronger head drink you by the way talking of geniality
it is much on the increase in these days ain't
it

it is and i hail the fact nothing better attests
the advance of the humanitarian spirit in former and
less humanitarian ages   the ages of amphitheatres and
gladiators   geniality was mostly confined to the fireside
and table but in our age   the age of joint-stock companies
and free-and-easies   it is with this precious
quality as with precious gold in old peru which pizarro
found making up the scullion's sauce-pot as the inca's
crown yes we golden boys the moderns have geniality
everwhere   a bounty broadcast like noonlight

true true my sentiments again geniality has
invaded each department and profession we have genial
senators genial authors genial lecturers genial
doctors genial clergymen genial surgeons and the next
thing we shall have genial hangmen

as to the last-named sort of person said the cosmopolitan
i trust that the advancing spirit of geniality
will at last enable us to dispense with him no murderers   
no hangmen and surely when the whole
world shall have been genialized it will be as out of
place to talk of murderers as in a christianized world
to talk of sinners




to pursue the thought said the other every
blessing is attended with some evil and   

stay said the cosmopolitan that may be better
let pass for a loose saying than for hopeful doctrine

well assuming the saying's truth it would apply
to the future supremacy of the genial spirit since then
it will fare with the hangman as it did with the weaver
when the spinning-jenny whizzed into the ascendant
thrown out of employment what could jack ketch
turn his hand to butchering

that he could turn his hand to it seems probable
but that under the circumstances it would be appropriate
might in some minds admit of a question for one
i am inclined to think   and i trust it will not be held
fastidiousness   that it would hardly be suitable to the
dignity of our nature that an individual once employed
in attending the last hours of human unfortunates
should that office being extinct transfer himself to the
business of attending the last hours of unfortunate cattle
i would suggest that the individual turn valet   a
vocation to which he would perhaps appear not wholly
inadapted by his familiar dexterity about the person in
particular for giving a finishing tie to a gentleman's
cravat i know few who would in all likelihood be
from previous occupation better fitted than the professional
person in question

are you in earnest regarding the serene speaker
with unaffected curiosity are you really in earnest

i trust i am never otherwise was the mildly earnest
reply but talking of the advance of geniality i




am not without hopes that it will eventually exert its
influence even upon so difficult a subject as the misanthrope

a genial misanthrope i thought i had stretched
the rope pretty hard in talking of genial hangmen a
genial misanthrope is no more conceivable than a surly
philanthropist

true lightly depositing in an unbroken little
cylinder the ashes of his cigar true the two you
name are well opposed

why you talk as if there was such a being as a
surly philanthropist

i do my eccentric friend whom you call coonskins
is an example does he not as i explained to
you hide under a surly air a philanthropic heart
now the genial misanthrope when in the process of
eras he shall turn up will be the converse of this under
an affable air he will hide a misanthropical heart
in short the genial misanthrope will be a new kind of
monster but still no small improvement upon the original
one since instead of making faces and throwing
stones at people like that poor old crazy man timon
he will take steps fiddle in hand and set the tickled
world a dancing in a word as the progress of christianization
mellows those in manner whom it cannot
mend in mind much the same will it prove with the
progress of genialization and so thanks to geniality
the misanthrope reclaimed from his boorish address will
take on refinement and softness   to so genial a degree
indeed that it may possibly fall out that the misanthrope




of the coming century will be almost as popular as i
am sincerely sorry to say some philanthropists of the
present time would seem not to be as witness my eccentric
friend named before

well cried the other a little weary perhaps of a
speculation so abstract well however it may be with
the century to come certainly in the century which is
whatever else one may be he must be genial or he is
nothing so fill up fill up and be genial

i am trying my best said the cosmopolitan still
calmly companionable a moment since we talked
of pizarro gold and peru no doubt now you remember
that when the spaniard first entered atahalpa's treasure-chamber
and saw such profusion of plate stacked
up right and left with the wantonness of old barrels in
a brewer's yard the needy fellow felt a twinge of misgiving
of want of confidence as to the genuineness of
an opulence so profuse he went about rapping the
shining vases with his knuckles but it was all gold
pure gold good gold sterling gold which how cheerfully
would have been stamped such at goldsmiths
hall and just so those needy minds which through
their own insincerity having no confidence in mankind
doubt lest the liberal geniality of this age be spurious
they are small pizarros in their way   by the
very princeliness of men's geniality stunned into distrust
of it

far be such distrust from you and me my genial
friend cried the other fervently fill up fill up

well this all along seems a division of labor




smiled the cosmopolitan i do about all the drinking
and you do about all   the genial but yours is a nature
competent to do that to a large population and now
my friend with a peculiarly grave air evidently foreshadowing
something not unimportant and very likely
of close personal interest wine you know opens the
heart and   

opens it with exultation it thaws it right out
every heart is ice-bound till wine melt it and reveal the
tender grass and sweet herbage budding below with
every dear secret hidden before like a dropped jewel in a
snow-bank lying there unsuspected through winter till
spring

and just in that way my dear charlie is one of
my little secrets now to be shown forth

ah eagerly moving round his chair what is it

be not so impetuous my dear charlie let me
explain you see naturally i am a man not overgifted
with assurance in general i am if anything diffidently
reserved so if i shall presently seem otherwise the reason
is that you by the geniality you have evinced in all
your talk and especially the noble way in which while
affirming your good opinion of men you intimated that
you never could prove false to any man but most by
your indignation at a particularly illiberal passage in
polonius advice   in short in short with extreme embarrassment
how shall i express what i mean unless
i add that by your whole character you impel me to
throw myself upon your nobleness in one word put
confidence in you a generous confidence




i see i see with heightened interest something
of moment you wish to confide now what is it
frank love affair

no not that

what then my dear frank speak   depend upon
me to the last out with it

out it shall come then said the cosmopolitan
i am in want urgent want of money






a metamorphosis more suprising than any in ovid


 in want of money pushing back his chair as
from a suddenly-disclosed man-trap or crater

yes navely assented the cosmopolitan and you
are going to loan me fifty dollars i could almost wish
i was in need of more only for your sake yes my
dear charlie for your sake that you might the better
prove your noble kindliness my dear charlie

none of your dear charlies cried the other
springing to his feet and buttoning up his coat as if
hastily to depart upon a long journey

why why why painfully looking up

none of your why why whys tossing out a foot
go to the devil sir beggar impostor   never so
deceived in a man in my life






showing that the age of magic and magicians is not yet over


while speaking or rather hissing those words the
boon companion underwent much such a change as one
reads of in fairy-books out of old materials sprang a
new creature cadmus glided into the snake

the cosmopolitan rose the traces of previous feeling
vanished looked steadfastly at his transformed friend a
moment then taking ten half-eagles from his pocket
stooped down and laid them one by one in a circle
round him and retiring a pace waved his long tasseled
pipe with the air of a necromancer an air heightened
by his costume accompanying each wave with a solemn
murmur of cabalistical words

meantime he within the magic-ring stood suddenly
rapt exhibiting every symptom of a successful charm   
a turned cheek a fixed attitude a frozen eye spellbound
not more by the waving wand than by the ten
invincible talismans on the floor

reappear reappear reappear oh my former friend
replace this hideous apparition with thy blest shape
and be the token of thy return the words my dear
frank




my dear frank now cried the restored friend
cordially stepping out of the ring with regained self-possession
regaining lost identity my dear frank
what a funny man you are full of fun as an egg of
meat how could you tell me that absurd story of
your being in need but i relish a good joke too well
to spoil it by letting on of course i humored the
thing and on my side put on all the cruel airs you
would have me come this little episode of fictitious
estrangement will but enhance the delightful reality
let us sit down again and finish our bottle

with all my heart said the cosmopolitan dropping
the necromancer with the same facility with which he
had assumed it yes he added soberly picking
up the gold pieces and returning them with a chink to
his pocket yes i am something of a funny man now
and then while for you charlie eying him in tenderness
what you say about your humoring the thing is
true enough never did man second a joke better than
you did just now you played your part better than i
did mine you played it charlie to the life

you see i once belonged to an amateur play
company that accounts for it but come fill up
and let's talk of something else

well acquiesced the cosmopolitan seating himself
and quietly brimming his glass what shall we talk
about

oh anything you please a sort of nervously
accommodating

well suppose we talk about charlemont




charlemont what's charlemont who's charlemont

you shall hear my dear charlie answered the
cosmopolitan i will tell you the story of charlemont
the gentleman-madman






which may pass for whatever it may prove to be worth


but ere be given the rather grave story of charlemont
a reply must in civility be made to a certain voice
which methinks i hear that in view of past chapters
and more particularly the last where certain antics appear
exclaims how unreal all this is who did ever
dress or act like your cosmopolitan and who it
might be returned did ever dress or act like harlequin

strange that in a work of amusement this severe
fidelity to real life should be exacted by any one who
by taking up such a work sufficiently shows that he is
not unwilling to drop real life and turn for a time to
something different yes it is indeed strange that any
one should clamor for the thing he is weary of that any
one who for any cause finds real life dull should yet
demand of him who is to divert his attention from it
that he should be true to that dullness

there is another class and with this class we side
who sit down to a work of amusement tolerantly as they
sit at a play and with much the same expectations and
feelings they look that fancy shall evoke scenes different
from those of the same old crowd round the




customhouse counter and same old dishes on the boardinghouse
table with characters unlike those of the same
old acquaintances they meet in the same old way every
day in the same old street and as in real life the proprieties
will not allow people to act out themselves with
that unreserve permitted to the stage so in books of
fiction they look not only for more entertainment but
at bottom even for more reality than real life itself can
show thus though they want novelty they want
nature too but nature unfettered exhilarated in effect
transformed in this way of thinking the people in a
fiction like the people in a play must dress as nobody
exactly dresses talk as nobody exactly talks act as
nobody exactly acts it is with fiction as with religion
it should present another world and yet one to which
we feel the tie

if then something is to be pardoned to well-meant
endeavor surely a little is to be allowed to that writer
who in all his scenes does but seek to minister to what
as he understands it is the implied wish of the more
indulgent lovers of entertainment before whom harlequin
can never appear in a coat too parti-colored or cut
capers too fantastic

one word more though every one knows how
bootless it is to be in all cases vindicating one's self never
mind how convinced one may be that he is never in the
wrong yet so precious to man is the approbation of
his kind that to rest though but under an imaginary
censure applied to but a work of imagination is no easy
thing the mention of this weakness will explain why




all such readers as may think they perceive something
inharmonious between the boisterous hilarity of the
cosmopolitan with the bristling cynic and his restrained
good-nature with the boon-companion are now referred
to that chapter where some similar apparent inconsistency
in another character is on general principles
modestly endeavored to be apologized for







in which the cosmopolitan tells the story of the gentlemanmadman


 charlemont was a young merchant of french
descent living in st louis   a man not deficient in
mind and possessed of that sterling and captivating
kindliness seldom in perfection seen but in youthful
bachelors united at times to a remarkable sort of gracefully
devil-may-care and witty good-humor of course he
was admired by everybody and loved as only mankind
can love by not a few but in his twenty-ninth year
a change came over him like one whose hair turns
gray in a night so in a day charlemont turned from
affable to morose his acquaintances were passed without
greeting while as for his confidential friends them
he pointedly unscrupulously and with a kind of fierceness
cut dead

one provoked by such conduct would fain have
resented it with words as disdainful while another
shocked by the change and in concern for a friend
magnanimously overlooking affronts implored to know
what sudden secret grief had distempered him but




from resentment and from tenderness charlemont alike
turned away

ere long to the general surprise the merchant
charlemont was gazetted and the same day it was reported
that he had withdrawn from town but not
before placing his entire property in the hands of responsible
assigness for the benefit of creditors

whither he had vanished none could guess at
length nothing being heard it was surmised that he
must have made away with himself   a surmise doubtless
originating in the remembrance of the change some
months previous to his bankruptcy   a change of a sort
only to be ascribed to a mind suddenly thrown from its
balance

years passed it was spring-time and lo one
bright morning charlemont lounged into the st louis
coffee-houses   gay polite humane companionable and
dressed in the height of costly elegance not only was
he alive but he was himself again upon meeting with
old acquaintances he made the first advances and in
such a manner that it was impossible not to meet him
half-way upon other old friends whom he did not
chance casually to meet he either personally called or
left his card and compliments for them and to several
sent presents of game or hampers of wine

they say the world is sometimes harshly unforgiving
but it was not so to charlemont the world
feels a return of love for one who returns to it as he
did expressive of its renewed interest was a whisper
an inquiring whisper how now exactly so long after




his bankruptcy it fared with charlemont's purse
rumor seldom at a loss for answers replied that he had
spent nine years in marseilles in france and there acquiring
a second fortune had returned with it a man
devoted henceforth to genial friendships

added years went by and the restored wanderer
still the same or rather by his noble qualities grew up
like golden maize in the encouraging sun of good
opinions but still the latent wonder was what had
caused that change in him at a period when pretty much
as now he was to all appearance in the possession of
the same fortune the same friends the same popularity
but nobody thought it would be the thing to question
him here

at last at a dinner at his house when all the guests
but one had successively departed this remaining
guest an old acquaintance being just enough under
the influence of wine to set aside the fear of touching
upon a delicate point ventured in a way which perhaps
spoke more favorably for his heart than his tact to beg
of his host to explain the one enigma of his life deep
melancholy overspread the before cheery face of charlemont
he sat for some moments tremulously silent then
pushing a full decanter towards the guest in a choked
voice said no no when by art and care and time
flowers are made to bloom over a grave who would
seek to dig all up again only to know the mystery   
the wine when both glasses were filled charlemont
took his and lifting it added lowly if ever in days
to come you shall see ruin at hand and thinking you




understand mankind shall tremble for your friendships
and tremble for your pride and partly through love
for the one and fear for the other shall resolve to be
beforehand with the world and save it from a sin by
prospectively taking that sin to yourself then will you
do as one i now dream of once did and like him will
you suffer but how fortunate and how grateful should
you be if like him after all that had happened you
could be a little happy again

when the guest went away it was with the persuasion
that though outwardly restored in mind as in
fortune yet some taint of charlemont's old malady
survived and that it was not well for friends to touch
one dangerous string






in which the cosmopolitan strikingly evinces the artlessness
of his nature


 well what do you think of the story of charlemont
mildly asked he who had told it

a very strange one answered the auditor who had
been such not with perfect ease but is it true

of course not it is a story which i told with
the purpose of every story-teller   to amuse hence if
it seem strange to you that strangeness is the romance
it is what contrasts it with real life it is the invention
in brief the fiction as opposed to the fact for do but
ask yourself my dear charlie lovingly leaning over towards
him i rest it with your own heart now whether
such a forereaching motive as charlemont hinted
he had acted on in his change   whether such a motive
i say were a sort of one at all justified by the nature
of human society would you for one turn the
cold shoulder to a friend   a convivial one say whose
pennilessness should be suddenly revealed to you

how can you ask me my dear frank you know
i would scorn such meanness but rising somewhat
disconcerted   really early as it is i think i must




retire my head putting up his hand to it feels unpleasantly
this confounded elixir of logwood little as i
drank of it has played the deuce with me

little as you drank of this elixir of logwood why
charlie you are losing your mind to talk so of the
genuine mellow old port yes i think that by all
means you had better away and sleep it off there   
don't apologize   don't explain   go go   i understand
you exactly i will see you to-morrow






in which the cosmopolitan is accosted by a mystic whereupon
ensues pretty much such talk as might be expected


as not without some haste the boon companion withdrew
a stranger advanced and touching the cosmopolitan
said i think i heard you say you would see that
man again be warned don't you do so

he turned surveying the speaker a blue-eyed man
sandy-haired and saxon-looking perhaps five and
forty tall and but for a certain angularity well made
little touch of the drawing-room about him but a look of
plain propriety of a puritan sort with a kind of farmer
dignity his age seemed betokened more by his brow
placidly thoughtful than by his general aspect which
had that look of youthfulness in maturity peculiar
sometimes to habitual health of body the original gift
of nature or in part the effect or reward of steady temperance
of the passions kept so perhaps by constitution
as much as morality a neat comely almost
ruddy cheek coolly fresh like a red clover-blossom at
coolish dawn   the color of warmth preserved by the
virtue of chill toning the whole man was one-knows-not-what
of shrewdness and mythiness strangely




jumbled in that way he seemed a kind of cross between
a yankee peddler and a tartar priest though it seemed
as if at a pinch the first would not in all probability
play second fiddle to the last

sir said the cosmopolitan rising and bowing with
slow dignity if i cannot with unmixed satisfaction
hail a hint pointed at one who has just been clinking
the social glass with me on the other hand i am not
disposed to underrate the motive which in the present
case could alone have prompted such an intimation
my friend whose seat is still warm has retired for the
night leaving more or less in his bottle here pray sit
down in his seat and partake with me and then if
you choose to hint aught further unfavorable to the man
the genial warmth of whose person in part passes into
yours and whose genial hospitality meanders through
you   be it so

quite beautiful conceits said the stranger now
scholastically and artistically eying the picturesque
speaker as if he were a statue in the pitti palace
very beautiful then with the gravest interest
yours sir if i mistake not must be a beautiful soul   
one full of all love and truth for where beauty is
there must those be

a pleasing belief rejoined the cosmopolitan beginning
with an even air and to confess long ago it
pleased me yes with you and schiller i am pleased
to believe that beauty is at bottom incompatible with
ill and therefore am so eccentric as to have confidence
in the latent benignity of that beautiful creature the




rattle-snake whose lithe neck and burnished maze of
tawny gold as he sleekly curls aloft in the sun who on
the prairie can behold without wonder

as he breathed these words he seemed so to enter
into their spirit   as some earnest descriptive speakers
will   as unconsciously to wreathe his form and sidelong
crest his head till he all but seemed the creature described
meantime the stranger regarded him with
little surprise apparently though with much contemplativeness
of a mystical sort and presently said
when charmed by the beauty of that viper did it
never occur to you to change personalities with him
to feel what it was to be a snake to glide unsuspected
in grass to sting to kill at a touch your whole beautiful
body one iridescent scabbard of death in short
did the wish never occur to you to feel yourself exempt
from knowledge and conscience and revel for a while
in the care-free joyous life of a perfectly instinctive
unscrupulous and irresponsible creature

such a wish replied the other not perceptibly
disturbed i must confess never consciously was
mine such a wish indeed could hardly occur to ordinary
imaginations and mine i cannot think much
above the average

but now that the idea is suggested said the
stranger with infantile intellectuality does it not
raise the desire

hardly for though i do not think i have any uncharitable
prejudice against the rattle-snake still i
should not like to be one if i were a rattle-snake now




there would be no such thing as being genial with men   
men would be afraid of me and then i should be a very
lonesome and miserable rattle-snake

true men would be afraid of you and why
because of your rattle your hollow rattle   a sound as
i have been told like the shaking together of small dry
skulls in a tune of the waltz of death and here we
have another beautiful truth when any creature is by
its make inimical to other creatures nature in effect
labels that creature much as an apothecary does a
poison so that whoever is destroyed by a rattle-snake
or other harmful agent it is his own fault he should
have respected the label hence that significant passage
in scripture who will pity the charmer that is
bitten with a serpent

 i would pity him said the cosmopolitan a little
bluntly perhaps

but don't you think rejoined the other still maintaining
his passionless air don't you think that for a
man to pity where nature is pitiless is a little presuming

let casuists decide the casuistry but the compassion
the heart decides for itself but sir deepening in
seriousness as i now for the first realize you but a
moment since introduced the word irresponsible in a
way i am not used to now sir though out of a tolerant
spirit as i hope i try my best never to be
frightened at any speculation so long as it is pursued in
honesty yet for once i must acknowledge that you do
really in the point cited cause me uneasiness because




a proper view of the universe that view which is suited
to breed a proper confidence teaches if i err not that
since all things are justly presided over not very many
living agents but must be some way accountable

is a rattle-snake accountable asked the stranger
with such a preternaturally cold gemmy glance out of
his pellucid blue eye that he seemed more a metaphysical
merman than a feeling man is a rattle-snake
accountable

if i will not affirm that it is returned the other
with the caution of no inexperienced thinker neither
will i deny it but if we suppose it so i need not say
that such accountability is neither to you nor me nor
the court of common pleas but to something superior

he was proceeding when the stranger would have
interrupted him but as reading his argument in his eye
the cosmopolitan without waiting for it to be put into
words at once spoke to it you object to my supposition
for but such it is that the rattle-snake's
accountability is not by nature manifest but might not
much the same thing be urged against man's a
reductio ad absurdum proving the objection vain but
if now he continued you consider what capacity
for mischief there is in a rattle-snake observe i do not
charge it with being mischievous i but say it has the
capacity could you well avoid admitting that that
would be no symmetrical view of the universe which
should maintain that while to man it is forbidden to
kill without judicial cause his fellow yet the




rattlesnake has an implied permit of unaccountability to
murder any creature it takes capricious umbrage at   man
included   but with a wearied air this is no genial
talk at least it is not so to me zeal at unawares embarked
me in it i regret it pray sit down and take
some of this wine

your suggestions are new to me said the other
with a kind of condescending appreciativeness as of
one who out of devotion to knowledge disdains not to
appropriate the least crumb of it even from a pauper's
board and as i am a very athenian in hailing a new
thought i cannot consent to let it drop so abruptly
now the rattle-snake   

nothing more about rattle-snakes i beseech in
distress i must positively decline to renter upon
that subject sit down sir i beg and take some of this
wine

to invite me to sit down with you is hospitable
collectedly acquiescing now in the change of topics
and hospitality being fabled to be of oriental origin
and forming as it does the subject of a pleasing arabian
romance as well as being a very romantic thing in itself   
hence i always hear the expressions of hospitality
with pleasure but as for the wine my regard for
that beverage is so extreme and i am so fearful of letting
it sate me that i keep my love for it in the lasting
condition of an untried abstraction briefly i quaff
immense draughts of wine from the page of hafiz but
wine from a cup i seldom as much as sip

the cosmopolitan turned a mild glance upon the




speaker who now occupying the chair opposite him sat
there purely and coldly radiant as a prism it seemed
as if one could almost hear him vitreously chime and
ring that moment a waiter passed whom arresting
with a sign the cosmopolitan bid go bring a goblet of
ice-water ice it well waiter said he and now
turning to the stranger will you if you please give
me your reason for the warning words you first addressed
to me

i hope they were not such warnings as most warnings
are said the stranger warnings which do not
forewarn but in mockery come after the fact and yet
something in you bids me think now that whatever
latent design your impostor friend might have had upon
you it as yet remains unaccomplished you read his
label

and what did it say this is a genial soul so
you see you must either give up your doctrine of labels
or else your prejudice against my friend but tell me
with renewed earnestness what do you take him for
what is he

what are you what am i nobody knows who
anybody is the data which life furnishes towards
forming a true estimate of any being are as insufficient
to that end as in geometry one side given would be to
determine the triangle

but is not this doctrine of triangles someway inconsistent
with your doctrine of labels

yes but what of that i seldom care to be consistent
in a philosophical view consistency is a certain




level at all times maintained in all the thoughts of
one's mind but since nature is nearly all hill and
dale how can one keep naturally advancing in knowledge
without submitting to the natural inequalities in
the progress advance into knowledge is just like
advance upon the grand erie canal where from the
character of the country change of level is inevitable
you are locked up and locked down with perpetual
inconsistencies and yet all the time you get on while
the dullest part of the whole route is what the boatmen
call the long level   a consistently-flat surface of sixty
miles through stagnant swamps

in one particular rejoined the cosmopolitan your
simile is perhaps unfortunate for after all these
weary lockings-up and lockings-down upon how much
of a higher plain do you finally stand enough to make
it an object having from youth been taught reverence
for knowledge you must pardon me if on but this one
account i reject your analogy but really you someway
bewitch me with your tempting discourse so that
i keep straying from my point unawares you tell me
you cannot certainly know who or what my friend is
pray what do you conjecture him to be

i conjecture him to be what among the ancient
egyptians was called a   using some unknown
word

a   and what is that

a   is what proclus in a little note to his third
book on the theology of plato defines as     
coming out with a sentence of greek




holding up his glass and steadily looking through its
transparency the cosmopolitan rejoined that in so
defining the thing proclus set it to modern understandings
in the most crystal light it was susceptible of i
will not rashly deny still if you could put the defition
in words suited to perceptions like mine i should
take it for a favor

a favor slightly lifting his cool eyebrows a
bridal favor i understand a knot of white ribands a
very beautiful type of the purity of true marriage but of
other favors i am yet to learn and still in a vague way
the word as you employ it strikes me as unpleasingly
significant in general of some poor unheroic submission
to being done good to

here the goblet of iced-water was brought and in
compliance with a sign from the cosmopolitan was
placed before the stranger who not before expressing
acknowledgments took a draught apparently refreshing   
its very coldness as with some is the case proving
not entirely uncongenial

at last setting down the goblet and gently wiping
from his lips the beads of water freshly clinging there
as to the valve of a coral-shell upon a reef he turned
upon the cosmopolitan and in a manner the most cool
self-possessed and matter-of-fact possible said i hold
to the metempsychosis and whoever i may be now i
feel that i was once the stoic arrian and have inklings
of having been equally puzzled by a word in the current
language of that former time very probably answering
to your word favor 




would you favor me by explaining said the cosmopolitan
blandly

sir responded the stranger with a very slight
degree of severity i like lucidity of all things and
am afraid i shall hardly be able to converse satisfactorily
with you unless you bear it in mind

the cosmopolitan ruminatingly eyed him awhile then
said the best way as i have heard to get out of a
labyrinth is to retrace one's steps i will accordingly
retrace mine and beg you will accompany me in
short once again to return to the point for what
reason did you warn me against my friend

briefly then and clearly because as before said i
conjecture him to be what among the ancient egyptians   

pray now earnestly deprecated the cosmopolitan
pray now why disturb the repose of those ancient
egyptians what to us are their words or their
thoughts are we pauper arabs without a house of
our own that with the mummies we must turn squatters
among the dust of the catacombs

pharaoh's poorest brick-maker lies proudlier in his
rags than the emperor of all the russias in his hollands
oracularly said the stranger for death though
in a worm is majestic while life though in a king is
contemptible so talk not against mummies it is a
part of my mission to teach mankind a due reverence
for mummies

fortunately to arrest these incoherencies or rather
to vary them a haggard inspired-looking man now




approached   a crazy beggar asking alms under the form
of peddling a rhapsodical tract composed by himself
and setting forth his claims to some rhapsodical apostleship
though ragged and dirty there was about him
no touch of vulgarity for by nature his manner was
not unrefined his frame slender and appeared the more
so from the broad untanned frontlet of his brow tangled
over with a disheveled mass of raven curls throwing a
still deeper tinge upon a complexion like that of a
shriveled berry nothing could exceed his look of picturesque
italian ruin and dethronement heightened by
what seemed just one glimmering peep of reason insufficient
to do him any lasting good but enough perhaps
to suggest a torment of latent doubts at times whether
his addled dream of glory were true

accepting the tract offered him the cosmopolitan
glanced over it and seeming to see just what it was closed
it put it in his pocket eyed the man a moment then
leaning over and presenting him with a shilling said to
him in tones kind and considerate i am sorry my
friend that i happen to be engaged just now but
having purchased your work i promise myself much
satisfaction in its perusal at my earliest leisure

in his tattered single-breasted frock-coat buttoned
meagerly up to his chin the shatter-brain made him a
bow which for courtesy would not have misbecome a
viscount then turned with silent appeal to the stranger
but the stranger sat more like a cold prism than ever
while an expression of keen yankee cuteness now replacing
his former mystical one lent added icicles to his




aspect his whole air said nothing from me the
repulsed petitioner threw a look full of resentful pride
and cracked disdain upon him and went his way

come now said the cosmopolitan a little reproachfully
you ought to have sympathized with that man
tell me did you feel no fellow-feeling look at his
tract here quite in the transcendental vein

excuse me said the stranger declining the tract
i never patronize scoundrels

scoundrels

i detected in him sir a damning peep of sense   
damning i say for sense in a seeming madman is scoundrelism
i take him for a cunning vagabond who picks
up a vagabond living by adroitly playing the madman
did you not remark how he flinched under my eye

really drawing a long astonished breath i could
hardly have divined in you a temper so subtlely distrustful
flinched to be sure he did poor fellow
you received him with so lame a welcome as for his
adroitly playing the madman invidious critics might
object the same to some one or two strolling magi of
these days but that is a matter i know nothing about
but once more and for the last time to return to the
point why sir did you warn me against my friend i
shall rejoice if as i think it will prove your want of
confidence in my friend rests upon a basis equally slender
with your distrust of the lunatic come why did you
warn me put it i beseech in few words and those
english

i warned you against him because he is suspected




for what on these boats is known   so they tell me   as
a mississippi operator

an operator ah he operates does he my friend
then is something like what the indians call a great
medicine is he he operates he purges he drains off
the repletions

i perceive sir said the stranger constitutionally
obtuse to the pleasant drollery that your notion of
what is called a great medicine needs correction the
great medicine among the indians is less a bolus than a
man in grave esteem for his politic sagacity

and is not my friend politic is not my friend sagacious
by your own definition is not my friend a great
medicine

no he is an operator a mississippi operator an
equivocal character that he is such i little doubt
having had him pointed out to me as such by one desirous
of initiating me into any little novelty of this
western region where i never before traveled and
sir if i am not mistaken you also are a stranger here
but indeed where in this strange universe is not one a
stranger and that is a reason why i felt moved to warn
you against a companion who could not be otherwise
than perilous to one of a free and trustful disposition
but i repeat the hope that thus far at least he has not
succeeded with you and trust that for the future he
will not

thank you for your concern but hardly can i equally
thank you for so steadily maintaining the hypothesis
of my friend's objectionableness true i but made his




acquaintance for the first to-day and know little of his
antecedents but that would seem no just reason why a
nature like his should not of itself inspire confidence
and since your own knowledge of the gentleman is not
by your account so exact as it might be you will pardon
me if i decline to welcome any further suggestions unflattering
to him indeed sir with friendly decision
let us change the subject







the mystical master introduces the practical disciple


 both the subject and the interlocutor replied
the stranger rising and waiting the return towards him
of a promenader that moment turning at the further
end of his walk

egbert said he calling

egbert a well-dressed commercial-looking gentleman
of about thirty responded in a way strikingly deferential
and in a moment stood near in the attitude less of
an equal companion apparently than a confidential follower

this said the stranger taking egbert by the hand
and leading him to the cosmopolitan this is egbert a
disciple i wish you to know egbert egbert was the
first among mankind to reduce to practice the principles
of mark winsome   principles previously accounted as
less adapted to life than the closet egbert turning
to the disciple who with seeming modesty a little
shrank under these compliments egbert this with
a salute towards the cosmopolitan is like all of us a
stranger i wish you egbert to know this brother
stranger be communicative with him particularly if




by anything hitherto dropped his curiosity has been
roused as to the precise nature of my philosophy i trust
you will not leave such curiosity ungratified you
egbert by simply setting forth your practice can do
more to enlighten one as to my theory than i myself
can by mere speech indeed it is by you that i myself
best understand myself for to every philosophy are
certain rear parts very important parts and these like
the rear of one's head are best seen by reflection
now as in a glass you egbert in your life reflect
to me the more important part of my system he who
approves you approves the philosophy of mark winsome

though portions of this harangue may perhaps in the
phraseology seem self-complaisant yet no trace of self-complacency
was perceptible in the speaker's manner
which throughout was plain unassuming dignified and
manly the teacher and prophet seemed to lurk more
in the idea so to speak than in the mere bearing of him
who was the vehicle of it

sir said the cosmopolitan who seemed not a little
interested in this new aspect of matters you speak of
a certain philosophy and a more or less occult one it
may be and hint of its bearing upon practical life pray
tell me if the study of this philosophy tends to the
same formation of character with the experiences of the
world

it does and that is the test of its truth for any
philosophy that being in operation contradictory to the
ways of the world tends to produce a character at odds




with it such a philosophy must necessarily be but a
cheat and a dream

you a little surprise me answered the cosmopolitan
for from an occasional profundity in you and also
from your allusions to a profound work on the theology
of plato it would seem but natural to surmise that if
you are the originator of any philosophy it must needs
so partake of the abstruse as to exalt it above the comparatively
vile uses of life

no uncommon mistake with regard to me rejoined
the other then meekly standing like a raphael if
still in golden accents old memnon murmurs his riddle
none the less does the balance-sheet of every man's
ledger unriddle the profit or loss of life sir with calm
energy man came into this world not to sit down and
muse not to befog himself with vain subtleties but to
gird up his loins and to work mystery is in the morning
and mystery in the night and the beauty of mystery
is everywhere but still the plain truth remains that
mouth and purse must be filled if hitherto you have
supposed me a visionary be undeceived i am no oneideaed
one either no more than the seers before me
was not seneca a usurer bacon a courtier and swedenborg
though with one eye on the invisible did he
not keep the other on the main chance along with
whatever else it may be given me to be i am a man of
serviceable knowledge and a man of the world know
me for such and as for my disciple here turning towards
him if you look to find any soft utopianisms
and last year's sunsets in him i smile to think how he




will set you right the doctrines i have taught him
will i trust lead him neither to the mad-house nor the
poor-house as so many other doctrines have served credulous
sticklers furthermore glancing upon him
paternally egbert is both my disciple and my poet
for poetry is not a thing of ink and rhyme but of
thought and act and in the latter way is by any one to
be found anywhere when in useful action sought in
a word my disciple here is a thriving young merchant
a practical poet in the west india trade there presenting
egbert's hand to the cosmopolitan i join you
and leave you with which words and without bowing
the master withdrew







the disciple unbends and consents to act a social part


in the master's presence the disciple had stood as one
not ignorant of his place modesty was in his expression
with a sort of reverential depression but the
presence of the superior withdrawn he seemed lithely
to shoot up erect from beneath it like one of those wire
men from a toy snuff-box

he was as before said a young man of about thirty
his countenance of that neuter sort which in repose
is neither prepossessing nor disagreeable so that it
seemed quite uncertain how he would turn out his
dress was neat with just enough of the mode to save it
from the reproach of originality in which general
respect though with a readjustment of details his costume
seemed modeled upon his master's but upon the
whole he was to all appearances the last person in the
world that one would take for the disciple of any transcendental
philosophy though indeed something
about his sharp nose and shaved chin seemed to hint
that if mysticism as a lesson ever came in his way he
might with the characteristic knack of a true




newenglander turn even so profitless a thing to some profitable
account

well said he now familiarly seating himself in the
vacated chair what do you think of mark sublime
fellow ain't he

that each member of the human guild is worthy
respect my friend rejoined the cosmopolitan is a
fact which no admirer of that guild will question but
that in view of higher natures the word sublime so frequently
applied to them can without confusion be also
applied to man is a point which man will decide for
himself though indeed if he decide it in the affirmative
it is not for me to object but i am curious to
know more of that philosophy of which at present i
have but inklings you its first disciple among men
it seems are peculiarly qualified to expound it have
you any objections to begin now

none at all squaring himself to the table where
shall i begin at first principles

you remember that it was in a practical way that
you were represented as being fitted for the clear exposition
now what you call first principles i have in
some things found to be more or less vague permit
me then in a plain way to suppose some common case
in real life and that done i would like you to tell me
how you the practical disciple of the philosophy i wish
to know about would in that case conduct

a business-like view propose the case

not only the case but the persons the case is
this there are two friends friends from childhood




bosom-friends one of whom for the first time being in
need for the first time seeks a loan from the other who
so far as fortune goes is more than competent to grant
it and the persons are to be you and i you the friend
from whom the loan is sought   i the friend who seeks
it you the disciple of the philosophy in question   i
a common man with no more philosophy than to know
that when i am comfortably warm i don't feel cold
and when i have the ague i shake mind now you
must work up your imagination and as much as possible
talk and behave just as if the case supposed were
a fact for brevity you shall call me frank and i will
call you charlie are you agreed

perfectly you begin

the cosmopolitan paused a moment then assuming a
serious and care-worn air suitable to the part to be
enacted addressed his hypothesized freind






the hypothetical friends


 charlie i am going to put confidence in you

you always have and with reason what is it
frank

charlie i am in want   urgent want of money

that's not well

but it will be well charlie if you loan me a hundred
dollars i would not ask this of you only my
need is sore and you and i have so long shared hearts
and minds together however unequally on my side that
nothing remains to prove our friendship than with the
same inequality on my side to share pursues you will
do me the favor won't you

favor what do you mean by asking me to do
you a favor

why charlie you never used to talk so

because frank you on your side never used to
talk so

but won't you loan me the money

no frank

why

because my rule forbids i give away money but




never loan it and of course the man who calls himself
my friend is above receiving alms the negotiation
of a loan is a business transaction and i will
transact no business with a friend what a friend is he
is socially and intellectually and i rate social and intellectual
friendship too high to degrade it on either
side into a pecuniary make-shift to be sure there are
and i have what is called business friends that is commercial
acquaintances very convenient persons but
i draw a red-ink line between them and my friends
in the true sense   my friends social and intellectual
in brief a true friend has nothing to do with loans
he should have a soul above loans loans are such
unfriendly accommodations as are to be had from the
soulless corporation of a bank by giving the regular
security and paying the regular discount

an unfriendly accommodation do those words go
together handsomely

like the poor farmer's team of an old man and
a cow   not handsomely but to the purpose look
frank a loan of money on interest is a sale of money
on credit to sell a thing on credit may be an
accommodation but where is the friendliness few
men in their senses except operators borrow money on
interest except upon a necessity akin to starvation
well now where is the friendliness of my letting a
starving man have say the money's worth of a barrel of
flour upon the condition that on a given day he shall let
me have the money's worth of a barrel and a half of flour
especially if i add this further proviso that if he fail so




to do i shall then to secure to myself the money's
worth of my barrel and his half barrel put his heart up
at public auction and as it is cruel to part families
throw in his wife's and children's

i understand with a pathetic shudder but even
did it come to that such a step on the creditor's part
let us for the honor of human nature hope were less
the intention than the contingency

but frank a contingency not unprovided for in
the taking beforehand of due securities

still charlie was not the loan in the first place a
friend's act

and the auction in the last place an enemy's act
don't you see the enmity lies couched in the friendship
just as the ruin in the relief

i must be very stupid to-day charlie but really
i can't understand this excuse me my dear friend but
it strikes me that in going into the philosophy of the
subject you go somewhat out of your depth

so said the incautious wader-out to the ocean but
the ocean replied it is just the other way my wet
friend and drowned him

that charlie is a fable about as unjust to the
ocean as some of sop's are to the animals the ocean
is a magnanimous element and would scorn to assassinate
a poor fellow let alone taunting him in the act
but i don't understand what you say about enmity
couched in friendship and ruin in relief

i will illustrate frank the needy man is a train
slipped off the rail he who loans him money on




interest is the one who by way of accommodation helps
get the train back where it belongs but then by way
of making all square and a little more telegraphs to an
agent thirty miles a-head by a precipice to throw just
there on his account a beam across the track your
needy man's principle-and-interest friend is i say
again a friend with an enmity in reserve no no my
dear friend no interest for me i scorn interest

well charlie none need you charge loan me
without interest

that would be alms again

alms if the sum borrowed is returned

yes an alms not of the principle but the interest

well i am in sore need so i will not decline the
alms seeing that it is you charlie gratefully will i
accept the alms of the interest no humiliation between
friends

now how in the refined view of friendship can you
suffer yourself to talk so my dear frank it pains me
for though i am not of the sour mind of solomon that
in the hour of need a stranger is better than a brother
yet i entirely agree with my sublime master who in his
essay on friendship says so nobly that if he want a
terrestrial convenience not to his friend celestial or
friend social and intellectual would he go no for his
terrestial convenience to his friend terrestrial or humbler
business-friend he goes very lucidly he adds the
reason because for the superior nature which on no
account can ever descend to do good to be annoyed




with requests to do it when the inferior one which by
no instruction can ever rise above that capacity stands
always inclined to it   this is unsuitable

then i will not consider you as my friend celestial
but as the other

it racks me to come to that but to oblige you i'll
do it we are business friends business is business
you want to negotiate a loan very good on what
paper will you pay three per cent a month where
is your security

surely you will not exact those formalities from
your old schoolmate   him with whom you have so often
sauntered down the groves of academe discoursing of
the beauty of virtue and the grace that is in kindliness   
and all for so paltry a sum security our being fellowacademics
and friends from childhood up is security

pardon me my dear frank our being fellow-academics
is the worst of securities while our having been
friends from childhood up is just no security at all
you forget we are now business friends

and you on your side forget charlie that as your
business friend i can give you no security my need being
so sore that i cannot get an indorser

no indorser then no business loan

since then charlie neither as the one nor the other
sort of friend you have defined can i prevail with you
how if combining the two i sue as both

are you a centaur

when all is said then what good have i of your
friendship regarded in what light you will




the good which is in the philosophy of mark winsome
as reduced to practice by a practical disciple

and why don't you add much good may the philosophy
of mark winsome do me ah turning invokingly
what is friendship if it be not the helping hand
and the feeling heart the good samaritan pouring out
at need the purse as the vial

now my dear frank don't be childish through
tears never did man see his way in the dark i should
hold you unworthy that sincere friendship i bear you
could i think that friendship in the ideal is too lofty for
you to conceive and let me tell you my dear frank
that you would seriously shake the foundations of our
love if ever again you should repeat the present scene
the philosophy which is mine in the strongest way
teaches plain-dealing let me then now as at the most
suitable time candidly disclose certain circumstances
you seem in ignorance of though our friendship began
in boyhood think not that on my side at least it began
injudiciously boys are little men it is said you i
juvenilely picked out for my friend for your favorable
points at the time not the least of which were your good
manners handsome dress and your parents rank and
repute of wealth in short like any grown man boy
though i was i went into the market and chose me my
mutton not for its leanness but its fatness in other
words there seemed in you the schoolboy who always
had silver in his pocket a reasonable probability that
you would never stand in lean need of fat succor and if
my early impression has not been verified by the event




it is only because of the caprice of fortune producing a
fallibility of human expectations however discreet

oh that i should listen to this cold-blooded disclosure

a little cold blood in your ardent veins my dear
frank wouldn't do you any harm let me tell you
cold-blooded you say that because my disclosure
seems to involve a vile prudence on my side but not
so my reason for choosing you in part for the points i
have mentioned was solely with a view of preserving
inviolate the delicacy of the connection for   do but
think of it   what more distressing to delicate friendship
formed early than your friend's eventually in manhood
dropping in of a rainy night for his little loan of five
dollars or so can delicate friendship stand that
and on the other side would delicate friendship so
long as it retained its delicacy do that would you
not instinctively say of your dripping friend in the entry
i have been deceived fraudulently deceived in this
man he is no true friend that in platonic love to demand
love-tries

and rites doubly rights they are cruel charlie

take it how you will heed well how by too importunately
claiming those rights as you call them you
shake those foundations i hinted of for though as it
turns out i in my early friendship built me a fair house
on a poor site yet such pains and cost have i lavished
on that house that after all it is dear to me no i
would not lose the sweet boon of your friendship frank
but beware




and of what of being in need oh charlie
you talk not to a god a being who in himself holds his
own estate but to a man who being a man is the sport
of fate's wind and wave and who mounts towards heaven
or sinks towards hell as the billows roll him in trough
or on crest

tut frank man is no such poor devil as that
comes to   no poor drifting sea-weed of the universe
man has a soul which if he will puts him beyond fortune's
finger and the future's spite don't whine like
fortune's whipped dog frank or by the heart of a true
friend i will cut ye

cut me you have already cruel charlie and to the
quick call to mind the days we went nutting the
times we walked in the woods arms wreathed about
each other showing trunks invined like the trees   oh
charlie

pish we were boys

then lucky the fate of the first-born of egypt cold
in the grave ere maturity struck them with a sharper
frost   charlie

fie you're a girl

help help charlie i want help

help to say nothing of the friend there is something
wrong about the man who wants help there is
somewhere a defect a want in brief a need a crying
need somewhere about that man

so there is charlie   help help

how foolish a cry when to implore help is itself
the proof of undesert of it




oh this all along is not you charlie but some
ventriloquist who usurps your larynx it is mark winsome
that speaks not charlie

if so thank heaven the voice of mark winsome is
not alien but congenial to my larynx if the philosophy
of that illustrious teacher find little response among
mankind at large it is less that they do not possess
teachable tempers than because they are so unfortunate
as not to have natures predisposed to accord with him

welcome that compliment to humanity exclaimed
frank with energy the truer because unintended
and long in this respect may humanity remain what
you affirm it and long it will since humanity inwardly
feeling how subject it is to straits and hence
how precious is help will for selfishness sake if no
other long postpone ratifying a philosophy that banishes
help from the world but charlie charlie speak as
you used to tell me you will help me were the case
reversed not less freely would i loan you the money
than you would ask me to loan it

 i ask i ask a loan frank by this hand under
no circumstances would i accept a loan though without
asking pressed on me the experience of china
aster might warn me

and what was that

not very unlike the experience of the man that
built himself a palace of moon-beams and when the moon
set was surprised that his palace vanished with it i
will tell you about china aster i wish i could do so
in my own words but unhappily the original




storyteller here has so tyrannized over me that it is quite
impossible for me to repeat his incidents without sliding
into his style i forewarn you of this that you may
not think me so maudlin as in some parts the story
would seem to make its narrator it is too bad that
any intellect expecially in so small a matter should
have such power to impose itself upon another against
its best exerted will too however it is satisfaction to
know that the main moral to which all tends i fully
approve but to begin







in which the story of china aster is at second-hand told by
one who while not disapproving the moral disclaims the
spirit of the style


 china aster was a young candle-maker of marietta
at the mouth of the muskingum   one whose trade would
seem a kind of subordinate branch of that parent craft
and mystery of the hosts of heaven to be the means
effectively or otherwise of shedding some light through
the darkness of a planet benighted but he made little
money by the business much ado had poor china
aster and his family to live he could if he chose light
up from his stores a whole street but not so easily
could he light up with prosperity the hearts of his
household

now china aster it so happened had a friend
orchis a shoemaker one whose calling it is to defend
the understandings of men from naked contact with the
substance of things a very useful vocation and which
spite of all the wiseacres may prophesy will hardly go
out of fashion so long as rocks are hard and flints will
gall all at once by a capital prize in a lottery this
useful shoemaker was raised from a bench to a sofa a
small nabob was the shoemaker now and the understandings
of men let them shift for themselves not




that orchis was by prosperity elated into heartlessness
not at all because in his fine apparel strolling one
morning into the candlery and gayly switching about
at the candle-boxes with his gold-headed cane   while
poor china aster with his greasy paper cap and leather
apron was selling one candle for one penny to a poor
orange-woman who with the patronizing coolness of a
liberal customer required it to be carefully rolled up
and tied in a half sheet of paper   lively orchis the
woman being gone discontinued his gay switchings and
said this is poor business for you friend china
aster your capital is too small you must drop this
vile tallow and hold up pure spermaceti to the world
i tell you what it is you shall have one thousand dollars
to extend with in fact you must make money
china aster i don't like to see your little boy paddling
about without shoes as he does

heaven bless your goodness friend orchis replied
the candle-maker but don't take it illy if i call to
mind the word of my uncle the blacksmith who when
a loan was offered him declined it saying to ply my
own hammer light though it be i think best rather
than piece it out heavier by welding to it a bit off a
neighbor's hammer though that may have some weight
to spare otherwise were the borrowed bit suddenly
wanted again it might not split off at the welding but
too much to one side or the other

nonsense friend china aster don't be so honest
your boy is barefoot besides a rich man lose by a
poor man or a friend be the worse by a friend




china aster i am afraid that in leaning over into your
vats here this morning you have spilled out your wisdom
hush i won't hear any more where's your
desk oh here with that orchis dashed off a check
on his bank and off-handedly presenting it said
there friend china aster is your one thousand dollars
when you make it ten thousand as you soon
enough will for experience the only true knowledge
teaches me that for every one good luck is in store
then china aster why then you can return me the
money or not just as you please but in any event
give yourself no concern for i shall never demand payment


now as kind heaven will so have it that to a
hungry man bread is a great temptation and therefore
he is not too harshly to be blamed if when freely
offered he take it even though it be uncertain whether
he shall ever be able to reciprocate so to a poor man
proffered money is equally enticing and the worst that
can be said of him if he accept it is just what can be
said in the other case of the hungry man in short the
poor candle-maker's scrupulous morality succumbed to
his unscrupulous necessity as is now and then apt to be
the case he took the check and was about carefully
putting it away for the present when orchis switching
about again with his gold-headed cane said by-the-way
china aster it don't mean anything but suppose
you make a little memorandum of this won't do any
harm you know so china aster gave orchis his note
for one thousand dollars on demand orchis took it and




looked at it a moment pooh i told you friend china
aster i wasn't going ever to make any demand then
tearing up the note and switching away again at the
candle-boxes said carelessly put it at four years
so china aster gave orchis his note for one thousand
dollars at four years you see i'll never trouble you
about this said orchis slipping it in his pocket-book
give yourself no further thought friend china aster
than how best to invest your money and don't forget
my hint about spermaceti go into that and i'll buy
all my light of you with which encouraging words he
with wonted rattling kindness took leave

china aster remained standing just where orchis
had left him when suddenly two elderly friends
having nothing better to do dropped in for a chat
the chat over china aster in greasy cap and apron
ran after orchis and said friend orchis heaven
will reward you for your good intentions but here is
your check and now give me my note

your honesty is a bore china aster said orchis not
without displeasure i won't take the check from you

then you must take it from the pavement orchis
said china aster and picking up a stone he placed
the check under it on the walk

china aster said orchis inquisitively eying him
after my leaving the candlery just now what asses
dropped in there to advise with you that now you hurry
after me and act so like a fool shouldn't wonder
if it was those two old asses that the boys nickname
old plain talk and old prudence




yes it was those two orchis but don't call them
names

a brace of spavined old croakers old plain talk
had a shrew for a wife and that's made him shrewish
and old prudence when a boy broke down in an applestall
and that discouraged him for life no better sport
for a knowing spark like me than to hear old plain talk
wheeze out his sour old saws while old prudence stands
by leaning on his staff wagging his frosty old pow and
chiming in at every clause

how can you speak so friend orchis of those who
were my father's friends

save me from my friends if those old croakers were
old honesty's friends i call your father so for every
one used to why did they let him go in his old age on
the town why china aster i've often heard from
my mother the chronicler that those two old fellows
with old conscience   as the boys called the crabbed old
quaker that's dead now   they three used to go to the
poor-house when your father was there and get round
his bed and talk to him for all the world as eliphaz
bildad and zophar did to poor old pauper job yes
job's comforters were old plain talk and old prudence
and old conscience to your poor old father
friends i should like to know who you call foes
with their everlasting croaking and reproaching they
tormented poor old honesty your father to death

at these words recalling the sad end of his worthy
parent china aster could not restrain some tears upon
which orchis said why china aster you are the




dolefulest creature why don't you china aster take
a bright view of life you will never get on in your
business or anything else if you don't take the bright view
of life it's the ruination of a man to take the dismal
one then gayly poking at him with his gold-headed
cane why don't you then why don't you be bright
and hopeful like me why don't you have confidence
china aster

i'm sure i don't know friend orchis soberly
replied china aster but may be my not having
drawn a lottery-prize like you may make some difference


nonsense before i knew anything about the prize
i was gay as a lark just as gay as i am now in fact
it has always been a principle with me to hold to the
bright view

upon this china aster looked a little hard at orchis
because the truth was that until the lucky prize came
to him orchis had gone under the nickname of doleful
dumps he having been beforetimes of a hypochondriac
turn so much so as to save up and put by a few dollars
of his scanty earnings against that rainy day he used to
groan so much about

i tell you what it is now friend china aster said
orchis pointing down to the check under the stone and
then slapping his pocket the check shall lie there if
you say so but your note shan't keep it company in
fact china aster i am too sincerely your friend to take
advantage of a passing fit of the blues in you you shall
reap the benefit of my friendship with which




buttoning up his coat in a jiffy away he ran leaving the
check behind

at first china aster was going to tear it up but
thinking that this ought not to be done except in the
presence of the drawer of the check he mused a while
and picking it up trudged back to the candlery fully
resolved to call upon orchis soon as his day's work was
over and destroy the check before his eyes but it so
happened that when china aster called orchis was out
and having waited for him a weary time in vain china
aster went home still with the check but still resolved
not to keep it another day bright and early next
morning he would a second time go after orchis and
would no doubt make a sure thing of it by finding him
in his bed for since the lottery-prize came to him orchis
besides becoming more cheery had also grown a
little lazy but as destiny would have it that same
night china aster had a dream in which a being in the
guise of a smiling angel and holding a kind of cornucopia
in her hand hovered over him pouring down
showers of small gold dollars thick as kernels of corn
i am bright future friend china aster said the angel
and if you do what friend orchis would have you
do just see what will come of it with which bright
future with another swing of her cornucopia poured
such another shower of small gold dollars upon him
that it seemed to bank him up all round and he waded
about in it like a maltster in malt

now dreams are wonderful things as everybody
knows   so wonderful indeed that some people stop not




short of ascribing them directly to heaven and china
aster who was of a proper turn of mind in everything
thought that in consideration of the dream it would be
but well to wait a little ere seeking orchis again during
the day china aster's mind dwelling continually
upon the dream he was so full of it that when old
plain talk dropped in to see him just before dinnertime
as he often did out of the interest he took in old
honesty's son china aster told all about his vision
adding that he could not think that so radiant an angel
could deceive and indeed talked at such a rate that
one would have thought he believed the angel some
beautiful human philanthropist something in this sort
old plain talk understood him and accordingly in his
plain way said china aster you tell me that an angel
appeared to you in a dream now what does that
amount to but this that you dreamed an angel appeared
to you go right away china aster and return the
check as i advised you before if friend prudence were
here he would say just the same thing with which
words old plain talk went off to find friend prudence
but not succeeding was returning to the candlery himself
when at distance mistaking him for a dun who had
long annoyed him china aster in a panic barred all his
doors and ran to the back part of the candlery where
no knock could be heard

by this sad mistake being left with no friend to argue
the other side of the question china aster was so
worked upon at last by musing over his dream that
nothing would do but he must get the check cashed and




lay out the money the very same day in buying a good
lot of spermaceti to make into candles by which operation
he counted upon turning a better penny than he
ever had before in his life in fact this he believed
would prove the foundation of that famous fortune
which the angel had promised him

now in using the money china aster was resolved
punctually to pay the interest every six months till the
principal should be returned howbeit not a word about
such a thing had been breathed by orchis though
indeed according to custom as well as law in such
matters interest would legitimately accrue on the loan
nothing to the contrary having been put in the bond
whether orchis at the time had this in mind or not
there is no sure telling but to all appearance he never
so much as cared to think about the matter one way or
other

though the spermaceti venture rather disappointed
china aster's sanguine expectations yet he made out to
pay the first six months interest and though his next
venture turned out still less prosperously yet by pinching
his family in the matter of fresh meat and what
pained him still more his boys schooling he contrived
to pay the second six months interest sincerely grieved
that integrity as well as its opposite though not in an
equal degree costs something sometimes

meanwhile orchis had gone on a trip to europe by
advice of a physician it so happening that since the
lottery-prize came to him it had been discovered to orchis
that his health was not very firm though he had




never complained of anything before but a slight ailing
of the spleen scarce worth talking about at the time
so orchis being abroad could not help china aster's
paying his interest as he did however much he might
have been opposed to it for china aster paid it to
orchis's agent who was of too business-like a turn to
decline interest regularly paid in on a loan

but overmuch to trouble the agent on that score was
not again to be the fate of china aster for not being
of that skeptical spirit which refuses to trust customers
his third venture resulted through bad debts in
almost a total loss   a bad blow for the candle-maker
neither did old plain talk and old prudence neglect
the opportunity to read him an uncheerful enough lesson
upon the consequences of his disregarding their advice
in the matter of having nothing to do with borrowed
money it's all just as i predicted said old plain
talk blowing his old nose with his old bandana yea
indeed is it chimed in old prudence rapping his staff
on the floor and then leaning upon it looking with
solemn forebodings upon china aster low-spirited
enough felt the poor candle-maker till all at once who
should come with a bright face to him but his bright
friend the angel in another dream again the cornucopia
poured out its treasure and promised still more
revived by the vision he resolved not to be downhearted
but up and at it once more   contrary to the
advice of old plain talk backed as usual by his crony
which was to the effect that under present circumstances
the best thing china aster could do would be to




wind up his business settle if he could all his liabilities
and then go to work as a journeyman by which
he could earn good wages and give up from that time
henceforth all thoughts of rising above being a paid subordinate
to men more able than himself for china aster's
career thus far plainly proved him the legitimate son of
old honesty who as every one knew had never shown
much business-talent so little in fact that many said
of him that he had no business to be in business and
just this plain saying plain talk now plainly applied
to china aster and old prudence never disagreed with
him but the angel in the dream did and maugre plain
talk put quite other notions into the candle-maker

he considered what he should do towards restablishing
himself doubtless had orchis been in the country
he would have aided him in this strait as it was he
applied to others and as in the world much as some may
hint to the contrary an honest man in misfortune still
can find friends to stay by him and help him even so
it proved with china aster who at last succeeded in borrowing
from a rich old farmer the sum of six hundred
dollars at the usual interest of money-lenders upon the
security of a secret bond signed by china aster's wife
and himself to the effect that all such right and title to
any property that should be left her by a well-to-do
childless uncle an invalid tanner such property should
in the event of china aster's failing to return the borrowed
sum on the given day be the lawful possession
of the money-lender true it was just as much as
china aster could possibly do to induce his wife a




careful woman to sign this bond because she had always
regarded her promised share in her uncle's estate as an
anchor well to windward of the hard times in which
china aster had always been more or less involved and
from which in her bosom she never had seen much
chance of his freeing himself some notion may be had
of china aster's standing in the heart and head of his
wife by a short sentence commonly used in reply to
such persons as happened to sound her on the point
china aster she would say is a good husband but
a bad business man indeed she was a connection on
the maternal side of old plain talk's but had not
china aster taken good care not to let old plain talk
and old prudence hear of his dealings with the old
farmer ten to one they would in some way have interfered
with his success in that quarter

it has been hinted that the honesty of china aster
was what mainly induced the money-lender to befriend
him in his misfortune and this must be apparent for
had china aster been a different man the money-lender
might have dreaded lest in the event of his failing to
meet his note he might some way prove slippery   more
especially as in the hour of distress worked upon by
remorse for so jeopardizing his wife's money his heart
might prove a traitor to his bond not to hint that it
was more than doubtful how such a secret security and
claim as in the last resort would be the old farmer's
would stand in a court of law but though one inference
from all this may be that had china aster been
something else than what he was he would not have




been trusted and therefore he would have been effectually
shut out from running his own and wife's head
into the usurer's noose yet those who when everything
at last came out maintained that in this view
and to this extent the honesty of the candle-maker was
no advantage to him in so saying such persons said
what every good heart must deplore and no prudent
tongue will admit

it may be mentioned that the old farmer made
china aster take part of his loan in three old dried-up
cows and one lame horse not improved by the glanders
these were thrown in at a pretty high figure the old
money-lender having a singular prejudice in regard to
the high value of any sort of stock raised on his farm
with a great deal of difficulty and at more loss china
aster disposed of his cattle at public auction no private
purchaser being found who could be prevailed
upon to invest and now raking and scraping in every
way and working early and late china aster at last
started afresh nor without again largely and confidently
extending himself however he did not try his
hand at the spermaceti again but admonished by experience
returned to tallow but having bought a
good lot of it by the time he got it into candles tallow
fell so low and candles with it that his candles per
pound barely sold for what he had paid for the tallow
meantime a year's unpaid interest had accrued on orchis
loan but china aster gave himself not so much
concern about that as about the interest now due to
the old farmer but he was glad that the principal




there had yet some time to run however the skinny
old fellow gave him some trouble by coming after him
every day or two on a scraggy old white horse furnished
with a musty old saddle and goaded into his
shambling old paces with a withered old raw hide all
the neighbors said that surely death himself on the
pale horse was after poor china aster now and
something so it proved for ere long china aster
found himself involved in troubles mortal enough

at this juncture orchis was heard of orchis it seemed
had returned from his travels and clandestinely married
and in a kind of queer way was living in pennsylvania
among his wife's relations who among other
things had induced him to join a church or rather
semi-religious school of come-outers and what was
still more orchis without coming to the spot himself
had sent word to his agent to dispose of some of his
property in marietta and remit him the proceeds
within a year after china aster received a letter from
orchis commending him for his punctuality in paying
the first year's interest and regretting the necessity
that he orchis was now under of using all his dividends
so he relied upon china aster's paying the
next six months interest and of course with the back
interest not more surprised than alarmed china
aster thought of taking steamboat to go and see orchis
but he was saved that expense by the unexpected
arrival in marietta of orchis in person suddenly called
there by that strange kind of capriciousness lately characterizing
him no sooner did china aster hear of




his old friend's arrival than he hurried to call upon him
he found him curiously rusty in dress sallow in cheek
and decidedly less gay and cordial in manner which
the more surprised china aster because in former
days he had more than once heard orchis in his light
rattling way declare that all he orchis wanted to
make him a perfectly happy hilarious and benignant
man was a voyage to europe and a wife with a free
development of his inmost nature

upon china aster's stating his case his rusted
friend was silent for a time then in an odd way said
that he would not crowd china aster but still his
orchis necessities were urgent could not china
aster mortgage the candlery he was honest and
must have moneyed friends and could he not press
his sales of candles could not the market be forced
a little in that particular the profits on candles
must be very great seeing now that orchis had
the notion that the candle-making business was a very
profitable one and knowing sorely enough what an
error was here china aster tried to undeceive him
but he could not drive the truth into orchis   orchis
being very obtuse here and at the same time
strange to say very melancholy finally orchis
glanced off from so unpleasing a subject into the most
unexpected reflections taken from a religious point
of view upon the unstableness and deceitfulness of
the human heart but having as he thought experienced
something of that sort of thing china aster
did not take exception to his friend's observations




but still refrained from so doing almost as much for
the sake of sympathetic sociality as anything else
presently orchis without much ceremony rose and
saying he must write a letter to his wife bade his
friend good-bye but without warmly shaking him by
the hand as of old

in much concern at the change china aster made
earnest inquiries in suitable quarters as to what things
as yet unheard of had befallen orchis to bring about
such a revolution and learned at last that besides traveling
and getting married and joining the sect of
come-outers orchis had somehow got a bad dyspepsia
and lost considerable property through a breach of
trust on the part of a factor in new york telling
these things to old plain talk that man of some
knowledge of the world shook his old head and told
china aster that though he hoped it might prove otherwise
yet it seemed to him that all he had communicated
about orchis worked together for bad omens as to
his future forbearance   especially he added with a
grim sort of smile in view of his joining the sect of
come-outers for if some men knew what was their
inmost natures instead of coming out with it they
would try their best to keep it in which indeed was
the way with the prudent sort in all which sour notions
old prudence as usual chimed in

when interest-day came again china aster by the
utmost exertions could only pay orchis agent a small
part of what was due and a part of that was made up
by his children's gift money bright tenpenny pieces




and new quarters kept in their little money-boxes and
pawning his best clothes with those of his wife and
children so that all were subjected to the hardship of
staying away from church and the old usurer too
now beginning to be obstreperous china aster paid
him his interest and some other pressing debts with
money got by at last mortgaging the candlery

when next interest-day came round for orchis not
a penny could be raised with much grief of heart
china aster so informed orchis agent meantime the
note to the old usurer fell due and nothing from china
aster was ready to meet it yet as heaven sends its
rain on the just and unjust alike by a coincidence not
unfavorable to the old farmer the well-to-do uncle the
tanner having died the usurer entered upon possession
of such part of his property left by will to the wife
of china aster when still the next interest-day for
orchis came round it found china aster worse off than
ever for besides his other troubles he was now weak
with sickness feebly dragging himself to orchis
agent he met him in the street told him just how it
was upon which the agent with a grave enough face
said that he had instructions from his employer not to
crowd him about the interest at present but to say to
him that about the time the note would mature orchis
would have heavy liabilities to meet and therefore the
note must at that time be certainly paid and of course
the back interest with it and not only so but as orchis
had had to allow the interest for good part of the
time he hoped that for the back interest china aster




would in reciprocation have no objections to allowing
interest on the interest annually to be sure this was
not the law but between friends who accommodate
each other it was the custom

just then old plain talk with old prudence turned
the corner coming plump upon china aster as the
agent left him and whether it was a sun-stroke or
whether they accidentally ran against him or whether
it was his being so weak or whether it was everything
together or how it was exactly there is no telling but
poor china aster fell to the earth and striking his head
sharply was picked up senseless it was a day in july
such a light and heat as only the midsummer banks of
the inland ohio know china aster was taken home
on a door lingered a few days with a wandering mind
and kept wandering on till at last at dead of night
when nobody was aware his spirit wandered away into
the other world

old plain talk and old prudence neither of whom
ever omitted attending any funeral which indeed was
their chief exercise   these two were among the sincerest
mourners who followed the remains of the son of
their ancient friend to the grave

it is needless to tell of the executions that followed
how that the candlery was sold by the mortgagee how
orchis never got a penny for his loan and how in the
case of the poor widow chastisement was tempered with
mercy for though she was left penniless she was not left
childless yet unmindful of the alleviation a spirit of
complaint at what she impatiently called the bitterness




of her lot and the hardness of the world so preyed upon
her as ere long to hurry her from the obscurity of
indigence to the deeper shades of the tomb

but though the straits in which china aster had left
his family had besides apparently dimming the world's
regard likewise seemed to dim its sense of the probity
of its deceased head and though this as some thought
did not speak well for the world yet it happened in this
case as in others that though the world may for a time
seem insensible to that merit which lies under a cloud
yet sooner or later it always renders honor where honor
is due for upon the death of the widow the freemen
of marietta as a tribute of respect for china aster and
an expression of their conviction of his high moral
worth passed a resolution that until they attained maturity
his children should be considered the town's
guests no mere verbal compliment like those of some
public bodies for on the same day the orphans were
officially installed in that hospitable edifice where their
worthy grandfather the town's guest before them had
breathed his last breath

but sometimes honor may be paid to the memory of
an honest man and still his mound remain without a
monument not so however with the candle-maker
at an early day plain talk had procured a plain stone
and was digesting in his mind what pithy word or two
to place upon it when there was discovered in china
aster's otherwise empty wallet an epitaph written
probably in one of those disconsolate hours attended
with more or less mental aberration perhaps so frequent




with him for some months prior to his end a memorandum
on the back expressed the wish that it might be
placed over his grave though with the sentiment of
the epitaph plain talk did not disagree he himself being
at times of a hypochondriac turn   at least so many
said   yet the language struck him as too much drawn
out so after consultation with old prudence he decided
upon making use of the epitaph yet not without verbal
retrenchments and though when these were made
the thing still appeared wordy to him nevertheless
thinking that since a dead man was to be spoken about
it was but just to let him speak for himself especially
when he spoke sincerely and when by so doing the
more salutary lesson would be given he had the retrenched
inscription chiseled as follows upon the stone

here lie
the remains of
china aster the candle-maker
whose career
was an example of the truth of scripture as found
in the
sober philosophy
of
solomon the wise
for he was ruined by allowing himself to be persuaded
against his better sense
into the free indulgence of confidence
and
an ardently bright view of life
to the exclusion
of
that counsel which comes by heeding
the
opposite view

this inscription raised some talk in the town and
was rather severely criticised by the capitalist   one of a




very cheerful turn   who had secured his loan to china
aster by the mortgage and though it also proved
obnoxious to the man who in town-meeting had first
moved for the compliment to china aster's memory
and indeed was deemed by him a sort of slur upon the
candle-maker to ihat degree that he refused to believe
that the candle-maker himself had composed it charging
old plain talk with the authorship alleging that
the internal evidence showed that none but that veteran
old croaker could have penned such a jeremiade   yet
for all this the stone stood in everything of course
old plain talk was seconded by old prudence who
one day going to the grave-yard in great-coat and overshoes   
for though it was a sunshiny morning he
thought that owing to heavy dews dampness might
lurk in the ground   long stood before the stone sharply
leaning over on his staff spectacles on nose spelling out
the epitaph word by word and afterwards meeting old
plain talk in the street gave a great rap with his stick
and said friend plain talk that epitaph will do
very well nevertheless one short sentence is wanting
 upon which plain talk said it was too late the
chiseled words being so arranged after the usual manner
of such inscriptions that nothing could be interlined
then said old prudence i will put it in
the shape of a postscript accordingly with the
approbation of old plain talk he had the following
words chiseled at the left-hand corner of the stone and
pretty low down

the root of all was a friendly loan






ending with a rupture of the hypothesis


 with what heart cried frank still in character
have you told me this story a story i can no way
approve for its moral if accepted would drain me of
all reliance upon my last stay and therefore of my last
courage in life for what was that bright view of
china aster but a cheerful trust that if he but kept up
a brave heart worked hard and ever hoped for the best
all at last would go well if your purpose charlie in
telling me this story was to pain me and keenly you
have succeeded but if it was to destroy my last confidence
i praise god you have not

confidence cried charlie who on his side
seemed with his whole heart to enter into the spirit of
the thing what has confidence to do with the matter
that moral of the story which i am for commending to
you is this the folly on both sides of a friend's helping
a friend for was not that loan of orchis to china
aster the first step towards their estrangement and
did it not bring about what in effect was the enmity of
orchis i tell you frank true friendship like other
precious things is not rashly to be meddled with and




what more meddlesome between friends than a loan
a regular marplot for how can you help that the
helper must turn out a creditor and creditor and
friend can they ever be one no not in the most
lenient case since out of lenity to forego one's claim
is less to be a friendly creditor than to cease to be a
creditor at all but it will not do to rely upon this
lenity no not in the best man for the best man as the
worst is subject to all mortal contingencies he may
travel he may marry he may join the come-outers
or some equally untoward school or sect not to speak of
other things that more or less tend to new-cast the
character and were there nothing else who shall
answer for his digestion upon which so much depends

but charlie dear charlie   

nay wait   you have hearkened to my story in
vain if you do not see that however indulgent and
right-minded i may seem to you now that is no
guarantee for the future and into the power of
that uncertain personality which through the mutability
of my humanity i may hereafter become
should not common sense dissuade you my dear frank
from putting yourself consider would you in
your present need be willing to accept a loan from a
friend securing him by a mortgage on your homestead
and do so knowing that you had no reason to feel satisfied
that the mortgage might not eventually be transferred
into the hands of a foe yet the difference
between this man and that man is not so great as the
difference between what the same man be to-day and




what he may be in days to come for there is no bent
of heart or turn of thought which any man holds by
virtue of an unalterable nature or will even those
feelings and opinions deemed most identical with eternal
right and truth it is not impossible but that as personal
persuasions they may in reality be but the result
of some chance tip of fate's elbow in throwing her dice
for not to go into the first seeds of things and passing
by the accident of parentage predisposing to this or that
habit of mind descend below these and tell me if you
change this man's experiences or that man's books will
wisdom go surety for his unchanged convictions as
particular food begets particular dreams so particular
experiences or books particular feelings or beliefs i
will hear nothing of that fine babble about development
and its laws there is no development in opinion and
feeling but the developments of time and tide you
may deem all this talk idle frank but conscience bids
me show you how fundamental the reasons for treating
you as i do

but charlie dear charlie what new notions are
these i thought that man was no poor drifting weed
of the universe as you phrased it that if so minded
he could have a will a way a thought and a heart of
his own but now you have turned everything upside
down again with an inconsistency that amazes and
shocks me

inconsistency bah

there speaks the ventriloquist again sighed
frank in bitterness




illy pleased it may be by this repetition of an allusion
little flattering to his originality however much so
to his docility the disciple sought to carry it off by exclaiming
yes i turn over day and night with
indefatigable pains the sublime pages of my master
and unfortunately for you my dear friend i find nothing
there that leads me to think otherwise than i do but
enough in this matter the experience of china aster
teaches a moral more to the point than anything mark
winsome can offer or i either

i cannot think so charlie for neither am i china
aster nor do i stand in his position the loan to china
aster was to extend his business with the loan i seek
is to relieve my necessities

your dress my dear frank is respectable your
cheek is not gaunt why talk of necessities when
nakedness and starvation beget the only real necessities

but i need relief charlie and so sorely that i now
conjure you to forget that i was ever your friend while
i apply to you only as a fellow-being whom surely
you will not turn away

that i will not take off your hat bow over to
the ground and supplicate an alms of me in the way of
london streets and you shall not be a sturdy beggar in
vain but no man drops pennies into the hat of a
friend let me tell you if you turn beggar then for
the honor of noble friendship i turn stranger

enough cried the other rising and with a toss of
his shoulders seeming disdainfully to throw off the




character he had assumed enough i have had my fill
of the philosophy of mark winsome as put into action
and moonshiny as it in theory may be yet a very practical
philosophy it turns out in effect as he himself
engaged i should find but miserable for my race
should i be if i thought he spoke truth when he
claimed for proof of the soundness of his system that
the study of it tended to much the same formation of
character with the experiences of the world   apt disciple
why wrinkle the brow and waste the oil both
of life and the lamp only to turn out a head kept cool
by the under ice of the heart what your illustrious
magian has taught you any poor old broken-down
heart-shrunken dandy might have lisped pray leave
me and with you take the last dregs of your inhuman
philosophy and here take this shilling and at the
first wood-landing buy yourself a few chips to warm the
frozen natures of you and your philosopher by

with these words and a grand scorn the cosmopolitan
turned on his heel leaving his companion at a loss to
determine where exactly the fictitious character had
been dropped and the real one if any resumed if
any because with pointed meaning there occurred to
him as he gazed after the cosmopolitan these familiar
lines


 all the world's a stage
and all the men and women merely players
who have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts







upon the heel of the last scene the cosmopolitan enters the
barber's shop a benediction on his lips


 bless you barber

now owing to the lateness of the hour the barber
had been all alone until within the ten minutes last
passed when finding himself rather dullish company to
himself he thought he would have a good time with
souter john and tam o'shanter otherwise called somnus
and morpheus two very good fellows though one
was not very bright and the other an arrant rattlebrain
who though much listened to by some no wise
man would believe under oath

in short with back presented to the glare of his
lamps and so to the door the honest barber was taking
what are called cat-naps and dreaming in his chair so
that upon suddenly hearing the benediction above pronounced
in tones not unangelic starting up half awake
he stared before him but saw nothing for the stranger
stood behind what with cat-naps dreams and bewilderments
therefore the voice seemed a sort of spiritual
manifestation to him so that for the moment




he stood all agape eyes fixed and one arm in the
air

why barber are you reaching up to catch birds
there with salt

ah turning round disenchanted it is only a
man then

 only a man as if to be but man were nothing
but don't be too sure what i am you call me man
just as the townsfolk called the angels who in man's
form came to lot's house just as the jew rustics called
the devils who in man's form haunted the tombs
you can conclude nothing absolute from the human
form barber

but i can conclude something from that sort of
talk with that sort of dress shrewdly thought the
barber eying him with regained self-possession and not
without some latent touch of apprehension at being
alone with him what was passing in his mind seemed
divined by the other who now more rationally and
gravely and as if he expected it should be attended to
said whatever else you may conclude upon it is
my desire that you conclude to give me a good shave
at the same time loosening his neck-cloth are you
competent to a good shave barber

no broker more so sir answered the barber whom
the business-like proposition instinctively made confine
to business-ends his views of the visitor

broker what has a broker to do with lather
a broker i have always understood to be a worthy dealer
in certain papers and metals




he he taking him now for some dry sort of joker
whose jokes he being a customer it might be as well
to appreciate he he you understand well enough
sir take this seat sir laying his hand on a great
stuffed chair high-backed and high-armed crimsoncovered
and raised on a sort of dais and which seemed
but to lack a canopy and quarterings to make it in
aspect quite a throne take this seat sir

thank you sitting down and now pray explain
that about the broker but look look   what's
this suddenly rising and pointing with his long pipe
towards a gilt notification swinging among colored flypapers
from the ceiling like a tavern sign no trust 
no trust means distrust distrust means no confidence
barber turning upon him excitedly what fell suspiciousness
prompts this scandalous confession my
life stamping his foot if but to tell a dog that you
have no confidence in him be matter for affront to the
dog what an insult to take that way the whole haughty
race of man by the beard by my heart sir but at
least you are valiant backing the spleen of thersites
with the pluck of agamemnon

your sort of talk sir is not exactly in my line
said the barber rather ruefully being now again hopeless
of his customer and not without return of uneasiness
not in my line sir he emphatically repeated

but the taking of mankind by the nose is a habit
barber which i sadly fear has insensibly bred in you a
disrespect for man for how indeed may respectful
conceptions of him coexist with the perpetual habit of




taking him by the nose but tell me though i too
clearly see the import of your notification i do not as
yet perceive the object what is it

now you speak a little in my line sir said the
barber not unrelieved at this return to plain talk
that notification i find very useful sparing me much
work which would not pay yes i lost a good deal
off and on before putting that up gratefully glancing
towards it

but what is its object surely you don't mean to
say in so many words that you have no confidence
for instance now flinging aside his neck-cloth throwing
back his blouse and reseating himself on the tonsorial
throne at sight of which proceeding the barber
mechanically filled a cup with hot water from a copper
vessel over a spirit-lamp for instance now suppose i
say to you barber my dear barber unhappily i have
no small change by me to-night but shave me and
depend upon your money to-morrow   suppose i should
say that now you would put trust in me wouldn't
you you would have confidence

seeing that it is you sir with complaisance
replied the barber now mixing the lather seeing that
it is you sir i won't answer that question no need to

of course of course   in that view but as a supposition   
you would have confidence in me wouldn't
you

why   yes yes

then why that sign

ah sir all people ain't like you was the smooth




reply at the same time as if smoothly to close the
debate beginning smoothly to apply the lather which
operation however was by a motion protested against
by the subject but only out of a desire to rejoin which
was done in these words

all people ain't like me then i must be either
better or worse than most people worse you could
not mean no barber you could not mean that hardly
that it remains then that you think me better than
most people but that i ain't vain enough to believe
though from vanity i confess i could never yet by my
best wrestlings entirely free myself nor indeed to be
frank am i at bottom over anxious to   this same vanity
barber being so harmless so useful so comfortable so
pleasingly preposterous a passion

very true sir and upon my honor sir you talk
very well but the lather is getting a little cold sir

better cold lather barber than a cold heart why
that cold sign ah i don't wonder you try to shirk
the confession you feel in your soul how ungenerous
a hint is there and yet barber now that i look into
your eyes   which somehow speak to me of the mother
that must have so often looked into them before me   i
dare say though you may not think it that the spirit of
that notification is not one with your nature for look
now setting business views aside regarding the thing
in an abstract light in short supposing a case barber
supposing i say you see a stranger his face accidentally
averted but his visible part very respectable-looking
what now barber   i put it to your conscience to your




charity   what would be your impression of that man
in a moral point of view being in a signal sense a
stranger would you for that signally set him down for
a knave

certainly not sir by no means cried the barber
humanely resentful

you would upon the face of him   

hold sir said the barber nothing about the face
you remember sir that is out of sight

i forgot that well then you would upon the
back of him conclude him to be not improbably some
worthy sort of person in short an honest man wouldn't
you

not unlikely i should sir

well now   don't be so impatient with your brush
barber   suppose that honest man meet you by night in
some dark corner of the boat where his face would still
remain unseen asking you to trust him for a shave   
how then

wouldn't trust him sir

but is not an honest man to be trusted

why   why   yes sir

there don't you see now

see what asked the disconcerted barber rather
vexedly

why you stand self-contradicted barber don't
you

no doggedly

barber gravely and after a pause of concern
the enemies of our race have a saying that insincerity




is the most universal and inveterate vice of man   the
lasting bar to real amelioration whether of individuals
or of the world don't you now barber by your stubbornness
on this occasion give color to such a calumny

hity-tity cried the barber losing patience and
with it respect stubbornness then clattering
round the brush in the cup will you be shaved or
won't you

barber i will be shaved and with pleasure but
pray don't raise your voice that way why now if
you go through life gritting your teeth in that fashion
what a comfortless time you will have

i take as much comfort in this world as you or any
other man cried the barber whom the other's sweetness
of temper seemed rather to exasperate than soothe

to resent the imputation of anything like unhappiness
i have often observed to be peculiar to certain
orders of men said the other pensively and half to
himself just as to be indifferent to that imputation
from holding happiness but for a secondary good and inferior
grace i have observed to be equally peculiar to
other kinds of men pray barber innocently looking
up which think you is the superior creature

all this sort of talk cried the barber still unmollified
is as i told you once before not in my line in
a few minutes i shall shut up this shop will you be
shaved

shave away barber what hinders turning up
his face like a flower




the shaving began and proceeded in silence till at
length it became necessary to prepare to relather a
little   affording an opportunity for resuming the subject
which on one side was not let slip

barber with a kind of cautious kindliness feeling
his way barber now have a little patience with me
do trust me i wish not to offend i have been thinking
over that supposed case of the man with the averted
face and i cannot rid my mind of the impression that
by your opposite replies to my questions at the time
you showed yourself much of a piece with a good many
other men   that is you have confidence and then again
you have none now what i would ask is do you
think it sensible standing for a sensible man one foot
on confidence and the other on suspicion don't you
think barber that you ought to elect don't you
think consistency requires that you should either say i
have confidence in all men and take down your notification
or else say i suspect all men and keep it up

this dispassionate if not deferential way of putting
the case did not fail to impress the barber and proportionately
conciliate him likewise from its pointedness
it served to make him thoughtful for instead of going
to the copper vessel for more water as he had purposed
he halted half-way towards it and after a pause cup in
hand said sir i hope you would not do me injustice
i don't say and can't say and wouldn't say that
i suspect all men but i do say that strangers are not
to be trusted and so pointing up to the sign no
trust




but look now i beg barber rejoined the other
deprecatingly not presuming too much upon the barber's
changed temper look now to say that strangers
are not to be trusted does not that imply something
like saying that mankind is not to be trusted
for the mass of mankind are they not necessarily
strangers to each individual man come come
my friend winningly you are no timon to hold
the mass of mankind untrustworthy take down
your notification it is misanthropical much the same
sign that timon traced with charcoal on the forehead of
a skull stuck over his cave take it down barber
take it down to-night trust men just try the experiment
of trusting men for this one little trip come
now i'm a philanthropist and will insure you against
losing a cent

the barber shook his head dryly and answered sir
you must excuse me i have a family






very charming


 so you are a philanthropist sir added the barber
with an illuminated look that accounts then for all
very odd sort of man the philanthropist you are the
second one sir i have seen very odd sort of man
indeed the philanthropist ah sir again meditatively
stirring in the shaving-cup i sadly fear lest you
philanthropists know better what goodness is than
what men are then eying him as if he were some
strange creature behind cage-bars so you are a philanthropist
sir

i am philanthropos and love mankind and what
is more than you do barber i trust them

here the barber causally recalled to his business
would have replenished his shaving-cup but finding
now that on his last visit to the water-vessel he had not
replaced it over the lamp he did so now and while
waiting for it to heat again became almost as sociable
as if the heating water were meant for whisky-punch
and almost as pleasantly garrulous as the pleasant barbers
in romances

sir said he taking a throne beside his customer




for in a row there were three thrones on the dais as
for the three kings of cologne those patron saints of the
barber sir you say you trust men well i suppose
i might share some of your trust were it not for
this trade that i follow too much letting me in behind
the scenes

i think i understand with a saddened look and
much the same thing i have heard from persons in
pursuits different from yours   from the lawyer from
the congressman from the editor not to mention others
each with a strange kind of melancholy vanity claiming
for his vocation the distinction of affording the
surest inlets to the conviction that man is no better
than he should be all of which testimony if reliable
would by mutual corroboration justify some disturbance
in a good man's mind but no no it is a mistake   all
a mistake

true sir very true assented the barber

glad to hear that brightening up

not so fast sir said the barber i agree with you
in thinking that the lawyer and the congressman and
the editor are in error but only in so far as each claims
peculiar facilities for the sort of knowledge in question
because you see sir the truth is that every trade or
pursuit which brings one into contact with the facts
sir such trade or pursuit is equally an avenue to those
facts

 how exactly is that

why sir in my opinion   and for the last twenty
years i have at odd times turned the matter over some in




my mind   he who comes to know man will not remain
in ignorance of man i think i am not rash in saying
that am i sir

barber you talk like an oracle   obscurely barber
obscurely

well sir with some self-complacency the barber
has always been held an oracle but as for the obscurity
that i don't admit

but pray now by your account what precisely
may be this mysterious knowledge gained in your trade
i grant you indeed as before hinted that your trade
imposing on you the necessity of functionally tweaking
the noses of mankind is in that respect unfortunate
very much so nevertheless a well-regulated
imagination should be proof even to such a provocation
to improper conceits but what i want to
learn from you barber is how does the mere handling
of the outside of men's heads lead you to distrust the
inside of their hearts

what sir to say nothing more can one be forever
dealing in macassar oil hair dyes cosmetics false moustaches
wigs and toupees and still believe that men are
wholly what they look to be what think you sir are a
thoughtful barber's reflections when behind a careful
curtain he shaves the thin dead stubble off a head and
then dismisses it to the world radiant in curling auburn
to contrast the shamefaced air behind the
curtain the fearful looking forward to being possibly
discovered there by a prying acquaintance with the
cheerful assurance and challenging pride with which




the same man steps forth again a gay deception into
the street while some honest shock-headed fellow
humbly gives him the wall ah sir they may talk of
the courage of truth but my trade teaches me that
truth sometimes is sheepish lies lies sir brave lies
are the lions

you twist the moral barber you sadly twist it
look now take it this way a modest man thrust out
naked into the street would he not be abashed take
him in and clothe him would not his confidence be
restored and in either case is any reproach involved
now what is true of the whole holds proportionably
true of the part the bald head is a nakedness which
the wig is a coat to to feel uneasy at the possibility
of the exposure of one's nakedness at top and to feel
comforted by the consciousness of having it clothed   
these feelings instead of being dishonorable to a bold
man do in fact but attest a proper respect for himself
and his fellows and as for the deception you may as
well call the fine roof of a fine chateau a deception
since like a fine wig it also is an artificial cover to the
head and equally in the common eye decorates the
wearer   i have confuted you my dear barber i have
confounded you

pardon said the barber but i do not see that you
have his coat and his roof no man pretends to palm
off as a part of himself but the bald man palms off hair
not his for his own

not his barber if he have fairly purchased his
hair the law will protect him in its ownership even




against the claims of the head on which it grew but
it cannot be that you believe what you say barber
you talk merely for the humor i could not think so
of you as to suppose that you would contentedly deal
in the impostures you condemn

ah sir i must live

and can't you do that without sinning against your
conscience as you believe take up some other calling

wouldn't mend the matter much sir

do you think then barber that in a certain point
all the trades and callings of men are much on a par
fatal indeed raising his hand inexpressibly dreadful
the trade of the barber if to such conclusions it
necessarily leads barber eying him not without
emotion you appear to me not so much a misbeliever
as a man misled now let me set you on the right
track let me restore you to trust in human nature and
by no other means than the very trade that has brought
you to suspect it

you mean sir you would have me try the experiment
of taking down that notification again pointing
to it with his brush but dear me while i sit chatting
here the water boils over

with which words and such a well-pleased sly snug
expression as they say some men have when they think
their little stratagem has succeeded he hurried to the
copper vessel and soon had his cup foaming up with
white bubbles as if it were a mug of new ale

meantime the other would have fain gone on with




the discourse but the cunning barber lathered him with
so generous a brush so piled up the foam on him that
his face looked like the yeasty crest of a billow and vain
to think of talking under it as for a drowning priest in
the sea to exhort his fellow-sinners on a raft nothing
would do but he must keep his mouth shut doubtless
the interval was not in a meditative way unimproved
for upon the traces of the operation being at last removed
the cosmopolitan rose and for added refreshment
washed his face and hands and having generally
readjusted himself began at last addressing the barber
in a manner different singularly so from his previous
one hard to say exactly what the manner was any
more than to hint it was a sort of magical in a benign
way not wholly unlike the manner fabled or otherwise
of certain creatures in nature which have the power of
persuasive fascination   the power of holding another
creature by the button of the eye as it were despite
the serious disinclination and indeed earnest protest
of the victim with this manner the conclusion of the
matter was not out of keeping for in the end all argument
and expostulation proved vain the barber being
irresistibly persuaded to agree to try for the remainder
of the present trip the experiment of trusting men as
both phrased it true to save his credit as a free agent
he was loud in averring that it was only for the novelty
of the thing that he so agreed and he required the other
as before volunteered to go security to him against any
loss that might ensue but still the fact remained that
he engaged to trust men a thing he had before said he




would not do at least not unreservedly still the more
to save his credit he now insisted upon it as a last point
that the agreement should be put in black and white
especially the security part the other made no demur
pen ink and paper were provided and grave as any
notary the cosmopolitan sat down but ere taking the
pen glanced up at the notification and said first
down with that sign barber   timon's sign there down
with it

this being in the agreement was done   though a little
reluctantly   with an eye to the future the sign being
carefully put away in a drawer

now then for the writing said the cosmopolitan
squaring himself ah with a sigh i shall make a
poor lawyer i fear ain't used you see barber to a
business which ignoring the principle of honor holds no
nail fast till clinched strange barber taking up the
blank paper that such flimsy stuff as this should make
such strong hawsers vile hawsers too barber
starting up i won't put it in black and white it
were a reflection upon our joint honor i will take your
word and you shall take mine

but your memory may be none of the best sir well
for you on your side to have it in black and white just
for a memorandum like you know

that indeed yes and it would help your memory
too wouldn't it barber yours on your side being a
little weak too i dare say ah barber how ingenious
we human beings are and how kindly we reciprocate
each other's little delicacies don't we what better




proof now that we are kind considerate fellows with
responsive fellow-feelings   eh barber but to business
let me see what's your name barber

william cream sir

pondering a moment he began to write and after
some corrections leaned back and read aloud the following

 agreement
between
 frank goodman philanthropist and citizen of the world
and
 william cream barber of the mississippi steamer fidle

the first hereby agrees to make good to the last any loss that may
come from his trusting mankind in the way of his vocation for the residue
of the present trip provided that william cream keep out of
sight for the given term his notification of no trust and by no other
mode convey any the least hint or intimation tending to discourage
men from soliciting trust from him in the way of his vocation for the
time above specified but on the contrary he do by all proper and
reasonable words gestures manners and looks evince a perfect confidence
in all men especially strangers otherwise this agreement to be
void

done in good faith this st day of april   at a quarter to
twelve o'clock p m in the shop of said william cream on board the
said boat fidle

there barber will that do

that will do said the barber only now put down
your name

both signatures being affixed the question was started
by the barber who should have custody of the instrument
which point however he settled for himself by
proposing that both should go together to the captain




and give the document into his hands   the barber hinting
that this would be a safe proceeding because the
captain was necessarily a party disinterested and what
was more could not from the nature of the present
case make anything by a breach of trust all of which
was listened to with some surprise and concern

why barber said the cosmopolitan this don't
show the right spirit for me i have confidence in the
captain purely because he is a man but he shall have
nothing to do with our affair for if you have no confidence
in me barber i have in you there keep the
paper yourself handing it magnanimously

very good said the barber and now nothing remains
but for me to receive the cash

though the mention of that word or any of its singularly
numerous equivalents in serious neighborhood
to a requisition upon one's purse is attended with a
more or less noteworthy effect upon the human countenance
producing in many an abrupt fall of it   in others
a writhing and screwing up of the features to a point
not undistressing to behold in some attended with a
blank pallor and fatal consternation   yet no trace of
any of these symptoms was visible upon the countenance
of the cosmopolitan notwithstanding nothing could be
more sudden and unexpected than the barber's demand

you speak of cash barber pray in what connection

in a nearer one sir answered the barber less
blandly than i thought the man with the sweet voice




stood who wanted me to trust him once for a shave on
the score of being a sort of thirteenth cousin

indeed and what did you say to him

i said thank you sir but i don't see the connection

how could you so unsweetly answer one with a
sweet voice

because i recalled what the son of sirach says in
the true book an enemy speaketh sweetly with his
lips and so i did what the son of sirach advises in such
cases i believed not his many words

what barber do you say that such cynical sort of
things are in the true book by which of course you
mean the bible

yes and plenty more to the same effect read the
book of proverbs

that's strange now barber for i never happen to
have met with those passages you cite before i go
to bed this night i'll inspect the bible i saw on the
cabin-table to-day but mind you mustn't quote the
true book that way to people coming in here it would
be impliedly a violation of the contract but you don't
know how glad i feel that you have for one while signed
off all that sort of thing

no sir not unless you down with the cash

cash again what do you mean

why in this paper here you engage sir to insure
me against a certain loss and   

certain is it so certain you are going to lose

why that way of taking the word may not be




amiss but i didn't mean it so i meant a certain loss
you understand a certain loss that is to say a certain
loss now then sir what use your mere writing
and saying you will insure me unless beforehand you
place in my hands a money-pledge sufficient to that
end

i see the material pledge

yes and i will put it low say fifty dollars

now what sort of a beginning is this you barber
for a given time engage to trust man to put confidence
in men and for your first step make a demand
implying no confidence in the very man you engage
with but fifty dollars is nothing and i would let you
have it cheerfully only i unfortunately happen to have
but little change with me just now

but you have money in your trunk though

to be sure but you see   in fact barber you
must be consistent no i won't let you have the money
now i won't let you violate the inmost spirit of our
contract that way so good-night and i will see you
again

stay sir   humming and hawing   you have forgotten
something

handkerchief   gloves no forgotten nothing
good-night

stay sir   the   the shaving

ah i did forget that but now that it strikes me
i shan't pay you at present look at your agreement
you must trust tut against loss you hold the guarantee
good-night my dear barber




with which words he sauntered off leaving the barber
in a maze staring after

but it holding true in fascination as in natural philosophy
that nothing can act where it is not so the
barber was not long now in being restored to his self-possession
and senses the first evidence of which perhaps
was that drawing forth his notification from the drawer
he put it back where it belonged while as for the
agreement that he tore up which he felt the more free
to do from the impression that in all human probability
he would never again see the person who had drawn it
whether that impression proved well-founded or not
does not appear but in after days telling the night's
adventure to his friends the worthy barber always
spoke of his queer customer as the man-charmer   as
certain east indians are called snake-charmers   and all
his friends united in thinking him quite an original







the text of discourse which will be sure of receiving more
or less attention from those readers who do not skip it


una

 quite an original a phrase we fancy rather
oftener used by the young or the unlearned or the untraveled
than by the old or the well-read or the man
who has made the grand tour certainly the sense of
originality exists at its highest in an infant and probably
at its lowest in him who has completed the circle
of the sciences

as for original characters in fiction a grateful reader
will on meeting with one keep the anniversary of that
day true we sometimes hear of an author who at
one creation produces some two or three score such
characters it may be possible but they can hardly
be original in the sense that hamlet is or don quixote
or milton's satan that is to say they are not in a
thorough sense original at all they are novel or
singular or striking or captivating or all four at
once

more likely they are what are called odd characters
but for that are no more original than what is called




an odd genius in his way is but if original whence
came they or where did the novelist pick them
up

where does any novelist pick up any character
for the most part in town to be sure every great
town is a kind of man-show where the novelist goes for
his stock just as the agriculturist goes to the cattleshow
for his but in the one fair new species of quadrupeds
are hardly more rare than in the other are new
species of characters   that is original ones their
rarity may still the more appear from this that while
characters merely singular imply but singular forms
so to speak original ones truly so imply original
instincts

in short a due conception of what is to be held for
this sort of personage in fiction would make him almost
as much of a prodigy there as in real history is a new
law-giver a revolutionizing philosopher or the founder
of a new religion

in nearly all the original characters loosely accounted
such in works of invention there is discernible
something prevailingly local or of the age which circumstance
of itself would seem to invalidate the claim
judged by the principles here suggested

furthermore if we consider what is popularly held
to entitle characters in fiction to being deemed original
is but something personal   confined to itself the character
sheds not its characteristic on its surroundings
whereas the original character essentially such is like
a revolving drummond light raying away from itself




all round it   everything is lit by it everything starts
up to it mark how it is with hamlet so that in certain
minds there follows upon the adequate conception
of such a character an effect in its way akin to that
which in genesis attends upon the beginning of
things

for much the same reason that there is but one
planet to one orbit so can there be but one such original
character to one work of invention two would
conflict to chaos in this view to say that there are
more than one to a book is good presumption there is
none at all but for new singular striking odd eccentric
and all sorts of entertaining and instructive characters
a good fiction may be full of them to produce
such characters an author beside other things must
have seen much and seen through much to produce
but one original character he must have had much
luck

there would seem but one point in common between
this sort of phenomenon in fiction and all other sorts
it cannot be born in the author's imagination   it being
as true in literature as in zoology that all life is from
the egg

in the endeavor to show if possible the impropriety
of the phrase quite an original as applied by the barber's
friends we have at unawares been led into a
dissertation bordering upon the prosy perhaps upon the
smoky if so the best use the smoke can be turned
to will be by retiring under cover of it in good trim
as may be to the story



the cosmopolitan increases in seriousness


in the middle of the gentlemen's cabin burned a solar
lamp swung from the ceiling and whose shade of
ground glass was all round fancifully variegated in
transparency with the image of a horned altar from
which flames rose alternate with the figure of a robed
man his head encircled by a halo the light of this
lamp after dazzlingly striking on marble snow-white
and round   the slab of a centre-table beneath   on all
sides went rippling off with ever-diminishing distinctness
till like circles from a stone dropped in water the
rays died dimly away in the furthest nook of the
place

here and there true to their place but not to their
function swung other lamps barren planets which
had either gone out from exhaustion or been extinguished
by such occupants of berths as the light annoyed
or who wanted to sleep not see

by a perverse man in a berth not remote the remaining
lamp would have been extinguished as well had
not a steward forbade saying that the commands of the
captain required it to be kept burning till the natural




light of day should come to relieve it this steward who
like many in his vocation was apt to be a little freespoken
at times had been provoked by the man's pertinacity
to remind him not only of the sad consequences
which might upon occasion ensue from the cabin being
left in darkness but also of the circumstance that
in a place full of strangers to show one's self anxious to
produce darkness there such an anxiety was to say the
least not becoming so the lamp   last survivor of
many   burned on inwardly blessed by those in some
berths and inwardly execrated by those in others

keeping his lone vigils beneath his lone lamp which
lighted his book on the table sat a clean comely old
man his head snowy as the marble and a countenance
like that which imagination ascribes to good simeon
when having at last beheld the master of faith he blessed
him and departed in peace from his hale look of
greenness in winter and his hands ingrained with the
tan less apparently of the present summer than of
accumulated ones past the old man seemed a well-to-do
farmer happily dismissed after a thrifty life of activity
from the fields to the fireside   one of those who
at three-score-and-ten are fresh-hearted as at fifteen
to whom seclusion gives a boon more blessed than
knowledge and at last sends them to heaven untainted
by the world because ignorant of it just as a countryman
putting up at a london inn and never stirring out
of it as a sight-seer will leave london at last without
once being lost in its fog or soiled by its mud

redolent from the barber's shop as any bridegroom




tripping to the bridal chamber might come and by his
look of cheeriness seeming to dispense a sort of morning
through the night in came the cosmopolitan but marking
the old man and how he was occupied he toned
himself down and trod softly and took a seat on the
other side of the table and said nothing still there
was a kind of waiting expression about him

sir said the old man after looking up puzzled at
him a moment sir said he one would think this
was a coffee-house and it was war-time and i had
a newspaper here with great news and the only copy
to be had you sit there looking at me so eager

and so you have good news there sir   the very
best of good news

too good to be true here came from one of the
curtained berths

hark said the cosmopolitan some one talks
in his sleep

yes said the old man and you   you seem to be
talking in a dream why speak you sir of news and
all that when you must see this is a book i have here   
the bible not a newspaper

i know that and when you are through with it   
but not a moment sooner   i will thank you for it it
belongs to the boat i believe   a present from a society

oh take it take it

nay sir i did not mean to touch you at all i
simply stated the fact in explanation of my waiting here   
nothing more read on sir or you will distress me




this courtesy was not without effect removing his
spectacles and saying he had about finished his chapter
the old man kindly presented the volume which was
received with thanks equally kind after reading for
some minutes until his expression merged from attentiveness
into seriousness and from that into a kind of
pain the cosmopolitan slowly laid down the book and
turning to the old man who thus far had been watching
him with benign curiosity said can you my aged
friend resolve me a doubt   a disturbing doubt

there are doubts sir replied the old man with a
changed countenance there are doubts sir which
if man have them it is not man that can solve
them

true but look now what my doubt is i am one
who thinks well of man i love man i have confidence
in man but what was told me not a half-hour
since i was told that i would find it written   believe
not his many words   an enemy speaketh sweetly
with his lips   and also i was told that i would find a
good deal more to the same effect and all in this book
i could not think it and coming here to look for myself
what do i read not only just what was quoted
but also as was engaged more to the same purpose
such as this with much communication he will
tempt thee he will smile upon thee and speak thee fair
and say what wantest thou if thou be for his profit
he will use thee he will make thee bear and will not
be sorry for it observe and take good heed when
thou hearest these things awake in thy sleep




who's that describing the confidence-man here
came from the berth again

awake in his sleep sure enough ain't he said the
cosmopolitan again looking off in surprise same
voice as before ain't it strange sort of dreamy man
that which is his berth pray

never mind him sir said the old man anxiously
but tell me truly did you indeed read from the book
just now

i did with changed air and gall and wormwood
it is to me a truster in man to me a philanthropist

why moved you don't mean to say that what
you repeated is really down there man and boy i
have read the good book this seventy years and don't
remember seeing anything like that let me see it
rising earnestly and going round to him

there it is and there   and there   turning over
the leaves and pointing to the sentences one by one
there   all down in the wisdom of jesus the son of
sirach

ah cried the old man brightening up now i
know look turning the leaves forward and back till
all the old testament lay flat on one side and all the
new testament flat on the other while in his fingers he
supported vertically the portion between look sir all
this to the right is certain truth and all this to the left
is certain truth but all i hold in my hand here is
apocrypha

apocrypha 

yes and there's the word in black and white




pointing to it and what says the word it says as
much as not warranted for what do college men say
of anything of that sort they say it is apocryphal
the word itself i've heard from the pulpit implies
something of uncertain credit so if your disturbance
be raised from aught in this apocrypha again taking
up the pages in that case think no more of it for it's
apocrypha

what's that about the apocalypse here a third
time came from the berth

he's seeing visions now ain't he said the cosmopolitan
once more looking in the direction of the interruption
but sir resuming i cannot tell you how
thankful i am for your reminding me about the apocrypha
here for the moment its being such escaped me
fact is when all is bound up together it's sometimes
confusing the uncanonical part should be bound distinct
and now that i think of it how well did those
learned doctors who rejected for us this whole book of
sirach i never read anything so calculated to destroy
man's confidence in man this son of sirach even says   
i saw it but just now take heed of thy friends not
observe thy seeming friends thy hypocritical friends
thy false friends but thy friends thy real friends   that
is to say not the truest friend in the world is to be implicitly
trusted can rochefoucault equal that i
should not wonder if his view of human nature like
machiavelli's was taken from this son of sirach and
to call it wisdom   the wisdom of the son of sirach
wisdom indeed what an ugly thing wisdom must




be give me the folly that dimples the cheek say i
rather than the wisdom that curdles the blood but
no no it ain't wisdom it's apocrypha as you say sir
for how can that be trustworthy that teaches distrust

i tell you what it is here cried the same voice as
before only more in less of mockery if you two don't
know enough to sleep don't be keeping wiser men
awake and if you want to know what wisdom is go
find it under your blankets

wisdom cried another voice with a borgue
arrah and is't wisdom the two geese are gabbling
about all this while to bed with ye ye divils and
don't be after burning your fingers with the likes of
wisdom

we must talk lower said the old man i fear we
have annoyed these good people

i should be sorry if wisdom annoyed any one said
the other but we will lower our voices as you say
to resume taking the thing as i did can you be surprised
at my uneasiness in reading passages so charged
with the spirit of distrust

no sir i am not surprised said the old man then
added from what you say i see you are something
of my way of thinking   you think that to distrust the
creature is a kind of distrusting of the creator well
my young friend what is it this is rather late for you
to be about what do you want of me

these questions were put to a boy in the fragment of
an old linen coat bedraggled and yellow who coming




in from the deck barefooted on the soft carpet had been
unheard all pointed and fluttering the rags of the
little fellow's red-flannel shirt mixed with those of his
yellow coat flamed about him like the painted flames in
the robes of a victim in auto-da-fe his face too wore
such a polish of seasoned grime that his sloe-eyes
sparkled from out it like lustrous sparks in fresh coal
he was a juvenile peddler or marchand as the polite
french might have called him of travelers conveniences
and having no allotted sleeping-place had in
his wanderings about the boat spied through glass
doors the two in the cabin and late though it was
thought it might never be too much so for turning a
penny

among other things he carried a curious affair   a
miniature mahogany door hinged to its frame and suitably
furnished in all respects but one which will shortly
appear this little door he now meaningly held before
the old man who after staring at it a while said go
thy ways with thy toys child

now may i never get so old and wise as that comes
to laughed the boy through his grime and by so
doing disclosing leopard-like teeth like those of murillo's
wild beggar-boy's

the divils are laughing now are they here came
the brogue from the berth what do the divils find to
laugh about in wisdom begorrah to bed with ye ye
divils and no more of ye

you see child you have disturbed that person
said the old man you mustn't laugh any more




ah now said the cosmopolitan don't pray say
that don't let him think that poor laughter is persecuted
for a fool in this world

well said the old man to the boy you must at
any rate speak very low

yes that wouldn't be amiss perhaps said the
cosmopolitan but my fine fellow you were about
saying something to my aged friend here what was
it

oh with a lowered voice coolly opening and shutting
his little door only this when i kept a toystand
at the fair in cincinnati last month i sold more
than one old man a child's rattle

no doubt of it said the old man i myself often
buy such things for my little grandchildren

but these old men i talk of were old bachelors

the old man stared at him a moment then whispering
to the cosmopolitan strange boy this sort of
simple ain't he don't know much hey

not much said the boy or i wouldn't be so
ragged

why child what sharp ears you have exclaimed
the old man

if they were duller i would hear less ill of myself
said the boy

you seem pretty wise my lad said the cosmopolitan
why don't you sell your wisdom and buy a
coat

faith said the boy that's what i did to-day and
this is the coat that the prince of my wisdom bought




but won't you trade see now it is not the door i
want to sell i only carry the door round for a specimen
like look now sir standing the thing up on the
table supposing this little door is your state-room
door well opening it you go in for the night
you close your door behind you   thus now is all
safe

i suppose so child said the old man

of course it is my fine fellow said the cosmopolitan

all safe well now about two o'clock in the
morning say a soft-handed gentleman comes softly and
tries the knob here   thus in creeps my soft-handed
gentleman and hey presto how comes on the soft
cash

i see i see child said the old man your fine
gentleman is a fine thief and there's no lock to your
little door to keep him out with which words he
peered at it more closely than before

well now again showing his white teeth well
now some of you old folks are knowing uns sure
enough but now comes the great invention producing
a small steel contrivance very simple but ingenious
and which being clapped on the inside of the little
door secured it as with a bolt there now admiringly
holding it off at arm's-length there now let
that soft-handed gentleman come now a softly trying
this little knob here and let him keep a trying till he
finds his head as soft as his hand buy the traveler's
patent lock sir only twenty-five cents




dear me cried the old man this beats printing
yes child i will have one and use it this very
night

with the phlegm of an old banker pouching the
change the boy now turned to the other sell you
one sir

excuse me my fine fellow but i never use such
blacksmiths things

those who give the blacksmith most work seldom
do said the boy tipping him a wink expressive of a
degree of indefinite knowingness not uninteresting to
consider in one of his years but the wink was not
marked by the old man nor to all appearances by him
for whom it was intended

now then said the boy again addressing the old
man with your traveler's lock on your door to-night
you will think yourself all safe won't you

i think i will child

but how about the window

dear me the window child i never thought of
that i must see to that

never you mind about the window said the boy
nor to be honor bright about the traveler's lock either
though i ain't sorry for selling one do you just buy
one of these little jokers producing a number of suspender-like
objects which he dangled before the old
man money-belts sir only fifty cents

money-belt never heard of such a thing

a sort of pocket-book said the boy only a safer
sort very good for travelers




oh a pocket-book queer looking pocket-books
though seems to me ain't they rather long and narrow
for pocket-books

they go round the waist sir inside said the boy
door open or locked wide awake on your feet or fast
asleep in your chair impossible to be robbed with a
money-belt

i see i see it would be hard to rob one's money-belt
and i was told to-day the mississippi is a bad
river for pick-pockets how much are they

only fifty cents sir

i'll take one there

thank-ee and now there's a present for ye with
which drawing from his breast a batch of little papers
he threw one before the old man who looking at it read
 counterfeit detector 

very good thing said the boy i give it to all my
customers who trade seventy-five cents worth best
present can be made them sell you a money-belt
sir turning to the cosmopolitan

excuse me my fine fellow but i never use that
sort of thing my money i carry loose

loose bait ain't bad said the boy look a lie and
find the truth don't care about a counterfeit detector
do ye or is the wind east d'ye think

child said the old man in some concern you
mustn't sit up any longer it affects your mind there go
away go to bed

if i had some people's brains to lie on i would
said the boy but planks is hard you know




go child   go go

yes child   yes yes said the boy with which
roguish parody by way of cong he scraped back his
hard foot on the woven flowers of the carpet much as a
mischievous steer in may scrapes back his horny hoof
in the pasture and then with a flourish of his hat   
which like the rest of his tatters was thanks to hard
times a belonging beyond his years though not beyond
his experience being a grown man's cast-off beaver   
turned and with the air of a young caffre quitted the
place

that's a strange boy said the old man looking
after him i wonder who's his mother and whether
she knows what late hours he keeps

the probability is observed the other that his
mother does not know but if you remember sir you
were saying something when the boy interrupted you
with his door

so i was   let me see unmindful of his purchases
for the moment what now was it what was that
i was saying do you remember

not perfectly sir but if i am not mistaken it was
something like this you hoped you did not distrust the
creature for that would imply distrust of the creator

yes that was something like it mechanically and
unintelligently letting his eye fall now on his purchases

pray will you put your money in your belt to-night

it's best ain't it with a slight start never




too late to be cautious beware of pick-pockets is
all over the boat

yes and it must have been the son of sirach or
some other morbid cynic who put them there but
that's not to the purpose since you are minded to it
pray sir let me help you about the belt i think that
between us we can make a secure thing of it

oh no no no said the old man not unperturbed
no no i wouldn't trouble you for the world then
nervously folding up the belt and i won't be so impolite
as to do it for myself before you either but
now that i think of it after a pause carefully taking
a little wad from a remote corner of his vest pocket
here are two bills they gave me at st louis yesterday
no doubt they are all right but just to pass
time i'll compare them with the detector here blessed
boy to make me such a present public benefactor
that little boy

laying the detector square before him on the table
he then with something of the air of an officer bringing
by the collar a brace of culprits to the bar placed the
two bills opposite the detector upon which the examination
began lasting some time prosecuted with
no small research and vigilance the forefinger of the
right hand proving of lawyer-like efficacy in tracing out
and pointing the evidence whichever way it might go

after watching him a while the cosmopolitan said in
a formal voice well what say you mr foreman
guilty or not guilty   not guilty ain't it

i don't know i don't know returned the old man




perplexed there's so many marks of all sorts to go by
it makes it a kind of uncertain here now is this bill
touching one it looks to be a three dollar bill on
the vicksburgh trust and insurance banking company
well the detector says   

but why in this case care what it says trust and
insurance what more would you have

no but the detector says among fifty other things
that if a good bill it must have thickened here and
there into the substance of the paper little wavy spots
of red and it says they must have a kind of silky feel
being made by the lint of a red silk handkerchief stirred
up in the paper-maker's vat   the paper being made to
order for the company

well and is   

stay but then it adds that sign is not always to
be relied on for some good bills get so worn the red
marks get rubbed out and that's the case with my
bill here   see how old it is   or else it's a counterfeit or
else   i don't see right   or else   dear dear me   i don't
know what else to think

what a peck of trouble that detector makes for you
now believe me the bill is good don't be so distrustful
proves what i've always thought that much of
the want of confidence in these days is owing to these
counterfeit detectors you see on every desk and counter
puts people up to suspecting good bills throw it
away i beg if only because of the trouble it breeds
you

no it's troublesome but i think i'll keep it   stay




now here's another sign it says that if the bill is good it
must have in one corner mixed in with the vignette the
figure of a goose very small indeed all but microscopic
and for added precaution like the figure of napoleon
outlined by the tree not observable even if magnified
unless the attention is directed to it now pore over it
as i will i can't see this goose

can't see the goose why i can and a famous
goose it is there reaching over and pointing to
a spot in the vignette

i don't see it   dear me   i don't see the goose is
it a real goose

a perfect goose beautiful goose

dear dear i don't see it

then throw that detector away i say again it
only makes you purblind don't you see what a wildgoose
chase it has led you the bill is good throw
the detector away

no it ain't so satisfactory as i thought for but
i must examine this other bill

as you please but i can't in conscience assist you
any more pray then excuse me

so while the old man with much painstakings resumed
his work the cosmopolitan to allow him every
facility resumed his reading at length seeing that he
had given up his undertaking as hopeless and was at
leisure again the cosmopolitan addressed some gravely
interesting remarks to him about the book before him
and presently becoming more and more grave said as
he turned the large volume slowly over on the table




and with much difficulty traced the faded remains of the
gilt inscription giving the name of the society who had
presented it to the boat ah sir though every one
must be pleased at the thought of the presence in public
places of such a book yet there is something that
abates the satisfaction look at this volume on the
outside battered as any old valise in the baggage-room
and inside white and virgin as the hearts of lilies in
bud

so it is so it is said the old man sadly his attention
for the first directed to the circumstance

nor is this the only time continued the other
that i have observed these public bibles in boats and
hotels all much like this   old without and new
within true this aptly typifies that internal freshness
the best mark of truth however ancient but then
it speaks not so well as could be wished for the good
book's esteem in the minds of the traveling public i
may err but it seems to me that if more confidence
was put in it by the traveling public it would hardly
be so

with an expression very unlike that with which he
had bent over the detector the old man sat meditating
upon his companion's remarks a while and at last with
a rapt look said and yet of all people the traveling
public most need to put trust in that guardianship which
is made known in this book

true true thoughtfully assented the other

and one would think they would want to and
be glad to continued the old man kindling for in




all our wanderings through this vale how pleasant not
less than obligatory to feel that we need start at no
wild alarms provide for no wild perils trusting in that
power which is alike able and willing to protect us
when we cannot ourselves

his manner produced something answering to it in
the cosmopolitan who leaning over towards him said
sadly though this is a theme on which travelers
seldom talk to each other yet to you sir i will say
that i share something of your sense of security i have
moved much about the world and still keep at it nevertheless
though in this land and especially in these
parts of it some stories are told about steamboats and
railroads fitted to make one a little apprehensive yet i
may say that neither by land nor by water am i ever
seriously disquieted however at times transiently uneasy
since with you sir i believe in a committee
of safety holding silent sessions over all in an invisible
patrol most alert when we soundest sleep and whose
beat lies as much through forests as towns along rivers
as streets in short i never forget that passage of
scripture which says jehovah shall be thy confidence
the traveler who has not this trust what miserable
misgivings must be his or what vain short-sighted
care must he take of himself

even so said the old man lowly

there is a chapter continued the other again
taking the book which as not amiss i must read you
but this lamp solar-lamp as it is begins to burn dimly

so it does so it does said the old man with




changed air dear me it must be very late i must to
bed to bed let me see rising and looking wistfully all
round first on the stools and settees and then on the
carpet let me see let me see   is there anything i
have forgot   forgot something i a sort of dimly remember
something my son   careful man   told me at
starting this morning this very morning something
about seeing to   something before i got into my berth
what could it be something for safety oh my poor
old memory

let me give a little guess sir life-preserver

so it was he told me not to omit seeing i had a
life-preserver in my state-room said the boat supplied
them too but where are they i don't see any
what are they like

they are something like this sir i believe lifting
a brown stool with a curved tin compartment underneath
yes this i think is a life-preserver sir and
a very good one i should say though i don't pretend to
know much about such things never using them myself

why indeed now who would have thought it
that a life-preserver that's the very stool i was sitting
on ain't it

it is and that shows that one's life is looked out
for when he ain't looking out for it himself in fact
any of these stools here will float you sir should the
boat hit a snag and go down in the dark but since
you want one in your room pray take this one handing
it to him i think i can recommend this one the




tin part rapping it with his knuckles seems so perfect   
sounds so very hollow

sure it's quite perfect though then anxiously
putting on his spectacles he scrutinized it pretty
closely   well soldered quite tight

i should say so sir though indeed as i said i
never use this sort of thing myself still i think that
in case of a wreck barring sharp-pointed timbers you
could have confidence in that stool for a special providence

then good-night good-night and providence have
both of us in its good keeping

be sure it will eying the old man with sympathy
as for the moment he stood money-belt in hand and
life-preserver under arm be sure it will sir since
in providence as in man you and i equally put trust
but bless me we are being left in the dark here pah
what a smell too

ah my way now cried the old man peering before
him where lies my way to my state-room

i have indifferent eyes and will show you but first
for the good of all lungs let me extinguish this lamp

the next moment the waning light expired and with
it the waning flames of the horned altar and the waning
halo round the robed man's brow while in the darkness
which ensued the cosmopolitan kindly led the old man
away something further may follow of this masquerade

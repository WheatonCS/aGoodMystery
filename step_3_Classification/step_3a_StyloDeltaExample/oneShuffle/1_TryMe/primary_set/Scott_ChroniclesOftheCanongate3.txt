the incidents a narrative this kind
must be adapted to each other as the wards 
a key must tally accurately with those the
lock to which it belongs the reader however
gentle will not hold himself obliged to rest satisfied
with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place which is generally
speaking all that in ordinary life he can know
 what is passing around him but lie is desirous
while reading for amusement knowing
the interior movements occasioning the course
 events this is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity for every man hath a right to open
and examine the mechanism his own watch
put together for his proper use although he is
not permitted to pry into the interior the timepiece
which for general information is displayed
on the townsteeple
it would be therefore uncourteous to leave
my readers under any doubt concerning the
agency which removed the assassin southron
from the gallows an event which some the
perth citizens ascribed to the foul fiend himself
while others were content to lay it upon
the natural dislike bonthron's countrymen
 fife to see him hanging on the river side
as a spectacle dishonourable to their province
about midnight after the day when the execution
had taken place when the inhabitants
 perth were deeply buried in slumber three
men mused in their cloaks and bearing a
dark lantern descended the alleys a garden
wtdcb led from the house occupied by sir john
ramorny to the banks the tay where a small
boat lay moored to a landingplace or little
projecting pier the wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs
and bushes and a pale moon leaded as it is
termed in scotland amongst drifted clouds
which seemed to threaten rain the three individuals
entered the boat with great precaution
to escape observation one them was
a tall powerful man another short and bent
downwards the third middlesized and apparently
younger than his companions and light
and active thus much the imperfect light
could discover they seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier
we must let her drift with the current till
we pass the bridge where the burghers still
keep guard and you know the proverb a
perth arrow hath a perfect flight said the
most youthful the party who assumed the
office helmsman and pushed the boat off
from the pier whilst the others took the oars
which were muffled and rowed with all precaution
till they attained the middle the
river they then ceased their efforts lay upon
their oars and trusted to the steersman for keeping
her in midchannel
in this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded
beneath the stately gothic arches 
the old bridge erected by the magnificent patronage
 robert bruce in and carried
away by an inundation in although they
heard the voices a civic watch which since
these disturbances commenced had been nightly
maintained in that important pass no challenge
was given and when they were so far
down the stream as to be out hearing 
those guardians the night they began to
row but still with precaution and to converse
though in a low tone
you have found a new trade comrade since
i left you said one the rowers to the
other i left you engaged in tending a sick
knight and i find you employed in purloining a
dead body from the gallows
 a living body so please your squirehood
master buncle or else my craft hath failed 
its purpose
so i am told master pottercarrier but
saving your clerkship unless you tell me your
trick i will take leave to doubt its success
a simple toy master buncle not likely to
please a genius so acute as that your variance
marry thus it is this suspension 
the human body which the vulgar call hanging
operates death by apoplexy that is the blood
being unable to return to the heart by the compression
 the veins it rushes to the brain
and the man dies also and as an additional
cause dissolution the lungs no longer receive
the needful supply the vital air owing
to the ligature the cord around the thorax 
and hence the patient perishes
i understand that well enough but how
is it to be prevented sir medicine said the
third person who was no other than ramorny's
page eliot
 marry then replied dwining hang me
the patient up in such fashion thai the carotid
arteries shall not be compressed and the
blood will not determine to the brain and apoplexy
will not take place and again if there
be no ligature around the thorax the lungs
will be supplied with air whether the man be
hanging in the middle heaven or standing on
the firm earth
 all this i conceive said eviot but how
these precautions can be reconciled with the
execution the sentence hanging is what
my dull brain cannot comprehend
ah good youth thy variance hath spoiled
a fair wit hadst thou studied with me
thou should'st have learned things more difficult
than these but here is my trick i get
me certain bandages made the same substance
with your young variance's horsegirths
having especial care that they are a kind
which will not shrink on being strained since
that would spoil my experiment one loop
 this substance is drawn under each foot and
returns up either side the leg to a cincture
with vvbich it is united these cincture are
connected by divers straps down the breast and
back in order to divide the weight and there
arc sundry other conveniences for easing the
patient but the chief is this the straps or
ligatures are attached to a broad steel collar
curving outwards and having a hook or two
for the better security the halter which the
friendly executioner passes around that part 
the machine instead applying it to the bare
throat the patient thus when thrown off
from the ladder the sufferer will find himself
suspended not by his neck if it please you but
by a steel circle which supports the loops in
which his feet are placed and on which his
weight really rests diminished a little by similar
supports under each arm thus neither
vein nor windpipe being compressed the man
will breathe as free and his blood saving from
fright and novelty situation will flow as
temperately as your variance's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field battle
 by my faith a quaint and rare device 
quoth bunch
is it not pursued the leech and well
worth being known to such mounting spirits as
your vacancies since there is no knowing to
what height sir john ramorny's pupils may
arrive and if these be such that it is necessary
to descend from them by a rope you may find
my mode management more convenient than
the common practice marry but you must be
provided with a highcollared doublet to conceal
the ring steel and above all such
a bonus socius as smother well to adjust the
noose
base poisonvender said eviot men 
our calling die on the field battle 
i will save the lesson however replied
buncle in case some pinching occasion
but what a night the hangdog bloody bonthrone
must have had it dancing a pavise in
mid air to the music his own shackles as the
night wind swings him that way and this 
it were an alms deed to leave him there
said eviot for his descent from the gibbet
will but encourage him to new murders he
knows but two elements drunkenness and
bloodshed
perhaps sir john ramorny might have
been your opinion said dwining but it
would first have been necessary to cut out the
rogue's tongue lest he had told strange tales
from his airy height and there are other
reasons that it concerns not your vacancies to
know in truth i myself have been generous
in serving him for the fellow is built as strong
as edinburgh castle and his anatomy would
have matched any that is in the chirurgical hall
 padua but tell me master buncle what
news bring you from the doughty douglas 
they may tell that know said buncle
i am the dull ass that bears the message and
kens nought its purport the safer for myself
perhaps i carried letters from the duke
 albany and from sir john ramorny to the
douglas and he looked black as a northern
tempest when he opened them i brought them
answers from the earl at which they smiled
like the sun when the harvest storm is closing
over lira go to your ephemerides leech and
conjure the meaning out that
me thinks i can do so without much cost
 wit said the chirurgeon hut yonder i
see in the pale moon our deadalive should
he have screamed out to any chance passenger
it were a curious interruption to a nightjourney
to be hailed from the top such a gallows
as that hark methinks i do hear his groans
amid the whistling the wind and the creaking
 the chains so fair and softly make
fast the boat with the grappling and get out
the casket with my matters we would be better
for a little fire but the light might bring observation
on us come on my men valour
march warily for we are bound for the gallows
foot follow with the lantern i trust the ladder
has been left
as they advanced to the gibbet they could
plainly hear groans though uttered in a low
tone d wining ventured to give a low cough
once or twice by way signal but receiving
no answer we had best make haste said he
to ills companions for our friend must be in
extremes as he gives no answer to the signal
which announces the arrival help come
let us to the gear i will go up the ladder
first and cut the rope do you two follow one
after another and take fast hold the body so
that he fall not when the halter is unloosed
keep sure gripe for which the bandages will afford
you convenience bethink you that though
he plays an owes part tonight he hath no wings
and to fall out a halter may be as dangerous
as to fall into one
while he spoke thus he ascended the ladder
and having ascertained that the menatarms
who followed him had the body in their hold
he cut the rope and then gave his aid to support
the almost lifeless form the criminal
by a skilful exertion strength and address
the body bonthron was placed safely on the
ground and the faint yet certain existence 
life having been ascertained it was thence transported
to the river side where shrouded by
the bank the party might be best concealed
from observation while the leech employed himself
in the necessary means recalling animation
with which he had taken care to provide
himself
for this purpose he first freed the recovered
person from his shackles which the executioner
had left unlocked on purpose and at the
same time disengaged the complicated envelopes
and bandages by which he had been suspended
it was some time ere dwining's efforts succeeded
 for in despite the skill with which his
machine had been constructed the straps designed
to support the body had stretched so
considerably as to occasion the sense suffocation
becoming extremely overpowering but
the address the surgeon triumphed over all
obstacles and after sneezing and stretching
himself with one or two brief convulsions bonthrone
gave decided proofs animation by
arresting the hand the operator as it was in
the act dropping strong waters on his breast
and throat and directing the bottle which contained
them to his lips he took almost perforce
a considerable gulp the contents
it is spiritual essence double distilled said
the astonished operator and would blister
the throat and burn the stomach any other
man but this extraordinary beast is so unlike
all other human creatures that i should
not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession his faculties
bonthron sat up stared around and indicated
some consciousness existence
wine wine were the first words which
he articulated
the leech gave him a draught medicated
wine mixed with water he rejected it under
the dishonourable epithet kennelwashings
and again uttered the words wine 
wine
nay take it to thee i the devil's name
said the leech since none but he can judge
 thy constitution
a draught long and deep enough to have
discomposed the intellects any other person
was found effectual in recalling those bonthrone
to a more perfect states though he betrayed
no recollection where he was or what
ig
iiaj befallen him and in this brief and sullen
manner asked why he was broglie to the riverside
at this time night
another frolic the wild prince for
drenching me as he did before nails and
blood but i would 
hold thy peace interrupted eviot and
be thankful i pray you if you have any thankfulness
in you that thy body is not crows meat
and thy soul in a place where water is too
scarce to duck thee
i begin to bethink me said the ruffian 
and raising the flask to his mouth which he saluted
with a long and hearty kiss he set the
empty bottle on the earth dropped his head on
his bosom and seemed to muse for the purpose
 arranging his confused recollections
 we can abide the issue his meditations
no longer said dwining he will be better
after he has slept up sir you have been
riding the air these some hours try if the water
be not an easier mode conveyance your
valours must lend me a hand i can no more
lift this mass than i could raise in my arms a
slaughtered bull
stand upright on thine own feet bonthrone
now we have placed thee upon them
said eviot
i cannot answered the patient every
drop blood tingles in my veins as if it had
pinpoints and my knees refuse to bear their
burden what can be the meaning all this 
this is some practice thine thou dog leech
ay ay so it is honest bonthron said
d wining a practice thou shalt thank me for
when thou comest to learn it in the meanwhile
stretch down in the stern that boat
and let me wrap this cloak about thee assisted
into the boat accordingly bonthron was
deposited there as conveniently as things admitted
 he answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt a
boar who has got some food particularly agreeable
to him
rand now buncle said the chirurgeon
 your valiant squireship knows your charge
vol hi b
ib
you are to carry this lively cargo by the river
to newburgli where you are to dispose him
as you wot meantime here are his shackles
and bandages the marks his confinement
and liberation bind them up together and
fling them into the deepest pool you pass over 
for found in your possession they might tell tales
against us all this low light breath wind
from the west will permit you to use a sail as
soon as the light comes in and you are tired
 rowing your other valiancy master page
eviot must be content to return to perth with
me afoot for here severs our fair company 
take with thee the lantern buncle for thou
wilt require it more than we and see thou send
me back my flasket
as the pedestrians returned to perth eviot
expressed his belief that bonthron's understanding
would never recover the shock which
terror had inflicted upon it and which appeared
to him to have disturbed all the faculties 
this mind and in particular his memory
it is not so an it please your pagehood
said the leech bonthrons intellect such as
it is hath a solid character it will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath
been put in motion and then will rest in its
proper point gravity our memory is all
our powers mind that which is peculiarly
liable to be suspended deep intoxication or
sound sleep alike destroy it and yet it returns
when the drunkard becomes sober or the sleeper
is awakened terror sometimes produces the
same effects i knew at paris a criminal condemned
to die by the halter who suffered the
sentence accordingly showing no particular
degree timidity upon the scaffold and behaving
and expressing himself as men in the
same condition are wont to do accident did
for him what a little ingenious practice hath
done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted he was cut down and given to his
friends before life was extinct and i had the
good fortune to recover him but though he
recovered in other particulars he remembered
but little his trial and sentence his confession
on the morning his execution he 
he he in his usual chuckling manner he
remembered him not a word neither leaving
the prison nor his passage to the grave
where he suffered nor the devout speeches
with which he he he edified he he he so
many good christians nor ascending the fatal
tree nor taking the fatal leap had my revenant
the slightest recollection but here we
reach the point where we must separate for it
were unfit should we meet any the watch
that we be found together and it were also
prudent that we enter the city by different
gates my profession forms an excuse for my
going and coming at all times your valiant
pagehood will make such explanation as may
seem sufficing
i shall make my will a sufficient excuse if i
am interrogated said the haughty young man
yet i will avoid interruption if possible the
moon is quite obscured and the road as black
as a wolds mouth
tut said the physician let not your
valour care for that we shall tread darker paths
ere it be long
without inquiring into the meaning these
evilboding sentences and indeed hardly listening
to them in the pride and recklessness his
nature the page ramorny parted from his
ingenious and dangerous companion and each
took his own way
i
chapter 
the come true love never did run smooth
the ominous anxiety our armourer had
not played bim false when the good glover
parted with his intended soninlaw after the
judicial combat had been decided he found what
he indeed had expected that his fair daughter
was in no favourable disposition to her lover but
although he perceived that catharine was cold
restrained collected had cast away the appearance
 mortal passion and listened with a reserve
implying contempt to the most splendid
description he could give her the combat in
the skinners yards he was determined not to
take the least notice her altered manner but
to speak her marriage with his son henry asa
thing which must course take place at
length when she began as on a former occasion
to intimate that her attachment to the armourer
did not exceed the bounds friendship that
she was resolved never to marry that the pretended
judicial combat was a mockery the
divine will and human laws the glover not
unnaturally grew angry
i cannot read thy thoughts wench nor
can i pretend to guess under what wicked delusion
it is that you kiss a declared lover suffer
him to kiss you run to his house when a report
is spread his death and fling yourself into
his arms when you find him alone all this
shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her
parents in a match sanctioned by her father 
but such tokens intimacy bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem and is
determined not to marry are untimely and unmaidenly
you have already been more bounteous
 your favours to henry smith than your
mother whom god assoilzie ever was to me
before i married her tell thee catharine
this trifling with the love an honest man is
what i neither can will nor ought to endure i
have given my consent to the match and i insist
it shall take place without delay and that
you receive henry wynd tomorrow as a man
whose bride you are to be with all dispatch
a power more potent than yours father
will say no replied catharine
i will risk it my power is a lawful one
that a father over a child and an erring
child answered her father god and man
allow my influence
then may heaven help us said catharine
 for if you are obstinate in your purpose
we are all lost
 we can expect no help from heaven said
the glover when we act with indiscretion
 am clerk enough myself to know that and
that your causeless resistance to my will is sinful
every priest will inform you ay and more
than that you have spoken degradingly the
blessed appeal to god in the combat ordeal
take heed for the holy church is awakened to
watch her sheepfold and to extirpate heresy by
fire and steel so much i warn thee 
catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation 
and with difficulty compelling herself to assume
an appearance composure promised her
father that if he would spare her any farther
discussion the subject till tomorrow morning
she would then meet him determined to
make a full discovery heirs sentiments
with this promise simon glover was obliged
to remain contented though extremely anxious
for the postponed explanation it could not be
levity or fickleness character which induced
his daughter to act with so much apparent inconsistency
towards the man his choice
and whom she had so lately unequivocally owned
to be also the man her own what external
force there could exist a kind powerful
enough to change the resolutions she had so
decidedly expressed within twentyfour hours
was a matter complete mystery
but i will be as obstinate as she can bethought
the glover and she shall either marry
henry smith without farther delay or old
simon glover will know an excellent reason to
the contrary
the subject was not renewed during the
evening but early on the next morning just
at surprising catharine knelt before the bed
in which her parent still slumbered her heart
sobbed as if it would burst and her tears fell
thick upon her father's face the good old man
awoke looked up crossed his child's forehead
and kissed her affectionately
i understand thee kate he said thou
art come to confession and i trust art deft

serous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere

catharine was silent for an instant
i need not ask my father if you remember
the carthusian monk clement and his
preaching and lessons at which indeed you
assisted so often that you cannot be ignorant
men called you one his converts and with
greater j justice termed me so likewise 
i am aware both said the old man
raising himself on his elbow but i defy foul
fame to show that i ever owned him in anv

heretical proposition though i loved to hear
him talk the corruptions the church the
misgovernment the nobles and the wild ignorance
 the poor proving as it seemed to me
that the sole virtue our commonweal its
strength and its estimation lay among the
burgher craft the better class which i received
as comfortable doctrine and creditable
to the town and if he preached other than
right doctrine wherefore did his superiors in
the carthusian convent permit it if the shepherds
turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the
flock they should not blame the sheep for being
worried
they endured his preaching nay they encouraged
it said catharine while the vices
 the laity the contentions the nobles and
the oppression the poor were the subject 
his censure and they rejoiced in the crowds
who attracted to the carthusian church forsook
those the other convents but the hypocrites
 for such they are joined with the
other fraternities in accusing their preacher clement
when passing from censuring the crimes
 the state he began to display the pride ignorance
and luxury the churchmen themselves 
their thirst power their usurpation overrun's
consciences and their desire to augment their
worldly wealth
for god's sake catharine said her father
 speak within doors your voice rises intone
and your speech in bitterness your eyes
sparkle it is owing to this zeal in what concerns
you no more than others that malicious
persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous
name a heretic
you know i speak no more than what is
truth said catharine and which you yourself
have avouched often
by needle and buckskin no answered
the glover hastily would'st thou have me
avouch what might cost me life and limb laud
and goods for a full commission hath been
granted for taking and trying heretics upon
whom is laid the cause all late tumults and
miscarriages wherefore few words are best
wench i am ever mind with the old maker

een perverted and yon
are in dittay as a gross railer against church and
churchmen and for holding discourse against
them with loose and profligate persons such as
the deceased oliver proudfute the smith
henry the wynd and others set forth as
commending the doctrines father clement
whom they charge with seven rank heresies and
seek for with staff and spear to try him to the
death but that said catharine kneeling and
looking upwards with the aspect one those
beauteous saints whom the catholics have given
to the fine arts that they shall never do
he hath escaped from the net the fowler 
and i thank heaven it was by my means
thy means girl art thou mad said the
amazed glover
i will not deny what i glory in answered
catharine it was by my means that concha
was led to come hither with a party men and
carry off the old man who is now far beyond
the highland line
o my rash my unlucky child said the
glover hast thou dared to aid the escape 
one accused heresy and to invite highlanders
in arms to interfere with the administration
 justice within burgh alas thou hast offended
both against the laws the church and
those the realm what what would become
 us were this known 
it is known my dear father said the maiden
firmly known even to those who will
be the most willing avengers the deed
this must be some idle notion catharine
or some trick those cogging priests and nuns 
it accords not with thy late cheerful willingness
to wed henry smith
alas dearest father remember the dismal
surprise occasioned by his reported death and
the joyful amazement at finding him alive and
deem it not wonder if i permitted myself under
your protection to say more than my reflection
justified but then i knew not the worst
and thought the danger exaggerated alas i
was yesterday fearfully undeceived when the
abbess herself came hither and with her the
dominican they showed me the commission
under the broad seal scotland for inquiring
into and punishing heresy they showed me
ig
your name and my own in a list suspected
persons and it was with tears real tears that
the abbess conjured me to avert a dreadful
fate by a speedy retreat into the cloister and
that the monk pledged his word that you should
not be molested if i complied
the foul fiend take them both for crocodiles
 said the glover
alas replied catharine complaint oranger
will little help us but you see i have had
real cause for this present alarm
alarm call it utter ruin alas my reckless
child where was your prudence when you
ran headlong into such a snare 
hear me father said catharine there
is still one mode safety held out it is one
which i have often proposed and for which i
have in vain supplicated your permission
i understand you the convent said her
father but catharine what abbess or prioress
would dare 
that i will explain to you father and it
will also show the circumstances which have
made me seem unsteady resolution to a demo

gree which has brought censure upon me from
yourself and others our confessor old father
francis whom i chose from the dominican convent
at your command 
ay truly interrupted the glover and i
so counselled and commanded thee in order to
take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction father clement
well this father francis has at different
times urged and provoked me to converse on
such matters as he judged i was likely to learn
something from the carthusian preacher
heaven forgive me my blindness i fell into the
snare spoke freely and as he argued gently as
one who would fain be convinced i even argued
warmly in defence what i believed devoutly
the confessor assumed not his real aspect and
betrayed not his secret purpose until he had
learned all that i had to tell him it was then
that he threatened me with temporal punishment
and with eternal condemnation had his
threats reached mc alone i could have stood
firm for their cruelty on earth i could have
vol iii c
s
endured and their power beyond this life i have
no belief in
for heaven's sake said the glover vrbo
was wellnigh beside himself at perceiving at
every new word the increasing extremity his
daughter's danger beware blaspheming the
holy church whose arms are as prompt to
strike as her ears are sharp to hear
to me said the maid perth again
looking up the terrors the threatened denunciations
would have been little avail 
but when they spoke involving thee my father
in the charge against me i own i trembled
and desired to compromise the abbess
martha elcho nunnery being my mother's
kinswoman i told her my distresses and
obtained her promise that she would receive me
if renouncing worldly love and thoughts wedlock
i would take the veil in her sisterhood
she had conversation on the topic i doubt not
with the dominican francis and both joined
in singing the same song remain in the
world said they and thy father and thou
shall be brought to trial as heretics assume the
veil and the errors both shall be forgiven and
cancelled they spoke not even recantation
 errors doctrine all should be peace if i
would but enter the convent
i doubt not i doubt not said simon 
the old glover is thought rich and his wealth
would follow his daughter to the convent 
elcho unless what the dominicans might claim
as their own share so this was thy call to the
veil these thy objections to henry wynd 
indeed father the course was urged on
all hands nor did my own mind recoil from it
sir john ramorny threatened me with the
powerful vengeance the young prince if i
continued to repel his wicked suit and as for
poor henry it is but late that i have discovered
to my own surprise that that i love
his virtues more than i dislike his faults alas 
the discovery has only been made to make my
quitting the world more difficult than when 
thought i had thee only to regret
she rested her head on her hand and wept
bitterly
 all this is folly said the glover never
was there an extremity so pinching but
what a wise man might find counsel if he was
daring enough to act upon it this has never
been the land or the people over whom priests
could rule in the name rome without their
usurpation being controlled if they are to punish
each honest burgher who says the monks
love gold and that the lives some them
cry shame upon the doctrines they teach why
truly stephen smothered will not lack employment
 and if all foolish maidens are to be
secluded from the world because they follow
the erring doctrines a popular preaching friar
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive
their inmates on slighter composition our
privileges have been often defended against the
pope himself by our good monarchs yore
and when he pretended to interfere with the
temporal government the kingdom there
wanted not a scottish parliament who told him
his duty in a letter that should have been written
in letters gold i have seen the epistle
myself and though i could not read it the very
sight the seals the right reverend prelates
and noble and true barons which hung at it
made my heart leap for joy thou should'st not
have kept this secret my child but it is no time
to tax thee with thy fault go down get me
some food i will mount instantly and go to our
lord provost and have his advice and as i
trust his protection and that other truehearted
scottish nobles who will not see a true
man trodden down for an idle word
 alas my father said catharine it was
even this impetuosity which i dreaded i knew
if i made my plaint to you there would soon be
fire and feud as if religion though sent to us by
the father peace were fit only to be the mother
 discord and hence i could now even
now give up the world and retire with my
sorrow among the sisters elcho would you
but let me be the sacrifice only father comfort
poor henry when we are parted for ever 
and do not do not let him think me too
harshly say catharine will never vex him
more by her remonstrances but that she will
never forget him in her prayers
 the girl bath a tongue that would make a
saracen weep said her father his own eyes
sympathizing with those his daughter but
i will not yield way to this combination between
the nun and the priest to rob me 
my only child away with you girl and let
me don my clothes and prepare yourself to
obey me in what i may have to recommend for
your safety get a few clothes together and
what valuables thou hast also take the keys
 my iron box which poor henry smith gave
me and divide what gold you find into two portions
 put the one into a purse for thyself and
the other into the quilted girdle which i made
on purpose to wear on journeys thus both shall
be provided in case fate should sunder us in
which event god send the whirlwind may take
the withered leaf and spare the green one let
them make ready my horse instantly and the
white jennet that i bought for thee but a day since
hoping to see thee ride to st john's kirk with
maids and matrons as blithe a bride as ever
crossed the holy threshold but it skills not talking
 away and remember that the saints help
those who are willing to help themselves not
word in answer begone i say no wilfulness
now the pilot in calm weather will let a
seaboy trifle with the rudder but by my soul
when winds howl and waves arise he stands
by the helm himself away no reply
catharine left the room to execute as well
as she might the commands her father who
gentle in disposition and devotedly attached
to his child suffered her often as it seemed to
guide and rule both herself and him yet who
as she knew was wont to claim filial obedience
and exercise parental authority with sufficient
strictness when the occasion seemed to require
an enforcement domestic discipline
while the fair catharine was engaged in
executing her father's behests and the good
old glover was hastily attiring himself as one
who was about to take a journey a horse's
tramp was heard in the narrow street the
horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak having
the cape it drawn up as if to hide the
under part his face while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows and a broad plume ohscared
bis upper features he sprung from the
saddle and dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom
ere the stranger had ascended the stair and entered
the sleeping apartment simon astonished
and alarmed and disposed to see in this
early visitant an apparitor or sumner come to
attach him and his daughter was much relieved
when as the stranger doffed the bonnet
and threw the skirt the mantle from his face
he recognised the knightly provost the fair
city a visit from whom at any time was a favour
 no ordinary degree but being made at
such an hour had something marvellous and
connected with the circumstances the times
even alarming
sir patrick charteris said the glover
 this high honour done to your poor beadsman
 
hush said the knight there is no time
for idle civilities i came hither because a
man is in trying occasions his own safest page
and i can remain no longer than to bid thee
fly good glover since warrants are to be
granted this day in council for the arrest thy
daughter and thee under charge heresy
and delay will cost you both your liberty for
certain and perhaps your lives
i have heard something such a matter
said the glover and was this instant setting
forth to kinfauns to plead my innocence 
this scandalous charge to ask your lordship's
counsel and to implore your protection
thy innocence friend simon will avail
thee but little before prejudiced judges my
advice is in one word to fly and wait for happier
times as for my protection we must tarry till
the tide turns ere it will in any sort avail thee
but if thou canst lie concealed for a few days
or weeks i have little doubt that the churchmen
who by siding with the duke albany
in court intrigue and by alleging the decay 
the purity catholic doctrine as the sole cause
 the present national misfortunes have at least
for the present hour an irresistible authority
over the king wil receive a check in the meanwhile
however know that king robert hath
not only given way to this general warrant for
inquisition after heresy but hath confirmed
the pope's nomination robert wardle to
be archbishop st andrews and primate 
scotland thus yielding to rome those freedoms
and immunities the scottish church which
his ancestors from the time malcolm canmore
have so boldly defended his brave fathers
would have rather subscribed a covenant
with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions rome
alas and what remedy 
none old man save in some sudden court
change said sir patrick the king is but like
a mirror which having no light itself reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed
near to it for the time now although the douglas
is banded with albany yet the earl is unfavourable
to the high claims those domineering
priests having quarrelled with them about the
exactions which his retinue hath raised on the
abbot arbroath he will come back again
with a high hand for report says the earl 
march hath fled before him when he returns
we shall have a changed world for his presence
will control albany especially as many nobles
and i myself as i tell you in confidence are
resolved to league with him to defend the general
right thy exile therefore will with his
return to our court thou hast but to seek thee
some temporary hiding place
for that my lord said the glover i
can be at no loss since i have just title to the
protection the high highland chief gilchrist
maclan chief the clan quhele
nay if thou canst take hold his mantle
thou needs no help any one else neither lowland
churchman nor layman finds a free course
 justice beyond the highland frontier
but then my child noble sir my catharine
 said the glover
let her go with thee man the grattan
cake will keep her white teeth in order the
goat's whey will make the blood spring to her
cheek again which these alarms have banished 
and even the fair maiden perth may sleep
soft enough on a bed highland grecian
it is not from such idle respects my lord
that i hesitate said the glover catharine
is the daughter a plain burgher and knows
not nicety food or lodging but the son 
maclan hath been for many years a guest in
my house and i am obliged to say that i have
observed him looking at my daughter who is
as good as a betrothed bride in a manner that
though i cared not for it in this lodging in curfew
street would give me some fear consequences
in a highland glen where i have no
friend and conachar many
the knightly provost replied by along whistle
 whew whew nay in that case i advise
thee to send her to the nunnery at elcho where
the abbess if i forget not is some relation 
yours indeed she said so herself adding that
she loved her kinswoman well together with all
that belongs to thee simon
truly my lord i do believe that the abbess
hath so much regard for me that she would
willingly receive the trust my daughter and
my whole goods and gear into her sisterhood 
marry her affection is something a tenacious
character and would be loath to unloose its
hold either upon the wench or her tocher

whew whew again whistled the knightly
provost by the thane's cross man
but this is an illfavoured pirn to wind yet
it shall never be said the fairest maid in the
fair city was cooped up in a convent like a
kainhen in a cave and she about to be married
to the bold burgess henry wynd that
tale shall not be told while i wear belt and
spurs and am called provost perth
but what remedy my lord asked the
glover
we must all take our share the risk
come get you and your daughter presently to
horse you shall ride with me and we'll see
who dare gloom at you the summons is not
yet served on thee and if they send an apparitor
to kinfauns without a warrant under the king's
own hand i make mine avow by the red rover's
soul that he shall eat his writ both
wax and wetherskin to horse to horse and
addressing catharine as she entered at the moment
 you too my pretty maid
to horse and fear not for your quarters 
they thrive in law that trust in charters
in a minute or two the father and daughter
were on horseback both keeping an arrow's
flight before the provost by his direction that
they might not seem to be the same company
they passed the eastern gate in some haste
and rode forward roundly until they were out
 sight sir patrick followed leisurely but
when he was lost to the view the warders
he sparred his mettled horse and soon came
up with the glover and catharine when a conversation
ensued which throws light upon some
previous passages this history
chapter iii
i have been devising a mode said the
wellmeaning provost by which i may make
you both secure for a week or two from the
malice your enemies when i have little doubt
i may see a changed world at court but that
i may the better judge what is to be done tell
me frankly simon the nature your connexion
with gilchrist maclan which leads you to
repose such implicit confidence in him you
are a close observer the rules the city and
are aware the severe penalties which they denounce
against such burghers as have covenant
alliance with the highland clans
true my lord but it is also known to
you that our craft working in skins cattle
stags and every other description hides have
a privilege and are allowed to transact with those
highlanders as with the men who can most
readily supply us with the means conducting
our trade to the great profit the burgh
thus it hath chanced me to have great dealings
with these men and i can take it on my
salvation that you nowhere find more just and
honourable trafficked or by whom a man may
more easily make an honest penny i have made
in my day several distant journeys into the far
highlands upon the faith their chiefs nor
did i ever meet with a people more true to their
word when you can once prevail upon them to
plight it in your behalf and as for the highland
chief gilchrist maclan saving that he is hasty
in homicide and fireraising towards those with
whom he hath deadly feud i have nowhere seen
a man who walketh a more just and upright
path
it is more than ever i heard before said
sir patrick charteris yet i have known
something the highland run agates too
they sliovv another favour and a very different
one to their friends than to their enemies
as your lordship shall understand said the
glover however be that as it may it chanced
me to serve gilchrist maclan in a high
matter it is now about eighteen years since
that it chanced the clan quhele and clan
chattan being at feud as indeed they are seldom
at peace the former sustained such a defeat
as wellnigh extirpated the family their
chief maclan seven his sons were slain in
battle and after it himself put to flight and his
castle taken and given to the flames his wife
then near the time giving birth to an infant
fled into the forest attended by one faithful servant
and his daughter here in sorrow and care
enough she gave birth to a boy and as the misery
 the mother's condition rendered her little
able to suckle the infant he was nursed with the
milk a doe which the forester who attended
her contrived to take alive in a snare it
was not many months afterwards that in a second
encounter these fierce clans maclan
defeated his enemies in his turn and regained
vol iii d
possession the district which he had lost it
was with unexpected rapture that he found his
wife and child were in existence having never
expected to see more them than the bleached
bones from which the wolves and wildcats had
eaten the flesh
but a strong and prevailing prejudice such
as is often entertained by these wild people
prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained
his only son in safety an ancient prophecy
was current among them that the power 
the tribe should fall by means a boy born under
a bush holly and suckled by a white doe
the circumstance unfortunately for the chief
tallied exactly with the birth the only child
which remained to him and it was demanded
 him by the elders the clan that the boy
should be either put to death or at least removed
from the dominions the tribe and brought
up in obscurity gilchrist mac ian was obliged to
consent and having made choice the latter
proposal the child under the name conachar
was brought up in my family with the purpose
as was at first intended concealing from him
all knowledge who or what he was or his
pretensions to authority over a numerous and
warlike people but as years rolled on the elders
 the tribe who had exerted so much authority
were removed by death ter rendered incapable
 interfering in the public affairs by age 
while on the other hand the influence gilchrist
maclan was increased by his successful
struggles against the clan chattan in which he
restored the equality betwixt the two contending
confederacies which had existed before the
calamitous defeat which i told your honour
feeling himself thus firmly seated he naturally
became desirous to bring home his only son
to his bosom and family and for that purpose
caused me to send the young conachar
as he was called more than once to the highlands
he was a youth expressly made by his
form and gallantry bearing to gain a father's
heart at length i suppose the lad either
guessed the secret his birth or something
 it was communicated to him and the disgust
which the haughty hieland varlet had always
shown for my honest trade became more 

fest so that i dared not so much as lay my
staff over bis costard for fear receiving a
stab with a dirk as an answer in gaelic to a
saxon remark it was then i wished to be well
rid him the rather that he showed so much
devotion to catharine who forsooth set herself
up to wash the ethiopian and teach a
wild husbandman mercy and morals she knows
herself how it ended
nay my father said catharine it was
surely but a point charity to snatch the brand
from the burning
but a small point wisdom said her father
 to risk the burning your own fingers
for such an what says my lord to the
matter 
my lord would not offend the fair maid 
perth said sir patrick and he knows well
the purity and truth her mind and yet i must
needs say that had this nursling the doe
been shrivelled haggard crossmade and repaired
like some highlanders i have known i
question if the fair maiden perth would
have bestowed so much zeal upon his converts

sioii and if catharine had been as aged wrinkled
and bent by years as the old woman that
opened the door to me this morning i would
wager my gold spurs against a pair highland
brogues that this wild roebuck would
never have listened to a second lecture you
laugh glover and catharine blushes a blush
 anger let it pass it is the way the
world
the way in which the men the world
esteem their neighbours my lord answered
catharine with some spirit
nay fair saint forgive a jest said the
knight and thou simon tell us how this
tale ended with conachar's escape to the
highlands i suppose 
 with his return thither said the glover
there was for some two or three years a fellow
about perth a sort messenger who came
and went under divers pretences but was in
fact the means communication between gilchrist
maclan and his son young conachar
or as he is now called hector from this gillie
i learned in general that the banishment
 the dault an neigh deil or foster child 
the white doe was again brought under consideration
 the tribe his foster father torquit
 the oak the old forester appeared with
eight sons the finest men the clan and demanded
that the doom banishment should be
revoked he spoke with the greater authority
as he was himself taishatar or a seer and
supposed to have communication with the invisible
world he affirmed that he had performed
a magical ceremony termed tinegan
by which he evoked a fiend from whom he extorted
a confession that conachar now called
eachin or hector maclan was the only man
in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without
blood or blemish hence torquil the oak
argued that the presence the fated person
was necessary to insure the victory so much
i am possessed this said the forester that
unless eachin fight in his place in the ranks 
the clan quhele neither i his fosterfather
nor any my eight sons will lift a weapon in
the quarrel
this speech was received with much alarm
for the defection nine men the stoutest their
tribe would be a serious blow more especially
if the combat as begins to be rumoured should be
decided by a small number from each side the
ancient superstition concerning the foster son 
the white doe was counterbalanced by a new
and later prejudice and the father took the opportunity
 presenting to the clan his longhidden
son whose youthful but handsome and
animated countenance haughty carriage and
active limbs excited the admiration the clansmen
who joyfully received him as the heir and
descendant their chief notwithstanding the
ominous presage attending his birth and nurture

from this tale my lord continued simon
glover your lordship may easily conceive
why i myself should be secure a good reception
among the clan quhele i and you may also
have reason to judge that it would be very rash
in me to carry catharine thither and this
noble lord is the heaviest my troubles
we shall lighten the load then said sir
patrick aod good glover i will take risk
for thee and this damsel my alliance with the
douglas gives me some interest with marjory
duchess rothsay his daughter the neglected
wife our wilful prince rely on it good
glover that in her retinue thy daughter will
be as secure as in a fenced castle the duchess
keeps house now at falkland a castle which
the duke albany to whom it belongs has
lent to her for her accommodation i cannot
promise you pleasure fair maiden for the
duchess marjory rothsay is unfortunate
and therefore splenetic haughty and overbearing
 conscious the want attractive qualities
therefore jealous those women who possess
them but she is firm in faith and noble
in spirit and would fling pope or prelate into
the ditch her castle who should come to arrest
any one under her protection you will
therefore have absolute safety though you may
lack comfort
i have no title to more said catharine and
deeply do i feel the kindness that is willing to
secure me such honourable protection if she
be haughty i will remember she is a douglas
and hath right to entertain as much pride as may
become a mortal if she be fretful i will recollect
that she is unfortunate and if she be unreasonably
captious i will not forget that she is
my protectress heed no longer for me my lord
when you have placed me under the noble lady's
charge but my poor father to be exposed
amongst these wild and dangerous people 
vhich was
regarded by the clan as a species palladium
only produced and used on the most solemn occasions
such as the present
the booshalloch somewhat discontented
muttered to simon as he took his place these
are changed days friend his father rest his
soul would have spoken to us both but these
are bad manners which he has learned among
you sassenachs in the low country
to this remark the glover did not think it
necessary to reply instead which he adverted
to the evergreens and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior 
the bower was decorated the most remarkable
part these ornaments was a number highland
shirts mail with steel bonnets battleaxes
and twohanded swords to match which
hung around the upper part the room together
with targets highly and richly embossed
each mail shirt was hung over a welldressed
stag's hide which at once displayed the armour
to advantage and saved it from suffering by
damp
these whispered the booshalloch are
the arms the chosen champions the clan
quhele they are twentynine in number as
you see eachin himself being the thirtieth who
wears his armour today else had there been
thirty and he has not got such a good hauberk
after all as he should wear on palm sunday
these nine suits harness such large
size are for the leichtach from whom so much
is expected
 and these goodly deerhides said simon
the spirit his profession awakening at the
sight the goods in which he traded think
you the chief will be disposed to chaffer for
them they are in demand for the doublets
which knights wear under their armour
did i not pray you said niel booshalloch
to say nothing on that subject
it is the mail shirts i speak said simon
 may i ask if any them were made
by our celebrated perth armourer called henry
 the wynd 
thou art more unlucky than before said
niel that man's name is to eachin's temper
like a whirlwind upon the lake yet no man
knows for what cause
i can guess thought our glover but gave
no utterance to the thought and having twice
lighted on unpleasant subjects conversation
he prepared to apply himself like those around
him to his food without starling another topic
we have said as much the preparations as
may lead the reader to conclude that the festival
in respect the quality the food was 
the most rude description consisting chiefly 
huge joints meat which were consumed with
little respect to the fasting season although
several the friars the island convent graced
and hallowed the board by their presence the
platters were wood and so were the hooped
rogues or cups out which the guests
quaffed their liquor as also the broth or juice
 the meat which was held a delicacy there
were also various preparations milk which
were highly esteemed and were eaten out 
similar vessels bread was the scarcest article
at the banquet but the glover and his patron
niel were served with two small loaves expressly
for their own use in eating as indeed was
then the case all over britain the guests used
their knives called scenes or the large poniards
named dirks without troubling themselves by
the reflection that they might occasionally have
served different or more fatal purposes
at the upper the table stood a vacant
seat elevated a step or two above the floor it
was covered with a canopy holly boughs and
ivy and there rested against it a sheathed sword
and a folded banner this had been the seat 
the deceased chieftain and was left vacant in
honour him eachin occupied a lower chair
on the right hand the place honour
the reader would be greatly mistaken who
should follow out this description by supposing
that the guests behaved like a herd hungry
wolves rushing upon a feast rarely offered to
them on the contrary the clan quhele conducted
themselves with that species courteous
reserve and attention to the wants others
which is often found in primitive nations especially
such as are always in arms because a
general observance the rules courtesy is
necessary to prevent quarrels bloodshed and
death the guests took the places assigned
them by torquil the oak who acting as
marischal taeh i e sewer the mess touched
with a white wand without speaking a
word the place where each was to sit thus
placed in order the company patiently waited
for the portion assigned them which was distributed
among them by the leichtach the bravest
men or more distinguished warriors the
tribe being accommodated with a double mess
emphatically called hieyfir or the portion 
a man when the sewers themselves had seen
every one served they resumed their places
at the festival and were each served with one
 these larger messes food water was placed
within each man's reach and a handful
 soft moss served the purposes a tablenapkin
so that as at an eastern banquet the hands
were washed as often as the mess was changed
for amusement the bard recited the praises
 the deceased chief and expressed the clan's
confidence in the blossoming virtues his
successor the seanachie recited the genealogy
 the tribe which they traced to the race
the dalriads the harpers played within while
the warpipes cheered the multitude without
the conversation among the guests was grave
subdued and civil no jest was attempted beyond
the bounds a very gentle pleasantry
calculated only to excite a passing smile there
were no raised voices no contentious arguments
and simon glover had heard a hundred times
more noise at a guildfeast than was made on
this occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers

even the liquor itself did not seem to raise
the festive party above the same tone decorous
gravity it was various kinds wine
appeared in very small quantities and was served
out only to the principal guests among
which honoured number simon glover was
again included the wine and the two wheaten
loaves were indeed the only marks notice
which he received during the feast but niel
booshalloch jealous his master's reputation
for hospitality failed not to enlarge on them as
proofs high distinction distilled liquors
since so generally used in the highlands were
then comparatively unknown the usquebaugh
ill
was circulated in small quantities and was
highly flavoured with a decoction saffron and
other hers so as to resemble a medicinal potion
rather than a festive cordial cider and
mead were seen at the entertainment but ale
brewed in great quantities for the purpose and
flowing round without restriction was the liquor
generally used and that was drunk with a
moderation much less known among the more
modern highlanders a cup to the memory 
the deceased chieftain was the first pledge solemnly
proclaimed after the banquet was finished
 and a low murmur benedictions was
heard from the company while the monks
alone uplifting their united voices sung requiem
eternal dona an unusual silence followed
as if something extraordinary was expected
when eachin arose with a bold and manly yet
modest grace and ascended the vacant seat or
throne saying with dignity and firmness 
this seat and my father's inheritance i
claim as my right so prosper me god and st
barr 
how will you rule your father's children 
said an old man the uncle the deceased
i will defend them with my father's sword
and distribute justice to them under my father's
banner
the old man with a trembling hand unsheathed
the ponderous weapon and holding
it by the blade offered the hilt to the young
chieftain's grasp at the same time torquil 
the oak unfurled the pennon the tribe and
swung it repeatedly over eachin's head who
with singular grace and dexterity brandished
the huge claymore as in its defence the guests
raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance
 the patriarchal chief who claimed their
allegiance nor was there any who in the graceful
and agile youth before them was disposed
to recollect the subject sinister vaticinations
as he stood in glittering mail resting on the
long sword and acknowledging by gracious
gestures the acclamations which rent the air
within without and around simon glover
was tempted to doubt whether this majestic
figure was that the same lad whom he had
often treated with little ceremony and began
to have some apprehension the consequences
 having done so a general burst minstrelsy
succeeded to the acclamations and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes as lately to
shout and yell woe
it would be tedious to pursue the progress 
the inaugural feast or detail the pledges that
were quaffed to former heroes the clan and
above all to the twentynine brave gallowglas
ses who were to fight in the approaching conflict
under the eye and leading their young
chief the bards assuming in old times the
prophetic character combined with their own
ventured to assure them the most distinguished
victory and to predict the fury with
which the blue falcon the emblem the clan
quhele should rend to pieces the mountaincat
the wellknown badge the clan chattan
it was approaching sunset when a bowl called
the gracecup made oak hooped with
silver was handed round the table as the signal
 dispersion although it was left free to
any who chose a longer carouse to retreat to
vol iii h
any the outer bothies as for simon glover
the booshalloch conducted him to a small hut
contrived it would seem for the use a single
individual where a bed heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit
and an ample supply such delicacies as the
late feast afforded showed that all care had
been taken for the inhabitant's accommodation

do not leave this hut said the booshal
loch taking leave his friend and protege
this is your place rest but apartments are
lost on such a night confusion and if the badger
leaves his hole the tod will creep into it
to simon glover this arrangement was by
no means disagreeable he had been wearied
by the noise the day and felt desirous repose
after eating therefore a morsel which
his appetite scarce required and drinking a cup
 wine to expel the cold he muttered his
evening prayer wrapt himself in his cloak and
lay down on a couch which old acquaintance
toil scoitice for fox
had made familiar and easy to him the hum
and murmur and even the occasional shouts 
some the festive multitude who continued
revelling without did not long interrupt his repose
 and in about ten minutes he was as fast
asleep as if he had lain in his own bed in curfew
street
chapter 
colonies still harping on my daughter
hamlet
two hours before the blackcock crew simon
glover was wakened by a wellknown
voice which called him by name
what conachar he replied as he started
from sleep is the morning so far advanced
and raising his eyes the person whom
he was dreaming stood before him and at the
same moment the events yesterday rushing
on his recollection he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned
it and it was not the mailclad highland chief
with claymore in hand as he had seen him the
preceding night but conachar curfew street
in his humble apprentice's garb holding in his
hand a switch oak an apparition would not
more have surprised our perth burgher ashe
gazed with wonder the youth turned upon
him a piece lighted bogwood which he carried
in a lantern and to his waking exclamation
replied 
essen so father simon it is conachar
come to renew our old acquaintance when our
intercourse will attract least notice
so saying he sat down on a tressel which
answered the purpose a chair and placing
the lantern beside him proceeded in the most
friendly tone
i have tasted thy good cheer many a
day father simon i trust thou hast found no
lack in my family 
none whatever eacbin maclan answered
the glover for the simplicity the celtic
language and manners rejects all honorary
titles it was even too good for this fasting
season and much too good for me since i must
be ashamed to think how hard you fared in
curfew street
even too good to use your own word
said conachar for the deserts an idle apprentice
and for the wants a young highlander
but yesterday if there was as i trust
enough food found you not good glover
some lack courteous welcome excuse it not
i know you did so but i am young in authority
with my people and i must not too early
draw their attention to the period my residence
in the lowlands which however i can
never forget
i understand the cause entirely said simon
 and therefore it is unwillingly and as
it were by force that i have made so early
a visit hither
hush father hush it is well you are
come to see some my highland splendour
while it yet sparkles return after palm sunday
and who knows whom or what you may
find in the territories we now possess the
wildcat may have made his lodge where the
banquetting bower mac ian now stands
the young chief was silent and pressed the
top the rod to his lips as if to guard against
uttering more
there is no fear that eachin said simon
in that vague way in which lukewarm
comforters endeavour to turn the reflection 
their friends from the consideration inevitable
danger
there is fear and there is peril utter
ruin answered eachin and there is positive
certainty great loss i marvel my father
consented to this wily proposal albany i
would mac gillie chattachan would take with
me and then instead wasting our best blood
against each other we would go down together
to stratford and kill and take possession i
would rule at perth and he at dundee and all
the great strath should be our own to the
banks the faith tay such is the policy
i have caught from your old grey head father
simon when holding a trencher at thy back
and listening to thy evening talk with bailie
craigdallie
the tongue is well called an unruly member
thought the glover here have i been
holding a candle to the devil to show him the
way to mischief
but he only said aloud these plans come
too late
too late indeed answered eachin the
indentures battle are signed by our marks
and seals the burning hate the clan quhele
and clan chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable
flame by mutual insults and boasts
yes the time is passed by but to thine own
affairs father glover it is religion that has
brought thee hither as i learn from niel booshallow
surely my experience thy prudence
did not lead me to suspect thee any quarrel
with mother church as for my old acquaintance
father clement he is one those who
hunt after the crown martyrdom and think
a stake surrounded with blazing faggots better
worth embracing than a willing bride he is a
very knighterrant in defence his religious
notions and does battle wherever he comes he
hath already a quarrel with the monks sibyl's
isle yonder about some point doctrine
hast seen him 
i have answered simon but we spoke
little together the time being pressing
 he may have said that there is a third person
 one more likely i think to be a true fugitive
for religion than either you a shrewd citizen
or he a wrangling preacher who would
be right heartily welcome to share our protection
 thou art dull man and wilt not guess
my meaning thy daughter catharine 
these last words the young chief spoke in
english and he continued the conversation in
that language as if apprehensive being overheard
 and indeed as if under the sense some
involuntary hesitation
my daughter catharine said the glover
remembering what the carthusian had told him
is well and safe
but where or with whom said the young
chief and wherefore came she not with
you think you the clan quhele have no
callimachus as active as old dorothy whose hand
has warmed my habits before now to wait upon
the daughter their chieftains master 
again i thank you said the glover and
doubt neither your power nor your will to protect
my daughter as well as myself but an
honourable lady the friend sir patrick charters
hath offered her a safe place refuge
without the risk a toilsome journey through
a desolate and distracted country
oh ay sir patrick charteris said eachin
in a more reserved and distant tone he
must be preferred to all men without doubt he
is your friend i think 
simon glover longed to punish this affectation
 a boy who had been scolded four times
aday for running into the street to see sir patrick
charteris ride past but he checked his
spirit repartee and simply said 
 sir patrick charteris has been provost 
perth for seven years and it is likely is so
still since the magistrates are elected not in
lent but at st martinmas
ah father glover said the youth in his
kinder and more familiar mode address
 you are so used to see the sumptuous shows
and pageants perth that you would but little
relish our barbarous festival in comparison
what didst thou think our ceremonial yesterday

it was noble and touching said the glover
 and to me who knew your father most
especially so when you rested on the sword
and looked around you methought i saw mine
old friend gilchrist mac ian arisen from the
dead and renewed in years and in strength
i played my part there boldly i trust and
showed little that paltry apprentice boy
whom you used to use just as he deserved
eachin resembles conachar said the glover
 no more than a salmon resembles a par
though men say they are the same fish in a
different state or than a butterfly resembles
a grub
thickest thou that while i was taking upon
me the power which all women love i would
have been myself an object for a maiden's eye
to rest upon to speak plain what would catharine
have thought me in the ceremonial 
we approach the shallows now thought simon
glover and without nice pilotage we
drive right on shore
most women like show eachin but i
think my daughter catharine be an exception
she would rejoice in the good fortune her
household friend and playmate but she would
not value the splendid maclan captain clan
quhele more than the orphan conachar
she is ever generous and disinterested
replied the young chief but yourself father
have seen the world for many more years
than she has done and can better form a judgment
what power and wealth do for those who
enjoy them think and speak sincerely what
would be your own thoughts if you saw your
catharine standing under yonder canopy with
the command over an hundred hills and the
devoted obedience ten thousand vassals and
as the price these advantages her hand in
that the man who loves her the best in the
world
meaning in your own conachar said
simon
ay conachar call me i love the name
since it was by that i have been known to catharine

sincerely then said the glover endeavouring
to give the least offensive turn to his
reply my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that catharine and i were safe in
our humble booth in curfew street with dorothy
for our only vassal
and with poor conachar also i trust 
you would not leave him to pine away in solitary
grandeur 
i would not answered the glover wish
so ill to the clan quhele mine ancient friends
as to deprive them at a moment emergency
 a brave young chief and that chief the
fame which he is about to acquire at their head
in the approaching conflict
eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated
feelings as he replied words words 
empty words father simon you fear the
clan quhele more than you love them and
you suppose their indignation would be formidable
should their chief marry the daughter
 a burgess perth
and if i do fear such an issue hector
maclan have i not reason how have illassorted
marriages had issue in the house macaw
in that the powerful maclean nay
 the lords the isles themselves what
has ever come them but divorce and exhortation
 sometimes worse fate to the ambitious
intruder you could not marry my child
before a priest and you could only wed her with
your left hand and i he checked the strain
 impetuosity which the subject inspired and
concluded and i am an honest though
humble burgher perth who would rather
my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse
 a citizen in my own rank than the licensed
concubine a monarch
i will wed catharine before the priest and
before the world before the altar and before
the black stones long said the impetuous
young man she is the love my youth and
there is not a tie in religion or honour but i
will bind myself by them i have sounded my
people if we do but win this combatant with
the hope gaining catharine we shall win it
my heart tells me so i shall be so much lord
over their affections that were i to take a bride
from the almshouse so it was my pleasure
they would hail her as if she were a daughter
 maccallanmore but you reject my suit 
said eachin sternly
you put words offence in my mouth
said the old man and may next punish me
for them since i am wholly in your power but
with my consent my daughter shall never wed
save in her own degree her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes 
bloodshed which connect themselves with your
lot if you really love her and recollect her
dread strife and combat you would not wish
her to be subjected to the train military horrors
in which you like your father must needs
be inevitably and eternally engaged choose a
bride amongst the daughters the mountain
chiefs my son or fiery lowland nobles you
are fair young rich highborn and powerful
and will not woo in vain you will readily find
one who will rejoice in your conquests and
cheer you under defeat to catharine the one
would be as frightful as the other a warrior
must wear a steel gauntlet a glove kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour
a dark cloud passed over the face the
young chief lately animated with so much
fire
farewell he said the only hope which
could have lighted me to fame or victory 
he remained for a space silent and intensely
thoughtful with downcast eyes a lowering
brow and folded arms at length he raised
his hands and said father for such you
have been to me i am about to tell you a secret
reason and pride both advise me to be
silent but fate urges me and must be obeyed
i am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man
but beware this conference how it will
beware how you ever breathe a syllable 
what i am now to trust to you for know
that were you to do so in the most remote corner
 scotland i have ears to hear it even
there and a hand and poniard to reach a traitor's
bosom i am but the word will not out 
do not speak it then said the prudent
glover a secret is no longer safe when it
crosses the lips him who owiis it and i desire
not a confidence so dangerous as you menace
me with
ay but i must speak and you must hear
said the youth in this age battle father
you have yourself been a combatant 
once only replied simon when the
southron assaulted the fair city i was summoned
to take my part in the defence as my
tenure required like that other craftsmen
who are bound to keep watch and ward
and how felt you upon that matter inquired
the young chief
what can that import to the present business
 said simon in some surprise
much else had i not asked the question
answered eachin in the tone haughtiness
which from time to time he assumed
 an old man is easily brought to speak 
olden times said simon not unwilling on an
vol iii i
instant's reflection to lead the conversation
away from the subject his daughter and
i must needs confess my feelings were much
short the high cheerful confidence nay the
pleasure with which i have seen other men goto
battle my life and profession were peaceful
and though i have not wanted the spirit 
a man when the time demanded it yet i have
seldom slept worse than the night before that
onslaught my ideas were harrowed by the
tales we were told nothing short the truth
about the saxon archers how they drew shafts
 a clothyard length and used bows a third
longer than ours when i fell into a broken
slumber if but a straw in the mattress pricked
my side i started and waked thinking an
english arrow was quivering in my body in
the morning as i began for very weariness to
sink into some repose i was waked by the tolling
 the common bell which called us burghers
to the walls i never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since
go on what further chanced demanded
eachin
i did on my harness said simon such as
it was took my mothers blessing a highspirited
woman who spoke my father's actions
for the honour the fair town this heartened
me and i felt still bolder tvhen i found myself
ranked among the other crafts all bowmen
for thou knowest the perth citizens have good
skill in archery we were dispersed on the walls
several knights and squires in armour proof
being mingled amongst us who kept a bold
countenance confident perhaps in their harness
and informed us for our encouragement that
they would cut down with their swords and
axes any those who should attempt to quit
their post i was kindly assured this myself
by the old kempe kinfauns as he was called
this good sir patrick's father then our provost
he was a grandson the red rover
tom montreville and a likely man to keep
his word which he addressed to me in especial
because a night much discomfort may have
made me look paler than usual and besides i
was but a lad
and did his exhortation add to your fear
or your resolution said eachin who seemed
very attentive
to my resolution answered simon for
i think nothing can make a man so bold to face
one danger at some distance in his front as
the knowledge another close behind him
to push him forward well i mounted the
walls in tolerable heart and was placed with
others on the spey tower being accounted a
good bowman but a very cold fit seized me as
i saw the english in great order with their
archers in front and their menatarms behind
marching forward to the attack in strong columns
three in number they came on steadily
and some us would fain have shot at
them but it was strictly forbidden and we were
obliged to remain motionless sheltering ourselves
behind the battlement as we best might
as the southron formed their long ranks into
lines each man occupying his place as by magic
and preparing to cover themselves by large
shields called passes which they planted before
them i again felt a strange breathlessness
and some desire to go home for a glass distilled
waters but as i looked aside i saw the
worthy kempe kinfauns bending a large crossbow
and i thought it pity he should waste the
bolt on a truehearted scotsman when so many
english were in presence so i e'en staid where
i was being in a comfortable angle formed by
two battlements the english then strode forward
and drew their bowstrings not to the
breast as your highland kerne do but to the
ear and sent off their volleys swallowtails
before we could call on st andrew i winked
when i saw them haul up their tackle and i
believe i started as the shafts began to rattle
against the parapet but looking round me and
seeing none hurt but john squalls the towncrier
whose jaws were pierced through with
a clothyard shaft i took heart grace and
shot in my turn with good will and good aim
a little man i shot at who had just popped out
from behind his target dropt with a shaft
through his shoulder the provost cried 
well stitched simon glover saint john
for his own town my fellow craftsmen 
shouted i though i was then but an apparent
the honour our guild and if you
will believe me in the rest the skirmish which
was ended by the foes drawing off i drew bowstring
and loosed shaft as calmly as if i had
been shooting at butts instead men's breasts
i gained some credit and i have ever afterwards
thought that in case necessity for with me
it had never been matter choice i should not
have lost it again and this is all i can tell 
warlike experience in battle other dangers i
have had which i have endeavoured to avoid
like a wise man or when they were inevitable
i have faced them like a true one upon other
terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
scotland
i understand your tale said eachin but
i shall find it difficult to make you credit mine
knowing the race which i am descended and
especially him whom we have this day laid in
the tomb well that he lies where he will never
learn what you are now to hear look my father
 the light which i bear grows short and
pale a few minutes will extinguish it but before
it expires the hideous tale will be told 
father i am a coward it h said at last
and the secret my disgrace is in keeping 
another 
the young man sunk back in a species syncope
produced by the agony his mind as he
made the fatal communication the glover
moved as well by fear as by compassion applied
himself to recall him to life and succeeded in
doing so but not in restoring him to composure
he hid his face with his hands and his tears
flowed plentifully and bitterly
for our lady's sake be composed said
the old man and recall the vile word i know
you better than yourself you are no coward
but only too young and inexperienced ay and
somewhat too quick fancy to have the steady
valour a bearded man i would hear no
other man say that you conachar without
gidng him the lie you are no coward i have
seen high sparks spirit fly from you even on
slight enough provocation
high sparks pride and passion said the
unfortunate youth but when saw you them
supported by the resolution that should have
backed them the sparks you speak fell on
my dastardly heart as on a piece ice which
could catch fire from nothing if ray offended
pride urged me to strike my weakness mind
prompted me the next moment to fly
want habit said simon it is by
clambering over walls that youths learn to scale
precipices begin with slight feuds exercise
daily the arms your country in tourney with
your followers
and what leisure is there for this exclaimed
the young chief starting as if something
horrid had occurred to his imagination
how many days are there betwixt this hour
and palm sunday and what is to chance then 
a list inclosed from which no man can stir
more than the poor bear who is chained to his
stake sixty living men the best and fiercest
one alone excepted which albyn can send
down from her mountains all athirst for each
other's blood while a king and his nobles and
shouting thousands besides attend as at a theatre
to encourage their demoniac fury blows
clang and blood flows thicker faster redder 
they rush on each other like madmen they tear
each other like wild hearts the wounded are
trodden to death amid the feet their companions
 blood ebbs arms become weak but
there must be no parley no truce no interruption
while any the maimed wretches remain
alive here is no crouching behind battlements
no fighting with missile weapons all is hand
to hand till hands can no longer be raised to
maintain the ghastly conflict if such a field
is so horrible in idea what think you it will be
in reality 
the glover remained silent
i say again what think you 
i can only pity you conachar said simon
 it is hard to be the descendant a lofty
line the son a noble father the leader by
birth a gallant array and yet to want or
think you want for still i trust the fault lies
much in a quick fancy that overestimates danger
to want that dogged quality which is possessed
by every gamecock that is worth a handful
 corn every hound that is worth a mess
 offal but how chanced it that with such a
consciousness inability to fight in this battle
you proffered even now to share your chief dom
with my daughter your power must depend on
your fighting this combat and in that catharine
cannot help you
you mistake old man replied eachin 
were catharine to look kindly on the earnest
love i bear her it would carry me against the
front the enemies with the mettle a warhorse
overwhelming as my sense weakness
is the feeling that catharine looked on would
give me strength say yet oh say yet she
shall be mine if we gain the combat and not
the gow chrom himself whose heart is a
piece with his anvil ever went to battle so light
as i shall do one strong passion is conquered
by another
this is folly conachar cannot the recollections
 your interest your honour your
kindled do as much to stii your courage as
the thoughts a brent browed lass fie upon
you man 
you tell me but what i have told myself 
but it is in vain replied eachin with a sigh
it is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous
be it from constitution be it as our highland
callimachus will say front the milk the
white doe be it from my peaceful education
and the experience your strict restraint be
it as you think from an overheated fancy
which paints danger yet more dangerous and
ghastly than it is in reality i cannot tell but
i know my failing and yes it must be said 
so sorely dread that i cannot conquer it that
could i have your consent to my wishes on such
terms i would caen here make a pause renounce
the rank i have assumed and retire into
humble life
what turn glover at last conachar said
simon this beats the legend st crispin
nay nay your hand was not framed for that 
you shall spoil me no more doeskins
jest not said eachin i am serious
if i cannot labour i will bring wealth enough
to live without it they will proclaim me recreant
with horn and warpipe let them do
so catharine will love me the better that i
have preferred the paths peace to those 
bloodshed and father clement shall teach us
to pity and forgive the world which will load
us with reproaches that wound not i shall
be the happiest men catharine will enjoy
all that unbounded affection can confer upon
her and will be freed from apprehension 
the sights and sounds horror which your
illassorted match would have prepared for her 
and you father glover shall occupy your
chimneycorner the happiest and most honoured
man that ever 
hold eachin i pr'ythee hold said the
glover the fir light with which this discourse
must terminate burns very low and i
would speak a word in my turn and plain dealing
is best though it may vex or perhaps enrage
you let me these visions by saying at
once catharine can never be yours a glove
is the emblem faith and a man my craft
should therefore less than any other break his
own catharine's hand is promised promised
to a man whom you may hate but whom you
must honour to henry the armourer the
match is fitting by degree agreeable to their
mutual wishes and i have given my promise
it is best to be plain at once resent my refusal
as you will i am wholly in your power but
nothing shall make me break my word
the glover spoke thus decidedly because he
was aware from experience that the very irritable
disposition his former apprentice yielded
in most cases to stern and decided resolution
yet recollecting where he was it was
with some feelings fear that he saw the dying
flame leap up and spread a flash light
on the visage eachin which seemed pale
as the grave while his eye rolled like that 
a maniac in his fever fit the light instantly
sunk down and died and simon felt a momentary
terror lest he should have to dispute
for his life with the youth whom he knew to
be capable violent actions when highly excited
however short a period his nature could
support the measures which his passion commenced
he was relieved by the voice eachin
who muttered in a hoarse and altered
tone 
let what we have spoken this night rest
in silence for ever if thou hring'st it to light
thou wert better dig thine own grave
thus speaking the door the hut opened
admitting a gleam moonshine the form 
the retiring chief crossed it for an instant the
hurdle door was then closed and the hut left
in darkness
simon glover felt relieved when a conversation
fraught with offence and danger was
thus peaceably terminated but he remained
deeply affected by the condition hector marian
whom he had himself bred up
the poor child said he to be called upto
a place eminence only to be hurled from
it with contempt what he told me i partly
knew having often remarked that conachar
was more prone to quarrel than to fight but
this overpowering faintheartiness which neither
shame nor necessity can overcome i
though no sir william wallace cannot conceive
and to propose himself for a husband to
my daughter as if a bride were to find courage
for herself and the bridegroom no no catharine
must wed a man to whom she may say
 husband spare your enejny not one in
whose behalf she must cry generous enemy
spare my husband 
tired out with these reflections the old man
at length fell asleep in the morning he was
awakened by his friend the booshalloch who
with something a blank visage proposed to
him to return to his abode on the meadow at
the ballough that is the discharge the lake
into the river he apologized that the chief
could not see simon glover that morning being
busied with things about the expected combat
 and that eachin maclan thought the residence
at the ballough would be safest for simon
glover's health and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection
and accommodation
niel booshalloch dilated on these circumstances
to gloss over the neglect implied in the
chief's dismissing bis visitor without a particular
audience
his father knew better said the herdsman
 but where should he have learned
manners poor thing and bred up among your
perth burghers who excepting yourself neighbour
glover who speak gaelic as well as i do
are a race incapable civility 
simon glover it may be well believed felt
none the want respect which his friend
resented on his account on the contrary he
greatly preferred the quiet residence the
good herdsman to the tumultuous hospitality
 the daily festival the chief even if there
had not just passed an interview with eachin
upon a subject which it would be most painful
to revive
to the ballough therefore he quietly retreated
where could he have been secure catharine's
safety his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough his amusement was sailing on the
lake in a little skiff which a highland boy managed
while the old man angled he frequently

ly landed on the little island where be mused
over the tomb his old friend gilchrist marian
and made friends with the monks presenting
the prior with gloves martin's fur and
the superior officers with each them a pair
made from the skin the wildcat the cutting
and stitching these little presents served
to beguile the time after sunset while the
family the herdsman crowded around admiring
his address and listening to the tales
and songs vith which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening
it must be confessed that the cautious glover
avoided the conversation father clement
whom he erroneously considered as rather the
author his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer
 them i will not he thought to please his
fancies lose the good will these kind monks
which may be one day useful to me i have
suffered enough by his preachments already i
trow little the wiser and much the poorer
have they made me no no catharine and
clement may think as they will but i will take
the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated
vol iii k
hound at the call his master submit to a
plentiful course haircloth and whipcord
disburse a lusty mulct and become whole with
the church again
more than a fortnight had passed since the
glover had arrived at ballough and he began
to wonder that he had not heard news catharine
or henry wynd to whom he concluded
the provost had communicated the plan
and place his retreat he knew the stout
smith dared not come up into the clan quhele
country on account various feuds with the
inhabitants and with each in himself while
bearing the name conachar but yet the
glover thought henry might have found means
to send him a message or a token by some one
 the various couriers who passed and repassed
between the court and the headquarters the
clan quhele in order to concert the terms 
the impending combat the march the parties
to perth and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment it was now the middle 
march and the fatal palm sunday was fast approaching

whilst time was thus creeping on the exiled
glover had not even once set eyes upon his
former apprentice the care that was taken
to attend to his wants and convenience in every
respect showed that he was not forgotten but
yet when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing
through the woods he usually made it a point
to choose his walk in a different direction one
morning however he found himself unexpectedly
in eachin's close neighbourhood with
scarce leisure to avoid him and thus it happened

as simon strolled pensively through a little
sylvan glade surrounded on either side with
tall forest trees mixed with underwood a white
doe broke from the thicket closely pursued by
two deer greyhounds one which griped her
haunch the other her throat and pulled her
down within half a furlong the glover who
was something startled at the suddenness the
incident the near and piercing blast a
horn and the baying a slowhound made
simon aware that the hunters were close behind
and on the trace the deer hallooing
and the sound men running through the copse
were heard close at hand a moment's recollection
would have satisfied simon that his best
way was to stand fast or retire slowly and
leave it to eachin to acknowledge his presence
or not as he should see cause but his desire
 shunning the young man had grown into a
kind instinct and in the alarm finding
him so near simon hid himself in a bush 
hazels mixed with holly which altogether concealed
him he had hardly done so ere eachin
rosy with exercise dashed from the thicket into
the open glade accompanied by his fosterfather
torquil the oak the latter with equal
strength and address turned the struggling
hind on her back and holding her fore feet in
his right hand while he knelt on her body offered
his skene with the left to the young
chief that he might cut the animal's throat
it may not be torquil do thine office and
take the assay thyself i must not kill the
likeness my fostermother
this was spoken with a melancholy smile
while a tear at the same time stood in the
speaker's eye torquil stared at his young
chief for an instant then drew his sharp woodknife
across the creature's throat with a cut
so swift and steady that the weapon reached
the back bone then rising on his feet and
again fixing a long piercing look on his chief
he said as much as i have done to that
hind would i do to any living man whose ears
could have heard my fault fosterson so much
as name a white doe and couple the word with
hector's name 
if simon had no reason before to keep himself
concealed this speech torquil furnished
him with a pressing one
it cannot be concealed father torquil
said eachin it will all out to the broad day
what will out what will to broad day 
asked torquil in surprise
it is the fatal secret thought simon and
now if this huge privy councillor cannot keep
silence i shall be made answerable i suppose
for eachin's disgrace having been blown
abroad
thinking thus anxiously he availed himself
at the same time his position to see as much
as he could what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confident impelled by that
spirit curiosity which prompts us in the most
momentous as well as the most trivial occasions
 life and which is sometimes found to
subsist in company with great personal fear
as torquil listened to what eachin communicated
the young man sank into his arms and
supporting himself on his shoulder concluded
his confession by a whisper into his ear torquit
seemed to listen with such amazement as
to make him incapable crediting his ears
as if to be certain that it was eachin who
spoke he gradually roused the youth from his
reclining posture and holding him up in some
measure by a grasp on bis shoulder fixed on
him an eye that seemed enlarged and at the
same time turned to stone by the marvels he
listened to and so wild waxed the old man's
visage after he had heard the murmured communication
that simon glover apprehended he
would cast the youth from him as a dishonoured
thug ill which case he might have lighted
on the very copse in which he lay concealed
and occasioned his discovery in a manner equally
painful and dangerous but the passions 
torquil who entertained for his fosterchild
even a double portion that passionate fondness
which always attends that connexion in
the highlands took a different turn
i believe it not he exclaimed it is
false thy father's child false thy mother's
son falsest my fault i offer my gage to
heaven and hell and will maintain the combat
with him that shall call it true thou hast been
spellbound by an evil eye my darling and
the fainting which you call cowardice is the
work magic i remember the bat that struck
the torch out on the hour that thou wert born
that hour grief and joy cheer up my
beloved thou shalt with me to zona and the
good st columbus with the whole choir 
blessed saints and angels who ever favoured
thy race shall take from thee the heart the
white doe and return that which they have
stolen from thee
eachin listened with a look as if he would
fain have believed the words the comforter
but torquil he said supposing this
might avail us the fatal day approaches and
if i go to the lists i dread me we shall be
shamed
it cannot be it shall not said torquil
hell shall not prevail so far we will steep
thy sword in holy water place vervain st
john'swort and rowantree in thy crest we
will surround thee i and thy eight brethren 
thou shalt be safe as in a castle
again the youth helplessly muttered something
which from the dejected tone in which
it was spoken simon could not understand
while torquil's deep tones in reply fell full and
distinct upon his ear
yes there may be a chance withdrawing
thee from the conflict thou art the youngest
who is to draw blade now hear me and
thou shalt know what it is to have a fosterfather's
love and how far it exceeds the love even
 kind the youngest on the indenture the
clan chattan is ferquhard day his father
slew mine and the red blood is seething hot
between us i looked to palm sunday as the
term that should cool it but mark thou
would'st have thought that the blood in the
veins this ferquhard day and in mine would
not have mingled had they been put into the
same vessel yet hath he cast the eyes his love
upon my only daughter eva the fairest our
maidens think with what feelings i heard the
news it was as if a wolf from the skirts 
arragon had said give me thy child in wedlock
torquil my child thought not thus she
loves ferquhard and weeps away her colour
and strength in dread the approaching battle
let her give him but a sign favour and well
i know he will forget kith and kin forsake the
field and fly with her to the desert
he the youngest the champions clan
chattan being absent i the youngest the
clan quhele may be excused from combat
said eachiu blushing at the mean chance 
safety thus opened to him
see now my chief said torquil and
judge my thoughts towards thee others might
give thee their own lives and that their sons
i sacrifice to thee the honour my house
my friend my father repeated the chief
folding torquil to his bosom what a base
wretch am i that have a spirit dastardly enough
to avail myself your sacrifice 
t speak not that green woods have ears
let us back to the camp and send our gillies
for the venison back dogs and follow at
heel
the slowhound or lymedog luckily for simon
had drenched his nose in the blood the
deer else he might have found the glover's lair
in the thicket but its more acute properties 
scent being lost it followed tranquilly with the
gazehounds
when the hunters were out sight and hearing
the glover arose greatly relieved by their
departure and began to move off in the opposite
direction as fast as his age permitted his
first reflection was on the fidelity the fosterfather

the wild mountain heart is faithful and
true yonder man is more like the giants in
romaunt than a man mould like ourselves
and yet christians might take an example from
him for his lealt a simple contrivance this
though to finger a man off their enemies chequer
as if there would not be twenty the
wildcats ready to supply his place
thus thought the glover not aware that the
strictest proclamations were issued prohibiting
any the two contending clans their friends
allies and dependents from coming within fifty
miles perth during a week before and a
week after the combat which regulation was to
be enforced by armed men
so soon as our friend simon arrived at the
habitation the herdsman he found other news
awaiting him they were brought by father
clement who came in a pilgrim's cloak or
dalmatic ready to commence his return to the
southwards and desirous to take leave his
companion in exue or to accept him as a travelling
companion
but what said the citizen has so suddenly
induced you to return within the reach
 danger 
have you not heard said father clement
that march and his english allies having retired
into england before the earl douglas
the good earl has applied himself to redress the
evils the commonwealth and hath written to
the court letters desiring that the warrant for
the high court commission against heresy be
withdrawn as a trouble to men's consciences 
that the nomination robert de wardle to be
prelate st andrews be referred to the parliament
with sundry other things pleasing to
the commons now most the nobles that
are with the king at perth and with them sir
patrick charteris your worthy provost have
declared for the proposals the douglas the
duke albany hath agreed to them whether
from goodwill or policy i know not the good
king is easily persuaded to mild and gentle
courses and thus are the jawteeth the oppressors
dashed to pieces in their sockets and
the prey snatched from their ravening talons
will you with me to the lowlands or do you
abide here a little space 
niel booshalloch saved bis friend the trouble
 reply
he bad the cheers authority he said
for saying that simon glover should abide
until the champions went down to the battle
in this answer the citizen saw something not
quite consistent with his own perfect freedom 
volition but he cared little for it at the time
as it furnished a good apology for not travelling
along with the clergyman
an exemplary man he said to his friend
niel booshalloch as soon as father clement
had taken leave a great scholar and a great
saint it is a pity almost he is not in danger
to be burned as his sermon at the stake would
convert thousands o niel booshalloch father
clement's pile would be a sweet savouring
sacrifice and a beacon to all devout christians
but what would the burning a barrel ignorant
burgess like me serve men offer not up
old glove leather for incense nor are beacons
fed with undressed hides i trow sooth to
speak i have too little learning and too much
fear to get credit by the affair and therefore
i should in our homely phrase have both the
scathe and the scorn
true for you answered the herdsman
chapter vii
we must return to the characters our dramatic
narrative whom we left at perth when
we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
to kinfauns and from that hospitable mansion
traced the course simon to loch tay 
and the prince as the highest personage claims
our immediate attention this rash and inconsiderate
young man endured with some impatience
his sequestered residence with the lord
high constable with whose company otherwise
in every respect satisfactory he became
dissatisfied from no other reason than that he
held in some degree the character his warvigo

der incensed against his uncle and displeased
with his father he longed not unnaturally for
the society sir john ramorny on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself
for amusement and though he would have resented
the imputation as an insult for guidance
and direction he therefore sent him a summons
to attend him providing his health permitted
and directed him to come by water to
a little pavilion in the high constable's garden
which like that sir john's own lodgings
ran down to the tay in renewing an intimacy
so dangerous rothsay only remembered
that he had been sir john ramorny's munificent
friend while sir john on receiving the
imitation only recollected on his part the
capricious insults he had sustained from his patron
the loss his hand and the lightness
with which he had treated the subject and the
readiness with which rothsay had abandoned
his cause in the matter the bonnetmaker's
slaughter he laughed bitterly when he read
the prince's billet
eviot he said mau a stout boat with
six trusty men trusty men mark me lose
not a moment and bid d wining instantly come
hither heaven smiles on us my trusty friend
he said to the medicine i was but beating
my brains how to get access to this fickle boy
and here he sends to invite me
hem i see the matter very clearly said
d wining heaven smiles on some untoward
consequences he he he 
no matter the trap is ready and it is baited
too my friend with what would lure the boy
from a sanctuary though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard yet is
it scarce necessary his own weariness himself
would have done the job get thy matters
ready thou goes with us write to him as
i cannot that we come instantly to attend his
commands and do it clerkly he reads welland
that he owes to me
he will be your valiancy's debtor for more
knowledge before he dies he he he but
is your bargain sure with the duke albany 
vol iii l
 enough to gratify my ambition thy avarice
and the revenge both aboard aboard
and speedily let eviot throw in a few flasks 
the choicest wine and some cold baked meats
but your arm my lord sir john does
it not pain you 
 the throbbing my heart silences the
pain my wound it beats as it would burst
ray bosom
heaven forbid said dwining adding
in a low voice it would be a strange sight if
it should i should like to dissect it save that
its stony case would spoil my best instruments

in a few minutes they were in the boat
while a speedy messenger carried the note to
the prince
rothsay was seated with the constable after
their noontide repast he was sullen and silent
and the earl had just asked whether it
was his pleasure that the table should be cleared
when a note delivered to the prince changed
at once his aspect
 as you will he said i go to the pavilion
in the garden always with permission
 my lord constable to receive my late master
 the horse
 my lord said lord errol
 ay my lord must i ask permission twice 
 no surely my lord answered the constable
 but has your royal highness recollected
that sir john ramorny 
has not the plague i hope replied the
duke rothsay come errol you would
play the surly turnkey but it is not in your
nature farewell for half an hour
a new folly said errol as the prince
flinging open a lattice the groundparlour in
which they sate stept out into the garden a
new folly to call back that villain to his councils
but he is infatuated
the prince in the meantime looked back
and said hastily 
your lordship's good housekeeping will afford
us a flask or two and a slight collation in
the pavilion i love the al fresco the river
the constable bowed and gave the necessary
orders so that sir john found the materials
 good cheer ready displayed when landing
from his barge he entered the pavilion
it grieves my heart to see your highness
under restraint said ramorny with a wellexecuted
appearance sympathy
 that grief thine will grieve mine said
the prince i am sure here has errol and
a right truehearted lord he is so tired me with
grave looks and something like grave lessons
that he has driven me back to thee thou reprobate
from whom as i expect nothing good i
may perhaps obtain something entertaining
yet ere we say more it was foul work that
upon the eastern's even ramorny i well hope
thou gayest not aim to it
on my honour my lord a simple mistake
 the brute bonthron i did but hint to him
that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by
whom i had lost a hand and lo you my knave
makes a double mistake he takes one man for
another and instead the barton he uses the
axe
it is well that it went no farther small matter
for the bonnetmaker but i had never forts

given you had the armourer fallen there is not
his match in britain but i hope they hanged
the villain high enough 
if thirty feet might serve replied ramorn

pah no more him said rothsay his
wretched name makes the good wine taste 
blood and what are the news in perth ramorn
 how stands it with the bona robes
and the galliard 
little halliards stirring my lord answered
the knight all eyes are turned to the
motions the black douglas who comes with
five thousand chosen men to put us all to rights
as if he were bound for another otterburn it
is said he is to be lieutenant again it is certain
many have declared for his faction
it is time then my feet were free said
rothsay otherwise i may find a worse warder
than errol
ah my lord were you once away from
this place you might make as bold a head as
douglas
ramorny said the prince gravely i
have but a confused remembrance your once
having proposed something horrible to me beware
 such counsel i would be free i would
have my person at my own disposal but i will
never levy arms against my father nor those it
pleases him to trust
 it was only for your royal highnesses personal
freedom that i was presuming to speak
answered ramorny were i in your grace's
place i would get me into that good boat which
hovers on the tay and drop quietly down to
fife where you have many friends and make
free to take possession falkland it is a royal
castle and though the king has bestowed it in
gift on your uncle yet surely even if the grant
were not subject to challenge your grace might
make free with the residence so near a relative

he hath made free with mine said the
duke as the stewartry renfrew can telli
but stay ramorny hold did i not hear errol
say that the lady marjory douglas whom
they call duchess rothsay is at falkland i
would neither dwell with that lady nor insult
her by dislodging her
the lady was there my lord replied ramorn
 but i have sure advice that she is
gone to meet her father
ha to animate the douglas against me 
or perhaps to beg him to spare me providing i
come on my knees to her bed as pilgrims say
the emirs and admirals upon whom a saracen
soldan bestows a daughter in marriage are
bound to do ramorny i will act by the douglas's
own saying it is better to hear the lark
sing than the mouse squeak i will keep both
foot and hand from fetters
no place fitter than falkland replied ramorn
 i have enough good yeomen to
keep the place and should your highness wish
to leave it a brief ride reaches the sea in three
directions
you speak well but we shall die gloom
yonder neither mirth music nor maidens
 said the heedless prince
pardon me noble duke but though the
lady marjory douglas be departed like an errant
dame in romance to implore succour 
her doughty sire there is i may say a lovelier
i am sure a younger maiden cither presently
at falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither your highness has not forgotten the
fair maid perth 
 forget the prettiest wench in scotland 
no any more than thou hast forgotten the hand
that thou hadst in the curfew street onslaught
on st valentine's eve
the hand that i had your highness
would say the hand that i lost as certain
as i shall never regain it catharine glover is
or will soon be at falkland i will not flatter
your highness by saying she expects to meet
you in truth she proposes to place herself under
the protection the lady marjory
the little traitress said the prince she
too to turn against me she deserves punishment
ramorny
i trust your grace will make her penance
a gentle one replied the knight
faith i would have been her father confessor
long ago but i have ever found her coy
opportunity was lacking my lord replied
ramorny and time presses even now
nay i am but too apt for a frolic but my
father 
he is personally safe said ramorny
and as much at freedom as ever he can be 
while your highness 
must brook fetters conjugal or literal i
know it yonder comes douglas with his
daughter in his hand as haughty and as harshfeatured
as himself bating touches age
and at falkland sits in solitude the fairest
wench in scotland said ramorny here
is penance and restraint yonder is joy and freedom

thou hast prevailed most sage counsellor
replied rothsay but mark you it shall bethe
last my frolics
i trust so replied ramorny for when
at liberty you may make a good accommodation
with your royal father
i will write to him ramorny get the writ
 no i cannot put my thoughts
in words do thou write
your royal highness forgets said ramorn
pointing to his mutilated arm
ah that cursed hand yours what
can we do 
 so please your highness answered his
counsellor if you would use the hand the
medicine dwining he writes like a clerk
hath he a hint the circumstances is he
possessed them 
fully said ramorny and stepping to
the window he called dwining from the boat
he entered the presence the prince scotland
creeping as if he trode upon eggs with
downcast eyes and a frame that seemed shrunk
up by a sense awe produced by the occasion
there fellow are writingmaterials i will
make trial you thou know'st the case 
place my conduct to my father in a fair light
dwining sat down and in a few minutes
wrote a letter which he handed to sir john
ramorny
why the devil has aided thee dwining
said the knight listen my dear lord 
respected father and liege sovereign know
that important considerations induce me to take
my departure from this your court purposing
to make my abode at falkland both as the seat
 my dearest uncle albany with whom i know
your majesty would desire me to use all familiarity
and as the residence one from whom
i have been too long estranged and with whom
i haste to exchange vows the closest affection
from henceforward
the duke rothsay and ramorny laughed
aloud and the physician who had listened
to his own scroll as if it were a sentence 
death encouraged by their applause raised his
eyes uttered faintly his chuckling note he 
he and was again grave and silent as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds reverent respect

admirable said the prince admirable
 the old man will apply all this to the
duchess as they call her rothsay d wining
thou should'st be a secrets to his holiness the
pope who sometimes it is said wants a scribe
that can make one word record two meanings
i will subscribe it and have the praise the
device
and now my lord said ramorny sealing
the letter and leaving it behind will you
not to boat 
not till my chamberlain attends vail some
clothes and necessaries and you may call my
sewer also
my lord said ramorny time presses
and preparation will but excite suspicion your
officers will follow with the mails tomorrow
for tonight i trust my poor service may suffice
to wait on you at table and chamber
nay this time it is thou who forgets said
the prince touching the wounded arm with his
walkingrod recollect man thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point a goodly
sewer or valet the mouth 
ramorny grinned with rage and pain for his
wound though in a way healing was still
highly sensitive and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble
will your highness now be pleased to take
boat
not till i take leave the lord constable
rothsay must not slip away like a thief from
a prison from the house errol summon
him hither
my lord duke said ramorny it maybe
dangerous to our plan
to the devil with danger thy plan and
thyself i must and will act to errol as becomes
us both
the earl entered agreeable to the prince's
summons
i gave you this troublemy lord said
rothsay with the dignified courtesy which he
knew so well how to assume to thank you for
your hospitality and your good company i can
enjoy them no longer as pressing affairs call me
to falkland
 my lord said the lord high constable
i trust your grace remembers that you are
under ward
how under ward if i am a prisoner
speak plainly if not i will take my freedom
to depart
 i would my lord your highness would
request his majesty's permission for this journey
there will be much displeasure
mean you displeasure against yourself my
lord or against me 
i have already said your highness lies inward
here but if you determine to break it i
have no warrant god forbid to put force on
your inclinations i can but entreat your
highness for your own sake 
 my own interests i am the best judge 
good evening to you my lord
the wilful prince stepped into the boat with
dwining and ramorny and waiting for no
other attendance eviot pushed off the vessel
which descended the tay rapidly by the assistance
 sail and oar and the ebbtide
for some space the duke rothsay appeared
silent and moody nor did his companions interrupt
his reflections he raised his head at
length and said my father loves a jest and
when all is over he will take this frolic at no
more serious rate than it deserves a fit 
youth with which he will deal as he has with
others yonder my masters shows the old
hold kinfauns frowning above the tay
now tell me john ramorny how thou hast
dealt to get the fair maid perth out the
hands yonder bullheaded provost for errol
told me it was rumoured that she was under his
protection
truly she was my lord with the purpose
 being transferred to the patronage the
duchess i mean the lady marjory 
douglas now this beetleheaded provost who
is after all but a piece blundering valiancy
has like most such a retainer some slyness
and cunning whom he uses in all his dealings
and whose suggestions he generally considers as
his own ideas whenever i would possess myself
 a landward baron i address myself to
such a confident who in the present case is
called kitt henshaw an old skipper upon the
tay and who having in his time sailed as far
as ampere holds with sir patrick charteris
the respect due to one who has seen foreign
countries this his agent i have made my own
and by his means have insinuated various apologies
in order to postpone the departure 
catharine for falkland
but to what good purpose 
i know not if it is wise to tell your highness
lest you should disapprove my views 
i meant the officers the commission for inquiry
into heretical opinions should have found
the fair maid at kinfauns for our beauty is a
peevish selfwilled swerve from the church 
and certes i designed that the knight should
have come in for his share the fines and confiscations
that were about to he inflicted the
monks were eager enough to be at him seeing
he hath had frequent disputes with them about
the salmon ty the
but wherefore wouldst thou have ruined
the knight's fortunes and brought the beautiful
young woman to the stake perchance 
pshaw my lord duke monks never
burn pretty maidens an old woman might
have been in some danger and as for my lord
provost as they call him if they had clipped off
some his fat acres it would have been some
atonement for the brave he put on me in saint
john's church
methinks john it was but a base revenge
said rothsay
rest ye contented my lord he that cannot
right himself by the hand must use his
head well that chance was over by the tenderhearted
douglas's declaring in favour 
tender conscience and then my lord old hens


shaw found no further objections to carrying
the fair maid perth to falkland not to
share the dulness the lady marjory's society
as sir patrick charteris and she herself doth
opine but to keep your highness from tiring
when we return from hunting in the park
there was again a long pause in which the
prince seemed to muse deeply at length he
spoke ramorny i have a scruple in this
matter but if i name it to thee the devil sophistry
with which thou art possessed will argue
it out me as it has done many others this
girl is the most beautiful one excepted whom
i ever saw or knew and i like her the more
that she bears some features elizabeth 
dunbar but she i mean catharine glover is
contracted and presently to be wedded to henry
the armourer a craftsman unequalled for skill
and a manatarms yet unmatched in the barrace
to follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong
your highness will not expect me to be
very solicitous henry smith's interest said
ramorny looking at his wounded arm
vol iii m

by saint andrew with his shored cross
this disaster thine is too much harped upon
john ramorny others are content with putting
a finger into every man's pie but thou
must thrust in thy whole gory hand it is
done and cannot be undone let it be forgotten

nay my lord you allude to it more frequently
than i answered the knight in derision
it is true while i but i can be silent
on the subject if i cannot forget it
well then i tell thee that i have scruple
about this intrigue dost thou remember when
we went in a frolic to hear father clement
preach or rather to see this fair heretic that he
spoke as touchingly as a minstrel about the rich
man taking away thepoor man's onlyewe lamb
a great matter indeed answered sir
john that this churl's wife's eldest son
should be fathered by the prince scotland 
how many earls would covet the like fate for
their fair countesses and how many that have
had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse
for it
 and if i might presume to speak said the
medicine the ancient laws scotland assigned
such a privilege to every feudal lord over
his female vassals though lack spirit and love
 money hath made many exchange it for gold
i require no argument to urge me to be
kind to a pretty woman but this catharine has
been ever cold to me said the prince
nay my lord said ramorny if young
handsome and a prince you know not how to
make yourself acceptable to a fine woman it is
not for me to say more
and if it were not far too great audacity
in me to speak again i would say quoth the
leech that all perth knows that the goto
chrom never was the maiden's choice but fairly
forced upon her by her father i know for
certain that she refused him repeatedly
nay if thou canst assure us that the
case is much altered said rothsay vulcan
was a smith as well as harry wynd he would
needs wed venus and our chronicles tell us
what came it
 then long may lady venus live and he
worshipped said sir john ramorny and
success to the gallant knight mars who goes
awooing to her goddessship 
the discourse took a gay and idle turn for a
few minutes but the duke roth say soon
dropped it i have left he said yonder
air the prisonhouse behind me and yet my
spirits scarce revive i feel that drowsy not
unpleasing yet melancholy mood that comes
over us when exhausted by exercise or satiated
with pleasure some music now stealing on
the ear yet not loud enough to make us lift the
eye were a treat for the gods
your grace has but to speak your wishes
and the nymphs the tay are as favourable as
the fair ones upon the shore hark it is a
lute
a lute said the duke rothsay listening
 it is and rarely touched i should remember
that dying fall steer towards the boat
from whence the music comes
it is old henshaw said ramorny working
up the stream how skipper 
the boatmen answered the hail and drew up
alongside the prince's barge
ol ho my old friend said the prince
recognising the figure as well as the appointments
 the french glee woman louise i
think i owe thee something for being the means
 thy having a fright at least upon st valentine's
day into this boat with thee lute
puppy dog scrip and all i will prefer thee to
a lady's service who shall feed thy very cur on
capons and canary
i trust your highness will consider said
ramorny
i will consider nothing but my pleasure
john pray do thou be so complying as to
consider it also
is it indeed to a lady's service yoa would
promote me said the gleemaiden and
where does she dwell 
at falkland answered the prince
oh i have heard that great lady said
louise and will you indeed prefer me to
your right royal consort's service 
i will by my honour whenever i receive
her as such mark that reservation john said
he aside to ramorny
the persons who were in the boat caught up
the tidings and concluding a reconciliation was
about to take place betwixt the royal couple
exhorted louise to profit by her good fortune
and add herself to the duchess rothsay's
train several offered her some acknowledgment
for the exercise her talents
during this moment delay ramorny whispered
to d wining make in knave with some
objection this addition is one too many rouse
thy wits while i speak a word with henshaw
if i might presume to speak said dining
 as one who have made my studies both
in spain and arabia i would say my lord that
the sickness has appeared in edinburgh and
that there may be risk in admitting this young
wanderer into your highness's vicinity
ah and what is it to thee said rothsay
whether i choose to be poisoned by the pestilence
or the pothecary must thou too needs
thwart my humour 
while the prince thus silenced the remonstrances
 dwining sir john ramorny had
snatched a moment to learn from henshaw that
i
the removal the duchess rothsay from
falkland was still kept profoundly secret and
that catharine glover would arrive there that
evening or the next morning in expectation 
being taken under the noble lady's protection
the duke rothsay deeply plunged in
thought received this intimation so coldly that
ramorny took the liberty remonstrating
this my lord he said is playing the spoiled
child fortune you wish for liberty it
comes you wish for beauty it awaits you with
j must so much delay as to render the boon more precious
even your slightest desires seem a law to
the fates for you desire music when it seems
most distant and the lute and song are at your
hand these things so sent should be enjoyed
else we are but like petted children who break
and throw from them tle toys they have wept
themselves sick for
 to enjoy pleasure ramorny said the
prince a man should have suffered pain as
it requires fasting to gain a good appetite we
who can have all for a wish little enjoy that
all when we have possessed it seest thou yonder
thick cloud which is about to burst to rain 
it seems to stifle me the waters look dark
and lurid the shores have lost their beautiful
form 
my lord forgive your servant said ramorn
 you indulge a powerful imagination
as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to
rear until he falls back on his master and crushes
him i pray you shake off this lethargy shall
the gleemaiden make some music 
let her but it must be melancholy all
mirth would at this moment jar on my ear
the maiden sung a melancholy dirge in norman
french the words which the following
is an imitation were united to a tune as
doleful as they are themselves

yes thou may'st sigh
and look once more at all around
at stream and bank and sky and ground
thy life its final course has found
and thou must die
yes lay thee down
and while thy struggling pulses flutter
bid the gray monk his soulmass mutter
and the deep bell its deathtone utter
thy life is gone

be not afraid
tis but a pang and then a thrill
a fever tit and then a chill 
and then an human ill
for thou art dead
the prince made no observation on the music
 and the maiden at ramorny's beck went
on from time to time with her minstrel craft
until the evening sunk down into rain first
soft and gentle at length in great quantities
and accompanied by a cold wind there was
neither cloak nor covering for the prince and
he sullenly rejected that which ramorny offered

it is not for rothsay to wear your cast
garments sir john this melted snow which i
feel pierce me to the very marrow i am now
encountering by your fault why did you presume
to put off the boat without my servants
and apparel 
ramorny did not attempt an exculpation for
he knew the prince was in one those humours
when to enlarge upon a grievance was
more pleasing to him than to have his mouth
stopped by any reasonable apology in sullen silence
or ainid unsuppressed chiding the boat arrived
at the fishing village newbury the
party landed and found horses in readiness
which indeed ramorny had long since provided
for the occasion their quality underwent the
prince's bitter sarcasm expressed to ramorny
sometimes by direct words oftener by bitter
gibes at length they were mounted and rode
on through the closing night and the falling
rain the prince leading the way with reckless
haste the glee maiden mounted by his express
order attended them and well for her
that accustomed to severe weather and exercise
both on foot and horseback she supported
as firmly as the men the fatigues the nocturnal
ride ramorny was compelled to keep at the
prince's rein being under no small anxiety lest
in his wayward fit he might ride off from him
entirely and taking refuge in the house 
some loyal baron escape the snare which was
spread for him he therefore suffered inexpressibly
during the ride both in mind and in
body
at length the forest falkland received
them and a glimpse the moon showed the
dark and huge tower an appendage royalty
itself though granted for a season to the duke
 albany on a signal given the drawbridge
fell torches glared in the courtyard menials
attended and the prince assisted from horseback
was ushered into an apartment where ramorn
waited on him together with dwining
and entreated him to take the leech's advice
the duke rothsay repulsed the proposal
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared and
having stood for some time shivering in his
dank garments beside a large blazing fire he
retired to his apartment without taking leave
 any one
you see the peevish humour this childish
boy now said ramorny to dwining eek europe wide from sea to sea
bat bonny bluecap still for me i
i've seen amain's proud champions prance
have seen the gallant knights france
unrivall'd with the sword and lance 
have seen the sons england true
wield the brown bill and bend the yew
search france the fair and england free
but bonny bluecap still for me 
in short though louise's disreputable occupation
would have been in other circumstances an
objection to catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company yet forced together as they now
were she found her a humble and accommodating
associate
they lived in this manner for four or five
days and in order to avoid as much as possible
the gaze and perhaps the incivility the menials
in the offices they prepared their food in
their own apartment in the absolutely necessary
intercourse with domestics louise more
accustomed to expedients bolder by habit and
desirous to please catharine willingly took on
herself the trouble getting from the panther
the materials their slender meal and arranging
it with the dexterity her country
the gleewoman had been abroad for this
purpose upon the sixth day a little before noon 
and the desire fresh air or the hope to find
some sallad or potherbs or at least an early
flower or two with which to deck their board
had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle she reentered her apartment
in the tower with a countenance pale as ashes
and a frame which trembled like an aspenleaf
her terror instantly extended itself to catharine
who could hardly find words to ask what new
misfortune had occurred
is the duke rothsay dead 
 worse they are starving him alive
madness woman 
no no no no said louise speaking under
her breath and huddling her words so thick
upon each other that catharine could hardly
catch the sense i was seeking for flowers to
dress your potage because you said you loved
them yesterday my poor little dog thrusting
himself into a thicket yew and holly bushes
that grow out some old ruins close to the
castlewall came back whining and howling 
i crept forward to see what might be the cause
and oh i heard a groaning as one in extreme
pain but so faint that it seemed to arise
t
out the very depth the earth at length
i found it proceeded from a small rent in the
wall covered with ivy and when i laid my ear
close to the opening i could hear the prince's
voice distinctly say it cannot now last long
and then it sunk away in something like a
prayer
gracious heaven did you speak to him
i said is it you my lord and the answer
was who mocks me with that name 
i asked him if i could help him and he answered
with a voice i shall never forget food 
food i die famine so i came hither to
tell you what is to be done shall we alarm
the house 
alas that were more likely to destroy than
to aid him said catharine
and what then shall we do said louise
i know not yet said catharine prompt
and bold on occasions moment though yielding
to her companion in ingenuity resource
on ordinary occasions i know not yet but
something we will do the blood bruce shall
not die unaided
so saying she seized the small cruise which
contained their soup and the meat which
it was made wrapped some thin cakes which
she had hated into the fold her plaid and
beckoning her companion to follow with a vessel
 milk also part their provisions she
hastened towards the garden
so oar fair vestal is stirring abroad said
the only man she met who was one the menials
 but catharine passed on without notice
or reply and gained the little garden without
farther interruption
louise indicated to her a heap ruins which
covered with underwood was close to the castlewall
it had probably been originally a projection
from the building and the small fissure
which communicated with the dungeon contrived
for air had terminated within it but the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay
and admitted a dim ray light to its recesses
although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torches
here is dead silence said catharine after
she had listened attentively for a moment 
 heaven and earth he is gone 
 we must risk something said her compact
ilion and ran her fingers over the strings her
guitar
a sigh was the only answer from the depth
 the dungeon catharine then ventured to
speak i am here my lord i am here with
food and drink
ha ramorny the jest comes too late
i am dying was the answer
his brain is turned and no wonder thought
catharine but whilst there is life there maybe
hope
it is i my lord catharine glover i have
food if i could pass it safely to you
 heaven bless thee i thought the pain was
over but it glows again within me at the name
 food
the food is here but how ah how can i
pass it to you the chink is so narrow the wallis
so thick yet there is a remedy i have it
quick louise cut me a willow bough the tallest
you can find
the gleemaiden obeyed and by means a
cleft in the top the wand catharine transmitted
several morsels the soft cakes soaked
in broth which served at once for food and fop
drink
the unfortunate young man ate little and
with difficulty but prayed for a thousand blessings
on the head his comforter i had destined
thee to be the slave my vices he said
and yet thou priest to become the preserver
 my life but away and save thyself
i will return with food as i shall see opportunity
said catharine just as the gleemaiden
plucked her sleeve and desired her to
be silent and stand close
both couched among the ruins and they
heard the voices ramorny and the physician
in close conversation
he is stronger than i thought said the former
in a low croaking tone how long held
out dalwolsey when the knight lauderdale
prisoned him in his castle hermitage 
for a fortnight answered dwining but
he was a strong man and had some assistance
by grain which fell from a granary above his
prisonhouse
were it not better the matter more
speedily the black douglas comes this way
t
he is not in albany's secret he will demand
to see the prince and all must be over ere he
comes
they passed on in their dark and fatal conversation

now gain we the tower said catharine to
her companion when she saw they had left the
garden i had a plan escape for myself 
i will turn it into one rescue for the prince
the deywoman enters the castle about vesper
time and usually leaves her cloak in the passage
as she goes into the panther's office with the
milk take thou the cloak muffle thyself close
and pass the warder boldly he is usually drunken
at that hour and thou wilt go as the deywoman
unchallenged through gate and along
bridge if thou bear thyself with confidence
then away to meet the black douglas he is
our nearest and only aid
but said louise is he not that terrible
lord who threatened me with shame and punishment

 believe it said catharine such as thou
or i never dwelt an hour in the douglas's memory
either for good or evil tell him that
his soninlaw the prince scotland dies 
treacherously famished in falkland castle
and thou wilt merit not pardon only but reward

i care not for reward said louise the
deed will reward itself but methinks to stay is
more dangerous than to go let me stay then
and nourish the unhappy prince and do you
depart to bring help if they kill me before you
return i leave you my poor lute and pray you
to be kind to my poor chariot
no louise replied catharine you are a
more privileged and experienced wanderer than
i do you go and if you find me dead on your
return as may well chance give my poor father
this ring and a lock my hair and say catharine
died in endeavouring to save the blood
 bruce and give this other lock to henry 
say catharine thought him to the last and
that if he has judged her too scrupulous touching
the blood others he will then know it
was not because she valued her own
they sobbed in each other's arms and the

intervening hours till evening were spent in endeavouring
to devise some better mode supplying
the captive with nourishment and in the
construction a tube composed hollow reeds
slipping into each other by which liquids might
be conveyed to him the bell the village
church falkland tolled to vespers the dey
or farmwoman entered with her pitchers to
deliver the milk for the family and to hear and
tell the news stirring she had scarcely entered
the kitchen when the female minstrel again
throwing herself in catharine's arms and assuring
her her unalterable fidelity crept in
silence down stairs the little dog under her
arm a moment after she was seen by the
breathless catharine wrapt in the dey woman's
cloak and walking composedly across the drawbridge

so said the warder you return early
tonight may bridget small mirth towards
in the hall ha wench sick times are sad
times 
hence perhaps dairywoman and dairy
i have forgotten my tallies said the readmitted
frenchwoman and will return in
the skimming a bowie
she went onward avoiding the village 
falkland and took a footpath which led through
the park catharine breathed freely and blessed
god when she saw her lost in the distance it
was another anxious hour for catharine which
occurred before the escape the fugitive was
discovered this happened so soon as the deygirl
having taken an hour to perform a task
which ten minutes might have accomplished
was about to return and discovered that someone
had taken away her grey frieze cloak a
strict search was set on foot at length the women
 the house remembered the gleemaiden
and ventured to suggest her as one not unlikely
to exchange an old cloak for a new one
the warder strictly questioned averred he saw
the deywoman depart immediately after vespers
 and on this being contradicted by the party
herself he could suggest as the only alternative
that it must needs have been the devil
as however the gleewoman could not be
vol iii p

found the real circumstances the case were
easily guessed at and the steward went to inform
sir john ramorny and dwining who
were now scarcely ever separate the escape 
one their female captives everything awakens
the suspicions the guilty they looked
on each other with faces dismay and then
went together to the humble apartment catharine
that they might take her as much as
possible by surprise while they inquired into
the facts attending louise's disappearance 
 where is your companion young woman
 said ramorny in a tone austere grar
city m
i have no companion here answered catharine

 trifle not replied the knight i mean
the gleemaiden who lately dwelt in this chamber
with you
 she is gone they tell me said catharine
gone about an hour since
and whither said dwining s
how answered catharine should i
know which way a professed wanderer may
choose to travel she was tired no doubt a
solitary life so different from the scenes 
feasting and dancing which her trade leads her
to frequent she is gone and the only wonder
is that she should have stayed so long
this then is all you have to tell us
all that i have to tell you sir john answered
catharine firmly and if the prince
himself inquire i can tell him no more
 there is little danger his again doing
you the honour to speak to you in person said
ramorny even if scotland should escape
being rendered miserable by the sad event 
his decease
 is the duke rothsay so very ill asked
catharine
 no help save in heaven answered ramorn
looking upward
then may there yet be help there said
catharine if human aid prove unavailing 
amen said ramorny with the most determined
gravity while dwining adopted a face
fit to echo the feeling though it seemed to cost
him a painful struggle to suppress his sneering
yet soft laugh triumph which was peculiarlyexcited
by anything having a religious tendency
and it bis men earthly men and not incarnate
devils who thus appeal to heaven while
they are devouring by inches the lifeblood 
their hapless master muttered catharine asher
two baffled inquisitors left the apartment 
why sleeps the thunder but it wih roll erelong
and oh may it be to preserve as well as
to punish 
the hour dinner alone afforded a space
when all in the castle being occupied with that
meal catharine thought she had the best opportunity
 venturing to the breach in the wall
with the least chance being observed in
waiting for the hour she observed some stir in
the castle which had been silent as the grave
ever since the seclusion the duke rothsay
the portcullis was lowered and raised and the
creaking the machinery was intermingled
with the tramp horse as menatarms went
out and returned with steeds hard ridden and
covered with foam she observed too that such
domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms all this made her heart throb
high for it augured the approach rescue and
besides the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever at length the hour noon
arrived she had taken care to provide under
pretence her own wishes which the panther
seemed disposed to indulge such articles 
food as could be the most easily conveyed to the
unhappy captive she whispered to intimate
her presence there was no answer she spoke
louder still there was silence
he sleeps she muttered these words half
aloud and with a shuddering which was succeeded
by a start and a scream when a voice
replied behind her 
yes he sleeps but it is for ever
she looked round sir john ramorny stood
behind her in complete armour but the visor
 his helmet was up and displayed a countenance
more resembling one about to die than
to fight he spoke with a grave tone something
between that a calm observer an interesting
event and one who is an agent and
partaker in it
catharine he said all is true which i
s
tell you he is dead you have done your best
for him you can do no more
i will not i cannot believe it said catharine
 heaven be merciful to me it would
make one doubt providence to think so great
a crime has been accomplished
 doubt not providence catharine though
it has suffered the profligate to fall by his own
devices follow me i have that to say which
concerns you i say follow for she hesitated
unless you prefer being left to the mercies 
the brute bonthron and the medicine henbane
dwining
i will follow you said catharine you
cannot do more to me than you are permitted
he led the way into the tower and mounted
staircase after staircase and ladder after ladder
catharine's resolution failed her i will
follow no farther she said whither would
you lead me if to my death i can die here
only to the battlements the castle fool
said ramorny throwing wide a barred door
which opened upon the vaulted roof the castle
where men were bending mangonels as they
called them military engines that is for throwing
arrows or stones getting ready crossbows
and piling stones together but the defenders
did not exceed twenty in number and catharine
thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them
catharine said ramorny i must not
quit this station which is necessary for my defence
 but i can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere
say on answered catharine i am prepared
to hear you
you have thrust yourself catharine into
a bloody secret have you the firmness to
keep it 
i do not understand you sir john answered
the maiden
look you i have slain murdered if you
will my late master the duke rothsay
the spark life which your kindness would
have fed was easily smothered his last words
called on his father you are faint bear up 
you have more to hear you know the crime
but you know not the provocation sec this
gauntlet is empty i lost my right hand in his
cause and when i was no longer fit to serve
him i was cast off like a wornout hound my
loss ridiculed and a cloister recommended instead
 the halls and palaces in which i had
my natural sphere think on this pity and
assist me
in what manner can you require my assistance
 said the trembling maiden i can neither
repair your loss nor cancel your crime
thou canst be silent catharine on what
thou hast seen and heard in yonder thicket it
is but a brief oblivion i ask you whose word
will i know be listened to whether you say
such things were or were not that your
mountebank companion the foreigner none will
hold to be a pinpoint's value if you grant
me this i will take your promise for my security
and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it if you will not promise silence i
defend this castle till every one perishes and i
fling you headlong from these battlements ay
look at them it is not a leap to be rashly braved
seven courses stairs brought you up
hither with fatigue and shortened breath but
you shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer
time than you can breathe a sigh speak the
word fair maid for you speak to one unwilling
to harm you but determined in his purpose
catharine stood terrified and without power
 answering a man who seemed so desperate 
but she was saved the necessity reply by the
approach d wining he spoke with the same
humble cones which at all times distinguished
his manner and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer which gave that manner the lie
i do you wrong noble sir to intrude on
your valiancy when engaged with a fair damsel
but i come to ask a trifling question
speak tormentor said ramorny ill
news are sport to thee even when they affect
thyself so that they concern others also
hem he he i only desired to know if
your knighthood proposed the chivalrous task
 defending the castle with your single hand
i crave pardon i meant your single arm
the question is worth asking for i am good for
little to aid the defence unless you could prevail

oil the besiegers to take physic he he he 
and bonthron is as drunk as ale and strong
waters can make him and you he and i makeup
the whole garrison who are disposed for resistance

 how will the other dogs not fight
said ramorny
never saw men who showed less stomach
to the work answered dwining never but
here come a brace them venit extrema dies
he he he f
eviot and his companion b uncle now approached
with sullen resolution in their faces
like men who had made their minds up to deny
that authority which they had so long obeyed
how now said ramorny stepping forward
to meet them wherefore from your
posts why have you left the barbican eliot
 and you other fellow did i not charge
you to look to the mangonels 
we have something to tell you sir john
ramorny answered eviot we will not fight
in this quarrel
how my own squires control me said
ramorny
we were your squires and pages my lord
while you were master the duke rothsay's
household it is bruited about the duke
no longer lives we desire to know the truth
what traitor dares spread such falsehoods
said ramorny
all who have gone out to skirt the forest
my lord and i myself among others bring back
the same news the minstrel woman who left
the castle yesterday has spread the report everywhere
that the duke rothsay is murdered
or at death's door the douglas comes on us
with a strong force 
and you cowards take advantage an idle
report to forsake your master said ramorny
indignantly
 my lord said eviot let buncle and
myself see the duke rothsay and receive
his personal orders and if we do not fight to
the death in defence the castle i will consent
to be hanged on its highest turret but if hebe
gone by natural disease we will yield up the
castle to the earl douglas who is they say
the king's lieutenant or if which heaven
forefend the noble prince has had foul play
we will not involve ourselves in the guilt 
using arms in defence the murderers be they
who they will i
 eviot said ramorny raising his mutilated
arm had not that glove been empty thou
hadst not lived to utter two words this insolence

it is as it is answered eviot and we
do but our duty i have followed you long my
lord but here i draw bridle ot
farewell then and a curse light on all 
you exclaimed the incensed baron let my
horse be brought forth 
our valiancy is about to run away said
the medicine who had crept close to catharine's
side before she was aware catharine
thou art a superstitious fool like most women 
nevertheless thou hast some mind and i speak
to thee as one more understanding than the
buffaloes which are herding about us these
haughty barons who overstrained the world what
are they in the day adversity chaff before
the wind let their sledgehammer hands or
their column resembling legs have injury and
bah the menatarms are gone heart and
courage is nothing to them lithe and limb everything
 give them animal strength what are they
better than furious bulls take that away and
your hero chivalry lies grovelling like the
brute when he is hamstrung not so the sage 
while a grain sense remains in a crushed or
mutilated frame his mind shall be strong as
ever catharine this morning i was practising
your death but methinks i now rejoice that
you may survive to tell how the poor medicine
the pillgilder the mortarpounder the poisonvender
met his fate in company with the gallant
knight ramorny baron in possession and
earl lindores in expectation god save his
lordship 
old man said catharine if thou be indeed
so near the day thy deserved doom
other thoughts were far wholesome than the
vainglorious ravings a vain philosophy 
ask to see a holy man 
yes said dwining scornfully refer myself
to a greasy monk who does not he he 
ibs
he understand the barbarous latin he repeats
by rote such would be a fitting counsellor to one
who has studied both in spain and arabia no
catharine i will choose a confessor that is pleasant
to look upon and you shall be honoured
with the office now look yonder at his valiancy
 his eyebrow drops with moisture his
lip trembles with agony for his valiancy he 
he he is pleading for his life with his late
domestics and has not eloquence enough to
persuade them to let him slip see how the
fibres his face work as he implores the ungrateful
brutes whom he has heaped with obligations
to permit him to get such a start for his
life as the hare has from the greyhounds when
men course her fairly look also at the sullen
downcast dogged faces with which fluctuating
between fear and shame the domestic traitors
deny their lord this poor chance for his life these
things thought themselves the superior a manlike
me and you foolish wench think so meanly
 your deity as to suppose wretches like
them are the work omnipotence 
 no man evil no said catharine
warmly the god i worship created these men
with the attributes to know and adore him to
guard and defend their fellowcreatures to practise
holiness and virtue their own vices and
the temptations their one have made them
such as they now are oh take the lesson home
to thine own heart adamant heaven made
thee wiser than thy fellows gave thee eyes to
look into the secrets nature a sagacious heart
and a skilful hand but thy pride has poisoned
all these fair gifts and made an ungodly atheist
 one who might have been a christian sage 
atheist say'st thou answered dwining
perhaps i have doubts on that matter but
they will be soon solved yonder comes one
who will send me as he has done thousands to
the place where all mysteries shall be cleared
catharine followed the medicine's eye up one
 the forest glades and beheld it occupied by a
body horsemen advancing at full gallop in
the midst was a pennon displayed which though
its bearings were not visible to catharine was
by a murmur around acknowledged as that 
the black douglas they halted within arrowshot
 the castle and a herald with two trumpets
advanced up to the main portal whereafter
a loud flourish he demanded admittance
for the high and dreaded archibald earl 
douglas lord lieutenant the king and acting
for the time with the plenary authority 
his majesty commanding at the same time
that the inmates the castle should lay down
their arms all under penalty high treason
you hear said eviot to ramorny who
stood sullen and undecided will you give
orders to render the castle or must i 
no villain interrupted the knight to
the last i will command you open the gates
drop the bridge and render the castle to the
douglas
now that's what may be called a gallant
exertion free will said d wining just
as if the pieces brass that were screaming a
minute since should pretend to call those notes
their own which are breathed through them by
a frowsy trumpeter
wretched man said catharine either
be silent or turn thy thoughts to the eternity
on the brink which thou art standing
and what is that to thee answered dining
 thou canst not wench help hearing
what i say to thee and thou wilt tell it again
for thy sex cannot help that either perth and
all scotland shall know what a man they have
lost in henbane dwining 
the clash armour now announced that the
new comers had dismounted and entered the
castle and were in the act disarming the
small garrison earl douglas himself appeared
on the battlements with a few his followers
and signed to them to take ramorny and dining
into custody others dragged from some
nook the stupefied bonthron
it was to these three that the custody 
the prince was solely committed during his
alleged illness said the douglas prosecuting
an inquiry which he had commenced in the
hall the castle
no other saw him said eviot though
i offered my services
conduct us to the duke's apartment and
bring the prisoners with us also there should
be a female in the castle if she hath not been
vol iii j
murdered or spirited away the companion 
the gleemaiden who brought the first alarm
she is here my lord said eviot bringing
catharine forward
her beauty and her agitation made some impression
even upon the impassible earl
 fear nothing maiden he said thou
hast deserved both praise and reward tell tome
as thou would'st confess to heaven the
things thou hast witnessed in this castle
few words served catharine to unfold the
dreadful story
it agrees said the douglas with the
tale the gleemaiden from point to point 
now show us the prince's apartment
they passed to the room which the unhappy
duke rothsay had been supposed to inhabit 
but the key was not to be found and the earl
could only obtain entrance by forcing the door
on entering the wasted and squalid remains 
the unhappy prince were discovered flung on
the bed as if in haste the intention the
murderers had apparently been to arrange the
dead body so as to resemble a timely parted
corpse but they had been disconcerted by the
alarm occasioned by the escape louise douglas
looked on the body the misguided youth
whose wild passions and caprice's had brought
him to this fatal and premature catastrophe
i had wrongs to be redressed he said 
but to see such a sight as this banishes all
remembrance injury 
he he it should have been arranged
said d wining more to your omnipotence's
pleasure but you came suddenly on us and
hasty masters make slovenly service
douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner
said so closely did he examine the wan and
wasted features and stiffened limbs the
dead body before him catharine overcome
by sickness and fainting at length obtained
permission to retire from the dreadful scene
and through confusion every description
found her way to her former apartment where
she was locked in the arms louise who had
returned in the interval
the investigations douglas proceededthe
dying hand the prince was found to be
clenched upon a lock hair resembling in coil

lour and texture the coalblack bristles bonthrone
thus though famine had begun the
work it would seem that rothsay's death had
been finally accomplished by violence the
private stair to the dungeon the keys which
were found at the subaltern assassin's belt the
situation the vault its communication with
the external air by the fissure in the walls and
the wretched lair straw with the fetters
which remained there fully confirmed the
story catharine and the glee woman
we will not hesitate an instant said the
douglas to his near kinsman the lordbalveny
as soon as they returned from the dungeon
away with the murderers hang them over
the battlements
but my lord some trial may be fitting
answered balcony
to what purpose answered douglas i
have taken them redhand my authority will
stretch to instant execution yet stay have
we not some redwood men in our troop 
plenty turnbulls rutherford aisles
and so forth said balcony
call me an inquest these together they
are all good men and true saving a little shifting
for their living do thou see to the execution
 these felons while i hold a court in the
great hall and we'll try whether the jury or the
provostmarshal do their work first we will
have jed wood justice hang in haste and try
at leisure
yet stay my lord said ramorny you
may rue your haste will you grant me a word
out earshot 
not for worlds said douglas speak
out what thou hast to say before all that are
here present
know all then said ramorny aloud that
this noble earl had letters from the duke 
albany and myself sent him by the hand 
yon cowardly deserter buncle let him deny
it if he dare counselling the removal the
duke for a space from court and his seclusion
in this castle falkland
but not a word replied douglas sternly
smiling his being flung into a dungeon 
famished strangled away with the wretches
balveny they pollute god's air too long 
the prisoners were dragged off to the battlements
but while the means execution were
in the act being prepared the apothecary
expressed so ardent a desire to see catharine
once more and as he said for the good his
soul that the maiden in hopes his obduracy
might have undergone some change even at
the last hour consented again to go to the
battlements and face a scene which her heart
recoiled from a single glance showed her
bonthron sunk in total and drunken insensibility
ramorny stripped his armour endeavouring
in vain to conceal fear while he
spoke with a priest whose good offices he had
solicited and dwining the same humble 
crouching individual she had
always known him he held in his hand a little
silver pen with which he had been writing on
a scrap parchment
catharine he said he he he j wish
to speak to thee on the nature my religious
faith
if such be thy intention why lose time
with me speak with this good father
the good father said dvviuiug is he
he already a worshipper the deity whom
i have served i therefore prefer to give the
altar mine idol a new worshipper in thee catharine
this scrap parchment will tell thee
how to make your way into my chapel where
i have worshipped so often in safety i leave
the images which it contains to thee as a legacy
simply because i hate and contemn thee something
less than any the absurd wretches
whom i have hitherto been obliged to call fellowcreatures
and now away or remain and
see if the the quacksalver belies his life
our lady forbid said catharine
nay said the medicine i have but a
single word to say and yonder nobleman's valiancy
may hear it if he will
lord balveny approached with some curiosity
for the undaunted resolution a man who
never wielded sword or bore armour and was
in person a poor dwindled dwarf had to him an
air something resembling sorcery
you see this trifling implement said the
criminal showing the silver pen by means
 this i can escape the power even the black
douglas aiiiii mm
give him no ink nor paper said balveny
hastily he will draw a spell
not so please your wisdom and valiancy
he he he said dwining with his usual
chuckle as he unscrewed the top the pen
within which was a piece sponge or some such
substance no bigger than a pea now mark
this said the prisoner and drew it between
his lips the effect was instantaneous he lay
a dead corpse before them the contemptuous
sneer still on his countenance
catharine shrieked and fled seeking by a
hasty descent an escape from a sight so appalling
lord balveny was for a moment stupefied
and then exclaimed this may be glamour
 hang him over the battlements quick or
dead if his foul spirit hath only withdrawn
for a space it shall return to a body with a
dislocated neck
his commands were obeyed ramorny and
bonthron were then ordered for execution the
last was hanged before he seemed quite to come

pretend what was designed to be done with
him ramorny pale as death yet with the
same spirit pride which had occasioned his
ruin pled his knighthood and demanded the
privilege dying by the sword and not by the
noose ad d sad
 the douglas never alters his doom said
balveny but thou shalt have all thy rights 
send the cook hither with a cleaver the menial
whom he called appeared at his summons
what shakes thou for fellow said balcony
 here strike me this man's gilt spurs from
his heels with thy cleaver and now john
ramorny thou art no longer a knight but a
knave to the halter with him provostmarshal
 hang him betwixt his companions and
higher than them if it may be
in a quarter an hour afterwards balveny
descended to tell the douglas that the criminals
were executed
then there is no further use in the trial
said the earl how say you good men 
inquest were these men guilty high treason 
ay or no 
guilty exclaimed the obsequious inquest
with edifying unanimity we need no farther
evidence
sound trumpets and to horse then with
our own train only and let each man keep silence
on what has chanced here until the proceedings
shall be laid before the king which
cannot conveniently be till the battle palm
sunday shall be fought and ended select our
attendants and tell each man who either goes
with us or remains behind that he who prates
dies
in a few minutes the douglas was on horseback
with the followers selected to attend his
person expresses were sent to his daughter
the widowed duchess rothsay directing her
to take her course to perth by the shores 
lochleven without approaching falkland and
committing to her charge catharine glover and
the gleewoman as persons whose safety he
tendered
as they rode through the forest they looked
back and beheld the three bodies hanging like
specks darkening the walls the old castle
the band is punished said douglas but
who shall arraign the head by whose direction
the act was done 
you mean the duke albany said balvery

i do kinsman and were i to listen to the
dictates my heart i would charge him with
the deed which i am certain he has authorized
but there is no proof it beyond strong suspicion
and albany has attached to himself the
numerous friends the house stewart to
whom indeed the imbecility the king and
the ill regulated habits rothsay left no other
choice a leader were i therefore to break
the band which i have so lately formed with albany
the consequence must be civil war an
event ruinous to poor scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity the percy
backed by the treachery march no balveny
the punishment albany must rest with
heaven which in its own good time will execute
judgment on him and on his house
chapter x
we are now to recall to our reader's recollection
that simon glover and his fair daughter
had been hurried from their residence without
having time to announce to henry smith
either their departure or the alarming cause 
it when therefore the lover appeared in curfew
street on the morning their flight instead
 the hearty welcome the honest burgher
and the april reception half joy half censure
which he had been promised on the part
 his lovely daughter he received only the astounding
intelligence that her father and she
had set off early on the summons a stranger
who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation to this dorothy whose talents for
forestalling evil and communicating her views
 it are known to the reader chose to add that
she had no doubt her master and young mistress
were bound for the highlands to avoid a
visit which had been made since their departure
by two or three apparitors who in the name 
a commission appointed by the king had
searched the house put seals upon such places
as were supposed to contain papers and left
citations for father and daughter to appear before
the court commission on a day certain under
pain outlawry all these alarming particulars
dorothy took care to state in the gloomiest
colours and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was that her master
had charged her to tell him to reside quietly at
perth and that he should soon hear news 
them this checked the smith's first resolve
which was to follow them instantly to the
highlands and partake the fate which they
might encounter
but when he recollected his repeated feuds
with divers the clan quhele and particularly
his personal quarrel with conachar who was
now raised to he a high chief he could not but
think on reflection that his intrusion on their
place retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy
there than be any service to them he was
well acquainted with simon's habitual intimacy
with the chief the clan quhele and justly
augured that the glover would obtain protection
which his own arrival might be likely
to disturb while his personal prowess could
little avail him in a quarrel with a whole tribe
 vindictive mountaineers at the same time
his heart throbbed with indignation when he
thought catharine being within the absolute
power young conachar whose rivalry
he could not doubt and who had now so many
means urging his suit what if the young
chief should make the safety the father depend
on the favour the daughter he distrusted
not catharine's affections but then
leer mode thinking was so disinterested and
her affection to her father so tender that if the
love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security or perhaps his life it was matter 
deep and awful doubt whether it might not be
found light in the balance tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell he resolved
nevertheless to remain at home stifle his
anxiety as he might and await the promised intelligence
from the old man it came but it
did not relieve his concern
sir patrick charteris had not forgotten his
promise to communicate to the smith the plans
 the fugitives but amid the bustle occasioned
by the movement troops he could
not himself convey the intelligence he therefore
intrusted to his agent kitt henshaw the
task making it known but this worthy
person as the reader knows was in the interest
 raraorny whose business it was to conceal
from every one but especially from a lover
so active and daring as henry the real place
 catharine's residence henshaw therefore announced
to the anxious smith that his friend the
glover was secure in the highlands and though
he affected to be more reserved on the subject
 catharine he said little to contradict the belief
that she as well as simon shared the protection
 the clan quhele but he reiterated
in the name sir patrick assurances that
father and daughter were both well and that
henry would best consult his own interest and
their safety by remaining quiet and waiting
the course events
with an agonized heart therefore henry
gow determined to remain quiet till he had
more certain intelligence and employed himself
in finishing a shirt mail which he intended
should be the best tempered and the most finely
polished that his skilful hands had ever executed
this exercise his craft pleased him better
than any other occupation which he could have
adopted and served as an apology for secluding
himself in his workshop and shunning society
where the idle reports which were daily circulated
served only to perplex and disturb him
he resolved to trust in the warm regard simon
the faith his daughter and the friends
hip the provost who having so highly commended
his valour in the combat with bonthrow
would never he thought desert him at
this extremity his fortunes time however
passed on day by day and it was not till
palm sunday was near approaching that sir
patrick charteris having entered the city to
make some arrangements for the ensuing combat
bethought himself making a visit to the
smith the wynd
he entered his workshop with an air sympathy
unusual to him and which made henry
instantly augur that he brought bad news
the smith caught the alarm and the uplifted
hammer was arrested in its descent upon the
heated iron while the agitated arm that wielded
it strong before as that a giant became
so powerless that it was with difficulty henry
was able to place the weapon on the ground
instead dropping it from his hand
my poor henry said sir patrick i
bring you but cold news they are uncertain
however and if true they are such as a brave
man like you should not take too deeply to
heart
vol iii r
in god's name my lord said henry i
trust you bring no evil news simon glover
or his daughter 
touching themselves said sir patrick
no they are safe and well but as to thee
henry my tidings are more cold kitt henshaw
has i think apprised thee that i had endeavoured
to provide catharine glover with a
safe protection in the house an honourable
lady the duchess rothsay but she hath
declined the charge and catharine hath been
sent to her father in the highlands what is
worst is to come thou mayest have heard that
gilchrist maclan is dead and that his son
eachin who was known in perth as the apprentice
 old simon by the name conachar
is now the chief clan quhelp and i heard
from one my domestics that there is a strong
rumour among the maclean that the young
chief seeks the hand catharine in marriage
my domestic learned this as a secret however
while in the breadalbane country on some arrangements
touching the ensuing combat the
thing is uncertain but henry it wears a face
 likelihood
 did your lordship's servant see simon
glover and his daughter said henry struggling
for breath and coughing to conceal from
the provost the excess his agitation
he did not said sir patrick the highlanders
seemed jealous and refused to permit
him to speak to the old man and he feared to
alarm them by asking to see catharine besides
he talks no gaelic nor had his informer much
english so there may be some mistake in the
matter nevertheless there is such a report and
i thought it best to tell it you but you maybe
well assured that the wedding cannot goon
till the affair palm sunday be over and
i advise you to take no step till we learn the
circumstances the matter for certainty is
most desirable even when it is a painful one
go you to the councilhouses he added after
a pause to speak about the preparations for
the lists in the north inch you will be welcome
there
no my good lord
well smith i judge by your brief answer
that you are discomposed with this matter
but after all women are weathercocks
that is the truth on't solomon and others have
proved it before you
and so sir patrick charteris retired fully
convinced he had discharged the office a comforter
in the most satisfactory manner
 with very different impressions did the unfortunate
lover regard the tidings and listen to
the consoling commentary
the provost he said bitterly to himself
 is an excellent man marry he holds his
knighthood so high that if he speaks nonsense
a poor man must hold it sense as he must praise
dead ale if it be handed to him in his lordship's
silver flaggon how would all this sound in
another situation suppose i were rolling down
the steep descent the corrichie diu and before
i came to the edge the rock comes my
lord provost and cries henry there is a deep
precipice and i grieve to say you are in the fairway
 rolling over it but be not downcast
for heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop
your progress however i thought it would be
comfort to you to know the worst which you

will be presently aware i do not know how
many hundred feet deep the precipice descends
but you may form a judgment when you are at
the bottom for certainty is certainty and harkye
when come you to take a game at bowls 
and this gossip is to serve instead any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck when
i think this i could go mad seize my hammer
and break and destroy all around me but
i will be calm and if this highland kite who
calls himself a falcon should stoop at my turtledove
he shall know whether a burgess perth
can draw a bow or not
it was now the thursday before the fated
palm sunday and the champions on either side
were expected to arrive the next day that they
might have the interval saturday to rest refresh
themselves and prepare for the combat
two or three each the contending parties
were detached to receive directions about the
encampment their little band and such other
instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering the field henry was not therefore
surprised at seeing a tall and powerful
i
highlander peering anxiously about the wynd
in which he lived in the manner in which the
natives a wild country examine the curiosities
 one that is more civilized the smith's
heart rose against the man on account his
country to which our perth burgher bore a natural
prejudice and more especially as he observed
the individual wear the plaid peculiar to
the clan quhele the sprig oakleaves worked
in silk intimated also that the individual
was one those personal guards young
eachin upon whose exertions in the future
battle so much reliance was placed
having observed so much henry withdrew
into his smithy for the sight the man raised
his passion and knowing that the highlander
came plighted to a solemn combat and could
not be the subject any inferior quarrel he
was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him in a few minutes however
the door the smithy flew open and fluttering
in his tartans which greatly magnified his
actual size the gael entered with the haughty
step a man conscious a personal dignity
superior to anything which he is likely to meet
with he stood looking around him and seemed
to expect to he received with courtesy and
regarded with wonder but henry had no sort
 inclination to indulge his vanity and kept
hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware 
his visitor's presence
you are the gow chrom f the bandjleg
get smith said the highlander 
those that wish to be crookbacked call me
so answered henry
no offence meant said the highlander 
but her own self comes to buy an armour
her own self's bare shanks may trot hence
with her answered henry i have none to
sell
if it was not within two days palm sunday
herself would make you sing another songs
retorted the gael
 and being the day it is said henry with
the same contemptuous indifference i pray
you to stand out my light
you are an uncivil person but her own
self is jr nan ord too and she knows the smith
is fiery when the iron is hot
 if her iiaiusell be hammermau herself
her nainsell may make her nain harness replied
henry
and so her nainsell would and never fash
you for the matter hut it is said gow chron
that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords
and varnishes that you work that have power
to make the blades cut steellinks as if they
were paper and the plate and mail turn back
steellances as if they were toddleprins 
they tell your ignorance any nonsense that
christian men refuse to believe said henry
i whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost
like an honest craftsman and commonly
it is the highlandman's och hone for 
 my hammer goes naturally to that
tune
friend it is but idle to spur a horse when
his legs are unshackled said the highlander
haughtily her own self cannot fight even
now and there is little gallantry in taunting her
thus
by nails and hammer you are right there
said the smith altering his tone but speak

oat at once friend what is it thou would'st have
 me i am in no humour for dallying
a hauberk for her chief eachin mac ian
said the highlander
you are a hamnierman you say are you
a judge this said our smith producing from
a chest the mail shirt on which he had been
lately employed
the gael handled it with a degree admiration
which had something envy in it he
looked curiously at every part its texture and
at length declared it the very best piece armour
that he had seen
a hundred cows and bullocks and a good
drift sheep would be e'en over cheap an offer
said the highlandman by way tentative
 but her nainsell will never bid thee less
come by them how she can
it is a fair proffer replied henry but
gold nor gear will never buy that harness i
want to try my own sword on my own armour 
and i will not give that mailcoat to any one
but who will face me for the best three blows
and a thrust in the fair field and it is your
chief's upon these terms

hut prut man take a drink and go to
bed said the highlander in great scorn are
ye mad think ye the captain the clan
quhele will be brawling and battling with a bit
perth burgess body like you whisht man
and hearken her nainsell will do ye mair credit
than ever belonged to your kin she will fight
you for the fair harness herself
she must first show that she is my match
said henry with a grim smile
how i one eachin's leichtach and
not your match 
you may try me if you will you say you
are a fir nan ord do you know how to cast a
sledgehammer 
ay truly ask the eagle if he can fly over
arragon
but before you strive with me you must
first try a cast with one mi leichtach here
dunter stand forth for the honour perth 
and now highlandman there stands a row 
hammers choose which you will and let us to
the garden
the highlander whose name was norman
nan ord or norman the hammer showed
his title to the epithet by selecting the largest
hammer the set at which henry smiled hunter
the stout journeyman the smith made
what was called a prodigious cast hut the highlander
making a desperate effort threw beyond
it by two or three feet and looked with an air
 triumph to henry who again smiled in reply
will you mend that said the gael offering
our smith the hammer
not with that child's toy said henry
which has scarce weight to fly against the
wind janniken fetch me sampson or one
 you help the boy for sampson is somewhat
ponderous
the hammer now produced was half as heavy
again as that which the highlander had selected
as one unusual weight norman stood astonished
 but he was still more so when henry
taking his position swung the ponderous implement
far behind his right haunch joint and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown
from a warlike engine the air groaned and
whistled as the mass flew through it down at
length it came and the iron head sunk a foot
into the earth a full yard beyond the cast 
norman
the highlander defeated and mortified went
to the spot where the weapon lay lifted it poised
it in his hand with great wonder and examined
it closely as if he expected to discover
more in it than a common hammer he at
length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile shrugging his shoulders and shaking
his head as the smith asked him whether
he would not mend his cast
 norman has lost too much at the sport already
he replied she has lost her own
name the hammered but does her oneself
the gow chron work at the anvil with that
horse's load iron 
you shall see brother said henry leading
the way to the smithy dunter he said
rax me that bar from the furnace and uplifting
sampson as he called the monstrous
hammer he plied the metal with a hundred
strokes from right to left now with the right
hand now with the left now with both with
so much strength at once and dexterity that he
worked off a small but beautifully proportioned
horseslide in half the time that an ordinary
smith would have taken for the same purpose
with a more manageable implement
 high high said the highlander and
what for would you be fighting with our young
chief who is far above your standard though
you were the best smith ever wrought with wind
and fire 
hark you said henry you seem a
good fellow and i'll tell you the truth your
master has wronged me and i give him this
harness freely for the chance fighting him
myself
nay if he hath wronged you he must meet
you said the lifeguardsman to do a man
wrong takes the eagle's feather out the chiefs
bonnet and were he the first in the highlands
and to be sure so is eachin he must fight the
man he has wronged or else a rose falls from
his chaplet
will you move him to this said henry
after the fight on sunday 
oh her nainsellwill do her best if the hawks
have not got her bones to pick for you must
know brother that clan chattan's claws pierce
rather deep
 the armour is your chief's on that condition
said henry but i will disgrace him
before king and court if he does not pay me
the price
deil a fear deil a fear i will bring him into
the barrack myself said norman assuredly

 you will do me a pleasure replied henry
and that you may remember your promise i
will bestow on you this dirk look if you hold
it truly and can strike between the mailhood
and the collar your enemy the surgeon will
be needless
the highlander was lavish in his expressions
 gratitude and took his leave
i have given him the best mail harness i
ever wrought said the smith to himself rather
repenting his liberality for the poor
chance that he will bring his chief into a fairfield
with me and then let catharine be his
who can win her fairly but much i dread the
youth will find some evasion unless he have
such luck on palm sunday as may induce him
to try another combat that is some hope however
 for i have often ere now seen a raw
young fellow shoot up after his first fight from
a dwarf into a giantqueller
thus with little hope but with the most determined
resolution henry smith awaited the
time that should decide his fate what made
him augur the worst was the silence both the
glover and his daughter they are ashamed
he said to confess the truth to me and therefore
they are silent
upon the friday at noon the two bands representing
the contending clans arrived at the
several points where they were to halt for refreshments

the clan quhele was entertained hospitably
at the rich abbey scone while the provost
regaled their rivals at his castle kinfauns 
the utmost care being taken to treat both parties
with the most punctilious attention and to
afford neither an opportunity complaining
 partiality all points etiquette were in
the meanwhile discussed and settled by the
lord high constable errol and the young
earl crawford the former acting on the
part the clan chattan and the latter patronising
the clan quhele messengers were passing
continually from the one earl to the other
and they held more than six meetings within
thirty hours before the ceremonial the field
could be exactly arranged
meanwhile in case revival ancient quarrel
many seeds which existed betwixt the
burghers and their mountain neighbours a proclamation
commanded the citizens not to approach
within half a mile the place where
the highlanders were quartered while on their
part the intended combatants were prohibited
from approaching perth without special license
troops were stationed to enforce this order
who did their charge so scrupulously as to prevent
simon glover himself burgess and citizen
 perth from approaching the town because
he owned having come thither at the same time
with the champions eachin maclan and wore
a plaid around him their check or pattern
this interruption prevented simon from seeking
out henry wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge all that had happened since
their separation which intercourse had it taken
place must have materially altered the catastrophe
 our narrative
on saturday afternoon another arrival took
place which interested the city almost as much
as the preparations for the expected combat
this was the approach the earl douglas who
rode through the town with a troop only thirty
horse but all whom were knights and gentlemen
 the first consequence men's eyes followed
this dreaded peer as they pursue the flight
 an eagle through the clouds unable to ken the
course the bird jove yet silent attentive
and as earnest in observing him as if they could
guess the object for which he sweeps through
the firmament he rode slowly through the
city and passed out at the northern gate he
next alighted at the dominican convent and
desired to see the duke albany the earl
was introduced instantly and received by the
duke with a manner which was meant to be
graceful and conciliatory but which could not
conceal both art and inquietude when the
first greetings were over the earl said with
great gravity i bring you melancholy news
vol iii s
your grace's royal nephew the duke rothsay
is no more and i fear hath perished by some
foul practices
 practices said the duke in confusion
 what practice who dared practise on the
heir the scottish throne 
 tis not for me to state how these doubts
arise said douglas but men say the eagle
was killed with an arrow fledged from his own
wing and the oak trunk rent by a wedge the
same wood fiiioactib
earl douglas said the duke albany
i am no reader riddles
nor am i a propounder them said douglas
haughtily your grace will find particulars
in these papers worthy perusal i
will go for half an hour to the cloister garden
and then rejoin you
you go not to the king my lord said
albany
no answered douglas i trust your
grace will agree with me that we should conceal
this great family misfortune from our sovereign
till the business tomorrow be decided
iiiifo
i willingly agree said albany if the
king heard this loss he could not witness
the combat and if he appear not in person
these men are likely to refuse to fight and the
whole work is cast loose but i pray you sit
down my lord while i read these melancholy
papers respecting poor rothsay
he passed the papers through his hands turning
some over with a hasty glance and dwelling
on others as if their contents had been the last
importance when he had spent nearly a quarter
 an hour in this manner he raised his eyes
and said very gravely my lord in these most
melancholy documents it is yet a comfort to see
nothing which can renew the divisions in the
king's councils which were settled by the last
solemn agreement between your lordship and
myself my unhappy nephew was by that agreement
to be set aside until time should send him
a graver judgment he is now removed by
fate and our purpose in that matter is anticipated
and rendered unnecessary
if your grace replied the earl sees nothing
to disturb the good understanding which
the tranquillity and safety scotland require
should exist between us i am not so ill a friend
 my country as to look closely for such
y a special friend and adviser met in the midst
 the lists having to assist them in determining
what was to be done the earl marshal the
lord high constable the earl crawford
and sir patrick charteris the chief the
clan chattan declared himself willing and desirous
 fighting upon the spot without regard
to the disparity numbers
that said torquil the oak clan
quhele will never consent to you can never
win honour from us with the sword and you
seek but a subterfuge that you may say when
you are defeated as you know you will be that
it was for want the number your band
fully counted out but i make a proposal 
vol iii t
ferqnhard day was the youngest your band
eachin maclan is the youngest ours we
will set him aside in place the man who has
fled from the combat
a most unjust and unequal proposal exclaimed
toshach beg the second as he might
be termed macgillie chattanaeh the life
 the chief is to the clan the breath our
nostrils nor will we ever consent that our chief
shall be exposed to dangers which the captain
 clan quliele does not share
torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan
was about to fail when the objection was made
to hector's being withdrawn from the battle 
and he was meditating how to support his proposal
when eachin himself interfered his
timidity it must be observed was not that
sordid and selfish nature which induces those
who are infected by it calmly to submit to dishonour
rather than risk clanger on the contrary
he was morally brave though constitutionally
timid and the shame avoiding the
combat became at the moment more powerful
than the fear facing it
i will not hear he said a scheme
which will leave my sword sheathed during
this day's glorious combat if i am yoking in
arms there are enough brave men around
me whom i may imitate if i cannot equal
he spoke these words in a spirit which imposed
on torqui and perhaps on the young
chief himself
now god bless his noble heart said the
fosterfather to himself i was sure the foul
spell would be broken through and that the
tardy spirit which besieged him would fly at
the sound the pipe and the first flutter 
the attach 
hear me lord marshal said the constable
 the hour combat may not be much
longer postponed for the day approaches to high
noon let the chief clan chattan take the
half hour which remains to find if he can a
substitute for this deserter if he cannot let
them fight as they stand
content i am said the marshal though
as none his own clan are nearer than fifty
miles i see not how macgillie cbattanach is to
find an auxiliary
that is his business said the high constable
 but if he offers a high reward there
are enough stout yeomen surrounding the
lists who will be glad enough to stretch their
limbs in such a game as is expected i myself
did my quality and charge permit would blithely
take a turn work amongst these wild fellows
and think it fame won
they communicated their decision to the
highlanders and the chief the clan chateau
replied you have judged impartially
and nobly my lords and i deem myself obliged
to follow your direction so make proclamation
heralds that if any one will take his
share with clan batten the honours and
chances this day he shall have present payment
 a gold crown and liberty to fight to
the death in nfy ranks
you are something chary your treasure
chief said the earl marshal a gold crown
is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you
 if there be any man willing to fight for
honour replied macgillie chattanach the
price will be enough and i want not the service
 a fellow who draws his sword for gold alone
the heralds had made their progress moving
half way round the lists stopping from time to
time to make proclamation as they had been
directed without the least apparent disposition
on the part any one to accept the proffered
enlistment some sneered at the poverty
 the highlanders who set so mean a price
upon such a desperate service others affected
resentment that they should esteem the bltod
 citizens so lightly none showed the slightest
intention to undertake the task proposed until
the sound the proclamation reached henry
 the wynd as he stood without the barrier
speaking from time to time with bailie craigdal
lie or rather listening vaguely to what the magistrate
was saying to him
 ha what proclaim they he cried out
a liberal offer on the part macgillie
chattanach said the host the griffin who
proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn
wild cat for the day and be killed a little in his
service that's all
how exclaimed the smith eagerly do
they make proclamation for a man to fight
against the clan quhele 
ay marry do they said griffin but i
think they will find no such fools in perth
he had hardly said th'te word when he beheld
the smith clear the barriers at a single bound
and alight in the lists saying here am i sir
herald henry the wynd willing to do battle
with the clan quhele
a cry admiration ran through the multitude
while the grave burghers not being able
to conceive the slightest reason for henry's behaviour
concluded that his head must be absolutely
turned with the love fighting the
provost was especially shocked
 thou art mad he said henry thou
hast neither twohanded sword nor shirt 
mail
truly no said henry for i parted with
a mailshirt which i had made for myself to
yonder gay chief the clan quhele who will
soon find on bis shoulders with what sort 
blows i clink my rivets as for twohanded
sword why this boy's brand will serve my turn
till i can master a heavier one
this must not be said errol hark
thee armourer by saint diary thou shalt have
my milan hauberk and good spanish sword
i thank your noble hardship sir gilbert
hay but the yoke with which your brave ancestor
turned the battle at loncarty would
serve my turn well enough i am little used to
sword or harness that i have not wrought myself
because i do not well know what blows
the one will bear out without being cracked
or the other lay on without snapping
the cry had in the meanwhile run through
the multitude and passed into the town that
the dauntless smith was about to fight without
armour when just as the fated hour was approaching
the shrill voice a female was heard
screaming for passage through the crowd the
multitude gave place to her importunity and
she advanced breathless with haste under the
burden a mail hauberk and a large twohanded
sword the widow oliver proudfate
was soon recognised and the arms which
bhe bore were those the smith himself which
occupied by her husband on the fatal evening
when he was murdered had been naturally
conveyed to his house with the dead body and
were now by the exertions his grateful widow
brought to the lists at a moment when
such proved weapons were the last consequence
to their owner henry joyfully received
the wellknown arms and the widow with trembling
haste assisted in putting them on and
then took leave him saying god for the
orphans champion and ill luck to all who
come before him 
confident at feeling himself in his wellproved
armour henry shook himself as if to settle
the steel shirt around him and unsheathing the
twohanded sword made it flourish over his
head cutting the air through which it whistled
in the form the figure eight with an ease
and sleight hand that proved how powerfully
and skilfully he could wield the ponderous
weapon the champions were now ordered to
march in their turns around the lists crossing
eo as to avoid meeting each other and making
obeisance as they passed the golden arbour
where the king was seated
while this course was performing most 
the spectators were again curiously comparing
the stature limbs and sinews the two parties
and endeavouring to form a conjecture as to
the probable issue the combat the feud 
a hundred years with all its acts aggression
and retaliation was concentrated in the bosom
 each combatant their countenances seemed
fiercely writhen into the wildest expression 
pride hate and a desperate purpose fighting
to the very last
the spectators murmured a joyful applause
in highwrought expectation the bloody game
wagers were offered and accepted both on the
general issue the conflict and on the feats 
particular champions the clear frank and elated
look henry smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators and odds to
use the modern expression were taken that he
would kill three his opponents before he himself
fell scarcely was the smith equipped for the
combat when the commands the chiefs ordered
the champions into their places and at the
same moment henry heard the voice simon
glover issuing from the crowd who were now
silent with expectation and calling on him
harry smith harry smith what madness
hath possessed thee 
ay he wishes to save his hopeful soninlaw
that is or is to be from the smith's handling
was henry's first thought his second
was to turn and speak with him and his third
that he could on no pretext desert the band
which he had joined or even seem desirous to
delay the fight consistently with honour
he turned himself therefore to the business
 the hour both parties were disposed by
the respective chiefs in three lines each containing
ten men they were arranged with such
intervals between each individual as offered him
scope to wield his sword the blade which was
five feet long not including the handle the second
and third lines were to come up as reserves
in case the first experienced disaster on the
right the array clan quhele the chief
eachin maclan placed himself in the second
line betwixt two his fosterbrothers four
 them occupied the right the first line
whilst the father and two others protected the
rear the beloved chieftain torquil in particular
kept close behind for the purpose covering
him thus eachin stood in the centre 
nine the strongest men his band having
four especial defenders in front one on each
hand and three in his rear
the line the clan chattan was arranged
in precisely the same order only that the chief
occupied the centre the middle rank instead
 being on the extreme right this induced
henry smith who saw in the opposing bands
only one enemy and that was the unhappy ea
chin to propose placing himself on the left 
the front rank the clan chattan but the
leader disapproved this arrangement and
having reminded henry that he owed him obedience
as having taken wages at his hand he
commanded him to occupy the space in the third
line immediately behind himself a post honour
cciuiiiily which henry could not decline
though he accepted it with reluctance
when the clans were thus drawn up opposed
to each other they intimated their feudal animosity
and their eagerness to engage by a wild
scream which uttered by the clan quhele was
answered and echoed back by the clan chattan
the whole at the same time shaking their swords
and menacing each other as if they meant to
conquer the imagination their opponents ere
they mingled in the actual strife
at this trying moment torquil who had
never feared for himself was agitated with
alarm on the part his dault yet consoled by
observing that he kept a determined posture 
and that the few words which he spoke to his
clan were delivered boldly and well calculated
to animate them to combat as expressing
his resolution to partake their fate in death or
victory but there was no time for further observation
the trumpets the king sounded a
charge the bagpipes blew up their screaming
and maddening notes and the combatants starting
forward in regular order and increasing

their pace till they came to a smart run met together
in the centre the ground as a furious
torrent encounters an advancing tide
for an instant or two the front lines hewing
at each other with their long swords seemed
engaged in a succession single combats 
but the second and third ranks soon came upon
either side actuated alike by the eagerness
 hatred and the thirst honour pressed
through the intervals and rendered the
scene a tumultuous chaos over which the huge
swords rose and sunk some still glittering
others streaming with blood appearing from
the wild rapidity with which they were swayed
rather to be put in motion by some complicated
machinery than to be wielded by human hands
some the combatants too much crowded
together to use those long weapons had already
betaken themselves to their poniards and endeavoured
to get within the swordsweep 
those opposed to them in the meantime blood
flowed fast and the groans those who fell began
to mingle with the cries those who fought 
for according to the manner the highlanders
at all times they could hardly be said to shout
but to yell those the spectators whose eyes
were best accustomed to such scenes blood
and confusion could nevertheless discover no
advantage yet acquired by either party the
conflict swayed indeed at different intervals
forwards or backwards butit was only in momentary
superiority which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding
exertion on the other side the wild notes
 the pipers were still heard above the tumult
and stimulated to farther exertions the fury 
the combatants
at once however and as if by mutual agreement
the instruments sounded a retreat it was
expressed in wailing notes which seemed to imply
a dirge for the fallen the two parties disengaged
themselves from each other to take
breath for a few minutes the eyes the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array 
the combatants as they drew off from the contest
but found it still impossible to decide which
had sustained the greater loss it seemed as if
the clan chattan had lost rather fewer men
than their antagonists but in compensation
the bloody plaids and shirts their party for
several on both sides had thrown their mantles
away showed more wounded men than the
clan qahele about twenty both sides lay
on the field dead or dying and arras and legs
lopped off heads cleft to the chine slashes deep
through the shoulder into the breast showed
at once the fury the combat the ghastly character
 the weapons used and the fatal strength
 the arms which wielded them the chief
 the clan chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage and was slightly
wounded eachin also had fought with spirit
surrounded by his bodyguard his sword
was bloody his bearing bold and warlike and
he smiled when old torquil folding him in his
arms loaded him with praises and with blessings

the two chiefs after allowing their followers
to breathe for the space about ten minutes
again drew up in their files diminished by nearly
one third llieir original number they
now chose their ground nearer to the river than
that on which they had formerly encountered
which was encumbered with the wounded
and the slain some the former were observed
from time to time to raise themselves to
gain a glimpse the field and sink back most
 them to die from the effusion blood which
poured from terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore

harry smith was easily distinguished by his
lowland habit as well as his remaining on the
spot where they had first encountered where he
stood leaning on his sword beside a corpse
whose bonneted head carried to ten yards distance
from the body by the force the blow
which had swept it off exhibited the oak leaf
the appropriate ornament the bodyguard 
eachin maclan since he slew this man henry
had not struck a blow but had contented
himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself and some which were aimed at the
chief macgillie chattanach became alarmed
when having given the signal that his men
should again draw together he observed that
his powerful recruit remained at a distance from
the ranks and showed little disposition to join
them
 what ails thee man said the chief
can so strong a body have a mean and cowardly
spirit come and make in to the combat

you as good as called me hireling but now
replied henry if i am such pointing to
the headless corpse i have done enough for
my day's wage
 he that serves me without counting his
hours replied the chief i reward him without
reckoning wages
 then said the smith i fight as a volunteer
and in the post which best likes me
 all that is at your own discretion replied
macgillie chattanach who saw the prudence
 humouring an auxiliary such promise
it is enough said henry and shouldering
his heavy weapon he joined the rest the
combatants with alacrity and placed himself
opposite to the chief the clan quhele
vol in u
it was then for the first time that eachin
showed some uncertainty he had long looked
up to henry as the best combatant which perth
and its neighbourhood could bring into the lists
his hatred to him as a rival was mingled with
recollection the ease with which he had once
though unarmed foiled his own sudden and
desperate attack and when he beheld him with
his eyes fixed in his direction the dripping
sword in his hand and obviously meditating
an attack on him individually his courage fell
and he gave symptoms wavering which did
not escape his fosterfather
it was lucky for eachin that torquil was
incapable from the formation his own temper
and that those with whom he had lived
to conceive the idea one his own tribe much
less his chief and fosterson being deficient
in animal courage could he have imagined
this his grief and rage might have driven him
to the fierce extremity taking eachin's life
to save him from staining his honour but
his mind rejected the idea that hisdault was a
personal coward as something which was monstrous
and unnatural that he was under the
influence enchantment was a solution which
superstition had suggested and he now anxiously
but in a whisper demanded hector does
the spell now darken thy spirit eachin 
yes wretch that i am answered the ua
happy youth and yonder stands the fell enchanter

 what exclaimed torquil and you
wear harness his making norman miserable
boy why brought you that accursed
mail 
if my arrow has flown astray i can but
shoot my life after it answered 
 stand firm you shall see me break
the spell
yes stand firm said torquil he maybe
a fell enchanter but my own ear has heard
and my own tongue has told that eachin shall
leave the battle whole free and un wounded 
let us see the saxon wizard who can gainsay
that he may be a strong man but the fair
forest the oak shall fall stock and bough
ere he lay a finger on my dault ring around
him mv sons bas air son eachin 
sos
the sons torquil shouted back the words
which signify death for hector 
encouraged by their devotion eachin renewed
his spirit and called boldly to the minstrels
 his clan said snas that is strike up
the wild pibroch again sounded the onset 
but the two parties approached each other more
slowly than at first as men who knew and respected
each other's valour henry wynd in
bis impatience to begin the contest advanced
before the clan chattan and signed to eachin
to come on norman however sprang forward
to cover his fosterbrother and there was
a general though momentary pause as if both
parties were willing to obtain an omen the
fate the day from the event this duel
the highlander advanced with his large sword
uplifted as in act to strike but just as he
came within sword's length he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon leapt lightly over the
smith's sword as he fetched a cut at him drev
his dagger and being thus within henry's guard
struck him with the weapon his own gift on
the side the throat directing the blow downwards
into the chest and calling aloud at the
same time you taught me the stab 
but henry wynd wore his own good hauberk
doubly defended with a lining tempered
steel had he been less surely armed his combats
had been ended for ever even as it was
he was slightly wounded
fool he replied striking norman a blow
with the pommel his long sword which
made him stagger backwards you were
taught the thrust but not the parry and fetching
a blow at his antagonist which cleft his
skull through the steelcap he strode over the
lifeless body to engage the young chief who
now stood open before him
but the sonorous voice torquil thundered
out far veil air son eachin another for
hector and the two brethren vho flanked
their chief on each side thrust forward upon
henry and striking both at once compelled
him to keep the defensive
 ff forward race the tiger cat cried
macgillie chattanach save the brave saxon 
let these kites feel your talons 
already much wounded the chief dragged
himself up to the smith's assistance and cut
down one the leichtachy by whom he was assailed
henry's own good sword rid him 
the other
rest air son eachin again for hector
shouted the faithful fosterfather
bas air soi eachin p death for hector
answered two more his devoted sons and
opposed themselves to the fury the smith
and those who had come to his aid while eachin
moving towards the left wing the battle
sought less formidable adversaries and again
by some show valour revived the sinking
hopes his followers the two children the
oak who had covered this movement shared
the fate their brethren for the cry the clan
chattan chief had drawn to that part the field
some his bravest warriors the sons torquit
did not fall unavenged but left dreadful
marks their swords on the persons the
dead and living but the necessity keeping
their most distinguished soldiers around the person
 their chief told to disadvantage on the
w
ieoeial event the combat ami so few were
uow the number who remained lighting that it
was easy to see that the clan chattan hard fifteen
 their number left though most them
wounded and that the clan quhele only
about ten remained whom there were four 
the chiefs bodyguard including torquil himself

they fought and struggled on however and
as their strength decayed their fury seemed to
increase henry wynd now wounded in many
places was still bent on breaking through or
exterminating the band bold hearts who continued
to fight around the object his animosity
but still the father's shout another
for hector was cheerfully answered by the
fatal countersign death for hector and
though the clan quhele were now outnumbered
the combat seemed still dubious it was
bodily lassitude alone that again compelled
them to another pause
the clan chattan were then observed to be
twelve in number but two or three were scarce
able tp stand without leaning on their swords
n
five were left the clan quhele torquil and
his youngest son were the number both slightly
wounded eachin alone had from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against
his person escaped without injury the rage
 both parties had sunk through exhaustion
into sullen desperation they walked staggering
as if in their sleep through the carcasses
 the slain and gazed on them as if again to
animate their hatred towards their sursaving
enemies by viewing the friends they had lost
the multitude soon after beheld the survivors
 the desperate conflict drawing together to
renew the exterminating feud on the banks 
the river as the spot least slippery with blood
and less encumbered with the bodies the
slain
for god's sake for the sake the mercy
which we daily pray for said the kindhearted
old king to the duke albany let this be
ended wherefore should these wretched rags
and remnants humanity be suffered to complete
their butchery surely they will now be
ruled and accept peace on moderate terms 
compose yourself my liege said his brother
 these men are the pest the lowlands
both chiefs are still living if they go
back unharmed the whole day's work is castaway
remember your promise to the council
that you would not cry hold
iyou compel me to a great crime albany
both as a king who should protect his subjects
and as a christian man who respects the brother
 his faith
 you judge wrong my lord said the duke 
these are not loving subjects but disobedient
rebels as my lord crawford can bear witness
 and they are still less christian men for
the prior the dominicans will vouch for me
that they are more than half heathen
the king sighed deeply you must work
your pleasure and are too wise for me to contend
with i can but turn away and shut my eyes
from the sights and sounds a carnage which
makes me sicken but well i know that god
will punish me even for witnessing this waste
 human life

i would to heaven my royal brother said
albany with a voice half choked that the
bloody field we have seen were the worst we had
to see or hear this day i should waste little
sorrow on the wild kerne who lie piled on it
like carrion but he paused
 how exclaimed the king in terror 
what new evil rothsay it must be it is
rothsay speak out what new folly has
been done what fresh mischance 
my lord my liege folly and mischance
are now ended with my hapless nephew
 he is dead he is dead screamed the
agonized parent albany as thy brother i
conjure thee but no i am thy brother no
longer as thy king dark and subtle man i
charge thee to tell the worst 
albany faltered out the details are but
imperfectly known to me but the certainty is
that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his
apartment last night from sudden illness as i
have heard 
o rothsay o my beloved robert 
would to god i had died for thee my son my
son
so spoke in the emphatic words scripture
the helpless and bereft father tearing his greybeard
and hoary hair while albany speechless
and consciencestruck did not venture to interrupt
the tempest his grief but the agony 
the king's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fmyj a mood so contrary to the gentleness and
timidity his nature that the remorse albany
was drowned in his fear
and this is the said the king 
thy moral saws irreligious punishments but
the besotted father who gave the son into thy
hands who gave the innocent lamb to the
butcher is a king and thou shalt know it to
thy cost shall the murderer stand in presence
 his brother stained with the blood that
brother's son no what ho without there 
maclouis brandanes treachery 
murder take arms if you love the stewart 
maclouis with several the guards rushed
into the apartment
murder and treason exclaimed the miserable
king brandanes your noble prince 
here his grief and agitation interrupted for a
moment the fatal information it was his object
to convey at length he resumed his broken
speech an axe and a block instantly into the
courtyard arrest the word choked his
utterance
arrest whom my noble liege said maclouis
who observing the king influenced by
a tide passion so different from the gentleness
 his ordinary demeanour almost conjectured
that his brain had been disturbed by
the unusual horrors the combat he had witnessed
 whom shall i arrest my liege he
replied here is none but your grace's royal
brother albany 
most true said the king his brief fit 
vindictive passion soon dying away most
true none but albany none but my parents
child none but my brother o god enable me
to quell the sinful passion which glows in this
bosom sancta marian ora pro nobis 
maclouis cast a look wonder towards the
duke albany who endeavoured to hide his
confusion under an affectation deep sympathy
and muttered to the officer 
the great misfortune has been too much
for his understanding
what misfortune please your grace replied
maclouis i have heard none
how not heard the death my nephew
rothsay 
the duke rothsay dead my lord 
albany exclaimed the faithful braudauewith
the utmost horror and astonishment when
how and where fnq floi iio ho sfuog
two days since the manner as yet unknown
 at falkland
maclouis gazed at the duke for an instant 
then with a kindling eye and determined look
said to the king who seemed deeply engaged in
his mental devotion my liege a minute or
two since you left a word one word unspoken
let it pass yyir lips and your pleasure
is law to your brandanes 
 i was praying against temptation maclouis
said the heartbroken king and you
bring it to me would you arm a madman with
a drawn weapon but oh albany my friend
my brother my bosom counsellor how how
comest thou by the heart to do this 
albany seeing that the king's mood was
softening replied with more firmness than before
 my castle is no barrier against the
power death i have n and why unfortunate i pray you exclaimed
the youth if i am coward and villain have
not villainy and cowardice command over the
elements have i not braved the water without
its choking me and trod the firm earth without
its opening to devour me and shall a
mortal oppose my purpose 
 he raves alas said catharine haste
to call some help he will not harm me but
i fear he will do evil to himself see how he
stares down on the roaring waterfall i
the gleewoman hastened to do as she was
ordered and conachar's halffrenzied spirit
seemed relieved by her absence catharine
he said now she is gone i will say i know
thee i know thy love peace and hatred 
war but hearken i have rather than strike
a blow at my enemy given up all that a man
s
calls dearest i have lost honour fame and
friends and such friends he placed his hands
before this face oh their love surpassed the
love woman why should i hide my tears 
all know my shame all should see my sorrow
yes all might see but who would pity
it catharine as i ran like a madman down
the strath man and woman called shame on
me the beggar to whom i flung an alms that
i might purchase one blessing threw it back in
disgust and with a curse upon the coward 
each bell that tolled rung out shame on the recreant
caitiff the brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating the wild winds in their rustling
and howling the hoarse waters in their dash
and roar cried out upon the dastard the
faithful nine are still pursuing me they cry
with feeble voice strike but one blow in our
revenge we all died for you 
while the unhappy youth thus raved a rustling
was heard in the bushes there is but one
way he exclaimed springing upon the parapet
but with a terrified glance towards the thicket
through which one or two attendants were stealing
with the purpose surprising him but
the instant he saw a human form emerge from
the cover the thicket he waved his hands
wildly over his head and shrieking out bas
air eachin plunged down the precipice into
the raging cataract beneath
it is needless to say that aught save thistledown
must have been dashed to pieces in such
a fall but the river was swelled and the remains
 the unhappy youth were never seen
a varying tradition has assigned more than one
supplement to the history it is said by one
account that the young captain clan quhele
swam safe to shore far below the linnsof carats
 and that wandering disconsolately in the
deserts ranch he met with father clement
who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit on the principle the old
culdees he converted it is said the heartbroken
and penitent conachar who lived with
him in his cell sharing his devotion and privations
till death removed them in succession
another wilder legend supposes that he was
snatched from death by the daioneshieyoviiayy
folk aud that he continues to wander throws
wood and wild arrived like an ancient highlander
but carrying his sword in his left hand the
phantom appears always in deep grief sometimes
he seems about to attack the traveller
but when resisted with courage always flies
these legends are founded on two peculiar
points in his story his evincing timidity and
his committing suicide both them circumstances
unexampled in the history a mountain
chief
when simon glover having seen his friend
henry duly taken care in his own house in
curfew street arrived that evening at the
place campsieie he found his daughter extremely
ill a fever in consequence the
scenes to which she had lately been a witness
and particularly the catastrophe her late playmate
the affection the gleemaiden rendered
her so attentive and careful a nurse that
the glover said it should not be his fault if she
ever touched lute again save for her own amusement

it was some time ere simon ventured to tell
hi daughter henrys late exploits and his
severe wounds and he took care to make the
most the encouraging circumstance that her
faithful lover had refused both honour and
wealth rather than become a professed soldier
and follow the douglas catharine sighed
deeply and shook her head at the history 
bloody palm sunday on the north inch but
apparently she had reflected that men rarely
advance in civilization or refinement beyond
the ideas their own age and that a headlong
and exuberant courage like that henry
smith was in the iron days in which they lived
preferable to the deficiency which had led to
conachar's catastrophe if she had any doubts
on the subject they were removed in due time
by henry's protestations so soon as restored
health enabled him to plead his own cause
i should blush to say catharine that i
am even sick the thoughts doing battle
yonder last field showed carnage enough to
glut a tiger i am therefore resolved to hang
up my broad sword never to be drawn more
unless against the enemies scotland
 and should scotland call for it said catharine
 i will buckle it round you
and catharine said the joyful glover
we will pay largely for soul masses for those
who have fallen by henry's sword and that
will not only cure spiritual flaws but make us
friends with the church again
for that purpose father said catharine
the hoards the wretched d wining may be
applied he bequeathed them to me but i think
you would not mix his base bloodmoney with
your honest gains 
i would bring the plague into ray house as
soon said the resolute glover
the treasures the wicked apothecary were
distributed accordingly among the four monasteries
 nor was there ever after a breath suspicion
concerning the orthodoxy old simon
or his daughter
henry and catharine were married within
four months after the battle the north inch
and never did the corporations the glovers
and hammered trip their sworddance so featly
as at the wedding the boldest burgess and
brightest maiden in perth ten months after

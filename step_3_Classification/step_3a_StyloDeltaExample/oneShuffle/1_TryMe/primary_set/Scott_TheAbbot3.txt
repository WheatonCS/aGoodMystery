in proportion all other sports
were discontinued the dance around the
maypole was arrested the ring broken up
and dispersed while the dancers each leading
his partner by the hand tripped off to the
sylvan theatre a truce was in like manner
achieved betwixt a huge brown bear and
certain mastiffs who were tugging and pulling
at his shaggy coat under the mediation
 the bear ward and half a dozen butchers
and yeomen who by dint staving entailing
as it was technically termed separated
the unfortunate animals whose fury
had for an hour past been their chief amusement
the itinerant minstrel found himself
deserted by the audience he had collected
even in the most interesting passage

as he was sending about his boy with
bonnet in hand to collect their oblations
he indignantly stopped short in the midst

was content to respire in the manner ordinary
mortals rather than to play gratuitously

all other sports were suspended so eagerly
did the revellers throng towards the place
 representation
they would err greatly who should regulate
their ideas this dramatic exhibition
upon those derived from a modern theatre
 for the rude shews thespis were far
less different from those exhibited by euripides
on the stage athens with all its
magnificentdecorations and pompous dresses
and scenery in the present case there
were no scenes no stage no machinery no
pit box and gallery no box lobby and
what might in poor scotland be some consolation

with seats on the artificial bank which
had been raised around three fourths the
playground the remainder being left open
for the entrance and exit the performers
here sate the uncritical audienccjthe chamberlain
in the centre as the person highest
in office all alive to enjoyment and admiration
and all therefore dead to criticism
the characters which appeared and disappeared
before the amused and interested
audience were those which fill the earlier
stage in all nations old men cheated by
their wives and daughters pillaged by their
sons and imposed on by their domestics a
braggadocio captain a knavish pardoner
or questioner a country bumpkin and a
wanton city dame amid all these and
more acceptable than almost the whole put
together was the alllicensed fool the gracious
 the spanish drama who with his
the abbot 
cap fashioned into the resemblance a
coxcomb and his bauble a truncheon terminated
by a carved figure wearing a fool'scap
in his hand went came and returned
mingling in every scene the piece and
interrupting the business without having
any share himself in the action and ever
and anon transferring his gibes from the
actors on the stage to the audience who
sate around prompt to applaud the whole
the wit the piece which was not 
the most polished kind was chiefly directed
against the superstitious practices the
catholic religion j and the stage artillery
had on this occasion been levelled by no
less a person than doctor lundin who
had not only commanded the manager 
the entertainment to select one the numerous
satires which had been written
against the papists several which were
cast in a dramatic form but had even like
the prince denmark caused them to insert
or according to his own phrase to infuse
here and there a few pleasantries 
 the abbot
his own penning on the same inexhaustible
subject hoping thereby to mollify the
rigour the lady lochleven towards
pastimes this description he failed not
to jog roland's elbow who was sitting instate
behind him and recommend to his
particular attention those favourite passages
as for the page to whom the very
idea such an exhibition simple as it
was was entirely new he beheld it with
the undiminished and ecstatic delight with
which men all ranks look for the first
time on dramatic representation and laughed
shouted and clapped his hands as the
performance proceeded an incident at
length took place which effectually broke
off his interest in the business the scene
one the principal personages in the
comic part the drama was as we have
already said a qusestionaryor pardoner one
 those itinerants who hawked about from
place to place reliques real or pretended
with which he excited the devotion at once
and the charity the populace and generalthe
abbot 
y deceived both the one and the other the
hypocrisy impudence and profligacy 
these clerical wanderers had made them the
subject satire from the time chaucer
down to that heywood their present
representative failed not to follow the same
line humour exhibiting pig's bones lor
reliques and boasting the virtues small
tin crosses which had been shaken in the
holy porringer at lorenzo and cockleshells
which had been brought from the
shrine saint james composedly all
which he disposed to the devout catholics
at nearly as high a price as antiquaries
are now willing to pay for baubles similar
intrinsic value at length the pardoner
pulled from his scrip a small phial clear
vater which he vaunted the quality in
the following verses 
listneth gode people everiche one
for in the lone babylon

and is the first lone the sonne espieth

the jest as the reader skilful in the antique
language the drama must at once
perceive turned on the same pivot as in the
old minstrel tales the drinking horn 
king arthur and the mantle made amiss
but the audience were neither learned nor
critical enough to challenge its want originality
the potent relique was after
such grimace and buffoonery as befitted the
subject presented successively to each 
the female personages the drama not
one whom sustained the supposed test
 discretion but to the infinite delight 
the abbot 
the audience sneezed much louder and
longer than perhaps they themselves had
counted on the jest seemed at last worn
threadbare and the pardoner was passing
on to some new pleasantry when the jester
or clown the drama possessing himself
secretly the phial which contained the
wondrous liquor applied it suddenly to the
nose a young woman who with her
black silk muffler or screen drawn over her
face was sitting in the foremost rank the
spectators intent apparently upon the business
 the stage the contents the
phial well calculated to sustain the credit
 the pardoner's legend set the damsel a
sneezing violently an admission frailty
which was received with shouts rapture
by the audience these were soon however
renewed at the expence the jester
himself when the insulted maiden extricated
ere the paroxysm was well over one
hand from the folds her mantle and bestowed
on the wag a buffet which made him
reel fully his own length from the pardoner
 the abbot
and then acknowledge the favour by instant
prostration
no one pities a jester overcome in his
vocation and the clown met with little sympathy
when rising from the ground and
whimpering forth his complaints harsh
treatment he invoked the assistance and
sympathy the audience but the chamberlain
feeling his own dignity insulted ordered
two his halberdiers to bring the
culprit before him when these official persons
first approached the virago she threw
herself into an attitude firm defiance as
if determined to resist their authority j and
from the sample strength and spirit which
she had already displayed they shewed no
alacrity at executing their commission but
on half a minute's reflection the damsel
changed totally her attitude and manner
folded her cloak around her arms in modest
and maidenlike fashion and walked her
own accord to the presence the great
man followed and guarded by the two manful
satellites as she moved across the vathe
abbot 
cant space and more especially as she stood
at the footstool the doctor's judgmentseat
the maiden discovered that lightness
and elasticity step and natural grace 
manner which connoisseurs in female beauty
know to be seldom divided from it
moreover her neat russetcoloured jacket
and short petticoat the same colour displayed
a handsome form and a pretty leg
her features were concealed by the screen j
but the doctor whose gravity did not prevent
his pretensions to be a connoisseur 
the school we have hinted at saw enough
to judge favourably the piece by the
sample
he began however with considerable
austerity manner and how nosy
saucy quean said the medical man office
 what have you to say why i shout
not order you to be ducked in the loch for
lifting your hand to the man in my presence

 marry replied the culprit because
 the abbot
i judge that your honour will not think the
cold bath necessary for my complaints
a pestilent jade said the doctor whispering
to roland grme and i'll warrant
her a good one her voice is as sweet as
syrup but my pretty maiden said he
you shew us wonderfully little that
countenance yours be pleased to throw
aside your muffler
 i trust your honour will excuse me till
we are more private answered the maiden 
for i have acquaintance and i should hke
ill to be known in the country as the poor
girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest
upon
fear nothing for thy good name my
sweet little modicum candied manna
replied the doctor for i protest to you
as i am chamberlain lochleven kinross
and so forth that the chaste susanna
herself could not have snuffed that elixir
without sternutation being in truth a curious
distillation rectified acefum or vinegar
 the sun prepared by mine own hands
the abbot 
wherefore as thou mayest thou wilt come
to me in private and express thy contrition
for the offence whereof thou hast been guilty
i command that all for the present go
forward as if no such interruption the
prescribed course had taken place
the damsel curtsied and tripped back to
her place the play proceeded but it no
longer attracted the attention roland
gramme
the voice the figure and what the veil
permitted to be seen the neck and tresses
 the village damsel bore so strong a resemblance
to those catherine seton
that he felt like one bewildered in the mazes
 a changeful and studying dream the
memorable scene the hostelry rushed on
his recollection with all its doubtful and
marvellous circumstances were the tales
 enchantment which he had read in romances
realized in this extraordinary girl 
could she transport herself from the walled
and guarded castle lochleven moaned
with its broad lake towards which he cast
 the abbot
back a look as if to ascertain it was still inexistence
and watched with such scrupulous
care as the safety a nation demanded
 could she surmount all these obstacles
and make such careless and dangerous use
 her liberty as to engage herself publicly
in a quarrel in a village fair roland was
unable to determine whether the exertions
which it must have cost her to gain her
freedom or the use to which she had put
it rendered her the most unaccountable
creature
lost in these meditations he kept his
gaze fixed on the subject them and in
every casual motion discovered or thought
he discovered something which reminded
him still more strongly catherine seton
it occurred to him more than once indeed
that he might be deceiving himself by exaggerating
some casual likeness into absolute
identity but then the meeting at the
hostelry saint michael's returned to his
mind and it seemed in the highest degree
improbable that under such various cir
the abbot 
substances mere imagination should twice
have found opportunity to play him the selfsame
trick this time however he determined
to have his doubts resolved and for
this purpose he sate during the rest the
play like a greyhound in the slip ready
to spring upon the hare the instant that she
was started the damsel whom he watched
attentively lest she should escape in
the crowd when the spectacle was closed
sate as if perfectly unconscious that she was
observed but the worthy doctor marked
the direction his eyes and magnanimously
suppressed his own inclination to become
the theseus to this hippolyta in deference to
the rights hospitality which enjoined him
to forbear interference with the pleasurable
pursuits his young friend he passed one
or two formal gibes upon the fixed attention
which the page paid to the unknown and
upon his own jealousy adding however that
if both were to be presented to the patient
at once he had little doubt she would think
the younger man the sounder prescription
 the abbot
i fear me he added we shall have no
news the knave auchtermuchty for sometime
since the vermin whom i sent after
him seem to have proved corbiemessengers
so you have an hour or two on your
hands master page and as the minstrels
are beginning to strike up now that the
play is ended why an you incline for a
dance yonder is the green and there sits
your partner i trust you will hold me perfect
in ray diagnostics since i see with half
an eye what disease you are sick and
have administered a pleasing remedy
discern sapiens res as chambers hath it quae con
pundit apelles
the page hardly heard the the
learned adage or the charge which the
chamberlain gave him to be within reach
in case the pains arriving suddenly and
sooner than expected so eager he was at
once to shake himself free his learned associate
and to satisfy his curiosity regarding
the unknown damsel yet in the haste
the abbot 
with which he made towards her he found
time to reflect that in order to secure an
opportunity conversing with her in private
he must not alarm her at first accosting
her he therefore composed his manner
and gait and advancing with becoming selfconfidence
before three or four countryfellows
who were intent on the same design
but knew not so well how to put their request
into shape he acquainted her that he
as the deputy the venerable chamberlain
requested the honour her hand as a partner

the venerable chamberlain said the
damsel frankly reaching the page her hand
 does very well to exercise this part his
privilege by deputy and i suppose the laws
 the revels leave me no choice but to accept
 his faithful delegate
 providing fair damsel said the page
his choice a delegate is not altogether
distasteful to you
 that fair sir replied the maiden
 the abbot
 i will tell you more when we have danced
the first measure
we have mentioned that catherine seyton
had admirable skill in gestic lore and
that she was sometimes called on to dance
for the amusement her royal mistress roland
graeme had often been a spectator 
her sml and sometimes at the queen's command
catherine's partner on such occasions
he was therefore perfectly acquainted with
catherine's mode dancing and observed
that his present partner in grace in agility
in quickness ear and precision execution
exactly resembled her save that the
scottish jigg which he now danced with
her required a more violent and rapid motion
and more rustic agility than the stately
parens lavoltas and counties which
he had seen her execute in the chamber 
queen mary the active duties the
dance left him little time for reflection and
none for conversation but when their jades
deux was finished amidst the acclama
the abbot 
tions the villagers who had seldom witnessed
such an exhibition he took an opportunity
when they yielded up the green to
another couple to use the privilege a
partner and enter into conversation with
the mysterious maiden whom he still held
by the hand fair partner may i not
crave the name her who has graced me
thus far 
you may said the maiden but it
is a question whether shall answer you
 and why asked roland
 because nobody gives anything for nothing
 and you can tell me nothing in return
which i care to hear
 could i not tell you my name and lineage
in exchange for yours returned
roland
 no answered the maiden for you
know little either
 how said the page somewhat angrily

wrath you not for the matter said
the damsel i will shew you in an instant
 the abbot
that i know more you than you do 
yourself
 indeed answered graeme for whom
then do you take me 
 for the wild falcon answered she
whom a dog brought in his mouth to a
certain castle when he was but an unfledged
eyass for the hawk whom men dare
not let fly lest he should check at game
and pounce on carrion whom folks must
keep hooded till he has the proper light 
his eyes and can discover good from evil
well be it so replied roland graeme
i guess at a part your parable fair mistress
mine and perhaps i know as much
 you as you do me and can well dispense
with the information which you are
so niggard in giving
 prove that said the maiden and i
will give you credit for more penetration
than i judged you to be gifted withal
 it shall be proved instantly said roland
graeme the first letter your
name is s and the last n
the abbot 
admirable said his partner guess
on
it pleases you today continued roland
 to wear the snood and kirtle and
perhaps you may be seen tomorrow in hat
and feather hose and doublet
in the clout in the clout you have
hit the very white said the damsel suppressing
a great inclination to laugh
you can switch men's eyes out their
heads as well as the heart out their bosoms

these last words were uttered in a low
and tender tone which to roland's great
mortification and somewhat to his displeasure
was so far from allaying that it greatly
increased his partner's disposition to
laughter she could scarce compose herself
while she replied if you had thought
my hand so formidable extricating it from
his grasp you would not have grasped it
so hard but i perceive you know me so
fully that there is no occasion to shew you
mv face
 the abbot
 fair catherine said the page he
were unworthy ever to have seen you far
less to have dwelt so long in the same service
and under the same roof with you who
could mistake your air your gesture your
step in walking or in dancing the turn 
your neck the symmetry your form
none could be so dull as not to recognize
you by so many proofs but for me i could
swear even to that tress hair that escapes
from under your muffler
and to the face course which that
muffler covers said the maiden removing
her veil and in an instant endeavouring to
replace it she shewed the features catherine
 but an unusual degree petulant
impatience inflamed them when from some
awkwardness in her management the
muffler she was unable again to adjust it
with that dexterity which was a principal
accomplishment the coquettes the
time
 the fiend rive the rag to tatters said
the damsel as the veil fluttered about her
the abbott s
shoulders with an accent so earnest and
decided that it made the page start he
looked again at the damsel's face but the
information which his eyes received was to
the same purport as before he assisted
her to adjust her muffler and both were for
for an instant silent the damsel spoke
first for roland greene was overwhelmed
with surprise at the contrarieties which catherine
seyton seemed to include in her
person and character
 you are surprised said the damsel to
him at what you see and hear but the
times which make females men are least 
all fitted for men to become women yet you
yourself are in danger such a change
 i in danger becoming effeminate 
said the page
yes you for all the boldness your
reply said the damsel when you should
hold fast your religion because it is assailed
on all sides by rebels traitors and heretics
you let it glide out your breast like wavol
iii b
 the abbot

ter grasped in the hand if you are driven
from the faith your fathers from fear 
a traitor is not that womanish if you
are cajoled by the cunning arguments a
trumpeter heresy or the praises a puritanic
old woman is not that womanish 
if you are bribed by the hope spoil
and preferment is not that womanish 
and when you wonder at my venting a
threat or an execration should you not
wonder at yourself who pretending to a
gentle name and aspiring to knighthood
can be at the same time cowardly silly
and selfinterested 
i would that a man would bring such
a charge said the page he should see
ere his life was a minute older whether he
had cause to term me coward or no
 beware such big words answered
the maiden you said but anon that i
sometimes wear hose and doublet
 but remain still catherine seyton
wear what you list said the page endear
abbot 
pouring again to possess himself her
hand
 you indeed are pleased to call me
so replied the maiden evading his intention
 but i have many another name besides

 and will you not reply to that said
the page by which you are distinguished
beyond every other maiden in scotland

the damsel unaltered by his praises still
kept aloof and sung with gaiety a verse from
an old ballad
o some do call me jack sweet love
and some do call me gill 
but when i ride to holyrood
my name is wilful will
 wilful will exclaimed the page
impatiently say rather will o the wisp
jack with the lantern for never was such
a deceitful or wandering meteor
 if i be such replied the maiden i
 the abbot
ask no fools to follow me if they do so it
is at their own pleasure and must be on
their own proper peril
 nay but dearest catherine said
roland graeme be for one instant serious

 if you will call me your dearest catherine
when i have given you so many
names to chuse upon replied the damsel
 i would ask you how supposing me
for two or three hours my life escaped
from yonder tower you have the cruelty
to ask me to be serious during the only
merry moments i have seen perhaps for
months 
ay but fair catherine there are moments
 deep and true feeling which are
worth ten thousand years the liveliest
mirth and such was that yesterday when
you so nearly
 so nearly what demanded the darnsel
hastily
 when you approached your hips so
the abbot 
near to the sign you had traced on my forehead

mother heaven said she in a yet
fiercer tone and with a more masculine
manner than she had yet exhibited catherine
seyton approach her lips to a man's
brow and thou that man vassal thou
lies r
the page stood astonished but conceiving
he had alarmed the damsel's delicacy
by alluding to the enthusiasm a moment
and the manner in which she had expressed
it he endeavoured to faulter forth an
apology his excuses though he was unable
to give them any regular shape were
accepted by his companion who had indeed
suppressed her indignation after its first explosion
 speak no more on't she said 
and now let us part our conversation may
attract more notice than is convenient for
either us
 nay but allow me at least to follow
you to some sequestered place
so the abbot
 you dare not replied the maiden
how said the youth dare not 
where is it you dare go where i dare not
follow r
you fear a will o the wisp said the
damsel how would you face a fiery dragon
with an enchantress mounted on its
back 
like sir ever sir grime or sir greysteel
said the page but be there such
toys to be seen here 
 go to mother nicneven's answered
the maid and she is witch enough to
rein the horned devil with a red silk thread
for a bridle and a rowantree switch for a
whip
 i will follow you said the page
let it be at some distance said the
maiden
and wrapping her mantle around her
with more success than on her former attempt
she mingled with the throng and
walked towards the village heed fully folthe
abbot 
lowed by roland gramme at some distance
and under every precaution which he could
use to prevent his purpose from being observed

that now with these same eyeballs dirnm'd with age
and dimnict yct with tears sees thy dishonour
old play
at the entrance the principal or indeed
so to speak the only street in kinross
the damsel whose steps were pursued by
roland graeme cast a glance behind her
as if to be certain he had not lost trace 
her and then plunged down a very narrow
lane which run betwixt two rows poor
and ruinous cottages she paused for a second
at the door one those miserable
tenements again cast her eye up the lane
towards roland then lifted the latch opened
the door and disappeared from his view
with whatever haste the page followed
the abbot s

her example the difficulty which he found
in discovering the trick the latch which
did not work quite in the usual manner
and in pushing open the door which did
not yield to his first effort delayed for a
minute or two his entrance into the cottage
a dark and smoky passage passed as
usual betwixt the exterior wall the house
and the hullan or claywall which served asa
partition betwixt and the interior at the
 this passage and through the partition
was a door leading into the hen or
inner chamber the cottage and when
roland gramme's hand was upon the latch
 this door a female voice pronounced
benedictus qui venial in nomine domini 
damascus qui in wmiie inimici on entering
the apartment he perceived the figure
which the chamberlain had pointed out to
him as mother nicneven seated beside the
lowly hearth but there was no other person
in the room roland graeme gazed
around in surprise at the disappearance 
catherine seyton without paying much reb

 the abbot
gard to the supposed sorceress until she
attracted and rivetted his regard by the
tone in which she asked him what seekest
thou here 
 i seek said the page with much embarrassment
 i seek 
but his answer was cut short when the
old woman drawing her huge grey eyebrows
sternly together with a frown which
knitted her brow into a thousand wrinkles
arose and stretching herself up to her full
natural size tore the kerchief from her
head and seizing roland by the arm made
two strides across the floor the apartment
to a small window through which the light
fell full on her face and shewed the astonished
youth the countenance magdalen
graeme yes roland she said thine
eyes deceive thee not they shew thee truly
the features her whom thou hast thyself
deceived whose wine thou hast turned into
gall her bread joyfulness into bitter poison
her hope into the blackest despair it is
she who now demands thee what meekest
the abbot
thou here she whose heaviest sin towards
heaven hath been that she loved thee even
better than the weal the whole church
and could not without reluctance surrender
thee even in the cause god she now
asks you what meekest thou here 
while she spoke she kept her broad black
eye rivetted on the youth's face with the
expression with which the eagle regards his
prey ere he tears it to pieces roland felt
himself at the moment incapable either
 reply or evasion this extraordinary
enthusiast had preserved over him in some
measure the ascendancy which she had
acquired during his childhood and besides
he knew the violence her passions and
her impatience contradiction and was
sensible that almost any reply which he
could make was like to throw her into an
ecstacy rage he was therefore silent
and magdalen graeme proceeded with encreasing
enthusiasm in her apostrophe
 once more what seek'st thou false boy
seest thou the honour thou hast renown
s the abbot
cet the faith thou hast abandoned the
hopes thou hast destroyed or didst thou
seek me the sole protectress thy youth
the only parent whom thou hast known
that thou mayst trample on my grey hairs
even as thou hast already trampled on the
best wishes my heart
 pardon me mother said roland
gramme j but in truth and reason deserve
not your blame i have been treated
amongst you even by yourself my reverend
parent as well as by others as one who
lacked the common attributes freewill
and human reason or was at least deemed
unfit to exercise them a land enchantment
have i been led into and spells have
been cast around me every one has met
me in disguise every one has spoke to mein
parables i have been like one who walks
in a weary and bewildering dream and now
you blame me that i have not the sense and
judgment and steadiness a waking and
a disenchanted and a reasonable man who
knows what he is doing and wherefore he
the abbot 
does it if one must walk with masks and
spectres who waft themselves from place to
place as it were in vision rather than reality
it might shake the soundest faith and turn
the wisest head i sought since i must
needs avow my folly the same catherine
seyton with whom you made me first acquainted
and whom i most strangely find
in this village kinross gayest among the
revellers when i had but just left her in the
wellguarded castle lochleven the sad
attendant an imprisoned queen i sought
her and in her place i find you my mother
more strangely disguised than even she is
 and what hadst thou to do with catherine
seyton said the matron sternly 
 is this a time or a world to follow maidens
or to dance around a maypole when the
trumpet summons every truehearted scotsman
around the standard the true sovereign
shalt thou be found loitering in a
lady's bower 
no by heaven nor imprisoned in the
rugged walls an island castle answered
 the abbot
roland grseme i would the blast were
to sound even now for i fear that nothing
less loud will dispel the chimerical visions
by which i am surrounded
 doubt not that it will be winded said
the matron and that so fearfully loud that
scotland will never hear the like until the
last and loudest blast all shall announce
to mountain and to valley that time is no
more meanwhile be thou but brave and
constant serve god and honour thy sovereign
 abide by thy religion i cannot 
i will not i dare not ask thee the truth 
the terrible surmises i have heard touching
thy falling away perfect not that accursed
sacrifice and yet even at this late hour
thou mayst be what i have hoped for the
son my dearest hope what say i theson
omy hope thou shalt be the hope scotland
her boast and her honour even thy
wildest and most foolish wishes may perchance
be fulfilled i shame to mingle meaner
motives with the noble guerdon i hold out
to thee it shames me being such as i am
the abbot 
to mention the idle passions youth save
with contempt and the purpose censure
but we must bribe children to wholesome
medicine by the offer cates and youth
to honourable achievement with the promise
 pleasure mark me therefore roland
the love catherine seyton will
follow him only who shall achieve the freedom
 her mistress and believe it maybe
one day in thine own power to be
that happy lover cast therefore away
doubt and fear and prepare to do what religion
calls for what thy country demands
 thee what thy duty as a subject and asa
servant alike require at your hand and
be assured even the idlest wishes thy
heart will be most readily attained by following
the call thy duty
as she ceased speaking a double knock
was heard against the inner door the matron
hastily adjusting her muffler and resuming
her chair by the hearth demanded
who was there
 the abbot
 salve in nomine sanctity was answered
from without
salute et vos answered magdalen
graeme
and a man entered in the ordinary dress
 a nobleman's retainer wearing at his
girdle a sword and buckler sought
you said he my mother and him whom
i see with you then addressing himself
to roland graeme he said to him hast
thou not a packet from george douglas 
 i have said the page suddenly recollecting
that which had been committed to
his charge in the morning but i may not
deliver it to any one without some token
that they have right to ask it
 you say well replied the servingman
and whispered into his ear the packet
which i ask is the report to his father will
this token suffice 
 it will replied the page and taking
the packet from his bosom gave it to the
man
the abbot 
 i will return presently said the 
and left the cottage
roland had now sufficiently recovered his
surprise to accost his relative in turn and
request to know the reason why he found
her in so precarious a disguise and a place
so dangerous you cannot be ignorant
he said the hatred that the lady 
lochleven bears to those your that is
 our religion your present disguise lays
you open to suspicions a different kind
but inferring no less hazard and whether
as a catholic or as a sorceress or as a friend
to the unfortunate queen you are in equal
danger if apprehended within the bounds
 thedouglasandinthechamberlainwho
administers their authority you have for
his own reasons an enemy and a bitter one
 i know it said the matron her eyes
kindling with triumph i know that vain
 his school craft and carnal wisdom luke
lundin views with jealousy and hatred the
blessings which the saints have conferred on
my prayers and on the holy reliques before
 the abbot
the touch nay before the bare presence 
which disease and death have so often been
known to retreat i know he would rend
and tear me but there is a chain and a
muzzle on the ban dog that shall restrain
his fury and the master's servant shall not
be offended by him until the master's work
is wrought when that hour comes let the
shadows the evening descend on me in
thunder and in tempest the time shall be
welcome that relieves my eyes from seeing
guilt and my ears from listening to blasphemy
do thou but be constant play
thy part as i have played and will play
mine and my release shall be like that a
blessed martyr which angels hail with psalm
and song while earth pursues him with hiss
and with execration
as she concluded the servingman again
entered the cottage and said all is well 
the time holds for tomorrow night
 what time what holds exclaimed
roland grasme trust i have given the
douglas's packet to no wrong
the abbot 
content yourself young man answered
the serving man thou hast my word
and token
 i know not if the token be right said
the page and i care not much for the
word a stranger
what said the matron although
thou mayst have given a packet delivered
to thy charge by one the queen's rebels
into the hand a loyal subject there were
no great mistake in that thou hotbrained
boy
 by saint andrew there were foul mistake
though answered the page it is
the very spirit my duty in this first stage
 chivalry to be faithful to my trust and
had the devil given me a message to discharge
i would not so i had plighted my
faith to the contrary betray his counsel to
an angel light
now by the love i once bore thee said
the matron i could slay thee with mine
own hand when hear thee talk a dearer
 the abbot
faith being due to rebels and heretic than
thou west to thy church and thy prince 
 be patient my good sister said the
serving man i will give him such reasons
as shall counterbalance the scruples which
beset him the spirit is honourable though
now it may be mistimed and misplaced 
follow me young man
 ere i go to call this stranger to a reckoning
said the page to the matron is
there nothing i can do for your comfort
and safety r
 nothing she replied nothing save
what will lead more to thy own honour the
saints who have protected me thus far will
lend me succour as i need it tread the
path glory that is before thee and only
think me as the creature on earth who
will be most delighted to hear thy fame
follow the stranger he hath tidings for
you that you little expect
the stranger remained on the threshold
as if waiting for roland and whenever he
the abbot 
saw him put himself in motion he moved
on before him at a quick pace diving
still deeper down the lane roland perceived
that it was now bordered by buildings
upon the one side only and that the
other was fenced by a high old wall over
which some trees extended their branches
descending a good way farther they came
to a small door in the wall roland's guide
paused looked around for an instant to see
if any one were within sight then taking
a key from his pocket opened the door and
entered making a sign to roland grasme
to follow him the guided did so and the
stranger locked the door carefully on the
inside during this operation the page had
a moment to look around and perceived
that he was in a small orchard very trimly
kept
the stranger led him through an alley or
two shaded by trees loaded with summerfruit
into a pleached arbour where taking
the turf seat which was on the one side he
motioned to roland to occupy that which
 the abbot
was opposite to him and after a momentary
silence opened the conversation as follows 
you have asked a better warrant than the
word a mere stranger to satisfy you that
i have the authority george douglas
for possessing myself the packet entrusted
to your charge 
 it is precisely the point on which demand
reckoning you said roland i
fear i have acted hastily if so must redeem
my error as i best may
you hold me then as a perfect stranger
said the man look at my face more
attentively and see if the features do not
resemble those a man much known to
you formerly
roland gazed attentively but the ideas
recalled to his mind were so inconsistent
with the mean and servile dress the person
before him that he did not venture to
express the opinion which he was irresistibly
induced to form
yes my son said the stranger observing
his embarrassment you do indeed
the abbot 
see before you the unfortunate father ambrose
who once accounted his ministry
crowned in your preservation from the
snares heresy but who is now condemned
to lament thee as a castaway 
roland graeme's kindness heart was
at least equal to his vivacity temper he
could not bear to see his ancient and honoured
master and spiritual guide in a situation
which inferred a change fortune
so melancholy but throwing himself at his
feet grasped his knees and wept aloud
 what mean these tears my son said
the abbot if they are shed for your own
sins and follies surely they are gracious
showers and may avail thee much but
weep not if they fall on my account you
indeed see the superior the community
 saint mary's in the dress a poor shorter
who gives his master the use his blade
and buckler and if needful his life for a
coarse livery coat and four marks by the
year but such a garb suits the time and
 the abbot
in the period the church militant as well
becomes her prelates as staff mitre and
crosier in the days the church's triumph
 by what fate said the page and yet
why added he checking himself need
i ask catherine seyton in some sort prepared
me for this but that the change
should be so absolute the destruction so
complete 
 yes my son said the abbot ambrosius
 thine own eyes beheld in my unworthy
elevation to the abbot's stall the
last especial act holy solemnity which
shall be seen in the church saint mary's
until it shall please heaven to turn back the
captivity the church for the present the
shepherd is smitten ay well nigh to the
earth the flock are scattered and the
shrines saints and martyrs and pious benefactors
to the church are given to the
owls night and the satyrs the desert
and your brother the knight 
 could he do nothing for your protection

the abbot 
he himself hath fallen under the suspicion
 the ruling powers said the abbot
 who are as unjust to their friends as
they are cruel to their enemies i could
not grieve at it did i hope it might estrange
him from his course but i know the soul
 halbert and i rather fear it will drive
him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy
cause by some deed which may be yet more
destructive to the church and rare offensive
to heaven enough this and now
to the business our meeting i trust you
will hold it sufficient if i pass my word to
you that the packet which you were lately
the bearer was designed for my hands by
george douglas 
 then said the page is george 
douglas
 a true friend to his queen roland
and will soon i trust have his eyes opened
to the errors his miscalled church
 but what is he to his father and what
to the lady lochleven who has been
vol ill c
 the abbot
as a mother to him said the page impatiently

 the best friend to both in time and
through eternity said the abbot if he
shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming
the evil they have wrought and
are still working
 still said the page i like not that
good service which begins in breach 
trust
i blame not thy scruples my son said
the abbot but the time which has wrenched
asunder the allegiance christians to
the church and subjects to their king
has dissolved all the lesser bonds society 
and in such days mere human ties must no
more restrain our progress than the brambles
and briars which catch hold his garments
should delay the path a pilgrim
who travels to pay his vows
but my father said the youth and
then stopped short in a hesitating manner
speak on my son said the abbot j
speak without fear
cc
the abbot 
 let me not offend you then said roland
 when i say that it is even this which
our adversaries charge against us that shaping
the means according to the we are
willing to commit great moral evil in order
that we may work out eventual good
 the heretics have played their usual
arts on you my son said the abbot they
would willingly deprive us the power
 acting wisely and secretly though their
possession superior force forbids our contending
with them on the terms equality
they have reduced us to a state exhausted
weakness and now would fain proscribe
the means by which weakness through
all the range nature supplies the lack
 strength and defends itself against its
potent enemies as well might the hound
say to the hare use not these wily turns to
escape me but contend with me in pitched
battle as the armed and powerful heretic
demand the down trodden and oppressed
catholic to lay aside the wisdom the serpent
by which alone they may again hope
 the abbot
to raise up the jerusalem over which the
weep and which it is their duty to rebuild
but more this hereafter and now
my son i command thee on thy faith to
tell me truly and particularly what has chanced
to thee since we parted and what is
the present state thy conscience thy
relation our sister magdalen is a woman
 excellent gifts blessed with a zeal which
neither doubt nor danger can quench but
yet it is not a zeal altogether according to
knowledge wherefore ray son i would
willingly be myself thy interrogator and thy
counsellor in these days darkness and
stratagem
with the respect which he owed to his
first instructor roland graeme went rapidly
through the events which the reader is
acquainted with and while he disguised
not from the prelate the impression which
had been made on his mind by the arguments
 the preacher henderson he accidentally
and almost involuntarily gave
his father confessor to understand the inthe
abbot 
fluence which catherine seyton had acquired
over his mind
it is with joy i discover my dearest
son replied the abbot that i have arrived
in time to arrest thee on the verge 
the precipice to which thou wert approaching
these doubts which you complain
are the weeds which naturally grow up ina
strong soil and require the careful hand
 the husbandman to eradicate them thou
must study a little volume which i will
impart to thee in fitting time in which by
our lady's grace i have placed in somewhat
a clearer light than heretofore the
points debated betwixt us and these heretics
who sow among the wheat the same
tares which were formerly privily mingled
with the good seed by the albigenses and
the dollars but it is not by reason alone
that you must hope to conquer these insinuations
 the enemy it is sometimes
by timely resistance but oftener by timely
flight you must shut your ears against
the arguments the heresiarch when circe
the abbot
substances permit you not to withdraw
the foot from his company anchor your
thoughts upon the service our lady
while he is expending in vain his heretical
sophistry are you unable to maintain
your attention on heavenly objects think
rather on thine own earthly pleasures than
tempt providence and the saints by giving
an attentive ear to the erring doctrine 
think thy hawk thy hound thine anglingrod
thy sword and buckler think even
 catherine seyton rather than give thy
soul to the lessons the tempter alas my
son believe not that worn out with woes
and bent more by affliction than by years
i have forgotten the effect beauty over
the heart youth even in the watches 
the night broken by thoughts an imprisoned
queen a distracted kingdom a church
laid waste and ruinous come other thoughts
than these suggest and feelings which belonged
to an earlier and happier course 
life be it so we must bear our load as
we may j and not in vain are these passions
the abbot 
implanted in our breast since as now in
thy case they may come in aid resolutions
founded upon higher grounds yet
beware my son this catherine seyton is
the daughter one scotland's proudest
as well as most worthy barons j and thy
state may not suffer thee as yet to aspire
so high but thus it is heaven works its
purposes through human folly and douglas's
ambitious affection as well as thine
shall contribute alike to the desired 
 how my father said the page my
suspicions are then true douglas loves 
 he does and with a love as much
misplaced as thine own j but beware him
cross him not thwart him not
let him not cross or thwart me said
the page for i will not yield him an
inch way had he in his body the soul 
every douglas that has lived since the time
 the dark grey man
nay have patience idle boy and re
fleet that your suit can never interfere with
his a truce with these vanities and let us
 the abbot
better employ the little space which it still
remains to us to spend together to thy
knees my son and resume the long interrupted
duty confession that happen
what may the hour may find in thee a faithful
catholic relieved from the guilt his
sins by authority the holy church could
i but tell thee roland the joy with which
i see thee once more put thy knee to its
best and fittest use quid dicis mi fill 
culpas easy answered the youth and
according to the ritual the catholic
church he confessed and received absolution
to which was annexed the condition
 performing certain enjoined penances
when this religious ceremony was ended
an old man in the dress a peasant 
the better order approached the arbour
and greeted the abbot i have waited
the conclusion your devotions he said
 to tell you the youth is sought after by
the chamberlain and it were well he were
to appear without delay holy saint francis
if the halberdiers were to seek him here
the abbot 
they might sorely wrong my gardenplot 
they are in office and reck not where they
tread were each step on jessamine and
clovecauliflowers
 we will speed him forth my brother
said the abbot but alas is it possible
that such trifles should live in your mind
at a crisis so awful as that which is now impending

 reverend father answered the proprietor
 the garden for such he was how
oft shall i pray you to keep your high counsel
for high minds like your own what
have you required me that i have not
granted unresisting though with a sore
heart r
 i would require you to be yourself
my brother said the abbot ambrosius 
 to remember what you were and to what
your early vows have bound you
i tell thee father ambrosius replied
the gardener the patience the best
saint that ever said paternoster would be
exhausted by the trials to which you have
c 
 the abbot
put mine what i have been it skills not
to speak at present no one knows better
than yourself father what i renounced
in hopes to find ease and quiet during the
remainder my days and no one better
knows how my retreat has been invaded
my fruittrees broken my flowerbeds
trodden down my quiet frightened away
and my very sleep driven from my bed
since ever this poor queen god bless
her hath been sent to lochleven i blame
her not j being a prisoner it is natural she
should wish to get out from so vile a hold
where there is scarce any place even for a
tolerable garden and where the watermists
as i am told blight all the early blossoms
 i say i cannot blame her for endeavouring
for her freedom but why i should be
drawn into the scheme why my harmless
arbours that i planted with my own hands
should become places privy conspiracy
why my little quay which i built for my
own fishing boat should have become a haven
for secret embarkations in short why
the abbot 
i should be dragged into matters where
both heading and hanging are like to bethe
issue i profess to you reverend father
i am totally ignorant
my brother answered the abbot
you are wise and ought to know
i am not i am not i am not wise
replied the horticulturist pettishly and
stopping his ears with his fingers i was
never called wise but when men wanted
to engage me in some action notorious
folly
 but my good brother said the abbots

 am not good neither said the gardener
 i am neither good nor wise had
i been wise you would not have been admitted
here and were i good methinks 
would send you elsewhere to hatch plots
for destroying the quiet the country
what signifies disputing about queen or
king when men may sit at peace sui uniira
viris sui and so would i do after the
precept holy writ were i as you term
 the abbot
me wise or good but such as i am my
neck is in the yoke and you make me draw
what weight you list follow me youngster
this reverend father who makes in his
jackman's dress nearly as reverend a figure
as i myself will agree with me in one thing
at least and that is that you have been
long enough here
 follow the good father roland said
the abbot and remember my words a
day is approaching that will try the temper
 all true scotsmen may thy heart prove
faithful as the steel thy blade 
the page bowed in silence and they parted
 the gardener notwithstanding his advanced
age walking on before him very
briskly and muttering as he went partly to
himself partly to his companion after the
manner old men weakened intellects 
 when i was great thus run his maundering
 and had my mule and my ambling
palfrey at command i warrant you
i could have as well flown through the
hair as have walked at this pace i had my
the abbot l
gout and my rheumatics and an hundred
things beside that hung fetters on my
heels and now thanks to our lady and
honest labour i can walk with any goodman
 my age in the kingdom fife 
fie upon it that experience should be so
long in coming
as he was thus muttering his eye fell
upon the branch a pear tree which drooped
down for want support and at once
forgetting his haste the old man stopped
and set seriously about binding it up roland
graeme had both readiness neatness
 hand and good nature in abundance 
he immediately lent his aid and in a minute
or two the bough was supported and
tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to
the old man who looked at it with great
complaisance they are bargains he
said and if you will come ashore in
autumn you shall taste them the like
are not in lochleven castle the garden
there is a poor pinfold and the gardener
hugh oakham hath little skill his
 the abbot
craft come ashore master page in autumn
when you would eat pears but what
am i thinking ere that time come they
may have given thee sour pears for plums
take an old man's advice youth one who
hath seen many days and sat in higher
places than thou canst hope for bend thy
sword into a pruninghook and make a
dibble thy dagger thy days shall be the
longer and thy health the better for it and
come to aid me in my garden and i will
teach thee the real french fashion imp
whig which the southron call grafting do
this and do it without loss time for there
is a whirlwind coming over the land and
only those shall escape who lie too much beneath
the storm to have their boughs broken
by it
so saying he dismissed roland greene
through a door different from that by which
he had enteredjsigned a cross and pronounced
a benedicite as they parted and then
still muttering to himself retired into the
garden and locked the door on the inside
the abbot 
chapter iii
pray god she prove not masculine ere long 
king henry 
dismissed from the old man's garden roland
graeme found that a grassy paddock
in which sauntered two cows the property
 the gardener still separated him from
the village he paced through it lost in
meditation upon the words the abbot
father ambrosius had vith success enough
exerted over him that reverential influence
which the guardians and instructors our
childhood possess over our more mature
youth and yet when roland looked back
upon what the father had said he could
not but suspect that he had rather sought
to evade entering into the controversy beck
the abbot
twixt the churches than to repel the objections
and satisfy the doubts which the
lectures henderson had excited for
this he had no time said the page to
himself neither have i now calmness and
learning sufficient to judge upon points
 such magnitude besides it were base
to quit my faith while the wind fortune
sets against it unless i were so placed
that my conversion should it take place
were free as light from the imputation 
self interest i was bred a catholic bredin
the faith bruce and wallace i will
hold that faith till time and reason shall
convince me that it errs i will serve this
poor queen as a subject should serve an imprisoned
and wronged sovereign they wha
placed me in her service have to blame themselves
 they sent me hither a gentleman
trained in the paths loyalty and honour
when they should have sought out some
truckling cogging doubledealing knave
who would have been at once the observant
page the queen and the obsequious spy
the abbot 
 her enemies since i must chuse betwixt
aiding and betraying her i will decide
as becomes her servant and her subject
j but catherine seyton catherine
seyton beloved by douglas and holding
me on or off as the intervals her leisure
or caprice will permit how shall i deal
with the coquette by heaven when i
next have an opportunity she shall render
me some reason for her conduct or i will
break with her for ever
as he formed this doughty resolution he
crossed the stile which led out the little
enclosure and was almost immediately
greeted by dr luke lundin
ha my most excellent young friend
said the doctor from whence come you 
but i note the place yes neighbour
blinkhoolie's garden is a pleasant rendezvous
and you are the age when lads look
after a bonny lass with one eye and a dainty
plum with another but hey i you look
sub tri stand melancholic i fear the maiden
has proved cruel or the plums unripe j and
 the abbot
surely think neighbour blinkhoolie's damsons
can scarce have been well preserved
throughout the winter he spares the saccharine
juice on his confects but courage
man there are more rates in kinross and
for the immature fruit a glass my double
distilled aqua nirahilisprohattim est
the page darted an ireful glance at the
facetious physician but presently recollecting
that the name kate which had provoked
his displeasure was probably but introduced
for the sake alliteration he suppressed
his wrath and only asked if the
pains had been heard 
 why i have been seeking for you this
hour to tell you that the stuff is in your
boat and that the boat waits your pleasure
auchtermuchty had only fallen into company
with an idle knave like himself and a
stoup aquavitas between them your
boatmen lie on their oars and there have
already been made two wets from the warder's
turret to intimate that those in the
castle are impatient for your return yet
the abbot 
there is time for you to take a slight repast 
and as your friend and physician i hold it
unfit you should face the waterbreeze with
an empty stomach
roland graeme had nothing for it but to
return with such cheer as he might to the
place where his boat was moored on the
beach and resisted all offer refreshment
although the doctor promised that he should
prelude the collation with a gentle appe
tierra decoction herbs gathered and
distilled by himself indeed as roland had
not forgotten the contents his morning
cup it is possible that the recollection induced
him to stand firm in his refusal all
food to which such an unpalatable 
was to be annexed as they passed towards
the boat for the ceremonious politeness
 the worthy chamberlain would not
permit the page to go thither without attendance
roland graeme amidst a group who
seemed to be assembled around a party 
wandering musicians distinguished as he
 the abbot
thought the dress catherine seyton he
shook himself clear from his attendant and
at one spring was in the midst the crowd
and at the side the damsel catherine
he whispered is it well for you to
be still here will you not return to the
castle 
to the devil with your catherine and
your castles answered the maiden snappishly
 have you not had time enough already
to get rid your follies begone i
desire not your farther company and there
will be danger in thrusting it upon me
nay but if there be danger fairest
catherine replied roland why will you
not allow me to stay and share it with you 
intruding fool said the maiden the
danger is all on thine own side the risk
is in plain terms that i strike thee on the
mouth with the hilt my dagger so saying
she turned haughtily from him and
moved through the crowd who gave way
in some astonishment at the masculine acthe
abbot 
activity with which she forced her way among
them
as roland though much irritated prepared
to follow he was grappled on the
other side by doctor luke lundin who
reminded him the loaded boat the two
wets or signals with the flag which had
been made from the tower the danger 
the cold breeze to an empty stomach and
 the vanity spending more time upon
coy wenches and sour plums roland was
thus in a manner dragged back to his
boat and obliged to launch her forth upon
his return to lochleven castle
that little voyage was speedily accomplished
and the page was greeted at the
landingplace by the severe and caustic welcome
 old dryfesdale so young gallant
you are come at last after a delay 
six hours and after two signals from the
castle but i warrant some idle upsetting
had occupied you too deeply to think 
your service or your duty where is the
note the plate and household stuff 
 the abbot
pray heaven it hath not been diminished
under the sleeveless care so young a gadabout

 diminished under my care sir steward
 retorted the page angrily say soin
earnest and by heaven your grey hair
shall hardly protect your saucy tongue 
 a truce with your swaggering young
esquire returned the steward we have
bolts and dungeons for brawlers go to my
lady and swagger before her if thou darest
 she will give thee proper cause 
offence for she has waited thee long and
impatiently
 and where then is the lady lochleven
 said the page for i conceive it
is her thou speaks
 ay whom else replied clydesdale
 or who besides the lady lochleven
hath a right to command in this castle

the lady lochleven is thy mistress
said roland graeme i but mine is
the queen scotland
the abbot 
the steward looked at him fixedly for a
moment with an air in which suspicion and
dislike were ill concealed by an affectation
 contempt the bragging cockchicken
he said will betray himself by his hath
crowing i have marked thy changed manner
in the chapel late ay and your
changing glances at mealtime with a
certain idle damsel who like thyself laughs
at all gravity and goodness there is something
about you my master which should
be looked to but if you would know
whether heady lochleven or that other
lady hath right to command thy service
thou wilt find them together in the lady
mary's antiroom
roland hastened thither not unwilling to
escape from the illnatured penetration 
the old man and marvelling at the same time
what peculiarity could have occasioned the
lady lochleven's being in the queen's
apartment at this time the afternoon so
much contrary to her usual wont his
 the abbot
acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning
she wishes he concluded to see the
meeting betwixt the queen and me on my
return that she may form a guess whether
there is any private intelligence or understanding
betwixt us i must be guarded
with this resolution he entered the parlour
where the queen seated in her chair
with the lady fleming leaning upon the
back it had already kept the lady 
lochleven standing in her presence for the
space nearly an hour to the manifest increase
 her very visible bad humour roland
graeme on entering the apartment
made a deep obeisance to the queen and another
to the lady and then stood still as if to
await their further question speaking almost
together the lady lochleven said
 so young man you are returned at
length 
and then stopped indignantly short
while the queen went on without regarding
her roland you are welcome home
the abbot 
to us you have proved the true dove and
not the raven yet i am sure i could have
forgiven you if once dismissed from this
water circled ark ours you had never
again returned to us i trust you have
brought back an olive branch for our kind
and worthy hostess has chafed herself much
on account your long absence and we
never needed more some symbol peace
and reconciliation
 i grieve i should have been detained
madam answered the page but from the
delay the person entrusted with the matters
for which i was sent i did not receive
them till late in the day
 see you there now said the queen
to the lady lochleven we could not
persuade you our dearest hostess that your
household goods were in all safe keeping
and surety true it is that we can excuse
your anxiety considering that these august
apartments are so scantily furnished that
we have not been able to offer you even the
vol iii d
 the abbot
relief a stool during the long time you
have afforded us the pleasure your society

 the will madam said the lady
 the will to offer such accommodation was
more wanting than the means
 what said the queen looking round
and affecting surprise there are then
stools in this apartment one two no less
than four including the broken one a royal
garniture we observed them not will it
please your ladyship to sit 
 no madam i will soon relieve you 
my presence replied the lady lochleven 
 and while with you my aged limbs can
still better brook fatigue than my mind
stoop to accept constrained courtesy
 nay lady lochleven if you take
it so deeply said the queen rising and
motioning to her own vacant chair i
would rather you assumed my seat you
are not the first your family who has done
so

the abbot 
the lady lochleven curtsied a negative
but seemed with much difficulty to
suppress the angry answer which rose to her
lips
during this sharp conversation the page's
attention had been almost entirely occupied
by the entrance catherine seyton
who came from the inner apartment in the
usual dress in which she attended upon the
queen and with nothing in her manner
which marked either the hurry or confusion
incident to a hasty change disguise or
the conscious fear detection in a perilous
enterprize roland giseme ventured to
make her an obeisance as she entered but
she returned it with an air the utmost indifference
which in his opinion was extremely
inconsistent with the circumstances
in which they stood towards each other
surely he thought she cannot in reason
expect to bully me out the belief
due to mine own eyes as she tried to do
concerning the apparition in the hostelry 
saint michael's i will try if i cannot make
 the abbot
her feel that this will be but a vain task
and that confidence in me is the wiser and
safer course to pursue
thesethoughts had passed rapidly through
his mind when the queen having finished
her altercation with the lady the castle
again addressed him what the revels
at kinross roland grasme methought
they were gay if i may judge from some
faint sounds mirth and distant music
which found their way so far as these grated
windows and died when they entered them
as all that is mirthful must but thou lookest
as sad as if thou hadst come from a conventicle
 the huguenots 
and so perchance he hath madam
replied the lady lochleven at whom
this sideshaft was launched i trust amid
yonder idle fooleries there wanted not some
pouring forth doctrine to a better purpose
than that vain mirth which blazing
and vanishing like the crackling dry
thorns leaves to the fools who love it nothing
but dust and ashes
the abbot 
 mary fleming said the queen turning
round and drawing her mantle around
her i would that we had the chimneygrate
supplied with a faggot or two these
same thorns which the lady lochleven
describes so well methinks the damp air
from the lake which stagnates in these
vaulted rooms renders them deadly cold
your grace's pleasure shall be obeyed
said the lady lochleven yet may i
presume to remind you that we are now in
summer 
i thank you for the information my
good lady said the queen for prisoners
better learn their calendar from the mouth
 their jailor than from any change they
themselves feel in the seasons once more
roland grme what the revels 
 they were gay madam said the page
 but the usual sort and little worth your
highness's ear
 o you know not said the queen
how very indulgent my ear has become
s the abbot
to all that speaks freedom and the pleasures
 the free methinks i would rather
have seen the gay villagers dance their
ring round the maypole than have witnessed
the most stately masques within the
walls a palace the absence stonewalls
 the sense that the green turf is under
the foot which may tread it free and
unrestrained is worth all that art or splendour
can add to more courtly revels
i trust said the lady lochleven addressing
the page in her turn there were
amongst these follies none the riots or
disturbances to which they so naturally
lead 
roland gave a slight glance to catherine
seyton as if to bespeak her attention as he
replied i witnessed no offence madam
worthy marking none indeed any
kind save that a bold damsel made her hand
somewhat too familiar with the cheek a
playerman and ran some hazard being
ducked in the lake
the arbor 
as he uttered these words he cast a hasty
glance at catherine but she sustained with
the utmost serenity manner and countenance
the hint which he had deemed could
not have been thrown out before her without
exciting some fear and confusion
 i will cumber your grace no longer
with my presence said the lady cochlea
 unless you have aught to command
me
 nought our good hostess answered
the queen unless it be to pray you that
on another occasion you deem it not needful
to postpone your better employment to
wait so long upon us
 may it please you added the lady
lochleven to command this your gentleman
to attend us that may receive some
account these matters which have been
sent hither for your grace's use
we may not refuse what you are pleased
to require madam answered the queen
 go with the lady roland if our como
the abbot
hands be indeed necessary to thy doing so
we will hear tomorrow the history thy
kinross pleasures for this night we dismiss
thy attendance
roland graeme went with the lady 
lochleven who failed not to ask him many
questions concerning what had passed at
the sports to which he rendered such answers
as were most likely to lull asleep any
suspicions which she might entertain his
disposition to favour queen mary taking
especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition
 magdalen graeme and the
abbot ambrosius at length after undergoing
a long and somewhat close examination
he was dismissed with such expressions
as coming from the reserved and
stern lady lochleven might seem to
express a degree favour and countenance
his first care was to obtain some refreshment
which was more cheerfully afforded
him by a goodnatured panther than by
dryfesdale who was on this occasion much
the abbot 
disposed to abide by the fashion 
house where
they who came not the first call
gat no more meat till the next meal
when roland graeme had finished his
repast having his dismissal from the queen
for the evening and being little inclined
for such society as the castle afforded he
stole into the garden in vhich he had permission
to spend his leisure time when it
pleased him in this place the ingenuity
 the contriver and disposer the walks
had exerted itself to make the most little
space and by screens both stone ornamented
with rude sculpture and hedges 
living green had endeavoured to give as
much intricacy and variety as the confined
limits the garden would admit
here the young man walked sadly considering
the events the day and comparing
what had dropped from the abbot
with what he had himself noticed the
demeanour george douglas it must
be so was the painful but inevitable con

 the abbot
elusion at which he arrived it must be
by his aid that she is thus enabled like a
phantom to transport herself from place
to place and to appear at pleasure on the
mainland or on the islet it must be so
he repeated once more j with him she
holds a close secret and intimate correspondence
altogether inconsistent with the
eye favour which she has sometimes
cast upon me and destructive to the hopes
which she must have known these glances
have necessarily inspired and yet for
love will hope where reason despairs the
thought rushed on his mind that it was possible
she only encouraged douglas's passion
so far as might serve her mistress's interest
and that she was too frank noble and
candid a nature to hold out to himself hopes
which she meant not to fulfil lost in these
various conjectures he seated himself upon
a bank turf which commanded a view
 the lake on the one side and on the other
 that front the castle amongst which the
queen's apartments were situated
the abbot 
the sun had now for some time set and
the twilight may was rapidly fading into
a serene night on the lake the expanded
water rose and fell with the slightest and
softest influence a southern breeze which
scarcely dimpled the surface over which it
passed in the distance was still seen the
dim outline the island saint serf once
visited by many a sandalled pilgrim as the
blessed spot trodden by a man god 
now neglected or violated as the refuge 
lazy priests who had with justice been compelled
to give place to the sheep and the
heifers a protestant baron
as roland gazed on the dark speck
amid the lighter blue the waters which
surrounded it the mazes polemical discussion
again stretched themselves before the
eye his mind had these men justly suffered
their exile as licentious drones the
robbers at once and disgrace the busy
hive or had the hand avarice and rapine
expelled from the temple not the 
the abbot
balls who polluted but the faithful priests
who served the shrine in honour and fidelity
i the arguments henderson in this
contemplative hour rose with double force
before him and could scarce be parried by
the appeal which the abbot ambrosius
had made from his understanding to his
feelings an appeal which he had felt more
forcibly amid the bustle stirring yit'e
than it now seemed to his more undisturbed
reflection it required an effort to
divert his mind from this embarrassing topic
 and he found that he best succeeded
by turning his eyes to the front the
tower watching where a twinkling light
still streamed from the casement catherine
seyton's apartment obscured by times
for a moment as the shadow the fair
inhabitant passed betwixt the taper and
the window at length the light was removed
or extinguished and that object 
speculation was also withdrawn from the
eyes the meditative lover dare i cones
the abbot 
fessthe fact without injuring his character
for ever as a hero romance these eyes
gradually became heavy speculative doubts
on the subject religious controversy and
anxious conjectures concerning the state 
his mistress's affections became confusedly
blended together in his musings the fatigues
 a busy day prevailed over the harassing
subjects contemplation which occupied
his mind and he fell fast asleep
sound were his slumbers until they were
suddenly dispelled by the iron tongue the
castle bell which sent its deep and sullen
sounds wide over the bosom the lake and
awakened the echoes bennarty the hill
which descends steeply on its southern bank
roland started up for this bell was always
tolled at ten o'clock as the signal for locking
the castle gates and placing the keys
under the charge the seneschal he therefore
hastened to the wicket by which the
garden communicated with the building
and had the mortification just as he reached
the abbot
ed it to hear the bolt leave its sheath with
a discordant crash and enter the stone
groove the doorjinteh
 hold hold cried the page and let
me in ere you lock the wicket
the voice dryfesdale replied from
within in his usual tone embittered sullenness
 the hour is passed fair master
you like not the inside these walls 
even make it a complete holiday and pass
the night as well as the day out bounds
open the door exclaimed the indignant
page or by saint giles i will make
thy gold chain smoke for it 
make no alarm here retorted the impenetrable
dryfesdale but keep thy sinful
oaths and silly threats for those that regard
them i do mine office and carry the
keys to the seneschal adieu my young
master the cool night air will advantage
your hot blood
the steward was right in what he said 
for the cooling breeze was very necessary
to appease the feverish fit anger which
the abbot 
roland experienced nor did the remedy
succeed for some time at length after
some hasty turns made through the garden
exhausting his passion in vain vows vengeance
roland graeme began to be sensible
that his situation ought rather to beheld
as matter laughter than serious
resentment to one bred a sportsman a
night spent in the open air had in it little
 hardship and the poor malice the
steward seemed more worthy his contempt
than his anger i would to god he
said that the grim old man may always have
contented himself with such sportive revenge
he often looks as he were capable
 doing us a darker turn returning therefore
to the turfseat which he had formerly
occupied and which was partially sheltered
by a trim fence green holly he drew his
mantle around him stretched himself at
length on the verdant settle and endeavoured
to resume that sleep which the 
had interrupted to so little purpose
sleep like other earthly blessings is nigh
the abbot
gard its favours when most courted the
more roland invoked her aid the further
she fled from his eyelids he had been
completely awakened first by the sounds 
the bell and then by his own aroused vivacity
 temper and he found it difficult
again to compose himself to slumber at
length when his mind was wearied out with
a maze unpleasing meditation he succeeded
in coaxing himself into a broken
slumber this was again dispelled by the
voices two persons who were walking
in the garden the sound whose conversation
after mingling for some time in
the page's dreams at length succeeded
in awaking him thoroughly he raised
himself from his reclining posture in the
utmost astonishment which the circumstance
 hearing two persons at that late
hour conversing on the outside the
watchfully guarded castle lochleyen
was so well calculated to excite his first
thought was upon supernatural beings his
next upon some attempt on the part 
the abbot 
queen mary's friends and followers his last
was that george douglas possessed 
the keys and having the means ingress
and egress at pleasure was availing himself
 his office to hold a rendezvous with catherine
seyton in the castle garden he
was confirmed in this opinion by the tone
 the voice which asked in a low whispers
whether all was ready
 the abbot
chapter 
la some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent
like war's swart powder in a castlevault
until occasion like the linstock lights it 
then comes at once the lightning and the thunder 
and distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder
old play
roland grme availing himself a
breach in the holy screen and the assistance
 the full moon which was now
arisen had a perfect opportunity himself
unobserved to reconnoitre the persons and
the motions those by whom his rest had
been thus unexpectedly disturbed and his
observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions
they stood together in close and
earnest conversation within four yards 
the place his retreat and he could easily
recognize the tall form and deep voice 
the abbot 
douglas and the no less remarkable dress
and tone the page at the hostelry saint
michael's
 i have been at the door the page's
apartment said douglas but he is not
there or he will not answer it is fast bolted
on the inside as is the custom and we
cannot pass through it and what his silence
may bode i know not
you have trusted him too far said the
other a featherheaded coxcomb uxoris
whose changeable mind and hot brain there
is no making an abiding impression
it was not i who was willing to trust
him said douglas j but i was assured he
would prove friendly when called upon
for here he spoke so low that roland
lost the tenor his words which was the
more provoking as he was fully aware
that he was himself the subject their
conversation
nay replied the stranger more aloud
 i have on my side put him off with fail
 the abbot
words which make fools fain but now if
you distrust him at the push deal with him
with your dagger and so make open passage

 that were too rash said douglas 
and besides as i told you the door his
apartment is shut and bolted will essay
again to waken him
gramme instantly comprehended that the
ladies having been somehow made aware 
his being in the garden had secured the
door the outer room in which he usually
slept as a sort sentinel upon that only
access to the queen's apartments but then
how came catherine seyton to be abroad if
the queen and the other lady were still
within their chambers and the access to
them locked and bolted i will be instantly
at the bottom these mysteries
he said and then thank mrs catherine if
this be really she for the kind use which
she exhorted douglas to make his dagger
they seek me as i comprehend and they
shall not seek me in vain
the abbot 
douglas had by this time reentered the
castle by the wicket which was now open
the stranger stood alone in the garden walk
his arms folded on his breast and his eyes
cast impatiently up to the moon as if accusing
her betraying him by the magnificence
 her lustre in a moment roland
graeme stood before him a goodly
night he said mrs catherine for a
young lady to stray forth in disguise and
to meet with men in an orchard
 hush said the stranger page hush
thou foolish patch and tell us in a word
if thou art friend or foe
 how should i be friend to one who
deceives me by fair words and who would
have douglas deal with me with his poniard
 replied roland
the fiend receive george douglas
and thee too thou born madcap and sworn
marplot said the other we shall be discovered
and then death is the word
catherine said the page you have
dealt falsely and cruelly with me and the
 the abbot
moment explanation is now come neither
it nor you shall escape me
 madman said the stranger i am
neither kate nor catherine the moon
shines bright enough surely to know the
hart from the hind
that shift shall not serve you fair mistress
said the page laying hold on the lap
 the stranger's cloak this time at least
i will know with whom i deal
 unhand me said she endeavouring
to extricate herself from his grasp and in a 
tone where anger seemed to contend with
a desire to laugh use you so little discretion
towards a daughter seyton 
but as roland encouraged perhaps by
her risibility to suppose his violence was
not unpardonably offensive kept hold on
her mantle she said in a sterner tone 
vmraixed resentment madman let me
go there is life and death in this moment
i would not willingly hurt thee and yet
beware 
as she spoke she made a sudden effort
the abbot 
to escape and in doing so a pistol which
she carried in her hand or about her person
went off
this warhke sound instantly awakened
the well warded castle the warder blew
his horn and began to toll the castlebell
crying out at the same time fie treason 
treason cry all cry all 
the apparition catherine seyton
which the page had let loose in the first
moment astonishment vanished in darkness
but the plash oars was heard and
in a second or two five or six harquebusses
and a falconet were fired from the battlements
 the castle successively as if levelled
at some object on the water confounded
with these incidents no way for catherine's
protection supposing her to be in
the boat which he had heard put from the
shore occurred to roland save to have
recourse to george douglas he hastened
for this purpose towards the apartment
 the queen whence he heard loud
voices and much trampling feet when
 the abbot
he entered he found himself added to a
confused and astonished group which assembled
in that apartment stood gazing
upon each other at the upper the
room stood the queen equipped as for a
journey and attended not only by the lady
fleming but by the omnipresent catherine
seyton dressed in the habit her own sex
and bearing in her hand the casket in which
mary kept such jewels as she had been permitted
to retain at the other the
hall was the lady lochleven hastily
dressed as one startled from slumber by the
sudden alarm and surrounded by domestics
some bearing torches others holding naked
swords partizans pistols or such other
weapons as they had caught up in the hurry
 a night alarm betwixt these two parties
stood george douglas his arms folded
on his breast his eyes bent on the ground
like a criminal who knows not how to deny
yet continues unwilling to avow the
guilt in which he has been detected
the abbot 
 speak george douglas said the
lady lochleven speak and clear the
horrid suspicion which rests on thy name
say a douglas was never faithless to his
trust and i am a douglas say this my
dearest son and it is all i ask thee to say
to clear thy name even under such a foul
charge say it was but the wile these
unhappy women and this false boy which
plotted an escape so fatal to scotland so
destructive to thy father's house
 madam said old dryfesdale the steward
 this much do i say for this silly page
that he could not be accessary to unlocking
the doors since i myself this night bolted
him out the castle whoever limned
this nightpiece the lad's share in it seems
to have been small
thou lies dryfesdale said the lady
and wouldst throw the blame on thy master's
house to save the worthless life a
gipsey boy
his death were more desirable to me
vol iii e
 the abbot
than his life answered the steward sullenly
 but the truth is the truth
at these words douglas raised his head
drew up his figure to its full height and
spoke boldly and sedately as one whose resolution
was taken let no life be endangered
for me i alone
douglas said the queen interrupting
him art thou mad speak not i
charge you
 madam he replied bowing with the
deepest respect gladly would i obey your
commands but they must have a victim
and let it be the true one yes madam he
continued addressing the lady lochleven
 i alone am guilty in this matter if
the word a douglas has yet any weight
with you believe me that this boy is innocent
 and on your conscience i charge you
do him no wrong nor let the queen suffer
hardship for embracing the opportunity 
freedom which sincere loyalty which a
sentiment yet deeper offered to her acceptance
yes i had planned the escape
the abbot 
 the most beautiful the most persecuted
 women and far from regretting that i
for a while deceived the malice her enemies
i glory in it and am most willing to
yield up life itself in her cause
 now may god have comfort on my
age said the lady lochleven and
enable me to bear this load affliction o
princess born in a luckless hour when will
you cease to be the instrument seduction
and ruin to all who approach you 
o ancient house lochleven famed so
long for birth and honour evil was the hour
brought the deceiver under thy roof
 say not so madam replied her grandson
 the old honours the douglas line
will be outshone when one its descendants
dies for the most injured queens 
for the most lovely women
douglas said the queen must i at
this moment ay even at this moment
when i may lose a faithful subject for ever
chide thee for forgetting what is due to roe
as thy queen 
loo the abbot
wretched boy said the distracted
lady lochleven hast thou fallen even
thus far into the snare this moabitish
woman hast thou bartered thy name thy
allegiance thy knightly oath thy duty to
thy parents thy country and thy god fora
feigned tear or a sickly smile from lips
which flattered the infirm francis lured to
death the idiot darnley read luscious poetry
with the minion chastest mingled in
the lays love which were sung by the
beggar rizzio and which were joined in
rapture to those the foul and licentious
bothwell 
 blaspheme not madam said douglas 
nor you fair queen and virtuous as fair
chide at this moment the presumption 
thy vassal think not that the mere devotion
 a subject could have moved me to
the part i have been performing well you
deserve that each your lieges should die
for you but i have done more have done
that to which love alone could compel a
douglas i have dissembled farewell then
the abbot 
queen all hearts and empress that 
douglas when you are freed from this
vile bondage as freed you shall be if justice
remains in heaven and when you load
with honours and titles the happy man who
shall deliver you cast one thought on him
whose heart would have despised every reward
for a kiss your hand cast one
thought on his fidelity and drop one tear
on his grave and throwing himself at her
feet he seized her hand and pressed it to
his lips
this before my face said the lady 
lochlevenvwilt thou court thy adulterous
paramour before the eyes a parent tear
them asunder and put him under strict
ward seize him upon your lives she added
seeing that her attendants looked on
each other with hesitation
 they are doubtful said mary save
thyself douglas i command thee 
he started up from the floor and only
exclaiming my life or death are yours
 the abbot
and at your disposal drew his sword
and broke through those who stood betwixt
him and the door the enthusiasm his
onset was too sudden and too lively to have
been opposed by any thing short the
most decided opposition and as he was
both loved and feared by his father's vassals
none them would offer him actual injury
the lady lochleven stood astonished
at his sudden escape am i surrounded
she said by traitors upon him villains
pursue stab cut him down 
he cannot leave the island madam
said dryfesdale interfering i have the
key the boatchain
but two or three voices those who
pursued from curiosity or command their
mistress exclaimed from below that he had
cast himself into the lake
 brave douglas still exclaimed the
queen o true and noble heart that
prefers death to imprisonment 
 fire upon him said the lady lochthe
abbot 
leven if there be here a true servant 
his father let him shoot the runagate dead
and let the lake cover our shame 
the report a gun or two were heard
but they were probably shot rather to obey
the lady than with any purpose hitting
the mark and randal immediately entering
said that master george had been
taken up by a boat from the castle which
lay at a little distance
man a barge and pursue them said
the lady
 it were quite vain said randal by
this time they are half way to shore and a
cloud has come over the moon
 and has the traitor then escaped 
said the lady pressing her hands against
her forehead with a gesture despair 
the honour our house is for ever gone
and all will be deemed accomplices in this
base treachery
 lady lochleven said mary advancing
towards her you have this night cutoff
my fairest hopes you have turned my
 the abbot
expected freedom into bondage and dashed
away the cup joy in the very instant
i was advancing it to my lips and yet i
feel for your sorrow the pity that you deny
to mine gladly would i comfort you
if i might but as i may not i would at
least part from you in charity
 away proud woman said the lady 
 who ever knew so well as thou to deal
the deepest wounds under the pretence 
kindness and courtesy who since the
great traitor could ever so betray with a
kiss
lady douglas lochleven said the
queen in this moment thou canst not
offend me no not even by thy coarse
and unwomanly language held to me in
the presence menials and armed retainers
i have this night owed so much to
one member the house lochleven as
to cancel whatever its mistress can do or
say in the wildness her passion
we are bounden to you princess said
lady lochleven putting a strong constraint
the abbot 
on herself and passing from her tone violence
to that bitter irony ourpoorhouse
hath been but seldom graced with royal
smiles and will hardly with my choice exchange
their rough honesty for such courthonour
as mary scotland has now to
bestow
 they replied mary who knew so
well how to take may think themselves excused
from the obligation implied in receiving
and that i have now little to offer is
the fault the douglasseses and their allies
fear nothing madam replied the lady
 lochleven in the same bitter tone
 you retain an exchequer which neither
your own prodigality can drain nor your
offended country deprive you while you
have fair words and delusive smiles at command
you need no other bribes to lure
youth to folly
the queen cast a not ungratified glance
on a large mirror which hanging on one
side the apartment and illuminated by
the torchlight reflected her beautiful face
e 
 the abbot
and person our hostess grows complaisant
she said my fleming we had not
thought that grief and captivity had left us
so well stored with that sort wealth which
ladies prize most dearly
 your grace will drive this severe woman
frantic said fleming in a low tone
 on my knees i implore you to remember
she is already dreadfully offended and that
we are in her power
i will not spare her fleming answered
the queen it is against my nature
she returned my honest sympathy with insult
and abuse and i will gall her in return
if her words are too blunt for answer let
her use her poniard if she dare
the lady lochleven said the lady
fleming aloud would surely do well now
to withdraw and to leave her grace to repose

 ay replied the lady or to leave her
grace and her grace's minions to think
what silly fly they may next wrap their
meshes about my eldest son is a widower
the abbot 
were he not more worthy the flattering
hopes with which you have seduced his brother
 true the yoke marriage has been
already thrice fitted on but the church 
rome calls it a sacrament and its votaries
may deem it one in which they cannot too
often participate
 and the votaries the church geneva
replied mary colouring with indignation
 as they deem marriage no sacrament
are said at times to dispense with the
holy ceremony then as if afraid the
consequences this home allusion to the
errors lady lochleven's early life the
queen added come my fleming we
grace her too much by this altercation we
will to our sleeping apartment if she would
disturb us again tonight she must cause
the door to be forced so saying she retired
to her bedroom followed by her two
women
lady lochleven stunned as it were by
this last sarcasm and not the less deeply
incensed that she had drawn it upon heros
the abbot
self remained like a statue on the spatwhich
she had occupied when she received an
affront so flagrant dryfesdale and randal
endeavoured to rouse her to recollection
by questions
 what is your honourable ladyship's
pleasure in the premises 
shall we not double the sentinels and
place one upon the boats and another in
the garden said randal
 would you that dispatches were sent
to sir william at edinburgh to acquaint
him with what has happened demanded
dryfesdale and ought not the place 
kinross to be alarmed lest there be force
upon the shores the lake 
do all as thou wilt said the lady collecting
herself and about to depart thou
hast the name a good soldier dryfesdale
take all precautions sacred heaven that
i should be thus openly upbraided 
 would it be your pleasure said clydesdale
hesitating that this person this
lady be more severely restrained 
the abbot 
 no vassal answered the lady indignantly
 my revenge stoops not to such a
low gratification but i will have more
worthy vengeance or the tomb my ancestors
shall cover my shame
and you shall have it madam replied
dryfesdale ere two suns go down you
shall term yourself amply revenged
the lady made no answer perhaps did
not hear his words as she presently left the
apartment by the command dryfesdale
the rest the attendants were dismissed
some to do the duty guard others to
their repose the steward himself remained
after they had all departed and roland
grseme who was alone in the apartment
was surprised to see the old soldier advance
towards him with an air greater cordiality
than he had ever before assumed towards
him but which sat ill on his scowling features

 youth he said i have done thee
some wrong it is thine own fault for thy
behaviour hath seemed as light to me as
 the abbot
the feather thou dearest in thy hat and
surely thy fantastic apparel and idle humour
 mirth and folly have made me
construe thee something harshly but i
saw this night from my casement as i
looked out to see how thou hadst disposed
 thyself in the garden i saw i say the
true efforts which thou didst make to detain
the companion the perfidy him
who is no longer worthy to be called by
his father's name but must be cut oft from
his house like a rotten branch i was just
about to come to thy assistance when the
pistol went oft and the warder a false
knave whom i suspect to be bribed for the
nonce saw himself forced to give the alarm
which perchance till then he had wilfully
withheld to atone therefore for my injustice
towards you i would willingly render
you a courtesy if you would accept 
it from my hands
 may i first crave to know what it is
replied the page
simply to carry the news this discothe
abbot ill
very to holyrood where thou mayest do
thyself much grace as well with the earl
 morton and the regent himself as with
sir william douglas seeing thou hast seen
the matter from to and borne faithful
part therein the making thine own
fortune will be thus lodged in thine own
hand when i trust thou wilt estrange thyself
from foolish vanities and learn to walk
in this world as one who thinks upon the
next
 sir steward said roland graeme i
thank you for your courtesy but i may not
do your errand i pass that i am the
queen's sworn servant and may not be 
counsel against her but setting this apart
methinks it were a bad road to sir william
 lochleven's favour to be the first to tell
him his son's defection neither would
the regent be over well pleased to hear the
infidelity his vassal nor morton to learn
the falsehood his kinsman
um said the steward making that
inarticulate sound which expresses surprise
 the abbot
mingled with displeasure nay then even
fly where ye list for giddypated as ye maybe
you know how to bear you in the world
 i will shew you my system is less selfish
than ye think for said the page for
i hold truth and mirth to be better than
gravity and cunning ay and in the 
to be a match for them you never loved
me less sir steward than you do at this
moment i know you will give me no real
confidence and i am resolved to accept no
false protestations as current coin resume
your old course suspect me as much and
watch me as close as you will i bid you
defiance you have met with your match
 by heaven young man said the steward
with a look bitter malignity if
thou dearest to attempt any treachery towards
the house lochleven thy head
shall blacken in the sun from the warder's
turret i
 he cannot commit treachery who refuses
trust said the page and for my
head it stands as securely on mine own
the abbot 
shoulders as on any turret that ever mason
built
farewell thou prating and speckled
pie said dryfesdale that art so vain 
thine idle tongue and variegated coat beware
trap and limetwig
 and fare thee well thou hoarse old raven
answered the page thy solemn
flight sable hue and deep croak are no
charms against birdbolt or hailshot and
that thou mayest find it is open war betwixt
us each for the cause our mistress
and god shew the right 
amen and defend his own people 
said the steward i will let my mistress
know what addition thou hast made to this
mess traitors good night monsieur
featherpate
 good night seignior sowersby replied
the page and when the old man departed
he betook himself to rest
 the abbot
chapter v
poison'd ill fare dead forsooth cast off
king john
howsoever weary roland graeme might
be the castle lochleven however
much he might wish that the plan for mary's
escape had been perfected i question
if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings
than on the morning after george douglas's
plan for accomplishing her deliverance
had been frustrated in the first place
he had the clearest conviction that he had
misunderstood the inuendo the abbot
and that the affections douglas were fixed
not on catherine seyton but on the
queen and in the second place from the
sort explanation which had taken place bethe
abbot 
twixt the steward and him he felt himself
at liberty without any breach honour towards
the family lochleven to contribute
his best aid to any scheme which should
in future be formed for the queen's escape 
and independently the good will which
he himself had to the enterprize he knew
he could find no surer road to the favour 
catherine seyton he now sought but an
opportunity to inform her that he had dedicated
himself to this task and fortune was
propitious in affording him one which was
unusually favourable
at the ordinary hour breakfast it was
introduced by the steward with the usual
forms who as soon as it was placed on the
board in the inner apartment said to roland
graeme with a glance sarcastic import
 i leave you my young sir to do
the office sewer it has been too long
rendered to the lady mary by one belonging
to the house douglas
 were it the prime and principal who
 the abbot
ever bore the name said roland the office
were an honour to him
the steward departed without replying to
this bravade otherwise than by a dark look
 scorn graeme thus left alone busied
himself as one engaged in a labour love
to imitate as well as he could the grace
and courtesy with which george douglas
was wont to render his ceremonial service
at meals to the queen scotland
there was more than youthful vanity 
there was a generous devotion in the feeling
with which he took up the task as a brave
soldier assumes the place a comrade who
has fallen in the front battle i am
now he said their only champion and
come weal come woe i will be to the best
 my skill and power as faithful as trustworthy
as brave as any douglas them
all could have been
at this moment catherine seyton entered
alone contrary to her custom and
not less contrary to her custom she enterthe
abbot 
ed with her kerchief at her eyes roland
graeme approached her with beating heart
and with downcast eyes and asked her in a
low and hesitating voiccjwhether the queen
were well 
can you suppose it said catherine 
 think you her heart and body are framed
 steel and iron to endure the cruel disappointment
 yester even and the infamous
taunts yonder puritanic hag 
would to god that i were a man to aid
her more effectually 
 if those who carry pistols and batons
and poniards said the page are not men
they are at least amazons and that is as formidable

 you are welcome to the flash your
wit sir replied the damsel i am neither
in spirits to enjoy or to reply to it
 well then said the page list to mein
all serious truth and first let me say
that the gear last night had been smoother
had you taken me into your counsels
 and so we meant but who could have
 the abbot
guessed that master page should chuse to
pass all night in the garden like some moonstricken
knight in a spanish romance instead
 being in his bedroom when douglas
came to hold communication with him
on our project 
 and why said the page defer to so
late a moment so important a confidence 
because your communications with
henderson and with pardon the natural
impetuosity and fickleness your disposition
made us dread to entrust you with a
secret such consequence till the last moment

 and why at the last moment said the
page offended at this frank avowal why
at that or any other moment since i had
the misfortune to incur so much suspicion

nay now you are angry again said
catherine and to serve you aright i
should break off this talk but i will be
magnanimous and answer your question
know then our reason for trusting you was
the abbot 
twofold in the first place we could scarce
avoid it since you slept in the room through
which we had to pass in the second
place
 nay said the page you may dispense
with a second reason when the first
makes your confidence in me a case necessity

good now hold thy peace said catherine
 in the second place as i said before
there is one foolish person among us
who believes that roland graeme's heart is
warm though his head is giddy that his
blood is pure though it boils too hastilyand
that his faith and honour are true as
the loadstar though his tongue sometimes
is far less than discreet
this avowal catherine repeated in a low
tone with her eyes fixed on the floor as if
she shunned the glance roland while
she suffered it to escape her lips and
this single friend exclaimed the youth in
rapture this only one who would do 
the abbot
time to the poor roland graeme and whose
own generous heart taught her to distinguish
between follies the brain and faults
 the heart will you not tell me dearest
catherine to whom i owe my most
grateful my most heartfelt thanks 
 nay said catherine with her eyes still
fixed on the ground if your own heart
tell you not
 dearest catherine said the page seizing
upon her hand and kneeling on one
knee
if your own heart i say tell you not
said catherine gently disengaging her hand
it is very ungrateful for since the maternal
kindness the lady fleming
the page started on his feet by heaven
catherine your tongue wears as many
disguises as your person but you only
mock me cruel girl you know the lady
fleming has no more regard for any one
than hath the forlorn princess who is wrought
into yonder piece old figured courttapestry

the abbot 
it may be so said catherine seyton
but you should not speak so loud
 pshaw answered the page but at the
same time lowering his voice she cares
for no one but herself and the queen and
you know besides there is no one you
whose opinion i value if i have not your
own no not that queen mary herself

 the more shame for you if it be so
said catherine with great composure
nay but fair catherine said the page
why will you thus damp my ardour when
i am devoting myself body and soul to the
cause your mistress 
 it is because in doing so said catherine
 you debase a cause so noble by naming
along with it any baser or more selfish
motive believe me she said with kindling
eyes and while the blood mantled on
her cheek they think vilely and falsely
 women i mean those who deserve
the name who deem that they love the
vol iii f
 the abbot
gratification their vanity or the mean
purpose engrossing a lover's admiration
and affection better than they love the virtue
and honour the man they may be
brought to prefer he that serves his religion
his prince and his country with ardour
and devotion need not plead his cause
with the commonplace rant romantic
passion the woman whom he honours with
his love becomes his debtor and her corresponding
affection is engaged to repay his
glorious toil
 you hold a glorious prize for such
toil said the youth bending his eyes on
her with enthusiasm
only a heart which knows how to value
it said catherine he that should
free this injured princess from these dungeons
and set her at freedom among her
free and warlike nobles whose hearts are
burning to welcome her where is the maiden
in scotland whdife the ove such a
hero would not honour were she sprung
from the blood royal the land and he
the abbot 
the offspring the poorest cottager that
ever held a plough 
i am determined said roland to
take the adventure tell me first however
fair catherine and speak it as if you were
confessing to the priest this poor queen
i know she is unhappy but catherine do
you hold her innocent she is accused 
murder
 do i hold the lamb guilty because it
is assailed by the wolf answered catherine
 do i hold yonder sun polluted because
an earthdamp sullies his beams 
the page sighed and looked down
would my conviction were as deep as
thine but one thing is clear that in this
captivity she hath wrong she rendered
herself up on a capitulation and the terms
have been refused her i will embrace her
quarrel to the death
 will you will you indeed said catherine
taking his hand in her turn o
be but firm in mind as thou art bold indeed
and quick in resolution j keep but
 the abbot
thy plighted faith and after ages shall honour
thee as the saviour scotland
 but when i have toiled successfully to
win that leah honour thou wilt not my
catherine said the page condemn me
to a new term service for that rachel
love 
 that said catherine again extricating
her hand from his grasp we shall
have full time to speak but honour is the
elder sister and must be won the first
i may not win her answered the page 
 but i will venture fairly for her and man
can do no more and know fair catherine
for you shall see the very secret thought
 my heart that not honour only not
only that other and fairer sister whom you
frown on me for so much as mentioning 
but the stern commands duty also compel
me to aid the queen's deliverance
indeed said catherine you were
wont to have doubts on that matter
 ay but her life was not then threatened
replied roland
the abbot 
and is it now more endangered than
heretofore asked catherine seyton in
anxious terror
 be not alarmed said the page but
you heard the terms on which your royal
mistress parted with the lady lochleven

 too well but too well said catherine
 alas that she cannot rule her
princely resentment and refrain from encounters
like these 
that hath passed betwixt them said
roland for which woman never forgives
woman i saw the lady's brow turn pale
and then black when before all the menzies
and in her moment power the
queen humbled her to the dust by taxing
her with her shame and i heard the oath
 deadly resentment and revenge which
she muttered in the ear one who by his
answer will i judge be but too ready an
executioner her will
 you terrify me said catherine
 the abbot
 do not so take it call up the masculine
part your spirit we will counteract
and defeat her plans be they dangerous
as they may why do you look upon me
thus and weep 
 alas said catherine because you
stand there before me a living and breathing
man in all the adventurous glow and
enterprize youth yet still possessing the
frolic spirits childhood there you stand
full alike generous enterprize and childish
recklessness and if today tomorrow
or some such brief space you lie a mangled
and lifeless corpse upon the floor these
hateful dungeons who but catherine seyton
will be the cause your brave and
gay career being broken short as you start
from the goal alas she whom you have
chosen to twine your wreath may too probably
have to work your shroud
 and be it so catherine said the page
in the full glow youthful enthusiasm 
 and do thou vork my shroud and if thou
the abbot 
grace it with such tears as fall now at the
thought it will honour my remains more
than an earl's mantle would my living body
but shame on this faintness heart the
time craves a firmer mood be a woman
catherine or rather be a man thou canst
be a man if thou wilt
catherine dried her tears and endeavoured
to smile
 you must not ask me she said about
that which so much disturbs your mind j
you shall know all in time nay you should
know all now but that hush here comes
the queen
mary entered from her apartment paler
than usual and apparently exhausted by a
sleepless night and by the painful thoughts
which had ill supplied the place repose j
yet the languor her looks was so far front
impairing her beauty that it only substituted
the frail delicacy the lovely woman
for the majestic grace the queen contrary
to her wont her toilette had been very
hastily dispatched and her hair which was
 the abbot
usually dressed by lady fleming with great
care escaping from beneath the headtire
which had been hastily adjusted fell in long
and luxuriant tresses nature's own curling
over a neck and bosom which were
somewhat less carefully veiled than usual
as she stepped over the threshold her
apartment catherine hastily drying her
tears ran to meet her royal mistress and
having first kneeled at her feet and kissed
her hand instantly rose and placing herself
on the other side the queen seemed
anxious to divide with the lady fleming
the honour supporting and assisting her
the page on his part advanced and put in
order the chair state which she usually
occupied and having placed the cushion
and footstool for her accommodation stepped
back and stood ready for service in
the place usually occupied by his predecessor
the young seneschal mary's eye
rested an instant on him and could not
but remark the change persons her's
was not the female heart which could rethe
abbot 
fuse compassion at least to a gallant youth
who had suffered in her cause although he
had been guided in his enterprize by a too
presumptuous passion and the words poor
douglas escaped from her lips perhaps
unconsciously as she leant herself back in
her chair and put the kerchief to her eyes
yes gracious madam said catherine
assuming a cheerful manner in order to
cheer her sovereign our gallant knight
is indeed banished the adventure was not
reserved for him but he has left behind him
a youthful esquire as much devoted to your
grace's service and who by me makes you
tender his hand and sword
if they may in aught avail your grace
said roland grasme bowing profoundly
 alas said the queen what needs
this catherine why prepare new victims
to be involved in and overwhelmed by my
cruel fortune were we not better cease to
struggle and ourselves sink in the tide without
further resistance than thus drag into
destruction with us every generous heart
f 
 the abbot
which makes an effort in our favour i
have had but too much plot and intrigue
around me since i was stretched an orphan
child in my very cradle while contending
nobles strove which should rule
in the name the unconscious innocent
surely time it were that all this busy and
most dangerous coil should let me
call my prison a convent and my seclusion
a voluntary sequestration myself from
the world and its ways
speak not thus madam before your
faithful servants said catherine to discourage
their zeal at once and to break
their hearts daughter kings be not in
this hour so unkingly come roland and
let us the youngest her followers shew
ourselves worthy her cause let us kneel
before her footstool and implore her to be
her own magnanimous self and leading
roland graeme to the queen's seat they
both kneeled down before her mary raised
herself in her chair and sat erect while
extending one hand to be kissed by the
the abbot
tn
page she arranged with the other the clustering
locks which shaded the bold yet
lovely bro w the highspirited catherine
s she often called her young attendant
 that you should thus desperately
mix with my unhappy fate the fortune 
your own young lives l are they not a lovely
couple my fleming and is it not heartrending
co think that i must be their ruin 
 not so said roland greene it is
we gracious sovereign who will be your
deliverers
 tex oritur parvulorump said the queen
looking upward if it is by the mouth 
these children that heaven calls me to resume
the stately thoughts which become
my birth and my rights thou wilt grant
them thy protection and to me the power
 rewarding their zeal then turning to
fleming she instantly added thou
knowest my friend whether to make those
who have served me happy was not ever
mary's favourite pastime when i have
 the abbot
been rebuked by the stern preachers the
calvinistic heresy when i have seen the
fierce countenances my nobles averted
from me has it not been because i mixed
in the harmless pleasures the young and
gay and rather for the sake their happiness
than my own have mingled in the
masque the song or the dance with the
youth my household well i repent
not it though knox termed it sin and
morton degradation i was happy because
i saw happiness around me and woe betide
the wretched jealousy that can extract guilt
out the overflowing an unguarded
gaiety fleming if we are restored to our
throne shall we not have one blithesome
day at a blithesome bridal which we must
now name neither the bride nor the bridegroom
 but that bridegroom shall have the
barony blairgowrie a fair gift even fora
queen to give and that bride's chaplet
shall be twined with the fairest pearls that
ever were found in the depths lochlomond
j and thou thyself mary fleming
the abbot 
the best dresser tires that ever busked the
tresses a queen and who would scorn to
touch those any woman lower rank
thou thyself shalt for my love twine them
into the bride's tresses look my fleming
suppose them such clustered locks
as those our catherine they would not
put shame upon thy skill
so saying she passed her hand fondly
over the head her youthful favourite
while her more aged attendant replied despondently
 alas madam your thoughts
stray far from home
 they do my fleming said the queen
 but is it well or kind in you to call them
back god knows they have kept theperch
this night but too closely come i will recal
the gay vision were it but to punish
them yes at that bhthesome bridal mary
herself shall forget the weight sorrows
and the toil state and herself once
more lead a measure at whose wedding
was it that we last danced my fleming
 think care has troubled my 
the abbot
more yet something it i should remember
 canst thou not aid me i know thou
canst
alas madam replied the lady 
what said mary wilt thou not help
us so far this is a peevish adherence to
thine own graver opinion which holds our
talk as folly but thou art courtbred and
wilt well understand me when i say the
queen commands lady fleming to tell her
where she led the last hranur
with a face deadly pale and a mien as
if she were about to sink into the earth the
courtbred dame no longer daring to refuse
obedience faultered out gracious lady
if my memory err not it was at a masque
in holyrood at the marriage sebastian

the unhappy queen who had hitherto
listened with a melancholy smile provoked
by the reluctance with which the lady
fleming brought out her story at this illfated
word interrupted her with a shriek so
wild and loud that the vaulted apartment
the abbot 
rang and both roland and catherine
sprung to their feet in the utmost terror
and alarm meantime mary seemed by
the train horrible ideas thus suddenly excited
surprised not only beyond selfcommand
but for the moment beyond the
verge reason
traitress she said to the lady fleming
 thou wouldst slay thy sovereign
call my french guards a moi a moi 
mes francis i am beset with traitors in
mine own palace they have murdered my
husband rescue rescue for the queen
 scotland she started up from her
chair her features late so exquisitely lovely
in their paleness now inflamed with the
fury frenzy and resembling those a
bellona we will take the field ourself
she said warn the city warn lothian
and fife saddle our spanish barb and bid
french paris see ouv petronel be charged
better to die at the head our brave
scotsmen like our grandfather at flodden
 the abbot
than a broken heart like our ill starred
father
 be patient be composed dearest sovereign
said catherine and then addressing
lady fleming angrily she added how
could you say aught that reminded her 
her husband 
the word reached the ear the unhappy
princess who caught it up speaking with
great rapidity husband what husband
 not his most christian majesty he
is ill at ease he cannot mount on horseback
 not him the lennox but it was
the puke orkney thou wouldst say
for god's love madam be patient 
said the lady fleming
but the queen's excited imagination could
by no entreaty be diverted from its course
 bid him come hither to our aid she said
 and bring with him his lambs as he calls
them bowton hay tall black armis
ton and his kinsman hob fie how swart
they are and how they smell sulphur
the abbot 
what closeted with morton nay if the
douglas and the hepburn hatch the complot
together the bird when it breaks the
shell will scare scotland will it not ray
fleming 
 she grows wilder and wilder said fleming
 we have too many hearers for these
strange words
 roland said catherine in the name
 god before you cannot aid us here 
leave us to deal with her alone away 
away 
she thrust him to the door the antiroom
 yet even when he had entered that
apartment and shut the door he could still
hear the queen talk in a loud and determined
tone as if giving forth orders until at
length the voice died away in a feeble and
continued lamentation
at this crisis catherine entered the antiroom
 be not too anxious she said the
crisis is now over but keep the door fast
let no one enter until she is more coiu
posed
 the abbot
 in the name god what does this
mean said the page or what was therein
the lady fleming's words to excite so
wild a transport 
o the lady fleming the lady fleming
said catherine repeating the words
impatiently the lady fleming is a fool 
she loves her mistress yet knows so little
how to express her love that were the queen
to ask her for very poison she would deem
it a point duty not to resist her commands
i could have torn her starched headtire
from her formal head the queen
should have as soon had the heart out 
my body as the word sebastian out my
lipsthat that piece weaved tapestry
should be a woman and yet not have wit
enough to tell a lie 
and what was this story sebastian 
said the page by heaven catherine you
are all riddles alike
you are as great a fool as fleming returned
the impatient maiden know ye
not that on the night henry darnley's
the abbot 
murder and at the blowing up the kirk
 field the queen's absence was owing to
her attending on a masque at holyrood
given by her to grace the marriage this
same sebastian who himself a favoured
servant married one her female attendants
who was near to her person 
by saint giles said the page i wonder
not at her passion but only marvel by
what forgetful ness it was that she could
urge the lady fleming with such a question

i cannot account for it said catherine
 but it seems as if great and violent
grief or horror sometimes obscure the memory
and spread a cloud like that an
exploding cannon over the circumstances
with which they are accompanied but i
may not stay here where came not to moralize
with your wisdom but simply to cool
my resentment against that unwise lady
fleming which i think hath now somewhat
abated so that i shall endure her presence
 the abbot
without any desire to damage either her
curch or pasquin meanwhile keep fast
that door would not for my life that any
 these heretics saw her in the unhappy
state which brought on her as it has
been by the success their own diabolical
plotting they would not stick to call in
their snuffling cant the judgment providence

she left the apartment just as the latch
 the outward door was raised from without
but the bolt which roland had drawn
on the inside resisted the efforts the person
desirous to enter who is there 
said graeme aloud
it is i replied the harsh and yet slow
voice the steward dryfesdale
you cannot enter now returned the
youth
 and wherefore demanded clydesdale
 seeing i come but to do my duty
and enquire what mean the shrieks from
the apartments the moabitish lady wherethe
abbot 
fore i say since such is mine errand can
i not enter 
simply replied the youth because
the bolt is drawn and i have no fancy to
undo it i have the right side the door
today as you had last night
thou art illadvised thou malapert
boy replied the steward to speak to mein
such fashion but shall inform my lady
 thine insolence
 the insolence said the page is
meant for thee only in fair guerdon thy
constant discourtesy to me for thy lady's
information i have answer more courteous
you may say that the queen is ill at ease
and desires to be disturbed neither by visits
nor messages
 i conjure you in the name god
said the old man with more solemnity in
his tone than he had hitherto used to let
me know if her malady really gains power
on her 
 she will have no aid at your hand or
at your ladywhereforebegone and 
the abbot
bie us no more we neither want nor will
accept aid at your hands
with this positive reply the steward
grumbling and dissatisfied returned downstairs

chapter v
it is the curse kings to be attended
by slaves who take their humours for a warrant
to break into the bloody house life
and on the winking authority
to understand a law
kitiff john
the lady lochleven sat alone in her
chamber endeavouring with sincere but
imperfect zeal to fix her eyes and her attention
on the blacklettered bible which
lay before her bound in velvet and embroidery
and adorned with massive silver
clasps and knosps but she found her utmost
efforts unable to withdraw her mind
from the resentful recollection what had
last night passed betwixt her and the queen
in which the latter had with such bitter
taunt reminded her her early and longrepented
transgression
 the abbot
why she said should i resent so deeply
that another reproaches me with that which
have never ceased to make matter blushing
to myself and yet why should this
woman who reaps at least has reaped the
fruits my folly and has jostled my son
aside from the throne why should she in
the face all my domestics and her
own dare to upbraid me with my shame
and folly is she not in my power does
she not fear me ha wily tempter i will
wrestle with thee strongly and with better
suggestions than my own evil heart can
supply
she again took up the sacred volume and
was endeavouring to fix her attention on its
contents when she was disturbed by a tap
at the door the room it opened at her
command and the steward dryfesdale entered
and stood before her with a gloomy
and perturbed expression on his brow
 what has chanced dryfesdale that thou
loosest thus said his mistress have
the abbot 
there been evil tidings my son or mj
grandchildren 
no lady replied dryfesdale but
you were deeply insulted last night and i
fear me thou art as deeply avenged this
morning where is the chaplain 
what mean you by hints so dark and
a question so sudden the chaplain as
you well know is absent at perth upon an
assembly the brethren
i care not answered the steward he
is but a priest baal
dryfesdale said the lady sternly
 what meanest thou i have ever heard
that in the low countries thou didst herd
with the anabaptist preachers those boars
which tear up the vintage but the ministry
which suits me and my house must
content my retainers
i would i had good ghostly counsel
though replied the steward not attending
tohismistres's rebuke and seeming speak
to himself this woman moab 
vol iii g
 the abbot
speak her with reverence said the
lady she is a king's daughter
 ee it so replied dryfesdale she
goes where there is little difference betwixt
her and a beggar's child mary scotland
is dying
dying and in my castle said the lady
starting up in alarm what disease or
by what accident
bear patience lady the ministry was
mme
 thine villain and traitor i how didst
thou dare 
i heard you insulted lady i heard you
demand vengeance i promised it you and
i now bring tidings it
 dryfesdale i trust thou rarest said
the lady
i rave not replied the steward that
which was written me a million years
ere i saw the light must be executed by
me she hath that in her veins that i fear
me will soon stop the springs life
the abbot 
cruel villain exclaimed the lady
 thou hast not poisoned her 
and if i had said dryfesdale what
does it so greatly merit men bane vermin
why not rid them their enemies so 
in italy they will do it for a cruizuedor
cowardly ruffian begone from my
sight 
think better my zeal lady said the
steward and judge not without looking
around you lindsay ruthven and your
kinsman morton poniard rizzio and yet
you now see no blood on their embroidery
the lord semple stabbed the lord 
farquhar does his bonnet sit a jot more
awry on his brow what noble lives in scotland
who has nothad a share for policy or revenge
in some such dealing and who imputes
it to them be not cheated with names
a dagger or a draught work to the same
 and are little unlike a glass phial imprisons
the one and a leathern sheath the
other one deals with the brain the other
 the abbot
sluices the blood yet say not i gave
aught to this lady
 what dost thou mean by thus dallying
with me said the lady as thou wouldst
gave thy neck from the rope it merits tell
me the whole truth this story thou hast
long been known a dangerous man
ay in my master's service i can be
cold and sharp as my sword be it known
to you that when last on shore i consulted
with a woman skill and power called
nicneven whom the country has rung
for this some brief time past fools asked
her for charms to make them beloved misers
for means to increase their store some
demanded to know the future an idle wish
since it cannot be altered others would
have an explanation the past idler still
since it cannot be recalled i heard their
queries with scorn and demanded the means
 avenging myself a deadly enemy for
i grow old and may trust no longer to bilboa
blade she gave me a packet mix
the abbot 
that said she with any liquid and thy vengeance
is complete
 villain and you mixed it with the
food this imprisoned lady to the dishonour
 thy master's house 
 to redeem the insulted honour my
master's house i mixed the contents the
packet with the jar succory water they
seldom fail to drain it and the woman loves
it over all
 it was a work hell said the lady
lochleven both the asking and the granting
 away wretched man let us see if aid
be yet too late 
they will not admit us madam save
we enter by force i have been twice at
the door but can obtain no entrance
 we will beat it level with the ground
if needful and hold summon randal
hither instantly randal here is a foul
and evil chance befallen send off a boat
instantly to kinross the chamberlain luke
lund in is said to have skill fetch too
 the abbot
that foul witch nicneven she shall first
counteract her own spell and then be burned
to ashes in the island saint serf
away away tell them to hoist sail and
ply oar as ever they would have good 
the douglas's hand
 mother nicneven will not be lightly
found or fetched hither on these conditions
answered dryfesdale
 then grant her full assurance safety
 look to it for thine own life must answer
for this lady's recovery
 i might have guessed that said clydesdale
sullenly j but it is my comfort i
have avenged mine own cause as well as
yours she hath scoffed and stripped at
me and encouraged her saucy minion 
a page to ridicule my stiff gait and slow
speech i felt it borne in upon me that i
was to be avenged on them
go to the western turret said the
lady and remain there in ward until we
see how this gear will terminate i know
the abbot 
thy resolved disposition thou wilt not attempt
escape
not were the walls the turret eggshells
and the lake sheeted with ice said
dryfesdale i am well taught and strong
in belief that man does nought himself 
he is but the foam on the billow which
rises bubbles and bursts not by its own
effort but by the mightier impulse fate
which urges him yet lady if i may advise
amid this zeal for the life the jezebel
 scotland forget not what is due to
thine own honour and keep the matter secret
as you may
so saying the gloomy fatalist turned from
her and stalked off vith sullen composure
to the place confinement allotted to him
his lady caught at his last hint and only
expressed her fear that the prisoner had
partaken some unwholesome food and
was dangerously ill the castle was soon
alarmed and in confusion randal was dispatched
to the shore to fetch off lundin
 the abbot
with such remedies as could counteract
poison and with farther instructions to
bring mother nineveh if she could be
found with fall power to pledge the lady
 lochleven's word for her safety
meanwhile the lady lochleven herself
held parley at the door the queen's
apartment and in vain urged the page to
undo it
 foolish boy she said thine own
life and thy lady's are at stake open i
say or we will cause the door to be broken
down
i may not open the door without my
royal mistress's orders answered roland j
she has been very ill and now she 
you wake her by using violence
let the consequence be on you and your
followers
was ever woman in a strait so fearful 
said the lady lochleven at least
thou rash boy beware that no one tastes
the food but especially the jar succorywater

the abbot 
she then hastened to the turret where
dryfesdale had composedly resigned himself
to imprisonment she found him reading
and demanded him was thy fell
potion speedy operation 
slow answered the steward the
hag asked me which i chose i told her i
loved a slow and sure revenge revenge
said i is the highestflavoured draught
which man tastes upon earth and he should
sip it by little and little not drain it up
greedily at once
 against whom unhappy man couldst
thou nourish so fell a revenge 
 i had many objects but the chief was
that insolent page
 the boy thou inhuman man exclaimed
the lady what could he do to
deserve thy malice 
 he rose in your favour and you graced
him with your commissions that was
one thing he rose in that george douglas's
also that was another he was the
g 
 the abbot
favourite the calvinistic henderson who
hated me because my spirit disowns a separated
priesthood the moabitish queen
held him dear winds from each opposing
point blew in his favour the old servitor
 your house was held lightly among ye 
above all from the first time i saw his face
i longed to destroy him
 what fiend have i nurtured in my
house replied the lady may god forgive
me the sin having given thee food
and raiment 
you might not chuse lady answered
the steward long ere this castle was
builded ay long ere the islet which sustains
it reared its head above the blue water
i was destined to be your faithful slave
and you to be my ungrateful mistress remember
you not when i plunged amid the
victorious french in the time this lady's
mother and brought offyour husband when
those who had hung at the same breasts
with him dared not attempt the rescue 
the abbot 
remember how i plunged into the lake
when your grandson's skiff was overtaken
by the tempest boarded and steered her
safe to the land lady the servant a
scottish baron is he who regards not his
own life or that any other save his master
and for the death the woman i
had tried the potion on her sooner had not
master george been her taster her death
would it not be the happiest news that
scotland ever heard is she not the
bloody russian stock whose sword was so
often red with the blood gods saints 
is she not the daughter the wretched tyrant
james whom heaven cast down from
his kingdom and his pride even as the king
 babylon was smitten 
peace villain said the lady a thousand
varied recollections thronging on her
mind at the mention her royal lover's
name peace and disturb not the ashes
 the dead the royal the unhappy
dead read thy bible and may god grant
thee to avail thyself better its contents
 the abbot
than thou hast yet done she departed
hastily and as she reached the next apartment
the tears rose to her eyes so hastily
that she was compelled to stop and use her
kerchief to dry them i expected not this
she said no more than to have drawn water
from the dry flint or sap from a withered
tree i saw with a dry eye the apostacy
and shame george douglas the hope 
my son's house the child my love j and
yet i now weep for him who has so long
lain in his grave for him to whom i owe
it that his daughter can make a scoffing ancf
a jest my name but she is ms daughter
my heart hardened against her for so
many causes relents when a glance her
eye places her father unexpectedly before
me and as often her likeness to that true
daughter the house guise her detested
mother has again confirmed my resolution
but she must not must not die in my
house and by so foul a practice thank
god the operation the potion is slow
and may be counteracted i will to her
the abbot 
apartment once more but o that hardened
villain whose fidelity we held in such
esteem and had such high proof what
miracle can unite so much wickedness and
so much truth in one bosom 
the lady lochleven was not aware
how far minds a certain gloomy and determined
cast by nature may be warped by
a keen sense petty injuries and insult
combining with the love gain and sense
 selfinterest and amalgamated with the
crude wild and undigested fanatical opinions
which this man had gathered among
the crazy sectaries germany or how far
the doctrines fatalism which he had embraced
so decidedly sear the human conscience
by representing our actions as the
result inevitable necessity
during her visit to the prisoner roland
had communicated to catherine the tenor
 the conversation he had had with her at
the door the apartment the quick intelligence
 that lively maiden instantly
comprehended the outline what was bets
the abbot
lived to have happened but her prejudices
hurried her beyond the truth
they meant to have poisoned us she
exclaimed in horror and there stands the
fatal liquor which should have done the
deed ay as soon as douglas ceased to be
our taster our food was like to be fatally
seasoned thou roland who shouldst have
made the essay wert readily doomed to die
with us o dearest lady fleming pardon
pardon for the injuries i said to you
in my anger your words were prompted
by heaven to save our lives and especially
that the injured queen but what have
we now to do that old crocodile the
lake will be presently back to shed her hypocritical
tears over our dying agonies 
lady fleming what shall we do 
our lady help us in our need i she
replied how should i tell unless we
were to make our plaint to the regent
make our plaint to the devil said catherine
impatiently and accuse his dam
at the foot his burning throne the queen
the abbot 
still sleeps we must gain time the poisoning
hag must not know her scheme has
miscarried the old envenomed spider has
but too many ways mending her broken
web the jar succory water said she
roland if thou best a man help me 
empty the jar on the chimney or from the
window make such waste among the viands
as if we had made our usual meal and
leave the fragments on cup and porringer
but taste nothing as thou lowest thy life i
will sit by the queen and tell her at her
waking in what a fearful pass we stand
her sharp wit and ready spirit will teach
us what is best to be done meanwhile till
farther notice observe roland that the
queen is in a state torpor that lady
fleming is indisposed that character
speaking in a lower tone will suit her best
and save her wits some labour in vain i
am not so much indisposed thou understands

and i said the page
 the abbot
 you replied catherine you are
quite well who thinks it worth while to
poison puppydogs or pages
 does this levity become the time 
said the page
 it does it does answered catherine
seyton if the queen approves i see
plainly how this disconcerted attempt may
do us good service
she went to work while she spoke eagerly
assisted by roland the breakfast table
soon displayed the appearance as if the ladies
had eaten their meal as usual and the
ladies retired as softly as possible into the
queen's sleeping apartment at a new
summons the lady lochleven the page
undid the door and admitted her into the
antiroom asking her pardon for having
withstood her alleging in excuse that the
queen had fallen into a heavy slumber since
she had broken her fast
she has eaten and drunken then said
the lady lochleven
the abbot ll
surely replied the page according to
her grace's ordinary custom unless upon
the fasts the church
the jar she said hastily examining
it it is empty drank the lady mary the
whole this water 
a large part madam and i heard the
lady catherine seyton jestingly upbraid
the lady mary fleming with having taken
more than a just share what remained
so that but little fell to her own lot
and are they well in health said the
lady lochleven
lady fleming said the page complains
 lethargy and looks duller than
usual and the lady catherine seyton
feels her head somewhat more giddy than
is her wont
he raised his voice a little as he said
these words to apprize the ladies the
part assigned to each them and not perhaps
without the wish conveying to the
ears catherine the pagelike jest which
lurked in the allotment
 the abbot
 i will enter the queen's chamber said
the lady lochleven my business is express

as she advanced to the door the voice
 catherine seyton was heard from within
 no one can enter here the queen
sleeps
 i will not be controuled young lady
replied the lady lochleven there is
i wot no inner bar and i will enter in
your despite
 there is indeed no inner bar answered
catherine firmly but there are the
staples where that bar should be and into
those staples have i thrust mine arm like
an ancestress your own when better
employed than the douglasseses our days
she thus defended the bedchamber her
sovereign against murderers try your
force then and see whether a seyton cannot
rival in courage a maiden the house
 douglas
i dare not attempt the pass at such
risk said the lady lochleven strange
the abbot 
that this princess with all that justly attaches
to her as blameworthy should preserve
such empire over the minds her
attendants damsel i give thee my honour
that i come for the queen's safety
and advantage awaken her if thou lowest
her and pray her leave that i may enter
i will retire from the door the whilst
 thou wilt not awaken the queen
said the lady fleming
 what choice have we said the readywitted
maiden unless you deem it better
to wait till the lady lochleven herself plays
lady the bedchamber her fit patience
will not last long and the queen
must be prepared to meet her
but thou wilt bring back her grace's
fit by thus disturbing her
 heaven forbid i replied catherine j
but if so it must pass for an effect the
poison hope better things and that the
queen will be able when she wakes to form
her own judgment in this terrible crisis
meanwhile do thou dear lady fleming
 the abbot
practise to look as dull and heavy as the
alertness thy spirit will permit
catherine kneeled by the side the
queen's bed and kissing her hand repeatedly
succeeded at last in awakening without
alarming her she seemed surprised to find
that she was ready dressed but sate up in
her bed and appeared so perfectly composed
that catherine seyton without farther
preamble judged it safe to inform her 
the predicament in which they were placed
mary turned pale and crossed herself again
and again when she heard the imminent
danger in which she had stood but like
the ulysses horner
hardly waking yet
sprung in her mind the momentary wit
and she at once understood her situation
with the dangers and advantages that attended
it
 we cannot do better she said after
her hasty conference with catherine press
the abbot lacing
her at the same time to her bosom and
kissing her forehead we cannot do better
than to follow the scheme so happily
devised by thy quick wit and bold affection
undo the door to the lady lochleven 
she shall meet her match in art though not
in perfidy fleming draw close the curtain
and get thee behind it thou art a
better tirewoman than an actress but do
but breathe heavily and if thou wilt groan
slightly and it will top thy part hark 
they come now catherine medicis
may thy spirit inspire me for a cold northern
brain is too blunt for this scene 
ushered by catherine seyton and stepping
as light as she could the lady lochleven
was ushered into the twilight apartment
and conducted to the side the
couch where mary pallid and exhausted
from a sleepless night and the subsequent
agitation the morning lay extended so
listlessly as might well confirm the worst
fears her hostess
 the abbot
now god forgive us our sins said
the lady lochleven forgettingherpride
and throwing herself on her knees by the
side the bed it is too true she is
murdered
 who is in the chamber said mary
as if awaking from a heavy sleep j seyton
fleming where are you i heard a strange
voice who waits call ourselves
alas her memory is at holyrood
though her body is at lochleven forgive
madam continued the lady if i
call your attention to me i am margaret
erskine the house mar by marriage
lady douglas lochleven
 o our gentle hostess answered the
queen who hath such care our lodgings
and our diet we cumber you too
much and too long good lady lochleven
 but we now trust your task hospitality
is well nigh ended
her words go like a knife through my
heart said the lady lochleven with
the abbot 
a breaking heart i pray your grace to tell
me what is your ailment that aid may be
had if there be yet time 
 nay my ailment replied the queen
is nothing nothing worth telling or
worth a leech's notice my limbs feel heavy
my heart feels cold a prisoner's limbs
and heart are rarely otherwise fresh air
methinks and freedom would soon revive
me but as the estates have ordered it
death alone can break my prisondoors
 were it possible madam said the lady
 that your liberty could restore your
perfect health i would myself encounter
the resentment the regent my son
sir william my whole friends rather
than you should meet your fate in this
castle
 alas madam said the lady fleming
who conceived the time propitious to shew
that her own address had been held too
lightly it is but trying what good freedom
may work upon us for myself i think
 the abbot
a free walk on the greensward would dome
much good at heart
the lady lochleven rose from the
bedside and darted a penetrating look at
the elder valetudinary are you so evildisposed
lady fleming
evildisposed indeed madam replied
the court dame and more especially since
breakfast
 help help exclaimed catherine
anxious to break off a conversation which
boded her schemes no good help i
say help the queen is about to pass away
aid her lady lochleven if you be a woman

the lady hastened to support the queen's
head who turning her eyes towards her
with an air great languor exclaimed
thanks my dearest lady lochleven 
notwithstanding some passages late i
have never misconstrued or misdoubt
your affection to our house it was proved
as i have heard before i was born
the abbot g
the lady lochleven sprung from the
floor on which she had again knelt and having
paced the apartment in great disorder
flung open the lattice as if to get air
 now our lady forgive me said catherine
to herself how deep must the
love sarcasm be implanted in the breasts
 us women since the queen with all her
sense will risk ruin rather than rein in her
wit she then adventured stooping over
the queen's person to press her arm with
her hand saying at the same time for
god's sake madam restrain yourself
thou art too forward maiden said
the queen but immediately added in a
low whisper forgive me catherine but
when i felt the hag's murderous handsbusy
about my head and neck i felt such disgust
and hatred that i must have said something
or died but i will be schooled to better
saviour only see that thou let her not
touch me
 now god be praised said the lady
vol iii h
 the abbot
lochleven withdrawing her head from the
window the boat comes as fast as sail and
oar can send wood through water it brings
the leech and a female certainly from the
appearance the very person i was in quest
 were she but well out this castle
with our honour safe i would that she were
on the top the wildest mountain in norway
or i would i had been there myself
ere i had undertaken this trust
while she thus expressed herself standing
apart at one window roland gramme
from the other watched the boat bursting
through the waters the lake which glided
from its side in ripple and in foam he
too became sensible that at the stern was
seated the medical chamberlain clad in his
black velvet cloak and that his own relative
magdalen graeme in her assumed character
 mother nicneven stood in the bow
her hands clasped together and pointed towards
the castle and her attitude even at
that distance expressing enthusiastic eagerness
to arrive at the landingplace they
the abbot 
arrived there accordingly and while the
supposed witch was detained in a room beneath
the physician was ushered to the
queen's apartment which he entered withall
due professional solemnity catherine
had in the meanwhile fallen back from the
queen's bed and taken an opportunity to
whisper to roland methinks from the
information the threadbare velvet cloak
and the solemn beard there would be little
trouble in haltering yonder ass but thy
grandmother roland thy grandmother's
zeal will ruin us if she get not a hint to dissemble

roland without reply glided toward the
door the apartment crossed the parlour
and safely entered the antichamber but
when he attempted to pass farther the word
back back echoed from one to the other
by two men armed with carabines convinced
him that the lady lochleven's suspicions
had not even in the midst her
alarms been so far lulled to sleep as to omit
the precaution stationing sentinels on
 the abbot
her prisoners he was compelled therefore
to return to the parlour or audiencechamber
in which he found the lady the
castle in conference with her learned leech
a truce with your cant phrase and
your solemn foppery lundinin such terms
she accosted the man art and let me
know instantly if thou canst tell whether
this lady hath swallowed aught that is less
than wholesome
 nay but good lady honoured patroness
 to whom i am alike bondsman in my
medical and official capacity deal reasonably
with me if this mine illustrious patient
will not answer a question saving
with sighs and moans if that other honourable
lady will do nought but yawn in my
face when i enquire after the diagnostics 
and if that other young damsel who i profess
is a comely maidens
 talk not to me comeliness or 
damsels said the lady lochleven i
say are they evildisposed in one word
man have they taken poison ay or no 
the abbot 
poisons madam said the learned leech
 are various sorts there is your animai
poison as the lepus marinus as mentioned
by dioscorides and galen there are mineral
and semimineral poisons as those compounded
 sublimate regulus antimony
vitriol and the arsenical salts there are
your poisons from herbs and vegetables as
the aqua cymbal arise opium aconitum cantharides
and the like there are also
 now out upon thee for a learned fool i
and i myself am no better for expecting an
oracle from such a log said the lady
 nay but if your ladyship will have patience
 if i knew what food they have partaken
 or could see but the remnants 
what they have last eaten for as to the external
and internal symptoms i can discover
nought like for as galen saith in his
second de antidotes
away fool said the lady j send me
that hag hither j she shall avouch what it
was that she hath given to the wretch
 the abbot
dryfesdale or the pilniewinks and thumbs
shall wrench it out her finger joints
 art hath no enemy unless the ignorant
said the mortified doctor veiling
however his remark under the latin version
and stepping apart into a corner to
watch the result
in a minute or two magdalen grasme
entered the apartment dressed as we have
described her at the revel but with her
muffler thrown back and all affectation 
disguise she was attended by two guards
 whose presence she did not seem even
to be conscious and who followed her with
an air embarrassment and timidity which
was probably owing to their belief in her
supernatural power coupled with the effect
produced by her bold and undaunted demeanour
she confronted the lady 
lochleven who seemed to endure with
high disdain the confidence her look and
manner
 wretched woman said the lady after
the abbot 
essaying for a moment to bear her down before
she addressed her by the stately severity
 her look what was that powder which
thou didst give to a servant this house
by name robert dryfesdale that he might
work out with it some slow and secret vengeance
 confess its nature and properties
or by the honour douglas i give thee
to fire and stake before the sun is lower i
 alas said magdalen graeme in reply
and when became a douglas or a douglas's
man so unfurnished his means 
revenge that he should seek them at the
hands a poor and solitary woman the
towers in which your captives pine away
into unpitied graves yet stand fast on the
foundation the crimes wrought in them
have not yet burst their vaults asunder 
your men have still their crossbows pistolets
and daggers why need you seek
to herbs or charms for the execution 
your revenges 
 hear me foul hag said the lady 
lochleven but what avails speaking to
 the abbot
thee bring drjfesdale hither and let
them be confronted together
 you may spare your retainers the labour
replied magdalen graeme i came
not here to be confronted with a base
groom nor to answer the interrogatories 
james's heretical leman i came to speak
with the queen scotland give place
there 
and while the lady lochleven stood
confounded at her boldness and at the reproach
she had cast upon her magdalen
grseme strode past her into the bedchamber
 the queen and kneeling on the floor
made a salutation as if in the oriental fashion
she meant to touch the earth with
her forehead
 hail princess she said hail daughter
 many a king but graced above them
all in that thou art called to suffer for the
true faith hail to thee the pure gold 
whose crown has been tried in the seventimes
heated furnace affliction hear the
comfort which god and our lady send
the abbot 
thee by the mouth thy unworthy servant
 but first and stooping her head
she crossed herself repeatedly and still upon
her knees appeared to be rapidly reciting
some formula devotion
 seize her and drag her to the massymore
i to the deepest dungeon with the
sorceress whose master the devil could
alone have inspired her with boldness
enough to insult the mother douglas in
his own castle
thus spoke the incensed lady lochleven
but the physician presumed to interposes

 i pray you honoured madam she
be permitted to take her course without interruption
peradventure we shall learn
something concerning the nostrum she hath
ventured contrary to law and the rules 
art to exhibit to these ladies through the
medium the steward dryfesdale
 for a fool replied the lady locris
 thou hast counselled wisely i
h a
 the abbot
will bridle ray resentment till their conference
be over
 god forbid honoured lady said doctor
lundin that you should suppress it
longer nothing may more endanger the
frame your honoured body and truly
if there be witchcraft in this matter it is
held by the vulgar and even by solid authors
on daemonology that three scruples the
ashes the witch when she hath been welland
carefully burned at a stake is a grand
catholicon in such matter even as they
prescribe crisis canis rabid a hair the
dog that bit the patient in cases hydrophobia
i warrant neither treatment being
out the regular practice the schools 
but in the present case there can be little
harm in trying the conclusion upon this old
necromancer and quacksalver a experiments
as we say in corpore vil
peace fool said the lady she is
about to speak
at that moment magdalen graeme arose
from her knees and turned her countenance
the abbot 
on the queen at the same time advancing
her foot extending her arm and assuming
the mien and attitude a sybil in frenzy
as her grey hair floated back from under
her coif and her eye gleamed fire from under
its shaggy eye brow the effect her
expressive though emaciated features was
heightened by an enthusiasm approaching
to insanity and her appearance struck with
awe all who were present her eyes for a
time glanced wildly around as if seeking
for something to aid her in collecting her
powers expression and her lips had a
nervous and quivering motion as those 
one who would fain speak yet rejects as
inadequate the words which present themselves
mary herself caught the infection
as if by a sort magnetic influence and
raising herself from her bed without being
able to withdraw her eyes from those magdalen
waited as if for the oracle a pythoness
she waited not long for no sooner had
the enthusiast collected herself than her
gaze became intensely steady her features
 the abb or
assumed a determined energy and no sooner
did she begin to speak than the words flowed
from her with a profuse fluency which
might have passed for inspiration and which
perhaps she herself mistook for such
arise she said queen france
and england arise lioness scotland
and be not dismayed though the nets 
the hunters have encircled thee stoop not
to feign with the false ones whom thou shall
soon meet in the field the issue battle
is with the god armies but by battle thy
cause shall be tried lay aside then the
arts lower mortals and assume those
which become a queen true defender 
lie only true faith the armoury heaven
is open to thee faithful daughter the
church take the keys st peter to bind
and to loose royal princess the land
take the sword saint paul to smite and
to shear there is darkness in thy destiny j 
but not in these towers not under the rule
 their haughty mistress shall that destiny
be closed in other lands the lioness may
the abbot 
crouch to the power the tigress but not
in her own not in scotland shall the queen
 scotland long remain captive nor is the
fate the royal stuart in the hands the
traitor douglas let the lady lochleven
double her bolts and deepen her dungeons
they shall not retain thee each element
shall give thee its assistance ere thou
shalt continue captive the land shall lend
its earthquakes the water its waves the air
its tempests the fire its devouring flames
to desolate this house rather than it shall
continue the place thy captivity hear
this and tremble all ye who fight against
the light for she says it to whom it hath
been assured 
she was silent and the astonished physician
said if there was ever an jenergu
mene or possessed demoniac in our days
there is a devil speaking with that woman's
tongue
 practice said the lady lochleven
recovering her surprise here is all prac
 the abbot
time and imposture to the dungeon with
her
lady lochleven said mary arising
from her bed and coming forward with her
wonted dignity ere you make arrest on
any one in our presence hear me but one
word i have done you some wrong i believed
you privy to the murderous purpose
 your vassal and i deceived you in suffering
you to believe it had taken effect i
did you wrong lady lochleven for i
perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere
we tasted not the liquid nor are
we now sick save that we languish for our
freedom
 it is avowed like mary scotland
said magdalen graeme and know besides
that had the queen drained the
draught to the dregs it was harmless as
the water from a sainted spring trow ye
proud woman she added addressing herself
to the lady lochleven that i i
would have been the wretch to put poi
the abbot 
son in the hands a servant or vassal the
house lochleven knowing whom that
house contained as soon would i have furnished
drug to slay my own daughter
 am i thus bearded in mine own castle
said the lady to the dungeon with her 
she shall able what is due to the vender 
poisons and practiser witchcraft
yet hear me for an instant lady 
lochleven said mary and do you to
magdalen be silent at my command 
your steward lady has by confession attempted
my life and those my household
and this woman hath done her best to
save them by furnishing him with what was
harmless in place the fatal drugs which
he expected methinks i propose to you
but a fair exchange when say i forgive
your vassal with all my heart and leave
vengeance to god and to his conscience
so that you also forgive the boldness this
woman in your presence for we trust you
do not hold it as a crime that she subsoil
 the abbot
tuned an innocent beverage for the mortal
poison which was to have drenched our
cup
 heaven forefend madam said the lady
 that i should account that a crime which
saved the house douglas from a foul
breach honour and hospitality we have
written to our son touching our vassals delict
and he must abide his doom which
will most likely be death touching this
woman her trade is damnable by scripture
and is mortally punished by the wise laws
 our ancestry she also must abide her
doom
and have i then said the queen no
claim on the house lochleven for the
wrong i have so nearly suffered within their
walls i ask but in requital the life a frail
and aged woman whose brain as yourself
may judge seems somewhat affected by
years and suffering
 if the lady mary replied the inflexible
lady lochleven hath been mena
the abbot 
cet with wrong in the house douglas it
may be regarded as some compensation that
her complete have cost that house the exile
 a valued son
 plead no more for me my gracious
sovereign said magdalen graeme nor
abase yourself to ask so much as a grey
hair my head at her hands i knew the
risk at which i served my church and my
queen and was ever prompt to pay my poor
life as the ransom it is a comfort to think
that in slaying me or in restraining my freedom
or even in injuring that single grey
hair the house whose honour she boasts
so highly will have filled up the measure
 their shame by the breach their solemn
written assurance safety and
taking from her bosom a paper she handed
it to the queen
 it is a solemn assurance safety in
life and limb said queen mary with
space to come and to go under the hand
and seal the chamberlain kinross
 the abbot
granted to magdalen graeme commonly
called mother nicneven in consideration
 her consenting to put herself for the
space twentyfour hours if required within
the iron gate the castle cochlea

 knave said the lady turning to the
chamberlain how dared you grant her
such a protection 
it was by your ladyship's orders transmitted
by randal as he can bear witness
replied doctor lundin j nay i am only
like the pharmacopoeia who compounds
the drugs after the order the medicines
 i remember i remember answered
the lady but i meant the assurance only
to be used in case by residing in another
jurisdiction she could not have been apprehended
under our warrant
nevertheless said the queen the
lady lochleven is bound by the action
 her deputy in granting the assurance
madam replied the lady the house
the abbot 
 douglas have never broken their safeconduct
and never will do too deeply did
they suffer by such a breach trust exercised
on themselves when your grace's ancestor
the second james in defiance the
rights hospitality and his own written
assurance safety poniard the brave
earl douglas with his own hand and
within two yards the social board at
which he had just before sat the king 
scotland's honoured guest
 methinks said the queen carelessly
 in consideration so very recent and
enormous a tragedy which i think only
chanced some six score years agone the
douglasseses should have shewn themselves
less tenacious the company their sovereigns
than you lady lochleven seem
to be mine
let randal said the lady take the hag
back to kinross and set her at full liberty
discharging her from our bounds in future
on peril her head and let your wisdom
to the chamberlain keep her 
the abbot
any and fear not for your character
though i send you in such company j for
granting her to be a witch it would be a
waste faggots to burn you for a wizard
the crestfallen chamberlain was preparing
to depart j but magdalen graeme collecting
herself was about to reply when the
queen interposed saying good mother
we heartily thank you for your unfeigned
zeal towards our person and pray you as our
liege woman that you abstain from whatever
may lead you into personal danger and
further it is our will that you depart without
a word farther parley with any one in
this castle for thy present guerdon take
this small reliquary it was given to us by
our uncle the cardinal and hath had the
benediction the holy father himself 
and now depart in peace and in silence
for you learned sir continued the queen
advancing to the doctor who made his reverence
in a manner doubly embarrassed
by the awe the queen's presence which
made him fear to do too little and by the
the abbot 
apprehension his lady's displeasure incase
he should chance to do too much 
 for you learned sir as it was not your
fault though surely our own good fortune
that we did not need your skill at this time
it would not become us however circumstanced
to suffer our leech to leave us without
such guerdon as we can offer
with these words and with the grace
which never forsook her though in the present
case there might lurk under it a little
gentle ridicule she offered a small embroidered
purse to the chamberlain who with
extended hand and arched back his learned
face stooping until a physiognomist
might have practised the microscopical
science upon it as seen from behind betwixt
his gambadoes was about to accept
 the professional recompence offered by
so fair as well as illustrious an hand but
the lady interposed and regarding the
chamberlain said aloud no servant 
our house without instantly relinquishing
 the abbot
that character and incurring withal our
highest displeasure shall dare receive any
gratuity at the hand the lady mary
sadly and slowly the chamberlain raised
his depressed stature into the perpendicular
attitude and left the apartment dejectedly
followed by magdalen graeme after
with mute but expressive gesture she had
kissed the reliquary with which the queen
had presented her and raising her clasped
hands and uplifted eyes towards heaven had
seemed to entreat a benediction upon the
royal dame as she left the castle and
went towards the quay where the boat lay
roland graeme anxious to communicate
with her if possible threw himself in her
way and might have succeeded in exchanging
a few words with her as she was guarded
only by the dejected chamberlain and
his halberdiers but she seemed to have
taken in its most strict and literal acceptation
the command to be silent which
she had received from the queen for to
the abbot 
the repeated signs her grandson she
only replied by laying her finger on her
lip dr lundin was not so reserved regret
for the handsome gratuity and for the
compulsory task selfdenial imposed on
him had grieved the spirit that worthy
officer and learned medicine even
thus my friend said he squeezing the
page's hand as he bade him farewell is
merit rewarded i came to cure this unhappy
lady and i profess she well deserves
the trouble for say what they will her
she hath a most winning manner a sweet
voice a gracious smile and a most majestic
wave her hand if she was not poisoned
say my dear master roland was
that fault mine i being ready to cure
her if she had and now i am denied the
permission to accept my wellearned honorarium

he wiped his eyes stepped on the gunwale
and the boat pushed off from the
shore and went merrily across the lake
 which was dimpled by the summer wind 
the abbot 
chapter 
death distant no alas he's ever with u
and shakes the dart at us in all our actings 
he lurks within our cup while we're in health 
sits by our sickbed mocks our medicines 
we cannot walk or sit or ride or travel
but death is bye to seize us when he lists
the spanish father
from the agitating scene in the queen's
presencechamber the lady lochleven
retreated to her own apartment and ordered
the steward to be called before her
 have they not disarmed thee clydesdale
 she said on seeing him enter accoutered
as usual with sword and dagger
 no replied the old man how should
they your ladyship when you commanded
me to ward said nought laying
down my arms and i think none your
vol iii i
 the abbot
menials without your order or your son's
dare approach jasper dryfesdale for such
a purpose shall i now give up my sword
to you it is worth little now for it has
fought for your house till it is worn down
to cold iron like the panther's old chipping
knife
you have attempted a deadly crime 
poison under trust
 under trust hem i know not what
your ladyship thinks it but the world
without thinks the trust was given you even
for that very and you would have been
well off had it been so ended as i proposed
and you neither the worse nor the wiser
 wretch exclaimed the lady and
fool as villain who could not even execute
the crime he had planned 
 i bid as fair for it as man could replied
dryfesdale i went to a woman 
a witch and a papist if i found not poison
it was because it was otherwise predestined
i tried fair for it j but the halfdone job
may be clouted if you will
the abbot 
 villain i am even now about to send
off an express messenger to my son to take
order how thou shouldst be disposed 
prepare thyself for death if thou canst
 he that looks on death lady answered
dryfesdale as that which he may not
shun and which has its own fixed and certain
hour is ever prepared for it he that
is hanged in may will eat no flames in midsummer
 so there is the moan made for the
old servingman but whom pray i send
you on so fair an errand 
 there will be no lack messengers
answered his mistress
by my hand but there will replied
the old man your castle is but poorly
manned considering the watches that you
must keep having this charge there is
the warder and two others whom you discarded
for tampering with master george 
then for the warder's tower the bailie the
donjon five men mount each guard and
the rest must sleep for the most part in their
clothes to send away another man were
 the abdn
to harass the sentinels to death unthrifty
misuse for a household to take in new
soldiers were dangerous the charge requiring
tried men i see but one thing for
it i will do your errand to sir william
douglas myself
 that were indeed a resource and on
what day within twenty years would it be
done said the lady
 even with the speed man and horse
said clydesdale for though i care not
much about the latter days an old serving
man's life yet i would like to know as
soon as may be whether my neck is mine
own or the hangman's
 oldest thou thy own life so lightly j
said the lady
 else i had recked more that 
others said the predestinarian what is
death it is but ceasing to live and what
is living a weary return light and
darkness sleeping and waking being hungered
and eating your dead man needs
neither candle nor can neither fire nor
the abbot 
featherbed and the joiner's chest serves
him for an eternal freezejerkin
 wretched man believes thou not that
after the death comes the judgment 
lady answered dryfesdale as my
mistress i may not dispute your words but
as spiritually speaking you are still but a
burner bricks in egypt ignorant the
freedom the saints for as was well
shewn to me by that gifted man nicholas
schoefferbach who was martyred by the
bloody bishop munster he cannot sin
who doth but execute that which is predestined
since
silence said the lady interrupting
him answer me not with thy bold and
presumptuous blasphemy but hear me 
thou hast been long the servant our
house
 the bornservant the douglas they
have had the best me i served them
since left lockerbie i was then ten years
old and you may soon add the threescore
to it
 the abbot
thy foul attempt has miscarried so
thou art guilty only in intention it were
a deserved deed to hang thee on the warder's
tower and yet in thy present mind
it were but giving a soul to satan i take
thine offer then go hence here is my
packet i will add to it but a line to desire
him to send me a faithful servant or
two to complete the garrison let my son
deal with you as he will if thou art wise
thou wilt make for lockerbie so soon as
thy foot touches dry land and let the
packet find another bearer at all rates
look it miscarries not
nay madam replied he i was
born as i said the douglasseses servant and
i will be no corbiemessenger in mine old
age your message to your son shall be
done as truly by me as if it concerned another
man's neck i take my leave your
honour
the lady issued her commands and the
old man was ferried over to the shore to
proceed in his extraordinary pilgrimage it
is necessary the reader should accompany
the abbot 
him on his journey which providence had
determined should not be long duration
on arriving at the village the steward
although his disgrace had transpired was
readily accommodated with a horse by the
chamberlain's authority and the roads
being by no means esteemed safe he associated
himself with auchtermuchty the
common carrier in order to travel in his
company to edinburgh
the worthy waggoner according to the
established custom all carriers stagecoachmen
and other persons in such public
authority from the earliest days to the
present never wanted good reasons for
stopping upon the road as often and whereever
he would and the place which had
most captivation for him as a restingplace
was a changehouse as it was termed not
very distant from a romantic dell well
known by the name keirie crags attractions
 a kind very different from those
which arrested the progress john auch
termuchty and his pains still continue to
 the abbot
hover round this romantic spot and none
has visited its vicinity without a desire to
remain long and to return soon
arrived near his favourite howffy not all
the authority dryfesdale much diminished
indeed by the rumours his disgrace
could prevail on the carrier obstinate as
the brutes which he drove to pass on without
his accustomed halt for which the distance
he had travelled furnished little or
no pretence old keltic the landlord
who has bestowed his name on a bridge in
the neighbourhood his quondam dwelling
received the carrier with his usual festive
cordiality and adjourned with him into
the house under pretence important
business which i believe consisted in their
emptying together a mutchkin stoup usquebaugh
while the worthy host and his
guest were thus employed the discarded
steward with a double portion moroseness
in his gesture and look walked discontentedly
into the kitchen the place which
was occupied but by one guest the strange
abbot 
ger was a slight figure scarce above the age
 boyhood and in the dress a page bat
bearing an air haughty aristocratic boldness
and even insolence in his look and manner
that might have made dryfesdale conclude
he had pretensions to superior rank
had not his experience taught him how frequently
these airs superiority were assumed
by the domestics and military retainers
 the scottish nobility the pilgrim's
morning to you old sir said the youth 
 you come as i think from lochleven
castle what news our bonnie queen 
a fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched
a dovecot
 they that speak lochleven and 
those whom its walls contain answered
dryfesdale speak what concerns the
douglas and they who speak what concerns
the douglas do it at their peril
do you speak from fear them old
man or would you make a quarrel for them 
i should have deemed your age might
have cooled your blood
i 
 the abbot
 never while there are eraptypated
coxcombs at each corner to keep it warm
 the sight thy grey hairs keeps mine
cold said the boy who had risen up and
now sat down again
 it is well for thee or i had cooled it
with this hollyrod replied the steward
i think thou best one those swashbucklers
who brawl in alehouses and taverns
 and who if words were pikes and
oaths were andrew ferrara would soon
place the religion babylon in the land
once more and the woman moab upon
the throne
 now by saint bennet seyton said
the youth i will strike thee on the face
thou foulmouthed old railing heretic 
 saint bennet seyton echoed the
steward a proper warrant is saint bennet's
and for a proper nest wolfbirds
like the seytons i will arrest thee as a
traitor to king james and the good regent
ho john auchtermuchty raise aid
against the king's traitor 
the abbot 
so saying he laid his hand on the youth's
collar and drew his sword john auchter
muchty looked in but seeing the naked
weapon ran faster out thane entered keltic
the landlord stood by and helped neither
party only exclaiming gentlemen 
gentlemen for the love heaven and
so forth a struggle ensued in which the
young man chafed atdryfesdale's boldness
and unable with the ease he expected to
extricate himself from the old man's determined
grasp drew his dagger and with the
speed light dealt him three wounds in
the breast and body the least which was
mortal the old man sunk on the ground
with a deep groan and the host set up a
piteous exclamation surprise
 peace ye bawling hound said the
wounded steward are daggerstabs and
dying men such rarities in scotland that
you should cry as if the house were falling 
youth i do not forgive thee for there
is nought betwixt us to forgive thou hast
 the abbot
lone what i have done to more than one 
and i suffer what i have seen them suffer
it was all ordained to be thus and not
otherwise but i thou wouldst do me
right thou wilt send this packet safely to
the hands sir william douglas and
see that my memory suffer not as if i would
have loitered on mine errand for fear my
life
the youth whose passion had subsided
the instant he had done the deed listened
with sympathy and attention when another
person muffled in his cloak entered the
apartment and exclaimed good god 
dryfesdale and expiring 
ay and dryfesdale would that he had
been dead answered the wounded man
 rather than that his ears had heard the
words the only douglas that ever was
false but yet it is better as it is good my
murderer and the rest you stand back
a little and let me speak with this unhappy
apostate kneel down by me master
george you have heard that i failthe
abbot 
ed in my attempt to take away thatmoa
british stumblingblock and her retinue 
i gave them that which i thought would
have removed the temptation out thy
path and this though i had other reasons
to shew to thy mother and others i did
chiefly purpose for the love thee
 for the love me base poisoner 
wouldst thou have committed so horrible
so unprovoked a murder and mentioned
my name with it 
 and wherefore not george dou
glas answered dryfesdale breath is
now scarce with me but i would spend my
last gasp on this argument hast thou not
despite the honour thou west to thy parents
the faith that is due to thy religion
the truth that is due to thy king been so
carried away by the charms this beautiful
sorceress that thou wouldst have helped
her to escape from her prisonhouse and
again to ascend the throne which she had
made a place abomination nay stir not
 the abbot
from me my hand though fast stiffening
has yet force enough to hold thee what
dost thou aim at to wed this witch 
scotland i warrant thee thou mayst succeed
 her heart and hand have been oft
won at a cheaper rate than thou fool that
thou art would think thyself happy to pay
but should a servant thy father's house
have seen thee embrace the fate the
idiot darnley or the villain bothwell 
the fate the murdered fool or the
living pirate while an ounce rat's bane
would have saved thee 
think on god dry festal said george
douglas and leave the utterance those
horrors repent if thou canst if not at
least be silent seyton aid me to support
this dying wretch that he may compose
himself to better thoughts if it be possible
 seyton answered the dying man 
seyton is it by a seyton's hand that i
fall at last there is something retribution
in that since the house had nigh lost
the abbot 
a sister by my deed fixing his fading eyes
on the youth he added he hath her very
features and presence stoop down youth
and let me see thee closer i would know
thee when we meet in yonder world for homicides
will herd together there and i have
been one he pulled seyton's face in
spite some resistance closer to his own
looked at him fixedly and added thou
hast begun young thy career will be the
briefer ay thou wilt be met with and that
anon a young plant never throve that was
watered with an old man's blood yet why
blame i thee strange turns fate he
muttered ceasing to address seyton i
designed what i could not do and he has
done what he did not perchance design 
wondrous that our will should ever oppose
itself to the strong and uncontroulable tide
 destiny that we should strive with the
stream when we might drift with the current
 my brain will serve me to question
it no farther i would schoefferbach were
here yet why i am on a course which
 the abbot
the vessel can hold without a pilots farewell
george douglas i die true to thy
father's house he fell into convulsions
at these words and shortly after expired
seyton and douglas stood looking on the
dying man and when the scene was closed
the former was the first to speak as i
live douglas i meant not this and am sorry
 but he laid hands on me and compelled
me to defend my freedom as i best
might with my dagger if he were ten
times thy friend and follower i can but say
that i am sorry
i blame thee not seyton said douglas
 though i lament the chance there
is an overruling destiny above us though
not in the sense that wretched man who
beguiled by some foreign mystagogue used
the awful word as the ready apology for
whatever he chose to do eve must examine
the packet
they withdrew into an inner room and
remained deep in consultation until they
were disturbed by the entrance keltic
the abbot 
who with an embarrassed countenance asked
master george douglas's pleasure respecting
the disposal the body your
honour knows he added that i make my
bread by living men not by dead corpses 
and old mr dryfesdale who was but a sorry
customer while he was alive occupies my
public room now that he is deceased and
can neither call for ale nor brandy
tie a stone round his neck said seyton
 and when the sun is down have him
to the loch cherish heave him in and
let him alone for finding out the bottom
 under your favour sir said george
douglas it shall not be so keltic thou
art a true fellow to me and ihy having been
so shall advantage thee send or take the
body to the church ballingry and tell
what tale thou wilt his having fallen ina
brawl with some unruly guests thine
auchtermuchty knows nought else nor
are the times so peaceful as to admit close
looking into such accounts
 the abbot
 nay let him tell the truth said seyton
 so far as it harms not our scheme 
say that henry seyton met with him my
good fellow i care not a brass boodle for
the feud
a feud with the douglas was ever to
be feared however said george displeasure
mingling with his natural deep gravity
 manner
not when the best the name is on
my side replied seyton
 alas henry if thou meanest me i
am but half a douglas in this emprize 
half head half heart and half hand but i
will think on one who can never be forgotten
and be all or more than any my
ancestors was ever keltic say it was henry
seyton did the deed j but beware nota
word me let auchtermuchty carry
this packet which he had resealed with
his own signet to my father at edinburgh j
and here is to pay for the funeral expences
and thy loss custom
the abbot 
 and the washing the floor said the
landlord which will be an extraordinary
job for blood they say will scarcely ever
cleanse out
but as for your plan said george 
douglas addressing seyton as if in continuation
 what they had been before treating
 it has a good face j but under your
favour you are yourself too hot and too
young besides other reasons which are much
against your playing the part you propose
we will consult the father abbot upon
it said the youth do you ride to kinross
tonight 
 ay so i purpose answered douglas 
the night will be dark and suits a muff
r 
fled man keltie i forgot there should
be a stone laid on that man's grave recording
his name and his only merit which was
being a faithful servant to the douglas
 what religion was the man said
seyton he used words which made me
fear i have sent satan a subject before his
time
 the abbot
i can tell you little that said george
douglas he was noted for disliking both
rome and geneva and spoke lights he
had learned among the fierce sectaries 
lower germany an evil doctrine it was
if we judge by the fruits god keep us
from presumptuously judging heaven's
secrets 
amen said the young seyton and
from meeting any encounter this evening
 it is not thy wont to pray so said
george douglas
 no leave that to you replied the
youth when you are seized with scruples
 engaging with your father's vassals but
 would fain have this old man's blood off
these hands mine ere i shed more i
will confess to the abbot tonight and i
trust to have light penance for ridding the
earth such a miscreant all i sorrow for
is that he was not a score years younger
 he drew steel first however that is one
comfort

the tenor our tale carries us back to
the castle lochleven where we take up
the order events on the same remarkable
day on which dryfesdale had been dismissed
from the castle it was past noon the
usual hour dinner yet no preparations
seemed made for the queen's entertainment
mary herself was retired into her
own apartment where she was closely engaged
in writing her attendants were together
in the presencechamber and much
 the abbot
disposed to speculate on the delay the
dinner for it may be recollected that their
breakfast had been interrupted i believe
in my conscience said the page
 that having found the poisoning scheme
miscarry by having gone to the wrong merchant
for their deadly wares they are now
about to try how famine will work upon
us
lady fleming was somewhat alarmed at
this surmise but comforted herself by observing
that the chimney the kitchen had
reeked that whole day in a manner which
contradicted the supposition catherine
seyton presently exclaimed they were
bearing the dishes across the court marshalled
by the lady lochleven herself
dressed out in her highest and stiffest ruff
with her partlet and sleeves cyprus and
her huge oldfashioned farthingale crimson
velvet
i believe on my word said the page
approaching the window also it was in
that very farthingale that she captivated
the heart gentle king jamie which prothe
abbot 
cured our poor queen her precious bargain
 a brother
 that may hardly be master roland
answered the lady fleming who was a
great recorder the changes fashion
 since the farthingales came first in when
the queen regent went to saint andrews
after the battle pinkie and were then
called pertains
she would have proceeded farther in this
important discussion but was interrupted
by the entrance the lady lochleven
who preceded the servants bearing the
dishes and formally discharged the duty 
tasting each them lady fleming regretted
in courtly phrase that the lady
 lochleven should have undertaken so
troublesome an office
 after the strange incident this day
madam said the lady it is necessary for
my honour and that my son that i partake
whatever is offered to my involuntary
guest please to inform the lady mary
that i attend her commands
 the abbot
 her majesty replied lady fleming
with due emphasis on the word shall be
informed that the lady lochleven waits
mary appeared instantly and addressed
her hostess with courtesy which even approached
to something more cordial this
is nobly done lady lochleven she said
 for though we ourselves apprehend no
danger under your roof our ladies have
been much alarmed by this morning's
chance and our meal will be the more
cheerful for your presence and assurance
please you to sit down
the lady lochleven obeyed the queen's
commands and roland performed the office
 carver and attendant as usual but
notwithstanding what the queen had said
the meal was silent and unsocial and every
effort which mary made to excite some conversation
died away under the solemn and
chill replies the lady lochleven at
length it became plain that the queen who
had considered her advances as a condense
abbot 
ascension on her part and who piqued herself
justly on her powers pleasing became offended
at the repulsive conduct her hostess
after looking with a significant glance
at lady fleming and catherine she slightly
shrugged her shoulders and remained silent
a pause ensued at the which
the lady douglas spoke i perceive
madam i am a check on the mirth this
fair company i pray you to excuse me 
i am a widow alone here in a most perilous
charge deserted by my grandson 
betrayed by my servant i am little worthy
 the grace you do me in offering me a
seat at your table where i am aware that
wit and pastime are usually expected from
the guests
 if the lady lochleven is serious said
the queen we wonder by what simplicity
she expects our present meals to be seasoned
with mirth if she is a widow she
lives honoured and uncontrouled at the
head her late husband's household but
vol iir k
gl the abbot
i know at least one widowed woman in
the world before whom the words desertion
and betrayal ought never to be mentioned
since no one has been made so bitterly
acquainted with their import
i meant not to remind you your
misfortunes by the mention mine answered
the lady lochleven and there was
again a deep silence
mary at length addressed lady fleming
 we can commit no deadly sins here vut
tonnes where we are so well warded and
looked to but if we could this carthusian
silence might be useful as a kind penance
if thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss my
fleming or if catherine hath made a wry
stitch in her broidery when she was thinking
 something else than her work or if
roland graeme hath missed a wildduck on
the wing and broke a quarrelpane glass
in the turret window as chanced to him
a week since now is the time to think on
your sins and to repent them
 madam i speak with all reverence
the abbot 
said the lady lochleven but i am old
and claim the privilege age methinks
your followers might find fitter subjects for
repentance than the trifles you mention and
so mention once more i crave your pardon
 as if you jested with sin and with repentance
both
you have been our taster lady lochleven
said the queen i perceive you
would eke out your duty with that our
father confessor and since you chuse that
our conversation should be serious may i
ask you why the regent's promise since
your son so styles himself has not been
kept to me in that respect from time to
time this promise has been renewed and
as constantly broken methinks those who
pretend themselves to so much gravity and
sanctity should not debar from others the
religious succours which their consciences
require
 madam the earl murray was indeed
weak enough said the lady lochleven
 to give so far way to your unhappy
 the abbot
prejudices and a religion the pope
presented himself on his part at our town
 kinross but the douglas is lord 
his own castle and will not permit his
threshold to be darkened no not for a single
moment by an emissary belonging to
the bishop rome
 methinks it were well then said mary
 that my lord regent would send me
where there is less scruple and more charity

in this madam answered the lady
lochleven you mistake the nature both
 charity and religion charity giveth
to those who are in delirium the medicaments
which may avail their health but
refuses those enticing cates and liquors
which please the palate but augment the
disease
 this your charity lady lochleven is
pure cruelty under the hypocritical disguise
 friendly care i am oppressed
amongst you as if you meant the destruction
both my body and soul but heath
abbot 
even will not endure such iniquity for ever
and they who are the most active agents in
it may speedily expect their reward
at this moment landau entered the apartment
with a look so much perturbed that
the lady fleming uttered a faint scream
the queen was obviously startled and the
lady lochleven though too bold and
proud to evince any marked signs alarm
asked hastily what was the matter 
dryfesdale has been slain madam
was the reply murdered as soon as he
gained the dry landby young master henry
seyton
it was now catherine's turn to start and
grow pale has the murderer the
douglas's vassal escaped was the lady's
hasty question
there was none to challenge him but
oldkeltie and the carrier auchtermuchty
replied randal unlikely men to slay one
 the racket youths in scotland his
boldest most forward
 the abbot
years and who was sure to have friends and
partakers at no great distance
 was the deed completed said the
lady
 done and done thoroughly said randal
 a seyton seldom strikes twice but
the body was not despoiled and your ho 
your's packet goes forward to edinburgh by
auchtermuchty who leaves keltiebridge
early tomorrow marry he has drunk two
bottles aquavitfe to put the fright out 
his head and now sleeps them off beside
his cart avers t
there was a pause when this fatal tale
was told the queen and lady douglas
looked on each other as if each thought
how she could best turn the incident to her
own advantage in the controversy which
was continually kept alive betwixt them 
catherine seyton kept her kerchief at her
eyes and wept
 you see madam the bloody maxims
and practice the deluded papists said
lady lochleven
the abbot 
nay madam replied the queen
say rather you see the deserved judgment
 heaven upon a calvinistical poisoner
dryfesdale was not the church 
geneva or scotland said the lady
lochleven hastily
he was a heretic however replied
mary there is but one true and unerring
guide the others lead alike into error
well madam i trust it will reconcile
you to your retreat that this deed shews
the temper those who might wish you at
liberty bloodthirsty tyrants and cruel
manquellers are they all from the clanronald
andclantosach in the north to the
ferniherst and buccleuch in the south 
the murdering seytons in the east and
 methinks madam you forget that i
am a seyton said catherine withdrawing
her kerchief from her face which was now
coloured with indignation
if had forgot it fair mistress your
forward bearing would have reminded me
said lady lochleven
 the abbot
 if my brother has slain the villain that
would have poisoned his sovereign and his
sister said catherine am only so far
sorry that he should have spared the hangman
his proper task for aught further
had it been the best douglas in the land
he would have been honoured in falling by
the seyton's sword
farewell gay mistress said the lady
 lochleven rising to withdraw it is
such maidens as you who make giddyfashioned
revellers and deadly brawlers boys
must needs rise forsooth in the grace 
some sprightly damsel who thinks to dance
through life as through a french galliard
she then made her reverence to the queen
and added do you also madam fare you
well till curfew time when i will make
perchance more bold than welcome in attending
upon your supper board come
with me randal and tell me more this
cruel fact
tis an extraordinary chance said the
queen when she had departed and
the abbot 
villain as he was i would this man had been
spared time for repentance we will cause
something to be done for his soul if weever
attain our liberty and the church will
permit such grace to an heretic but tell
me catherine ma mignonne this brother 
thine who is ofracky as the fellow called
him bears he the same wonderful likeness
to thee as formerly 
if your grace means in temper you
know whether lam ofrack as the servingman
spoke him
nay thou art prompt enough in all
reasonable conscience replied the queen 
but thou art my own darling notwithstanding
 but i meant is this thy twinbrother
as like thee in form and features
as formerly i remember thy dear mother
alleged it as a reason for destining thee to
the veil that were ye both to go at large
thou wouldst surely get the credit some
 thy brother's mad pranks
 i believe madam said catherine
 there are some unusually simple people
k 
g the abbot
even yet who can hardly distinguish betwixt
us especially when for diversion's
sake my brother hath taken a female dress
and as she spoke she gave a quick glance
at roland grseme to whom this conversation
conveyed a ray light welcome as
ever streamed into the dungeon a captive
through the door which opened to give
him freedom 
he must be a handsome cavalier this
brother thine if he be so like you replied
mary he was in france i think
for these late years so that i saw him not
at holyrood
his looks madam have never been
much found fault with answered catherine
seyton but i would he had less 
that angry and heady spirit which evil times
have encouraged amongst our young nobles
god knows i grudge not his life in
your grace's quarrel j and love him for the
willingness with which he labours for your
rescue but wherefore should he brawl
with an old ruffianly servingman and stain
the abbot 
at once his name with such a broil and his
hands with the blood an old and ignoble
wretch 
nay be patient catherine i will not
have thee traduce my gallant young knight
with henry for my knight and roland
gramme for my trusty squire methinks i am
like a princess romance who may shortly
set at defiance the dungeons and the weapons
 all wicked sorcerers but my headaches
with the agitation the day take
me la mer des histoires and resume where
we left off on wednesday our lady help
thy head girl or rather may she help thy
heart i asked thee for the sea histories
and thou hast brought la comique
d'armurt
once embarked upon the sea histories
the queen continued her labours with her
needle while lady fleming and catherine
read to her alternately for two hours
as to roland graeme it is probable that
he continued in secret intent upon the chronicle
 love notwithstanding the censure
 the abbot
which the queen seemed to pass upon that
branch study he now remembered a
thousand circumstances voice and manner
which had his own prepossession been
less must surely have discriminated the brother
from the sister and he felt ashamed
that having as it were by heart every particular
 catherine's gestures words and
manners he should have thought her notwithstanding
her spirits and levity capable
cf assuming the bold step loud tones and
forward assurance which accorded well
enough with her brother's hasty and masculine
character he endeavoured repeatedly
to catch a glance catherine's eye
that he might judge how she was disposed
to look upon him since he had made the
discovery but he was unsuccessful for catherine
when she was not reading herself
seemed to take so much interest in the exploits
 the teutonic knights against the
heathens esthonia and livonia that he
could not surprise her eye even for a second
but when closing the the queen comthe
abbot 
landed their attendance in the garden
mary perhaps set purpose for roland's
anxiety could not escape so practised an observer
afforded him a favourable opportunity
 accosting his mistress the queen
commanded them to a little distance while
she engaged lady fleming in a particular
and private conversation the subject whereof
we learn from another authority to have
been the comparative excellence the high
standing ruff and the falling band roland
must have been duller and more sheepish
than ever was youthful lover if he had not
endeavoured to avail himself this opportunity

i have been longing this whole evening
to ask you fair catherine said the
page how foolish and unapprehensive you
must have thought me in being capable to
mistake betwixt your brother and you 
 the circumstance does indeed little honour
to my rustic manners said catherine
since those a wild young man were so
readily mistaken for mine but i shall grow
 the abbot
wiser in time and with that view i am determined
not to think your follies but
to correct my own
 it will be the lighter subject meditation
 the two said roland
 i know not that said catherine very
gravely i fear we have been both unpardonably
foolish
 i have been mad said roland unpardonably
mad but you lovely catherine

 i said catherine in the same tone 
unusual gravity have too long suffered
you to use such expressions towards me 
i fear i can permit it no longer and i blame
myself for the pain it may give you
and what can have happened so suddenly
to change our relation to each other
or alter with such sudden cruelty your
whole deportment to me 
i can hardly tell replied catherine
 unless it is that the events the day have
impressed on my mind the necessity our
observing more distance to each other a
the abbot 
chance similar to that which betrayed to you
the existence my brother may make
known to henry the terms you have used
to me and alas his whole conduct as
well as his deed this day makes me too justly
apprehensive the consequences
 fear nothing for that fair catherine
answered the page i am well able to
protect myself against risks that nature
that is to say replied she that you
would fight with my twinbrother to shew
your regard for his sister i have heard
the queen say in her sad hours that men
are in love or in hate the most selfish animals
 creation and your carelessness in
this matter looks very like it but be not
so much abashed you are no worse than
others
you do me injustice catherine replied
the page i thought but being
threatened with a sword and did not remember
in whose hand your fancy had
placed it if your brother stood before me
with his drawn weapon in his hand so like
 the abbot
as be is to you in word person an favour
he might shed my life'sblood ere i could
find in my heart to resist him to his injury
 alas said she it is not my brother j
alone but you remember only the singular
circumstances in which we have met in equality
and i may say in intimacy you think
not that whenever i reenter my father's
house there is a gulph between us you may
not pass but with peril your life your
only known relative is wild and singular
habits a hostile and broken clan the
rest your lineage unknown forgive me
that i speak what is the undeniable truth
 love my beautiful catherine despises
genealogies answered roman gramme
love may but so will not the lord
seton rejoined the damsel
the queen thy mistress and mine she
will intercede o drive me not from you
at the moment i thought myself most happy
i sand if i shall aid her deliverance said
not yourself that you and she would become
my debtors 
the abbot 
 all scotland will become your debtors
said catherine but for the active
effects you might hope from our gratitude
you must remember i am wholly subjected
to my father and the poor queen is for a
long time more likely to be dependent on
the pleasure the nobles her party
than possessed power to controul them
be it so replied roland my deeds
shall controul prejudice itself it is a bustling
world and i will have my share the
knight avenel high as he now stands
rose from as obscure an origin as mine
 ay said catherine there spoke the
doughty knight romance that will cut
his way to the imprisoned princess through
fiends and fiery dragons
 but i can set the princess at large
and procure her the freedom lier own
choice said the page where dearest catherine
will that choice alight 
 release the princess from dress and
she will tell you said the damsel j and
 the abbot
breaking off the conversation abruptly she
joined the queen so suddenly that mary
exclaimed half aloud
no more tidings evil import no dissention
i trust in my limited household 
then looking on catherine's blushing cheek
and roland's expanded brow and glancing
eye no no she said i see all is
well ma petite mignonne go to my apartment
and fetch me down let me see ay
fetch my pomander box
and having thus disposed her attendant
in the manner best qualified to hide her
confusion the queen added speaking apart
to roland should at least have two grateful
subjects catherine and you for what
sovereign but mary would aid truelove so
willingly ay you lay your hand on your
sword your petite flamherge a rien there
well short time will shew if all the good
be true that is protested to us i hear them
toll curfew from kinross to our chamber
this old dame hath promised to be with
the abbot 
us again at our evening meal were it not
for the hope speedy deliverance her presence
would drive me distracted but i
will be patient
i profess said catherine would i
could be henry with all a man's privileges
for one moment i long to throw my plate
at that confect pride and formality and
illnature
the lady fleming reprimanded her
young companion for this explosion impatience
y the queen laughed and they
went to the presencechamber where almost
immediately entered supper and the
lady the castle the queen strong in
her prudent resolutions endured her presence
with great fortitude and equanimity
until her patience was disturbed by a new
form which had hitherto made no part 
the ceremonial the castle when the
other attendant had retired randal entered
bearing the keys the castle fastened
upon a chain and announcing that the
 the abbot
watch was set and the gates locked delivered
the keys with all reverence to the
lady lochleven
the queen and her ladies exchanged
with each other a look disappointment
anger and vexation and mary said aloud
 we cannot regret the smallness our
court when we see our hostess discharge
in person so many its offices addition
to her charges principal steward 
our household and grani almoner she
has tonight done duty as captain our
guard
and will continue to do so in future
madam answered the lady lochleven
with much gravity the history scotland
may teach me how ill the duty is performed
which is done by an accredited deputy
 we have heard madam favourites
 later date and as little merit as oliver
sinclair
 o madam replied the queen my
father had his female as well as his male fathe
abbot 
favourites there were the ladies sandilandsv
and olifaiint and some others methinks 
but their names cannot survive in the memory
 so grave a person as you
the lady lochleven looked as if she
could have slain the queen on the spot but
commanded her temper and retired from
the apartment bearing in her hand the ponderous
bunch keys
now god be praised for that vioman's
youthful frailty said the queen had she
not that weak point io her character i might
waste my words on her in vain but that
stain is the very reverse what is said 
the witch's mark i can make her feel there
though she is otherwise insensible all over
but how say you girls here is a new
difficulty how are these keys to be come
by there is no deceiving or bribing this
dragon i trow
may i crave to know said roland
 whether if your grace were beyond the
walls the castle you could find means 
 the abbot
conveyance to the firm land and protection
when you are there
trust us for that roland said the
queen for to that point our scheme is
indifferent well laid
then if your grace will permit me to
speak my mind i think i could be some
use in this matter
 as how my good youth speak on
said the queen and fearlessly
 my patron the knight avenel used
to compel the youth educated in his household
to learn the use axe and hammer
and working in wood and iron he used to
speak old northern champions who forged
their own weapons and the highland
captain donald nan ord or donald
 the hammer whom he himself knew
and who used to work at the anvil with a
sledgehammer in each hand some said
he praised this art because he was himself
 churl's blood however i gained some
practice in it as the lady catherine sey ton
the abbot 
partly knows for since we were here i
wrought her a silver broach
ay replied catherine but you
should tell her grace that your workmanship
was so indifferent that it broke to pieces
next day and i flung it away
 believe her not roland said the
queen she wept when it was broken
and put the fragments into her bosom but
for your scheme could your skill avail to
forge a second set keys 
no madam because i know not the
wards but i am convinced i could make
a set so like that hateful bunch which the
lady bore off even now that could they be
exchanged against them by any means she
would never dream she was possessed the
wrong
and the good dame thank heaven is
somewhat blind said the queen but
then for a forge my boy and the means 
labouring unobserved 
 the armourer's forge at which i used
sometimes to work with him is in the round
 the abbot
vault at the bottom the turret he was
dismissed with the warder for being supposed
too much attached to george douglas
the people are accustomed to see me work
there and i will find some excuse that will
pass current with them for putting bellows
and anvil to work
 the scheme has a promising face said
the queen about it my lad with all speed
and beware the nature your work is not
discovered
nay i will take the liberty to draw the
bolt against chance visitors so that i will
have time to put away what am working
upon before i undo the door
 will not that itself attract suspicion
in a place where it is so current already 
said catherine
 not a whit replied roland j gregory
the armourer and every good hamgerman
locks himself in when he is about
some masterpiece craft besides something
must be risked
the abbot 
part we then tonight said the queen
and god bless you my children if
mary's head ever rises above water you
shall all arise along with her
vol il
 the abb or
chapter viii
it is a time danger not revel
when churchmen turn masquers
spanish father
the enterprize roland grseme appeared
to prosper a trinket or two which
the work did not surpass the substance for
the materials were silver supplied by the
queen were judiciously presented to those
most likely to be inquisitive into the labours
 the forge and anvil which they thus were
induced to reckon profitable to others and
harmless in itself openly the page was
seen working about such trifles in private
he forged a number keys resembling so
nearly in weight and in form those which
were presented every evening to the lady
lochleven that on a slight inspection it
would have been difficult to perceive the
the abbot 
difference he brought them to the dark
rusty colour by the use salt and water 
and in the triumph his art presented
them at length to queen mary in her 
about an hour before the
tolling the curfew she looked at them
with pleasure but at the same time with
doubts i allow she said that the
lady lochleven's eyes which are not 
the clearest may be well deceived could
we pass those keys on her in place the
real implements her tyranny but how
is this to be done and which my little
court dare attempt this tour de jongleur
with any chance success could we but
engage her in some earnest matter argument
 but those which i hold with her
always have been a kind which make her
grasp her keys the faster as if she said to
herself here i hold what sets me above
your taunts and reproaches and even for
her liberty mary stuart could not stoop to
speak the proud heretic fairwhat shall
we do shall lady fleming try her elo
 the abbot
quench in describing the last new headtire
from paris alas the good dame has
not changed the fashion her head gear
since pinkiefield for aught that i know
shall my mignonne catherine sing to her
one those touching airs which draw the
very souls out me and roland graeme 
alas dame margaret douglas would rather
hear a huguenot psalm sung to the tune 
reveilles vous helle endormie cousins and
liege counsellors what is to be done for
our wits are really astray in this matter 
must our manatarms and the champion 
our body roland graeme manfully assault
the old lady and take the keys from her
par vote du fait v
nay with your grace's permission
said roland i doubt not to manage the
matter with more discretion for though in
your grace's service i do not fear
 a host old women interrupted catherine
 each armed with rock and spindle
yet he has no fancy for pikes and partizans

the abbot 
 they that do not fear fair ladies
tongues continued the page need dread
nothing else but gracious liege i am
well nigh satisfied that i could pass the
exchange these keys on the lady lochleven
 but i dread the sentinel who is now
planted nightly in the garden which by
necessity we must traverse
our last advices from our friend on the
shore have promised us assistance in that
matter replied the queen
and is your grace well assured the
fidelity and watchfulness those without v
 for their fidelity i will answer with
my life and for their vigilance i will answer
with my lifei will give thee instant
proof my faithful roland that they are ingenious
and trusty as thyself come hither
 nay catherine attend us we carry
not so deft a page into our private chamber
alone make fast the door the parlour
fleming and warn us if you hear the
least step or stay go thou to the door
catherine in a whisper thy ears and thy
 the abbot
wits are both sharper good fleming attend
us thyself and again she whispered
her reverend presence will be as safe a
watch on roland as thine can so be not
jealous mignonne
thus speaking they were lighted by the
lady fleming into the queen's bedroom
a small apartment enlightened by a projecting
window
 look from that window roland she
said see you amongst the several lights
which begin to kindle and to glimmer palely
through the grey the evening from the
village kinross seest thou i say one
solitary spark apart from the others and
nearer it seems to the verge the water 
it is no brighter at this distance than the
torch the poor glowworm and yet my
good youth that light is more dear to mary
stuart than every star that twinkles in the
blue vault heaven by that signal i
know that more than one true heart are
plotting my deliverance and without that
consciousness and the hope freedom it
the abbot 
gives me i had long since stooped to my
fate and died a broken heart plan after
plan has been formed and abandoned but
still the light glimmers and while it glimmers
my hope lives o how many evenings
have i sat musing in despair over our
ruined schemes and scarce hoping that i
should again see that blessed signal when it
has suddenly kindled and like the lights 
saint elms in a tempest brought hope and
consolation where there was only dejection
and despair 
 if i mistake not answered roland
 tlie candle shines from the house 
the mail gardener
 thou hast a good eye said the queen 
it is there where my trusty lieges god
and the saints pour blessings on them 
hold consultation for my deliverance the
voice a wretched captive would die on
these blue waters long ere it could mingle
in their councils and yet i can hold communication
 i will confide the whole to
s the abbot
thee i am about to ask those faithful
friends if the moment for the great attempt
is nigh place the lamp in the window fleming

she obeyed and immediately withdrew
it no sooner had she done so than the
light in the cottage the gardener disappeared

 now count said queen mary for
my heart beats so thick that i cannot count
myself
the lady fleming began deliberately to
count one two three and when she had arrived
at ten the light on the shore again
shewed its pale twinkle
now our lady be praised said the
queen it was but two nights since that
the absence the light remained while i
could tell thirty the hour deliverance
approaches may god bless those who labour
in it with such truth to me alas 
with such hazard to themselves and bless
you too my children come we must to
the abbot 
the audiencechamber again our absence
might excite suspicion should they serve
the supper
they returned to the presencechamber
and the evening concluded as usual
the next morning at dinnertime an
unusual incident occurred while lacy
douglas loehleven performed her daily
duty assistant and taster at the queen's
table she was told a manetarms had arrived
recommended by her son but without
any letter or other token than what he
brought by word mouth
hath he given you that token demanded
the lady
 he reserved it as i think for your
ladyship's ear replied randal
 he doth well said the lady tell
him to wait in the hall but no with your
permission madam to the queen let him
attend me here
 since you are pleased to receive your
domestics in my presence said the queen
i cannot chuse 
l 
 the abbot
 my infirmities must plead my excuse
madam replied the lady the life i must
lead here ill suits with the years which have
passed over my head and compels me to
waive ceremonial
 o my good lady replied the queen
 i would there were nought in this your
castle more strongly compulsive than the
cobweb chains ceremony but bolts and
bars are harder matters to contend with
as she spoke the person announced by
randal entered the room and roland
gramme at once recognized in him the abbot
ambrosius
what is your name good fellow said
the lady
edward glendinning answered the
abbot with a suitable reverence
 art thou the blood the knight
 avenel said the lady lochleven
ay madam and that nearly replied
the pretended soldier
 it is likely enough said the lady for
the knight is the son his own good works
the abbot 
and has risen from obscure lineage to this
present high rank in the estate but he is
 sure truth and approved worth and his
kinsman is welcome to us you hold unquestionably
the true faith 
do not doubt it madam said the
disguised churchman
hast thou a token to me from sir william
douglas said the lady
 i have madam replied he but it
must be said in private
thou art right said the lady moving
towards the recess a window say in
what does it consist 
 in the words an old bard replied
the abbot
 repeat them answered the lady and
he uttered in a low tone the lines from an
old poem called the howlet 
o douglas douglas
tender and true
 trusty sir john holland i said the
lady douglas apostrophizing the poet
 the abbot
a kinder heart never inspired a rhine
and the douglas's honour was ever on thy
harp string we receive you among our
followers glendinning but randal see
that he keep the after ward only till we
shall hear more touching him from our son
thou dearest not the nightair blending

 in the cause the lady before whom
i stand i fear nothing madam answered
the disguised abbot
 our garrison then is stronger by one
trust worthy soldiers said the matron 
go to the buttery and let them make
much thee
when the lady lochleven had retired
the queen said to roland graeme who was
now almost constantly in her company i
spy comfort in that stranger's countenance y
i know not why it should be so but i am
well persuaded he is a friend
 your grace's penetration does not deceive
you answered the page and he informed
her that the abbot saint mary's
the abbot s
himself played the part the newly arrived
soldier
the queen crossed herself and looked
upwards unworthy sinner that i am
she said that for my sake a man so holy
and so high in spiritual office should wear
the garb a base shorter and run the risk
 dying the death a traitor 
 heaven will protect its own servant
madam said catherine seyton his aid
would bring a blessing on our undertaking
were it not already blest for its own sake
 what i admire in my spiritual father
said roland was the steady front with
which he looked on me without giving the
least sign former acquaintance i did
not think the like was possible since i have
ceased to believe that henry was the same
person with catherine
 but marked you not how studiously
the good father said the queen eluded
the questions the woman lochleven telling
her the very truth which yet she received
not as such 
t the abbot
roland thought in his heart that when
the truth was spoken for the purpose deceiving
it was little better than a lie in disguise
but it was no time to agitate such
questions conscience
and now for the signal from the shore
exclaimed catherine my bosom tells me
we shall see this night two lights instead 
one gleam from that garden eden and
then roland do you play your part manfully
and we will dance on the greensward
like midnight fairies 
catherine's conjecture misgave not nor
deceived her in the evening two beams
twinkled from the cottage instead one 
and the page heard with beating heart that
the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel
on the outside the castle when
he intimated this news to the queen she
held her hand out to him he knelt and
when he raised it to his lips in all dutiful
homage he found it was damp and cold as
marble for god's sake madam droop
not now sink not now
the abbot 
 call upon our lady my liege said
the lady flemings call upon your tutelar
saint
 call the spirits the hundred kings
you are descended from exclaimed the
page in this hour need the resolution
 a monarch were worth the aid a hundred
saints
o roland grseme said mary in a
tone deep despondency be true tome
 many have been false to me alas i
have not always been true to myself my
mind misgives me that i shall die in bondage
and that this bold attempt will cost
all our lives it was foretold me by a soothsayer
in france that i should die in prison
and by a violent death and here comes the
hour o would to god it found me prepared

 madam said catherine seyton remember
you are a queen better we all
died in bravely attempting to gain our freedom
than remained here to be poisoned as
 the abbot
men rid them the noxious vermin that
haunt old houses
 you are right catherine said the
queen and mary will bear her like herself
but alas your young and buoyant
spirit can ill spell the causes which have
broken mine forgive me my children
and farewell for a while i will prepare
both mind and body for this awful venture

they separated till again called together
by the tolling the curfew the queen
appeared grave but firm and resolved the
lady fleming with the art an experienced
courtier knew perfectly how to disguise
her inward tremors catherine's eye
was fired as if with the boldness the project
and the half smile which dwelt upon
her beautiful mouth seemed to contemn all
the risk and all the consequences discovery
 roland who felt how much success
depended on his own address and boldness
summoned together his whole pre
the abbot st
sence mind and if he found his spirits
flag for a moment cast his eye upon catherine
whom he thought he had never
seen look so beautiful i may be foiled
he thought but with this reward in prospect
they must bring the devil to aid them
ere they cross me thus resolved he stood
like a greyhound in the slips with hand
heart eye intent upon making and seizing
opportunity for the execution their project

the keys had with the wonted ceremonial
been presented to the lady cochlea
she stood with her back to the casement
which like that the queen's apartment
commanded a view kinross with
the church which stands at some distance
fiom the town and nearer to the lake
then connected with the town by straggling
cottages with her back to this casement
then and her face to the table on
which the keys lay for an instant while she
tasted the various dishes which were placed
 the abbot
there stood the lady lochleven more
provokingly intent than usual so at least
it seemed to her prisoners upon the huge
and heavy bunch iron the implements 
their restraint just when having finished
her ceremony as taster the queen's table
she was about to take up the keys the
page who stood beside her and had handed
her the dishes in succession looked sideways
to the churchyard and exclaimed he
saw corpse candles in the churchyard the
lady lochleven was not without a touch
though a slight one the superstitions 
the time the fate her sons made her
alive to omens and a corpselight as it was
called in the family burialplace boded
death she turned her head towards the
casement saw a distant glimmering forgot
her charge for one second and in that
second were lost the whole fruits her
former vigilance the page held the forged
keys under his cloak and with great dexterity
exchanged them for the real ones
his utmost address could not prevent a
the abbot 
slight clash as he took up the latter bunch
who touches the keys said the lady 
and while the page answered that the sleeve
 his cloak had stirred them she looked
round possessed herself the bunch which
now occupied the place the genuine keys
and again turned to gaze at the supposed
corpsecandles
i hold these gleams she said after a
moment's consideration to come not
from the churchyard but from the hut 
the old gardener blinkhoolie i wonder
what thrift that churl drives that late he
hath ever had light in his house till the
night grew deep i thought him an industrious
peaceful man if he turns resented
 idle companions and nightwalkers
the place must be rid him
 he may work his baskets perchance
said the page desirous to stop the train 
her suspicion
or nets may he not answered the
lady
 the abbot
ay madam said roland for trout
and salmon
 or for fools and knaves replied the
lady but this shall be looked after tomorrow
i wish your grace and your company
a good evening randal attend us
and randal who waited in the antichamber
after having surrendered his bunch 
keys gave his escort to his mistress as usual
while leaving the queen's apartments she
retired to her own
tomorrow said the page rubbing
his hands with glee as he repeated the lady's
last words fools look to tomorrow and
wise folk use tonight may i pray you
my gracious liege to retire for one half
hour until all the castle is composed to rest
i must go and rub with oil these blessed
implements our freedom courage and
constancy and all will go well providing
our friends on the shore fail not to send the
boat you spoke 
 fear them not said catherine they
the abbot 
are true as steel if our dear mistress do
but maintain her noble and royal courage
doubt not me catherine replied the
queen a while since i was overborne
but i have recalled the spirit my earlier
and more sprightly days when i used to
accompany my armed nobles and wish to
be myself a man to know what life it was
to be in the fields with sword and buckler
jack and knapsack
 o the lark lives not a gayer life nor
sings a lighter and gayer song than the
merry soldier answered catherine your
jrace shall be in the midst them soon
and the look such a liege sovereign will
make each your host worth three in the
hour need but i must to my task
 we have but brief time said queen
mary one the two lights in the cottage
is extinguished that shows the boat is put
off
they will row very slow said the
page or kent where depth permits to
is
 the abbot
avoid noise to our several gear i will
communicate with the good father
at the dead hour midnight when all
was silent in the castle the page put the
key into the lock the wicket which opened
into the garden and which was at the
bottom a staircase that descended from
the queen's apartment now turn smooth
and softly thou good bolt said he if
ever oil softened rust and his precautions
had been so effectual that the bolt revolved
with little or no sound resistance he
ventured not to cross the threshold but exchanging
a word with the disguised abbot
asked if the boat were ready
this half hour said the sentinel she
lies beneath the wall too close under the
islet to be seen by the warder but i fear
she will hardly escape his notice in putting
off again
the darkness said the page and
our profound silence may take her off unobserved
as she came in hildebrand has
the abbot 
the watch on the tower a heavyheaded
knave who holds a can ale to be the best
headpiece upon a nightwatch he sleeps
for a wager
 then bring the queen said the abbot
and i will call henry seyton to assist
them to the boat
on tiptoe with noiseless step and suppressed
breath trembling at every rustle 
their own apparel one after another the fair
prisoners glided down the winding stair
under the guidance roland grime and
were received at the wicketgate by henry
seyton and the churchman the former
seemed instantly to take upon himself the
whole direction the enterprize my
lord abbot he said give my sister your
armi will conduct the queensland the
youth will have the honour to guide lady
fleming
this was no time to dispute the arrangement
although it was not that which roland
graeme would have chosen catherine
seyton who well knew the garden path
 the abbot
tripped on before like a sylph rather leading
the abbot than receiving assistance 
the queen her native spirit prevailing over
female fear and a thousand painful reflections
moved steadily forward by assistance
 henry seyton while the lady fleming
encumbered with her fears and her helplessness
roland graeme who followed in the
rear and who bore under the other arm a
packet necessaries belonging to the queen
the door the garden which communicated
with the shore the islet yielded to one
 the keys which roland had possessed
himself although not until he had tried several
 a moment anxious terror and expectation
the ladies were then partly led
partly carried to the side the lake where a
boat with six rowers attended them the men
couched along the bottom to secure them
from observation henry seyton placed
the queen in the stern the abbot offered
to assist catherine but she was seated by
the queen's side before he could utter his
proffer help j and roland graeme was
the abbot 
just lifting lady fleming over the boatside
when a thought suddenly occurred to
him and exclaiming forgotten forgotten
 wait me but one half minute he replaced
on the shore the helpless lady the
bedchamber threw the queen's packet into
the boat and sped back through the garden
with the noiseless speed a bird on the
wing
 by heaven he is false at last said
seyton i ever feared it 
 he is as true said catherine as
heaven itself and that i will maintain
 be silent minion said her brother
for shame if not for fear fellows put off
and row for your lives
help me help me on board i said the
deserted lady fleming and that louder
than prudence warranted
put off put off cried henry seyton 
leave all behind so the queen is safe
will you permit this madam said
catherine imploringly you leave your
deliverer to death
vol ni m
 the abbot
i will not said the queen seton
i command you to stay at every risk
 pardon me madam if i disobey said
the intractable young man and with one
hand lifting in lady fleming he begun
himself to push off the boat
she was two fathoms length from the
shore and the rowers were getting her
head round when roland graeme arriving
bounded from the beach and attained the
boat overturning seyton on whom he
lighted the youth swore a deep but suppressed
oath and stopping grseme as he
stepped towards the stern said your
place is not with highborn dames keep at
the head and trim the vessel now give
way give way row for god and the
queen 
the rowers obeyed and began to puh
vigorously
why did ye not muffle the oars said
island graeme the dash must awaken
the sentinel row lads and get out 
shot for had not old hildebrand the warthe
abbot 
dep supped upon poppyporridge this
whispering must have waked him
 it was all thine own delay said seyton
 thou shalt reckon with me hereafter
for that and other matters
but roland's apprehension was verified
too instantly to permit him to reply the
dentine whose slumbering had withstood
the whispering was alarmed by the dash 
the oars his challenge was instantly
heard a boat a boat bring to or i
shoot and as they continued to ply their
oar he called aloud treason treason 
rung the bell the castle and discharged
his marquess at the boat the ladies
crowded on each other like startled wildfowl
at the flash and report the piece
while the men urged the rowers to the utmost
speed they heard more than one
ball whiz along the surface the lake at
no great distance from their httle bark and
from the lights which glanced like meteors
from window to window it was evident
 the abbot
the whole castle was alarmed and their escape
discovered
pull again exclaimed seyton stretch
to your oars or i will spur you to the task
with my dagger they will launch a boat
immediately
that is cared for said roland i
locked gate and wicket on them when i
went back and no boat will stir from the
island this night if doors good oak and
bolts iron can keep men within stonewalls
 and now i resign my office 
porter lochleven and give the keys to
the kelpie's keeping
as the heavy keys plunged in the lake
the abbot who till then had been repeating
his prayers exclaimed now bless
thee my son for thy ready prudence puts
shame on us all
 knew said mary drawing her breath
more freely as they were now out reach
 the musketry knew my squire's
truth promptitude and sagacity i must
the abbot 
have him dear friends with my no less
true knights douglas and seaton but
where then is douglas 
 here madam answered the deep and
melancholy voice the boatman who sate
next her and who acted as steersman
alas was it you who stretched your
body before me said the queen when
the balls were raining around us 
 believe you said he in a low tone
that douglas would have resigned to anyone
the chance protecting his queen's
life with his own
the dialogue was here interrupted by a
shot or two from one those small pieces
 artillery called falconets then used in
defending castles the shot was too vague
to have any effect but the broader flash
the deeper sound the louder return which
was made by the midnight echoes benparty
terrified and imposed silence on the
liberated prisoners the boat was alongside
 a rude quay or landing place running
out from a garden considerable 
the abbot
tent ere any them again attempted to
speak they landed and while the abbot
returned thanks aloud to heaven which
had thus far favoured their enterprise douglas
enjoyed the best reward his desperate
undertaking in conducting the queen
to the house the gardener yet not unmindful
 roland graeme even in that
moment terror and exhaustion mary
expressly commanded seyton to give his
assistance to fleming while catherine voluntarily
and without bidding took the arm
 the page seyton presently resigned
lady fleming to the care the abbot
alleging he must look after their horses 
and his attendants disencumbering themselves
 their boatcloaks hastened to assist
him
while mary spent in the gardener's cottage
the few minutes which were necessary
to prepare the steeds for their departure
she perceived in a corner the old man to
whom the garden belonged and called him
th abbot 
ta approach he came as it were with reluctance

 how brother said the abbot so slow
to welcome thy royal queen and mistress
to liberty and to her kingdom 
the old man thus admonished came forward
and in good terms speech gave
her grace joy her deliverance the
queen returned him thanks in the most
gracious manner and added it will remain
to us to after some immediate reward
for your fidelity for we wot well your hous
has been long the refuge in which our trusty
servants have met to concert measures for
our freedom so saying she offered gold
and added we will consider your services
more fully hereafter
kneel brother said the abbot kneel
instantly and thank her grace's kindness
 good brother that wert once a few
steps under me and art still many years
younger replied the gardener pettishly
 let me do mine acknowledgments in my
own way queens have knelt to me ere
 the abbot
now and in truth my knees are too old and
stiff to bend even to this lovelyfaced lady
may it please your grace if your grace's
servants have occupied my house so that i
could not call it mine own if they have
trodden down my flowers in the zeal 
their midnight comings and goings and destroyed
the hope the fruit season by
bringing their warhorses into my garden i
do but crave your grace in requital
that you will chuse your residence as far
from me as possible i am an old man
who would willingly creep to my grave as
easily as he can in peace good will and
quiet labour
 and
with whom art thou brawling unless my
n
 the abbot
eyes spell that token false it is with the
very youth who aided me so gallantly in
the skirmish with the leslie let me look
fair youth at the medal which thou dearest
in thy cap by saint bennet it is the
same henry i command thee to forbear
him as thou lowest my blessing
and as you honour my command said
the queen good service hath he done
me
ay madam replied young seyton
as when he carried the billet inclosed in
the swordsheath to lochleven marry the
good youth knew no more than a packhorse
what he was carrying
but i who dedicated him to this great
work said magdalen grasme i by
whose advice and agency this just heir hath
been unloosed from her thraldom i who
spared not the last remaining hope a falling
house in this great action i at least
knew and counselled and what merit maybe
mine let the reward most gracious
queen descend upon this youth my mithe
abbot 
ministry here is ended you are free a sovereign
princess at the head a gallant
army surrounded by valiant barons my
service could avail you no farther but
might well prejudice you your fortune
now rests upon men's hearts and men's
swords may they prove as trusty as the
faith women 
you will not leave us mother said
the queen you whose practices in our
favour were so powerful who dared so
many dangers and wore so many disguises
to blind our enemies and to confirm our
friends you will not leave us in the dawn
 our reviving fortunes ere we have time
to know and to thank you 
you cannot know her answered magdalen
greene who knows not herself 
there are times when in this woman's frame
 mine there is the strength him 
gath in this overtoiled brain the wisdom
 the most sage counsellor and again the
mist is on me and my strength is veak
 the abbot
ness my wisdom folly i have spoken before
princes and cardinals ay noble princess
even before the princes thine own
house lorraine and i know not whence
the words persuasion came which flowed
from my lips and were drunk in by
their ears and now even when i most
need words persuasion there is something
which choaks my voice and robs me
 utterance
if there be aught in my power to do
thee pleasure said the queen the barely
naming it shall avail as well as all thine
eloquence
 sovereign lady replied the enthusiast
 it shames me that at this high moment
something human frailty should
cling to one whose vows the saints have
heard whose labours in the rightful cause
heaven has prospered but it will be thus
while the living spirit is shrine in the clay
 mortality i will yield to the folly she
said weeping as she spoke and it shall
the abbot 
be the last then seizing roland's hand
she led him to the queen's feet kneeling
herself upon one knee and causing him to
kneel on both mighty princess she
said look on this flower it was found
by a kindly stranger on a bloody field 
battle and long it was ere my anxious eyes
saw and my arms pressed all that was left
 my only daughter for your sake and
for that the holy faith we both profess
i could leave this plant while it was yet
tender to the nurture strangers ay
 enemies to whom perchance his blood
would have been as wine had the heretic
glendinning known that he had in his
house the heir julian avenel since
then i have seen him only in a few hours
 doubt and dread and now i part with
the child my love for ever for ever 
o for every weary step i have made in
your rightful cause in this and in foreign
lands give protection to the child whom i
must no more call mine 
 the abbot
i swear to you mother said the
queen deeply affected that for your
sake and his own his happiness and fortunes
shall be our charge 
i thank you daughter princes said
magdalen and pressed her lips first to the
queen's hand then to the brow her
grandson and now she said drying
her tears and rising with dignity earth
has had its own and heaven claims the
rest lioness scotland go forth and
conquer and if the prayers a devoted
votaress can avail thee they will rise in
many a land and from many a distant
shrine i will glide like a ghost from land
to land from temple to temple and where
the very name my country is unknown
the priests shall ask who is the queen 
that distant northern land for whom the
aged pilgrim was so fervent in prayer farewell
 honour be thine and earthly prosperity
if it be the will god if not may
the penance thou shalt do here ensure thee
the abbot 
happiness hereafter let no one speak or
follow me my resolution is taken my
vow cannot be cancelled
she glided from their presence as she
spoke and her last look was upon her beloved
grandchild he would have risen
and followed but the queen and lord
seyton interfered
press not on her now said lord seyton
 if you would not lose her for ever
many a time have we seen the sainted mother
and often at the most needful moment
 but to press on her privacy or to
thwart her purpose is a crime which she
cannot pardon i trust we shall yet see herat
her need a holy woman she is for certain
and dedicated wholly to prayer and
penance and hence the heretics hold her
as distracted while catholics deem her a
saint
let me then hope said the queen
that you my lord will aid me in the execution
 her last request
 the abbot
what in the protection my young
second cheerfully that is in all that your
majesty can think it fitting to ask me 
henry give thy hand ripon the instant to
roland avenel for so i presume he must
now be called
and shall be lord the barony
said the queen if god prosper our rightful
arms
it can only be to restore it to my kind
protectress who now holds it said young
avenel i would rather be landless all
my life than she lost a rood ground by
me
nay said the queen looking to lord
seyton his mind matches his birth 
henry thou hast not yet given thy hand
it is his said henry giving it with
some appearance courtesy but whispering
roland at the same time for all
this thou hast not my sister's
may it please your grace said lord
seyton now that these passages are over
the abbot 
to honour our poor meal time it were
that our banners were reflected in the
clyde we must to horse with as little
stop as may be
 the abbot
chapter x
ay sir our ancient crown in these wild times
oft stood upon a cast the gamester's ducat
so often staked and lost and then regain'd
scarce knew so many hazards
the spanish father
it is not our object to enter into the historical
part the reign the illfated mary
or to recount how during the week which
succeeded her flight from lochleven her
partizans mustered around her with their
followers forming a gallant army amounting
to six thousand men so much light
has been lately thrown on the most minute
details the period by mr chalmers in his
valuable history queen mary that the
reader may be safely referred to it for the
most full information which ancient records
afford concerning that interesting time it
the abbot 
is sufficient for our purpose to say that
while mary's headquarters were at hamilton
the regent and his adherents had in
the king's name assembled a host at glasgow
inferior indeed to that the queen
in numbers but formidable from the military
talents murray morton the laird
 grange and others who had been trained
from their youth in foreign and domestic
wars
in these circumstances it was the obvious
policy queen mary to avoid a conflict
secure that were her person once in
safety the number her adherents must
daily increase whereas the forces those
opposed to her must as had frequentlyhap
opened in the previous history her reign
have diminished and their spirits become
broken and so evident was this to her
counsellors that they resolved their first
step should be to place the queen in the
strong castle dumbarton there to await
the course events the arrival succours
from france and the levies which
a the abbot
were made by her adherents in every province
 scotland accordingly orders
were given that all men should be on horseback
or on foot apparelled in their armour
and ready to follow the queen's standard
in array battle the avowed determination
being to escort her to the castle 
dumbarton in defiance her enemies
the muster was made upon hamiltonmoor
and rhe march commenced in all the
pomp feudal times military music sounded
banners and pennons waved armour
glittered far and wide and spears glanced
and twinkled like stars in a frosty sky the
gallant spectacle warlike parade was ou
this occasion dignified by the presence 
the queen herself who with a fair retinue
 ladies and household attendants and a
special guard gentlemen amongst whom
young seyton and roland were distinguished
gave grace at once and confidence to
the army which spread its ample filesbefore
around and behind her many churchmen
also joined the cavalcade most whom did
the abbot 
not scruple to assume arms and declare
their intention wielding them in defence
 mary and the catholic faith not so the
abbot saint mary's roland lead not
seen this prelate since the night their
escape from lochleven and he now beheld
him robed in the dress his order assume
his station near the queen's person roland
hastened to pull off his basket and beseech
the abbot's blessing
thou hast it my son said the priest 
i see thee now under thy true name and
in thy rightful garb the helmet with the
holly branch befits your brows well i have
long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume
it
 then you knew my descent my
good father said roland
 i did so but it was under seal confession
from thy grandmother nor was i
at liberty to tell the secret till she herself
should make it known
 her reason for such secrecy my father
 said roland avenel
 the abbot
 fear perchance my brother amistaken
fear for halbert would not to ensure
himself a kingdom wrong an orphan j
besides that your title in quiet times even
had your father done your mother that justice
which i well hope he did could not
have competed with that my brother's
wife the child julian's elder brother
they need fear no competition from
mesaidavenel scotland is wide enough
and there are many manors to win without
plundering my benefactor but prove tome
my reverend father that my father was
just to my mother shew me that i may
call myself a legitimate avenel and make
me your bounden slave for ever
 ay replied the abbot i hear the
seytons hold thee cheap for that stain on
thy shield something however i have
learnt from the late abbot boniface which
if it prove sooth may redeem that reproach

tell me that blessed news said roland
 and the future service my life
the abbot 
rash boy said the abbot i should
but madden thine impatient temper by exciting
hopes that may never be fulfilled 
and is this a time for them think on what
perilous march we are bound and if thou
hast a sin unconfessed neglect not the only
leisure which heaven may perchance afford
thee for confession and absolution
there will be time enough for both i
trust when we reach dumbarton answered
the page
ay said the abbot thou lowest
as loudly as the rest but we are not yet at
dumbarton and there is a lion in the path
mean you murray morton and the
other rebels at glasgow my reverend father
tush they dare not look on the royal
banner
even so replied the abbot speak
many those who are wiser than thou i
have returned from the southern shires
where i left many a chief name arming
in the queen's interest i left the lords
 the abbot
here wise and considerate men i find them
madmen on my return they are willing for
mere pride and vain glory to brave the
enemy and to carry the queen as it were
in triumph past the walls glasgow and
under the beards the adverse army 
seldom does heaven smile on such mistimed
confidence we shall be encountered
and that to the purpose
 and so much the better replied roland
 the field battle was my cradle
 beware it be not thy dyingbed said
the abbot but what avails it whispering
to young wolves the dangers the chace 
you will know perchance ere this day is
out what yonder men are whom you hold
in rash contempt
why what are they said henry seyton
who now joined them have they sinews
 wire and flesh iron will lead
pierce and steel cut them if so reverent
father we have little to fear
they are evil men said the abbot
the abbot s
but the trade war demands no saints
murray and morton are known to be the
best generals in scotland no one ever saw
lindsay or ruthven's back kirkaldy 
grange was named by the constable montmorency
the first soldier in europe my
brother too good a name for such a cause
has been far and wide known for a soldier
 the better the better said seyton
triumphantly we shall have all these traitors
 rank and name in a fair field before
us our cause is the best our numbers are
the strongest our hearts and limbs match
theirs saint bennet and set on 
the abbot made no reply but seemed
lost in reflection and his anxiety in some
measure communicated itself to roland
avenel who ever as their line march led
over a ridge or an eminence cast an anxious
look towards the towers glasgow as
if he expected to see symptoms the enemy
issuing forth it was not that he feared
the fight but the issue was such deep
vol iii o
 the abbot
import to his country and to himself that
the natural fire his spirit burned with a
less lively though with a more intense glow
love honour fame fortune all seemed to
depend on the issue one field rashly hazarded
perhaps but now likely to become
unavoidable
when at length their march came to be
nearly parallel with the city glasgow
roland became sensible that the high
grounds before them were already in part
occupied by a force shewing like their own
the royal banner scotland and on the
point being supported by columns infantry
and squadrons horse which the
city gates had poured forth and which hastily
advanced to sustain those troops who
already possessed the ground in front the
queen's army horseman after horseman
galloped in from the advanced guard with
tidings that murray had taken the field
with his whole army that his object was to
intercept the queen's march and his purpose
unquestionable to hazard a battle it
the abbot 
was now that the tempers men were subjected
to a sudden and a severe trial and
that those who had too presumptuously concluded
that they would pass without combat
were something disconcerted when at
once and with little time to deliberate
they found themselves placed in front a
resolute enemy their chiefs immediately
assembled around the queen and held a
hasty council war mary's quivering lip
confessed the fear which she endeavoured
to conceal under a bold and dignified demeanour
but her efforts were overcome
by painful recollections the disastrous
issue her last appearance in arras at 
 and when she meant to have
asked them their advice for ordering the
battle she involuntarily enquired whether
there were no means escaping without
an engagement
 escaping answered the lord seyton
 when i stand as one to ten your highness's
enemies i may think escape but
never while i stand with three to two
 the abbot
battle battle exclaimed the assembled
lords we will drive the rebels from
their vantage ground as the hound turns
the hare on the hill side
 methinks my noble lords said the
abbot it were as well to prevent his
gaining that advantage our road lies
through yonder hamlet on the brow and
whichever party hath the luck to possess
it with its little gardens and enclosures
will attain a post great defence
the reverend father is right said the
queen o haste thee seyton haste and
get thither before them they are marching
like the wind
seyton bowed low and turned his horse's
head your highness honours me he
said i will instantly press forward and
seize the pass
 not before me my lord whose charge
is the command the van guard said
the lord arbroath
before you or any hamilton in scotthe
abbot 
land said the ssy ton having the q been's
command follow me gentlemen my vassals
and kinsmen saint bennet and seton
i
and follow me said arbroath my
noble kinsmen and brave mentenants we
will see which will first reach the post 
danger for god and queen mary 
illomened haste and most unhappy
strife said the abbot who saw them and
their followers rush hastily and emulously
to ascend the height without waiting till
their men were placed in order and
you gentlemen he continued addressing
roland and seyton who were each
about to follow those who hastened thus disorderly
to the conflict will you leave the
queen's person unguarded 
o leave me not gentlemen said the
queen roland and seyton do not leave
me there are enough arms to strike in
this fell combat withdraw not those to
whom i trust for my safety
s the abbot
we may not leave her grace said roland
looking at seyton and turning his
horse
 i ever looked when thou wouldst find
out that rejoined the fiery youth
roland made no answer but bit his lip
till the blood came and spurring his horse
up to the side catherine sey ton's palfrey
he whispered in a low voice i never
thought to have done aught to deserve you 
but this day i have heard myself upbraided
with cowardice and my sword remained
still sheathed and all for the love you
there is madness among us all said
the damsel my father my brother and
you are all alike bereft reason ye should
think only this poor queen and you are
all inspired by your own absurd jealousies
the monk is the only soldier and man
 sense amongst you all my lord abbot
she cried aloud were it not better
we should draw to the westward and wait
the event that god shall send us instead
 remaining here in the highway endan
the abbot 
gearing the queen's person and cumbering
the troops in their advance 
you say well my daughter replied the
abbot had we but one to guide us where
the queen's person may be in safety our
nobles hurry to the conflict without casting
a thought on the very cause the
war
follow me said a knight or manatarms
well mounted and attired completely
in black armour but having the visor 
his helmet closed and bearing no crest on
his helmet or device upon his shield
 we will follow no stranger said the
abbot without some warrant his
truth
 i am a stranger and in your hands
said the horseman if you wish to know
more me the queen herself will be your
warrant
the queen had remained fixed to the
spot as if disabled by fear yet mechanically
smiang bowing and waving her hand
 the abba
as banners were lowered and spears depressed
before her while emulating the strife
betwixt seyton and arbroath band on band
pressed forward their march towards the
enemy scarce however had the black
rider whispered something in her ear than
she assented to what he said and when
he spoke aloud and with an air command
 gentlemen it is the queen's pleasure
that you should follow me mary uttered
with something like eagerness the
word yes
all were in motion in an instant for the
black horseman throwing off a sort apathy
 manner which his first appearance indicated
spurred his horse to and fro making
him take such active bounds and short turns
as shewed the rider master the animal 
and getting thequeen's little retinue some
order for marching he led them to the left
directing his course towards a castle which
crowning a gentle yet commanding eminence
presented an extensive view over
the abbot 
the country beneath and in particular
commanded a view those heights which
both armies hastened to occupy and which
it was now apparent must almost instantly
be the scene struggle and dispute
yonder towers said the abbot questioning
the sable horseman to whom do
they belong and are they now in the
hands friends
they are untenanted replied the
stranger or at least they have no hostile
inmates but urge these youths sir abbot
to make more haste this is but an
evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity by
peering out upon the battle in which they
are to take no share
 the worse luck mine said henry
seyton who overheard him i would rather
be under my father's banner at this
moment than be made chamberlain 
for this my present duty peaceful
ward well and patiently discharged
your place under your father's banner
o 
 the abbot
will shortly be right dangerous said roland
avenel who pressing his horse towards
the westward had still his look reverted
to the armies for i see yonder
body cavalry which presses from the
eastward will reach the village ere lord
seyton can gain it
they are but cavalry said seyton
looking attentively they cannot hold the
village without shot marquess
look more closely said roland you
will see that each these horsemen who
advance so rapidly from glasgow carries a
a footman behind him
now by heaven he speaks well said
the black cavalier one you two must
go carry the news to lord seyton and lord
arbroath that they hasten not their horsemen
on before the foot but advance more
regularly
be that my errand said roland for
i first marked the stratagem the enemy
but by your leave said seyton
the abbot 
yonder is my father's banner engaged
and it best becomes me to go to the rescue
i will stand by the queen's decision
said roland avenel
what new appeal what new quarrel 
said queen mary are there not in yonder
dark host enemies enough to mary
stuart but must her very friends turn enemies
to each other 
nay madam said roland the young
master seyton and i did but dispute
who should leave your person to do a most
needful message to the host he thought
his rank entitled him and i deemed that
the person least consequence being myself
were better perilled
not so said the queen if one
must leave me be it seyton
henry seyton bowed till the white plumes
on his helmet mixed with the flowing mane
 his gallant warhorse then placed himself
firm in the saddle shook his lance aloft
with an air triumph and determination
and striking his horse with the spurs made
s the abbot
towards his father's banner which was still
advancing up the hill and dashed his steed
over every obstacle that occurred in his
headlong path
my brother my father exclaimed
catherine with an expression agonized
apprehension they are in the midst 
peril and i in safety 
would to god said roland that i
were with them and could ransom every
drop their blood by two mine i
do i not know thou dost wish it
said catherine can a woman say to a
man what i have well nigh said to thee
and yet think that he could harbour fear
or faintness heart there is that in
yon distant sound approaching battle
that pleases me even while it affright me
i would i were a man that i might feel
that stern delight without the mixture 
terror i
ride up ride up lady catherine seyton
cried the abbot as they still swept
on at a rapid pace and were now close bethe
abbot 
neath the walls the castle ride up
and aid lady fleming to support the queen
she gives way more and more
they halted and lifted mary from the
saddle and were about to support her towards
the castle when she said faintly
 not there not there these walls will i
never enter more 
be a queen madam said the abbot
and forget that you are a woman
o i must forget much much more answered
the unfortunate mary in an undertone
 ere i can look with steady eyes on
these wellknown scenes i must forget the
days which i spent here as the bride the
lost the murthered 
 thesis the castle crookstone said
the lady fleming in which the queen
held her first court after she was married
to darnley
heaven said the abbot thy hand
is upon us bear yet up madam your
foes are the foes holy church and god
 the abbot
will this day decide whether scotland shall
be catholic or heretic
a heavy and continued fire cannon
and musketry bore a tremendous burthen
to his words and seemed far more than
they to recal the spirits the queen 
to yonder tree she said pointing to
a yew tree which grew on a small mount
close to the castle i know it well 
from thence you may see a prospect wide
as from the peaks schehallion
and freeing herself from her assistants
she walked with a determined yet somewhat
wild step up to the stem the noble
yew the abbot catherine and roland
avenel followed her while lady fleming
kept back the inferior persons her train
the black horseman also followed the
queen waiting on her as closely as the
shadow upon the light but ever remaining
at the distance two or three yards he
folded his arms on his bosom turned his
back to the battle and seemed solely occur
abbot 
pied by gazing on mary through the bars
 his closed vizor the queen regarded
him not but fixed her eyes upon the spreading
yew
 ay fair and stately tree she said as
if at the sight it she had been rapt away
from the present scene and had overcome
the horror which had oppressed her at the
first approach to crookstone there thou
stances gay and goodly as ever though
thou hearest the sounds war instead 
the vows love all is gone since i last
greeted thee love and lover vows and
vower king and kingdom how goes the
field my lord abbot with us i trustyet
what but evil can mary's eyes witness
from this spot i
her attendants eagerly bent their eyes
on the field battle but could discover
nothing more than that it was obstinately
debated the small inclosures and cottage
gardens in the village vhich they had a
full and commanding view and which lately
lay with their lines sycamore and ashsis
the abbot
trees so still and quiet in the mild light 
a may sun were now each converted into
a line fire canopied by smoke and the
sustained and constant report the musketry
and cannon mingled with the shouts
 the meeting combatants shewed that as
yet neither party had given ground
 many a soul finds its final departure to
heaven or hell in these awful thunders
said the abbot let those that believe in
the holy church join me in orisons for
victory in this dreadful combat
 not here not here said the unfortunate
queen pray not here father or
pray in silence my mind is too much torn
between the past and the present to dare
to approach the heavenly throne or if ye
will pray be it for one whose fondest affections
have been her greatest crimes and
who has ceased to be a queen only because
she was a deceived and a tenderhearted
woman
were it not well said roland that
the abbot 
i rode somewhat nearer the hosts and saw
the fate the day 
 do so in the name god said the
abbot for if our friends are scattered
our flight must be hasty but beware thou
approach not too nigh the conflict there is
more than thine own life depends on thy
safe return
 o go not too nigh said catherine j
but fail not to see how the seytons fight
and how they bear themselves
 fear nothing i will be on my guard
said ronald avenel and without waiting
further answer rode towards the scene 
conflict keeping as he rode the higher
and uninclosed ground and ever looking
cautiously around him for fear involving
himself in some hostile party as he approached
the shots rung sharp and more
sharply on his ear the shouts came wilder
and wilder and he felt that thick beating
 the heart that mixture natural apprehension
intense curiosity and anxiety for
the dubious event which even the bravest
 the abbot
experience when they approach alone to a
scene interest and danger
at length he drew so close that from a
bank screened by bushes and underwood he
could distinctly see where the struggle was
most keenly maintained this was in a hollow
way leading to the village up which the
queen's vanguard had marched with more
hasty courage than well advised conduct
for the purpose possessing themselves 
that post vantage but they found the
hedges and inclosures already occupied by
the enemy led by the celebrated kirkcaldy
 grange and the earl morton and
not small was the loss which they sustained
while struggling forward to come to close
with the menatarms on the other side
but as the queen's followers were chiefly
noblemen and barons with their kinsmen
and followers they had pressed onwards
contemning obstacles and danger and had
when roland arrived on the ground met
hand to hand at the gorge the pass with
the regent's vanguard and endeavoured to
the abbot 
bear them out the village at the spearpoint
 while their foes equally determined
to keep the advantage which they had attained
struggled with the like obstinacy to
drive back the assailants
both parties were on foot and armed in
proof so that when the long lances the
front ranks were fixed in each other's shields
corslet and breastplates the struggle resembled
that two bulls who fixing their
frontlets hard against each other remain in
that posture for hours until the superior
strength or obstinacy the one compels
the other to take to flight or bears him
down to the earth thus locked together
in the deadly struggle which swayed slowly
to and fro as one or other party gained
the advantage those who fell were trampled
on alike by friends and foes those whose
weapons were broken retired from the front
rank and had their place supplied by others 
while the rearward ranks unable otherwise
to take share in the combat fired their 
the abbot
told and hurled their daggers and the
points and truncheons the broken weapons
like javelins against the enemy
 god and the queen resounded from
the one party god and the king thundered
from the other while in the name 
their sovereign fellowsubjects shed each
other's blood and in the name their
creator defaced his image amid the tumult
was often heard the voices the captains
shouting their commands leaders
and chiefs crying their gathering words j
 groans and shrieks from the falling and
the dying
the strife had lasted nearly an hour the
strength both parties seemed exhausted
but their rage was unabated and their obstinacy
unsubdued when roland who
turned eye and ear to all around him saw
a column infantry headed by a few horsemen
wheel round the base the bank
where he had stationed himself and levelling
their long lances attack the flank 
the abbot 
the queen's vanguard closely engaged as
they were with the conflict on their front
the very first glance shewed him that the
leader who directed this movement was
the knight avenel his ancient master
and the next convinced him that its effect
would be decisive the result the attack
 fresh and unbroken forces upon the
flank those already wearied with a long
and obstinate struggle was indeed instantaneous

the column the assailants which had
hitherto shewn one dark dense and united
line helmets surmounted with plumage
was at once broken and hurled in confusion
down the hill which they had so long endeavoured
to gain in vain were the leaders
heard calling upon their followers to stand
to the combat and seen personally resisting
when all resistance was evidently vain
they were slain or felled to the earth or
hurried backwards by the mingled tide 
flight and pursuit what were roland's
feelings on beholding the rout and feeling
 the abbot
that all that remained for him was to turn
bridle and endeavour to ensure the safety
 the queen's person yet keen as his
grief and shame might be they were both
forgotten when almost close beneath the
bank which he occupied he saw henry
seyton forced away from his own party in
the tumult covered with dust and blood
and defending himself desperately against
several the enemy who had gathered
around him attracted by his gay armour
roland paused not a moment but pushing
his steed down the bank leaped him amongst
the hostile party dealt three or four blows
amongst them which struck down two and
made the rest stand aloof then reaching
seyton his hand he exhorted him to seize
fast on his horse's mane
we live or die together this day said
he keep but fast hold till we are out 
the press and then my horse is yours
seyton heard and exerted his remaining
strength and by their joint efforts roland
brought him out danger and behind the
the abbot 
spot from whence he had witnessed the disastrous
conclusion the fight but no
sooner were they under shelter the trees
than seyton let go his hold and in spite 
roland's efforts to support him fell at length
on the turf trouble yourself no more
with me he said this is my first and my
last battle and i have already seen too
much it to wish to see the close hasten
to save the queen and commend me to
catherine she will never more be mistaken
for me nor i for her the last swordstroke
has made an eternal distinction
 let me aid you to mount my horse
said roland eagerly and you may yet
be saved i can find my own way on foot 
turn but my horse's head westward and he
will carry you fleet and easy as the wind
i will never mount steed more said
the youth farewell i love thee better
dying than ever thought to have done
while in life i would that old man's blood
were not on my hand sancti benedicite
 the abbot
ora pro me stand not to look on a dying
man but haste to save the queen
these words were spoken with the last
effort his voice and scarce were they
uttered ere the speaker was no more they
recalled roland to the sense the duty
which he had wellnigh forgotten but they
did not reach his ears only
the queen where is the queen 
said halbert glendinning who followed
by two or three horsemen appeared at this
instant roland made no answer but turning
his horse and confiding in his speed
gave him at once rein and spur and rode
over height and hollow towards the castle
 crookstone more heavily armed and
mounted upon a horse less speed sir
halbert glendinning followed with couched
lance calling out as he rode sir with
the hollybranch halt and shew your right
to bear that badge fly not thus cowardly
nor dishonour the cognizance thou deserves
not to wear halt sir coward or by heath
abbot 
even i will strike thee with my lance on the
back and slay thee like a dastard i am
the knight avenel i am halbert glendining

but roland who had no purpose encountering
his old master and who besides
knew the queen's safety depended on his
making the best speed he could answered
not a word to the defiances and reproaches
which sir halbert continued to throw out
against him but making the best use his
spurs rode yet harder than before and had
gained about a hundred yards upon his
pursuer when coming near to the yew tree
where he had left the queen he saw them
already getting to horse and cried out as
loud as he could foes foes ride for
if fair ladies brave gentlemen do your
devoir to protect them
so saying he wheeled his horse and
avoiding th shock sir halbert blending
charged one his folio wers who was
nearly on a line with him so rudely with
vol iii p
 the abbot
his lance that he overthrew horse and man
he then drew his sword and attacked the
second while the black manatarms throwing
himself in the way glendinning they
rushed on each other so fiercely that both
horses were overthrown and the riders lay
rolling on the plain neither was able to
arise for the black horseman was pierced
through with glendinning's lance and the
knight avenel oppressed with the
weight his own horse and sorely bruised
besides seemed in little better plight than
he whom he had mortally wounded
yield thee sir knight avenel rescue
or no rescue said roland who had
put a second antagonist out condition to
combat and hastened to prevent blending
from renewing the conflict
 may not chuse but yield said sir
halbert since i can no longer fight but
it shames me to speak such a word to a
coward like thee
call me not coward said roland
lifting his visor and helping his prisoner to
the abbot 
rise since but for old kindness at thy
hand and yet more at thy lady's i had
met thee as a brave man should
 the favourite page my wife said
sir halbert astonished ah wretched
boy i have heard thy treason at lochleven

reproach him not my brother said
the abbot he was but an agent in the
hands heaven
 to horse to horse said catherine
seyton mount and be gone or we are all
lost i see our gallant army flying for many
a league to horse my lord abbot to
horse roland my gracious liege to
horse ere this we should have ridden a
mile
 look on these features said mary
pointing to the dying knight who had been
unheeded by some compassionate hand 
 look there and tell me if she who ruins
all who love her ought to fly a foot farther
to save her wretched life
the reader must have long anticipated
 the abbot
the discovery which the queen's feelings
had made before her eyes confirmed it it
was the features the unhappy george
douglas on which death was stamping his
mark
 look look at him well said the
queen thus has it been with all who loved
mary stuart the royalty francis
the wit chaplet the power and gallantry
 the gay gordon the melody rizzio
the portly form and youthful grace darnley
the bold address and courtly manners
 bothwell and now the deepdevoted
passion the noble douglas nought could
save them they looked on the wretched
mary and to have loved her was crime
enough to deserve early death no sooner
had the victim formed a kind thought me
than the poisoned cup the axe and block
the dagger the mine were ready to punish
them for casting away affection on such a
wretch as i am importune me not i will
fly no farther i can die but once and i
will die here
the abbot 
while she spoke her tears fell fast on
the face the dying man who continued
to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness 
passion which death itself could hardly
subdue mourn not for me he said
faintly but care for your own safety i
die a douglas and i die pitied by mary
stuart i
he expired with these words and without
withdrawing his eyes from her face and
the queen whose heart was that soft
and gentle mould which in domestic life
and with a more suitable partner than darnley
might have made her happy remained
weeping by the dead man until recalled to
herself by the abbot who found it necessary
to use a style unusual remonstrance
 we also madam he said we your
grace's devoted followers have friends and
relatives to weep for i leave a brother in
eminent jeopardy the husband the lady
fleming the father and brothers the
lady catherine are all in yonder bloody
field slain it is to be feared or prisoners
 the abbot
we forget the fate our own nearest and
dearest to wait on our queen and she is
too much occupied with her own sorrows
to give one thought to ours
 i deserve not your reproach father
said the queen checking her tears but
i am docile to it where must we go 
what must we do 
 we must fly and that instantly said
the abbot whither is not so easily answered
but we may dispute it upon the
road lift her to her saddle and set forward

they set off accordingly roland lingered
a moment to command the attendants
 the knight avenel to the castle
 crookstone and to say that he demanded
from him no other condition liberty than
his word that he and his followers would
keep secret the direction in which the
queen fled as he turned his rein to depart
the honest countenance adam woodcock
stared upon him with an expression
 surprise which at another time would
the abbot 
have excited his hearty mirth he had
been one the followers who had experienced
the weight roland's arm and they
now knew each other roland having put
up his vizor and the good yeoman having
thrown away his barret cap with the iron
bars in front that he might the more readily
assist his master into this barretcap as
it lay on the ground roland forgot not
to drop a few gold pieces fruits the
queen's liberality and with a signal 
kind recollection and enduring friendship
he departed at full gallop to overtake the
queen the dust raised by her train being
already far down the hill
it is not fairymoney said honest
adam weighing and handling the gold 
and it is master roland himself that is
a certain thing the same open hand and
by our lady shrugging his shoulders
the same ready fist my lady will hear
 this gladly for she mourns for him as if
he were her son and to see how gay he
is but these light lads are as sure to be
 the abbot
uppermost as the froth to be on the top 
the quartpot your man solid parts remains
ever a falconer so saying he went
to aid his comrades who had now come up
in greater numbers to carry his master into
the castle crookstone
the abbot s
chapter xi
my native land good night
byron
many a bitter tear was shed during the
hasty flight queen mary over fallen
hopes future prospects and slaughtered
friends the deaths the brave douglas
and the fiery but gallant young seyton
seemed to affect the queen as much as the
fall from the throne on which she had so
nearly been again seated catherine seyton
devoured in secret her own grief anxious
to support the broken spirits her
mistress and the abbot bending his anxious
thoughts upon futurity endeavoured in
vain to form some plan which had a shadow
 hope the spirit young roland for
p
 the abbot
he also mingled in the hasty debates held
by the companions the queen's flight
continued unchecked and unbroken
your majesty he said has lost a battle
 your ancestor bruce lost seven successively
ere he sat triumphant on the
scottish throne and proclaimed with the
voice a victor in the field bannockburn
the independence his country are
not these heaths which we may traverse at
will better than the locked guarded and
lake moaned castle lochleven we are
free in that one word there is comfort for
all our losses
he struck a bold note but the heart 
mary made no response
 better she said i had still been in
lochleven than seen the slaughter made
by my rebels among the subjects who offered
themselves to death for my sake speak
not to me further efforts they would
only cost the lives you the friends who
recommend them i would not again unthe
abbot 
tergo what i felt when i saw from yonder
mount the swords the fell horsemen 
morton raging among the faithful seytons
and hamiltons for their loyalty to their
queen i would not again feel what i felt
when douglas's lifeblood stained my mantle
for his love to mary stuart not to be
empress all that britain's seas enclose
find for me some place where i can hide
my unhappy head which brings destruction
on all who love it it is the last favour that
mary asks her faithful followers
in this dejected mood but still pursuing
her flight with unabated rapidity the unfortunate
mary after having been joined
by lord berries and a few followers at
length halted for the first time at the abbey
 dundrennan nearly sixty miles dig
tant from the field battle in this remote
corner galloway the reformation
not having yet been strictly enforced against
the monks a few still lingered in their cells
unmolested j and the prior with tears and
 the abbot
reverence received the fugitive queen at
the gate his convent
i bring you ruin my good father said
the queen as she was lifted from her palfrey

 it is welcome said the prior if it
comes in the train duty
placed on the ground and supported by
her ladies the queen looked for an instant
at her palfrey which jaded and drooping
its head seemed as if it mourned the distresses
 its mistress
 good roland said the queen whispering
let rosabelle be cared for ask thy
heart and it will tell thee why i make this
little request even in this awful hour
she was conducted to her apartment and
in the hurried consultation her attendants
the fatal resolution the retreat to
england was finally adopted in the morning
it received her approbation and a messenger
was dispatched to the english warden
to pray him fox safeconduct and los
the abbot 
vitality on the part the queen scotland
on the next day the abbot walked
in the garden the abbey with roland
to whom he expressed his disapprobation
 the course pursued it is madness and
ruin he said better commit herself to
the savage highlanders or wildbordermen
than to the faith elizabeth a woman to
a rival woman a presumptive successor to
the keeping a jealous queen roland
berries is true and loyal but his counsel
has ruined his mistress
ay ruin follows us every where said
an old man with a spade in his hand and
dressed like a laybrother whose presence
in the vehemence his exclamation
the abbot had not been aware gaze
not on me with such wonder i am he
who was the abbot boniface at kenna
quhair who was the gardener blinkhoolie at
lochleven hunted round to the place in
which i served my noviciate and now yeare
come to rouse me up againa weary
 the abbot
life i have had for one to whom peace was
ever the dearest blessing 
we will soon rid you our company
good father said the abbot and the
queen will i fear me trouble your retreat
no more
nay you said as much before said the
querulous old man rand yet i was put forth
from kinross and pillaged by troopers on
the road they took from me the certificate
that you wot that the baron 
ay he was a mosstrooper like themselves
you asked me it and i could never find
it but they found it it shewed the marriage
 my memory fails me now
see how men differ father nicholas would
have told you an hundred tales the abbot
ingram on whose soul god have mercy
 he was i warrant you fourscore and
six and i am not more than let me see
was not avenel the name you seek
my good father said roland impatiently
yet moderating his tone for fear alarming
or offending the infirm old man
the abbot 
ay right avenel julian avenel 
you are perfect in the name i kept all the
special confessions judging it held with my
vow to do so i could not find it when my
successor ambrosius spoke on't but the
troopers found it and the knight struck
his breast till the target clattered like an
empty wateringcan
saintmary said the abbot ein whom
could such a paper excite such interest 
what was the appearance the knight his
arms his colours 
ye distract me with your questions i
dared hardly look at him they charged me
with bearing letters for the queen and
searched my mail this was all along your
doings at lochleven
 i trust in god said the abbot to roland
who stood beside him shivering and
trembling with impatience the paper has
fallen into the hands my brother i heard
he had been with his followers on the scout
betwixt stirling and glasgow bore not
 the abbot
the knight a holly bough in his helmet 
canst thou not remember 
o remember remember said the
old man pettishly count as many years
as i do if your plots will let you and see
what and how much you remember 
why i scarce remember the pearmains
which i grained here with my own hands
some fifty years since
at this moment a bugle sounded loudly
from the beach
 it is the deathblast to queen mary's
royalty said ambrosius the english
warden's answer has been received favourable
doubtless for when was the door 
the trap closed against the prey which it was
set for droop not roland this matter
shall be sifted to the bottom but we must
not now leave the queen follow me et
us do our duty and trust the issue with god
farewell good father i will visit thee
again soon
he was about to leave the garden fou 
the abbot 
lowed by roland with halfreluctant steps
the ex abbot resumed his spade
i could be sorry for these men he
said ay and for that poor queen but
what avail earthly sorrows to a man fourscore
 and it is a rare dropping morning
for the early colewort
 he is stricken with age said ambrosial
as he dragged roland down to the seabeach
y we must let him take his time to
collectively nothing now can be thought
on but the fate the queen
they soon arrived where she stood surrounded
by her little train and by her side
the sheriff cumberland a gentleman 
the house other richly dressed and
accompanied by soldiers the aspect 
the queen exhibited a singular mixture 
alacrity and reluctance to depart her language
and gestures spoke hope and consolation
to her attendants and she seemed
desirous to persuade even herself that the
step she adopted was secure and that the
assurance she had received kind recept
the abbot
tion was altogether satisfactory but her
quivering lip and unsettled eye betrayed
at once her anguish at departing from scotland
and her fears confiding herself to
the doubtful faith england
welcome my lord abbot said she 
and you roland avenel we have joyful
news for you our loving sister's officer
proffers us in her name a safe asylum from
the rebels who have driven us from our
own only it grieves me we must here part
from you for a short space
 part from us madam said the abbot
j is your welcome in england then
to commence with the abridgment your
train and dismissal your counsellors 
take it not thus good father said
mary the warden and the sheriff faithful
servants our royal sister deem it
necessary to obey her instructions in the
present case even to the letter and can
only admit me with my female attendants
an express will instantly be dispatched
from london assigning me a place rethe
abbot 
silence and i will speedily send to all 
you whenever my court shall be formed
your court formed in england and
while elizabeth lives and reigns said the
abbot that will be when we shall see
two suns in one heaven 
do not think so replied the queen 
 we are well assured our sister's good
faith elizabeth loves fame and not all
that she has won by her power and her wisdom
will equal that which she will acquire
by extending her hospitality to a distressed
sister not all that she may hereafter do
 good wise and great would blot out
the reproach abusing our confidence
farewell my page now my knight farewell
for a brief season i will dry the tears
 catherine or i will weep with her till
neither us can weep longer she held
out her hand to roland who flinging himself
on his knees kissed it with much emotion
he was about to render the same
homage to catherine when the queen assc
the abbot
suing an air sprightliness said her
lips thou foolish boy and catherine coy
it not these english gentlemen should see
that even in our cold clime beauty knows
how to reward bravery and fidelity 
we are not now to learn the force 
scottish beauty or the mettle scottish
valour said the sheriff cumberland
courteously would it were in my power
to bid these attendants upon her who is
herself the mistress scottish beauty as
welcome to england as my poor cares would
make them but our queen's orders are
positive in case such an emergence and
they must not be disputed by her subject
may i remind your majesty that the tide
ebbs fast 
the sheriff took the queen's hand and
she had already placed her foot on the gangway
by which she was to enter the skiff
when the abbot starting from a trance 
grief and astonishment at the words the
sheriff rushed into the water and seized
upon her mantle
the abbot 
she foresaw it she foresaw it he
exclaimed she foresaw your flight into
her realm and foreseeing it gave orders
you should be thus received blinded deceived
doomed princess your fate is sealed
when you quit this strand queen 
scotland thou shalt not leave thine heritage
 he continued holding a still firmer
grasp upon her mantle true men shall
turn rebels to thy will that they may save
thee from captivity or death fear not the
bills and bows whom that gay man has at
his beck we will withstand him by force
o for the arm my warlike brother 
england avenel draw thy sword
the queen stood irresolute and frightened
 one foot upon the plank the other
on the sand her native shore which she
was quitting for ever
 what needs this violence sir priest
said the sheriff cumberland i came
hither at your queen's command to do her
service and i will depart at her least order
if she rejects such aid as i can offer no
 the abbot
marvel is it if our queen's wisdom foresaw
that such chance as this might happen
amidst the turmoils your unsettled state 
and while willing to afford fair hospitality
to her royal sister deemed it wise to prohibit
the entrance a broken army her
followers into the english frontier
you hear said queen mary gently
unloosing her robe from the abbot's grasp
 that we exercise full liberty choice in
leaving this shore and questionless the
choice will remain free to us in going to
france or returning to our own dominions
as we shall determine besides it is
too late your blessing father and godspeed
thee 
may he have mercy on thee and speed
thee also said the abbot retreating
but my soul tells me i look on thee for
the last time 
the sails were hoisted the oars were
plied the vessel went freshly on her way
through the faith which divides the shores
 cumberland from those galloway 
the abbot 
but not till the vessel diminished to the
size a child's frigate did the doubtful
and dejected and dismissed followers the
queen cease to linger on the sands and
long long could they discern the kerchief
 mary as she waved the oftrepeated signal
 adieu to her faithful adherents and
to the shores scotland
if good tidings a private nature could
have consoled roland for parting with his
mistress and for the distresses his sovereign
he received such comfort some days
subsequent to the queen's leaving dunduenna
a breathless post no other than
adam woodcock brought dispatches from
sir halbert glendinning to the abbot
whom he found with roland still residing
at dundrennan and in vain torturing boniface
with fresh interrogations the 
the abbot
et bore an earnest invitation to his brother
to make avenel castle for a time
his residence the clemency the
regent said the writer has extended
pardon both to roland and to you upon
condition your remaining a time under
my wardship and i have that to communicate
respecting the parentage roland
which not only you will willingly listen to
but which will be also found to afford meas
the husband his nearest relative
some interest in the future course his
life
the abbot read this letter and paused
as if considering what were best for him todo
meanwhile woodcock took roland
aside and addressed him as follows 
 now look mr roland that you do not
let any papist nonsense lure either the priest
or you from the right quarry see you
you ever bore yourself as a bit a gentleman
read that and thank god that
threw old abbot boniface in our way as
two the seyton's men were conveying
the abbot 
toward dundrennan here we searched
him for intelligence concerning that fair
exploit your's at lochleven that has
cost many a man his life and me a set 
sore bones and we found what is better
for your purpose than our's
the paper which he gave was indeed
an attestation by father philip subscribing
himself unworthy sacristan and brother 
the house saint mary's stating that
under a vow secrecy he had united in the
holy sacrament marriage julian avenel
and catherine graeme but that julian having
repented his union he father
philip had been sinfully prevailed on by
him to conceal and disguise the same according
to a complot devised betwixt him
and the said julian avenel whereby the
poor damsel was induced to believe that
the ceremony had been performed by one
not in holy orders and having no authority
to that effect which sinful concealment
the undersigned conceived to be the cause
vol iii q
 the abbot
why he was abandoned to the misguiding
 a water fiend whereby he had been under
a spell besides being sorely afflicted
with rheumatic pains ever after wherefore
he had deposited this certificate and
confession with the day and date the
said marriage with his lawful superior boniface
abbot saint mary's sui simili
confessions
it appeared by a letter from julian folded
carefully up with the certificate that the
abbot boniface had in effect bestirred
himself in the affair and obtained from the
baron a promise to avow his marriage but
the death both julian and his injured
bride together with the abbot's resignation
his ignorance the fate their unhappy
offspring and above all his listless and inactive
disposition had suffered the matter
to become totally forgotten until it was
recalled by some accidental conversation
with the abbot ambrosius concerning the
fortunes the avenel family at the rethe
abbot 
quest his successor he searched for it 
but as he would receive no assistance in
looking among the few records spiritual
experiences and important confessions
which he had conscientiously treasured
it might have remained for ever hidden
amongst them but for the more active researches
 sir halbert glendinning
so that you are like to be heir 
at last master roland after my lord
and lady have gone to their place said
adam and as i have but one boon to
ask i trust you will not nick me with
nay
not if it be in my power to say yes
my trusty friend
why then i must needs if i live to see
that day keep on feeding the classes with
unwashed flesh said woodcock sturdily
yet as if doubting the reception that his
request might meet with
 thou shalt feed them with what you
list for me said roland laughing i am
not many months older than when i left
s the abbot
the castle but i trust i have gathered wit
enough to cross no man skill in his own
vocation
 then i would not change places with
the king's falconer said adam woodcock
nor with the queen's neither but they
say she will be mewed up and never need
one i see it grieves you to think it and
i could grieve for company but what help
for it fortune will fly her own flight let a
man hollo himself hoarse
the abbot and roland journeyed to
avenel where the former was tenderly received
by his brother while the lady wept
for joy to find that in her favourite orphan
she had protected the sole surviving branch
 her own family sir halbert blending
and his household were not a little
surprised at the change which a brief acquaintance
with the world had produced in
their former inmate and rejoiced to find
in the petted spoiled and presuming page
a modest and unassuming young mean too
much acquainted with his own expectations
the abbot 
and character to be hot or petulant in demanding
the consideration which was readily
and voluntarily yielded to him the
old major domo innate was the first to
sing his praises to which mrs lilies bore a
loud echo always hoping that god would
teach him the true gospel
to the true gospel the heart roland
had secretly long inclined and the departure
 the good abbot for france with
the purpose entering into some house 
his order in that kingdom removed his
chief objection to renouncing the catholic
faith another might have existed in the
duty which he owed to magdalen graeme
both by birth and from gratitude but he
learned ere he had been long a resident in
avenel that his grandmother had died at
cologne in the performance a penance
too severe for her age which she had taken
upon herself in behalf the queen and
church scotland so soon as she heard
 the defeat at languid the zeal the
s the abbot
abbot ambrosius was more regulated but
he retired into the scottish convent 
and so lived there that the fraternity
were inclined to claim for him the
honours canonization but he guessed
their purpose and prayed them on his
deathbed to do no honours to the body 
one as sinful as themselves but to send his
body and his heart to be buried in avenel
burialaisle in the monastery saint mary's
that the last abbot that celebrated
house devotion might sleep among its
 ruins
long before that period arrived roland
avenel was wedded to catherine seyton
who after two years residence with her unhappy
mistress was dismissed upon her being
subjected to closer restraint than had
been at first exercised she returned to
her father's house and as roland was acknowledged
for the successor and lawful
heir the ancient house avenel greatly
increased as the estate was by the providence
 sir halbert glendinning there
the abbot 
occurred no objections to the match on the
part her family her mother was recently
dead when she first entered the convent
 and her father in the unsettled times
which followed queen mary's flight to
england was not averse to an alliance with
a youth who himself loyal to queen mary
still held some influence through means 
sir halbert glendinning vith the party in
power
roland and catherine therefore were
united spite their differing faiths and
the white lady whose apparition had been
infrequent when the house avenel seemed
verging to extinction was seen to sport
by her haunted well with a zone gold
around her bosom as broad as the baldric
ofan earl

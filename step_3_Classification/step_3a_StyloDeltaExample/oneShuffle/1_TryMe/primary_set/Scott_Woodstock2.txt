 you also expected to visit there
yourself and so keep watch over pretty mistress
lee eh 
i never entertained so selfish a thought
said everard and if this nocturnal disturbance
at the mansion were explained and ended
i would instantly take my departure
 your friend noll would expect something
more from you said avildrake he would
expect in case the knight's reputation for loyalty
should draw any our poor exiles and wanderers
about the lodge that you should be on
the watch and ready to snap them in a word
as far as i can understand his longwinded
speechesshe would have woodstock a trap
your uncle and his pretty daughter the bait 
toasted cheesescraving your chloe's pardon for
the comparison you the springfall which should
bar their escape his lordship himself being the
great grimalkin to whom they arc to be given
over to be devoured
dared cromwell mention this to thee in express
terms said everard pulling up historic
and stopping in the midst the road
 woodstock
nay not in express terms which i do not
believe he ever used in his life you might as
well expect a drunken man to go straight forward
but he insinuated as much to me and
indicated that you might deserve well him 
gatzo the damnable proposal sticks in my
throat by betraying our noble and rightful
king here he pulled oflp his hat whom god
grant in health and wealth long to reign as the
worthy clergyman says though i fear just now
his majesty is both sick and sorry and never a
penny in his pouch to boot
this tallies with what alice hinted said
everard but how could she know it didst
thou give her any hint such a thing 
i replied the cavalier i who never saw
mistress alice in my life till tonight and then
only for an instant zooks man how is that possible

true replied everard and seemed lost in
thought at length he spoke i should call
cromwell to account for his bad opinion me 
for even though not seriously expressed but as
i am convinced it was with the sole view prowoodstock

wing you and perhaps myself it was nevertheless
a misconstruction to be resented
i'll carry a cartel for you with all my heart
and soul said wildrake and turn out with
his godliness second with as good will as i ever
drank a glass sack
pshaw replied everard those in his high
place fight no singular combats but tell me
roger wildrake didst thou thyself think me capable
 the falsehood and treachery implied in
such a message 
i exclaimed wildrake markham everard
you have been my early friend my constant
benefactor when colchester was reduced you
saved me from the gallows and since that thou
hast twenty times saved me from starving but
by heaven if i thought you capable such villainy
as your general recommended by yonder
blue sky and all the works creation which it
bends over i would stab you with my own
hand 
death replied everard i should indeed
deserve but not from you perhaps but fortunately
i cannot if i would be guilty the
 woodstock
treachery you would punish know that i had
this day secret notice and from cromwell himself
that the young man has escaped by sea from
bristol
now god almighty be blessed who protected
him through so many dangers exclaimed
wildrake huzza up hearts cavaliers 
hey for cavaliers god bless king charles 
moon and stars catch my hat and he threw
it up as high as he could into the air the celestial
bodies which he invoked did not receive
the present dispatched to them but as in the
case sir henry lee's scabbard an old gnarled
oak became a second time the receptacle a
waif and stray loyal enthusiasm wildrake
looked rather foolish at the circumstance and
his friend took the opportunity admonishing
him
art thou not ashamed to bear thee so like a
schoolboy 
why said wildrake i have but sent a
puritan's hat upon a loyal errand i laugh to
think how many the schoolboys thou talk'st 
will be cheated into climbing the pollard next
woodstock si
year expecting to find the nest some unknown
bird in yonder unmeasured margin felt
hush now for god's sake and let us speak
calmly said everard charles has escaped
and i am glad it i would willingly have seen
him on his father's throne by composition but
not by the force the scottish army and the
incensed and vengeful royalists 
master markham everard began the cavalier
interrupting him
nay hush dear wildrake said everard 
let us not dispute a point on which we cannot
agree and give me leave to go on i say since
the young man has escaped cromwell offensive
and injurious stipulation falls to the ground and
i see not why my uncle and his family should
not again enter their own house under the same
terms connivance as many other royalists
what may be incumbent on me is different nor
can i determine my course until i have an interview
with the general which as i think will
 in his confessing that he threw in this offensive
proposal to sound us both it is much in his
u
it
 woodstock
manner for he is blunt and never sees or feels
the punctilious honour which the gallants the
day stretch to such delicacy
 acquit him for having any punctilio
about him said wildrake either touching
honour or honesty now to come back to where
we started supposing you were not to reside in
person at the lodge and to forbear even visiting
there unless on invitation when such a thing
can be brought about i tell you frankly i think
your uncle and his daughter might be induced
to come back to the lodge and reside there as
usual at least the clergyman that worthy old
cock gave me to hope as much
he had been hasty in bestowing his confine
hence said everard
true replied wildrake he confided in
in me at once for he instantly saw my regard
for the church i thank heaven i never passed
a clergyman in his canonicals without pulling my
hat off and thou knowest the most desperate
duel lever fought was with young gray less the
inner temple for taking the wall the reverend
dr dunce ah i can gain a chaplain's ear inwoodstock

scanty gadzooks they know whom they have
to trust to in such a one as i
dost thou think then said colonel everard
 or rather does this clergyman think that
if they were secure intrusion from me the family
would return to the lodge supposing the
intruding commissioners gone and this nocturnal
disturbance explained and ended 
the old knight answered wildrake maybe
wrought upon by the doctor to return if he
is secure against intrusion as for disturbances
the stout old boy so far as i can learn in two
minutes conversation laughs at all this turmoil
as the work mere imagination the consequence
 the remorse their own evil consciences 
and says that goblin or devil was never heard 
at woodstock until it became the residence 
such men as they who have now usurped the possessions

there is more than imagination in it said
everard i have personal reason to know there
is some conspiracy carrying on to render the
house untenantable by the commissioners i acquit
my uncle accession to such a silly trick 
vol c
 woodstock
but i must see it ended ere i can agree to his
and my cousin's residing where such a confederacy
exists for they are likely to be considered
as the contrivers such pranks be the actual
agent who he may
with reverence to your better acquaintance
with the gentleman everard i should rather
suspect the old father puritans i beg your
pardon again has something to do with the business
 and if so lucifer will never look near
the true old knight's beard nor abide a glance
 yonder maiden's innocent blue eyes i will
uphold them as safe as pure gold in a miser's
chest
safest thou aught thyself which makes thee
think thus 
not a quill the devil's pinion saw i replied
wildrake he supposes himself too secure
 an old cavalier who must steal hang or drown
in the long run so he gives himself no trouble to
look after the assured booty but i heard the
servingfellows prate what they had seen and
heard and though their tales were confused
enough yet if there was any truth among them
woodstock
at all i should say the devil must have been in
the dance but hollo here comes some one
upon us stand friend who art thou 
a poor daylabourer in the great work 
england joseph tomkins by name secretary
to a godly and wellendowed leader in this poor
christian army england called general harrison

 what news master tomkins said everard
 and why are you on the road at this late
hours
i speak to the worthy colonel everard as
i judge said tomkins and truly i am glad
 meeting your honour heaven knows i need
such assistance as yours oh worthy master
everard here has been a sounding trumpets
and a breaking vials and a pouring
forth and 
prithee tell me in brief what is the matter
where is thy master and in a word what has
happened 
my master is close by parading it in the
little meadow beside the hugeous oak which is
called by the name the late man ride but two
steps forward and you may see him walking
wooijstocif
swiftly to and fro advancing all the while the
naked weapon
upon proceeding as directed but with as little
noise as possible they descried a man whom
 course they concluded must be harrison
walking to and fro beneath the king's oak as a
sentinel under arms but with more wildness 
demeanour the tramp the horses did not
escape his ear and they heard him call out as
if at the head the brigade lower pikes
against cavalry here comes prince rupertstand
fast and you shall turn them aside as a
bull would toss a curdog lower your pikes
still my hearts the secured against your foot
down on your right knee front rank spare
not for the spoiling your blue aprons ha 
zerobabel ay that is the word
in the name heaven about whom or
what is he talking said everard wherefore
does he go about with his weapon drawn 
truly sir when aught disturbs my master
general harrison he is something rapt in the
spirit and conceives that he is commanding a reserve
 pikes at the great battle armageddon
and for his weapon alack worthy sir wherefore
woodstock s
should he keep sheffield steel in calves leather
when there are fiends to be combated incarnate
fiends on earth and raging infernal fiends under
the earth 
 this is intolerable said everard listen
to me tomkins thou art not now in the
pulpit and i desire none thy preaching language
i know thou canst speak intelligibly
when thou art so minded remember i may
serve or harm thee and as you hope or fear anything
on my part answer straightforward 
what has happened to drive out thy master to
the wild wood at this time night
 forsooth worthy and honoured sir i will
speak with the precision i may true it is and
 verity that the breath man which is in his
nostrils goeth forth and returned 
hark you sir said colonel everard take
care where you ramble in your correspondence
with me you have heard how at the great battle
 dunbar in scotland the general himself
held a pistol to the head lieutenant hewcreed
threatening to shoot him through the brain
if he did not give up holding forth and put his
squadron in line to the front take care sir
 v i vj o
 woodstock
verily the lieutenant then charged with an
even and unbroken order said tomkins and
bore a thousand plaids and bonnets over the
beach before him into the sea neither shall i
pretermit or postpone your honour's commands
but speedily obey them and that without delay
 go to fellow thou knowest what i would
have said everard speak at once i know
thou canst if thou wilt trusty tomkins is better
known than he thinks for
worthy sir said tomkins in a much less
periphrastic style i will obey your worship as
far as the spirit will permit truly it was not an
hour since when my worshipful master being at
table with master bibbet and myself not to
mention the worshipful master bletson and colonel
desborough and behold there was a violent
knocking at the gate as one in haste now 
a certainty so much had our household been
harassed with witches and spirits and other objects
 sound and sight that the sentinels could
not be brought to abide upon their posts without
doors and it was only by provision beef and
strong liquors that we were able to maintain
a guard three men in the hall who neverthe
woodstock 
less ventured not to open the door lest they
should be surprised with some the goblins
wherewith their imaginations were overwhelmed
and they heard the knocking which increased
until it seemed that the door was well nigh about
to be beaten down worthy master bibbet was a
little overcome with liquor as is his fashion goodman
about this time the evening not that he
is in the least given to ebriety but simply that
since the scottish campaign he hath had a perpetual
ague which obliges him so to nourish his
frame against the damps the night wherefore
as it is well known to your honour that i
discharge the office a faithful servant as well
to majorgeneral harrison and the other commissioners
as to my just and lawful master colonel
desborough 
i know all that and now that thou art
trusted by both i pray to heaven thou may'st
merit the trust said colonel everard
and devoutly do i pray said tomkins
that your worshipful prayers may be answered
with favour for certainly to be and to be called
and entitled honest joe and trusty tomkins
is to me more than ever would be an ears title
 woodstockwere
such things to be granted anew in this regenerated
government
well go on go on or if thou tallest much
longer i will make bold to dispute the article 
your honesty i like short tales sir and doubt
what is told with a long unnecessary train 
words
well good sir be not hasty as i said before
thedoors rattled till you would have thought
the knocking was reiterated in every room 
the palace the bell rung out for company
though we could not find that any one tolled the
clapper and the guards let off their firelock merely
because they knew not what better to do so
master bibbet being as i said unsusceptible 
his duty i went down with my poor rapier to the
door and demanded who was there and i was
answered in a voice which i must say was
much like another voice that it was one wanting
majorgeneral harrison so as it was then late
i answered mildly that general harrison was
betaking himself to his rest and that any who
wished to speak to him must return on the morrow
morning for that after nightfall the door 
the palace being in the room a garrison would
woodstock 
be opened to no one so the voice replied and
bid me open directly without which he would
blow the folding leaves the door into the middle
 the hall and therewithal the noise recommenced
that we thought the house would
have fallen and i was in some measure constrained
to open the door even like a besieged garrison
which can hold out no longer
by my honour and it was stoutly done you
i must say said wildrake who had been listening
with much interest i am a bold daredevil
enough yet when i had two inches oak plank
between the actual fiend and me hang him that
would demolish the barrier between us say i
i would as soon when aboard bore a hole in the
ship and let in the waves for you know we always
compare the devil to the deep seas
pr'ythee peace wildrake said everard
and let him on with his history well and
what saw'st thou when the door was opened 
the great devil with his horns and claws thou
wilt say no doubt
 no sir i will say nothing but what is true 
when i undid the door one man stood there
and he to seeming a man no extraordinary
 woodstock
appearance he was wrapped in a taffeta cloak
 a scarlet colour and with a red lining he
seemed as if he might have been in his time a
very handsome man but there was something 
paleness and sorrow in his face a long lovelock
and long hair he wore even after the abomination
 the cavaliers and the unloveliness as
learned master prynne well termed it lovelocks
 a jewel in his ear a blue scarf over his
shoulder like a military commander for the king
and a hat with a white plume bearing a peculiar
hatband
some unhappy officer cavaliers whom
so many are in hiding and seeking shelter through
the country briefly replied everard
true worthy sir right as a judicious exposition
but there was something about this
man if he was a man whom i for one could
not look upon without trembling nor the musketeers
who were in the hall without betraying
much alarm and swallowing as they themselves
swill aver the very bullets which they had in
their mouths for loading their carabines and muskets
nay the wolf and deerdogs that are
woodstock 
the fiercest their kind fled from this visitor
and crept into holes and corners moaning and
wailing in a low and broken tone he came
into the middle the hall and still he seemed
no more than an ordinary man only somewhat
fantastically dressed in a doublet black velvet
pinked upon scarlet satin under his cloak a jewel
in his ear with large roses in his shoes and a
kerchief in his hand which he sometimes pressed
against his left side
gracious heaven said wildrake coming
close up to everard and whispering in his ear
with accents which terror rendered tremulous a
mood mind most unusual to the daring man
who seemed now overcome by it it must have
been poor dick robinson the player in the very
dress in which i have seen him play pilaster 
ay and drank a jolly bottle with him after it at
the mermaid i remember how many frolicks
we had together and all his little fantastic fashions
he served for his old master charles
in mohun's troop and was murdered by this
butcher's dog as i have heard after surrender
at the battle nasebyfield
 woodstock
hush i have heard the deed said everard
 for god's sake hear the man to an 
did this visitor speak to thee my friend 
yes sir in a pleasing tone voice but
somewhat fanciful in the articulation and like
one who is speaking to an audience as from a
bar or a pulpit more than in the voice ordinary
men on ordinary matters he desired to
see majorgeneral harrison
he did and you said everard infected
by the spirit the time which as is well known
leaned to credulity upon all matters supernatural
agency what did you do 
i went up to the parlour and related that
such a person inquired for him he started when
i told him and eagerly desired to know the
man's dress but no sooner did i mention his
dress and the jewel in his ear than he said
begone tell him i will not admit him to speech
 me say that i defy him and will make my
defiance good at the great battle in the valley 
armageddon when the voice the angel shall
call all fowls which fly under the face heaven
to feed on the flesh the captain and the soils

woodstock
tier the warhorse and his rider say to the
evil one i have power to appeal our conflict
even till that day and that in the front that
fearful day he will again meet with harrison
i went back with this answer to the stranger
and his face was writhed into such a deadly
frown as a mere human brow hath seldom worn
return to him he said and say it is my
hour and that if he come not instantly down to
speak with me i will mount the stairs to him
say that i command him to descend by the token
that on the field naseby he did not the
work negligently 
 i have heard whispered wildrake who
felt more and more strongly the contagion superstition
 that these words were blasphemously
used by harrison when he shot my poor
friend dick
what happened next said everard see
that thou speaks the truth
as gospel expounded by a steepleman
said the independent yet truly it is but little
i have to say i saw my master come down
with a blank yet resolved air and when he entered
the hall and saw the stranger he made a
 woodstock
pause the other waved on him as if to follow
and walked out at the portal my worthy patron
seemed as if he were about to follow yet
again paused when this visitant be he man or
fiend reentered and said obey thy doom
by pathless march by greenwood tree
it is thy weird to follow me 
to follow me through the ghastly moonlight 
to follow me through the shadows night 
to follow me comrade still art thou bound 
i conjure thee by the untouched wound
i conjure thee by the last words i spoke
when the body slept and the spirit awoke
in the very last pangs the deadly stroke
so saying he stalked out and my master followed
him into the wood i followed also at a
distance but when i came up my master was
alone and bearing himself as you now behold
him
thou hast had a wonderful memory friend
said the colonel coldly to remember these
rhymes in a single recitation there seems something
 practice in all this
a single recitation my honoured sir exclaimed
the independent alack the rhyme is
seldom out my poor master's mouth when as
sometimes laps he is less triumphant in his
woodstock 
wrestles with satan but it was the first time 
ever heard it uttered by another and to say
truth he ever seems to repeat it unwillingly as a
child after his pedagogue and as it was not indited
by his own head as the psalmist saith
it is strange said everard i have heard
and read that the spirits the slaughtered have
strange power over the slayer but i am astonished
to believe there may be truth in such tales
roger wildrake what art thou afraid 
man why dost thou shift thy place thus 
fear it is not fear it is hate deadly hate
i see the murderer poor dick before me
and see he throws himself into a posture fence
sa sa say'st thou brood a butcher's mastiffs
thou shalt not want an antagonist
ere any one could stop him wildrake threw
aside his cloak drew his sword and almost with
a single bound cleared the distance betwixt him
and harrison and crossed swords with the latter
as he stood brandishing his weapon as if in
immediate expectation an assailant accordingly
the republican general was not for an
instant taken at unawares but the moment the
swords clashed he shouted ha i feel thee
 woodstock
now thou hast come in body at last welcome 
welcome the sword the lord and gideon

 part them part them cried everard as he
and tom king at first astonished at the suddenness
 the affray hastened to interfere everard
seizing on the cavalier drew him forcibly backwards
while tomkins contrived with risk and
difficulty to master harrison's sword while the
general exclaimed ha two to one two to
one thus fight demons wildrakeon his side
swore a dreadful oath and added markham
you have cancelled every obligation i owed you 
they are all out sight gone d n me
 you have indeed acquitted these obligations
rarely said everard who knows how this
affair shall be explained and answered 
i will answer it with my ife said wildrake

good now be silent said tomkins and
let me manage it shall be so ordered that the
good general shall never know that he hath encountered
with a mortal man only let that man
 moab put his sword into the scabbard's rest
and be still
woodstock 
wildrake let me entreat thee to sheathe thy
sword said everard else on my life thou
must turn it against me
no fore george not so mad as that neither
but i'll have another day with him
 thou another day exclaimed harrison
whose eye had still remained fixed on the spot
where he found such palpable resistance yes
i know thee well day by day week by week
thou makes the same idle request for thou
knowest that my heart quivers at thy voice 
but my hand trembles not when opposed to thine
the spirit is willing to the combat if the flesh
be weak when opposed to that which is not 
the flesh
now peace all for heaven's sake said
the steward tomkins then added addressing
his master there is no one here if it please
your excellence but tomkins and the worthy
colonel everard
general harrison as sometimes happens in
cases partial insanity that is supposing his
to have been a case mental delusion though
vol d
 woodstock
firmly and entirely persuaded the truth his
own visions yet was not willing to speak on the
subject to those who he knew would regard them
as imaginary upon this occasion he assumed
the appearance perfect ease and composure
after the violent agitation he had just manifested
in a manner which showed how anxious he was to
disguise his real feelings from everard whom he
considered as unlikely to participate them
he saluted the colonel with profound ceremony
and talked the fineness the evening
which had summoned him forth the lodge to
take a turn in the park and enjoy the favourable
weather he then took everard by the arm and
walked back with him towards the lodge wildrake
and tomkins following close behind and
leading the horses everard desirous to gain
some light on these mysterious incidents endeavoured
to come on the subject more than once by
a mode interrogation which harrison for madmen
are very often unwilling to enter on the subject
 their mental delusion parried with some
skill or addressed himself for aid to his steward
tomkins who was in the habit seeing voucher
woodstock 
for his master upon all occasions which led to
desirous's ingenious nickname gibbet
and wherefore had you your sword drawn
my worthy general said everard when you
were only on an evening walk pleasure 
truly excellent colonel these are times
when men must watch with their loins girded
and their lights burning and their weapons
drawn the day draweth nigh believe me or not
as you will that men must watch lest they be
found naked and unarmed when the seven trumpets
shall sound boot and saddle and the pipes
 jeer shall strike up horse and away
 true good general but methought i saw
you making passes even now as if you were fighting
said everard
i am a strange fantasy friend everard
answered harrison and when i walk alone
and happen as but now to have my weapon
drawn i sometimes for exercise sake will practise
a thrust against such a tree as that it is a
silly pride men have in the use weapons i
have been accounted a master fence and have
fought prizes when i was unregenerate and
 woodstock
before i was called to do my part in the great
work entering as a trooper into our victorious
general's first regiment horse
but methought said everard i heard a
weapon clash with yours 
how a weapon clash with my sword 
how could that be tomkins 
truly sir said tomkins it must have
been a bough the tree they have them all
kinds here and your honour may have pushed
against one them which the brazilians call
ironwood a block which being struck with a
hammer saith purchas in his pilgrimage ringeth
like an anvil
 truly it may be so said harrison for
these rulers who are gone assembled in this their
abode pleasure many strange trees and plants
though they gathered not the fruit that
tree which beareth twelve manner fruits or
 those leaves which are the healing the nations

everard pursued his investigation for he was
struck with the manner in which harrison evaded
his questions and the dexterity with which
woodstock 
lie threw his transcendental and fanatical notions
like a sort veil over the darker visions excited
by remorse and conscious guilt
but said he if i may trust my eyes and
ears i cannot but still think that you had a real
antagonist nay i am sure i saw a fellow in a
darkcoloured jerkin retreat through the wood
did you said harrison with a tone 
surprise while his voice faltered in spite him
who could he be tomkins did you see the
fellow colonel everard talks with the napkin
in his hand the bloody napkin which he always
pressed to his side 
this last expression in which harrison gave
a mark different from that which everard had
assigned but corresponding to tomkins's original
description the supposed spectre had more
effect on everard in confirming the steward's
story than anything he had witnessed or heard
the voucher answered the draft upon him as
promptly as usual that he had seen such a fellow
glide past them into the thicket that he daresay
he was some deerstealer for he had heard they
were become very audacious
 woodstock
look ye there now master everard said
harrison hurrying from the subject is it not
time now that we should lay aside our controversies
and join hand in hand to repairing the
breaches our zion happy and contented
were i my excellent friend to be a reader 
mortar or a bearer a hod upon this occasion
under our great leader with whom providence
has gone forth in this great national controversy 
and truly so devoutly do i hold by our excellent
and victorious general oliver whom heaven
long preserve that were he to command me i
should not scruple to pluck forth his high
place the man whom they call speaker even as
i lent a poor hand to pluck down the man whom
they called king wherefore as i know your
judgment holdeth with mine on this matter let
rae urge unto you lovingly that we may act as brethren
and build up the breaches and reestablish
the bulwarks our english zion whereby we
shall be doubtless chosen as pillars and buttresses
under our excellent lord general for supporting
and sustaining the same and endowed with
proper revenues and incomes both spiritual and
moodstotx 
temporal to serve as a pedestal on which we
may stand seeing that otherwise our foundation
will be on the loose sand nevertheless continued
he his mind again diverging from his
views temporal ambition into his visions 
the fifth monarchy these things are but vanity
in respect the opening the which
is sealed for all things approach speedily towards
lightning and thundering and unloosing the
great dragon from the bottomless pit wherein he
is chained
with this mingled strain earthly politics
and fanatical prediction harrison so overpowered
colonel everard as to leave him no time to urge
lira further on the particular circumstances 
his nocturnal skirmish concerning which it is
plain he had no desire to be interrogated they
now reached the lodge woodstock
 woodstock
chapter iii
now the wasted brands do glow
while the screechowl sounding loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance a shroud
now it is the time night
that the graves all gaping wide
livery one lets out its sprite
in the churchway paths to glide
midsummer night's dream
before the gate the palace the guards were
now doubled everard demanded the reason 
this from the corporal whom he found in the hall
with his soldiers sitting or sleeping around a great
fire maintained at the expense the carved
chairs and benches with fragments which it
was furnished
why verily answered the man the corps
de garde as your worship says will be harassed
to pieces by such dujy nevertheless fear hath
woodstock 
gone abroad among us and no one man will
mount guard alone we have drawn in however
one or two our outposts from banbury
and elsewhere and we are to have a relief from
oxford tomorrow
everard continued minute inquiries concerning
the sentinels that were posted within as
well as without the castle and found that as
they had been stationed under the eye harrison
himself the rules prudent discipline had
been exactly observed in the distribution the
posts there remained nothing therefore for colonel
everard to do excepting that remembering
his own adventure the evening to recommend
that an additional sentinel should be placed with
a companion if judged indispensable in that vestibule
or antiroom from which the long gallery
where he had met with the rencounter and other
suites apartments diverged the corporal respectfully
promised all obedience to his orders
the servingmen being called appeared also in
double force everard demanded to know whether
the commissioners had gone to bed or whether
he could get speech with them 
f they are in their bedroom forsooth replied
 woodstock
one the fellows but i think be not yet undressed

what said everard are colonel desborough
and master bletson both in the same
sleeping apartment 
their honours have so chosen it said the
man and their honours secretaries remain
upon guard all night
it is the fashion to double guards all over
the house said wildrake had i a glimpse 
a goodlooking housemaid now i should know
how to fall into the fashion
peace fool said everard and where
are the mayor and master holdenough 
the mayor is returned to the borough on
horseback behind the trooper who goes to oxford
for the reinforcement and the man the
steeplehouse hath quartered himself in the chamber
which colonel desborough had last night
being that in which he is most likely to meet the
your honour understands the lord pity
us we are a harassed family 
and where be general harrison's knaves
said tomkins that they do not marshal him
to his apartment 
woodstock 
here here here master tompkins said
three fellows pressing forward with the same consternation
on their faces which seemed to pervade
the whole inhabitants woodstock
away with you then said tomkins 
speak not to his worship you see he is not in
the humour
indeed observed colonel everard he
looks singularly wan his features seem writhen
as by a palsy stroke and though he was talking
so fast while we came along he hath not opened
this mouth since we came to the light
it is his manner after such visitations said
tomkins give his honour your arms zedekiah
and jonathan to lead him off i will follow
instantly you nicodemus tarry to wait upon
me it is not well walking alone in this mansion
master tomkins said everard i have
heard you often as a sharp intelligent man 
tell me fairly are you in earnest afraid anything
supernatural haunting this house 
i would be loath to run the chance sir said
tomkins very gravely by looking on my worshipful
master you may form a guess how the
living look after llicy have spoken with the dead
 woodstock
he bowed low and took his leave everard
proceeded to the chamber which the two remaining
commissioners had for comfort's sake chosen
to inhabit in company they were preparing
for bed as he went into their apartment both
started as the door opened both rejoiced when
they saw it was only everard who entered
hark ye hither said bletson pulling him
aside safest thou ever ass equal to lesbos
 the fellow is as big as an ox and as
timorous as a sheep he has insisted on my
sleeping here to protect him shall we have a
merry night on't ha we will if thou wilt take
the third bed which was prepared for harrison 
but he is gone out like a mooncalf to look for
the valley armageddon in the park woodstock

general harrison has returned with me but
now said everard
nay but as i shall live he comes not into
our apartment said desborough overhearing
his answer no man that has been supping
for aught i know with the devil has a right to
sleep among christian folks
woodstock t
 he does not propose so said everard 
he sleeps as i understand apart and alone
not quite alone i dare say said lesbos
 for harrison hath a sort attraction
for goblins they fly round him like moths about
a candle but i prithee good everard do thou
stay with us i know not how it is but although
thou hast not thy religion always in thy mouth
nor speaks many hard words about it like harrison
 nor makes long preachments like a certain
most honourable relation mine who shall
be nameless yet somehow i feel myself safer in
thy company than with any them as for
this bletson he is such a mere blasphemer that
i fear the devil will carry him away ere morning

did you ever hear such a paltry coward 
said bletson apart to everard do tarry
however mine honoured colonel i know your
zeal to assist the distressed and you see desborough
is in that predicament that he will
require near him more than one good example to
prevent him thinking ghosts and fiends
 i am sorry i cannot oblige you gentleman's
said everard but i have settled my mind w
gti woodstock
sleep in victor lee's apartment so i wish you
good night and if you would repose without
disturbance i would advise that you commend
yourselves during the watches the night to
him unto whom night is even as midday i
had intended to have spoke with you this evening
on the subject my being here but i will
defer the conference till tomorrow when i
think i will be able to show you excellent reasons
for leaving woodstock
we have seen plenty such already said
desborough for one i came here to serve the
estate with some moderate advantage doubtless
to myself for my trouble but if i am set upon
my head again tonight as i was the night before
i would not stay longer to gain a king's crown
for i am sure my neck would be unfitted to bear
the weight it
good night exclaimed everard and was
about to go when bletson again pressed close
and whispered to him hark thee colonel you
know my friendship for thee i do implore thee
to leave the door thy apartment open that if
thou meekest with any disturbance i may hear
thee call and be with thee upon the very instant
woodstock 
do this dear everard my fears for thee will
keep me awake else for i know that notwithstanding
your excellent sense you entertain some
 those superstitious ideas which we suck in
with our mother's milk and which constitute the
ground our fears in situations like the present 
therefore leave thy door open if you love me that
you may have ready assistance from me in case
 need
my masters said wildrake trusts first
in his bible sir and then in his good sword
he has no idea that the devil can be baffled by
the charm two men lying in one room still
less that the foul fiend can be argued out existence
by the nuuifidians the rota
everard seized his imprudent friend by the
collar and dragged him off as he was speaking
keeping fast hold him till they were both in
the chamber victor lee where they had slept
on a former occasion even then he continued
to hold wildrake until the servant had arranged
the lights and was dismissed from the room 
then letting him go addressed him with the upbraiding
question art thou not a prudent and
 woodstock
sagacious person who in times like these seek
every opportunity to argue yourself into a broil
or embroil yourself in an argument out on
you 
ay out on me indeed said the cavalier 
out on me for a poor tamespirited creature j
that submits to be bandied about in this manners
by a man who is neither better born nor better
bred than myself i tell thee mark you
make an unfair use your advantages over me
why will you not let me go from you and live
and die after my own fashion 
because before we had been a week separate
i should hear your dying after the fashion
 a dog come my good friend what
madness was it in thee to fall foul on harrison
and then to enter into useless argument with
bletson 
why we are in the devil's house i think
and i would willingly give the landlord his due
wherever i travel to have sent him harrison
or bletson now just as a lunch to stop his appetite
till from 
hush stone walls have ears said everard
woodstock 
looking around him here stands thy nightdrink
look to thy arms for we must be as careful
as if the avenger blood were behind us
yonder is thy bed and i as thou seest have
one prepared in the parlour the door only
divides us
which i will leave open in case thou should'st
hollo for assistance as yonder nuuifidian hath
it but how hast thou got all this so well put in
order good patron f
i gave the steward tomkins notice ray
purpose to sleep here
a strange fellow that said wildrake and
as i judge has taken measure every one's
foot all seems to pass through his hands
 he is i have understood replied everard
one the men formed by the times has a
ready gift preaching and expounding which
keeps him in high terms with the independents 
and recommends himself to the more moderate
people by his intelligence and activity
has his sincerity ever been doubted said
wildrake
never that i heard said io colonel 
vol k
 woodstock
on the contrary he has been familiarly called
honest joe and trusty tomkins for my part
i believe his sincerity has always kept pace with
his interest but come finish thy cup and to
bed what all emptied at one draught 
 adszookers yes my vow forbids me to
make two on't but never fear the nightcap
will only warm my brain not clog it so manor
devil give me notice if you are disturbed and
rely on me in a twinkling so saying the cavalier
retreated into his separate apartment and
colonel everard taking off the most cumbrous
part his dress lay down in his hose and doublet
and composed himself to rest
he was awakened from sleep by a slow and
solemn strain music which died away as at a
distance he started up and felt for his arms
which he found close beside him his temporary
bed being without curtains he could look
around him without difficulty but as there remained
in the chimney only a few red embers 
the fire which he had arranged before he went to
sleep it was impossible he could discern anything
he felt therefore in spite his natural
courage that undefined and thrilling species 
woodstock 
tremor which attends a sense that danger is near
and an uncertainty concerning its cause and character
reluctant as hews to yield belief to supernatural
occurrences we have already said he was
not absolutely incredulous as perhaps even in
this more sceptical age there are many fewer
complete and absolute infidels on this particular
than give themselves out for such uncertain
whether he had not dreamed these sounds
which seemed yet in his ears he was unwilling
to risk the raillery his friend by summoning
him to his assistance he sat up therefore in
his bed not without experiencing that nervous
agitation to which brave men as well as cowards are
subject with this difference that the one sinks
under it like the vine under the hailstorm and
the other collects his energies to shake it off as
the cedar lebanon is said to elevate its boughs
to disperse the snow which accumulates upon
them
the story harrison in his own absolute
despite and notwithstanding a secret suspicion
which he had trick or connivance returned on
his mind at this dead and solitary hour harrison
he remembered had described the vision
g woonstoik
iy a circumstance its appearance different from
that which his own remark had been calculated
to suggest to the mind the visionary that
bloody napkin always pressed to the side was
then a circumstance present either to his bodily
eye or to that his agitated imagination did
then the murdered revisit the living haunts
 those who had forced them from the stage
with all their sins unaccounted for and if they
did might not the same permission authorize
other visitations a similar nature to warn to
instruct to punish rash are they was his conclusion
and credulous who receive as truth every
tale the kind but no less rash may it be to
limit the power the creator over the works
which he has made and to suppose that by the
permission the author nature the laws 
nature may not in peculiar cases and for high
purposes be temporarily suspended
while these thoughts passed through everard's
mind feelings unknown to him even when
he stood first on the rough and perilous edge 
battle gained ground upon him he feared he
knew not what and where an open and discernible
peril would have drawn out his courage the
woods k 
absolute uncertainty his situation increased
his sense the danger he felt an almost irresistible
desire to spring from his bed and heap
fuel on the dying embers expecting by the blaze
to see some strange sight in his chamber he
was also strongly templed to awaken wildrake 
but shame stronger than fear itself checked
these impulses what should it be thought
that markham everard held one the best soldiers
who had drawn a sword in this sad war 
markham everard who had obtained such distinguished
rank in the army the parliament
though so young in years was afraid remaining
by himself in a twilightroom at midnight
it never should be said
this was however no charm for his unpleasant
current thought there rushed on his
mind the various traditions victor lee's chamber
which though he had often despised them
as vague unauthenticated and inconsistent rumours
engendered by ancient superstition and
transmitted from generation to generation by
loquacious rrcduhty had yet something in them
which did not tend to allay the present imo
woodstock
pleasant state his nerves then when he
recollected the events that very afternoon
the weapon pressed against his throat and the
strong arm which threw him backward on the
floor if the remembrance served to contradict
the idea flitting phantoms and unreal daggers
it certainly induced him to believe that
there was in some part this extensive mansion
a party cavaliers or malignant harboured
who might arise in the night overpower the
guards and execute upon them all but on harrison
in particular as one the regicide judges
that vengeance which was so eagerly thirsted forby
the attached followers the slaughtered monarch

he endeavoured to console himself on this
subject by the number and position the
guards yet still was dissatisfied with himself for
not having taken yet more exact precautions and
for keeping an extorted promise silence which
might consign so many his party to the danger
 assassination these thoughts connected
with his military duties awakened another train
 reflections he bethought himself that all he
woodstock 
could now do was to visit the sentries and ascertain
that they were awake alert on the watch
and so situated that in time need they might
be ready to support each other this better
befits me he thought than to be here like a
child frightening myself with the old woman's
legend which i have laughed at when a boy
what if old victor lee was a sacrilegious man
as common report goes and brewed ale in the
font which he brought from the ancient palace 
holyrood while church and building were inflames
 and what if his eldest son was when a
child scalded to death in the same vessel how
many churches have been demolished since his
time how many fonts desecrated so many
indeed that were the vengeance heaven to
visit such aggressions in a supernatural manner
no corner in england no not the most petty
parish church but would have its apparition 
tush these are idle fancies unworthy especially
to be entertained by those educated to believe
that sanctity resides in the intention and the act
not in the buildings or fonts or the form worship

 woodstock
as thus he called together the articles his
calvinistic creed the bell the great clock a
token seldom silent in such narratives tolled three
and was immediately followed by the hoarse call
 the sentinels through vault and gallery upstairs
and beneath challenging and answering
each other with the usual watchword all's well
their voices mingled with the deep boom the
bell yet ceased before that was silent and when
they had died away the tingling echo the prolonged
knell was scarcely audible ere yet that
last distant tingling had finally subsided into silence
it seemed as if it again was awakened and
everard could hardly judge at first whether a new
echo had taken up the falling cadence or whether
some other and separate sound was disturbing
anew the silence to which the deep knell had as
its voice ceased consigned the ancient mansion
and the woods around it
but the doubt was soon cleared up the musical
tones which had mingled with the dying
echoes the knell seemed at first to prolong
and afterwards to survive them a wild strain
 melody beginning at a distance and growwoodstock

ing louder as it advanced seemed to pass from
room to room from cabinet to gallery from
hall to bower through the deserted and dishonoured
ruins the ancient residence so many
sovereigns and as it approached no soldier gave
alarm nor did any the numerous guests various
degrees who spent an unpleasant and terrified
night in that ancient mansion seem to dare to
announce to each other the inexplicable cause 
apprehension
everard's excited state mind did not permit
him to be so passive the sounds approached so
nigh that it seemed they were performing in the
very next apartment a solemn service for the dead
when he gave the alarm by calling loudly to his
trusty attendant and friend wildrake who slumbered
in tht next chamber with only a door betwixt
them and even that ajar
wildrake wildrake up up dost thou
not hear the alarm 
there was no answer from wildrake though
the musical sounds which now rung through the
apartment as if the performers had actually been
within its precincts would have been sufficient to
 woodstock
awaken a sleeping person even without the shout
 his comrade and patron
alarm roger wildrake arm again
called everard getting out bed and graspinghis
weapons get a light and cry alarm
there was no answer his voice died away as
the sound the music seemed also to die and
the same soft sweet voice which still to his thinking
resembled that alice lee was heard in his
apartment and as he thought at no distance from
him
your comrade will not answer said the low
soft voice those only hear the alarm whose
consciences feel the call
again this mummery said edward i
am better armed than i was late and but for
the sound that voice the speaker had bought
his trifling dear
it was singular we may observe in passing that
the instant the distinct sounds the human voice
were heard by everard all idea supernatural
interference was at an and the charm by
which he had been formerly fettered appeared to
be broken so much is the influence imaginary
woodblock 
or superstitious terror dependant so far as respects
strong judgments at least upon what is
vague or ambiguous and so readily do distinct
tones and express ideas bring such judgments
back to the current ordinary life the voice returned
answer as addressing his thoughts as well
as his words
 we laugh at the weapons thou thickest
should terrify us over the guardians woodstock
they have no power fire if thou wilt
and try the effect thy weapons but know
it is not our purpose to harm thee thou art a
falcon breed and noble in thy disposition though
unreclaimed and ill nurtured thou haunted with
kites and carrion crows wing thy flight from
hence on the morrow for if thou tarriest with
the bats owls vultures and ravens which have
thought to nestle here thou wilt inevitably share
their fate away then that these halls may be
swept and garnished for reception those who
have a better right to inhabit them
everard answered in a raised voice once
more i warn you think not to defy me in vain i
am no child to be frightened by goblins tales and
 woodstock
no coward armed as i am to be alarmed at the
threats banditti if i give you a moment's indulgence
it is for the sake dear and misguided
friends who may be concerned with this dangerous
gambol know i can bring a troop soldiers
round the castle who will search its most inward
recesses for the author this audacious frolic 
and if that search should fail it will cost but a
few barrels gunpowder to make the mansion a
heap ruins and bury under them the authors 
such an illjudged pastime
you speak proudly sir colonel said another
voice similar to that harsher and stronger
tone by which he had been addressed in the gallery
 try your courage in this direction
you should not dare me twice said colonel
everard had i a glimpse light to take aim
by
as he spoke a sudden gleam light was
thrown with a brilliancy which almost dazzled
the speaker showing distinctly a form somewhat
resembling that victor lee as represented
in his picture holding in the one hand a
lady completely veiled and in the other his leadwoodstock

kingstaff or truncheon both figures were animated
and as it appeared standing within six
feet him
were it not for the woman said everard
i would not be thus mortally dared
spare not for the female form but do your
worst replied the same voice i defy you
repeat your defiance when i have counted
thrice said everard and take the punishment
 your insolence once i have cocked my pistol
 twice i never missed my aim by all that
is sacred i fire if you do not withdraw when
i pronounce the next number i will shoot you
dead where you stand i am yet unwilling to shed
blood i give you another chance flight once
twice thrice
everard aimed at the bosom and discharged his
pistol the figure waved its arm in an attitude 
scorn and a loud laugh arose during which the
light as gradually growing weaker danced and
glimmered upon the apparition the aged knight
and then disappeared everard's lifeblood ran
cold to his heart had he been human mould
 woodstock
ie thought the bullet must have pierce him
and i have neither will nor power to fight with
supernaturalal beings
the feeling oppression was now so strong as
to be actually sickening he groped his way
however to the fireside and flung on the embers
which were yet gleaming a handful dry fuel
it presently blazed and afforded him light to seethe
room in every direction he looked cautiously
almost timidly around and half expected
some horrible phantom to become visible but he
saw nothing save the old furniture the 
and other articles which had been left
in the same state as when sir henry lee departed
he felt an uncontrollable desire mingled
with much repugnance to look at the portrait 
the ancient knight which the form he had seen
so strongly resembled he hesitated betwixt the
opposing feelings but at length snatched with desperate
resolution the taper which he had extinguished
and relighted it ere the blaze the fuel
had again died away he held it up to the ancient
portrait victor lee and gazed on it
with eager curiosity not unmingled with fear
woodstock 
almost the childish terrors his earlier days returned
and he thought the severe pale eye the
ancient warrior followed his and menaced him
with its displeasure and although he quickly
argued himself out such an absurd belief yet
the mixed feelings his mind were expressed in
words that seemed half addressed to the ancient
portrait
soul my mother's ancestor he said be
it for weal or for woe by designing men or by
supernatural beings that these ancient halls are
disturbed i am resolved to leave them on the
morrow
i rejoice to hear it with all my soul said a
voice behind him
he turned saw a tall figure in white with a
sort turban upon its head and dropping the
candle in the exertion instantly grappled with it
thou at least art palpable he said
palpable answered he whom he grasped so
strongly sdeath methinks you might know
that without the risk choking me and if you
loose me not i'll show you that two can play at
the game wrestling
 woodstock
roger wiklrakc said everard letting the
cavalier loose and stepping back
 roger wildrake ay truly did you take
me for roger bacon come to help you to raise
the devil for the place smells sulphur consumedly

it is the pistol i fired did you not hear
it
why yes it was the first thing waked me 
for that night cap which i pulled on made me
sleep like a dormouse pshaw i feel my brains
giddy with it yet
and wherefore came you not on the instant 
i never needed help more
i came as fast as i could answered wildrake
 but it was some time ere i got my senses
collected for i was dreaming that cursed field
at naseby and then the door my room was
shut and hard to open till i played the locksmith
with my foote
how it was open when i went to bed said
everard
 it was locked when i came out bed though
is
woodstock 
said wildrake and i marvel you heard me not
when i forced it opens
my mind was occupied otherwise said everard

well said wildrake but what has happened
 here am i bolt upright and ready to
fight if this yawning fit will give me leave mother
redcap's mightiest is weaker than i drank
last night by a bushel to a barleycorn i have
quaffed the very elixir malt ha yaw
and some opiate besides i should think
said everard
very like very like less than the pistolshot
would not waken me even me who with but
an ordinary gracecup sleep as lightly as a maiden
on the first may when she watches for the
earliest beam to go to gather dew but what are
you about to do next 
nothing answered everard
nothing said wildrake in surprise
i speak it said colonel everard less for
your information than for that others who may
hear me that i will leave the lodge this mornvol
 f
 woodstock
ing and if it is possible remove the commissioners

 hark said wildrake do you not hear
some noise hke the distant sound the applause
 a theatre the goblins the place rejoice in
your departure
i shall leave woodstock said everard to
the occupation my uncle sir henry lee and
his family if they choose to resume it not that
i am frightened into this as a concession to the
series artifices which have been played off on
this occasion but solely because such was my intention
from the beginning but let me warn he
added raising his voices let me warn the parties
concerned in this combination that though it
may pass off successfully on a fool like lesbos
a visionary like harrison a coward like
bletson 
here a voice distinctly spoke as standing near
them or a wise moderate and resolute person
like colonel everard
by heaven the voice came from the picture
said wildrake drawing his sword i will pink
his plaited armour for him
woodstock s
ojfter no violence said everard startled at
the interruption but resuming with firmness what
he was saying let those engaged be aware that
however this string artifices may be immediately
successful it must when closely looked into be
attended with the punishment all concerned 
the total demolition woodstock and the irremediable
downfall the family lee let all
concerned think this and desist in time
he paused and almost expected a reply but
none came
it is a very odd thing said wildrakc but
yawha my brain cannot compass it just now 
it whirls round like a toast in a bowl muscadine
 i must sit down hewyaw and discuss it
at leisure gramercy good elbowchair
so saying he threw himself or rather sank
gradually down on a large easy chair which had
been often pressed by the weight stout sir
henry lee and in an instant was sound asleep
everard was far from feeling the same inclination
for slumber yet his mind was relieved the apprehension
 any farther visitation that night 
for he considered his treaty to evacuate woods
woodstock
stock as made known to and accepted in all probability
by those whom the intrusion the commissioners
had induced to take such singular measures
for expelling them his opinion which had
for a time bent towards a belief in something supernatural
in the disturbances had now returned
to the more rational mode accounting for them
by dexterous combination for which such a mansion
as woodstock afforded so many facilities
he heaped the hearth with fuel lighted the
candle and examining poor wildrake's situation
adjusted him as easily in the chair as he could the
cavalier stirring his limbs no more than an infant
his situation went far in his patron's opinion to
infer trick and confederacy for ghosts have no occasion
to drug men's possets he threw himself on
the bed and while he thought these strange circumstances
over a sweet and low strain music stole
through the chamber the words good night 
good night good night thrice repeated each
time in a softer and more distant tone seeming to
assure him that the goblins and he were at truce
if not at peace and that he had no more disturbance
to expect that night he had scarcely the courage
woodstock 
to call out a good night for after all his conviction
 the existence a trick it was so well performed
as to bring with it a feeling fear just like
what an audience feel during the performance 
a tragic scene which they know to be unreal and
which yet affects their passions by its near approach
to nature sleep overtook him at last and
left him not till broad daylight on the ensuing
morning

chapter 
ami yonder shines aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
troop home to churchyard
midsummer's nights drcatn
with the fresh air and the rising morning
every feeling the preceding night had passed
away from colonel everard's mind excepting wonder
how the effects which he had witnessed could be
produced he examined the whole room sounding
bolt floor and wainscot with his knuckles
and cane but was unable to discern any secret
passages while the door secured by a strong cross
bolt and the lock besides remained as firm as when
he had fastened it on the preceding evening the
apparition resembling victor lee next called his
attention ridiculous stories had been often cir
woodstock 
related this figure or one exactly resembling
it having been met with by night among the
waste apartments and corridors the old palace 
and markham everard had often heard such in
his childhood he was angry to recollect his own
deficiency courage and the thrill which he felt
on the preceding night when by confederacy
doubtless such an object was placed before his
eyes
surely he said this fit childish folly
could not make me miss my aim more likely
that the bullet had been withdrawn clandestinely
from my pistol
he examined that which was undischarged he
found the bullet in it he investigated the apartment
opposite to the point at which he had fired
and at five feet from the door in a direct line between
the bedside and the place where the appearances
had been seen a pistolball had recently
buried itself in the wainscot he had little doubt
therefore that he had fired in a just direction 
and indeed to have arrived at the place where it
was lodged the bullet must have passed through
 woodstock
the appearance at which he aimed and proceeded
point blank to the wall beyond this was mysterious
and induced him to doubt whether the art 
witchcraft or conjuration had not been called in to
assist the machinations those daring conspirators
who being themselves mortal might nevertheless
according to the universal creed the
times have invoked and obtained assistance from
the inhabitants another world
his next investigation respected the picture 
victor lee itself he examined it minutely as he
stood on the floor before it and compared its pale
shadowy faintlytraced outlines its faded colours
the stern repose the eye and deathlike pallidness
 the countenance with its different aspect on
the preceding night when illuminated by the artificial
light which fell full upon it while it left
every other part the room in comparative darkness
the features seemed then to have an unnatural
glow while the rising and falling the flame in
the chimney gave the head and limbs something
which resembled the appearance actual motion
now seen by day it was a mere picture the
woodstock 
hard and ancient school holbein formerly it
seemed for the moment something more determined
to get to the bottom this contrivance if
possible everard by the assistance a table and
chair examined the portrait still more closely and
endeavoured to ascertain the existence any private
spring by which it might be slipt aside a
contrivance not unfrequent in ancient buildings
which usually abounded with means access and
escape communicated to none but the lords the
castle or their immediate confidents but the
panel on which victor lee was painted was
firmly fixed in the wainscoting the apartment
 which it made a part and the colonel satisfied
himself that it could not hav been used for the
purpose which he had suspected
he next aroused his faithful squire wildrake
who notwithstanding his deep share the blessedness
 sleep had scarce even yet got rid 
the effects the gracecup the preceding evening
 it was the reward according to his own
view the matter his temperance one
single draught having made him sleep more late
and more sound than a matter halfadozen or
 woodstock
from thence to a dozen pulls would have done
when he was guilty the enormity reresup
pers and drinking deep after them
had your temperate draught said everard
 been but a thought more strongly seasoned
wildrake thou hadst slept so sound that the last
trump only could have waked thee
and then answered wildrake i should
have waked with a headache mark for i see my
modest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue
 but let us go forth and see how the night
which we have passed so strangely has been spent
by the rest them i suspect they are all right
willing to evacuate woodstock unless they have
cither rested better than we or at least been more
lucky in lodgings
in that case i will dispatch thee down to

continued through the subsequent reign the supper took place
at an early hour six or seven o'clock at latest the weresupper
was a preliminary banquet a hors d'auvrc which made its appearance
at ten or eleven and served as an apology for prolonging
the entertainment till midnight
woodstock 
henry lee and his family into their old apartments
where my interest with the general being
joined with the indifferent repute the place
itself i think they have little chance being disturbed
either by the present or by any new commissioners

but how are they to defend themselves
against the fiends my gallant colonel said
wildrake methinks had i an interest in
yonder pretty girl such as thou dost boast i
should be loath to expose her to the terrors a
residence at woodstock where these devils i
beg their pardon for i suppose they hear every
word we sly these merry goblins make such
gay work from twilight till morning
my dear wildrake said the colonel i
as well as you believe it possible that our speech
may be overheard but i care not and will speak
my mind plainly i trust sir henry and alice
are not engaged in this silly plot i cannot reconcile
it with the pride the one the modesty
 the other or the good sense both that any
motive could engage them in so strange a conjunction
but the fiends arc all your own political
 woodstock
persuasion wildrake all trueblue cavaliers and
i am convinced that sir henry and alice lee
though they be unconnected with them have not
the slightest cause to be apprehensive their
goblin machinations besides sir henry and jofeline
must know every corner about the place it
will be far more difficult to play off any ghostly
machinery upon him than upon strangers but
let us to our toilette and when water and brush
hath done its work we will inquire what is next
to be done
nay that wretched puritan's garb mine is
hardly worth brushing said wildrake and
but for this hundred weight rusty iron with
which thou hast bedizened me i look more like
a bankrupt quaker than anything else but i'll
make you as spruce as ever was a canting rogue
 your party

e full tide remorseful
passion had for the time abated it was however
fierce and agitating the more so perhaps that
indulgence in strong mental feeling any kind
was foreign to the severe and ascetic character 
the man and was therefore the more overpowering
when it had at once surmounted all restraints
large tears flowed down the trembling features
 his thin and usually stern or at least austere
countenance he eagerly returned the compression
 everard's hand as if thankful for the sympathy
which the caress implied
presently after master holdenough wiped his
eyes withdrew his hand gently from that everard
shaking it kindly as they parted and prowoodstock

needed with more composure forgive me this
burst passionate feeling worthy colonel i
am conscious it little becomes a man my cloth
who should be the bearer consolation to others
to give way in mine own person to an extremity
 grief weak at least if indeed it is not sinful 
for what are we that we should weep and murmur
touching that which is permitted but albany
was to me as a brother the happiest days
 my ife ere my call to mingle myself in the
strife the land had awakened me to my duties
were spent in his company i but i will make
the rest my story short here he drew
his chair close to that everard and spoke ina
solemn and mysterious tone voice almost
lowered to a whisper i saw him last night
saw mm saw whom said everard can
you mean the person whom 
whom i saw so ruthlessly slaughtered
said the clergyman my ancient collegefriend
joseph albany
 master holdenough your cloth and your
character alike must prevent your jesting on such
a subject as this
vol 
 woodstock
jesting answered holdenough i would
as soon jest on my deathbed as soon jest upon
the bible
 but you must have been deceived answered
everard hastily this tragical story necessarily
often returns to your mind and in moments when
the imagination overcomes the evidence the
outward senses your fancy must have presented
to you an unreal appearance nothing more likely
when the mind is on the stretch after something
supernatural than that the imagination should
supply the place with a chimera while the overexcited
feelings render it difficult to dispel the
delusion
colonel everard replied holdenough with
austerity in discharge my duty i must not
fear the face man and therefore i tell you
plainly as i have done before with more observance
that when you bring your carnal learning
and judgment as it is but too much your nature
to do to investigate the hidden things another
world you might as well measure with the palm
 your hand the waters the isis indeed good
sir you err in this and give men too much pretence
to confound your honourable name with witchwoodstock

advocates freethinkers and atheists even with
such as this man bletson who if the discipline
 the church had its hands strengthened as it
was in the beginning the great conflict would
have been long ere now cast out the pale and
delivered over to the punishment the flesh
that his spirit might if possible be yet saved
you mistake master holdenough said colonel
everard i do not deny the existence 
such preternatural visitations because i cannot
and dare not raise the voice my own opinion
against the testimony ages supported by such
learned men as yourself nevertheless though i
grant the possibility such things i have scarce
yet heard an instance in ray days so well fortified
by evidence that i could at once and distinctly
say this must have happened by supernatural
agency and not otherwise
hear then what i have to tell said the divine
 on the faith a man a christian and
what is more a servant our holy church 
and therefore though unworthy an elder and a
teacher among christians i had taken my post
yester evening in the halffurnished apartment
 woodstock
wherein hangs a huge mirror which might have
served goliath gath to have admired himself
in when clothed from head to foot in his brazen
armour i the rather chose this place because
they informed me it was the nearest habitable
room to the gallery in which they say you had
been yourself assailed that evening by the evil
one was it so i pray you 
 by some one with no good intentions i was
assailed in that apartment so far said colonel
everard you were correctly informed
well i chose my post as well as i might
even as a resolved general approaches his camp
and casts up his mound as nearly as he can to
the besieged city and a truth colonel everard
if i felt some sensation bodily fear for
even elias and the prophets who commanded the
elements had a portion in our frail nature much
more such a poor sinful being as myself yet was
my hope and my courage high and i thought
 the texts which i might use not in the wicked
sense perhaps or spells as the blinded papists
employ them together with the sign the cross
and other fruitless forms but as nourishing and
woodstock itkj
supporting that true trust and confidence in the
blessed promises being the true shield faith
wherewith the fiery darts satan may be withstood
and quenched and thus armed and prepared
i sate me down to read at the same time
to write that i might compel my mind to attend
to those subjects which became the situation in
which i was placed as preventing any unlicensed
excursions the fancy and leaving no room for
my imagination to brood over idle fears so i
methodized and wrote down what i thought
meet for the time and peradventure some hungry
souls may yet profit by the food which i then
prepared
it was wisely and worthily done good and
reverend sir replied colonel everard i pray
you to proceed
while i was thus employed sir and had been
upon the matter for about three hours not yielding
to weariness a strange thrilling came over my
senses and the large and oldfashioned apartment
seemed to wax larger more gloomy and
more cavernous while the air the night grew
more cold and chill i know not if it was that
 woodstock
the fire began to decay or whether there cometh
before such things as were then about to happen
a breath and atmosphere as it were terror
as job saith in a wellknown passage fear
came upon me and trembling which made my
bones to shake and there was a tingling noise
in my ears and a dizziness in my brain so that
i felt like those who call for aid when there is no
danger and was even prompted to flee when i
saw no one to pursue it was then that something
seemed to pass behind me casting a reflection
on the great mirror before which i had placed
my writingtable and which i saw by assistance
 the great standing light which was then
in front the glass and i looked up and i saw
in the glass distinctly the appearance a man's
sure as these words issue from my mouth it
was no other than the same joseph albany the
companion my youth he whom iliad seen precipitated
down the battlements clidesthrough
castle into the deep lake below
what did you do 
it suddenly rushed on my mind said the
divine that the stoical philosopher athenodorus
woodstock 
had eluded the horrors such a vision by patiently
pursuing his studies and it shot at the same
time across my mind that i a christian divine
and a steward the mysteries had less reason
to fear evil and better matter on which to employ
my thoughts than was possessed by a heathen
who was blinded even by his own wisdom
so instead betraying any alarm or even turning
my head around i pursued my writing but
with a beating heart i admit and with a throbbing
hand
if you could write at all said the colonel
with such an impression on your mind you
may take the head the english array for
dauntless resolution
our courage is not our own colonel said
the divine and not as ours should it be vaunted
 and again when you speak this strange
vision as an impression on my fancy and not a
reality obvious to my senses let me tell you once
more your worldly wisdom is but foolishness
touching the things that are not worldly
did you not look again upon the mirror
said the colonel
 woodstock
 i did when i had copied out the comfortable
text thou shalt tread down satan under
thy feet 
and what did you then see 
the reflection the same joseph albany
said holdenough passing slowly as from behind
my chair the same in member and lineament
that i had known him in his youth excepting
that his cheek had the marks the more advanced
age at which he died and was very pale
what did you then 
i turned from the glass and plainly saw the
figure which had made the reflection in the mirror
retreating towards the door not fast nor
slow but with a gliding steady pace it turned
again when near the door and again showed me
its pale ghastly countenance before it disappeared
but how it left the room whether by the
door or otherwise my spirits were too much
hurried to remark exactly nor have i been able
by any effort recollection distinctly to remember

this is a strange and as coming from you
a most excellently wellattested apparition anwoodstock
s
jweredeverard and yet master holdenough
if the other world has been actually displayed
as you apprehend and i will not dispute the possibility
assure yourself there are also wicked
men concerned in these machinations i myself
have undergone some rencontres with visitants
who possessed bodily strength and wore i am
sure earthly weapons
oh doubtless doubtless replied master
holdenough beelzebub loves to charge with
horse and foot mingled as was the fashion the
old scotch general davie leslie he has his
devils in the body as well as his devils disembodied
and uses the one to support and back the
other
it may be as you say reverend sir answered
the colonel but what do you advise in
this case 
for that i must consult with my brethren
said the divine and if there be but left in our
borders five ministers the true kirk we will
charge satan in full body and you shall see whether
we have not power over him to resist till he
 woodstock
shall flee from us but failing that ghostly armament
against these strange and unearthly enemies
truly i would recommend that as a house
 witchcraft and abomination this polluted den
 ancient tyranny and prostitution should be totally
consumed by fire lest satan establishing
his headquarters so much to his mind should
find a garrison and a fastness from which he might
sally forth to infest the whole neighbourhood
certain it is that i would recommend to no christian
soul to inhabit the mansion and if deserted
it would become a place for wizards to play
their pranks and witches to establish their sabbath
and those who like dumas go about after
the wealth this world seeking for gold and
silver to practise spells and charms to the prejudice
 the souls the covetous trust me therefore
it were better that it were spoiled and broken
down not leaving one stone ripon another
 i say nay to that my good friend said the
colonel for the lordgeneral hath permitted
by his licence my mother's brother sir henry
lee and his family to return into the house 
his fathers being indeed the only roof under
woodstock 
which he hath any chance obtaining shelter
for his grey hairs
and was this done by your advice markham
everard said the divine austerely
 certainly it was returned the colonel
 and wherefore should i not exert mine influence
to obtain a place refuge for the brother
 my mother
 now as sure as thy soul liveth answered
the presbyter i had believed this from no
tongue but thine own tell me was it not this
very sir henry lee who by the force his
bufifcoats and his greenjerkins enforced the papist
laic's order to remove the altar to the eastern
 the church at woodstock and did not
he swear by his beard that he would hang in the
very street woodstock whoever should deny to
drink the king's health and is not his hand
red with the blood the saints and hath there
been a suffer in the field for prelacy and high
prerogative more unmitigated or fiercer 
all this may have been as you say good
master holdenough answered the colonel 
 but my uncle is now old and feeble and hath
 woodstock
scarce a single follower remaining and his daughter
is a being whom to look upon would make
the sternest weep for pity a being who
 who is dearer toeverardsaidholdenough
than his good name his faith to his friends
his duty to his religion this is no time to speak
with sugared lips the paths in which you tread
are dangerous you are striving to raise the
papistical candlestick which heaven in its justice
removed out its place to bring back to
this hall sorceries those very sinners who are
bewitched with them i will not permit the land
to be abused by their witchcraft they shall
not come hither
he spoke this with vehemence and striking
his stick against the ground and the colonel
very much dissatisfied began to express himself
haughtily in return you had better consider
your power to accomplish your threats master
holdenough he said before you urge them
so peremptorily
 and have i not the power to bind and to
loose f said the clergyman
it is a power little available save over those
woodstock 
 your own church said everard with a tone
something contemptuous
take heed take heed said the divine who
though an excellent was as we have elsewhere
seen an irritable man do not insult me but
think honourably the messenger for the sake
 him whose commission he carries do not
i say defy me i am bound to discharge my
duty were it to the displeasing my twin brother

 i can see nought your office has to do in the
matter said colonel everard and i on my
side give you warning not to attempt to meddle
beyond your commission
right you hold me already to be as submissive
as one your grenadiers replied the
clergyman his acute features trembling with a
sense indignity so as even to agitate his grey
hair but beware sir i am not so powerless as
you suppose i will invoke every true christian
in woodstock to gird up his loins and resist the
restoration prelacy oppression and malignancy
within our borders i will stir up the wrath 
the righteous against the oppressor the 
woodstock
ite the edomite and against his race and
against those who support him and encourage
him to rear up his horn i will call aloud and
spare not and arouse the many whose love hath
waxed cold and the multitude who care for
none these things there shall be a remnant
to listen to me and i will take the stick joseph
which was in the hand ephraim and
go down to cleanse this place witches and sorcerers
and enchantments and will cry and exhort
saying will you plead for baal will
you serve him nay take the prophets baal
let not a man escape
master holdcnough master holdenough
said colonel everardwith much impatience by
the tale yourself told me you have exhorted upon
that text once too often already
the old man struck his palm forcibly against
his forehead and fell back into a chair as these
words were uttered as suddenly and as much
without power resistance as if the colonel
had fired a pistol through his head instantly
regretting the reproach which he had suffered
to escape him in his impatience everard hastenwoodstock

ed to apologize and to offer every conciliatory
excuse however inconsistent which occurred to
him on the moment but the old man was too
deeply affected he rejected his hand lent no
ear to what he said and finally started up saying
sternly you have abused my confidence
sir abused it vilely to turn it into my own reproach
 had i been a man the sword you dared
not but enjoy your triumph sir over an
old man and your father's friend strike at the
wound his imprudent confidence showed you
nay my worthy and excellent friend said
the colonel
 friend answered the old man starting up
 we are foes sir foes now and for ever 
so saying and starting from the seat into which
he had rather fallen than thrown himself he ran
out the room with a precipitation step which
he was apt to use upon occasions irritable
feeling and which was certainly more eager than
dignified especially as he muttered while he ran
and seemed as if he were keeping up his own
passion by recounting over and over the offence
which he had received
soh said colonel everard and there
 woodstock
was not strife enough between mine uncle and the
people woodstock already but i must needs
increase it by chafing this irritable and quicktempered
old man eager as i knew him to be in
his ideas church government and stiff in his
prejudices respecting all who dissent from him 
the mob woodstock will rise for though
he would not get a score them to stand by him
in any honest or intelligible purpose yet let him
cry havoc and destruction and i will warrant he
has followers enow and my uncle is equally wild
and unpersuadable for the value all the estate
he ever had he would not allow a score troopers
to be quartered in the house for defence and
if he be alone or has but joceline to stand by
him he will be as sure to fire upon those who
come to attack the lodge as if he had a hundred
men in garrison and then what can chance but
danger and bloodshed 
this progress melancholy anticipation was
interrupted by the return master holdenough
who hurrying into the room with the same precipitate
pace at which he had left it ran straight
up to the colonel and said take my hand
woodstock 
markham take my hand hastily for the old
adam is whispering at my heart that it is a disgrace
to hold it extended so long
 most heartily do i receive your hand my
venerable friend said everard and i trust in
sign renewed amity
 surely surely said the divine shaking
his hand kindly thou hast it is true spoken
bitterly but thou hast spoken truth in good time
and i think though your words were severe
with a good and kindly purpose verily and 
a truth it were sinful in me again to be hasty
in provoking violence remembering that which
you have upbraided me with 
forgive me good master holdenough said
colonel everard it was a hasty word i meant
not in serious earnest to upbraid
peace i pray you peace said the divine 
i say the allusion to that which you have nost
justly upbraided me with though the charge
aroused the gall the old man within me thei
inward tempter being ever on the watch to bring
us to his lure ought instead being resented
to have been acknowledged by me as a favour for
vol n k
 woodstock
so are the wounds a friend termed faithful
and surely i who have by one unhappy exhortation
to battle and strife sent the living to the
dead and i fear brought back even the dead
amono the living should now study peace and
good will and reconciliation difference leaving
punishment to the great being whose laws
are broken and vengeance to him who hath
said i will repay it
the old man's mortified features lighted trp
with a humble confidence as he made this acknowledgment
and colonel everard who knew
the constitutional infirmities and the early prejudices
 professional consequence and exclusive
party opinion which he must have subdued ere
arriving at such a tone candour hastened to
express his admiration his christian charity
mingled with reproaches on himself for having
so deeply injured his feelings
 think not it think not it excellent
young man said holdenough we have both
erred i in suffering my zeal to outrun my charity
you perhaps in pressing hard on an ow
and peevish man who had so lately poured out
woodstock 
his sufferings into your friendly bosom be it
all forgotten let your friends if they are not
deterred by what has happened at this manor 
woodstock resume their habitation as soon as
they will if they can protect themselves against
the powers the air believe me that if i can
prevent it by aught in my power they shall have
no annoyance from earthly neighbours and
assure yourself good sir that my voice is still
worth something with the worthy mayor and
the good aldermen and the better sort housekeepers
up yonder in the town although the
lower classes are blown about with every wind
 doctrine and yet farther be assured colonel
that should your mother's brother or any 
his family learn that they have taken up a rash
bargain in returning to this unhappy and unhallowed
house or should they find any qualms in
their own hearts and consciences which require
a ghostly comforter nehemiah holdenough will
be as much at their command by night or day as
if they had been bred up within the holy pale 
the church in which he is an unworthy minister 
and neither the awe what is fearful to be seen
woodstock
within these walls nor his knowledge their
blinded and carnal state as bred up under a prelatic
dispensation shall prevent him doing what
lies in his poor abilities for their protection and
edification
 i feel all the force your kindness reverend
sir said colonel everard but i do not
think it likely that my uncle will give you trouble
on either score he is a man much accustomed
to be his own protector in temporal danger
and in spiritual doubts to trust to his own prayers
and those his church
i trust i have not been superfluous in offering
mine assistance said the old man something
jealous that his proffered spiritual aid had
been held rather intrusive i ask pardon if that
is the case i humbly ask pardon i would not
willingly be superfluous
the colonel hastened to appease this new
alarm the watchful jealousy his consequence
which joined with a natural heat temper
which he could not always subdue were the
good man's only faults
they had regained their former friendly footwoodstock

ing when roger wildrakc returned from the
hut joceline and whispered his master that
his embassy had been successful the colonel
then addressed the divine and informed him
that as the commissioners had already given up
woodstock and as his uncle sir henry lee
proposed to return to the lodge about noon he
would if his reverence pleased attend him upto
the borough
will you not tarry said the reverend man
with something like inquisitive apprehension in
his voice to welcome your relatives upon their
return to this their house 
no my good friend said colonel everard 
the part which i have taken in these unhappy
broils perhaps also the mode worship in
which i have been educated have so prejudiced
me in mine uncle's opinion that i must be for
some time a stranger to his house and family
indeed i rejoice to hear it with all my
heart and soul said the divine excuse my
frankness i do indeed rejoice i had thought
no matter what i had thought i would not
again give offence but truly though the maiden
 woodstock
hath a pleasant feature and he as all men say is
in human things unexceptionable yet but i
give you pain in sooth i will say no more unless
you ask my sincere and unprejudiced advice
which you shall command but which i will not
press on you superfluously wend we to the
borough together the pleasant solitude the
forest may dispose us to open our hearts to each
other
they did walk up to the little town in company
and somewhat to master holdenough's
surprise the colonel though they talked on various
subjects did not request him any ghostly
advice on the subject his love to his fair cousin
while greatly beyond the expectation the
soldier the clergyman kept his word and in his
own phrase was not so superfluous as to ofler
upon so delicate a point his unasked counsel
woodstock lol
chap tell 
tlicn are the harpies gone yet ere we perch
wticre such i'oul birth have rooted let us cieanie
the foul obscenity they've left behind themagamemnon

the embassy wildrake had been successful
chiefly through the mediation the episcopal
divine whom we formerly found acting in the
character chaplain to the family and whose
voice had great influence on many accounts with
its master
a little before high noon sir henry lee with
his small household was again in unchallenged
possession their old apartments at the lodge 
woodstock and the combined exertions joce
line jolliffe phoebe and old joan were
employed in putting to rights what the late intruders
had left in great disorder
sir henry lee had like all persons 
woodstock
city that period a love order amounting to
precision and felt like a fine lady whose dress
has been disordered in a crowd insulted and
humiliated by the rude confusion into which his
household goods had been thrown and impatient
till his mansion had been purified from all marks
 intrusion in his anger he uttered more orders
than the limited number his domestics were
likely to find time or hands to execute the
villains have left such sulphureous steams behind
them too said the old knight as if old davie
leslie and the whole scotch army had quartered
among them
it may be near as bad said joceline for
men say for certain it was the devil came down
bodily among them and made them troop off
then said the knight is the prince 
darkness a gentleman as old will shakspeare
says he never interferes with those his own
coat for the lees have been here father and
son these five hundred years without disquiet
and no sooner came these misbegotten churls
than he plays his own part among them
well one thing he and they have left us
woodstock 
said jouiffe which we may thank ihcm for 
and that is such a wellfilled larder and buttery
as has been seldom seen in woodstock lodge
this many a day carcases mutton large
rounds beef barrels confectioners ware
pipes and runlets sack muscadine ale and
what not we shall have a royal time on't through
half the winter and joan must get to salting and
pickling presently
out villain said the knight are we to
feed on the fragment such scum the earth
as these cast them forth instantly nay
checking himself that were a sin but give
them to the poor or see them sent to the owners
 and hark ye i will none their strong
liquors i would rather drink like a hermit all
my life than seem to pledge such scoundrels as
these in their leavings like a miserable drawer
who drains off the ends the bottles after the
guests have paid their reckoning and gone off
and hark ye i will taste no water from the
cistern out which these slaves have been serving
themselves fetch me down a pitcher from
rosamond's spring
 woottstock
jr
alice heard this in i unction and well iruessin
there was enough for the other members the
family to do she quietly took a small pitcher
and flinging a cloak around her walked out fiji
person to procure sir henry the water which he
desired meantime joceline said with some
hesitation that there was a man still remained
belonging to the party these strangers who
was directing about the removal some trunks
and mails which belonged to the commissioners
and who could receive his honour's commands
about the provisions
let him come hither the dialogue was
held in the hall why do you hesitate and
crumble in that manner 
only sir said joceline only perhaps
your honour might not wish to see him being the
same who on the night before last 
he paused
sent my rapier a hawking through the firmament
thou would'st say why when did i
take spleen at a man for standing his ground
against me roundhead as he is man i like
him the better that not the worse i hunger
woodstock 
and thirst to have another turn with him i have
thought on this passed ever since and i believe
videre it to try again i know a feat would control
it fetch him directly
trusty tomkins was presently ushered in
bearing himself with an iron gravity which neither
the terrors the preceding night nor the
dignified demeanour the highborn personage
before whom he stood were able for an instant
to overcome
 how now good fellow said sir henry 
i would fain see something more thy fence
which baffled me the other evening but truly
i think the light was somewhat too faint for my
old eyes take a foil man i walk here in the
hall as hamlet says and tis the breathingtime
 day with me take a foil then in thy hand
since it is your worship's desire said the
steward letting fall his long cloak and taking
the foil in his hand
 now said the knight if your fitness
speaks mine is ready methinks the very stepping
on this same old pavement hath charmed
away the gout which threatened mc sa ba
i tread as firm as a gamecock
j woodstock
they began the play with great spirit and
whether the old knight really fought more coolly
with the blunt than with the sharp weapon or
whether the steward gave him some grains 
advantage in this merely sportive encounter it is
certain sir henry had the better in the assault
his success put him into excellent humour
there said he i found your trick
nay you cheat me not twice the same waythere
was a very palpable hit why had i had
but light enough the other night but it skillsnot
speaking it here we leave off i must not
fight as we unwise cavaliers did with you roundhead
rascals beating you so often that we taught
you to beat us at last and good now tell me
why you are leaving your larder so full here 
do you think i or my family can use broken
victuals what have you no better employment
for your rounds sequestrated beef than
to leave them behind you when you shift your
quarters 
so please your honour said tomkins it
may be that you desire not the flesh beeves
 rams or goats nevertheless when you
woodstock 
know that the provisions were provided and paid
for out your own rents and stock at ditches
sequestrated to the use the state more than a
year since it may be you will have less scruple
to use them for your own behoof
rest assured that i shall said sir henry 
and glad you have helped me to a share 
mine own certainly i was an ass to suspect
your masters subsisting save at honest men's
expense
 and as for the rumps beeves continued
tomkins with the same solemnity there is a
rump at westminster which will stand us the
army much hacking and hewing yet ere it is discussed
to our mind
sir henry paused as if to consider what was
the meaning this inuendo for he was not a
person very quick apprehension but having
at length caught the meaning it he burst into
an explosion louder laughter than joccline had
seen him indulge in for a good while
right knave he said i taste thy jest 
it is the very moral the puppetshow faustus
woodstock
thus raised the devil as the parliament raised the
army and then as the devil flies away with
faustus so will the army fly away with the parliament
 or the rump as thou call'st it or sitting
part the socalled parliament and then
look you friend the very devil all hath my
willing consent to fly away with the army in its
turn from the highest general down to the lowest
drumboy nay never look fierce for the matter
remember there is daylight enough now fora
game at sharps
trusty tomkins appeared to think it best to
suppress his displeasure and observing that the
pains were ready to transport the commissioners
property to the borough took a grave leave
 sir henry lee
meantime the old man continued to pace his
recovered hall rubbing his hands and evincing
greater signs glee than he had shown since the
fatal th january
here we are again in the old frank joliffe
well victualled too how the knave solved
ray point conscience the dullest them is
a special casuist where the question concerns prowoodstock

fit look out if there are not some our own
ragged regiment lurking about to whom a bellyfull
would be a godsend joceline then his
fence joceline though the fellow foins well 
very sufficient well but thou saw'st how i dealt
with him when i had fitting light joceline
 ay and so your honour did said joceline
you taught him to know the duke norfolk
from saunders gardner i'll warrant him he
will not wish to come under your honour's thumb
again
 why i am waxing old said sir henry 
 but skill will not rust through age though
sinews must stiffen but my age is like a lusty
winter as old will says frosty but kindly 
and what if old as we are we live to see better
days yet i promise thee joceline i love this
jarring betwixt the rogues the board and the
rogues the sword when thieves quarrel true
men have a chance coming by their own
thus triumphed the old cavalier in the treble
glory having recovered his dwelling regained
as he thought his character as a man fence
and finally discovered some prospect a change
 woodstock
 times in which he was not without hopes that
something might turn up for the royal interest
meanwhile ace with a prouder and a glitter
heart than had danced in her bosom for several
days went forth with a gaiety to which she late
had been a stranger to contribute her assistance
to the regulation and supply the household
by bringing the fresh water wanted from fair rosamond's
well
perhaps she remembered that when she was
but a girl her cousin markham used among
others to make her perform that duty as presenting
the character some captive trojan princess
condemned by her situation to draw the
waters from some grecian spring for the use 
the proud victor at any rate she certainly
toyed to see her father reinstated in his ancient
habitation and the joy was not the less sincere
that she knew their return to woodstock had been
procured by means her cousin and that even
in her father's prejudiced eyes everard had been
in some degree exculpated the accusations the
old knight had brought against him and that
if a reconciliation had not yet taken place the
woodstock fil
preliminaries had been established on which such
a desirable conclusion might easily be founded
it was like the commencement a bridge when
the foundation is securely laid and the piers raised
above the influence the torrent the throwing
 the arches may be accomplished in a subsequent
season
the doubtful fate her only brother might
have clouded even this momentary gleam sunshine
 but alice had been bred up during the
close and frequent contests civil war and had
acquired the habit hoping in behalf those
dear to her until hope was lost in the present
case all reports seemed to assure her her brother's
safety
besides these causes for gaiety alice lee had
the pleasing feeling that she was restored to the
habitation and the haunts her childhood from
which she had not departed without much pain
the more felt perhaps because suppressed in
order to avoid irritating her father's sense his
misfortune finally she enjoyed for the instant
the gleam selfsatisfaction by which we see the
young and welldisposed so often animated when

they can be in common phrase helpful to those
whom they love and perform at the moment 
need some those httle domestic tasks which
age receives with so much pleasure from the
dutiful hands youth so that altogether as
she hasted through the remains and vestiges 
a wilderness already mentioned and from thence
about a bowshot into the park to bring a pitcher
 water from rosamond's spring alice
lee her features enlivened and her complexion
a little raised by the exercise had for the moment
regained the gay and brilliant vivacity 
expression which had been the characteristic 
her beauty in her earlier and happier days
this fountain old memory had been once
adorned wide architectural ornaments in the style
 the sixteenth century chiefly relating to ancient
mythology all these were now wasted and
overthrown and existed only as mosscovered
ruins while the living spring continued to furnish
its daily treasures unrivalled in purity
though the quantity was small gushing out amid
disjointed stones and bubbling through fragments
 ancient sculpture
woodstock g
with a light step and a laughing brow the
young lady lee was approaching the fountain
usually so solitary when she paused on beholding
some one seated beside it she proceeded
however with confidence though with a step
something less gay when she observed that the
person was a female some menial perhaps from
the town whom a fanciful mistress occasionally
dispatched for the water a spring supposed to
be peculiarly pure or some aged woman who
made a little trade by carrying it to the better
sort families and selling it for a trifle there
was no cause therefore for apprehension
yet the terrors the times were so great that
alice did not even see a stranger her own sex
without some apprehension denaturalized woe
usual followed the camps both armies
during the civil war who on the one side with
open profligacy and profanity on the other with
the fraudful tone fanaticism or hypocrisy exercised
nearly in like degree their talents for murder
or plunder but it was broad daylight the
distance from the lodge was but trifling and
though a little alarmed at seeing a stranger where
she expected deep solitude the daughter the
 woodstock
haughty old knight had too much the hon
about her to fear without some determined and
decided cause
alice walked therefore gravely on toward the
fount and composed her looks as she took a hasty 
glance the female who was seated there and
addressed herself to her task filling her pitcher

the woman whose presence had surprised and
somewhat startled alice lee was a person 
the lower rank whose red cloak russet kirtle
handkerchief trimmed with coventry blue and a
coarse steeple hat could not indicate at best anything
higher than the wife a small farmer or
perhaps the helpmate a bailiff or hind it was
well if she proved nothing worse her clothes
indeed were good materials but what the female
eye discerns with half a glance they were
indifferently adjusted and put on this looked as
if they did not belong to the person by whom
they were worn but were articles which she had
become the mistress by some accident if not by
some successful robbery her size too as did
not escape alice even in the short perusal she
afforded the stranger was unusual her features
woodstock 
swarthy and singularly harsh and her manner
altogether unpropitious the young lady almost
wished as she stooped to fill her pitcher that
she had rather turned back and sent joceline
on the errand but repentance was too late now
and she had only to disguise as well as she could
her unpleasant feelings
the blessings this bright day to one as
bright as it is said the stranger with no unfriendly
though a harsh voice
i thank you said alice in reply and continued
to fill her pitcher busily by assistance 
an iron bowl which remained still chained to one
 the stones beside the fountain
perhaps my pretty maiden if you would
accept my help your work would be sooner done
said the stranger
i thank you said alice but had i needed
assistance i could have brought those with
me who had rendered it
i do not doubt that my pretty maiden
answered the female there are too many lads
in woodstock with eyes in their heads no doubt
you could have brought with you any one 
them who looked on you if you had listed
 woodstock
alice replied not a syllabic lor she did not like
the freedom used by the speaker and was desirous
to break off the conversation
are you offended my pretty mistress said
the stranger that was far from my purpose
i will put my question otherwise are the
good dames woodstock so careless their
pretty daughters as to let the flower them all
wander about the wild chase without a mother
or a somebody to prevent the fox from running
away with the lamb that carelessness methinks
shows small kindness
content yourself good woman i am not far
from protection and assistance said alice who
liked less and less the effrontery her new acquaintance

alas my pretty maiden said the stranger
patting with her large and hard hand the head
which alice had kept bended down towards the
water which she was laving it would be difficult
to hear such a pipe as yours at the town 
woodstock scream as loud as you would
alice shook the woman's hand angrily off took
up her pitcher though not above half full and
as she saw the stranger rise at the same time
woojjotock c
said not without fear doubtless but with a natural
feeling resentment and dignity i have
no reason to make my cries heard as far as woodstock
were there occasion for my crying for
help at all it is nearer at hand if i need it
she spoke not without a warrant for at the
moment broke through the bushes and stood by
her side the noble hound bevis fixing on the
stranger his eyes that glanced fire raising every
hair on his gallant mane as upright as the bristles
 a wild boar when hard pressed grinning till a
case teeth which would have matched those 
any wolf in russia were displayed in full array
and without either barking or springing seeming
by his low determined growl to await but the signal
for dashing at the female whom he plainly
considered as a suspicious person
but the stranger was undaunted my pretty
maiden she said you have indeed a formidable
guardian there where cockneys or bumpkins
are concerned but we who have been at the wars
know spells for taming such furious dragons 
and therefore let not your fourfooted protector
go loose on me for he is a noble animal and 
woodstock
thing but selfdefence would induce me to do him
injury so saying she drew a pistol from her
bosom and cocked it pointing it towards the
dog as if apprehensive that he would spring
upon her
hold woman hold said alice lee the
dog will not do you harm down bevis couch
down and ere you attempt to hurt him know
he is the favourite hound sir henry lee 
ditchley the keeper woodstock park who
would severely revenge any injury offered to him
and you pretty one are the old knight's
housekeeper doubtless i have often heard the
lees have good taste
i am his daughter good woman
his daughter i was blind but yet h is
true nothing less perfect could answer the description
which all the world has given mistress
alice lee i trust that my folly has given my
young mistress no offence and that she will allow
me in token reconciliation to fill her pitcher
and carry it as far as she will permit
as you will good mother but i am about
to return instantly to the lodge to which in
woodstock 
these times i cannot admit strangers you can
follow me no farther than the verge the wilderness
and i am already too long from home 
i will send some one to meet and relieve you 
the pitcher so saying she turned her back
with a feeling terror which she could hardly
account for and began to walk quickly towards
the lodge thinking thus to get rid her troublesome
acquaintance
but she reckoned without her host for in a
moment her new companion was by her side
not running indeed but walking with prodigious
long unwomanly strides which soon brought her
up with the hurried and timid steps the frightened
maiden but her manner was more respectful
than formerly though her voice sounded remarkably
harsh and disagreeable and her whole
appearance suggested an undefined yet irresistible
feeling apprehension
pardon a stranger lovely mistress alice
said her persecutor that was not capable 
distinguishing between a lady your high quality
and a peasant wench and who spoke to you
with a degree freedom illbefitting your rank
 woodstock
certainly and condition and which i fear has
given you offence
no offence whatever replied alice but
good woman i am near home and can excuse
your farther company you are unknown tome

but it follows not said the stranger that
your fortunes may not be known to me fair mistress
alice look on my swarthy brow england
breeds none such and in the lands from
which i come the sun which blackens our complexion
pours to make amends rays knowledge
into our brains which are denied to those
 your lukewarm climate let me look upon
your pretty hand attempting to possess herself
 it and i promise you you shallhear
what will please you
i hear what does not please me said alice
with dignity you must carry your tricks 
fortunetelling and palmistry to the women 
the village we the gentry hold them to be
either imposture or unlawful knowledge
yet you would fain hear a certain colonel
i warrant you whom certain unhappy cir
woodstock 
substances have separated from his family you
would give better than silver if i could assure
you that you would see him in a day or 
perhaps sooner
i know nothing what you speak good
woman if you want alms there is a piece silver
 it is all i have in my purse
it were pity that i should take it said the
female and yet give it me for the princess
in the fairy tale must ever deserve by her generosity
the bounty the benevolent fairy before
she is rewarded by her protection
take it take it give me my pitcher
said alice and begone yonder comes one 
my father's servants what ho joceline 
joceline 
the old fortuneteller hastily dropped something
into the pitcher as she restored it to alice
lee and plying her long limbs disappeared
speedily under cover the wood
bevis turned and backed and showed some
inclination to harass the retreat this suspicious
person yet as if uncertain ran towards jolift'e
and fawned on him to demand his advice and
 woodstock
encouragement joceline pacified the animal
and coming up to his young lady asked her
with surprise what was the matter and whether
she had been frightened alice made light 
her alarm for which indeed she could not have
assigned any very competent reason for the manners
 the woman though bold and intrusive
were not menacing she only said she had meta
fortuneteller by rosamond's well and had
had some difficulty in shaking her off
ah the gipsy thief said joceline how
well she scented there was food in the pantry 
they have noses like ravens these strollers look
you mistress alice you shall not see a raven ora
carrioncrow in all the blue sky for a mile round
you but let a sheep drop suddenly down on the
greensward and before the poor creature's dead
you shall see a dozen such guests croaking
as if inviting each other to the banquet just soit
is with these sturdy beggars you will see few
enough them when there's nothing to give
but when hough's in the pot they will have share
on't
 you are so proud your fresh supply 
woodstock iii
provender said alice that you suspect all 
a design oii't i do not think this woman will
venture near your kitchen joceline
it will be best for her health said joceline
 lest i give her a ducking for digestion but
give me the pitcher mistress alice meeter i
bear it than you how now what jingles at
the bottom have you lifted the pebbles as well
as the water 
i think the woman dropped something into
the pitcher said alice
nay we must look to that for it is like to
be a charm and we have enough the devil's
ware about woodstock already we will not
spare for the water i can run back and fill the
pitcher he poured out the water upon the
grass and at the bottom the pitcher was
found a gold ring in which was set a ruby apparently
 some value
nay if this be not enchantment i know
not what is said joceline truly mistress
alice i think you had better throw away this
gimcrack such gifts from such hands are a kind
 pressmoney which the devil uses for enlisting
 woodstock
his regiment witches and if they take but so
much as a bean from him they become his bond
slaves for ife ay you look at the gewgaw but
tomorrow you will find a lead ring and a common
pebble in its stead
nay joceline i think it will be better to
find out that darkcomplexioned woman and return
to her what seems some value so cause
inquiry to be made and be sure you return herring
it seems too valuable to be destroyed
humph that is always the way with women
murmured joceline you will never get the
best them but she is willing to save a bit 
finery well mistress alice i trust that you
are too young and too pretty to be enlisted in a
regiment witches
i shall not be afraid it till you turn conjurers
said alice so hasten to the well where
you are like still to find the woman and let her
know that alice lee desires none her gifts
any more than she did her society
so saying the young lady pursued her way
to the lodge while joceline went down to rosamond's
well to execute lier commission but
woodstock 
the fortuneteller or whoever she might be was
nowhere to be found neither finding that to bethe
case did joceline give himself much trouble
in tracking her farther
if this ring which i dare say the jade stole
somewhere said the underkeeper to himself
be worth a few nobles it is better in honest
hands than in that vagabonds my master hasa
right to all waifs and strays and certainly such
a ring in possession a gipsy must be a waif
so i shall confiscate it without scruple and apply
the produce to the support sir henry s
household which is like to be poor enough thank
heaven my military experience has taught me
how to carry hooks at my fingerends that is
trooper's law yet hang it after all i had best
take it to mark everard and ask his advice i
hold him now to be your learned counsellor in law
where mistress alice's affairs are concerned and
my learned doctor who shall be nameless for
such as concern church and state and sir henry
lee and i'll give them leave to give mine tumbles
to the kites and ravens if they find me conferring
my confidence where it is not safe

being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
unguided and unfriended often prove
rough and inhospitable
twelfth night
there was a little attempt at preparation now
that the dinner hour was arrived which showed
that in the opinion his few but faithful domestics
the good knight had returned hi triumph
to his home
the great tankard exhibiting in basrelief the
figure michael subduing the archenemy was
placed on the table and joceline and phoebe
dutifully attended the one behind the chair 
sir henry the other to wait upon her young
mistress and both to make out by formal and
regular observance the want a more numerous
train
 a health to king charles said the old
knight handing the massive tankard to his
woodstock 
daughter drink it ray love though it be rebel
ale which they have left us i will pledge
thee for the toast will excuse the liquor had
noll himself brewed it
the young lady touched the goblet with her
lip and returned it to her father who took a
copious draught
i will not say blessing on their hearts said
he though i must own they drank good ale
no wonder sir they come lightly by the
malt and need not spare it said joceline
 say'st thou said the knight thou shalt
finish the tankard thyself for that very jest's sake
nor was his follower slow in doing reason to the
royal pledge he bowed and replaced the tankard
saying after a triumphant glance at the
sculpture i had a jibe with that same redcoat
about the saint michael just now
redcoat ha what redcoat said the
hasty old man do any these knaves still
lurk about woodstock quoit him down stairs
instantly joceline know we not galloway
nags 
so please you he is in some charge here
vol m
 woodstock
and will speedily begone it is he he who had
a rencontre with your honour in the wood
ay but i paid him oft for it in the hall as
you yourself saw i was never in better fence in
my life joceline that same steward fellow is
not so utterly blackhearted a rogue as the most
 them joceline he fences well excellent
well i will have thee try a bout in the hall with
him lomorrow though i think he will be too
hard for thee i know thy strength to an inch
he might say this with some truth for it was
joceline's fashion when called on as sometimes
happened to fence with his patron just to put
forth as much his strength and skill as obliged
the knight to contend hard for the victory which
in the long run he always contrived to yield upto
him like a discreet servingman
and what said this roundheaded steward
 our great saint michael's standing cup 
marry he scoffed at our good saint and
said he was little better than one the golden
calves bethel but i told him he should not
talk so until one their own roundheaded saints
iliad given the devil as complete a crossbuttock
woodstock 
as saint michael had given him as tis carved
upon the cup there i trow that made him silent
enough and then he would know whether
your honour and mistress alice not to mention
old joan and myself since it is your honour's
pleasure i should take my bed here were not
afraid to sleep in a house that had been so much
disturbed but i told him we feared no fiends
or goblins having the prayers the church read
every evening
joceline said alice interrupting him
wert thou mad you know at what risk to
ourselves and the good doctor the performance
 that duty takes place
oh mistress alice said joceline a little
abashed you may be sure i spoke not a word
 the doctor no no i did not let him into
the secret that we had such a reverend chaplain
i think i know the length this man's foot
we have had a jollification or so together he
is hand and glove with me for as great a fanatic
as he is
trust him not too far said the knight
 woodstock
 nay i fear thou hast been imprudent already
and that it will be unsafe for the good man to
come here after nightfall as is proposed these
independents have noses hke bloodhounds and
can smell out a loyalist under any disguise
if your honour thinks so said joceline
i'll watch for the doctor with good will and
bring him into the lodge by the old condemned
postern and so up to this apartment and sure
this man tomkins would never presume to come
hither and the doctor may have a bed in woodstock
lodge and he never the wiser or if your
honour does not think that safe i can cut his
throat for you and i would not mind it a pin
god forbid said the knight he is under
our roof and a guest though not an invited
one go joceline it shall be thy penance for
having given thy tongue too much license to
watch for the good doctor and to take care 
his safety while he continues with us an october
night or two in the forest would finish the
good man
he's more like to finish our october than
woodstock 
our october is to finish him said the keeper 
and withdrew under the encouraging smile his
patron
he whistled bevis along with him to share in
his watch and having received exact information
where the clergyman was most likely to be
found assured his master that he would give the
most pointed attention to his safety when the
attendants had withdrawn having previously removed
the remains the meal the old knight
leaning back in his chair encouraged pleasant
visions than had late passed through his imagination
until by degrees he was surprised by
actual slumber while his daughter not venturing
to move but on tiptoe took some needlework
and bringing it close by the old mates side
employed her fingers on this task bending her eyes
from time to time on her parent with the affectionate
zeal if not the effective power a guardian
angel at length as the light faded away and
night came on she wa about to cause candles to
be brought but remembering how indifferent 
couch jocelines cottage had afforded she could
iot think interrupting the first sound and re
 woodstock
pressing sleep which her father had enjoyed in
all probability for the last two nights and days
she herself had no other amusement as she
sat facing one the great oriel windows the
same by which wildrake had on a former occasion
looked in upon tomkins and joceline while
at their computations than watching the clouds
which a lazy wind sometimes chased from the
broad disk the harvestmoon sometimes permitted
to accumulate and exclude her brightness
there is i know not why something peculiarly
pleasing to the imagination in contemplating
the queen night when she is wading
as the expression is among the vapours which she
has not power to dispel and which on their side
are unable entirely to quench her lustre it is the
striking image patient virtue calmly pursuing
her path through good report and bad report
having that excellence in herself which ought to
command all admiration but bedimmed in the
eyes the world by suffering by misfortune by
calumny
as some such reflections perhaps were passing
through alice's imagination she became senwoodstock

bible to her surprise and alarm that some one
had clambered up upon the window and was
looking into the room the idea supernatural
fear did not in the slightest degree agitate alice
she was too much accustomed to the place and
situation for folks do not see spectres in the
scenes with which they have been familiar from infancy
but danger from marauders in a disturbed
country was a more formidable subject apprehension
and the thought armed alice who was
naturally highspirited with such desperate courage
that she snatched a pistol from the wallon
which some firearms hung and while she
screamed to her father to awake had the presence
 mind to present it at the intruder she did
so the more readily because she imagined she
recognized in the visage which she partially saw
the features the woman whom she had met
with at rosamond's well and which had appeared
to her peculiarly harsh and suspicious her
father at the same time seized his sword and came
forward while the person at the window alarmed
at these demonstrations and endeavouring to
descend missed footing as had cavahero wilts
woodstock
drake before her and went down to the earth
with no small noise nor was the reception on
the bosom our common mother either soft or
safe for by a most terrific bark and growl they
heard that bevis had come up and seized on the
party ere he or she could gain their feet
hold fast but worry not said the old
knight alice thou art the queen wenches 
stand fast here till i run down and secure the
rascal
for god's sake no my dearest father 
alice exclaimed joceline will be up immediately
 hark i hear him
there was indeed a bustle below and more
than one light danced to and fro in confusion
while those who bore them called to each other
yet suppressing their voices as they spoke as
men who would only be heard by those they addressed
the individual who had fallen under
the power bevis was most impatient in his situation
and called with least precaution here
lee forester take the dog off else i must
shoot him
 if thou dost said sir henry from the win
woodstock 
dow i blow thy brains out on the spot thieves
jocehne thieves come up and secure this ruffian
 bevis hold on 
back bevis down sir cried joceline 
i am coming i am coming sir henry saint
michael i shall go distracted 
a terrible thought suddenly occurred to alice
could joceline have become unfaithful that
he was calling bevis off the villain instead encouraging
the trusty dog to secure him her
father meantime moved perhaps by some suspicion
 the same kind hastily stepped aside out
 the moonlight and pulled alice close to him
so as to be invisible from without yet so placed
as to hear what should pass the scuffle between
bevis and his prisoner seemed to be ended by
jocelines interference and there was close whispering
for an instant as people in consultation
 all is quiet now said one voice i will
up and prepare the way for you and immediately
a form presented itself on the outside
 the window pushed open the lattice and
sprung into the parlour but almost ere his step
was upon the floor certainly before he had pb
 woodstock
gained any secure footing the old knight who
stood ready with his rapier drawn made a desperate
pass which bore the intruder to the ground
eocene who clambered up next with a dark
lantern in his hand uttered a dreadful exclamation
when he saw what had happened crying
out lord in heaven he has slain his own son 
no no i tell you no said the fallen young
man who was indeed young albert lee the only
son the old knight i am not hurt no
noise on your lives get lights instantly at
the same time he started from the floor as quickly
as he could under the embarrassment a cloak
and doublet skewered as it were together by the
rapier the old knight whose pass most fortunately
had been diverted from the body 
albert by the interruption his cloak the blade
passing right across his back piercing the clothes
while the hilt coming against his side with the
whole force the lounge had borne him to the
ground
joceline all the while enjoined silence to everyone
under the strictest conjurations silence
as you would live long on earth silence as you
woodstock 
would have a place in heaven be but silent fora
few minutes all our lives depend on it
meantime he procured lights with inexpressible
dispatch and they then beheld that sir henry
on hearing the fatal words had sunk back on
one the large chairs without either motion
colour or sign life
oh brother how could you come in this
manlier said alice
ask no questions good god for what am
i reserved he gazed on his father as he spoke
who with claycold features rigidly fixed and
his arms extended in the most absolute helplessness
looked rather the image death upon a
monument than a being in whom existence was
only suspended was my life spared said
albert raising his hands with a wild gesture to
heaven only to witness such a sight as this 
we suffer what heaven permits young man
we endure our lives while heaven continues
them let me approach the same clergyman
who had read the prayers at joceline's hut now
came forward get water he said instantly
and the helpful hand and light foot 
 woodstock
alice with the readywitted tenderness which
never stagnates in vain lamentations while there
is any room for hope provided with incredible
celerity all that the clergyman called for
it is but a swoon he said on feeling sir
henry's palm a swoon produced from the
instant and unexpected shock rouse thee up
albert i promise thee it will be nothing save a
syncope a cup my dearest alice and a ribbon
or a bandage i must take some blood 
some aromatics too if they can be had my good
alice
but while alice procured the cup and bandage
stripped her father's sleeve and seemed by
intuition even to anticipate every direction 
the reverend doctor her brother hearing no
word and seeing no sign comfort stood with
both hands clasped and elevated into the air a
monument speechless despair every feature
in his face seemed to express the thought here
lies my father's corpse and it is i whose rashness
has slain him 
but when a few drops blood began to follow
the lancet at first falling singly and then
woodstock 
trickling in a freer stream when in consequence
 the application cold water to the temples
and aromatics to the nostrils the old man sighed
feebly and made an effort to move his limbs
albert lee changed his posture at once to throw
himself at the feet the clergyman and kiss if
he would have permitted him his shoes and the
hem his raiment
rise foolish youth said the good man
with a reproving tone must it be always thus
with you kneel to heaven not to the feeblest
 its agents you have been saved once again
from great danger would you deserve heaven's
bounty remember you have been preserved for
other purposes than you now think on begone
you and joceline you have a duty to discharge 
and be assured it will go better with your father's
recovery that he see you not for a few minutes
down down to the wilderness and bring in
your attendant
thanks thanks a thousand thanks answered
albert lee and springing through the
lattice he disappeared as unexpectedly as be

 woodstock
had entered at the same time joceline followed
him and by the same road
alice whose fears for her father were now
something abated upon this new movement
among the persons the scene could not resist
appealing to her venerable assistant good
doctor answer me but one question was my
brother albert here just now or have i dreamed
all that has happened for these ten minutes past
methinks but for your presence i could suppose
the whole had passed in my sleep that
horrible thrust that deathlike corpselike old
man that soldier in mute despair i must indeed
have dreamed
 if you have dreamed my sweet alice said
the doctor i wish every sick nurse had your
property since you have been attending to our
patient better during your sleep than most 
these old dormice can do when they are most
awake but your dream came through the gate
 horn my pretty darling which you must remind
me to explain to you at leisure albert has
really been here and will be here again
woodstock 
albert repeated sir henry who names
my son 
it is i my kind patron said the doctor 
permit me to bind up your arm
my wound with all my heart doctor
said sir henry raising himself and gathering his
recollection by degrees i knew old thou
wert bodycurer as well as soulcurer and served
my regiment for surgeon as well as chaplain
but where is the rascal i killed i never made
a fairer stramaon in my life the shell my
rapier struck against his ribs so dead he must
be or my right hand has forgot its cunning
 nobody was slain said the doctor we
must thank god for that since there were none
but friends to slay here is a good cloak and doublet
though wounded in a fashion which will require
some skill in tailorcraft to cure but i was
your last antagonist and took a little blood from
you merely to prepare you for the pleasure and
surprise seeing your son who though hunted
pretty close as you may believe hath made his
way from worcester hither wherewith jocehne's
assistance we will care well enough for his safe
 woodstock
ty it was even for this reason that i pressed
you to accept your nephew's proposal to return
to the old lodge where a hundred men
might be concealed though a thousand were
making search to discover them never such a
place for hideandseek as i shall make good
when i can find means to publish my wonders
 woodstock
but my son my dear son said the knight
shall i not then instantly see him and wherefore
did you not forewarn me this joyful
event 
because i was uncertain his motions
said the doctor and rather thought he was
bound for the seaside and that it would be best
to tell you his fate when he was safe on board
and in full sail for france we had appointed
to let you know all when i came hither tonight
to join you but there is a redcoat in the house
whom we care not to trust farther than we could
not help we dared not therefore venture in by
the hall and so prowling round the building
albert informed us that an old prank his
when a boy consisted entering by this wui
woodstock 
dow a lad who was with us would needs make
the experiment as there seemed to be no light in
the chamber and the moonlight without made us
liable to be detected his foot slipped and our
friend bevis came upon us
in good truth you acted simply said sir
henry to attack a garrison without a summons
but all this is nothing to my son albert where
is he let me see him
but sir henry wait said the doctor till
your restored strength 
a plague my restored strength man 
answered the knight as his old spirit began to
awaken within him dost not remember that
i lay on edgehillfield all night bleeding like a
bullock from five several wounds and wore my
armour within six weeks and you talk to me 
the few drops blood that follow such a scratch
as a cat's claw might have made 
nay if you feel so courageous said the
doctor i will fetch your son he is not far distant

so saying he left the apartment making a sign
to alice to remain in case any symptoms her
father's weakness should return
vol n
 woodstock
it was fortunate perhaps that sir henry never
seemed to recollect the precise nature the
alarm which had at once and effectually as the
shock the thunderbolt for the moment suspended
his faculties something he said more
than once being certain he had done mischief
with that stramafon as he called it but his mind
did not recur to that danger as having been incurred
by his son alice glad to see that her
father appeared to have forgotten a circumstance
so fearful as men often forget the blow or other
sudden cause which has thrown them into a
swoon readily excused herself from giving much
light on the matter by pleading the general confusion
and in a few minutes albert cut off all
farther inquiry by entering the room followed
by the doctor and throwing himself alternately
into the arms his father and his sister
woodstock 
chapter viii
the boy is hark ye sirrah what's your name 
oh jacob ay i recollect the same
crabbe
the affectionate relatives were united as those
who meeting under great adversity feel still the
happiness sharing it in common they embraced
again and again and gave way to those expansions
 the heart which at once express and
relieve the pressure mental agitation at length
the tide emotion began to subside and sir
henry still holding his recovered son by the hand
resumed the command his feelings which he
usually practised
so you have seen the last our battles
albert he said and the king's colours have
fallen for ever before the rebels 
it is but even so said the young man 
the last cast the die was thrown and alas 
 woodstock
lost at worcester and cromweirs fortune carried
it there as it has wherever he has shown himself
 well it can but be for a time it can but
be for a time answered his father the devil
is potent they say in raising and gratifying favourites
but he can grant but short leases and
the king the king albert the king in my
ear close close 
our last news were confident that he had
escaped from bristol
thank god for that thank god for that 
said the knight where didst thou leave him p
our jan were almost all cut to pieces at the
bridge albert replied but i followed his majesty
with about five hundred other officers and
gentlemen who were resolved to die around him
until as our numbers and appearance drew the
whole pursuit after us it pleased his majesty to
dismiss us with many thanks and words comfort
to us in general and some kind expressions
to most us in especial he sent his royal greeting
to you sir in particular and said more than
becomes me to repeat
nay i will hear it every word boy said
woodstock 
sir henry is not the certainty that thou hast
discharged thy duty and that king charles owns
it enough to console me for all we have lost and
suffered and wouwst thou stint me it from a
false shamefacedness i will have it out thee
were it drawn from thee with cords 
it shall need no such compulsion said the
young man it was his majesty's pleasure to
bid me tell sir henry lee in his name that
if his son could not go before his father in the
race loyalty he was at least following him
closely and would soon move side by side
said he so answered the knight old
victor lee will look down with pride on thee
albert but i forget you must be weary and
hungry
even so sir said albert but these are
things which late i have been in the habit 
enduring for safety's sake
joceline what ho joccline 
the underkeeper entered and received orders
to get supper prepared directly
my son and dr rochccliffe are half starving
said the knight
and there is a lad too below said joce
 woodstock
line a page he says colonel albert's whose
belly rings cupboard too and that to no common
tune for i think he could eat a horse as the
yorksmireman says behind the saddle he had
better eat at the sideboard for he has devoured
a whole loaf bread and butter as fast as
phoebe could cut it and it has not staid his stomach
for a minute and truly i think you had
better keep him under your own eyes for the
steward beneath might ask him troublesome questions
if he went below and then he is impatient
as all your gentlemen pages are and is saucy
among the women 
whom is it he talks what page hast
thou got albert that bears himself so ill said
sir henry
the son a dear friend a noble lord 
scotland who followed the great montrose's banner
 afterwards joined the king in scotland and
came with him as far as worcester he was
wounded the day before the battle and conjured
me to take this youth under my charge which i
did something unwillingly but i could not refuse
a father perhaps on his deathbed pleading
for the safety an only son
woodstock 
thou hadst deserved an halter hadst thou
hesitated said sir henry the smallest tree
can always give some shelter and it pleases me
to think the old stock lee is not so totally prostrate
but it may yet be a refuge for the distressed
fetch the youth in he is noble blood
and these are no times ceremony he shall sit
with us at the same table page though he be 
and if you have not schooled him handsomely in
his manners he may not be the worse some lessons
fi'om me
you will excuse his national drawling accent
sir said albert though i know you like it not
i have small cause albert answered the
knight small cause who stirred up these
disunion the scots who strengthened the
hands parliament when their cause was well
nigh ruined the scots again who delivered
up the king their countryman who had flung
himself upon their protection the scots again
but this lad's father you say has fought on the
part the noble montrose and such a man as
the great marquis may make amends for the degeneracy
 a whole nation
 woodstock
i
nay father said albert and i must add
that though this lad is uncouth and wayward
and as you will see something wilful yet the
king has not a more zealous friend in england 
and when occasion offered he fought stoutly too
in his defence i marvel he comes not
he hath taken the bath said joceline and
nothing less would serve than that he should have
it immediately the supper he said might be got
ready in the meantime and he commands all
about him as if he were in his father's old castle
where he might have called long enough i warrant
without any one to hear him
indeed said sir henry this must be a
forward chick the game to crow so early 
what is his name 
his name it escapes me every hour it is
so hard a one said albert kerneguy is his
name louis kerneguy his father was lord
killstewers kincardineshire
kerneguy and killstewers and kin what
d'ye call it truly said the knight these
northern men's names and titles smack their
origin they sordid like a northwest wind rumbling
and roaring among heather and rocks
woodstock 
it is but the asperities the celtic and
saxon dialects said dr rochecliffe which
according to verstegan still linger in those northern
parts the island but peace here comes
supper and master louis kerneguy
supper entered accordingly borne in by joce
line and phoebe and after it leaning on a huge
knotty stick and having his nose in the air like
a questing hound for his attention was apparently
more fixed on the good provisions that
went before him than anything else came master
kerneguy and seated himself without much
ceremony at the lower the table
he was a tall rawboned lad with a shock
head hair fiery red like many his country
while the harshness his national features was
increased by the contrast his complexion turned
almost black by the exposure to all sorts 
weather which in that skulking and rambling
mode life the fugitive royalists had been obliged
to encounter his address was by no means prepossessing
being a mixture awkwardness and
forwardness and showing in a remarkable degree
how a want easy address may be consistent with
an admirable stock assurance his face inti
wi woodstock
mated having received some recent scratches
and the care dr rochecliffe had decorated it
with a number patches which even enhanced
its natural plainness yet the eyes were brilliant
and expressive and amid his ugliness for it
amounted to that degree irregularity the face
vas not deficient in some lines which expressed
both sagacity and resolution
the dress albert himself was far beneath his
quality as the son sir henry lee and commander
 a regiment in the royal service but
that his page was still more dilapidated a
disastrous green jerkin which had been changed
to a hundred hues by sun and rain so that the
original could scarce be discovered huge clouterly
shoes leathern breeches such as were worn by
hedgers coarse grey worsted stockings were the
attire the honourable youth whose limping gait
while it added to the ungainliness his manner
showed at the same time the extent his sufferings
his appearance bordered so much upon
what is vulgarly called the queer that even with
alice it would have excited some sense ridiculehad
not compassion been predominant
the grace was said and the young squire 
ditchley as well as dr rochecliffe made an excellent
figure at a meal the like which in quality
and abundance did not seem to have lately
fallen to their share but their feats were child'splay
to those the scotch youth far from betraying
any symptoms the bread and butter with
which he had attempted to close the orifice his
stomach his appetite appeared to have been sharpened
by a nine days fast and the knight was
disposed to think that the very genius famine
himself come forth from his native regions the
north was in the act honouring him with a
visit while as if afraid losing a moment's exertion
master kerneguy never looked either to right
or left or spoke a single word to any at table
i am glad to see that you have brought a
good appetite for our country fare young gentleman
said sir henry
bread gude sir said the page an
ye'll find flesh i've find appetite conforming ony
day o the year but the truth is sir that the
appcteesement has been coming on for three days
or four and the meat in this southland your
 woodstock
has been scarce and hard to come by so sir
i'm making up for lost time as the piper sago
said when he eat a hail side o mutton
you have been countrybred young man
said the knight who like others his time held
the reins discipline rather tight over the rising
generation at least to judge from the youths
 scotland whom i have seen at his late majesty's
court in former days they had less appetite
and more more as he sought the qualifying
phrase which might supply the place good
manners his guest closed the sentence in his
own way and more meat it may be the
better luck theirs
sir henry stared and was silent his son seemed
to think it time to interpose my dear father
he said think how many years have run
since the thirtyeight when the scottish troubles
first began and i am sure that you will not
wonder that while the barons scotland have
been for one cause or other perpetually in the
field the education their children at home must
have been much neglected and that young men
 my friend's age know better about using a
woodstock soc
broadsword or tossing a pike than about the decent
ceremonials society
the reason is a sufficient one said the
knight and since thou mayest thy follower
vertigo can fight well not let him lack victuals
a god's name see he looks angrily still at
yonder cold loin mutton for god's sake put
it all on his plate 
i can bide the bit and the buffet said the
honourable master kerneguy a hungry tyke
ne'er minds a blaud with a rough bane
now god ha mercy albert but if this bethe
son a scots peer said sir henry to his
son in a low tone voice i would not bethe
english ploughman who would change manners
with him for his ancient blood and his nobility
and his estate to boot an he has one he
has eaten as i am a christian near four pounds
 solid butcher's meat and with the grace a
wolf tugging at the carcase a dead horse oh
he is about to drink at last soh he wipes his
mouth though and dips his fingers in the ewer
and dries them i profess with the napkin 
there is some grace in him after all
dog woodstock
 here is passing all your vara gude healths 
said the youth quality and took a draught in
proportion to the sods which he had sent before
 he then flung his knife and fork awkwardly
on the trencher which he pushed back towards
the centre the table extended his feet beneath
it till they rested on their heels folded his arms on
his wellreplenished stomach and lolling back in
his chair looked much as if he was about to whistle
himself asleep
 soh said the knight the honourable
master vertigo hath laid down his arms withdraw
these things and give us our glasses fill
them around jocehne and if the devil or the
whole parliament were within hearing let them
hear henry lee ditchley drink a health to
kmg charles and confusion to his enemies 
 amen said a voice from behind the door
all the company looked at each other in astonishment
at a response so little expected it was
followed by a solemn and peculiar tap such as a
kind freemasonry had introduced among royalists
and by which they were accustomed to make
woodstock 
themselves and their principles known to each other
when they met by accident
there is no danger said albert knowing
the sign it is a friend yet i wish he had been
at a greater distance just now
and why my son should you wish the absence
 one true man who may perhaps wish
to share our abundance on one those rare occasions
when we have superfluity at our disposal
 go joceline see who knocks and if a
safe man admit him
 and if otherwise said joceline methinks
i shall be able to prevent his troubling the good
company
no violence joceline on your life said
albert lee and alice echoed for god's sake
no violence 
no unnecessary violence at least said the
good knight for if the time demands it i will
have it seen that i am master my own house
joceline jolift'e nodded assent to all parties and
went on tiptoe to exchange one or two other mysterious
symbols and knocks ere he opened the
door it may be here remarked that this species
sos woodstock
 secret association with its signals union existed
among the more dissolute and desperate class
 cavaliers men habituated to the dissipated life
which they had been accustomed to in an illdisciplined
army where everything like order and
regularity was too apt to be accounted a badge 
puritanism these were the roaring boys who
met in hedge alehouses and when they had by
any chance obtained a little money or a little
credit determined to create a counterrevolution
by declaring their sittings permanent and proclaimed
in the words one their choicest ditties

we'll drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
the leaders and gentry a higher description
and more regular morals did not indeed partake
such excesses but they still kept their eye upon
a class persons who from courage and desperation
were capable serving on an advantageous
occasion the fallen cause royalty and recorded
the lodges and blindtaverns at which
they met as wholesale merchants know the houses
 call the mechanics whom they may have
occasion to employ and can tell where they may
woodstock j
i
lind them when need requires it is scarce necessary
to add that among the lower class and
sometimes even among the higher there were men
found capable betraying the projects and conspiracies
 their associates whether well or indifferently
combined to the governors the state
cromwell in particular had gained some correspondents
 this kind the highest rank and
 the most undoubted character among the royalists
who if they made scruple impeaching
or betraying individuals who confided in them
had no hesitation in giving the government such
general information as served to enable him to disappoint
the purposes any plot or conspiracy
to return to our story in much shorter time
than we have spent in reminding the reader 
these historical particulars joliffe had made his
mystic communication and being duly answered
as by one the initiated he undid the door and
there entered our old friend roger wildrake
roundhead in dress as his safety and his dependence
on colonel everard compelled him to
be but that dress worn in a most cavalierlike
manner and forming a stronger contrast than
vol o
 woodstock
usual with the demeanour and language the
wearer to which it was never very congenial
his puritanic hat the emblem that ralph
in the prints to hudibras or as he called it
his feltumbrella was set most knowingly on one
side the head as if it had been a spanish hat
and feather his straight squarecaped sadcoloured
cloak was flung gaily upon one shoulder
as if it had been threepiled tafteta lined with
crimson silk and he paraded his huge calfskin
boots as if they had been silken hose and spanish
leather shoes with roses on the instep in short
the airs which he gave himself a most thoroughpaced
wild gallant and cavalier joined to a glistening
 selfsatisfaction in his eye and an inimitable
swagger in his gait which completely announced
his thoughtless conceited and reckless
character formed a most ridiculous contrast to his
gravity attire
it could not on the other hand be denied that
in spite the touch ridicule which attached to
his character and the loose morality which he
had learned in the dissipation town pleasures
and afterwards in the disorderly life a soldier
wildrake had points about him both to make him
woodstock 
feared and respected he was handsome even in
spite his air debauched effrontery a man
 the most decided courage though his vaunting
rendered it sometimes doubtful and entertained
a sincere sense his political principles such as
they were though he was often so imprudent in
asserting and boasting them as joined with
this dependence on colonel everard induced prudent
men to doubt his sincerity
such as he was however he entered the parlour
 victor lee where his presence was anything
but desirable to the parties present with
a jaunty step and a consciousness deserving
the best possible reception this assurance was
greatly aided by circumstances which rendered it
obvious that if the jocund cavalier had limited
himself to one draught liquor that evening in
terms his vow temperance it must have been
a very deep and long one
save ye gentlemen save ye save you good
sir henry lee though i have scarce the honour
to be known to you save you worthy doctor
and a speedy resurrection to the fallen church 
england's
you are welcome sir said sir henry time
 woodstock
whose feelings hospitality and the fraternal
reception due to a royalist sufferer induced him
to tolerate this intrusion more than he might have
done otherwise if you have fought or suffered
for the king sir it is an excuse for joining us
and commanding our services in anything in our
power although at present we are a family party
but i think i saw you in waiting upon master
markham everard who calls himself colonel
everard if your message is from him you may
wish to see me in private 
not at all sir henry not at all it is true
as my ill hap will have it that being on the stormy
side the hedge like all honest men you understand
me sir henry i am glad as it were to
gain something from my old friend and comrade's
countenance not by truckling or disowning my
principles sir i defy such practices but in
short by doing him any kindness in rrty power
when he is pleased to call on me so i came down
here with a message from him to the old roundheaded
son a i beg the young lady's pardon
from the crown her head down to the very
toes her slipper and so sir chancing as i
was stumbling out in the dark i heard you give
woodstock s
a toast sir which warmed my heart sir and ever
will sir till death chills it and so i made bold
to let you know there was an honest man within
hearing
such was the selfintroduction master drake
to which the knight replied by asking him to
sit down and take a glass sack to his majesty's
glorious restoration wildrake at this hint squeezed
in without ceremony beside the young scotchman
and not only pledged his landlord's toast
but seconded its import by volunteering a verse
or two his favourite loyal ditty the king
shall enjoy his own again the heartiness which
he threw into his song opened still farther the
heart the old knight though albert and alice
looked at each other with looks resentful the
intrusion and desirous to put an to it the
honourable master kerneguy either possessed that
happy indifference temper which does not deign
to notice such circumstances or he was able to
assume the appearance it to perfection as he
sat sipping sack and cracking walnuts without
testifying the least sense that an addition had been
made to the party wildrake who liked the liquor
and the company showed no unwillingness
il woodstock
to repay this landlord by being at the expense 
the conversation
you talk fighting and suffering sir henry
lee lord help us we have all had our share
all the world knows what sir henry lee has
done from edgefield downwards wherever a loyal
sword was drawn or a loyal flag fluttered ah
god help us i have done something too my
name is roger wildrake squattleseamere 
lincoln not that you are ever like to have heard
it before but i was captain in lunsford's lighthorse
and afterwards with goring i was a
childeater sir a babe bolter
i have heard your regiment's exploits sir 
and perhaps you may find i have seen some 
them if we should spend ten minutes together 
and i think i have heard your name too i
beg to drink your health captain wildrake 
squattleseamere lincolnshire 
sir henry i drink yours in this pint bumper
and upon my knee and i would do as much
for that young gentleman looking at albert 
and the squire the green cassock too holding
it for green as the colours are not to my eyes altogether
clear and distinguishable
woodstock 
it was a remarkable part what is culled by
theatrical folks the byplay this scene that
albert was conversing apart with doctor rochecliffs
in whispers even more than the divine seemed
desirous encouraging yet to whatever their
private conversation referred it did not deprive
the young colonel from the power listening to
what was going forward in the party at large and
interfering from time to time like a watchdog
who can distinguish the slightest alarm even when
employed in the engrossing process taking his
food
captain wildrake said albert we have
no objection i mean my friend and i to be
communicative on proper occasions but you sir
who are so old a sufferer must needs know that
at such casual meetings as this men do not mention
their names unless they are specially wanted
it is a point conscience sir to be able to say
if your principal captain everard or colonel
everard if he be a colonel should examine you
upon oath i did not know who the persons were
whom i heard drink such and such toasts
faith i have a better way it worthy sir
answered wildrake i never can for the life
 woodstock
 me remember that there were any such and
such toasts drunk at all its a strange swift forgetfulness
i have
well sh replied the younger lee but
we who have unhappily more tenacious memories
would willingly abide by the more general rule
oh sir answered wildrake with all my
heart intrude on no man's confidence d n me
and i only spoke for civility's sake having the
purpose drinking your health in a good fashion
then he broke forth into melody 
then let the health go round around around around
then let the health go round 
for though your stocking be ilk
your knee shall kiss the ground aground aground aground
your knee shall kiss the ground 
urge it no farther said sir henry addressing
his son master wildrake is one the old
school one the tantivy boys and we must
bear a little for if they drmk hard they fought
well i will never forget how a party came up
and rescued us clerks oxford as they called
the regiment i belonged to out a cursed embroglie
during the attack on brentford i tell you
we were enclosed with the cockneys pikes both
li'ont and rear and we should have come off but
woodstock 
ill had not lunsford's light horse the babceatcrs
as they called them charged up to the pike's
point and brought us off
i am glad you thought on that sir henry
said wildrake and do you remember what the
officer lunsford's said 
i think i do said sir henry smiling
well then did not he call out when the women
were coming down howling like syrens as
they were have none you a plump child that
you could give us to break our fast upon t 
truth itself said the knight and a great
fat woman stepped forward with a baby and offered
it to the supposed cannibal
all at the table master kerneguy excepted
who seemed to think that good food any kind
required no apology held up their hands in token
 amazement
ay said wildrake the ahem i
crave the lady's pardon again from tip topknot
to hem farthingale but the cursed creature
proved to be a parish nurse who had been paid
for the child half a year in advance gad i took
the baby out the bitchwolf's hand and i have
contrived though god knows i have lived in a
s
woodstock
sheltering sort way myself to breed up bold
breakfast as i call him ever since it was paying
dear for a jest though
sir i honour you for your humanity sir
i thank you for your courage sir i am glad to
see you here said the good knight his eyes watering
almost to overflowing so you were the
wild officer who cut us out the toils oh sir
had you but stopped when i called on you and allowed
us to clear the streets brentford with our
musketeers we would have been at london stone
that day but your good will was the same
ay truly was it said wildrake who now sat
triumphant and glorious in his easychair and
here is to all the brave hearts sir that fought and
fell in that same storm brentford we drove
all before us like chaff till the shops where they
sold strong waters and other temptations brought
us up gad sir we the babeeaters had too many
acquaintances in brentford and our stout prince
rupert was ever better at making way than drawing
off gad sir for my own poor share i did
but go into the house a poor widow lady who
maintained a charge daughters and whom i had
known old to get my horse fed a morsel 
woodstock 
meat and so forth when these cockneypikes 
the artillery ground as you very well call them
rallied and came in with their armed heads as
boldly as so many cotswold rams i sprang downstairs
 got to my horse but egad i fancy all my
troop had widows and orphan maidens to comfort
as well as i for only five us got together we
cut our way through successfully and gad gentlemen
i carried my little breakfast on the pommel
before me and there was such a hollowing
and screeching as if the whole town thought i
was to kill roast and eat the poor child so soon
as i got to quarters but devil a cockney charged
up to my bonny bay poor lass to rescue little
cakebread they only cried haro and out upon
me
alas alas said the knight we made
ourselves seem worse than we were and we were
too bad to deserve god's blessing even in a good
cause but it is needless to look back we did
not deserve victories when god gave them for
we never improved them like good soldiers or
like christian men and so we gave these canting
scoundrels the advantage us for they assumed
out mere hypocrisy the discipline and orderly
 woodstock
behaviour which we who drew our swords in a
better cause ought to have practised out true
principle but here is my hand captain i have
often wished to see the honest fellow who charged
up so smartly in our behalf and i reverence you
for the care you took the poor child i am glad
this dilapidated place has still some hospitality to
offer you although we cannot treat you to roasted
babes or stewed sucklings eh captain
troth sir henry the scandal was sore against
us on that score i remember lacy who was an
old playactor and a lieutenant in ours made
drollery on it in a play which was sometimes
acted at oxford when our hearts were something
up called i think the old troop
this curious old play may be consulted by the dramatic
antiquary a scene or two it turns on the strange impression
made on the country people that the cavaliers actually eat children
it was written by lacy a player who had served in this
same old troop which lay under such evil reputation miss
edgeworth has quoted a verse a popular poem referring to the
same prejudice 
the pest that came from coventry
riding in a red rochet
had news to tell how lunsford fell
a child's hand in his pocket
it was not a small cause the violent prejudices the citizen
woodstock 
so saying and feeling more familiar as his merits
were known he hitched his chair up against
that the scottish lad who was seated next him
and who in shifting his place was awkward
enough to disturb in his turn alice lee who
sate opposite and a little offended or at least
embarrassed drew her chair away from the table
 i crave pardon said the honourable master
kerneguy but sir to master wildrake yc
hae e'en garret me hurt the young lady's shank
i crave your pardon sir and much more
that the fair lady as is reasonable though rat
me sir if it was i set your chair atrundling in
that way zooks sir i have brought with mc
no plague nor pestilence nor other infectious
disorder that ye should have started away as if
i had been a leper and discomposed the lady
which i would have prevented with my life sir
sir if ye be northern born as your tongue bespeaks
egad it was i ran the risk in drawing near
you so there was small reason for you to bolt
master wildrake said albert interfering
 london against king charles that he had attempted to put
this same liunsford thought capable such ferocious proceedings
into the government the tower london
woodstock
this young gentleman is a stranger as well as
you under protection sir henry's hospitality
and it cannot be agreeable for my father to see disputes
arise among his guests you may mistake
the young gentleman's quality from his present
appearance this is the honourable master louis
kerneguy sir son my lord listeners kincardiganshire
one who has fought for the king
young as he is
no dispute shall rise through me sir none
through me said wildrake your exposition
suffice sir master louis girnigo son my
lord kilsteer in gringardenshire i am your
humble slave sir and drink your health in token
that i honour you and all true scots who draw
their andrew ferrara on the right side sir
ise beholden to you and thank you sir
said the young man with some haughtiness 
manner which hardly corresponded with his rusticity
 and i fuss your health in a ceevil way
most judicious persons would have here dropped
the conversation but it was one wildrake's
marked peculiarities that he could never let matters
stand when they were well he continued to
plague the shy proud and awkward lad with his
woodstock 
observations you speak sour national dialect
pretty strongly master girnigo said he but
i think not quite the language the gallants
that i have known among the scottish cavaliers
i knew for example some the gordon
and others good repute who always put an
for the wh asjaat for what jan for zahen and
the like
albert lee here interposed and said that the
provinces scotland like those england had
their different modes pronunciation
you are very right sir said wildrake
i reckon myself now a pretty good speaker 
their cursed jargon no offence young gentleman
 and yet when i took a turn with some 
montrose's folks in the south hieland as they
call their beastly wildernesses no offence again
i chanced to be by myself and to lose my way
when i said to a shepherdfellow making my
mouth as wide and my voice as broad as i could
shore am i ganging till confound me if the
fellow could answer me unless indeed he was
sulky as the bumpkins will be now and then to
the gentlemen the sword
this was familiarly spoken and though partly
s woods rocif
addressed to albert was stili more directed to his
immediate neighbour the young scotsman who
seemed from bashfulness or some other reason
rather shy his intimacy to one or two personal
touches from wildrake's elbow administered
during his last speech by way a practical
appeal to him in particular he only answered
misunderstandings were to be expected when
men converse in national dialects
wildrake now considerably drunker than he
ought to have been in civil company caught up
the phrase and repeated it misunderstanding
sir misunderstanding sir i do not know
how i came to construe that sir but to judge
from the information these scratches on your
honourable visnomy i should augur that you
had been late at misunderstanding with the
cat sir
you are mistaken then friend for it was
with the down answered the scotsman drily
and cast a look towards albert
we had some trouble with the watch dogs in
entering so late in the evening said albert in explanation
 and this youth had a fall among some
rubbish by which he came by these scratches 
woodstock 
and now dear sir henry said dr jlochecliffe
 allow us to remind you your gout and our
long journey i do it the rather that my good
friend your son has been during the whole time
 supper putting questions to me aside which
had much better be reserved till tomorrow may
we therefore ask permission to retire to our night's
rest 
 these private committees in a merry meeting

henry pleased at discovering a new good quality
in his acquaintance whose military services were
otherwise but just able to counterbalance the
intrusive freedom his conversation in the
name merry will he continued whom i
never saw though i have seen many his comrades

the song and the parts which each was to bear
they united their voices in trolling a loyal glee
which was popular among the party at the time
and in fact believed to be composed by no less a
person than doctor rochecliffe himself
glee f or king charles
bring the bowl which you boast
fill it up to the brim 
tis to him we love most
and to all who love him
brave gallants stand up
and ay aunt ye base charles 
were there death in the cup
here's a health to king charles 
though he wanders through dangers
unaided unknown
dependent on strangers
estranged from his own 
though tis under our breath
amidst forfeits and perils
here's to honour and faith
and a health to king charles 
let such honours abound
as the time can afford
the knee on the ground
and the hand on the sword 
but the time shall come round
when mid lords dukes and earls
the loud trumpets shall sound
here's a health to king charles 
woodstock 
after this display loyalty and a final libation
the party took leave each other for the night
sir henry offered his old acquaintance wildrake
a bed for the evening who weighed the matter
somewhat in this fashion why to speak truth
my patron will expect me at the borough but then
he is used to my staying out doors a nights
then there's the devil that they say haunts woodstock
 but with the blessing this reverend doctor
i defy him and all his works i saw him not
when i slept here twice before and i am sure if
he was absent then he has not come back with sir
henry lee and his family so i accept your courtesy
sir henry and i thank you as a cavalier 
lunsford should thank one the fighting clerks
 oxon god bless the king i care not who
hears it and confusion to noll and his red nose 
off he went accordingly with a bottleswagger
guided by joceline to whom albert in the meantime
had whispered to be sure to quarter him
far enough from the rest the family
young lee then saluted his sister and with
the formality those times asked and received
lois father's blessing with an affectionate embrace
his page seemed desirous to imitate one part 
 woodstock
his example but was repelled by alice who only
replied to his offered salute with a curtsey he
next bowed his head in an awkward fashion to her
father who wished him a good night i am glad
to see young man he said that you have at
least learned the reverence due to age it should
always be paid sir because in doing so you render
that honour to others which you will expect yourself
to receive when you approach the close 
your life more will i speak with you at leisure
on your duties as a page which office in former days
used to be the very school chivalry whereas 
late by the disorderly times it has become little
better than a school wild and disordered license 
which made rare ben jonson exclaim 
 nay father said albert interposing you
must consider this day's fatigue and the poor lad
is almost asleep on his legs tomorrow he will
listen with more profit to your kind admonitions
and you louis remember at least one part 
your duty take the candles and light us here
joccline comes to show us the may once more
good night ijood doctor rochcclifie good night

kbiff richard thanks noble peer i

richard 
albert and his page were ushered by joce
line to what was called the spanish chamber
a huge old scrambling bedroom rather in a dilapidated
condition but furnished with a large
standing bed for the master and a trucklebed
for the domestic as was common at a much later
period in old english houses where the gentleman
often required the assistance a groom 
the chambers to help him to bed if the hospitality
had been exuberant the walls were covered
with hangings cordovan leather stamped
with gold and representing fights between the
 woodstock
spaniards and moriscoes bullfeasts and other
sports peculiar to the peninsula from which it
took its name the spanish chamber these
hangings were in some places entirely torn down
in others defaced and hanging in tatters but
albert stopped not to make observations anxious
it seemed to get joceline out the room which
he achieved by hastily answering his offers fresh
fuel and more liquor in the negative and returning
with equal conciseness the underkeeper's
good wishes for the evening he at length retired
somewhat unwillingly and as if he thought
that his young master might have bestowed a few
more words upon a faithful old retainer after so
long absence
joliffe was no sooner gone than before a single
word was spoken between albert lee and his
page the former hastened to the door examined
lock latch and bolt and made them fast with the
most scrupulous attention he superadded to
these precautions that a long screwbolt which
he brought out his pocket and which he screwed
on to the staple in such a manner as to render
it impossible to withdraw it or open the door unwoodstock
sapless
by breaking it down the page held alight to
him during the operation which his master went
through with much exactness and dexterity but
when albert arose from his knee on which he had
rested during the accomplishment this task the
manner the companions was on the sudden entirely
changed towards each other the honourable
master kerneguy from a cubbish lout a
raw scotsman seemed to have acquired at once
all the grace and ease motion and manner
which could be given by an acquaintance the
earliest and most familiar kind with the best company
 the time
he gave the light he held to albert with the
easy indifference a superior who rather graces
than troubles his dependent by giving him some
slight service to perform albert with the greatest
appearance deference assumed in his turn
the character torchbearer and lighted his page
across the chamber without turning his back upon
him as he did so he then set the light on a table
by the bedside and approaching the young man
with deep reverence received from him the soiled
green jacket with the same profound respect as
 woodstock
if he had been a first lord the bedchamber
or other officer the household the highest
distinction disrobing his sovereign the mantle
 the garter the person to whom this ceremony
was addressed endured it for a minute or
two with profound gravity and then bursting out
alaughing exclaimed to albert what a devil
means all this formality thou compliments
with these miserable rags as if they were silks
and sables and with poor louis kerneguy as if
he were the king great britain 
and if your majesty's commands and the
circumstances the time have made me for a moment
seem to forget that you are my sovereign
surely i may be permitted to render my homage
as such while you are in your own royal palace 
woodstock
truly replied the disguised monarch the
sovereign and the palace are not ill matched 
these tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suit
each other admirably this woodstock this
the bower where the royal norman revelled with
the fair rosamond clifford why it is a place
cf assignation for owls then suddenly recollectwoodstock

ing himself with his natural courtesy he added
as if fearing he might have hurt albert's feelings
but the more obscure and retired it is the
fitter for our purpose lee and if it does seem to
be a roost for owls as there is no denying why
we know it has nevertheless brought up eagles
he threw himself as he spoke upon a chair and
indolently but gracefully received the kind offices
 albert who undid the coarse buttoning his
leathern gashes which defended his legs and
spoke to him the whilst what a fine specimen
 the olden time is your father sir henry it is
strange i should not have seen him before but
i heard my father often speak him as being
among the flower our real old english gentry
by the mode in which he began to school me i
can guess you had a tight taskmaster him albert
 i warrant you never wore hat in his presence
eh 
i never cocked it at least in his presence
please your majesty as i have seen some youngsters
do answered albert indeed if i had it
must have been a stout beaver to have saved me
from a broken head
woodstock
oh i doubt it not replied the king a
fine old gentleman but with that methinks in his
countenance that assures you he would not hate
the child in sparing the rod hark ye albert 
suppose the same glorious restoration come
round which if drinking to its arrival can hasten
it should not be far distant for in that particular
our adherents never neglect their duty suppose
it come therefore and that thy father as
must be course becomes an earl and one 
the privy council odd's fish man i shall be as
much afraid him as ever was my grandfather
henri quatre old sully imagine there were
such a trinket now about the court as the fair
rosamond or la belle gabrielle what a work
there would be pages and grooms the cham
to get the pretty rogue clandestinely shuffled
out by the backstairs like a prohibited commodity
when the step the earl woodstock was
heard in the antechamber v
i am glad to see your majesty so merry after
your fatiguing journey
the fatigue was nothing man said charles
a kind welcome and a good meal made amends
woodstock 
for all that but they must have suspected thee 
bringing a wolf from the braes badcnoch along
with you instead a twolegged being with no
more than the usual allowance mortal stowage
for provisions i was really ashamed my appetite
 but thou knowest i had eat nothing for
twentyfour hours save the raw egg you stole forme
from the old woman's henroost i tell thee i
blushed to show myself so ravenous before that
high bred and respectable old gentleman your
father and the very pretty girl your sister or
cousin is she 
she is my sister said albert lee drily and
added in the same breath your majesty's appetite
suited well enough with the character a
raw northern lad would your majesty now
please to retire to rest 
not for a minute or two said the king retaining
his seat why man i have scarce had
my tongue unchained today and to talk with
that northern twang and besides the fatigue 
being obliged to speak every word in character 
gad it's like walking as the galley slaves do on
the continent with a twentyfourpound shot
g woodstock
chained to their legs they may drag it along
but they cannot move with comfort and by the
way thou art slack in paying me my welldeserved
tribute compliments on my counterfeiting
did i not play louis kerneguy as round as a
ring
 if your majesty asks my serious opinion perhaps
i may be forgiven if i say your dialect was
somewhat too coarse for a scottish youth high
birth and your behaviour perhaps a little too
churlish i thought too though i pretend not
to be skilful that some your scotch sounded
as if it were not genuinely
not genuine there is no pleasing thee albert
 why who should speak genuine scotch
but myself was i not their king for a matter
 ten months and if i did not get knowledge
 their language i wonder what else i got by
it did not east country and south country and
west country and highlands caw croak and
shriek about me as the deep guttural the broad
drawl and the high sharp yelp predominated by
turns odd's fish man have i not been speeches
woodstock j
at by their orators addressed by their senators rebuked
by their workmen have i not sate on the
cuttlestool mon again assuming the northern
dialect and thought it grace worthy mas john
gillespie that i was permitted to do penance in
mine own privy chamber instead the face the
congregation and wilt thou tell me after all that
i cannot speak scotch enough to bare an oxon
knight and his family 
may it please your majesty i began by
saying i was no judge the scottish language
pshaw it is mere envy just so you said at
norton's that i was too courteous and civil for a
young page now you think me too rude
 and there is a medium if one could find it
said albert defending his opinion in the same
tone in which the king attacked him so this
morning when you were in the woman's dress you
raised your petticoats rather unbecomingly high
as you waded through the first little stream and
when i told you it to mend the matter you
draggled through the next without raising them
at all
o the devil take the woman's dress said
 woodstock
charles i hope i shall never be driven to that
disguise again why my ugly face was enough
to put gowns caps and kirtles out fashion for
ever the very dogs fled from me had i passed
any hamlet that had but five huts in it i could
not have escaped the cuckingstool i was a libel
on womanhood these leathern conveniences are
none the gayest but they are propria que marius
 and right glad am i to be repossessed 
them i can tell you too my friend i shall resume
all my masculine privileges with my proper
habiliments and as you say i have been too
coarse tonight i will behave myself like a courtier
to mistress alice tomorrow i made a sort
 acquaintance with her already when i seemed
to be the same sex with herself and found out
there are other colonels in the wind besides you
colonel albert lee
may it please your majesty said albert 
and then stopped short from the difficulty 
finding words to express the unpleasant nature 
his feelings they could not escape charles but
he proceeded without scruple i pique myself
on seeing as far into the hearts young ladies
woodstock 
as most folks though god knows they are sometimes
too deep for the wisest us but i mentioned
to your sister in my character fortuneteller 
thinking poor simple man that a country girl must
have no one but her brother to dream about 
that she was anxious about a certain colonel i
had hit the theme but not the person for i alluded
to you albert and i presume the blush
was too deep ever to be given to a brother so up
she got and away she flew from me like a lapwing
i can excuse her for looking at myself in the well
i think if i had met such a creature as i seemed
i should have called fire and faggot against it 
now what think you albert who can this colonel
be that more than rivals you in your sister's
affection 
albert who well knew that the king's mode 
thinking where the fair sex was concerned was
far more gay than delicate endeavoured to put a
stop to the present topic by a grave answer
his sister he said had been in some measure
educated with the son her maternal uncle
markham everard but as his father and he himself
had adopted the cause the roundheads the
 woodstock
families had in consequence been at variance and
any projects which might have been formerly entertained
were course long since dismissed on
all sides
you are wrong albert you are wrong said
the king pitilessly pursuing his jest you colonels
whether you wear blue or orange sashes
are too pretty fellows to be dismissed so easily
when once you have acquired an interest but
mistress alice so pretty and who wishes the restoration
 the king with such a look and accent
as if she were an angel whose prayers must
needs bring it down must not be allowed to retain
any thoughts a canting roundhead what
say you will you give me leave to take her to
task about it after all i am the party most
concerned in maintaining true allegiance among
tiny subjects and if i gain the pretty maidens
good will that the sweethearts will soon follow
this was jolly king edward's way edward the
fourth you know the kingmaking earl warwick
 the cromwell his day dethroned him
more than once but he had the hearts the
hi
woodstock h
merry dames london and the purses and veins
 the cockneys bled freely till they brought him
home again how say you shall i shake off my
northern slough and speak with alice in my own
character showing what education and manners
have done for me to make the best amends they
can for an ugly face 
may it please your majesty said albert in
an altered and embarrassed tone i did not expect

here he stopped not able to find words adequate
at the same time to express his sentiments
and respectful enough to the king while in this
father's house and under his own protection
and what is it that master lee does not expect
 said charles with marked gravity on his
part
again albert attempted a reply but advanced
no farther than i would hope if it please your
majesty when he again stopped short his deep
and hereditary respect for his sovereign and his
sense the hospitality due to his misfortunes
preventing his giving utterance to this irritated
feelings
vol q
 woodstock
and what does colonel albert lee hope 
said charles in the same dry and cold manner in
which he had before spoken no answer 
now hope that colonel lee does not see in a
silly jest anything offensive to the honour his
family since methinks that were an indifferent
compliment to his sister his father and himself
not to mention charles stuart whom he calls his
king and expect that i shall not be so hardly
construed as to be supposed capable forgetting
that mistress auce lee is the daughter my
faithful subject and host and the sister my
guide and preserver come come albert he
added changing at once to his naturally frank and
unceremonious manner you forget how long i
have been abroad where men women and children
talk gallantry morning noon and night
with no more serious thought than just to pass
away the time and i forget too that you are 
the oldfashioned english school a son after sir
henry's own heart and don't understand raillery
upon such subjects but i ask your pardon
albert sincerely if i have really hurt you
so saying he extended his hand to colonel lee
woodstock sii
who feeling he had been really too hasty in construing
the king's jest in an unpleasant sense kissed
it with reverence and attempted an apology
not a word not a word said the goodnatured
prince raising his penitent adherent as he
attempted to kneel we understand each other
you are somewhat afraid the gay reputation
which i acquired in scotland but i assure you i
will be as stupid as you or your cousin colonel
could desire in presence mrs alice lee and
only bestow my gallantry should i have any to
throw away upon the pretty little waitingmaid
who attended at supper unless you should have
monopolized her ear for your own benefit colonel
albert
it is monopolized sure enough though not by
me if it please your majesty but by joceline 
underkeeper whom we must not disoblige
as we have trusted him so far already and may
have occasion to repose even entire confidence in
him i half think he suspects who louis kern
may in reality be
you are an engrossing set you wooers 
woodstock said the king laughing now
 woodstock
if i had a fancy as a frenchman would not fail
to have in such a case to make pretty speeches
to the deaf old woman i saw in the kitchen as a
pisaller i dare say i should be told that tier ear
was engrossed for dr rochecliffe's sole use 
i marvel at your majesty's good spirits
said albert that after a day danger fatigue
and accidents you should feel the power amusing
yourself thus
that is to say the groom the chambers
wishes his majesty would go to sleep well one
word or two on more serious business and i have
done i have been completely directed by you
and rochecliffe i have changed my disguise
from female to male upon the instant and altered
my destination from hampshire to take shelter
here do you still hold it the wiser course 
i have great confidence in dr rochecliffe
replied albert whose acquaintance with the
scattered royalists enables him to gain the most
accurate intelligence his pride in the extent 
his correspondence and the complication his
plots and schemes for your majesty's service is indeed
the very food he lives upon but his sagacity
woodstock 
is equal to this vanity i repose besides the utmost
faith in joiiffe my father and sister i
would say nothing yet i would not without reason
extend the knowledge your majesty's person
farther than it is indispensably necessary
is it handsome in me said charles pausing
to withhold my full confidence from sir henry
lee r
your majesty heard his almost deathswoon
 last night what would agitate him most
deeply must noi be hastily communicated
true but are we safe from a visit the
redcoats they have them in woodstock as well
as in oxford said charles
dr rochecliffe says not unwisely answered
lee that it is best sitting near the fire when the
chimney smokes and that woodstock so lately in
possession the sequestrated and in the vicinity
 the soldiers will be less suspected and more
carelessly searched than more distant corners
which might seem to promise more safety besides
he added rochecliffe is in possession 
curious and important news concerning the state
 matters at woodstock highly favourable to your
woodstock
majesty's being concealed in the palace for two or
three days till shipping is provided the parliament
or usurping council state had sent
down sequestrated whom their own evil consciences
assisted perhaps by the tricks some daring
cavaliers had frightened out the lodge without
much desire to come back again then the
more formidable usurper cromwell had granted
a warrant possession to colonel everard who
had only used it for the purpose repossessing
his uncle in the lodge and who kept watch in
person at the little borough to see that sir henry
was not disturbed
what mistress alice's colonel said the
king that sounds alarming for grant that
he keeps the other fellows at bay think you not
master albert he will not have an hundred errands
aday to bring him here in person p
dr rochecuffe says answered lee the
treaty between sir henry and his nephew binds
the latter not to approach the lodge unless invited
 indeed it was not without great difficulty
and strongly arguing the good consequences it
might produce to your majesty's cause that my
woodstock ji
father could be prevailed on to occupy woodstock
at all but be assured he will be in no hurry to
send an invitation to the colonel
and be you assured that the colonel will come
without waiting for one said charles folks
cannot judge rightly where sisters are concerned
they are too familiar with the magnet to judge
 its powers attraction everard will be here
as if drawn by cartropes fetters not to talk 
promises will not hold him and then methinks
we are in some danger
i hope not said albert in the first
place i know markham is a slave to his word besides
were any chance to bring him here i think
i could pass your majesty upon him without difficulty
as louis kerneguy then although my
cousin and i have not been at one for these some
years i believe him incapable betraying your
majesty and lastly if i saw the least danger 
it i would were he ten times my mother's nephew
run my sword through his body ere he
had time to execute his purpose
there is but another question said charles
and i will release you albert you seem to
 woodstock
think yourself secure from search it may be so 
but in any other country this tale goblins
which is flying about would bring down priests
and ministers justice to examine the reality 
the stormy and mobs idle people to satisfy their
curiosity
 respecting the first sir we hope and understand
that colonel everard's influence will prevent
any immediate inquiry for the sake preserving
undisturbed the peace his uncle's family
 and as for any one coming without some sort
 authority the whole neighbours have much
love and fear my father and are besides so
horribly alarmed about the goblins woodstock
that fear will silence curiosity
on the whole then said charles the
chances safety seem to be in favour the plan
we have adopted which is all i can hope for in a
condition where absolute safety is out the question
the bishop recommended dr rochechffe as
one the most ingenious boldest and most loyal
sons the church england you albert lee
have marked your fidelity by a hundred proofs
to you and your local knowledge i submit mywoodstock

self and now prepare our arms alive i will
not be taken yet i will not believe that a son
 the king england and heir her throne
could be destined to danger in his own palace
and under the guard the loyal lees
albert lee laid pistols and swords in readiness
by the king's bed and his own and charles
after some slight apology took his place in the
large and better bed with a sigh pleasure as
from one who had not lately enjoyed such an indulgence
he bid good night to his faithful attendant
who deposited himself in his truckle and
both monarch and subject were soon fast asleep
 woodto k
chapter x
give sir nicholas throlkeld praise 
hear it good man old in days
thou tree succour and rest
to this young bird that was distress'd 
beneath thy branches he did stay 
and he was free to sport and play
when falcons were abroad for prey
wordsworth
the fugitive prince slept in spite danger
with the profound repose which youth and fatigue
inspire but the young cavalier his guide and
guardsmen a more restless night starting from
time to time and listening anxious notwithstanding
doctor rochccliffes assurances to procure yet
more particular knowledge concerning the state
 things around them than he had been yet able
to collect
he arose early after daybreak but although
he moved with as little noise as was possible the
woodstock 
slumbers the haunted prince were easily disturbed
he started up in his bed and asked if
there was any alarm
none please your majesty replied lee 
only thinking on the questions your majesty
was asking last night and the various chances
there are your majesty's safety being endangered
from unforeseen accidents i thought 
going thus early both to communicate with doctor
rochecliffe and to keep such a lookout as
befits the place where are lodged for the time the
fortunes england i fear i must request 
your majesty for your own gracious security
that you have the goodness to condescend to secure
the door with your own hand after i go out
oh talk not to majesty for heaven's sake
dear albert answered the poor king endeavouring
in vain to put a part his clothes in order
to traverse the room when a king's doublet
and hose are so ragged that he can no more find
his way into them than he could have travelled
through the forest deane without a guide good
faith there should be an majesty until it
chances to be better accommodated besides there
 woodstock
is the chance these big words bolting out at
unawares when there are ears to hear them whom
we might think dangerous
your commands shall be obeyed said lee
who had now succeeded in opening the door from
which he took his departure leaving the king
who had hustled along the floor for that purpose
with his dress woefully ill arranged to make it fast
again behind him and begging his majesty in no
case to open to any one unless he or rochecliffe
were the party who summoned him
albert then set out in quest doctor s
apartment which was only known to himself
and the faithfuljoliffe and had at different times
accommodated that steady churchman with a place
 concealment when from his bold and busy temper
which led him into the most extensive and
hazardous machinations on the king's behalf he
had been strictly sought after by the opposite party
 late the inquest after him had died entirely
away as he had prudently withdrawn himself
from the scene his intrigues since the loss 
the battle worcester he had been afloat again
and more active than ever and had by friends
woodstock 
and correspondents and especially the bishop 
been the means directing the king's flight
towards woodstock although it was not until the
very day his arrival that he could promise him
a safe reception at that ancient mansion
albert lee though he revered both the undaunted
spirit and ready resources the bustling
and undertaking churchman felt he had not been
enabled by him to answer some the king's questions
yesternight in a way so distinct as one trusted
with the king's safety ought to have done and
it was now his object to make himself personally
acquainted if possible with the various bearings
 so weighty a matter as became a man on whom 
so much the responsibility wa likely to descend
even his local knowledge was scarce adequate
to find the doctor's secret apartment had he not
traced his way after a genial flavour roasted
game through divers blind passages and up and
down certain very useless stairs through cupboards
and hatchways and so forth to a species
 sanctum sanatorium where joceline joliffe
was ministering to the good doctor a solemn
breakfast wildfowl with a cup small beer
 woodstock
stirred with a sprig rosemary which doctor
rochecliffe preferred to all strong potations beside
him sat bevis on his tail slobbering and looking
amiable moved by the rare smell the breakfast
which had quite overcome his native dignity
 disposition
the chamber in which the doctor had established
himself was a little octangular room with walls
 great thickness within which were fabricated
various issues leading in different directions and
communicating with different parts the building
around him were packages with arms and near
him one small barrel as it seemed gunpowder
 many papers in different parcels and several
keys for correspondence in cypher two or three
scrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also beside
him which albert took for plans nativity and
various models machinery in which doctor
rochecliffe was an adept there were also tools
 various kinds masks cloaks and a dark lantern
and a number other indescribable trinkets
belonging to the trade a daring plotter
in dangerous times last there was a casket
with gold and silver coin different countries
woodstock 
which was left carelessly open as if it were the
least doctor rochecliffes concern although
his habits in general announced narrow circumstances
if not actual poverty close by the divine's
plate lay a bible and prayerbook with some
proof sheets as they are technically called seemingly
fresh from the press there was also within
the reach his hand a dirk or scottish poniard
a powderhorn and a musketoon or blunderbuss
with a pair handsome pocketpistols in the
midst this miscellaneous collection the doctor
sat eating his breakfast with great appetite as
little dismayed by the various implements danger
around him as a workman is when accustomed
to the perils a gunpowder manufactory
soh young gentleman he said getting up
and extending his hand are you come to breakfast
with me in good fellowship or to spoil my
meal this morning as you did my supper last
night by asking untimely questions 
i will pick a bone with you with all my
heart said albert and if you please doctor
i would ask some questions which seem not
quite untimely
 woodstock
so saying he sat down and assisted the doctor
in giving a very satisfactory account a brace
 wild ducks and a leash teal bevis who
maintained his place with great patience and insinuation
had his share a collop which was also
placed on the wellfurnished board for like most
highbred dogs he declined eating waterfowl
come hither then albert lee said the
doctor laying down his knife and fork and plucking
the towel from his throat so soon as joceline
was withdrawn thou art still the same lad thou
wert when i was thy tutor never satisfied with
having got a grammar rule but always persecuting
me with questions why the rule stood so and not
otherwise over curious after information which
thou could'st not comprehend as bevis hungered
and whined for the duckwing which he could not
eat
i hope you will find me more reasonable
doctor answered albert and at the same
time that you will recollect i am not now stibjh
rtda but am placed in circumstances where i am
not at liberty to act upon the ipse dixit any
wooitoic 
man unless my own judgment be convinced 
shall deserve richly to be hanged drawn and
quartered should any misfortune happen by my
misgovernment in this business
and it is therefore albert that i would
have thee trust the whole to me without interfering
thou mayest forsooth thou art not sub ferula
 but recollect that while you have been fighting
in the field i have been plotting in the study
that i know all the combinations the king's
friends ay and all the motions his enemies as
well as a spider knows every mesh his web
think my experience man not a cavalier in
the land but has heard rochecliite the plotter
i have been a main limb in everything that has
been attempted since fortytwo penned declarations
conducted correspondence communicated
with chiefs recruited followers commissioned
arms levied money appointed rendezvous i was
in the western rising and before that in the
city petition and in sir john owen's stir in
wales in short almost in every plot for the king
since tomkins and challenger's matter
but were not all these plots unsuccessful 
vol r
 woodstock
gait albert and were not tomkins and challenger
hanged doctor 
yes my young friend answered the doctor
gravely as many others have been with whom
i have acted but only because they did not follow
my advice implicitly you never heard that i
was hanged myself
the time may come doctor said albert 
the pitcher goes oft to the well the proverb
as my father would say is somewhat musty but
i too have some confidence in my own judgement
 and much as i honour the church i cannot
altogether subscribe to passive obedience i
will tell you in one word what points i must have
explanation on and it will remain with you to
give it or to return a message to the king that
you will not explain your plan in which case if
he acts by my advice he will leave woodstock
and resume his purpose getting to the coast
without delay
well then thou suspicious monster make
thy demands and if they be such as i can answer
without betraying confidence i will reply to
them
woodstock 
 in the first place then what is all this story
about ghosts and witchcraft and apparitions 
and do you consider it as safe for his majesty to
stay in a house subject to such visitations real or
pretended 
you must be satisfied with my answer in verba
sacerdotal the circumstances you allude to will
not give the least annoyance to woodstock during
the king's residence i cannot explain farther
 but for this i will be bound at the risk 
my neck
then said lee we must take the doctor
for bail that the devil will keep the peace towards
our sovereign lord the king good now there
lurked about this house the greater part yesterday
and perhaps slept here a fellow called tompkins
 a bitter independent and a secretary or
something qr other to the regicide dog desborough
the man is well known a wild ranter
in religious opinions but in private affairs farsighted
cunning and interested even as any
rogue them all
be assured we will avail ourselves his crazy
fanaticism to mislead his wicked cunning s
woodstock
child may lead a hog if it has wit to fasten a cord
to the ring in its nose replied the doctor
you may be deceived said albert the
age has many such as this fellow whose views 
the spiritual and temporal world are so different
that they resemble the eyes a squinting man 
one which oblique and distorted sees nothing
but the his nose while the other instead 
partaking the same defect views strongly sharply
and acutely whatever is subjected to its scrutiny
but we will put a patch on the better eye
said the doctor and he shall only be allowed to
speculate with the imperfect optic you must
know this fellow has always seen the greatest
number and the most hideous apparitions he
has not the courage a cat in such matters
though stout enough when he hath temporal antagonists
before him i have placed him under
the charge joceline joliffe who betwixt plying
him with sack and ghoststories would make
him incapable knowing what was done if you
were to proclaim the king in his presence
but why keep such a fellow here at all 
oh sir content you he lies leaguer as a
woodstock 
sort ambassador for his worthy masters and
we are secure from any intrusion so long as they
get all the news woodstock from trusty tompkins

i know joceline's honesty well said albert 
and if he can assure me that he will keep a
watch over this fellow i will so far trust in him
he does not know the depth the stake tis
true but that my life is concerned will be quite
enough to keep him vigilant well then i proceed
 what if markham everard comes down
til
on us r
we have his word to the contrary answered
rochecliife his word honour transmitted
by his friend do you think it likely he will
break it r
i hold him incapable doing so answered
albert andbesides i think markham would
make no bad use anything which might come
to his knowledge yet god forbid we should be
under the necessity trusting any who ever wore
the parliament's colours in a matter such dear
concernment 
amen said the doctor are your doubts
silenced now 
 woodstock
i still have an objection said albert to
yonder impudent rakehelly fellow styling himself
a cavalier who pushed himself on our company
last night and gained my father's heart by
a story the storm brentford which i daresay
the rogue never saw
you mistake him dear albert roger wildrake
although till late i only knew him byname
is a gentleman was bred at the inns 
court and spent his estate in the king's service
or rather in the devil's service said albert
it is such fellows as he who sunk from the license
 their military habits into idle debauched
ruffians infest the land with riots and robberies
brawl in hedge alehouses and cellars where strong
waters are sold at midnight and with their deep
oaths their hot loyalty and their drunken valour
make decent men abominate the very name
 cavalier
alas said the doctor it is but too true 
but what can you expect when the higher and
more qualified classes are broken down and mingled
undistinguishable with the lower orders they are
apt to lose the most valuable marks their quawoodstock

city in the general confusion morals and manners
 just as a handful silver medals will become
defaced and discoloured if jumbled about
among the vulgar copper coin even the prime
medal all which we royalists would so willingly
wear next our very hearts has not perhaps entirely
escaped some deterioration but let other
tongues than mine speak on that subject
albert lee paused deeply after having heard
these communications on the part rochecliffe
 doctor he said it is generally agreed
even by some who think you may occasionally
have been a little over busy in putting men upon
dangerous actions 
may god forgive them who entertain so
false an opinion me said the doctor
that nevertheless you have done and
suffered more in the king's behalf than any man
 your function
they do me but justice there said doctor
rochecliffe absolute justice
i am therefore disposed to abide by your
opinion if all things considered you think it
safe that we should remain at woodstock
 woodstock
that is not the question answered the
divine
and what is the question then replied the
young soldier
whether any safer course can be pointed
out i grieve to say that the question must be
comparative as to the point option absolute
safety is alas the while out the question on
all sides now i say woodstock is fenced and
guarded as at present by far the most preferable
place concealment
enough i give up to you the question as
to a person whose knowledge such important
affairs not to mention your age and experience is
more intimate and extensive than mine can be
you do well answered rochecliffe and
if others had acted with the like distrust their
own knowledge and confidence in competent persons
it had been better for the age this makes
understanding bar himself up within his fortalice
and wit betake himself to his high tower here
he looked around his cell with an air selfcomplacence
 the wise man foreteeth the tempest
and lieth himsclk
woodstock 
doctor said albert let our foresight serve
others far more precious than either us let
me ask you if you have well considered whether
our precious charge should remain in society with
the family or betake himself to some the more
hidden corners the house 
hum i think he will be safest as louis
kerneguy keeping himself close beside you 
i fear it will be necessary that i scout abroad
a little and show myself in some distant part 
the country lest coming here in quest me
they should find higher game
pray do not interrupt me keeping himself
close beside you or your father in or near to
victor lee's apartment from which you are aware
he can make a ready escape should danger approach
 this occurs to me as best for the present
 i hope to hear the vessel today tomorrow
at farthest
albert lee bid the active but opinionated man
good morrow admiring how this species intrigue
had become a sort element in which the
doctor seemed to enjoy himself notwithstanding
all that the poet has said concerning the horrors
fi woodstock
which intervene betwixt the conception and execution
 a conspiracy
in returning from doctor rochecliffe's sanctuary
he met with eocene who was anxiously seeking
him the young scotch gentleman he said
in a mysterious manner has arisen from bed
and hearing me pass he called me into his apartment

well replied albert i will see him presently

and he asked me for fresh linen and clothes
now sir he is like a man who is quite accustomed
to be obeyed so i gave him a suit which happened
to be in a wardrobe in the west tower and
some your linen to conform and when he was
dressed he commanded me to show him to the
presence sir henry lee and my young lady
i would have said something sir about waiting
till you came back but he pulled me goodnaturedly
by the hair as indeed he has a rare
humour his own and told me he was guest to
master albert lee and not his prisoner so
sir though i thought you might be displeased
withme for giving him the means stirring
woodstock 
abroad and perhaps being seen by those who
should not see him what could i say 
you are a sensible fellow joceline and
comprehend always what is recommended to you
this youth will not be controlled i fear
by either us but we must look the closer
after his safety you keep your watch over that
prying fellow the steward 
trust him to my care on that side have no
fear but ah sir i would we had the young
scot in his old clothes again for the ridingsuit
 yours which he now wears hath set him off in
otherguess fashion
from the manner in which the faithful dependent
expressed himself albert saw that he suspected
who the scottish page in reality was yet
he did not think it proper to acknowledge to
him a fact such importance secure as he was
equally his fidelity whether explicitly trusted
to the full extent or left to his own conjectures
full anxious thought he went to the apartment
 victor lee in which joliife told him he
would find the party assembled the sound 
laughter as he laid his hand on the lock the
 woodstock
door almost made him start so singularly did it
jar with the doubtful and melancholy reflections
which engaged his own mind he entered and
found his father in high good humour laughing
and conversing freely with his young charge whose
appearance was indeed so much changed to the
better in externals that it seemed scarce possible
a night's rest a toilette and a suit decent
clothes could have done so much in his favour in
so short a time it could not however be imputed
to the mere alteration dress although that no
doubt had its effect there was nothing splendid
in that which louis kerneguy we continue to call
him by his assumed name now wore it was
merely a ridingsuit grey cloth with seme silver
lace in the fashion a country gentleman 
the time but it happened to fit him very welland
to become his very dark complexion especially
as he now held up his head and used the
manners not only a wellbehaved but a 
gentleman when he moved
his clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged fora
sort shuffle which as it might be the consequence
 a wound in those perilous times had
woodstock 
rather an interesting than an ungainly effect at
least it was as genteel an expression that the party
had been overheard travelled as the most polite
pedestrian could propose to himself
the features the wanderer were harsh as
ever but his red shock peruke for such it proved
was laid aside his sable elflocks were trained
by a little joceline's assistance into curls and
his fine black eyes shone from among the shade
 these curls and corresponded with the animated
though not handsome character the whole
head in his conversation he had laid aside
all the coarseness dialect which he had so
strongly affected on the preceding evening and
although he continued to speak a little scotch
for the support his character as a young gentleman
 that nation yet it was not in a degree
which either rendered his speech uncouth
or unintelligible but merely afforded a certain
doric tinge essential to the personage he represented
no person on earth could better understand
the society in which he moved exile had
made him acquainted with life in all its shades
and varieties his spirits if not uniform were
 woodstock
elastic he had that species epicurean philosophy
which even in the most extreme difficulties
and dangers can in an interval ease avail
itself the enjoyments the moment he was
in short in youth and misfortune as afterwards
in his regal condition a goodhumoured but hardhearted
voluptuary wise save where his passions
intervened beneficent save when prodigality
had deprived him the means or prejudice 
the wish to confer benefits his faults such as
might often have drawn down hatred but that
they were mingled with so much urbanity that
the injured person felt it impossible to retain the
full sense his wrongs
albert lee found the party consisting his
father sister and the supposed page seated by
the breakfast table at which he also took his
place he was a pensive and anxious beholder
 what passed while the page who had already
completely gained the heart the good old cavalier
by mimicking the manner in which the
scotch divines preached in favour ma gude
lord marquis argyle and the solemn league
and covenant was now endeavouring to interest
woodstock j
the fair alice by such anecdotes partly warlike
and perilous adventure as possessed the same degree
 interest for the female ear which they have
had ever since desdemona's days but it was not
only dangers by land and sea that the disguised
page spoke but much more and much oftener on
foreign revels banquets balls where the pride 
france spain or the low countries was exhibited
in the eyes their most eminent beauties
alice being a very young girl who in consequence
 the civil war had been almost entirely educated
in the country and often in great seclusion
it was certainly no wonder that she should listen
with willing ears and a ready smile to what the
young gentleman their guest and her brother's protege
told with so much gaiety and mingled with
such a shade dangerous adventure and occasionally
 serious reflection as prevented the discourse
from being regarded as merely light and frivolous
in a word sir henry lee laughed alice
smiled from time to time and au were well satisfied
but albert who would himself however have
been scarce able to allege a sufficient reason for
his depression spirits
 woodstock
the materials breakfast were at last removed
under the active superintendence the neathanded
phoebe who looked over her shoulder
and lingered more than once to listen to the
fluent discourse their new guest whom on the
preceding evening she had while in attendance
at supper accounted one the most stupid inmates
to whom the gates woodstock had been
opened since the times fair rosamond
louis kerneguy then when they were left only
four in the chamber without the interruption 
domestics and the successive bustle occasioned by
the discussion and removal the morning meal
became apparently sensible that his friend and
ostensible patron albert ought not altogether to
be suffered to drop to leeward in the conversation
while he was himself successfully engaging
the attention those members his family to
whom he had become so recently known he went
behind his chair therefore and leaning on the
back said with a goodhumoured tone which
made his purpose entirely intelligible
either my good friend guide and patron has
heard worse news this morning than he cares to
woods rock 
tell us or he must liavo stumbled over my tattered
jerkin and leathern hose and acquired by
contact the whole mass stupidity which i threw
off last night with those most dolorous garments
cheer up my dear colonel albert if your affectionate
page may presume to say so you are in
company with those whose society dear to strangers
must be doubly so to you odd's fish man
cheer up i have seen you gay on a biscuit and
a mouthful watercresses don't let your heart
fail you on rhenish wine and venison
dear louis said albert rousing himself
into exertion and somewhat ashamed his own
silence i heave slept worse and been astir earlier
than you
be it so said his father yet i hold it no
good excuse for your sullen silence albert you
have met your sister and me so long separated
from you so anpious on your behalf almost like
mere strangers and yet you are returned safe tous
and you find us well
returned indeed but for safety my dear
father that word must be a stranger to us wore
it s
jilt woodstock
cestcr folks for some time however it is not my
own safety about which i am anxious
 abovit whose then should you be anxious
all accounts agree that the king is safe out 
the dogs jaws
not without some danger though muttered
louis thinking his encounter with bevis on
the preceding evening
no not without danger echoed the knight 
 but as old avill says 
there's such divinity doth hedje a king
that treason dares not peep at what it would
no no thank god that's cared for our hope
and fortune is escaped so all news affirm escaped
from bristol if i thought otherwise albert
i should be as sad as you are for the rest it
i have lurked a month in this house when discovery
would have been death and that is no longer
since than after lord holland and the duke 
buckingham's rising at kingston and hang me
if i thought once twisting my brow into such
ft tragic fold as yours but cocked my hat at misfortune
as a cavalier should
 if i might put in a word said louis it
woodstock g
would be to assure colonel albert lee that i
verily believe the king would think his own hap
wherever he may be much the worse that his best
subjects were seized with dejection on his account
you answer boldly on the king's part young
man said sir henry
oh my father was meikle about the king's
hand answered louis recollecting his present
character
no wonder then said sir henry that
you have so soon recovered your good spirits and
good breeding when you heard his majesty's
escape why you are no more like the lad we
saw last night than the best hunter i ever had was
like a drayhorse
oh there is much in rest and food and
grooming answered louis you would hardly
know the tired jade you dismounted from last
night when she is brought out prancing and neighing
the next morning rested refreshed and ready
to start again especially if the brute hath some
good blood for such pick up unco fast
well then but since thy father was a courtier
and thou hast learned i think something rvf
 woodstock
the trade tell us a little master kerneguy about
him we love most to hear about the king we are
all safe and secret you need not be afraid he
was a hopeful youth i trust his flourishing blossom
now gives promise fruit 
as the knight spoke louis bent his eyes on
the ground and seemed at first uncertain what to
answer but admirable at extricating himself from
such dilemmas he replied that he really could
not presume to speak on such a subject in the
presence his patron colonel albert lee who
must be a much better judge the character 
king charles than he could pretend to be
albert was accordingly next assailed by the
knight seconded by alice for some account 
his majesty s character
i will speak but according to facts said
albert and then i must be acquitted partiality
if the king had not possessed enterprise
and military skill he never would have attempted
the expedition to worcester had he not had
personal courage he had not so long disputed the
battle that cromwell almost judged it lost that
he possesses prudence and patience must be arwoodstock

gucd from the circumstances attending his flight 
and that he has the love his subjects is evident
since necessarily known to many he has been betrayed
by none
for shame albert replied his sister is
that the way a good cavalier doles out the character
 his prince applying an instance at every
concession like a pedlar measuring linen with his
rod out upon you no wonder you were beaten
if you fought as coldly for your king as yoi
now talk for him
i did my best to trace a likeness from what i
have seen and known the original sister alice
replied her brother if you would have a fancy
portrait you must get an artist more imagination
than i have to draw it for you
i will be that artist myself said alice and
in my portrait our monarch shall show all that he
ought to be having such high pretensions all
that he must be being so loftily descended all
that i am sure he is and that every loyal heart
in the kingdom ought to believe him
 well said alice quoth the old knight
 woodstock
look thou upon this picture and on this 
here is our young friend shall judge i wager my
best nag that is i would wager him had i one
left that alice proves the better painter the
two my son's brain is still misty i think since
his defeat he has not got the smoke worcester
out it plague on thee a young man and
cast down for one beating had you been banged
twenty times like me it had been time to look
grave but come alice forward the colours are
mixed on your pallet forward with something
that shall show like one vandyke's living portraits
placed beside the dull dry presentation
there our ancestor victor lee
alice it must be observed had been educated
by her father in the notions high and even exaggerated
loyalty which characterized the cavaliers
and she was really an enthusiast in the royal
cause but besides she was in good spirits at her
brother's happy return and wished to prolong
the gay humour in which her father had late
scarcely ever indulged
well then she said though i am no apel
woodstock q
les i will try to paint an alexander such as i
hope and am determined to believe exists in the
person our exiled sovereign soon i trust to
be restored and i will not go farther than his
own family he shall have all the chivalrous
courage all the warlike skill henry france
his grandfather in order to place him on the
throne all his benevolence love his people
patience even unpleasing advice sacrifice 
his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal
that seated there he may be blest while living
and so long remembered when dead that for ages
after it shall be thought sacrilege to breathe an
aspersion against the throne which he has occupied
 long after he is dead while there remains
an old man who has seen him were the condition
 that survivor no higher than a groom or a
menial his age shall be provided for at the public
charge and his gray hairs regarded with more
distinction than an ears coronet because he remembers
the second charles the monarch 
every heart in england 
while alice spoke she was hardly conscious
 the presence any one save her father and
 woodstock
brother for the page withdrew himself somewhat
from the circle and there was nothing to remind
her him she gave the reins therefore to her
enthusiasm and as the tears glittered in her eye
and her beautiful features became animated she
seemed like a descended cherub proclaiming the
virtues a patriot monarch the person chiefly
interested in her description held himself back as
we have said and concealed his own features yet
so as to preserve a full view the beautiful
speaker
albert lee conscious in whose presence this
eulogium was pronounced was much embarrassed
 but his father all whose feelings were flattered
by the panegyric was in rapture
so much for the king alice he said and
now for the mem
for the man replied alice in the same tone
need wish him more than the paternal virtues
 his unhappy father whom his worst enemies
have recorded that if moral virtues and religious
faith were to be selected as the qualities which
merited a crown no man could plead the possession
 them in a higher or more indisputable dcwoodstock

grec temperate wise and frugal yet munificent
in rewarding merit a friend to letters and
the muses but a severe discourager the misuse
 such gifts a worthy gentleman a kind master
 the best friend the best father the best
christian her voice began to falter and
her father's handkerchief was already at his eyes
he was girl he was exclaimed sir henry 
but no more on't i charge ye no more on't
enough let his son but possess his virtues with
better advisers and better fortunes and he will
be all that england in her warmest wishes could
desire
there was a pause after this for alice felt as
if she had spoken too frankly and too zealously
for her sex and youth sir henry was occupied
in melancholy recollections on the fate his late
sovereign while kerneguy and his supposed patron
felt embarrassed perhaps from a consciousness
that the real charles fell far short his ideal
character as designed in such glowing colours in
some cases exaggerated or inappropriate praise
becomes the most severe satire
 woodstock
but such reflections were not a nature to belong
willingly cherished by the person to whom
they might have been great advantage he assumed
a tone raillery which is perhaps the
readiest mode escaping from the feelings selfreproof
 every cavalier he said should
bend his knee to thank mistress alice lee for
having made such a flattering portrait the king
their master by laying under contribution for his
benefit the virtues all his ancestors only there
was one point he would not have expected a female
painter to have passed over in silence when she
made him in right his grandfather and father
a muster royal and individual excellencies why
could she not have endowed him at the same time
with his mother's personal charms why should
not the son henrietta maria the finest woman
 her day add the recommendations a
handsome face and figure to his internal e
vxl u
 woodstock
come very imminent he was glad therefore 
comparative repose and comparative safety
then it must be considered that charles had
been entirely reconciled to the society at woodstock
since he had become better acquainted with
it he had seen that to interest the beautiful
alice and procure a great deal her company
nothing more was necessary than to submit to the
humours and cultivate the intimacy the old
cavalier her father a few bouts at fencing in
which charles took care not to put out his more
perfect skill and full youthful strength and activity
 the endurance a few scenes from shakspeare
which the knight read with more zeal than
taste a little skill in music in which the old
man had been a proficient the deference paid to
a few oldfashioned opinions at which he laughed
in his sleeve were allsufficient to gain for the
disguised prince an interest in sir henry lee
and to conciliate in an equal degree the goodwill
 his lovely daughter
never were two young persons who could be
said to commence this species intimacy with
such unequal advantages charles was a liberwoodstock

tine who if he did not in cold blood resolve upon
prosecuting his passion for auce to a dishonourable
conclusion was at every moment liable
to be provoked to attempt the strength a virtue
in which he was no believer then auce on her
part hardly knew even what was implied by the
word libertine or seducer her mother had died
early in the commencement the civil war and
she had been bred up chiefly with her brother and
cousin so that she had an unfearing and unsuspicious
frankness manner upon which charles
was not unwilling or unlikely to put a construction
favourable to his own views even alice's
love for her cousin the first sensation which
awakens the most innocent and simple mind to
feelings shyness and restraint towards the male
sex in general had failed to awaken such an
alarm in her bosom they were nearly related 
and everard though young was several years
her elder and had from her infancy been an
object her respect as well as her affection
when this early and childish intimacy ripened
into youthful love confessed and returned still
it differed in some shades from the passion exists
woodstock
ing between lovers originally strangers to each
other until their affections have been united in the
ordinary course courtship their love was
fonder more familiar more perfectly confidential 
purer too perhaps and more free from starts 
passionate violence or apprehensive jealousy
the possibility that any one could have attempted
to rival everard in her affection was a
circumstance which never occurred to alice and
that this singular scottish lad whom she laughed
with on account his humour and laughed
at for his peculiarities should be an object 
danger or caution never once entered her
imagination the sort intimacy to which she
admitted kerneguy was the same to which she
would have received a companion her own sex
whose manners she did not always approve but
whose society she found amusing
it was natural that the freedom alice lee's
conduct which arose from the most perfect indifference
should pass for something approaching
to encouragement in the royal gallant's apprehension
and that any resolutions he had formed
against being tempted to violate the hospitality
woodstock 
 woodstock should begin to totter as opportunities
for doing so became more frequent
these opportunities were favoured by albert's
departure from woodstock the very day after his
arrival it had been agreed in full council with
charles and rochecliffe that lee should go to
visit his uncle everard in the county kent
and by showing himself there should obviate
any cause suspicion which might arise from
his residence at woodstock and remove any pretext
for disturbing his father's family on account
 their harbouring one who had been so lately
in arms he had also undertaken at his own
great personal risk to visit different points on the
seacoast and ascertain the security different
places for providing shipping for the king's leaving
england
these circumstances were alike calculated to
procure the king's safety and facilitate his escape
but alice was thereby deprived the presence
 her brother who would have been her most
watchful guardian but who had set down the
king's light talk upon a former occasion to the
gaiety his humour and would have thought
 woodstock
he had done his sovereign great injustice had
he seriously suspected him such a breach 
hospitality as a dishonourable pursuit alice
would have implied
there were however two the household at
woodstock who appeared not so entirely reconciled
with louis kerneguy or his purposes the
one was bevis who seemed from their first unfriendly
rencontre to have kept up a pique against
their new guest which no advances on the part 
charles were able to soften if the page was
by chance left alone with his young mistress bevis
chose always to be the party came close
by alice's chair and growled audibly when the
gallant drew near her it is a pity said the
disguised prince that your bevis is not a bulldog
that we might dub him a roundhead at
once he is too handsome too noble too aristocratic
to nourish those inhospitable prejudices
against a poor houseless cavalier i am convinced
the spirit pym or hampden has transmigrated
into the rogue and continues to demonstrate
his hatred against royalty and all its adherents

wojstock 
alice would then reply that bevis was loyal
in word and deed and only partook her father's
prejudices against the scots which she could not
but acknowledge were tolerably strong
nay then said the supposed louis i
must find some other reason for i cannot allow
sir bevis's resentment to rest upon national antipathy
so we will suppose that some gallant
cavalier who wended to the wars and never returned
has adopted this shape to look back upon
the haunts he left so unwillingly and is jealous
at seeing even poor louis kerneguy drawing near
to the lady his lost affections he approached
her chair as he spoke and bevis gave one 
his deep growls
 in that case you had best keep your distance
said alice laughing for the bite a
dog possessed by the ghost a jealous lover
cannot be very safe and the king carried on
the dialogue in the same strain which while it
led alice to apprehend nothing more serious
than the apish gallantry a fantastic boy certainly
induced the supposed louis kerneguy to
think that he had made one those conquests
 woodstock
which often and easily fall to the share sovereigns
notwithstanding the acuteness his apprehension
he was not sufficiently aware that
the royal road to female favour is only open to
monarch s when they travel in grand costume and
that when they woo incognito their path courtship
is liable to the same windings and obstacles
which obstruct the course private individuals
there was besides bevis another member 
the family who kept a lookout upon louis
kerneguy and with no friendly eye phoebe
mayflower though her experience extended not
beyond the sphere the village yet knew the
world much better than her mistress and besides
she was five years older more knowing
she was more suspicious she thought that oddlooking
scotch boy made more up to her young
mistress than was proper for his condition 
life and moreover that alice gave him a little
more encouragement than parthenon would have
afforded to any such jackadandy in the absence
 aratus for the volume treating the
loves these celebrated arcadian was then the
woodstock 
favourite study swains and damsels throughout
merry england entertaining such suspicions
phoebe was at a loss how to conduct herself
on the occasion and yet resolved she would
not see the slightest chance the course colonel
everard's true love being obstructed without
attempting a remedy she had a peculiar
favour for markham herself and moreover he
was according to her phrase as handsome and
personable a young man as was in oxfordshire 
and this scotch scarecrow was no more to be
compared to him than chalk was to cheese and
yet she allowed that master girnigy had a wonderfully
welloiled tongue and that such gallants
were not to be despised what was to be done 
she had no facts to offer only vague suspicion 
and was afraid to speak to her mistress whose
kindness great as it was did not nevertheless
encourage familiarity
she sounded joceline but he was she knew
not why so deeply interested about this unlucky
lad and held this importance so high that she
could make no impression on him to speak
to the old knight would have been to raic a gc
 woodstock
neral tempest the worthy chaplain who was at
woodstock grand referee on all disputed matters
would have been the damsels most natural resource
for he was peaceful as well as moral by
profession and politic by practice but it happened
he had given phoebe unintentional offence
by speaking her under the classical epithet 
rustica fidele the which epithet as she understood
it not she held herself bound to resent as
contumelious and declaring she was not fonder 
a fiddle than other folks had ever since shunned
all intercourse with doctor rochecliffe which she
could easily avoid
master tomkins was always coming and going
about the house under various pretexts but he
was a roundhead and she was too true to the cavaliers
to introduce any the enemy as parties
to their internal discords besides he had talked
to phoebe herself in a manner which induced her
to decline everything in the shape familiarity
with him lastly cavaliers wildrake might have
been consulted but phoebe had her own reasons
for saying as she did with some emphasis that
cavaliers wildrake was an impudent london
woodstock 
rake at length she resolved to communicate
her suspicions to the party having most interest
in verifying or confuting them
i'll let master markham everard know that
there is a wasp buzzing about his honeycombs
said phoebe and moreover that i know that
this young scotch scapegrace shifted himself out
 a woman's into a man's dress at goody green's
and gave goody green's dolly a goldpiece to say
nothing about it and no more she did to anyone
but me and she knows best herself whether
she gave change for the gold or not but master
louis is a saucy jackanapes and like enough
to ask it
three or four days elapsed while matters continued
in this condition the disguised prince
sometimes thinking on the intrigue which fortune
seemed to have thrown in his way for his
amusement and taking advantage such opportunities
as occurred to increase his intimacy with
alice lee but much oftener harassing doctor
rochecliffe with questions about the possibility
 escape which the good man finding himself unable
to answer secured his leisure against royal
 woodstock
importunity by retreating into the various unexplored
recesses the lodge known perhaps
only to himself who had been for nearly a score
 years employed in writing the wonders 
avoid stock
it chanced on the fourth day that some trifling
circumstance had called the knight abroad 
and he had left the young scotchman now familiar
in the family alone with alice in the parlour
 victor lee thus situated he thought the
time not unpropitious for entering upon a strain
 gallantry a kind which might be called experimental
such as is practised by the croats in
skirmishing when they keep bridle in hand ready
to attack the enemy or canter off without coming
to close quarters as circumstances may recommend
after using for nearly ten minutes a
sort metaphysical jargon which might according
to ahces pleasure have been interpreted
either into gallantry or the language serious
pretension and when he supposed her engaged
in fathoming his meaning he had the mortification
to find by a single and brief question that
he had been totally unattended to and that alice
woodstock 
was thinking on anything at the moment rather
than the sense what he had been saying she
asked him if he could tell what it was o'clock
and this with an air real curiosity concerning
the lapse time which put coquetry wholly out
 the question
i will go look at the sundial mistress
alice said the gallant rising and colouring
through a sense the contempt with which he
thought himself treated
you will do me a pleasure master kerneguy
said alice without the least consciousness
 the indignation she had excited
master louis kerneguy left the room accordingly
not however to procure the information
required but to vent his anger and mortification
and to swear with more serious purpose than he
had dared to do before that alice should rue
her insolence goodnatured as he was he was
still a prince unaccustomed to contradiction far
less to contempt and his self pride felt for the
moment wounded to the quick with a hasty
step he plunged into the chase only remembering
his own safety so far as to choose the deeper
 woodstock
and sequestered avenues where walking on with
the speedy and active step which his recovery
from fatigue now permitted him to exercise according
to his wont he solaced his angry purposes
by devising schemes revenge on the
insolent country coquette from which no consideration
 hospitality was in future to have
weight enough to save her
the irritated gallant passed
the dialstone aged and green
without deigning to ask it a single question nor
could it have satisfied his curiosity if he had for
no sun happened to shine at the moment he
then hastened forward muffling himself in his
cloak and assuming a stooping and slouching
gait which diminished his apparent height he
was soon involved in the deep and dim alleys 
the wood into which he had insensibly plunged
himself and was traversing it at a great rate
without having any distinct idea in what direction
he was going when suddenly his course was
arrested first by a loud hollo and then by a
summons to stand accompanied by what seemed
woodstock 
still more startling and extraordinary the touch
 a cane upon his shoulder imposed in a goodhumoured
but somewhat imperious manner
there were few symptoms recognition which
would have been welcome at this moment but
the appearance the person who had thus arrested
his course was least all that he could
have anticipated as timely or agreeable when he
turned on receiving the signal he beheld himself
close to a young man nearly six feet in height
well made in joint and limb but the gravity 
whose apparel although handsome and gentlemanlike
and a sort precision in his habit
from the cleanness and stiffness his band to
the unsullied purity his spanish leather shoes
bespoke a love order which was foreign to the
impoverished and vanquished cavaliers and proper
to the habits those the victorious party
who could afford to dress themselves handsomely 
and whose rule that is such as regarded the
higher and more respectable classes enjoined
decency and sobriety garb and deportment
there was yet another weight against the prince
in the scale and one still more characteristic 
 woodstock
the inequality in the comparison under which he
seemed to labour there was strength in the
muscular form the stranger who had brought
him to this involuntary parley authority and determination
in his brow a long rapier on the left
and a poniard or dagger on the right side his
belt and a pair pistols stuck into it which
would have been sufficient to give the unknown
the advantage louis kerneguy having no weapon
but his sword even had his personal strength
approached nearer than it did to that the person
by whom he was thus suddenly stopped
bitterly regretting the thoughtless fit passion
that brought him into his present situation
but especially the want the pistols he had left
behind and which do so much to place bodily
strength and weakness upon an equal footing
charles yet availed himself the courage and
presence mind in which few his unfortunate
family had for centuries been deficient he
stood firm and without motion his cloak still
wrapped round the lower part his face to
give time for explanation in case he was mistaken
for some other person
woodstock
this coolness produced its effect for the other
party said with doubt and surprise on his part
joceline johffe is it not if i know not jofeline
joliffe i should at least know my own
cloak
i am not joceline joliffe as you may see
sir said kerneguy calmly drawing himself
erect to show the difference size and dropping
the cloak from his face and person
indeed replied the stranger in surprise 
 then sir unknown i have to express my regret
at having used my cane in intimating that i
wished you to stop from that dress which i
certainly recognize for my own i concluded you
must be joceline in whose custody i had left my
habit at the lodge
if it had been joceline sir replied the
supposed kerneguy with perfect composure
methinks you should not have struck so hard
the other party was obviously confused by
the steady calmness with which he was encountered
the sense politeness dictated in the first
place an apology for a mistake when he thought
he had been tolerably certain the person masvol
 x
 woodstock
ter kerneguy was not in a situation to be punctilious
 he bowed gravely as indicating his acceptance
 the excuse offered then turned and
walked as he conceived towards the lodge
though he had traversed the woods which were
cut with various alleys in different directions too
hastily to be certain the real course which he
wished to pursue
he was much embarrassed to find that this
did not get him rid the companion whom he
had thus involuntarily acquired walked he
slow walked he fast his friend in the genteel
but puritanic habit strong in person and well
armed as we have described him seemed determined
to keep him company and without attempting
to join or enter into conversation never
suffered him to outstrip his surveillance for more
than two or three yards the wanderer mended
his pace but although he was then in his
youth as afterwards in his riper age one the
best walkers in britain the stranger without advancing
his pace to a run kept fully equal to
him and his persecution became so close and
constant and inevitable that the pride and fear
woodstock 
 charles were both alarmed and he began to
think that whatever the danger might be a
singlehanded rencontre he would nevertheless
have a better bargain this tall satellite if they
settled the debate betwixt them in the forest than
if they drew near any place habitation where
the man in authority was likely to find friends and
concurrence
betwixt anxiety therefore vexation and anger
charles faced suddenly round on his pursuer as
they reached a small narrow glade which led to
the little meadow over which presided the kmgs
oak the ragged and scathed branches and gigantic
trunk which formed a vista to the little
wild avenue
sir said he to his pursuer you have already
been guilty one piece impertinence
towards me you have apologised and knowing
no reason why you should distinguish me as an
object incivility i have accepted your excuse
without scruple is there anything remains to
be settled betwixt us which causes you to follow
me in this manner if so i shall be glad to make
it a subject explanation or satisfaction as the
 woodstock
case may admit i think you can owe me no
malice for i never saw you before to my knowledge
if you can give any good reason for asking
it i am willing to render you personal satisfaction
if your purpose is merely impertinent
curiosity i let you know that i will not suffer
myself to be dogged in my private walks by anyone

when i recognize my own cloak on another
man's shoulders replied the stranger drily
methinks i have a natural right to follow and
see what becomes it for know sir though i
have been mistaken as to the wearer yet i am
confident i had as good a right to stretch my cane
across the cloak you are muffled in as ever had
any one to brush his own garments if therefore
wg are to be friends i must ask for instance
how you came by that cloak and where you are
going with it i shall otherwise make bold to stop
you as one who has sufficient commission to do
so
oh unhappy cloak thought the wanderer
ay and thrice unhappy the idle fancy that sent
me here with it wrapped around my nose to pick
woodstock 
quarrels and attract observation when quiet and
secrecy were peculiarly essential to my safety 
if you will allow me to guess sir continued
the stranger who was no other than markham
everard i will convince you that you are better
known than you think for
now heaven forbid prayed the party addressed
in silence but with as much devotion as
ever he applied to a prayer in his life yet even
in this moment extreme urgency his courage
and composure did not fail and he recollected
it was the utmost importance not to seem startled
and to answer so as if possible to lead the
dangerous companion with whom he had met to
confess the extent his actual knowledge or suspicions
concerning him
if you know me sir he said and are a
gentleman as your appearance promises you
cannot be at a loss to what accident you must attribute
my wearing these clothes which you say
are yours
oh sir replied colonel everard his wrath
in no sort turned away by the mildness the
stranger's answer we have learned our ovid's
 woodstock
metamorphoses and we know for what purposes
young men quality travel in disguise we know
that even female attire is resorted to on certain
occasions we have heard vertumnus and
pomona
the monarch as he weighed these words
again uttered a devout prayer that this illlooking
affair might have no deeper root than the
jealousy some admirer alice lee promising
to himself that devotee as he was to the fair sex
he would make no scruple renouncing the
fairest eve's daughters in order to get out 
the present dilemma
sir he said you seem to be a gentleman
i have no objection to tell you as such that i also
am that class
or somewhat higher perhaps said everard

a gentleman is a term which comprehends
all ranks entitled to armorial bearings a duke
a lord a prince is no more than a gentleman 
and if in misfortune as i am he may be glad if
that general term courtesy is allowed him
sir replied everard i have no purpose
woodstock s
to entrap you to any acknowledgement fatal to
your own safety nor do i hold it my business
to be active in the arrest private individuals
whose perverted sense national duty may have
led them into errors rather to be pitied than
punished by candid men but if those who have
brought civil war and disturbance into their
native country proceed to carry dishonour and
disgrace into the bosom families if they attempt
to carry on their private debaucheries to
the injury the hospitable roofs which afford
them refuge from the consequences their public
crimes do you think ray lord that we shall
bear it with patience 
if it is your purpose to quarrel with me said
the prince speak it out at once like a gentleman
you have the advantage no doubt arras but
it is not that odds which will induce rae to fly
from a single man if on the other hand you
are disposed to hear reason i tell you in calm
words that i neither suspect the offence to which
you allude nor comprehend why you give me
the title ray lord
 woodstock
you deny then being the lord wilmot 
said everard
i may do so most safely said the prince
perhaps you rather style yourself earl 
rochester we heard that the issuing some
such patent by the king scots was a step which
your ambition proposed
neither lord nor earl am i as sure as i have
a christian soul to be saved my name is 
do not degrade yourself by unnecessary falsehood
my lord and that to a single man who 
promise you will not invoke public justice to assist
his own good sword should he see cause to
use it can you look at that ring and deny that
you are lord wilmot 
he handed to the disguised prince a ring which
he took from his purse and his opponent instantly
knew it for the same he had dropped into alice's
pitcher at the fountain obeying only though imprudently
the gallantry the moment in giving
a pretty gem to a handsome girl whom he had
accidentally frightened
i know the ring he said it has been in
my possession how it should prove me to be
woodstock 
lord wilmot i cannot conceive and beg to
say it bears false witness against me
you shall see the evidence answered everard
 and resuming the ring he pressed a spring
ingeniously contrived in the collet the setting
on which the stone flew back and showed within
it the cypher lord wilmot beautifully engraved
in miniature with a coronet what say
you now sir 
that probabilities are no proofs said the
prince there is nothing here save what can be
easily accounted for i am the son a scottish
nobleman who was mortally wounded and made
prisoner at worcester fight when he took leave
and bid me fly he gave me the few valuables he
possessed and that among others i have heard
him talk having changed rings with lord
wilmot on some occasion in scotland but 
never knew the trick the gem which you have
shown me
in this it may be necessary to say charles
spoke very truly nor would he have parted with
it in the way he did had he suspected it would be
easily recognised he proceeded after a minute's
vol y
 woodstock
pause once more sir i have told you
much that concerns my safety if you are generous
you will let me pass and i may do you on
some future day as good service if you mean
to arrest me ycu must do so here and at your
own peril for i will neither walk farther your
way nor permit you to dog me on mine if
you let me pass i will thank you if not take to
your weapon
young gentleman said colonel everard
whether you be actually the gay young nobleman
for whom i took you you have made
me uncertain but intimate as you say your
family has been with him i have little doubt
that you are proficient in the school debauchery
 which wilmot and villiers are professors
and their hopeful master a graduated student
your conduct at woodstock where you have
rewarded the hospitality the family by meditating
the most deadly wound to their honour
has proved you too apt a scholar in such an academy
i intended only to warn you on this subjects
will be your own fault if i add chastisement
to admonition
woodstock ss
warn me sir said the prince indignantly
and chastisement this is presuming more on
my patience than is consistent with yovu own
safety draw sir so saying he laid his hand
on his sword
my religion said everard forbids me to
be rash in shedding blood go home sir be
wise consult the dictates honour as well as
prudence respect the honour the house 
lee and know there is one nearly allied to it by
whom your motions will be called to severe accounts

aha said the prince with a bitter laugh
i see the whole matter now we have our
roundheaded colonel our puritan cousin before
us the man texts and morals whom alice
lee laughs at so heartily if your religion sir
prevents you from giving satisfaction it should
prevent you from offering insult to a person 
honour
the passions both were now fully up they
drew mutually and began to fight the colonel
relinquishing the advantage he could have obtained
by the use his firearms a thrust 
 woodstock
the arm or a slip the foot might at the
moment have changed the destinies britain
when the arrival a third party broke off the
combat

the gray champion

there was once a time when new england groaned under the actual
pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on
the revolution james ii the bigoted successor of charles the
voluptuous had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a
harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger
our religion the administration of sir edmund andros lacked scarcely
a single characteristic of tyranny a governor and council holding
office from the king and wholly independent of the country laws made
and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by
their representatives the rights of private citizens violated and the
titles of all landed property declared void the voice of complaint
stifled by restrictions on the press and finally disaffection
overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on
our free soil for two years our ancestors were kept in sullen
submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their
allegiance to the mother-country whether its head chanced to be a
parliament protector or popish monarch till these evil times
however such allegiance had been merely nominal and the colonists
had ruled themselves enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the
privilege of the native subjects of great britain

at length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of orange had
ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of
civil and religious rights and the salvation of new england it was
but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail
and in either case the man that stirred against king james would lose
his head still the intelligence produced a marked effect the people
smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their
oppressors while far and wide there was a subdued and silent
agitation as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from
its sluggish despondency aware of their danger the rulers resolved
to avert it by an imposing display of strength and perhaps to confirm
their despotism by yet harsher measures

one afternoon in april sir edmund andros and his favorite
councillors being warm with wine assembled the red-coats of the
governor's guard and made their appearance in the streets of boston
the sun was near setting when the march commenced the roll of the
drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as
the martial music of the soldiers than as a muster-call to the
inhabitants themselves a multitude by various avenues assembled in
king street which was destined to be the scene nearly a century
afterward of another encounter between the troops of britain and a
people struggling against her tyranny

though more than sixty years had elapsed since the pilgrims came this
crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features
of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency
than on happier occasions there was the sober garb the general
severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural
forms of speech and the confidence in heaven's blessing on a righteous
cause which would have marked a band of the original puritans when
threatened by some peril of the wilderness indeed it was not yet
time for the old spirit to be extinct since there were men in the
street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a
house was reared to the god for whom they had become exiles old
soldiers of the parliament were here too smiling grimly at the
thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the
house of stuart here also were the veterans of king philip's war
who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious
fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them
with prayer several ministers were scattered among the crowd which
unlike all other mobs regarded them with such reverence as if there
were sanctity in their very garments these holy men exerted their
influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them

meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the
town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country
into a ferment was almost the universal subject of inquiry and
variously explained

satan will strike his master-stroke presently cried some because
he knoweth that his time is short all our godly pastors are to be
dragged to prison we shall see them at a smithfield fire in king
street

hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their
minister who looked calmly upward and assumed a more apostolic
dignity as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his
profession a crown of martyrdom it was actually fancied at that
period that new england might have a john rogers of her own to take
the place of that worthy in the primer

the pope of rome has given orders for a new st bartholomew cried
others we are to be massacred man and male-child

neither was this rumor wholly discredited although the wiser class
believed the governor's object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor
under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first
settlers was known to be in town there were grounds for conjecturing
that sir edmund andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of
military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing
himself of their chief

stand firm for the old charter-governor shouted the crowd seizing
upon the idea the good old governor bradstreet

while this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the
well-known figure of governor bradstreet himself a patriarch of
nearly ninety who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with
characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted
authorities

my children concluded this venerable person do nothing rashly
cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of new england and expect
patiently what the lord will do in this matter

the event was soon to be decided all this time the roll of the drum
had been approaching through cornhill louder and deeper till with
reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial
footsteps it burst into the street a double rank of soldiers made
their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with
shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of
fires in the dusk their steady march was like the progress of a
machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way next
moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode
a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being sir edmund
andros elderly but erect and soldier-like those around him were his
favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of new england at his
right hand rode edward randolph our arch-enemy that blasted
wretch as cotton mather calls him who achieved the downfall of our
ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse-through life
and to his grave on the other side was bullivant scattering jests
and mockery as he rode along dudley came behind with a downcast look
dreading as well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people
who beheld him their only countryman by birth among the oppressors
of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or
three civil officers under the crown were also there but the figure
which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling
was the episcopal clergyman of king's chapel riding haughtily among
the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representative
of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all
those abominations which had driven the puritans to the wilderness
another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear

the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england and its
moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the
nature of things and the character of the people on one side the
religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the
other the group of despotic rulers with the high churchman in the
midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently
clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the
universal groan and the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to
deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience
could be secured

o lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion
for thy people

this ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a herald's cry to
introduce a remarkable personage the crowd had rolled back and were
now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the
soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length the
intervening space was empty a paved solitude between lofty edifices
which threw almost a twilight shadow over it suddenly there was seen
the figure of an ancient man who seemed to have emerged from among the
people and was walking by himself along the centre of the street to
confront the armed band he wore the old puritan dress a dark cloak
and a steeple-crowned hat in the fashion of at least fifty years
before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a staff in his hand to
assist the tremulous gait of age

when at some distance from the multitude the old man turned slowly
round displaying a face of antique majesty rendered doubly venerable
by the hoary beard that descended on his breast he made a gesture at
once of encouragement and warning then turned again and resumed his
way

who is this gray patriarch asked the young men of their sires

who is this venerable brother asked the old men among themselves

but none could make reply the fathers of the people those of
fourscore years and upward were disturbed deeming it strange that
they should forget one of such evident authority whom they must have
known in their early days the associate of winthrop and all the old
councillors giving laws and making prayers and leading them against
the savage the elderly men ought to have remembered him too with
locks as gray in their youth as their own were now and the young how
could he have passed so utterly from their memories that hoary sire
the relic of long-departed times whose awful benediction had surely
been bestowed on their uncovered heads in childhood

whence did he come what is his purpose who can this old man be
whispered the wondering crowd

meanwhile the venerable stranger staff in hand was pursuing his
solitary walk along the centre of the street as he drew near the
advancing soldiers and as the roll of their drum came full upon his
ear the old man raised himself to a loftier mien while the
decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders leaving him in
gray but unbroken dignity now he marched onward with a warrior's
step keeping time to the military music thus the aged form advanced
on one side and the whole parade of soldiers and magistrates on the
other till when scarcely twenty yards remained between the old man
grasped his staff by the middle and held it before him like a leader's
truncheon

stand cried he

the eye the face and attitude of command the solemn yet warlike peal
of that voice fit either to rule a host in the battle-field or be
raised to god in prayer were irresistible at the old man's word and
outstretched arm the roll of the drum was hushed at once and the
advancing line stood still a tremulous enthusiasm seized upon the
multitude that stately form combining the leader and the saint so
gray so dimly seen in such an ancient garb could only belong to
some old champion of the righteous cause whom the oppressor's drum had
summoned from his grave they raised a shout of awe and exultation
and looked for the deliverance of new england

the governor and the gentlemen of his party perceiving themselves
brought to an unexpected stand rode hastily forward as if they would
have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses right against the
hoary apparition he however blenched not a step but glancing his
severe eye round the group which half encompassed him at last bent
it sternly on sir edmund andros one would have thought that the dark
old man was chief ruler there and that the governor and council with
soldiers at their back representing the whole power and authority of
the crown had no alternative but obedience

what does this old fellow here cried edward randolph fiercely on
sir edmund bid the soldiers forward and give the dotard the same
choice that you give all his countrymen to stand aside or be trampled
on

nay nay let us show respect to the good grandsire said bullivant
laughing see you not he is some old round-headed dignitary who hath
lain asleep these thirty years and knows nothing of the change of
times doubtless he thinks to put us down with a proclamation in old
noll's name

are you mad old man demanded sir edmund andros in loud and harsh
tones how dare you stay the march of king james's governor

i have stayed the march of a king himself ere now replied the gray
figure with stern composure i am here sir governor because the
cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my secret place and
beseeching this favor earnestly of the lord it was vouchsafed me to
appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saints and
what speak ye of james there is no longer a popish tyrant on the
throne of england and by to-morrow noon his name shall be a by-word
in this very street where ye would make it a word of terror back
thou that wast a governor back with this night thy power is ended
to-morrow the prison back lest i foretell the scaffold

the people had been drawing nearer and nearer and drinking in the
words of their champion who spoke in accents long disused like one
unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many years ago but
his voice stirred their souls they confronted the soldiers not
wholly without arms and ready to convert the very stones of the street
into deadly weapons sir edmund andros looked at the old man then he
cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and beheld them burning
with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench and again
he fixed his gaze on the aged form which stood obscurely in an open
space where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself what were his
thoughts he uttered no word which might discover but whether the
oppressor were overawed by the gray champion's look or perceived his
peril in the threatening attitude of the people it is certain that he
gave back and ordered his soldiers to commence a slow and guarded
retreat before another sunset the governor and all that rode so
proudly with him were prisoners and long ere it was known that james
had abdicated king william was proclaimed throughout new england

but where was the gray champion some reported that when the troops
had gone from king street and the people were thronging tumultuously
in their rear bradstreet the aged governor was seen to embrace a
form more aged than his own others soberly affirmed that while they
marvelled at the venerable grandeur of his aspect the old man had
faded from their eyes melting slowly into the hues of twilight till
where he stood there was an empty space but all agreed that the hoary
shape was gone the men of that generation watched for his
reappearance in sunshine and in twilight but never saw him more nor
knew when his funeral passed nor where his gravestone was

and who was the gray champion perhaps his name might be found in the
records of that stern court of justice which passed a sentence too
mighty for the age but glorious in all after-times for its humbling
lesson to the monarch and its high example to the subject i have
heard that whenever the descendants of the puritans are to show the
spirit of their sires the old man appears again when eighty years had
passed he walked once more in king street five years later in the
twilight of an april morning he stood on the green beside the
meeting-house at lexington where now the obelisk of granite with a
slab of slate inlaid commemorates the first-fallen of the revolution
and when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on bunker's hill
all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds long long
may it be ere he comes again his hour is one of darkness and
adversity and peril but should domestic tyranny oppress us or the
invader's step pollute our soil still may the gray champion come for
he is the type of new england's hereditary spirit and his shadowy
march on the eve of danger must ever be the pledge that new england's
sons will vindicate their ancestry




sunday at home


every sabbath morning in the summer-time i thrust back the curtain to
watch the sunrise stealing down a steeple which stands opposite my
chamber window first the weathercock begins to flash then a fainter
lustre gives the spire an airy aspect next it encroaches on the tower
and causes the index of the dial to glisten like gold as it points to
the gilded figure of the hour now the loftiest window gleams and now
the lower the carved framework of the portal is marked strongly out
at length the morning glory in its descent from heaven comes down the
stone steps one by one and there stands the steeple glowing with
fresh radiance while the shades of twilight still hide themselves
among the nooks of the adjacent buildings methinks though the same
sun brightens it every fair morning yet the steeple has a peculiar
robe of brightness for the sabbath

by dwelling near a church a person soon contracts an attachment for
the edifice we naturally personify it and conceive its massy walls
and its dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm and meditative and
somewhat melancholy spirit but the steeple stands foremost in our
thoughts as well as locally it impresses us as a giant with a mind
comprehensive and discriminating enough to care for the great and
small concerns of all the town hourly while it speaks a moral to the
few that think it reminds thousands of busy individuals of their
separate and most secret affairs it is the steeple too that flings
abroad the hurried and irregular accents of general alarm neither
have gladness and festivity found a better utterance than by its
tongue and when the dead are slowly passing to their home the
steeple has a melancholy voice to bid them welcome yet in spite of
this connection with human interests what a moral loneliness on
week-days broods round about its stately height it has no kindred
with the houses above which it towers it looks down into the narrow
thoroughfare the lonelier because the crowd are elbowing their
passage at its base a glance at the body of the church deepens this
impression within by the light of distant windows amid refracted
shadows we discern the vacant pews and empty galleries the silent
organ the voiceless pulpit and the clock which tells to solitude how
time is passing time where man lives not what is it but eternity
and in the church we might suppose are garnered up throughout the
week all thoughts and feelings that have reference to eternity until
the holy day comes round again to let them forth might not then its
more appropriate site be in the outskirts of the town with space for
old trees to wave around it and throw their solemn shadows over a
quiet green we will say more of this hereafter

but on the sabbath i watch the earliest sunshine and fancy that a
holier brightness marks the day when there shall be no buzz of voices
on the exchange nor traffic in the shops nor crowd nor business
anywhere but at church many have fancied so for my own part whether
i see it scattered down among tangled woods or beaming broad across
the fields or hemmed in between brick buildings or tracing out the
figure of the casement on my chamber floor still i recognize the
sabbath sunshine and ever let me recognize it some illusions and
this among them are the shadows of great truths doubts may flit
around me or seem to close their evil wings and settle down but so
long as i imagine that the earth is hallowed and the light of heaven
retains its sanctity on the sabbath while that blessed sunshine lives
within me never can my soul have lost the instinct of its faith if
it have gone astray it will return again

i love to spend such pleasant sabbaths from morning till night behind
the curtain of my open window are they spent amiss every spot so
near the church as to be visited by the circling shadow of the steeple
should be deemed consecrated ground to-day with stronger truth be it
said that a devout heart may consecrate a den of thieves as an evil
one may convert a temple to the same my heart perhaps has no such
holy nor i would fain trust such impious potency it must suffice
that though my form be absent my inner man goes constantly to
church while many whose bodily presence fills the accustomed seats
have left their souls at home but i am there even before my friend
the sexton at length he comes a man of kindly but sombre aspect in
dark gray clothes and hair of the same mixture he comes and applies
his key to the wide portal now my thoughts may go in among the dusty
pews or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege but soon come forth again
to enjoy the music of the bell how glad yet solemn too all the
steeples in town are talking together aloft in the sunny air and
rejoicing among themselves while their spires point heavenward
meantime here are the children assembling to the sabbath-school
which is kept somewhere within the church often while looking at the
arched portal i have been gladdened by the sight of a score of these
little girls and boys in pink blue yellow and crimson frocks
bursting suddenly forth into the sunshine like a swarm of gay
butterflies that had been shut up in the solemn gloom or i might
compare them to cherubs haunting that holy place

about a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell
individuals of the congregation begin to appear the earliest is
invariably an old woman in black whose bent frame and rounded
shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction which she is
eager to rest upon the altar would that the sabbath came twice as
often for the sake of that sorrowful old soul there is an elderly
man also who arrives in good season and leans against the corner of
the tower just within the line of its shadow looking downward with a
darksome brow i sometimes fancy that the old woman is the happier of
the two after these others drop in singly and by twos and threes
either disappearing through the doorway or taking their stand in its
vicinity at last and always with an unexpected sensation the bell
turns in the steeple overhead and throws out an irregular clangor
jarring the tower to its foundation as if there were magic in the
sound the sidewalks of the street both up and down along are
immediately thronged with two long lines of people all converging
hitherward and streaming into the church perhaps the far-off roar of
a coach draws nearer a deeper thunder by its contrast with the
surrounding stillness until it sets down the wealthy worshippers at
the portal among their humblest brethren beyond that entrance in
theory at least there are no distinctions of earthly rank nor
indeed by the goodly apparel which is flaunting in the sun would
there seem to be such on the hither side those pretty girls why will
they disturb my pious meditations of all days in the week they
should strive to look least fascinating on the sabbath instead of
heightening their mortal loveliness as if to rival the blessed angels
and keep our thoughts from heaven were i the minister himself i must
needs look one girl is white muslin from the waist upward and black
silk downward to her slippers a second blushes from top-knot to
shoe-tie one universal scarlet another shines of a pervading yellow
as if she had made a garment of the sunshine the greater part
however have adopted a milder cheerfulness of hue their veils
especially when the wind raises them give a lightness to the general
effect and make them appear like airy phantoms as they flit up the
steps and vanish into the sombre doorway nearly all though it is
very strange that i should know it wear white stockings white as
snow and neat slippers laced crosswise with black ribbon pretty high
above the ankles a white stocking is infinitely more effective than a
black one

here comes the clergyman slow and solemn in severe simplicity
needing no black silk gown to denote his office his aspect claims my
reverence but cannot win my love were i to picture saint peter
keeping fast the gate of heaven and frowning more stern than pitiful
on the wretched applicants that face should be my study by middle
age or sooner the creed has generally wrought upon the heart or been
attempered by it as the minister passes into the church the bell
holds its iron tongue and all the low murmur of the congregation dies
away the gray sexton looks up and down the street and then at my
window-curtain where through the small peephole i half fancy that he
has caught my eye now every loiterer has gone in and the street lies
asleep in the quiet sun while a feeling of loneliness comes over me
and brings also an uneasy sense of neglected privileges and duties
oh i ought to have gone to church the bustle of the rising
congregation reaches my ears they are standing up to pray could i
bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church
and lift it heavenward with a fervor of supplication but no distinct
request would not that be the safest kind of prayer lord look
down upon me in mercy with that sentiment gushing from my soul
might i not leave all the rest to him

hark the hymn this at least is a portion of the service which i
can enjoy better than if i sat within the walls where the full choir
and the massive melody of the organ would fall with a weight upon me
at this distance it thrills through my frame and plays upon my
heart-strings with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit heaven be
praised i know nothing of music as a science and the most elaborate
harmonies if they please me please as simply as a nurse's lullaby
the strain has ceased but prolongs itself in my mind with fanciful
echoes till i start from my reverie and find that the sermon has
commenced it is my misfortune seldom to fructify in a regular way by
any but printed sermons the first strong idea which the preacher
utters gives birth to a train of thought and leads me onward step by
step quite out of hearing of the good man's voice unless he be indeed
a son of thunder at my open window catching now and then a sentence
of the parson's saw i am as well situated as at the foot of the
pulpit stairs the broken and scattered fragments of this one
discourse will be the texts of many sermons preached by those
colleague pastors colleagues but often disputants my mind and
heart the former pretends to be a scholar and perplexes me with
doctrinal points the latter takes me on the score of feeling and
both like several other preachers spend their strength to very
little purpose i their sole auditor cannot always understand them

suppose that a few hours have passed and behold me still behind my
curtain just before the close of the afternoon service the hour-hand
on the dial has passed beyond four o'clock the declining sun is
hidden behind the steeple and throws its shadow straight across the
street so that my chamber is darkened as with a cloud around the
church door all is solitude and an impenetrable obscurity beyond the
threshold a commotion is heard the seats are slammed down and the
pew doors thrown back a multitude of feet are trampling along the
unseen aisles and the congregation bursts suddenly through the
portal foremost scampers a rabble of boys behind whom moves a dense
and dark phalanx of grown men and lastly a crowd of females with
young children and a few scattered husbands this instantaneous
outbreak of life into loneliness is one of the pleasantest scenes of
the day some of the good people are rubbing their eyes thereby
intimating that they have been wrapped as it were in a sort of holy
trance by the fervor of their devotion there is a young man a
third-rate coxcomb whose first care is always to flourish a white
handkerchief and brush the seat of a tight pair of black silk
pantaloons which shine as if varnished they must have been made of
the stuff called everlasting or perhaps of the same piece as
christian's garments in the pilgrim's progress for he put them
on two summers ago and has not yet worn the gloss off i have taken a
great liking to those black silk pantaloons but now with nods and
greetings among friends each matron takes her husband's arm and paces
gravely homeward while the girls also flutter away after arranging
sunset walks with their favored bachelors the sabbath eve is the eve
of love at length the whole congregation is dispersed no here with
faces as glossy as black satin come two sable ladies and a sable
gentleman and close in their rear the minister who softens his
severe visage and bestows a kind word on each poor souls to them the
most captivating picture of bliss in heaven is there we shall be
white

all is solitude again but hark a broken warbling of voices and now
attuning its grandeur to their sweetness a stately peal of the organ
who are the choristers let me dream that the angels who came down
from heaven this blessed morn to blend themselves with the worship of
the truly good are playing and singing their farewell to the earth on
the wings of that rich melody they were borne upward

this gentle reader is merely a flight of poetry a few of the
singing-men and singing-women had lingered behind their fellows and
raised their voices fitfully and blew a careless note upon the organ
yet it lifted my soul higher than all their former strains they are
gone the sons and daughters of music and the gray sexton is just
closing the portal for six days more there will be no face of man in
the pews and aisles and galleries nor a voice in the pulpit nor
music in the choir was it worth while to rear this massive edifice to
be a desert in the heart of the town and populous only for a few hours
of each seventh day oh but the church is a symbol of religion may
its site which was consecrated on the day when the first tree was
felled be kept holy for ever a spot of solitude and peace amid the
trouble and vanity of our week-day world there is a moral and a
religion too even in the silent walls and may the steeple still
point heavenward and be decked with the hallowed sunshine of the
sabbath morn




the wedding-knell


there is a certain church in the city of new york which i have always
regarded with peculiar interest on account of a marriage there
solemnized under very singular circumstances in my grandmother's
girlhood that venerable lady chanced to be a spectator of the scene
and ever after made it her favorite narrative whether the edifice now
standing on the same site be the identical one to which she referred i
am not antiquarian enough to know nor would it be worth while to
correct myself perhaps of an agreeable error by reading the date of
its erection on the tablet over the door it is a stately church
surrounded by an enclosure of the loveliest green within which appear
urns pillars obelisks and other forms of monumental marble the
tributes of private affection or more splendid memorials of historic
dust with such a place though the tumult of the city rolls beneath
its tower one would be willing to connect some legendary interest

the marriage might be considered as the result of an early engagement
though there had been two intermediate weddings on the lady's part and
forty years of celibacy on that of the gentleman at sixty-five mr
ellenwood was a shy but not quite a secluded man selfish like all
men who brood over their own hearts yet manifesting on rare occasions
a vein of generous sentiment a scholar throughout life though always
an indolent one because his studies had no definite object either of
public advantage or personal ambition a gentleman high-bred and
fastidiously delicate yet sometimes requiring a considerable
relaxation in his behalf of the common rules of society in truth
there were so many anomalies in his character and though shrinking
with diseased sensibility from public notice it had been his fatality
so often to become the topic of the day by some wild eccentricity of
conduct that people searched his lineage for a hereditary taint of
insanity but there was no need of this his caprices had their origin
in a mind that lacked the support of an engrossing purpose and in
feelings that preyed upon themselves for want of other food if he
were mad it was the consequence and not the cause of an aimless and
abortive life

the widow was as complete a contrast to her third bridegroom in
everything but age as can well be conceived compelled to relinquish
her first engagement she had been united to a man of twice her own
years to whom she became an exemplary wife and by whose death she
was left in possession of a splendid fortune a southern gentleman
considerably younger than herself succeeded to her hand and carried
her to charleston where after many uncomfortable years she found
herself again a widow it would have been singular if any uncommon
delicacy of feeling had survived through such a life as mrs dabney's
it could not but be crushed and killed by her early disappointment
the cold duty of her first marriage the dislocation of the heart's
principles consequent on a second union and the unkindness of her
southern husband which had inevitably driven her to connect the idea
of his death with that of her comfort to be brief she was that
wisest but unloveliest variety of woman a philosopher bearing
troubles of the heart with equanimity dispensing with all that should
have been her happiness and making the best of what remained sage in
most matters the widow was perhaps the more amiable for the one
frailty that made her ridiculous being childless she could not
remain beautiful by proxy in the person of a daughter she therefore
refused to grow old and ugly on any consideration she struggled with
time and held fast her roses in spite of him till the venerable
thief appeared to have relinquished the spoil as not worth the trouble
of acquiring it

the approaching marriage of this woman of the world with such an
unworldly man as mr ellenwood was announced soon after mrs dabney's
return to her native city superficial observers and deeper ones
seemed to concur in supposing that the lady must have borne no
inactive part in arranging the affair there were considerations of
expediency which she would be far more likely to appreciate than mr
ellenwood and there was just the specious phantom of sentiment and
romance in this late union of two early lovers which sometimes makes a
fool of a woman who has lost her true feelings among the accidents of
life all the wonder was how the gentleman with his lack of worldly
wisdom and agonizing consciousness of ridicule could have been
induced to take a measure at once so prudent and so laughable but
while people talked the wedding-day arrived the ceremony was to be
solemnized according to the episcopalian forms and in open church
with a degree of publicity that attracted many spectators who
occupied the front seats of the galleries and the pews near the altar
and along the broad aisle it had been arranged or possibly it was
the custom of the day that the parties should proceed separately to
church by some accident the bridegroom was a little less punctual
than the widow and her bridal attendants with whose arrival after
this tedious but necessary preface the action of our tale may be said
to commence

the clumsy wheels of several old-fashioned coaches were heard and the
gentlemen and ladies composing the bridal-party came through the
church door with the sudden and gladsome effect of a burst of
sunshine the whole group except the principal figure was made up of
youth and gayety as they streamed up the broad aisle while the pews
and pillars seemed to brighten on either side their steps were as
buoyant as if they mistook the church for a ball-room and were ready
to dance hand in hand to the altar so brilliant was the spectacle
that few took notice of a singular phenomenon that had marked its
entrance at the moment when the bride's foot touched the threshold
the bell swung heavily in the tower above her and sent forth its
deepest knell the vibrations died away and returned with prolonged
solemnity as she entered the body of the church

good heavens what an omen whispered a young lady to her lover

on my honor replied the gentleman i believe the bell has the good
taste to toll of its own accord what has she to do with weddings if
you dearest julia were approaching the altar the bell would ring
out its merriest peal it has only a funeral-knell for her

the bride and most of her company had been too much occupied with the
bustle of entrance to hear the first boding stroke of the bell or at
least to reflect on the singularity of such a welcome to the altar
they therefore continued to advance with undiminished gayety the
gorgeous dresses of the time the crimson velvet coats the gold-laced
hats the hoop-petticoats the silk satin brocade and embroidery
the buckles canes and swords all displayed to the best advantage on
persons suited to such finery made the group appear more like a
bright-colored picture than anything real but by what perversity of
taste had the artist represented his principal figure as so wrinkled
and decayed while yet he had decked her out in the brightest splendor
of attire as if the loveliest maiden had suddenly withered into age
and become a moral to the beautiful around her on they went however
and had glittered along about a third of the aisle when another
stroke of the bell seemed to fill the church with a visible gloom
dimming and obscuring the bright-pageant till it shone forth again as
from a mist

this time the party wavered stopped and huddled closer together
while a slight scream was heard from some of the ladies and a confused
whispering among the gentlemen thus tossing to and fro they might
have been fancifully compared to a splendid bunch of flowers suddenly
shaken by a puff of wind which threatened to scatter the leaves of an
old brown withered rose on the same stalk with two dewy buds such
being the emblem of the widow between her fair young bridemaids but
her heroism was admirable she had started with an irrepressible
shudder as if the stroke of the bell had fallen directly on her
heart then recovering herself while her attendants were yet in
dismay she took the lead and paced calmly up the aisle the bell
continued to swing strike and vibrate with the same doleful
regularity as when a corpse is on its way to the tomb

my young friends here have their nerves a little shaken said the
widow with a smile to the clergyman at the altar but so many
weddings have been ushered in with the merriest peal of the bells and
yet turned out unhappily that i shall hope for better fortune under
such different auspices

madam answered the rector in great perplexity this strange
occurrence brings to my mind a marriage-sermon of the famous bishop
taylor wherein he mingles so many thoughts of mortality and future woe
that to speak somewhat after his own rich style he seems to hang the
bridal-chamber in black and cut the wedding-garment out of a
coffin-pall and it has been the custom of divers nations to infuse
something of sadness into their marriage ceremonies so to keep death
in mind while contracting that engagement which is life's chiefest
business thus we may draw a sad but profitable moral from this
funeral-knell

but though the clergyman might have given his moral even a keener
point he did not fail to despatch an attendant to inquire into the
mystery and stop those sounds so dismally appropriate to such a
marriage a brief space elapsed during which the silence was broken
only by whispers and a few suppressed titterings among the
wedding-party and the spectators who after the first shock were
disposed to draw an ill-natured merriment from the affair the young
have less charity for aged follies than the old for those of youth
the widow's glance was observed to wander for an instant toward a
window of the church as if searching for the time-worn marble that
she had dedicated to her first husband then her eyelids dropped over
their faded orbs and her thoughts were drawn irresistibly to another
grave two buried men with a voice at her ear and a cry afar off were
calling her to lie down beside them perhaps with momentary truth of
feeling she thought how much happier had been her fate if after
years of bliss the bell were now tolling for her funeral and she were
followed to the grave by the old affection of her earliest lover long
her husband but why had she returned to him when their cold hearts
shrank from each other's embrace

still the death-bell tolled so mournfully that the sunshine seemed to
fade in the air a whisper communicated from those who stood nearest
the windows now spread through the church a hearse with a train of
several coaches was creeping along the street conveying some dead man
to the churchyard while the bride awaited a living one at the altar
immediately after the footsteps of the bridegroom and his friends
were heard at the door the widow looked down the aisle and clenched
the arm of one of her bridemaids in her bony hand with such
unconscious violence that the fair girl trembled

you frighten me my dear madam cried she for heaven's sake what
is the matter

nothing my dear nothing said the widow then whispering close to
her ear there is a foolish fancy that i cannot get rid of i am
expecting my bridegroom to come into the church with my two first
husbands for groomsmen

look look screamed the bridemaid what is here the funeral

as she spoke a dark procession paced into the church first came an
old man and woman like chief mourners at a funeral attired from head
to foot in the deepest black all but their pale features and hoary
hair he leaning on a staff and supporting her decrepit form with his
nerveless arm behind appeared another and another pair as aged as
black and mournful as the first as they drew near the widow
recognized in every face some trait of former friends long forgotten
but now returning as if from their old graves to warn her to prepare a
shroud or with purpose almost as unwelcome to exhibit their
wrinkles and infirmity and claim her as their companion by the tokens
of her own decay many a merry night had she danced with them in
youth and now in joyless age she felt that some withered partner
should request her hand and all unite in a dance of death to the music
of the funeral-bell

while these aged mourners were passing up the aisle it was observed
that from pew to pew the spectators shuddered with irrepressible awe
as some object hitherto concealed by the intervening figures came full
in sight many turned away their faces others kept a fixed and rigid
stare and a young girl giggled hysterically and fainted with the
laughter on her lips when the spectral procession approached the
altar each couple separated and slowly diverged till in the centre
appeared a form that had been worthily ushered in with all this gloomy
pomp the death-knell and the funeral it was the bridegroom in his
shroud

no garb but that of the grave could have befitted such a death-like
aspect the eyes indeed had the wild gleam of a sepulchral lamp all
else was fixed in the stern calmness which old men wear in the coffin
the corpse stood motionless but addressed the widow in accents that
seemed to melt into the clang of the bell which fell heavily on the
air while he spoke

come my bride said those pale lips the hearse is ready the
sexton stands waiting for us at the door of the tomb let us be
married and then to our coffins

how shall the widow's horror be represented it gave her the
ghastliness of a dead man's bride her youthful friends stood apart
shuddering at the mourners the shrouded bridegroom and herself the
whole scene expressed by the strongest imagery the vain struggle of
the gilded vanities of this world when opposed to age infirmity
sorrow and death

the awestruck silence was first broken by the clergyman

mr ellenwood said he soothingly yet with somewhat of authority
you are not well your mind has been agitated by the unusual
circumstances in which you are placed the ceremony must be deferred
as an old friend let me entreat you to return home

home yes but not without my bride answered he in the same hollow
accents you deem this mockery perhaps madness had i bedizened my
aged and broken frame with scarlet and embroidery had i forced my
withered lips to smile at my dead heart that might have been mockery
or madness but now let young and old declare which of us has come
hither without a wedding-garment the bridegroom or the bride

he stepped forward at a ghostly pace and stood beside the widow
contrasting the awful simplicity of his shroud with the glare and
glitter in which she had arrayed herself for this unhappy scene none
that beheld them could deny the terrible strength of the moral which
his disordered intellect had contrived to draw

cruel cruel groaned the heartstricken bride

cruel repeated he then losing his deathlike composure in a wild
bitterness heaven judge which of us has been cruel to the other in
youth you deprived me of my happiness my hopes my aims you took
away all the substance of my life and made it a dream without reality
enough even to grieve at with only a pervading gloom through which i
walked wearily and cared not whither but after forty years when i
have built my tomb and would not give up the thought of resting
there no not for such a life as we once pictured you call me to the
altar at your summons i am here but other husbands have enjoyed your
youth your beauty your warmth of heart and all that could be termed
your life what is there for me but your decay and death and
therefore i have bidden these funeral-friends and bespoken the
sexton's deepest knell and am come in my shroud to wed you as with a
burial-service that we may join our hands at the door of the
sepulchre and enter it together

it was not frenzy it was not merely the drunkenness of strong emotion
in a heart unused to it that now wrought upon the bride the stern
lesson of the day had done its work her worldliness was gone she
seized the bridegroom's hand

yes cried she let us wed even at the door of the sepulchre my
life is gone in vanity and emptiness but at its close there is one
true feeling it has made me what i was in youth it makes me worthy
of you time is no more for both of us let us wed for eternity

with a long and deep regard the bridegroom looked into her eyes while
a tear was gathering in his own how strange that gush of human
feeling from the frozen bosom of a corpse he wiped away the tear
even with his shroud

beloved of my youth said he i have been wild the despair of my
whole lifetime had returned at once and maddened me forgive and be
forgiven yes it is evening with us now and we have realized none of
our morning dreams of happiness but let us join our hands before the
altar as lovers whom adverse circumstances have separated through
life yet who meet again as they are leaving it and find their earthly
affection changed into something holy as religion and what is time to
the married of eternity

amid the tears of many and a swell of exalted sentiment in those who
felt aright was solemnized the union of two immortal souls the train
of withered mourners the hoary bridegroom in his shroud the pale
features of the aged bride and the death-bell tolling through the
whole till its deep voice overpowered the marriage-words all marked
the funeral of earthly hopes but as the ceremony proceeded the
organ as if stirred by the sympathies of this impressive scene
poured forth an anthem first mingling with the dismal knell then
rising to a loftier strain till the soul looked down upon its woe
and when the awful rite was finished and with cold hand in cold hand
the married of eternity withdrew the organ's peal of solemn triumph
drowned the wedding-knell




the minister's black veil

a parable


the sexton stood in the porch of milford meeting-house pulling lustily
at the bell-rope the old people of the village came stooping along
the street children with bright faces tripped merrily beside their
parents or mimicked a graver gait in the conscious dignity of their
sunday clothes spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty
maidens and fancied that the sabbath sunshine made them prettier than
on week-days when the throng had mostly streamed into the porch the
sexton began to toll the bell keeping his eye on the reverend mr
hooper's door the first glimpse of the clergyman's figure was the
signal for the bell to cease its summons

footnote another clergyman in new england mr joseph moody of
york maine who died about eighty years since made himself
remarkable by the same eccentricity that is here related of the
reverend mr hooper in his case however the symbol had a different
import in early life he had accidentally killed a beloved friend and
from that day till the hour of his own death he hid his face from
men

but what has good parson hooper got upon his face cried the sexton
in astonishment

all within hearing immediately turned about and beheld the semblance
of mr hooper pacing slowly his meditative way toward the
meeting-house with one accord they started expressing more wonder
than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of mr
hooper's pulpit

are you sure it is our parson inquired goodman gray of the sexton

of a certainty it is good mr hooper replied the sexton he was to
have exchanged pulpits with parson shute of westbury but parson shute
sent to excuse himself yesterday being to preach a funeral sermon

the cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight mr
hooper a gentlemanly person of about thirty though still a bachelor
was dressed with due clerical neatness as if a careful wife had
starched his band and brushed the weekly dust from his sunday's garb
there was but one thing remarkable in his appearance swathed about
his forehead and hanging down over his face so low as to be shaken by
his breath mr hooper had on a black veil on a nearer view it seemed
to consist of two folds of crape which entirely concealed his
features except the mouth and chin but probably did not intercept his
sight further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and
inanimate things with this gloomy shade before him good mr hooper
walked onward at a slow and quiet pace stooping somewhat and looking
on the ground as is customary with abstracted men yet nodding kindly
to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meeting-house
steps but so wonder-struck were they that his greeting hardly met
with a return

i can't really feel as if good mr hooper's face was behind that
piece of crape said the sexton

i don't like it muttered an old woman as she hobbled into the
meeting-house he has changed himself into something awful only by
hiding his face

our parson has gone mad cried goodman gray following him across
the threshold

a rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded mr hooper into
the meeting-house and set all the congregation astir few could
refrain from twisting their heads toward the door many stood upright
and turned directly about while several little boys clambered upon
the seats and came down again with a terrible racket there was a
general bustle a rustling of the women's gowns and shuffling of the
men's feet greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should
attend the entrance of the minister but mr hooper appeared not to
notice the perturbation of his people he entered with an almost
noiseless step bent his head mildly to the pews on each side and
bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner a white-haired
great-grandsire who occupied an arm-chair in the centre of the aisle
it was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became
conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor he
seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder till mr hooper
had ascended the stairs and showed himself in the pulpit face to face
with his congregation except for the black veil that mysterious
emblem was never once withdrawn it shook with his measured breath as
he gave out the psalm it threw its obscurity between him and the holy
page as he read the scriptures and while he prayed the veil lay
heavily on his uplifted countenance did he seek to hide it from the
dread being whom he was addressing

such was the effect of this simple piece of crape that more than one
woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meeting-house yet
perhaps the pale-faced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to
the minister as his black veil to them

mr hooper had the reputation of a good preacher but not an energetic
one he strove to win his people heavenward by mild persuasive
influences rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the
word the sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same
characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his
pulpit oratory but there was something either in the sentiment of the
discourse itself or in the imagination of the auditors which made it
greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their
pastor's lips it was tinged rather more darkly than usual with the
gentle gloom of mr hooper's temperament the subject had reference to
secret sin and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and
dearest and would fain conceal from our own consciousness even
forgetting that the omniscient can detect them a subtle power was
breathed into his words each member of the congregation the most
innocent girl and the man of hardened breast felt as if the preacher
had crept upon them behind his awful veil and discovered their hoarded
iniquity of deed or thought many spread their clasped hands on their
bosoms there was nothing terrible in what mr hooper said at least
no violence and yet with every tremor of his melancholy voice the
hearers quaked an unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe so
sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their
minister that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil
almost believing that a stranger's visage would be discovered though
the form gesture and voice were those of mr hooper

at the close of the services the people hurried out with indecorous
confusion eager to communicate their pent-up amazement and conscious
of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil some
gathered in little circles huddled closely together with their
mouths all whispering in the centre some went homeward alone wrapped
in silent meditation some talked loudly and profaned the sabbath-day
with ostentatious laughter a few shook their sagacious heads
intimating that they could penetrate the mystery while one or two
affirmed that there was no mystery at all but only that mr hooper's
eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp as to require a shade

after a brief interval forth came good mr hooper also in the rear of
his flock turning his veiled face from one group to another he paid
due reverence to the hoary heads saluted the middle-aged with kind
dignity as their friend and spiritual guide greeted the young with
mingled authority and love and laid his hands on the little
children's heads to bless them such was always his custom on the
sabbath-day strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy
none as on former occasions aspired to the honor of walking by their
pastor's side old squire saunders doubtless by an accidental lapse
of memory neglected to invite mr hooper to his table where the good
clergyman had been wont to bless the food almost every sunday since
his settlement he returned therefore to the parsonage and at the
moment of closing the door was observed to look back upon the people
all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister a sad smile
gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil and flickered about his
mouth glimmering as he disappeared

how strange said a lady that a simple black veil such as any
woman might wear on her bonnet should become such a terrible thing on
mr hooper's face

something must surely be amiss with mr hooper's intellects
observed her husband the physician of the village but the strangest
part of the affair is the effect of this vagary even on a sober-minded
man like myself the black veil though it covers only our pastor's
face throws its influence over his whole person and makes him
ghost-like from head to foot do you not feel it so

truly do i replied the lady and i would not be alone with him for
the world i wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself

men sometimes are so said her husband

the afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances at its
conclusion the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady the
relatives and friends were assembled in the house and the more distant
acquaintances stood about the door speaking of the good qualities of
the deceased when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of mr
hooper still covered with his black veil it was now an appropriate
emblem the clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid
and bent over the coffin to take a last farewell of his deceased
parishioner as he stooped the veil hung straight down from his
forehead so that if her eye-lids had not been closed for ever the
dead maiden might have seen his face could mr hooper be fearful of
her glance that he so hastily caught back the black veil a person
who watched the interview between the dead and living scrupled not to
affirm that at the instant when the clergyman's features were
disclosed the corpse had slightly shuddered rustling the shroud and
muslin cap though the countenance retained the composure of death a
superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy

from the coffin mr hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners
and thence to the head of the staircase to make the funeral prayer
it was a tender and heart-dissolving prayer full of sorrow yet so
imbued with celestial hopes that the music of a heavenly harp swept by
the fingers of the dead seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest
accents of the minister the people trembled though they but darkly
understood him when he prayed that they and himself and all of
mortal race might be ready as he trusted this young maiden had been
for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces
the bearers went heavily forth and the mourners followed saddening
all the street with the dead before them and mr hooper in his black
veil behind

why do you look back said one in the procession to his partner

i had a fancy replied she that the minister and the maiden's
spirit were walking hand in hand

and so had i at the same moment said the other

that night the handsomest couple in milford village were to be joined
in wedlock though reckoned a melancholy man mr hooper had a placid
cheerfulness for such occasions which often excited a sympathetic
smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away there was
no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this
the company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience
trusting that the strange awe which had gathered over him throughout
the day would now be dispelled but such was not the result when mr
hooper came the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same
horrible black veil which had added deeper gloom to the funeral and
could portend nothing but evil to the wedding such was its immediate
effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from
beneath the black crape and dimmed the light of the candles the
bridal pair stood up before the minister but the bride's cold fingers
quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom and her death-like
paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few
hours before was come from her grave to be married if ever another
wedding were so dismal it was that famous one where they tolled the
wedding-knell

after performing the ceremony mr hooper raised a glass of wine to his
lips wishing happiness to the new-married couple in a strain of mild
pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests
like a cheerful gleam from the hearth at that instant catching a
glimpse of his figure in the looking-glass the black veil involved
his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others his
frame shuddered his lips grew white he spilt the untasted wine upon
the carpet and rushed forth into the darkness for the earth too had
on her black veil

the next day the whole village of milford talked of little else than
parson hooper's black veil that and the mystery concealed behind it
supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the
street and good women gossipping at their open windows it was the
first item of news that the tavernkeeper told to his guests the
children babbled of it on their way to school one imitative little
imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief thereby so
affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself and he
wellnigh lost his wits by his own waggery

it was remarkable that of all the busybodies and impertinent people
in the parish not one ventured to put the plain question to mr
hooper wherefore he did this thing hitherto whenever there appeared
the slightest call for such interference he had never lacked advisers
nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment if he erred
at all it was by so painful a degree of self-distrust that even the
mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a
crime yet though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness no
individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a
subject of friendly remonstrance there was a feeling of dread
neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed which caused each
to shift the responsibility upon another till at length it was found
expedient to send a deputation of the church in order to deal with
mr hooper about the mystery before it should grow into a scandal
never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties the minister
received them with friendly courtesy but became silent after they
were seated leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing
their important business the topic it might be supposed was obvious
enough there was the black veil swathed round mr hooper's forehead
and concealing every feature above his placid mouth on which at
times they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile but
that piece of crape to their imagination seemed to hang down before
his heart the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them were
the veil but cast aside they might speak freely of it but not till
then thus they sat a considerable time speechless confused and
shrinking uneasily from mr hooper's eye which they felt to be fixed
upon them with an invisible glance finally the deputies returned
abashed to their constituents pronouncing the matter too weighty to
be handled except by a council of the churches if indeed it might
not require a general synod

but there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with
which the black veil had impressed all besides herself when the
deputies returned without an explanation or even venturing to demand
one she with the calm energy of her character determined to chase
away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round mr hooper
every moment more darkly than before as his plighted wife it should
be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed at the
minister's first visit therefore she entered upon the subject with a
direct simplicity which made the task easier both for him and her
after he had seated himself she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the
veil but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so
overawed the multitude it was but a double fold of crape hanging down
from his forehead to his mouth and slightly stirring with his breath

no said she aloud and smiling there is nothing terrible in this
piece of crape except that it hides a face which i am always glad to
look upon come good sir let the sun shine from behind the cloud
first lay aside your black veil then tell me why you put it on

mr hooper's smile glimmered faintly

there is an hour to come said he when all of us shall cast aside
our veils take it not amiss beloved friend if i wear this piece of
crape till then

your words are a mystery too returned the young lady take away
the veil from them at least

elizabeth i will said he so far as my vow may suffer me know
then this veil is a type and a symbol and i am bound to wear it
ever both in light and darkness in solitude and before the gaze of
multitudes and as with strangers so with my familiar friends no
mortal eye will see it withdrawn this dismal shade must separate me
from the world even you elizabeth can never come behind it

what grievous affliction hath befallen you she earnestly inquired
that you should thus darken your eyes for ever

if it be a sign of mourning replied mr hooper i perhaps like
most other mortals have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black
veil

but what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an
innocent sorrow urged elizabeth beloved and respected as you are
there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness
of secret sin for the sake of your holy office do away this scandal

the color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the
rumors that were already abroad in the village but mr hooper's
mildness did not forsake him he even smiled again that same sad
smile which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light
proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil

if i hide my face for sorrow there is cause enough he merely
replied and if i cover it for secret sin what mortal might not do
the same and with this gentle but unconquerable obstinacy did he
resist all her entreaties

at length elizabeth sat silent for a few moments she appeared lost in
thought considering probably what new methods might be tried to
withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy which if it had no other
meaning was perhaps a symptom of mental disease though of a firmer
character than his own the tears rolled down her cheeks but in an
instant as it were a new feeling took the place of sorrow her eyes
were fixed insensibly on the black veil when like a sudden twilight
in the air its terrors fell around her she arose and stood trembling
before him

and do you feel it then at last said he mournfully

she made no reply but covered her eyes with her hand and turned to
leave the room he rushed forward and caught her arm

have patience with me elizabeth cried he passionately do not
desert me though this veil must be between us here on earth be mine
and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face no darkness between
our souls it is but a mortal veil it is not for eternity oh you
know not how lonely i am and how frightened to be alone behind my
black veil do not leave me in this miserable obscurity for ever

lift the veil but once and look me in the face said she

never it cannot be replied mr hooper

then farewell said elizabeth

she withdrew her arm from his grasp and slowly departed pausing at
the door to give one long shuddering gaze that seemed almost to
penetrate the mystery of the black veil but even amid his grief mr
hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him
from happiness though the horrors which it shadowed forth must be
drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers

from that time no attempts were made to remove mr hooper's black veil
or by a direct appeal to discover the secret which it was supposed to
hide by persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice it was
reckoned merely an eccentric whim such as often mingles with the
sober actions of men otherwise rational and tinges them all with its
own semblance of insanity but with the multitude good mr hooper was
irreparably a bugbear he could not walk the street with any peace of
mind so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside
to avoid him and that others would make it a point of hardihood to
throw themselves in his way the impertinence of the latter class
compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the
burial-ground for when he leaned pensively over the gate there would
always be faces behind the gravestones peeping at his black veil a
fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him
thence it grieved him to the very depth of his kind heart to observe
how the children fled from his approach breaking up their merriest
sports while his melancholy figure was yet afar off their instinctive
dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else that a
preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black
crape in truth his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so
great that he never willingly passed before a mirror nor stooped to
drink at a still fountain lest in its peaceful bosom he should be
affrighted by himself this was what gave plausibility to the whispers
that mr hooper's conscience tortured him for some great crime too
horrible to be entirely concealed or otherwise than so obscurely
intimated thus from beneath the black veil there rolled a cloud into
the sunshine an ambiguity of sin or sorrow which enveloped the poor
minister so that love or sympathy could never reach him it was said
that ghost and fiend consorted with him there with self-shudderings
and outward terrors he walked continually in its shadow groping
darkly within his own soul or gazing through a medium that saddened
the whole world even the lawless wind it was believed respected his
dreadful secret and never blew aside the veil but still good mr
hooper sadly smiled at the pale visages of the worldly throng as he
passed by

among all its bad influences the black veil had the one desirable
effect of making its wearer a very efficient clergyman by the aid of
his mysterious emblem for there was no other apparent cause he
became a man of awful power over souls that were in agony for sin his
converts always regarded him with a dread peculiar to themselves
affirming though but figuratively that before he brought them to
celestial light they had been with him behind the black veil its
gloom indeed enabled him to sympathize with all dark affections
dying sinners cried aloud for mr hooper and would not yield their
breath till he appeared though ever as he stooped to whisper
consolation they shuddered at the veiled face so near their own such
were the terrors of the black veil even when death had bared his
visage strangers came long distances to attend service at his church
with the mere idle purpose of gazing at his figure because it was
forbidden them to behold his face but many were made to quake ere
they departed once during governor belcher's administration mr
hooper was appointed to preach the election sermon covered with his
black veil he stood before the chief magistrate the council and the
representatives and wrought so deep an impression that the
legislative measures of that year were characterized by all the gloom
and piety of our earliest ancestral sway

in this manner mr hooper spent a long life irreproachable in outward
act yet shrouded in dismal suspicions kind and loving though
unloved and dimly feared a man apart from men shunned in their
health and joy but ever summoned to their aid in mortal anguish as
years wore on shedding their snows above his sable veil he acquired
a name throughout the new england churches and they called him father
hooper nearly all his parishioners who were of mature age when he was
settled had been borne away by many a funeral he had one congregation
in the church and a more crowded one in the churchyard and having
wrought so late into the evening and done his work so well it was now
good father hooper's turn to rest

several persons were visible by the shaded candlelight in the
death-chamber of the old clergyman natural connections he had none
but there was the decorously grave though unmoved physician seeking
only to mitigate the last pangs of the patient whom he could not save
there were the deacons and other eminently pious members of his
church there also was the reverend mr clark of westbury a young
and zealous divine who had ridden in haste to pray by the bedside of
the expiring minister there was the nurse no hired handmaiden of
death but one whose calm affection had endured thus long in secrecy
in solitude amid the chill of age and would not perish even at the
dying-hour who but elizabeth and there lay the hoary head of good
father hooper upon the death-pillow with the black veil still swathed
about his brow and reaching down over his face so that each more
difficult gasp of his faint breath caused it to stir all through life
that piece of crape had hung between him and the world it had
separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love and kept him
in that saddest of all prisons his own heart and still it lay upon
his face as if to deepen the gloom of his darksome chamber and shade
him from the sunshine of eternity

for some time previous his mind had been confused wavering doubtfully
between the past and the present and hovering forward as it were at
intervals into the indistinctness of the world to come there had
been feverish turns which tossed him from side to side and wore away
what little strength he had but in his most convulsive struggles and
in the wildest vagaries of his intellect when no other thought
retained its sober influence he still showed an awful solicitude lest
the black veil should slip aside even if his bewildered soul could
have forgotten there was a faithful woman at his pillow who with
averted eyes would have covered that aged face which she had last
beheld in the comeliness of manhood

at length the death-stricken old man lay quietly in the torpor of
mental and bodily exhaustion with an imperceptible pulse and breath
that grew fainter and fainter except when a long deep and irregular
inspiration seemed to prelude the flight of his spirit

the minister of westbury approached the bedside

venerable father hooper said he the moment of your release is at
hand are you ready for the lifting of the veil that shuts in time
from eternity

father hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head
then apprehensive perhaps that his meaning might be doubtful he
exerted himself to speak

yea said he in faint accents my soul hath a patient weariness
until that veil be lifted

and is it fitting resumed the reverend mr clark that a man so
given to prayer of such a blameless example holy in deed and
thought so far as mortal judgment may pronounce is it fitting that
a father in the church should leave a shadow on his memory that may
seem to blacken a life so pure i pray you my venerable brother let
not this thing be suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect
as you go to your reward before the veil of eternity be lifted let me
cast aside this black veil from your face and thus speaking the
reverend mr clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many
years

but exerting a sudden energy that made all the beholders stand
aghast father hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the
bedclothes and pressed them strongly on the black veil resolute to
struggle if the minister of westbury would contend with a dying man

never cried the veiled clergyman on earth never

dark old man exclaimed the affrighted minister with what horrible
crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment

father hooper's breath heaved it rattled in his throat but with a
mighty effort grasping forward with his hands he caught hold of life
and held it back till he should speak he even raised himself in bed
and there he sat shivering with the arms of death around him while
the black veil hung down awful at that last moment in the gathered
terrors of a lifetime and yet the faint sad smile so often there now
seemed to glimmer from its obscurity and linger on father hooper's
lips

why do you tremble at me alone cried he turning his veiled face
round the circle of pale spectators tremble also at each other have
men avoided me and women shown no pity and children screamed and fled
only for my black veil what but the mystery which it obscurely
typifies has made this piece of crape so awful when the friend shows
his inmost heart to his friend the lover to his best-beloved when
man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his creator loathsomely
treasuring up the secret of his sin then deem me a monster for the
symbol beneath which i have lived and die i look around me and lo
on every visage a black veil

while his auditors shrank from one another in mutual affright father
hooper fell back upon his pillow a veiled corpse with a faint smile
lingering on the lips still veiled they laid him in his coffin and
a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave the grass of many years
has sprung up and withered on that grave the burial-stone is
moss-grown and good mr hooper's face is dust but awful is still the
thought that it mouldered beneath the black veil




the maypole of merry mount


 there is an admirable foundation for a philosophic romance in
 the curious history of the early settlement of mount wollaston
 or merry mount in the slight sketch here attempted the facts
 recorded on the grave pages of our new england annalists have
 wrought themselves almost spontaneously into a sort of allegory
 the masques mummeries and festive customs described in the text
 are in accordance with the manners of the age authority on these
 points may be found in strutt's book of english sports and
 pastimes

bright were the days at merry mount when the maypole was the
banner-staff of that gay colony they who reared it should their
banner be triumphant were to pour sunshine over new england's rugged
hills and scatter flower-seeds throughout the soil jollity and gloom
were contending for an empire midsummer eve had come bringing deep
verdure to the forest and roses in her lap of a more vivid hue than
the tender buds of spring but may or her mirthful spirit dwelt all
the year round at merry mount sporting with the summer months and
revelling with autumn and basking in the glow of winter's fireside
through a world of toil and care she flitted with a dream-like smile
and came hither to find a home among the lightsome hearts of merry
mount

never had the maypole been so gayly decked as at sunset on midsummer
eve this venerated emblem was a pine tree which had preserved the
slender grace of youth while it equalled the loftiest height of the
old wood-monarchs from its top streamed a silken banner colored like
the rainbow down nearly to the ground the pole was dressed with
birchen boughs and others of the liveliest green and some with
silvery leaves fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots
of twenty different colors but no sad ones garden-flowers and
blossoms of the wilderness laughed gladly forth amid the verdure so
fresh and dewy that they must have grown by magic on that happy pine
tree where this green and flowery splendor terminated the shaft of
the maypole was stained with the seven brilliant hues of the banner at
its top on the lowest green bough hung an abundant wreath of
roses some that had been gathered in the sunniest spots of the
forest and others of still richer blush which the colonists had
reared from english seed o people of the golden age the chief of
your husbandry was to raise flowers

but what was the wild throng that stood hand in hand about the
maypole it could not be that the fauns and nymphs when driven from
their classic groves and homes of ancient fable had sought refuge as
all the persecuted did in the fresh woods of the west these were
gothic monsters though perhaps of grecian ancestry on the shoulders
of a comely youth uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag a
second human in all other points had the grim visage of a wolf a
third still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man showed the
beard and horns of a venerable he-goat there was the likeness of a
bear erect brute in all but his hind legs which were adorned with
pink silk stockings and here again almost as wondrous stood a real
bear of the dark forest lending each of his forepaws to the grasp of
a human hand and as ready for the dance as any in that circle his
inferior nature rose halfway to meet his companions as they stooped
other faces wore the similitude of man or woman but distorted or
extravagant with red noses pendulous before their mouths which
seemed of awful depth and stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit
of laughter here might be seen the salvage man well known in
heraldry hairy as a baboon and girdled with green leaves by his
side a nobler figure but still a counterfeit appeared an indian
hunter with feathery crest and wampum-belt many of this strange
company wore foolscaps and had little bells appended to their
garments tinkling with a silvery sound responsive to the inaudible
music of their gleesome spirits some youths and maidens were of
soberer garb yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng
by the expression of wild revelry upon their features

such were the colonists of merry mount as they stood in the broad
smile of sunset round their venerated maypole had a wanderer
bewildered in the melancholy forest heard their mirth and stolen a
half-affrighted glance he might have fancied them the crew of comus
some already transformed to brutes some midway between man and beast
and the others rioting in the flow of tipsy jollity that foreran the
change but a band of puritans who watched the scene invisible
themselves compared the masques to those devils and ruined souls with
whom their superstition peopled the black wilderness

within the ring of monsters appeared the two airiest forms that had
ever trodden on any more solid footing than a purple-and-golden cloud
one was a youth in glistening apparel with a scarf of the rainbow
pattern crosswise on his breast his right hand held a gilded
staff the ensign of high dignity among the revellers and his left
grasped the slender fingers of a fair maiden not less gayly decorated
than himself bright roses glowed in contrast with the dark and glossy
curls of each and were scattered round their feet or had sprung up
spontaneously there behind this lightsome couple so close to the
maypole that its boughs shaded his jovial face stood the figure of an
english priest canonically dressed yet decked with flowers in
heathen fashion and wearing a chaplet of the native vine leaves by
the riot of his rolling eye and the pagan decorations of his holy
garb he seemed the wildest monster there and the very comus of the
crew

votaries of the maypole cried the flower-decked priest merrily
all day long have the woods echoed to your mirth but be this your
merriest hour my hearts lo here stand the lord and lady of the may
whom i a clerk of oxford and high priest of merry mount am presently
to join in holy matrimony up with your nimble spirits ye
morrice-dancers green men and glee-maidens bears and wolves and
horned gentlemen come a chorus now rich with the old mirth of merry
england and the wilder glee of this fresh forest and then a dance to
show the youthful pair what life is made of and how airily they should
go through it all ye that love the maypole lend your voices to the
nuptial song of the lord and lady of the may

this wedlock was more serious than most affairs of merry mount where
jest and delusion trick and fantasy kept up a continual carnival
the lord and lady of the may though their titles must be laid down at
sunset were really and truly to be partners for the dance of life
beginning the measure that same bright eve the wreath of roses that
hung from the lowest green bough of the maypole had been twined for
them and would be thrown over both their heads in symbol of their
flowery union when the priest had spoken therefore a riotous uproar
burst from the rout of monstrous figures

begin you the stave reverend sir cried they all and never did
the woods ring to such a merry peal as we of the maypole shall send
up

immediately a prelude of pipe cittern and viol touched with
practised minstrelsy began to play from a neighboring thicket in such
a mirthful cadence that the boughs of the maypole quivered to the
sound but the may-lord he of the gilded staff chancing to look into
his lady's eyes was wonder-struck at the almost pensive glance that
met his own

edith sweet lady of the may whispered he reproachfully is yon
wreath of roses a garland to hang above our graves that you look so
sad oh edith this is our golden time tarnish it not by any pensive
shadow of the mind for it may be that nothing of futurity will be
brighter than the mere remembrance of what is now passing

that was the very thought that saddened me how came it in your mind
too said edith in a still lower tone than he for it was high
treason to be sad at merry mount therefore do i sigh amid this
festive music and besides dear edgar i struggle as with a dream
and fancy that these shapes of our jovial friends are visionary and
their mirth unreal and that we are no true lord and lady of the may
what is the mystery in my heart

just then as if a spell had loosened them down came a little shower
of withering rose-leaves from the maypole alas for the young lovers
no sooner had their hearts glowed with real passion than they were
sensible of something vague and unsubstantial in their former
pleasures and felt a dreary presentiment of inevitable change from
the moment that they truly loved they had subjected themselves to
earth's doom of care and sorrow and troubled joy and had no more a
home at merry mount that was edith's mystery now leave we the priest
to marry them and the masquers to sport round the maypole till the
last sunbeam be withdrawn from its summit and the shadows of the
forest mingle gloomily in the dance meanwhile we may discover who
these gay people were

two hundred years ago and more the old world and its inhabitants
became mutually weary of each other men voyaged by thousands to the
west some to barter glass and such like jewels for the furs of the
indian hunter some to conquer virgin empires and one stern band to
pray but none of these motives had much weight with the striving to
communicate their mirth to the grave indian or masquerading in the
skins of deer and wolves which they had hunted for that especial
purpose often the whole colony were playing at blindman's buff
magistrates and all with their eyes bandaged except a single
scapegoat whom the blinded sinners pursued by the tinkling of the
bells at his garments once it is said they were seen following a
flower-decked corpse with merriment and festive music to his grave
but did the dead man laugh in their quietest times they sang ballads
and told tales for the edification of their pious visitors or
perplexed them with juggling tricks or grinned at them through
horse-collars and when sport itself grew wearisome they made game of
their own stupidity and began a yawning-match at the very least of
these enormities the men of iron shook their heads and frowned so
darkly that the revellers looked up imagining that a momentary cloud
had overcast the sunshine which was to be perpetual there on the
other hand the puritans affirmed that when a psalm was pealing from
their place of worship the echo which the forest sent them back seemed
often like the chorus of a jolly catch closing with a roar of
laughter who but the fiend and his bond-slaves the crew of merry
mount had thus disturbed them in due time a feud arose stern and
bitter on one side and as serious on the other as anything could be
among such light spirits as had sworn allegiance to the maypole the
future complexion of new england was involved in this important
quarrel should the grisly saints establish their jurisdiction over
the gay sinners then would their spirits darken all the clime and
make it a land of clouded visages of hard toil of sermon and psalm
for ever but should the banner-staff of merry mount be fortunate
sunshine would break upon the hills and flowers would beautify the
forest and late posterity do homage to the maypole

after these authentic passages from history we return to the nuptials
of the lord and lady of the may alas we have delayed too long and
must darken our tale too suddenly as we glance again at the maypole a
solitary sunbeam is fading from the summit and leaves only a faint
golden tinge blended with the hues of the rainbow banner even that
dim light is now withdrawn relinquishing the whole domain of merry
mount to the evening gloom which has rushed so instantaneously from
the black surrounding woods but some of these black shadows have
rushed forth in human shape

yes with the setting sun the last day of mirth had passed from merry
mount the ring of gay masquers was disordered and broken the stag
lowered his antlers in dismay the wolf grew weaker than a lamb the
bells of the morrice-dancers tinkled with tremulous affright the
puritans had played a characteristic part in the maypole mummeries
their darksome figures were intermixed with the wild shapes of their
foes and made the scene a picture of the moment when waking thoughts
start up amid the scattered fantasies of a dream the leader of the
hostile party stood in the centre of the circle while the rout of
monsters cowered around him like evil spirits in the presence of a
dread magician no fantastic foolery could look him in the face so
stern was the energy of his aspect that the whole man visage frame
and soul seemed wrought of iron gifted with life and thought yet all
of one substance with his headpiece and breastplate it was the
puritan of puritans it was endicott himself

stand off priest of baal said he with a grim frown and laying no
reverent hand upon the surplice i know thee blackstone thou art
the man who couldst not abide the rule even of thine own corrupted
church and hast come hither to preach iniquity and to give example of
it in thy life but now shall it be seen that the lord hath sanctified
this wilderness for his peculiar people woe unto them that would
defile it and first for this flower-decked abomination the altar of
thy worship

footnote did governor endicott speak less positively we should
suspect a mistake here the rev mr blackstone though an eccentric
is not known to have been an immoral man we rather doubt his identity
with the priest of merry mount

and with his keen sword endicott assaulted the hallowed maypole nor
long did it resist his arm it groaned with a dismal sound it
showered leaves and rosebuds upon the remorseless enthusiast and
finally with all its green boughs and ribbons and flowers symbolic
of departed pleasures down fell the banner-staff of merry mount as
it sank tradition says the evening sky grew darker and the woods
threw forth a more sombre shadow

there cried endicott looking triumphantly on his work there lies
the only maypole in new england the thought is strong within me that
by its fall is shadowed forth the fate of light and idle mirthmakers
amongst us and our posterity amen saith john endicott

amen echoed his followers

but the votaries of the maypole gave one groan for their idol at the
sound the puritan leader glanced at the crew of comus each a figure
of broad mirth yet at this moment strangely expressive of sorrow and
dismay

valiant captain quoth peter palfrey the ancient of the band what
order shall be taken with the prisoners

i thought not to repent me of cutting down a maypole replied
endicott yet now i could find in my heart to plant it again and give
each of these bestial pagans one other dance round their idol it
would have served rarely for a whipping-post

but there are pine trees enow suggested the lieutenant

true good ancient said the leader wherefore bind the heathen
crew and bestow on them a small matter of stripes apiece as earnest of
our future justice set some of the rogues in the stocks to rest
themselves so soon as providence shall bring us to one of our own
well-ordered settlements where such accommodations may be found
further penalties such as branding and cropping of ears shall be
thought of hereafter

how many stripes for the priest inquired ancient palfrey

none as yet answered endicott bending his iron frown upon the
culprit it must be for the great and general court to determine
whether stripes and long imprisonment and other grievous penalty may
atone for his transgressions let him look to himself for such as
violate our civil order it may be permitted us to show mercy but woe
to the wretch that troubleth our religion

and this dancing bear resumed the officer must he share the
stripes of his fellows

shoot him through the head said the energetic puritan i suspect
witchcraft in the beast

here be a couple of shining ones continued peter palfrey pointing
his weapon at the lord and lady of the may they seem to be of high
station among these misdoers methinks their dignity will not be
fitted with less than a double share of stripes

endicott rested on his sword and closely surveyed the dress and aspect
of the hapless pair there they stood pale downcast and
apprehensive yet there was an air of mutual support and of pure
affection seeking aid and giving it that showed them to be man and
wife with the sanction of a priest upon their love the youth in the
peril of the moment had dropped his gilded staff and thrown his arm
about the lady of the may who leaned against his breast too lightly
to burden him but with weight enough to express that their destinies
were linked together for good or evil they looked first at each other
and then into the grim captain's face there they stood in the first
hour of wedlock while the idle pleasures of which their companions
were the emblems had given place to the sternest cares of life
personified by the dark puritans but never had their youthful beauty
seemed so pure and high as when its glow was chastened by adversity

youth said endicott ye stand in an evil case thou and thy
maiden-wife make ready presently for i am minded that ye shall both
have a token to remember your wedding-day

stern man cried the may-lord how can i move thee were the means
at hand i would resist to the death being powerless i entreat do
with me as thou wilt but let edith go untouched

not so replied the immitigable zealot we are not wont to show an
idle courtesy to that sex which requireth the stricter discipline what
sayest thou maid shall thy silken bridegroom suffer thy share of the
penalty besides his own

be it death said edith and lay it all on me

truly as endicott had said the poor lovers stood in a woeful case
their foes were triumphant their friends captive and abased their
home desolate the benighted wilderness around them and a rigorous
destiny in the shape of the puritan leader their only guide yet the
deepening twilight could not altogether conceal that the iron man was
softened he smiled at the fair spectacle of early love he almost
sighed for the inevitable blight of early hopes

the troubles of life have come hastily on this young couple
observed endicott we will see how they comport themselves under
their present trials ere we burden them with greater if among the
spoil there be any garments of a more decent fashion let them be put
upon this may-lord and his lady instead of their glistening vanities
look to it some of you

and shall not the youth's hair be cut asked peter palfrey looking
with abhorrence at the lovelock and long glossy curls of the young
man

crop it forthwith and that in the true pumpkin-shell fashion
answered the captain then bring them along with us but more gently
than their fellows there be qualities in the youth which may make him
valiant to fight and sober to toil and pious to pray and in the
maiden that may fit her to become a mother in our israel bringing up
babes in better nurture than her own hath been nor think ye young
ones that they are the happiest even in our lifetime of a moment
who misspend it in dancing round a maypole

and endicott the severest puritan of all who laid the rock-foundation
of new england lifted the wreath of roses from the ruin of the
maypole and threw it with his own gauntleted hand over the heads of
the lord and lady of the may it was a deed of prophecy as the moral
gloom of the world overpowers all systematic gayety even so was their
home of wild mirth made desolate amid the sad forest they returned to
it no more but as their flowery garland was wreathed of the brightest
roses that had grown there so in the tie that united them were
intertwined all the purest and best of their early joys they went
heavenward supporting each other along the difficult path which it was
their lot to tread and never wasted one regretful thought on the
vanities of merry mount




the gentle boy


in the course of the year several of the people called
quakers led as they professed by the inward movement of the
spirit made their appearance in new england their reputation as
holders of mystic and pernicious principles having spread before them
the puritans early endeavored to banish and to prevent the further
intrusion of the rising sect but the measures by which it was
intended to purge the land of heresy though more than sufficiently
vigorous were entirely unsuccessful the quakers esteeming
persecution as a divine call to the post of danger laid claim to a
holy courage unknown to the puritans themselves who had shunned the
cross by providing for the peaceable exercise of their religion in a
distant wilderness though it was the singular fact that every nation
of the earth rejected the wandering enthusiasts who practised peace
toward all men the place of greatest uneasiness and peril and
therefore in their eyes the most eligible was the province of
massachusetts bay

the fines imprisonments and stripes liberally distributed by our
pious forefathers the popular antipathy so strong that it endured
nearly a hundred years after actual persecution had ceased were
attractions as powerful for the quakers as peace honor and reward
would have been for the worldly-minded every european vessel brought
new cargoes of the sect eager to testify against the oppression which
they hoped to share and when shipmasters were restrained by heavy
fines from affording them passage they made long and circuitous
journeys through the indian country and appeared in the province as
if conveyed by a supernatural power their enthusiasm heightened
almost to madness by the treatment which they received produced
actions contrary to the rules of decency as well as of rational
religion and presented a singular contrast to the calm and staid
deportment of their sectarian successors of the present day the
command of the spirit inaudible except to the soul and not to be
controverted on grounds of human wisdom was made a plea for most
indecorous exhibitions which abstractedly considered well deserved
the moderate chastisement of the rod these extravagances and the
persecution which was at once their cause and consequence continued
to increase till in the year the government of massachusetts bay
indulged two members of the quaker sect with the crown of martyrdom

an indelible stain of blood is upon the hands of all who consented to
this act but a large share of the awful responsibility must rest upon
the person then at the head of the government he was a man of narrow
mind and imperfect education and his uncompromising bigotry was made
hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passions he exerted his
influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass the death of the
enthusiasts and his whole conduct in respect to them was marked by
brutal cruelty the quakers whose revengeful feelings were not less
deep because they were inactive remembered this man and his
associates in after-times the historian of the sect affirms that by
the wrath of heaven a blight fell upon the land in the vicinity of the
bloody town of boston so that no wheat would grow there and he
takes his stand as it were among the graves of the ancient
persecutors and triumphantly recounts the judgments that overtook
them in old age or at the parting-hour he tells us that they died
suddenly and violently and in madness but nothing can exceed the
bitter mockery with which he records the loathsome disease and death
by rottenness of the fierce and cruel governor

 

on the evening of the autumn day that had witnessed the martyrdom of
two men of the quaker persuasion a puritan settler was returning from
the metropolis to the neighboring country-town in which he resided
the air was cool the sky clear and the lingering twilight was made
brighter by the rays of a young moon which had now nearly reached the
verge of the horizon the traveller a man of middle age wrapped in a
gray frieze cloak quickened his pace when he had reached the
outskirts of the town for a gloomy extent of nearly four miles lay
between him and his home the low straw-thatched houses were scattered
at considerable intervals along the road and the country having been
settled but about thirty years the tracts of original forest still
bore no small proportion to the cultivated ground the autumn wind
wandered among the branches whirling away the leaves from all except
the pine trees and moaning as if it lamented the desolation of which
it was the instrument the road had penetrated the mass of woods that
lay nearest to the town and was just emerging into an open space
when the traveller's ears were saluted by a sound more mournful than
even that of the wind it was like the wailing of some one in
distress and it seemed to proceed from beneath a tall and lonely fir
tree in the centre of a cleared but unenclosed and uncultivated field
the puritan could not but remember that this was the very spot which
had been made accursed a few hours before by the execution of the
quakers whose bodies had been thrown together into one hasty grave
beneath the tree on which they suffered he struggled however
against the superstitious fears which belonged to the age and
compelled himself to pause and listen

the voice is most likely mortal nor have i cause to tremble if it be
otherwise thought he straining his eyes through the dim moonlight
methinks it is like the wailing of a child some infant it may be
which has strayed from its mother and chanced upon this place of
death for the ease of mine own conscience i must search this matter
out he therefore left the path and walked somewhat fearfully across
the field though now so desolate its soil was pressed down and
trampled by the thousand footsteps of those who had witnessed the
spectacle of that day all of whom had now retired leaving the dead
to their loneliness

the traveller at length reached the fir tree which from the middle
upward was covered with living branches although a scaffold had been
erected beneath and other preparations made for the work of death
under this unhappy tree which in after-times was believed to drop
poison with its dew sat the one solitary mourner for innocent blood
it was a slender and light-clad little boy who leaned his face upon a
hillock of fresh-turned and half-frozen earth and wailed bitterly yet
in a suppressed tone as if his grief might receive the punishment of
crime the puritan whose approach had been unperceived laid his hand
upon the child's shoulder and addressed him compassionately

you have chosen a dreary lodging my poor boy and no wonder that you
weep said he but dry your eyes and tell me where your mother
dwells i promise you if the journey be not too far i will leave you
in her arms tonight

the boy had hushed his wailing at once and turned his face upward to
the stranger it was a pale bright-eyed countenance certainly not
more than six years old but sorrow fear and want had destroyed much
of its infantile expression the puritan seeing the boy's frightened
gaze and feeling that he trembled under his hand endeavored to
reassure him

nay if i intended to do you harm little lad the readiest way were
to leave you here what you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on
a new-made grave and yet you tremble at a friend's touch take heart
child and tell me what is your name and where is your home

friend replied the little boy in a sweet though faltering voice
they call me ilbrahim and my home is here

the pale spiritual face the eyes that seemed to mingle with the
moonlight the sweet airy voice and the outlandish name almost made
the puritan believe that the boy was in truth a being which had sprung
up out of the grave on which he sat but perceiving that the
apparition stood the test of a short mental prayer and remembering
that the arm which he had touched was lifelike he adopted a more
rational supposition the poor child is stricken in his intellect
thought he but verily his words are fearful in a place like this
he then spoke soothingly intending to humor the boy's fantasy

your home will scarce be comfortable ilbrahim this cold autumn
night and i fear you are ill-provided with food i am hastening to a
warm supper and bed and if you will go with me you shall share
them

i thank thee friend but though i be hungry and shivering with
cold thou wilt not give me food nor lodging replied the boy in the
quiet tone which despair had taught him even so young my father was
of the people whom all men hate they have laid him under this heap of
earth and here is my home

the puritan who had laid hold of little ilbrahim's hand relinquished
it as if he were touching a loathsome reptile but he possessed a
compassionate heart which not even religious prejudice could harden
into stone god forbid that i should leave this child to perish
though he comes of the accursed sect said he to himself do we not
all spring from an evil root are we not all in darkness till the
light doth shine upon us he shall not perish neither in body nor if
prayer and instruction may avail for him in soul he then spoke
aloud and kindly to ilbrahim who had again hid his face in the cold
earth of the grave

was every door in the land shut against you my child that you have
wandered to this unhallowed spot

they drove me forth from the prison when they took my father thence
said the boy and i stood afar off watching the crowd of people and
when they were gone i came hither and found only this grave i knew
that my father was sleeping here and i said this shall be my
home

no child no not while i have a roof over my head or a morsel to
share with you exclaimed the puritan whose sympathies were now
fully excited rise up and come with me and fear not any harm

the boy wept afresh and clung to the heap of earth as if the cold
heart beneath it were warmer to him than any in a living breast the
traveller however continued to entreat him tenderly and seeming to
acquire some degree of confidence he at length arose but his slender
limbs tottered with weakness his little head grew dizzy and he
leaned against the tree of death for support

my poor boy are you so feeble said the puritan when did you
taste food last

i ate of bread and water with my father in the prison replied
ilbrahim but they brought him none neither yesterday nor to-day
saying that he had eaten enough to bear him to his journey's end
trouble not thyself for my hunger kind friend for i have lacked food
many times ere now

the traveller took the child in his arms and wrapped his cloak about
him while his heart stirred with shame and anger against the
gratuitous cruelty of the instruments in this persecution in the
awakened warmth of his feelings he resolved that at whatever risk he
would not forsake the poor little defenceless being whom heaven had
confided to his care with this determination he left the accursed
field and resumed the homeward path from which the wailing of the boy
had called him the light and motionless burden scarcely impeded his
progress and he soon beheld the fire-rays from the windows of the
cottage which he a native of a distant clime had built in the
western wilderness it was surrounded by a considerable extent of
cultivated ground and the dwelling was situated in the nook of a
wood-covered hill whither it seemed to have crept for protection

look up child said the puritan to ilbrahim whose faint head had
sunk upon his shoulder there is our home

at the word home a thrill passed through the child's frame but he
continued silent a few moments brought them to the cottage door at
which the owner knocked for at that early period when savages were
wandering everywhere among the settlers bolt and bar were
indispensable to the security of a dwelling the summons was answered
by a bond-servant a coarse-clad and dull-featured piece of humanity
who after ascertaining that his master was the applicant undid the
door and held a flaring pine-knot torch to light him in farther back
in the passageway the red blaze discovered a matronly woman but no
little crowd of children came bounding forth to greet their father's
return

as the puritan entered he thrust aside his cloak and displayed
ilbrahim's face to the female

dorothy here is a little outcast whom providence hath put into our
hands observed he be kind to him even as if he were of those dear
ones who have departed from us

what pale and bright-eyed little boy is this tobias she inquired
is he one whom the wilderness-folk have ravished from some christian
mother

no dorothy this poor child is no captive from the wilderness he
replied the heathen savage would have given him to eat of his scanty
morsel and to drink of his birchen cup but christian men alas had
cast him out to die then he told her how he had found him beneath
the gallows upon his father's grave and how his heart had prompted
him like the speaking of an inward voice to take the little outcast
home and be kind unto him he acknowledged his resolution to feed and
clothe him as if he were his own child and to afford him the
instruction which should counteract the pernicious errors hitherto
instilled into his infant mind

dorothy was gifted with even a quicker tenderness than her husband
and she approved of all his doings and intentions

have you a mother dear child she inquired

the tears burst forth from his full heart as he attempted to reply
but dorothy at length understood that he had a mother who like the
rest of her sect was a persecuted wanderer she had been taken from
the prison a short time before carried into the uninhabited
wilderness and left to perish there by hunger or wild beasts this was
no uncommon method of disposing of the quakers and they were
accustomed to boast that the inhabitants of the desert were more
hospitable to them than civilized man

fear not little boy you shall not need a mother and a kind one
said dorothy when she had gathered this information dry your tears
ilbrahim and be my child as i will be your mother

the good woman prepared the little bed from which her own children had
successively been borne to another resting-place before ilbrahim
would consent to occupy it he knelt down and as dorothy listed to his
simple and affecting prayer she marvelled how the parents that had
taught it to him could have been judged worthy of death when the boy
had fallen asleep she bent over his pale and spiritual countenance
pressed a kiss upon his white brow drew the bedclothes up about his
neck and went away with a pensive gladness in her heart

tobias pearson was not among the earliest emigrants from the old
country he had remained in england during the first years of the
civil war in which he had borne some share as a cornet of dragoons
under cromwell but when the ambitious designs of his leader began to
develop themselves he quitted the army of the parliament and sought a
refuge from the strife which was no longer holy among the people of
his persuasion in the colony of massachusetts a more worldly
consideration had perhaps an influence in drawing him thither for new
england offered advantages to men of unprosperous fortunes as well as
to dissatisfied religionists and pearson had hitherto found it
difficult to provide for a wife and increasing family to this
supposed impurity of motive the more bigoted puritans were inclined to
impute the removal by death of all the children for whose earthly good
the father had been over-thoughtful they had left their native
country blooming like roses and like roses they had perished in a
foreign soil those expounders of the ways of providence who had thus
judged their brother and attributed his domestic sorrows to his sin
were not more charitable when they saw him and dorothy endeavoring to
fill up the void in their hearts by the adoption of an infant of the
accursed sect nor did they fail to communicate their disapprobation
to tobias but the latter in reply merely pointed at the little quiet
lovely boy whose appearance and deportment were indeed as powerful
arguments as could possibly have been adduced in his own favor even
his beauty however and his winning manners sometimes produced an
effect ultimately unfavorable for the bigots when the outer surfaces
of their iron hearts had been softened and again grew hard affirmed
that no merely natural cause could have so worked upon them their
antipathy to the poor infant was also increased by the ill-success of
divers theological discussions in which it was attempted to convince
him of the errors of his sect ilbrahim it is true was not a skilful
controversialist but the feeling of his religion was strong as
instinct in him and he could neither be enticed nor driven from the
faith which his father had died for

the odium of this stubbornness was shared in a great measure by the
child's protectors insomuch that tobias and dorothy very shortly
began to experience a most bitter species of persecution in the cold
regards of many a friend whom they had valued the common people
manifested their opinions more openly pearson was a man of some
consideration being a representative to the general court and an
approved lieutenant in the train-bands yet within a week after his
adoption of ilbrahim he had been both hissed and hooted once also
when walking through a solitary piece of woods he heard a loud voice
from some invisible speaker and it cried what shall be done to the
backslider lo the scourge is knotted for him even the whip of nine
cords and every cord three knots these insults irritated pearson's
temper for the moment they entered also into his heart and became
imperceptible but powerful workers toward an end which his most secret
thought had not yet whispered

 

on the second sabbath after ilbrahim became a member of their family
pearson and his wife deemed it proper that he should appear with them
at public worship they had anticipated some opposition to this
measure from the boy but he prepared himself in silence and at the
appointed hour was clad in the new mourning-suit which dorothy had
wrought for him as the parish was then and during many subsequent
years unprovided with a bell the signal for the commencement of
religious exercises was the beat of a drum at the first sound of that
martial call to the place of holy and quiet thoughts tobias and
dorothy set forth each holding a hand of little ilbrahim like two
parents linked together by the infant of their love on their path
through the leafless woods they were overtaken by many persons of
their acquaintance all of whom avoided them and passed by on the
other side but a severer trial awaited their constancy when they had
descended the hill and drew near the pine-built and undecorated house
of prayer around the door from which the drummer still sent forth
his thundering summons was drawn up a formidable phalanx including
several of the oldest members of the congregation many of the
middle-aged and nearly all the younger males pearson found it
difficult to sustain their united and disapproving gaze but dorothy
whose mind was differently circumstanced merely drew the boy closer
to her and faltered not in her approach as they entered the door they
overheard the muttered sentiments of the assemblage and when the
reviling voices of the little children smote ilbrahim's ear he wept

the interior aspect of the meeting-house was rude the low ceiling
the unplastered walls the naked woodwork and the undraperied pulpit
offered nothing to excite the devotion which without such external
aids often remains latent in the heart the floor of the building was
occupied by rows of long cushionless benches supplying the place of
pews and the broad aisle formed a sexual division impassable except
by children beneath a certain age

pearson and dorothy separated at the door of the meeting-house and
ilbrahim being within the years of infancy was retained under the
care of the latter the wrinkled beldams involved themselves in their
rusty cloaks as he passed by even the mild-featured maidens seemed to
dread contamination and many a stern old man arose and turned his
repulsive and unheavenly countenance upon the gentle boy as if the
sanctuary were polluted by his presence he was a sweet infant of the
skies that had strayed away from his home and all the inhabitants of
this miserable world closed up their impure hearts against him drew
back their earth-soiled garments from his touch and said we are
holier than thou

ilbrahim seated by the side of his adopted mother and retaining fast
hold of her hand assumed a grave and decorous demeanor such as might
befit a person of matured taste and understanding who should find
himself in a temple dedicated to some worship which he did not
recognize but felt himself bound to respect the exercises had not
yet commenced however when the boy's attention was arrested by an
event apparently of trifling interest a woman having her face muffled
in a hood and a cloak drawn completely about her form advanced slowly
up the broad aisle and took place upon the foremost bench ilbrahim's
faint color varied his nerves fluttered he was unable to turn his
eyes from the muffled female

when the preliminary prayer and hymn were over the minister arose
and having turned the hour-glass which stood by the great bible
commenced his discourse he was now well stricken in years a man of
pale thin countenance and his gray hairs were closely covered by a
black velvet skull-cap in his younger days he had practically learned
the meaning of persecution from archbishop laud and he was not now
disposed to forget the lesson against which he had murmured then
introducing the often-discussed subject of the quakers he gave a
history of that sect and a description of their tenets in which error
predominated and prejudice distorted the aspect of what was true he
adverted to the recent measures in the province and cautioned his
hearers of weaker parts against calling in question the just severity
which god-fearing magistrates had at length been compelled to
exercise he spoke of the danger of pity in some cases a commendable
and christian virtue but inapplicable to this pernicious sect he
observed that such was their devilish obstinacy in error that even the
little children the sucking babes were hardened and desperate
heretics he affirmed that no man without heaven's especial warrant
should attempt their conversion lest while he lent his hand to draw
them from the slough he should himself be precipitated into its lowest
depths

the sands of the second hour were principally in the lower half of the
glass when the sermon concluded an approving murmur followed and the
clergyman having given out a hymn took his seat with much
self-congratulation and endeavored to read the effect of his
eloquence in the visages of the people but while voices from all
parts of the house were tuning themselves to sing a scene occurred
which though not very unusual at that period in the province
happened to be without precedent in this parish

the muffled female who had hitherto sat motionless in the front rank
of the audience now arose and with slow stately and unwavering step
ascended the pulpit stairs the quaverings of incipient harmony were
hushed and the divine sat in speechless and almost terrified
astonishment while she undid the door and stood up in the sacred desk
from which his maledictions had just been thundered she then divested
herself of the cloak and hood and appeared in a most singular array
a shapeless robe of sackcloth was girded about her waist with a
knotted cord her raven hair fell down upon her shoulders and its
blackness was defiled by pale streaks of ashes which she had strewn
upon her head her eyebrows dark and strongly defined added to the
deathly whiteness of a countenance which emaciated with want and wild
with enthusiasm and strange sorrows retained no trace of earlier
beauty this figure stood gazing earnestly on the audience and there
was no sound nor any movement except a faint shuddering which every
man observed in his neighbor but was scarcely conscious of in
himself at length when her fit of inspiration came she spoke for
the first few moments in a low voice and not invariably distinct
utterance her discourse gave evidence of an imagination hopelessly
entangled with her reason it was a vague and incomprehensible
rhapsody which however seemed to spread its own atmosphere round
the hearer's soul and to move his feelings by some influence
unconnected with the words as she proceeded beautiful but shadowy
images would sometimes be seen like bright things moving in a turbid
river or a strong and singularly shaped idea leapt forth and seized
at once on the understanding or the heart but the course of her
unearthly eloquence soon led her to the persecutions of her sect and
from thence the step was short to her own peculiar sorrows she was
naturally a woman of mighty passions and hatred and revenge now
wrapped themselves in the garb of piety the character of her speech
was changed her images became distinct though wild and her
denunciations had an almost hellish bitterness

the governor and his mighty men she said have gathered together
taking counsel among themselves and saying what shall we do unto
this people even unto the people that have come into this land to put
our iniquity to the blush and lo the devil entereth into the
council-chamber like a lame man of low stature and gravely apparelled
with a dark and twisted countenance and a bright downcast eye and he
standeth up among the rulers yea he goeth to and fro whispering to
each and every man lends his ear for his word is slay slay but i
say unto ye woe to them that slay woe to them that shed the blood of
saints woe to them that have slain the husband and cast forth the
child the tender infant to wander homeless and hungry and cold till
he die and have saved the mother alive in the cruelty of their tender
mercies woe to them in their lifetime cursed are they in the delight
and pleasure of their hearts woe to them in their death-hour whether
it come swiftly with blood and violence or after long and lingering
pain woe in the dark house in the rottenness of the grave when the
children's children shall revile the ashes of the fathers woe woe
woe at the judgment when all the persecuted and all the slain in
this bloody land and the father the mother and the child shall
await them in a day that they cannot escape seed of the faith seed
of the faith ye whose hearts are moving with a power that ye know
not arise wash your hands of this innocent blood lift your voices
chosen ones cry aloud and call down a woe and a judgment with me

having thus given vent to the flood of malignity which she mistook for
inspiration the speaker was silent her voice was succeeded by the
hysteric shrieks of several women but the feelings of the audience
generally had not been drawn onward in the current with her own they
remained stupefied stranded as it were in the midst of a torrent
which deafened them by its roaring but might not move them by its
violence the clergyman who could not hitherto have ejected the
usurper of his pulpit otherwise than by bodily force now addressed
her in the tone of just indignation and legitimate authority

get you down woman from the holy place which you profane he said
is it to the lord's house that you come to pour forth the foulness of
your heart and the inspiration of the devil get you down and
remember that the sentence of death is on you yea and shall be
executed were it but for this day's work

i go friend i go for the voice hath had its utterance replied
she in a depressed and even mild tone i have done my mission unto
thee and to thy people reward me with stripes imprisonment or death
as ye shall be permitted the weakness of exhausted passion caused
her steps to totter as she descended the pulpit stairs

the people in the mean while were stirring to and fro on the floor
of the house whispering among themselves and glancing toward the
intruder many of them now recognized her as the woman who had
assaulted the governor with frightful language as he passed by the
window of her prison they knew also that she was adjudged to suffer
death and had been preserved only by an involuntary banishment into
the wilderness the new outrage by which she had provoked her fate
seemed to render further lenity impossible and a gentleman in
military dress with a stout man of inferior rank drew toward the
door of the meetinghouse and awaited her approach scarcely did her
feet press the floor however when an unexpected scene occurred in
that moment of her peril when every eye frowned with death a little
timid boy threw his arms round his mother

i am here mother it is i and i will go with thee to prison he
exclaimed

she gazed at him with a doubtful and almost frightened expression for
she knew that the boy had been cast out to perish and she had not
hoped to see his face again she feared perhaps that it was but one
of the happy visions with which her excited fancy had often deceived
her in the solitude of the desert or in prison but when she felt his
hand warm within her own and heard his little eloquence of childish
love she began to know that she was yet a mother

blessed art thou my son she sobbed my heart was withered yea
dead with thee and with thy father and now it leaps as in the first
moment when i pressed thee to my bosom

she knelt down and embraced him again and again while the joy that
could find no words expressed itself in broken accents like the
bubbles gushing up to vanish at the surface of a deep fountain the
sorrows of past years and the darker peril that was nigh cast not a
shadow on the brightness of that fleeting moment soon however the
spectators saw a change upon her face as the consciousness of her sad
estate returned and grief supplied the fount of tears which joy had
opened by the words she uttered it would seem that the indulgence of
natural love had given her mind a momentary sense of its errors and
made her know how far she had strayed from duty in following the
dictates of a wild fanaticism

in a doleful hour art thou returned to me poor boy she said for
thy mother's path has gone darkening onward till now the end is
death son son i have borne thee in my arms when my limbs were
tottering and i have fed thee with the food that i was fainting for
yet i have ill-performed a mother's part by thee in life and now i
leave thee no inheritance but woe and shame thou wilt go seeking
through the world and find all hearts closed against thee and their
sweet affections turned to bitterness for my sake my child my child
how many a pang awaits thy gentle spirit and i the cause of all

she hid her face on ilbrahim's head and her long raven hair
discolored with the ashes of her mourning fell down about him like a
veil a low and interrupted moan was the voice of her heart's anguish
and it did not fail to move the sympathies of many who mistook their
involuntary virtue for a sin sobs were audible in the female section
of the house and every man who was a father drew his hand across his
eyes

tobias pearson was agitated and uneasy but a certain feeling like the
consciousness of guilt oppressed him so that he could not go forth
and offer himself as the protector of the child dorothy however had
watched her husband's eye her mind was free from the influence that
had begun to work on his and she drew near the quaker woman and
addressed her in the hearing of all the congregation

stranger trust this boy to me and i will be his mother she said
taking ilbrahim's hand providence has signally marked out my husband
to protect him and he has fed at our table and lodged under our roof
now many days till our hearts have grown very strongly unto him
leave the tender child with us and be at ease concerning his
welfare

the quaker rose from the ground but drew the boy closer to her while
she gazed earnestly in dorothy's face her mild but saddened features
and neat matronly attire harmonized together and were like a verse of
fireside poetry her very aspect proved that she was blameless so far
as mortal could be so in respect to god and man while the
enthusiast in her robe of sackcloth and girdle of knotted cord had
as evidently violated the duties of the present life and the future by
fixing her attention wholly on the latter the two females as they
held each a hand of ilbrahim formed a practical allegory it was
rational piety and unbridled fanaticism contending for the empire of a
young heart

thou art not of our people said the quaker mournfully

no we are not of your people replied dorothy with mildness but
we are christians looking upward to the same heaven with you doubt
not that your boy shall meet you there if there be a blessing on our
tender and prayerful guidance of him thither i trust my own
children have gone before me for i also have been a mother i am no
longer so she added in a faltering tone and your son will have
all my care

but will ye lead him in the path which his parents have trodden
demanded the quaker can ye teach him the enlightened faith which his
father has died for and for which i even i am soon to become an
unworthy martyr the boy has been baptized in blood will ye keep the
mark fresh and ruddy upon his forehead

i will not deceive you answered dorothy if your child become our
child we must breed him up in the instruction which heaven has
imparted to us we must pray for him the prayers of our own faith we
must do toward him according to the dictates of our own consciences
and not of yours were we to act otherwise we should abuse your
trust even in complying with your wishes

the mother looked down upon her boy with a troubled countenance and
then turned her eyes upward to heaven she seemed to pray internally
and the contention of her soul was evident

friend she said at length to dorothy i doubt not that my son
shall receive all earthly tenderness at thy hands nay i will believe
that even thy imperfect lights may guide him to a better world for
surely thou art on the path thither but thou hast spoken of a
husband doth he stand here among this multitude of people let him
come forth for i must know to whom i commit this most precious
trust

she turned her face upon the male auditors and after a momentary
delay tobias pearson came forth from among them the quaker saw the
dress which marked his military rank and shook her head but then she
noted the hesitating air the eyes that struggled with her own and
were vanquished the color that went and came and could find no
resting-place as she gazed an unmirthful smile spread over her
features like sunshine that grows melancholy in some desolate spot
her lips moved inaudibly but at length she spake

i hear it i hear it the voice speaketh within me and saith leave
thy child catharine for his place is here and go hence for i have
other work for thee break the bonds of natural affection martyr thy
love and know that in all these things eternal wisdom hath its ends
i go friends i go take ye my boy my precious jewel i go hence
trusting that all shall be well and that even for his infant hands
there is a labor in the vineyard

she knelt down and whispered to ilbrahim who at first struggled and
clung to his mother with sobs and tears but remained passive when she
had kissed his cheek and arisen from the ground having held her hands
over his head in mental prayer she was ready to depart

farewell friends in mine extremity she said to pearson and his
wife the good deed ye have done me is a treasure laid up in heaven
to be returned a thousandfold hereafter and farewell ye mine
enemies to whom it is not permitted to harm so much as a hair of my
head nor to stay my footsteps even for a moment the day is coming
when ye shall call upon me to witness for ye to this one sin
uncommitted and i will rise up and answer

she turned her steps toward the door and the men who had stationed
themselves to guard it withdrew and suffered her to pass a general
sentiment of pity overcame the virulence of religious hatred
sanctified by her love and her affliction she went forth and all the
people gazed after her till she had journeyed up the hill and was lost
behind its brow she went the apostle of her own unquiet heart to
renew the wanderings of past years for her voice had been already
heard in many lands of christendom and she had pined in the cells of
a catholic inquisition before she felt the lash and lay in the
dungeons of the puritans her mission had extended also to the
followers of the prophet and from them she had received the courtesy
and kindness which all the contending sects of our purer religion
united to deny her her husband and herself had resided many months in
turkey where even the sultan's countenance was gracious to them in
that pagan land too was ilbrahim's birthplace and his oriental name
was a mark of gratitude for the good deeds of an unbeliever

 

when pearson and his wife had thus acquired all the rights over
ilbrahim that could be delegated their affection for him became like
the memory of their native land or their mild sorrow for the dead a
piece of the immovable furniture of their hearts the boy also after
a week or two of mental disquiet began to gratify his protectors by
many inadvertent proofs that he considered them as parents and their
house as home before the winter snows were melted the persecuted
infant the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country seemed
native in the new england cottage and inseparable from the warmth and
security of its hearth under the influence of kind treatment and in
the consciousness that he was loved ilbrahim's demeanor lost a
premature manliness which had resulted from his earlier situation he
became more childlike and his natural character displayed itself with
freedom it was in many respects a beautiful one yet the disordered
imaginations of both his father and mother had perhaps propagated a
certain unhealthiness in the mind of the boy in his general state
ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling events and from
every object about him he seemed to discover rich treasures of
happiness by a faculty analogous to that of the witch-hazel which
points to hidden gold where all is barren to the eye his airy gayety
coming to him from a thousand sources communicated itself to the
family and ilbrahim was like a domesticated sunbeam brightening
moody countenances and chasing away the gloom from the dark corners of
the cottage

on the other hand as the susceptibility of pleasure is also that of
pain the exuberant cheerfulness of the boy's prevailing temper
sometimes yielded to moments of deep depression his sorrows could not
always be followed up to their original source but most frequently
they appeared to flow though ilbrahim was young to be sad for such a
cause from wounded love the flightiness of his mirth rendered him
often guilty of offences against the decorum of a puritan household
and on these occasions he did not invariably escape rebuke but the
slightest word of real bitterness which he was infallible in
distinguishing from pretended anger seemed to sink into his heart and
poison all his enjoyments till he became sensible that he was entirely
forgiven of the malice which generally accompanies a superfluity of
sensitiveness ilbrahim was altogether destitute when trodden upon he
would not turn when wounded he could but die his mind was wanting
in the stamina of self-support it was a plant that would twine
beautifully round something stronger than itself but if repulsed or
torn away it had no choice but to wither on the ground dorothy's
acuteness taught her that severity would crush the spirit of the
child and she nurtured him with the gentle care of one who handles a
butterfly her husband manifested an equal affection although it grew
daily less productive of familiar caresses

the feelings of the neighboring people in regard to the quaker infant
and his protectors had not undergone a favorable change in spite of
the momentary triumph which the desolate mother had obtained over
their sympathies the scorn and bitterness of which he was the object
were very grievous to ilbrahim especially when any circumstance made
him sensible that the children his equals in age partook of the enmity
of their parents his tender and social nature had already overflowed
in attachments to everything about him and still there was a residue
of unappropriated love which he yearned to bestow upon the little ones
who were taught to hate him as the warm days of spring came on
ilbrahim was accustomed to remain for hours silent and inactive within
hearing of the children's voices at their play yet with his usual
delicacy of feeling he avoided their notice and would flee and hide
himself from the smallest individual among them chance however at
length seemed to open a medium of communication between his heart and
theirs it was by means of a boy about two years older than ilbrahim
who was injured by a fall from a tree in the vicinity of pearson's
habitation as the sufferer's own home was at some distance dorothy
willingly received him under her roof and became his tender and
careful nurse

ilbrahim was the unconscious possessor of much skill in physiognomy
and it would have deterred him in other circumstances from attempting
to make a friend of this boy the countenance of the latter
immediately impressed a beholder disagreeably but it required some
examination to discover that the cause was a very slight distortion of
the mouth and the irregular broken line and near approach of the
eyebrows analogous perhaps to these trifling deformities was an
almost imperceptible twist of every joint and the uneven prominence of
the breast forming a body regular in its general outline but faulty
in almost all its details the disposition of the boy was sullen and
reserved and the village schoolmaster stigmatized him as obtuse in
intellect although at a later period of life he evinced ambition and
very peculiar talents but whatever might be his personal or moral
irregularities ilbrahim's heart seized upon and clung to him from the
moment that he was brought wounded into the cottage the child of
persecution seemed to compare his own fate with that of the sufferer
and to feel that even different modes of misfortune had created a sort
of relationship between them food rest and the fresh air for which
he languished were neglected he nestled continually by the bedside of
the little stranger and with a fond jealousy endeavored to be the
medium of all the cares that were bestowed upon him as the boy became
convalescent ilbrahim contrived games suitable to his situation or
amused him by a faculty which he had perhaps breathed in with the air
of his barbaric birthplace it was that of reciting imaginary
adventures on the spur of the moment and apparently in inexhaustible
succession his tales were of course monstrous disjointed and
without aim but they were curious on account of a vein of human
tenderness which ran through them all and was like a sweet familiar
face encountered in the midst of wild and unearthly scenery the
auditor paid much attention to these romances and sometimes
interrupted them by brief remarks upon the incidents displaying
shrewdness above his years mingled with a moral obliquity which
grated very harshly against ilbrahim's instinctive rectitude nothing
however could arrest the progress of the latter's affection and
there were many proofs that it met with a response from the dark and
stubborn nature on which it was lavished the boy's parents at length
removed him to complete his cure under their own roof

ilbrahim did not visit his new friend after his departure but he made
anxious and continual inquiries respecting him and informed himself of
the day when he was to reappear among his playmates on a pleasant
summer afternoon the children of the neighborhood had assembled in the
little forest-crowned amphitheatre behind the meeting-house and the
recovering invalid was there leaning on a staff the glee of a score
of untainted bosoms was heard in light and airy voices which danced
among the trees like sunshine become audible the grown men of this
weary world as they journeyed by the spot marvelled why life
beginning in such brightness should proceed in gloom and their
hearts or their imaginations answered them and said that the bliss of
childhood gushes from its innocence but it happened that an
unexpected addition was made to the heavenly little band it was
ilbrahim who came toward the children with a look of sweet confidence
on his fair and spiritual face as if having manifested his love to
one of them he had no longer to fear a repulse from their society a
hush came over their mirth the moment they beheld him and they stood
whispering to each other while he drew nigh but all at once the devil
of their fathers entered into the unbreeched fanatics and sending up
a fierce shrill cry they rushed upon the poor quaker child in an
instant he was the centre of a brood of baby-fiends who lifted sticks
against him pelted him with stones and displayed an instinct of
destruction far more loathsome than the bloodthirstiness of manhood

the invalid in the mean while stood apart from the tumult crying
out with a loud voice fear not ilbrahim come hither and take my
hand and his unhappy friend endeavored to obey him after watching
the victim's struggling approach with a calm smile and unabashed eye
the foul-hearted little villain lifted his staff and struck ilbrahim
on the mouth so forcibly that the blood issued in a stream the poor
child's arms had been raised to guard his head from the storm of
blows but now he dropped them at once his persecutors beat him down
trampled upon him dragged him by his long fair locks and ilbrahim
was on the point of becoming as veritable a martyr as ever entered
bleeding into heaven the uproar however attracted the notice of a
few neighbors who put themselves to the trouble of rescuing the
little heretic and of conveying him to pearson's door

ilbrahim's bodily harm was severe but long and careful nursing
accomplished his recovery the injury done to his sensitive spirit was
more serious though not so visible its signs were principally of a
negative character and to be discovered only by those who had
previously known him his gait was thenceforth slow even and unvaried
by the sudden bursts of sprightlier motion which had once corresponded
to his overflowing gladness his countenance was heavier and its
former play of expression the dance of sunshine reflected from moving
water was destroyed by the cloud over his existence his notice was
attracted in a far less degree by passing events and he appeared to
find greater difficulty in comprehending what was new to him than at a
happier period a stranger founding his judgment upon these
circumstances would have said that the dulness of the child's
intellect widely contradicted the promise of his features but the
secret was in the direction of ilbrahim's thoughts which were
brooding within him when they should naturally have been wandering
abroad an attempt of dorothy to revive his former sportiveness was
the single occasion on which his quiet demeanor yielded to a violent
display of grief he burst into passionate weeping and ran and hid
himself for his heart had become so miserably sore that even the hand
of kindness tortured it like fire sometimes at night and probably in
his dreams he was heard to cry mother mother as if her place
which a stranger had supplied while ilbrahim was happy admitted of no
substitute in his extreme affliction perhaps among the many
life-weary wretches then upon the earth there was not one who combined
innocence and misery like this poor broken-hearted infant so soon the
victim of his own heavenly nature

while this melancholy change had taken place in ilbrahim one of an
earlier origin and of different character had come to its perfection
in his adopted father the incident with which this tale commences
found pearson in a state of religious dulness yet mentally disquieted
and longing for a more fervid faith than he possessed the first
effect of his kindness to ilbrahim was to produce a softened feeling
an incipient love for the child's whole sect but joined to this and
resulting perhaps from self-suspicion was a proud and ostentatious
contempt of their tenets and practical extravagances in the course of
much thought however for the subject struggled irresistibly into his
mind the foolishness of the doctrine began to be less evident and
the points which had particularly offended his reason assumed another
aspect or vanished entirely away the work within him appeared to go
on even while he slept and that which had been a doubt when he laid
down to rest would often hold the place of a truth confirmed by some
forgotten demonstration when he recalled his thoughts in the morning
but while he was thus becoming assimilated to the enthusiasts his
contempt in nowise decreasing toward them grew very fierce against
himself he imagined also that every face of his acquaintance wore a
sneer and that every word addressed to him was a gibe such was his
state of mind at the period of ilbrahim's misfortune and the emotions
consequent upon that event completed the change of which the child had
been the original instrument

in the mean time neither the fierceness of the persecutors nor the
infatuation of their victims had decreased the dungeons were never
empty the streets of almost every village echoed daily with the lash
the life of a woman whose mild and christian spirit no cruelty could
embitter had been sacrificed and more innocent blood was yet to
pollute the hands that were so often raised in prayer early after the
restoration the english quakers represented to charles ii that a
vein of blood was open in his dominions but though the displeasure
of the voluptuous king was roused his interference was not prompt
and now the tale must stride forward over many months leaving pearson
to encounter ignominy and misfortune his wife to a firm endurance of
a thousand sorrows poor ilbrahim to pine and droop like a cankered
rose-bud his mother to wander on a mistaken errand neglectful of
the holiest trust which can be committed to a woman

 

a winter evening a night of storm had darkened over pearson's
habitation and there were no cheerful faces to drive the gloom from
his broad hearth the fire it is true sent forth a glowing heat and
a ruddy light and large logs dripping with half-melted snow lay ready
to cast upon the embers but the apartment was saddened in its aspect
by the absence of much of the homely wealth which had once adorned it
for the exaction of repeated fines and his own neglect of temporal
affairs had greatly impoverished the owner and with the furniture of
peace the implements of war had likewise disappeared the sword was
broken the helm and cuirass were cast away for ever the soldier had
done with battles and might not lift so much as his naked hand to
guard his head but the holy book remained and the table on which it
rested was drawn before the fire while two of the persecuted sect
sought comfort from its pages

he who listened while the other read was the master of the house now
emaciated in form and altered as to the expression and healthiness of
his countenance for his mind had dwelt too long among visionary
thoughts and his body had been worn by imprisonment and stripes the
hale and weatherbeaten old man who sat beside him had sustained less
injury from a far longer course of the same mode of life in person he
was tall and dignified and which alone would have made him hateful
to the puritans his gray locks fell from beneath the broad-brimmed
hat and rested on his shoulders as the old man read the sacred page
the snow drifted against the windows or eddied in at the crevices of
the door while a blast kept laughing in the chimney and the blaze
leaped fiercely up to seek it and sometimes when the wind struck the
hill at a certain angle and swept down by the cottage across the
wintry plain its voice was the most doleful that can be conceived it
came as if the past were speaking as if the dead had contributed each
a whisper as if the desolation of ages were breathed in that one
lamenting sound

the quaker at length closed the book retaining however his hand
between the pages which he had been reading while he looked
steadfastly at pearson the attitude and features of the latter might
have indicated the endurance of bodily pain he leaned his forehead on
his hands his teeth were firmly closed and his frame was tremulous at
intervals with a nervous agitation

friend tobias inquired the old man compassionately hast thou
found no comfort in these many blessed passages of scripture

thy voice has fallen on my ear like a sound afar off and indistinct
replied pearson without lifting his eyes yea and when i have
hearkened carefully the words seemed cold and lifeless and intended
for another and a lesser grief than mine remove the book he added
in a tone of sullen bitterness i have no part in its consolations
and they do but fret my sorrow the more

nay feeble brother be not as one who hath never known the light
said the elder quaker earnestly but with mildness art thou he that
wouldst be content to give all and endure all for conscience sake
desiring even peculiar trials that thy faith might be purified and thy
heart weaned from worldly desires and wilt thou sink beneath an
affliction which happens alike to them that have their portion here
below and to them that lay up treasure in heaven faint not for thy
burden is yet light

it is heavy it is heavier than i can bear exclaimed pearson with
the impatience of a variable spirit from my youth upward i have been
a man marked out for wrath and year by year yea day after day i
have endured sorrows such as others know not in their lifetime and
now i speak not of the love that has been turned to hatred the honor
to ignominy the ease and plentifulness of all things to danger want
and nakedness all this i could have borne and counted myself blessed
but when my heart was desolate with many losses i fixed it upon the
child of a stranger and he became dearer to me than all my buried
ones and now he too must die as if my love were poison verily i am
an accursed man and i will lay me down in the dust and lift up my
head no more

thou sinnest brother but it is not for me to rebuke thee for i
also have had my hours of darkness wherein i have murmured against the
cross said the old quaker he continued perhaps in the hope of
distracting his companion's thoughts from his own sorrows even of
late was the light obscured within me when the men of blood had
banished me on pain of death and the constables led me onward from
village to village toward the wilderness a strong and cruel hand was
wielding the knotted cords they sunk deep into the flesh and thou
mightst have tracked every reel and totter of my footsteps by the
blood that followed as we went on 

have i not borne all this and have i murmured interrupted pearson
impatiently

nay friend but hear me continued the other as we journeyed on
night darkened on our path so that no man could see the rage of the
persecutors or the constancy of my endurance though heaven forbid
that i should glory therein the lights began to glimmer in the
cottage windows and i could discern the inmates as they gathered in
comfort and security every man with his wife and children by their
own evening hearth at length we came to a tract of fertile land in
the dim light the forest was not visible around it and behold there
was a straw-thatched dwelling which bore the very aspect of my home
far over the wild ocean far in our own england then came bitter
thoughts upon me yea remembrances that were like death to my soul
the happiness of my early days was painted to me the disquiet of my
manhood the altered faith of my declining years i remembered how i
had been moved to go forth a wanderer when my daughter the youngest
the dearest of my flock lay on her dying-bed and 

couldst thou obey the command at such a moment exclaimed pearson
shuddering

yea yea replied the old man hurriedly i was kneeling by her
bedside when the voice spoke loud within me but immediately i rose
and took my staff and gat me gone oh that it were permitted me to
forget her woeful look when i thus withdrew my arm and left her
journeying through the dark valley alone for her soul was faint and
she had leaned upon my prayers now in that night of horror i was
assailed by the thought that i had been an erring christian and a
cruel parent yea even my daughter with her pale dying features
seemed to stand by me and whisper father you are deceived go home
and shelter your gray head o thou to whom i have looked in my
furthest wanderings continued the quaker raising his agitated eyes
to heaven inflict not upon the bloodiest of our persecutors the
unmitigated agony of my soul when i believed that all i had done and
suffered for thee was at the instigation of a mocking fiend but i
yielded not i knelt down and wrestled with the tempter while the
scourge bit more fiercely into the flesh my prayer was heard and i
went on in peace and joy toward the wilderness

the old man though his fanaticism had generally all the calmness of
reason was deeply moved while reciting this tale and his unwonted
emotion seemed to rebuke and keep down that of his companion they sat
in silence with their faces to the fire imagining perhaps in its
red embers new scenes of persecution yet to be encountered the snow
still drifted hard against the windows and sometimes as the blaze of
the logs had gradually sunk came down the spacious chimney and hissed
upon the hearth a cautious footstep might now and then be heard in a
neighboring apartment and the sound invariably drew the eyes of both
quakers to the door which led thither when a fierce and riotous gust
of wind had led his thoughts by a natural association to homeless
travellers on such a night pearson resumed the conversation

i have wellnigh sunk under my own share of this trial observed he
sighing heavily yet i would that it might be doubled to me if so
the child's mother could be spared her wounds have been deep and
many but this will be the sorest of all

fear not for catharine replied the old quaker for i know that
valiant woman and have seen how she can bear the cross a mother's
heart indeed is strong in her and may seem to contend mightily with
her faith but soon she will stand up and give thanks that her son has
been thus early an accepted sacrifice the boy hath done his work and
she will feel that he is taken hence in kindness both to him and her
blessed blessed are they that with so little suffering can enter into
peace

the fitful rush of the wind was now disturbed by a portentous sound
it was a quick and heavy knocking at the outer door pearson's wan
countenance grew paler for many a visit of persecution had taught him
what to dread the old man on the other hand stood up erect and his
glance was firm as that of the tried soldier who awaits his enemy

the men of blood have come to seek me he observed with calmness
they have heard how i was moved to return from banishment and now am
i to be led to prison and thence to death it is an end i have long
looked for i will open unto them lest they say lo he feareth

nay i will present myself before them said pearson with recovered
fortitude it may be that they seek me alone and know not that thou
abidest with me

let us go boldly both one and the other rejoined his companion
it is not fitting that thou or i should shrink

they therefore proceeded through the entry to the door which they
opened bidding the applicant come in in god's name a furious
blast of wind drove the storm into their faces and extinguished the
lamp they had barely time to discern a figure so white from head to
foot with the drifted snow that it seemed like winter's self come in
human shape to seek refuge from its own desolation

enter friend and do thy errand be it what it may said pearson
it must needs be pressing since thou comest on such a bitter night

peace be with this household said the stranger when they stood on
the floor of the inner apartment

pearson started the elder quaker stirred the slumbering embers of the
fire till they sent up a clear and lofty blaze it was a female voice
that had spoken it was a female form that shone out cold and wintry
in that comfortable light

catharine blessed woman exclaimed the old man art thou come to
this darkened land again art thou come to bear a valiant testimony as
in former years the scourge hath not prevailed against thee and
from the dungeon hast thou come forth triumphant but strengthen
strengthen now thy heart catharine for heaven will prove thee yet
this once ere thou go to thy reward

rejoice friends she replied thou who hast long been of our
people and thou whom a little child hath led to us rejoice lo i
come the messenger of glad tidings for the day of persecution is
over-past the heart of the king even charles hath been moved in
gentleness toward us and he hath sent forth his letters to stay the
hands of the men of blood a ship's company of our friends hath
arrived at yonder town and i also sailed joyfully among them

as catharine spoke her eyes were roaming about the room in search of
him for whose sake security was dear to her pearson made a silent
appeal to the old man nor did the latter shrink from the painful task
assigned him

sister he began in a softened yet perfectly calm tone thou
tellest us of his love manifested in temporal good and now must we
speak to thee of that selfsame love displayed in chastenings
hitherto catharine thou hast been as one journeying in a darksome
and difficult path and leading an infant by the hand fain wouldst
thou have looked heavenward continually but still the cares of that
little child have drawn thine eyes and thy affections to the earth
sister go on rejoicing for his tottering footsteps shall impede
thine own no more

but the unhappy mother was not thus to be consoled she shook like a
leaf she turned white as the very snow that hung drifted into her
hair the firm old man extended his hand and held her up keeping his
eye upon hers as if to repress any outbreak of passion

i am a woman i am but a woman will he try me above my strength
said catharine very quickly and almost in a whisper i have been
wounded sore i have suffered much many things in the body many in
the mind crucified in myself and in them that were dearest to me
surely added she with a long shudder he hath spared me in this
one thing she broke forth with sudden and irrepressible violence
tell me man of cold heart what has god done to me hath he cast
me down never to rise again hath he crushed my very heart in his
hand and thou to whom i committed my child how hast thou fulfilled
thy trust give me back the boy well sound alive alive or earth
and heaven shall avenge me

the agonized shriek of catharine was answered by the faint the very
faint voice of a child

on this day it had become evident to pearson to his aged guest and to
dorothy that ilbrahim's brief and troubled pilgrimage drew near its
close the two former would willingly have remained by him to make use
of the prayers and pious discourses which they deemed appropriate to
the time and which if they be impotent as to the departing
traveller's reception in the world whither he goes may at least
sustain him in bidding adieu to earth but though ilbrahim uttered no
complaint he was disturbed by the faces that looked upon him so that
dorothy's entreaties and their own conviction that the child's feet
might tread heaven's pavement and not soil it had induced the two
quakers to remove ilbrahim then closed his eyes and grew calm and
except for now and then a kind and low word to his nurse might have
been thought to slumber as nightfall came on however and the storm
began to rise something seemed to trouble the repose of the boy's
mind and to render his sense of hearing active and acute if a passing
wind lingered to shake the casement he strove to turn his head toward
it if the door jarred to and fro upon its hinges he looked long and
anxiously thitherward if the heavy voice of the old man as he read
the scriptures rose but a little higher the child almost held his
dying-breath to listen if a snowdrift swept by the cottage with a
sound like the trailing of a garment ilbrahim seemed to watch that
some visitant should enter but after a little time he relinquished
whatever secret hope had agitated him and with one low complaining
whisper turned his cheek upon the pillow he then addressed dorothy
with his usual sweetness and besought her to draw near him she did
so and ilbrahim took her hand in both of his grasping it with a
gentle pressure as if to assure himself that he retained it at
intervals and without disturbing the repose of his countenance a
very faint trembling passed over him from head to foot as if a mild
but somewhat cool wind had breathed upon him and made him shiver

as the boy thus led her by the hand in his quiet progress over the
borders of eternity dorothy almost imagined that she could discern
the near though dim delightfulness of the home he was about to reach
she would not have enticed the little wanderer back though she
bemoaned herself that she must leave him and return but just when
ilbrahim's feet were pressing on the soil of paradise he heard a voice
behind him and it recalled him a few few paces of the weary path
which he had travelled as dorothy looked upon his features she
perceived that their placid expression was again disturbed her own
thoughts had been so wrapped in him that all sounds of the storm and
of human speech were lost to her but when catharine's shriek pierced
through the room the boy strove to raise himself

friend she is come open unto her cried he

in a moment his mother was kneeling by the bedside she drew ilbrahim
to her bosom and he nestled there with no violence of joy but
contentedly as if he were hushing himself to sleep he looked into her
face and reading its agony said with feeble earnestness

mourn not dearest mother i am happy now and with these words the
gentle boy was dead

 

the king's mandate to stay the new england persecutors was effectual
in preventing further martyrdoms but the colonial authorities
trusting in the remoteness of their situation and perhaps in the
supposed instability of the royal government shortly renewed their
severities in all other respects catharine's fanaticism had become
wilder by the sundering of all human ties and wherever a scourge was
lifted there was she to receive the blow and whenever a dungeon was
unbarred thither she came to cast herself upon the floor but in
process of time a more christian spirit a spirit of forbearance
though not of cordiality or approbation began to pervade the land in
regard to the persecuted sect and then when the rigid old pilgrims
eyed her rather in pity than in wrath when the matrons fed her with
the fragments of their children's food and offered her a lodging on a
hard and lowly bed when no little crowd of schoolboys left their
sports to cast stones after the roving enthusiast then did catharine
return to pearson's dwelling and made that her home

as if ilbrahim's sweetness yet lingered round his ashes as if his
gentle spirit came down from heaven to teach his parent a true
religion her fierce and vindictive nature was softened by the same
griefs which had once irritated it when the course of years had made
the features of the unobtrusive mourner familiar in the settlement
she became a subject of not deep but general interest a being on whom
the otherwise superfluous sympathies of all might be bestowed every
one spoke of her with that degree of pity which it is pleasant to
experience every one was ready to do her the little kindnesses which
are not costly yet manifest good-will and when at last she died a
long train of her once bitter persecutors followed her with decent
sadness and tears that were not painful to her place by ilbrahim's
green and sunken grave




mr higginbotham's catastrophe


a young fellow a tobacco-pedler by trade was on his way from
morristown where he had dealt largely with the deacon of the shaker
settlement to the village of parker's falls on salmon river he had
a neat little cart painted green with a box of cigars depicted on
each side-panel and an indian chief holding a pipe and a golden
tobacco-stalk on the rear the pedler drove a smart little mare and
was a young man of excellent character keen at a bargain but none
the worse liked by the yankees who as i have heard them say would
rather be shaved with a sharp razor than a dull one especially was he
beloved by the pretty girls along the connecticut whose favor he used
to court by presents of the best smoking-tobacco in his stock knowing
well that the country-lasses of new england are generally great
performers on pipes moreover as will be seen in the course of my
story the pedler was inquisitive and something of a tattler always
itching to hear the news and anxious to tell it again

after an early breakfast at morristown the tobacco-pedler whose name
was dominicus pike had travelled seven miles through a solitary piece
of woods without speaking a word to anybody but himself and his little
gray mare it being nearly seven o'clock he was as eager to hold a
morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper an
opportunity seemed at hand when after lighting a cigar with a
sun-glass he looked up and perceived a man coming over the brow of
the hill at the foot of which the pedler had stopped his green cart
dominicus watched him as he descended and noticed that he carried a
bundle over his shoulder on the end of a stick and travelled with a
weary yet determined pace he did not look as if he had started in the
freshness of the morning but had footed it all night and meant to do
the same all day

good-morning mister said dominicus when within speaking-distance
you go a pretty good jog what's the latest news at parker's falls

the man pulled the broad brim of a gray hat over his eyes and
answered rather sullenly that he did not come from parker's falls
which as being the limit of his own day's journey the pedler had
naturally mentioned in his inquiry

well then rejoined dominicus pike let's have the latest news
where you did come from i'm not particular about parker's falls any
place will answer

being thus importuned the traveller who was as ill-looking a fellow
as one would desire to meet in a solitary piece of woods appeared to
hesitate a little as if he was either searching his memory for news
or weighing the expediency of telling it at last mounting on the
step of the cart he whispered in the ear of dominicus though he
might have shouted aloud and no other mortal would have heard him

i do remember one little trifle of news said he old mr
higginbotham of kimballton was murdered in his orchard at eight
o'clock last night by an irishman and a nigger they strung him up to
the branch of a st michael's pear tree where nobody would find him
till the morning

as soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated the stranger
betook himself to his journey again with more speed than ever not
even turning his head when dominicus invited him to smoke a spanish
cigar and relate all the particulars the pedler whistled to his mare
and went up the hill pondering on the doleful fate of mr
higginbotham whom he had known in the way of trade having sold him
many a bunch of long nines and a great deal of pig-tail lady's twist
and fig tobacco he was rather astonished at the rapidity with which
the news had spread kimballton was nearly sixty miles distant in a
straight line the murder had been perpetrated only at eight o'clock
the preceding night yet dominicus had heard of it at seven in the
morning when in all probability poor mr higginbotham's own family
had but just discovered his corpse hanging on the st michael's pear
tree the stranger on foot must have worn seven-league boots to
travel at such a rate

ill-news flies fast they say thought dominicus pike but this
beats railroads the fellow ought to be hired to go express with the
president's message

the difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator had made a
mistake of one day in the date of the occurrence so that our friend
did not hesitate to introduce the story at every tavern and
country-store along the road expending a whole bunch of spanish
wrappers among at least twenty horrified audiences he found himself
invariably the first bearer of the intelligence and was so pestered
with questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline till it
became quite a respectable narrative he met with one piece of
corroborative evidence mr higginbotham was a trader and a former
clerk of his to whom dominicus related the facts testified that the
old gentleman was accustomed to return home through the orchard about
nightfall with the money and valuable papers of the store in his
pocket the clerk manifested but little grief at mr higginbotham's
catastrophe hinting what the pedler had discovered in his own
dealings with him that he was a crusty old fellow as close as a vise
his property would descend to a pretty niece who was now keeping
school in kimballton

what with telling the news for the public good and driving bargains
for his own dominicus was so much delayed on the road that he chose
to put up at a tavern about five miles short of parker's falls after
supper lighting one of his prime cigars he seated himself in the
bar-room and went through the story of the murder which had grown so
fast that it took him half an hour to tell there were as many as
twenty people in the room nineteen of whom received it all for
gospel but the twentieth was an elderly farmer who had arrived on
horseback a short time before and was now seated in a corner smoking
his pipe when the story was concluded he rose up very deliberately
brought his chair right in front of dominicus and stared him full in
the face puffing out the vilest tobacco-smoke the pedler had ever
smelt

will you make affidavit demanded he in the tone of a
country-justice taking an examination that old squire higginbotham
of kimballton was murdered in his orchard the night before last and
found hanging on his great pear tree yesterday morning

i tell the story as i heard it mister answered dominicus dropping
his half-burnt cigar i don't say that i saw the thing done so i
can't take my oath that he was murdered exactly in that way

but i can take mine said the farmer that if squire higginbotham
was murdered night before last i drank a glass of bitters with his
ghost this morning being a neighbor of mine he called me into his
store as i was riding by and treated me and then asked me to do a
little business for him on the road he didn't seem to know any more
about his own murder than i did

why then it can't be a fact exclaimed dominicus pike

i guess he'd have mentioned if it was said the old farmer and he
removed his chair back to the corner leaving dominicus quite down in
the mouth

here was a sad resurrection of old mr higginbotham the pedler had no
heart to mingle in the conversation any more but comforted himself
with a glass of gin and water and went to bed where all night long he
dreamed of hanging on the st michael's pear tree

to avoid the old farmer whom he so detested that his suspension would
have pleased him better than mr higginbotham's dominicus rose in
the gray of the morning put the little mare into the green cart and
trotted swiftly away toward parker's falls the fresh breeze the dewy
road and the pleasant summer dawn revived his spirits and might have
encouraged him to repeat the old story had there been anybody awake to
bear it but he met neither ox-team light wagon chaise horseman nor
foot-traveller till just as he crossed salmon river a man came
trudging down to the bridge with a bundle over his shoulder on the
end of a stick

good-morning mister said the pedler reining in his mare if you
come from kimballton or that neighborhood maybe you can tell me the
real fact about this affair of old mr higginbotham was the old
fellow actually murdered two or three nights ago by an irishman and a
nigger

dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe at first that the
stranger himself had a deep tinge of negro blood on hearing this
sudden question the ethiopian appeared to change his skin its yellow
hue becoming a ghastly white while shaking and stammering he thus
replied

no no there was no colored man it was an irishman that hanged him
last night at eight o'clock i came away at seven his folks can't
have looked for him in the orchard yet

scarcely had the yellow man spoken when he interrupted himself and
though he seemed weary enough before continued his journey at a pace
which would have kept the pedler's mare on a smart trot dominicus
stared after him in great perplexity if the murder had not been
committed till tuesday night who was the prophet that had foretold it
in all its circumstances on tuesday morning if mr higginbotham's
corpse were not yet discovered by his own family how came the
mulatto at above thirty miles distance to know that he was hanging
in the orchard especially as he had left kimballton before the
unfortunate man was hanged at all these ambiguous circumstances with
the stranger's surprise and terror made dominicus think of raising a
hue-and-cry after him as an accomplice in the murder since a murder
it seemed had really been perpetrated

but let the poor devil go thought the pedler i don't want his
black blood on my head and hanging the nigger wouldn't unhang mr
higginbotham unhang the old gentleman it's a sin i know but i
should hate to have him come to life a second time and give me the
lie

with these meditations dominicus pike drove into the street of
parker's falls which as everybody knows is as thriving a village as
three cotton-factories and a slitting-mill can make it the machinery
was not in motion and but a few of the shop doors unbarred when he
alighted in the stable-yard of the tavern and made it his first
business to order the mare four quarts of oats his second duty of
course was to impart mr higginbotham's catastrophe to the hostler
he deemed it advisable however not to be too positive as to the date
of the direful fact and also to be uncertain whether it were
perpetrated by an irishman and a mulatto or by the son of erin alone
neither did he profess to relate it on his own authority or that of
any one person but mentioned it as a report generally diffused

the story ran through the town like fire among girdled trees and
became so much the universal talk that nobody could tell whence it had
originated mr higginbotham was as well known at parker's falls as
any citizen of the place being part-owner of the slitting-mill and a
considerable stockholder in the cotton-factories the inhabitants felt
their own prosperity interested in his fate such was the excitement
that the parker's falls gazette anticipated its regular day of
publication and came out with half a form of blank paper and a column
of double pica emphasized with capitals and headed horrid murder of
mr higginbotham among other dreadful details the printed account
described the mark of the cord round the dead man's neck and stated
the number of thousand dollars of which he had been robbed there was
much pathos also about the affliction of his niece who had gone
from one fainting-fit to another ever since her uncle was found
hanging on the st michael's pear tree with his pockets inside out
the village poet likewise commemorated the young lady's grief in
seventeen stanzas of a ballad the selectmen held a meeting and in
consideration of mr higginbotham's claims on the town determined to
issue handbills offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the
apprehension of his murderers and the recovery of the stolen property

meanwhile the whole population of parker's falls consisting of
shopkeepers mistresses of boarding-houses factory-girls mill-men
and schoolboys rushed into the street and kept up such a terrible
loquacity as more than compensated for the silence of the
cotton-machines which refrained from their usual din out of respect
to the deceased had mr higginbotham cared about posthumous renown
his untimely ghost would have exulted in this tumult

our friend dominicus in his vanity of heart forgot his intended
precautions and mounting on the town-pump announced himself as the
bearer of the authentic intelligence which had caused so wonderful a
sensation he immediately became the great man of the moment and had
just begun a new edition of the narrative with a voice like a
field-preacher when the mail-stage drove into the village street it
had travelled all night and must have shifted horses at kimballton at
three in the morning

now we shall hear all the particulars shouted the crowd

the coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern followed by a
thousand people for if any man had been minding his own business till
then he now left it at sixes and sevens to hear the news the pedler
foremost in the race discovered two passengers both of whom had been
startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a
mob every man assailing them with separate questions all propounded
at once the couple were struck speechless though one was a lawyer
and the other a young lady

mr higginbotham mr higginbotham tell us the particulars about old
mr higginbotham bawled the mob what is the coroner's verdict are
the murderers apprehended is mr higginbotham's niece come out of her
fainting-fits mr higginbotham mr higginbotham

the coachman said not a word except to swear awfully at the hostler
for not bringing him a fresh team of horses the lawyer inside had
generally his wits about him even when asleep the first thing he did
after learning the cause of the excitement was to produce a large red
pocketbook meantime dominicus pike being an extremely polite young
man and also suspecting that a female tongue would tell the story as
glibly as a lawyer's had handed the lady out of the coach she was a
fine smart girl now wide awake and bright as a button and had such
a sweet pretty mouth that dominicus would almost as lief have heard a
love-tale from it as a tale of murder

gentlemen and ladies said the lawyer to the shopkeepers the
mill-men and the factory-girls i can assure you that some
unaccountable mistake or more probably a wilful falsehood
maliciously contrived to injure mr higginbotham's credit has excited
this singular uproar we passed through kimballton at three o'clock
this morning and most certainly should have been informed of the
murder had any been perpetrated but i have proof nearly as strong as
mr higginbotham's own oral testimony in the negative here is a note
relating to a suit of his in the connecticut courts which was
delivered me from that gentleman himself i find it dated at ten
o'clock last evening

so saying the lawyer exhibited the date and signature of the note
which irrefragably proved either that this perverse mr higginbotham
was alive when he wrote it or as some deemed the more probable case
of two doubtful ones that he was so absorbed in worldly business as
to continue to transact it even after his death but unexpected
evidence was forthcoming the young lady after listening to the
pedler's explanation merely seized a moment to smooth her gown and
put her curls in order and then appeared at the tavern door making a
modest signal to be heard

good people said she i am mr higginbotham's niece

a wondering murmur passed through the crowd on beholding her so rosy
and bright that same unhappy niece whom they had supposed on the
authority of the parker's falls gazette to be lying at death's
door in a fainting-fit but some shrewd fellows had doubted all along
whether a young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of a
rich old uncle

you see continued miss higginbotham with a smile that this
strange story is quite unfounded as to myself and i believe i may
affirm it to be equally so in regard to my dear uncle higginbotham he
has the kindness to give me a home in his house though i contribute
to my own support by teaching a school i left kimballton this morning
to spend the vacation of commencement-week with a friend about five
miles from parker's falls my generous uncle when he heard me on the
stairs called me to his bedside and gave me two dollars and fifty
cents to pay my stage-fare and another dollar for my extra expenses
he then laid his pocketbook under his pillow shook hands with me and
advised me to take some biscuit in my bag instead of breakfasting on
the road i feel confident therefore that i left my beloved relative
alive and trust that i shall find him so on my return

the young lady courtesied at the close of her speech which was so
sensible and well worded and delivered with such grace and propriety
that everybody thought her fit to be preceptress of the best academy
in the state but a stranger would have supposed that mr higginbotham
was an object of abhorrence at parker's falls and that a thanksgiving
had been proclaimed for his murder so excessive was the wrath of the
inhabitants on learning their mistake the mill-men resolved to bestow
public honors on dominicus pike only hesitating whether to tar and
feather him ride him on a rail or refresh him with an ablution at the
town-pump on the top of which he had declared himself the bearer of
the news the selectmen by advice of the lawyer spoke of prosecuting
him for a misdemeanor in circulating unfounded reports to the great
disturbance of the peace of the commonwealth nothing saved dominicus
either from mob-law or a court of justice but an eloquent appeal made
by the young lady in his behalf addressing a few words of heartfelt
gratitude to his benefactress he mounted the green cart and rode out
of town under a discharge of artillery from the schoolboys who found
plenty of ammunition in the neighboring clay-pits and mud-holes as he
turned his head to exchange a farewell glance with mr higginbotham's
niece a ball of the consistence of hasty-pudding hit him slap in the
mouth giving him a most grim aspect his whole person was so
bespattered with the like filthy missiles that he had almost a mind to
ride back and supplicate for the threatened ablution at the town-pump
for though not meant in kindness it would now have been a deed of
charity

however the sun shone bright on poor dominicus and the mud an
emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium was easily brushed off
when dry being a funny rogue his heart soon cheered up nor could he
refrain from a hearty laugh at the uproar which his story had excited
the handbills of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the
vagabonds in the state the paragraph in the parker's falls gazette
would be reprinted from maine to florida and perhaps form an item in
the london newspapers and many a miser would tremble for his
moneybags and life on learning the catastrophe of mr higginbotham
the pedler meditated with much fervor on the charms of the young
schoolmistress and swore that daniel webster never spoke nor looked
so like an angel as miss higginbotham while defending him from the
wrathful populace at parker's falls

dominicus was now on the kimballton turnpike having all along
determined to visit that place though business had drawn him out of
the most direct road from morristown as he approached the scene of
the supposed murder he continued to revolve the circumstances in his
mind and was astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed
had nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first traveller
it might now have been considered as a hoax but the yellow man was
evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact and there was
a mystery in his dismayed and guilty look on being abruptly
questioned when to this singular combination of incidents it was
added that the rumor tallied exactly with mr higginbotham's character
and habits of life and that he had an orchard and a st michael's
pear tree near which he always passed at nightfall the
circumstantial evidence appeared so strong that dominicus doubted
whether the autograph produced by the lawyer or even the niece's
direct testimony ought to be equivalent making cautious inquiries
along the road the pedler further learned that mr higginbotham had
in his service an irishman of doubtful character whom he had hired
without a recommendation on the score of economy

may i be hanged myself exclaimed dominicus pike aloud on reaching
the top of a lonely hill if i'll believe old higginbotham is
unhanged till i see him with my own eyes and hear it from his own
mouth and as he's a real shaver i'll have the minister or some
other responsible man for an endorser

it was growing dusk when he reached the toll-house on kimballton
turnpike about a quarter of a mile from the village of this name his
little mare was fast bringing him up with a man on horseback who
trotted through the gate a few rods in advance of him nodded to the
toll-gatherer and kept on towards the village dominicus was
acquainted with the toll-man and while making change the usual
remarks on the weather passed between them

i suppose said the pedler throwing back his whiplash to bring it
down like a feather on the mare's flank you have not seen anything
of old mr higginbotham within a day or two

yes answered the toll-gatherer he passed the gate just before you
drove up and yonder he rides now if you can see him through the
dusk he's been to woodfield this afternoon attending a sheriff's
sale there the old man generally shakes hands and has a little chat
with me but to-night he nodded as if to say charge my toll and
jogged on for wherever he goes he must always be at home by eight
o'clock

so they tell me said dominicus

i never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the squire does
continued the toll-gatherer says i to myself tonight he's more
like a ghost or an old mummy than good flesh and blood

the pedler strained his eyes through the twilight and could just
discern the horseman now far ahead on the village road he seemed to
recognize the rear of mr higginbotham but through the evening
shadows and amid the dust from the horse's feet the figure appeared
dim and unsubstantial as if the shape of the mysterious old man were
faintly moulded of darkness and gray light

dominicus shivered mr higginbotham has come back from the other
world by way of the kimballton turnpike thought he he shook the
reins and rode forward keeping about the same distance in the rear of
the gray old shadow till the latter was concealed by a bend of the
road on reaching this point the pedler no longer saw the man on
horseback but found himself at the head of the village street not
far from a number of stores and two taverns clustered round the
meeting-house steeple on his left was a stone wall and a gate the
boundary of a wood-lot beyond which lay an orchard farther still a
mowing-field and last of all a house these were the premises of mr
higginbotham whose dwelling stood beside the old highway but had
been left in the background by the kimballton turnpike

dominicus knew the place and the little mare stopped short by
instinct for he was not conscious of tightening the reins for the
soul of me i cannot get by this gate said he trembling i never
shall be my own man again till i see whether mr higginbotham is
hanging on the st michael's pear tree he leaped from the cart gave
the rein a turn round the gate-post and ran along the green path of
the wood-lot as if old nick were chasing behind just then the village
clock tolled eight and as each deep stroke fell dominicus gave a
fresh bound and flew faster than before till dim in the solitary
centre of the orchard he saw the fated pear tree one great branch
stretched from the old contorted trunk across the path and threw the
darkest shadow on that one spot but something seemed to struggle
beneath the branch

the pedler had never pretended to more courage than befits a man of
peaceable occupation nor could he account for his valor on this awful
emergency certain it is however that he rushed forward prostrated
a sturdy irishman with the butt-end of his whip and found not
indeed hanging on the st michael's pear tree but trembling beneath
it with a halter round his neck the old identical mr higginbotham

mr higginbotham said dominicus tremulously you're an honest
man and i'll take your word for it have you been hanged or not

if the riddle be not already guessed a few words will explain the
simple machinery by which this coming event was made to cast its
shadow before three men had plotted the robbery and murder of mr
higginbotham two of them successively lost courage and fled each
delaying the crime one night by their disappearance the third was in
the act of perpetration when a champion blindly obeying the call of
fate like the heroes of old romance appeared in the person of
dominicus pike

it only remains to say that mr higginbotham took the pedler into high
favor sanctioned his addresses to the pretty schoolmistress and
settled his whole property on their children allowing themselves the
interest in due time the old gentleman capped the climax of his
favors by dying a christian death in bed since which melancholy
event dominicus pike has removed from kimballton and established a
large tobacco-manufactory in my native village




little annie's ramble


ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong

the town-crier has rung his bell at a distant corner and little annie
stands on her father's doorsteps trying to hear what the man with the
loud voice is talking about let me listen too oh he is telling the
people that an elephant and a lion and a royal tiger and a horse with
horns and other strange beasts from foreign countries have come to
town and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them
perhaps little annie would like to go yes and i can see that the
pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street with the green
trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine and the pavements
and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them
with her broom she feels that impulse to go strolling away that
longing after the mystery of the great world which many children
feel and which i felt in my childhood little annie shall take a
ramble with me see i do but hold out my hand and like some bright
bird in the sunny air with her blue silk frock fluttering upward from
her white pantalets she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street

smooth back your brown curls annie and let me tie on your bonnet
and we will set forth what a strange couple to go on their rambles
together one walks in black attire with a measured step and a heavy
brow and his thoughtful eyes bent down while the gay little girl
trips lightly along as if she were forced to keep hold of my hand lest
her feet should dance away from the earth yet there is sympathy
between us if i pride myself on anything it is because i have a
smile that children love and on the other hand there are few grown
ladies that could entice me from the side of little annie for i
delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless
child so come annie but if i moralize as we go do not listen to
me only look about you and be merry

now we turn the corner here are hacks with two horses and
stage-coaches with four thundering to meet each other and trucks and
carts moving at a slower pace being heavily laden with barrels from
the wharves and here are rattling gigs which perhaps will be smashed
to pieces before our eyes hitherward also comes a man trundling a
wheelbarrow along the pavement is not little annie afraid of such a
tumult no she does not even shrink closer to my side but passes on
with fearless confidence a happy child amidst a great throng of grown
people who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to
extreme old age nobody jostles her all turn aside to make way for
little annie and what is most singular she appears conscious of her
claim to such respect now her eyes brighten with pleasure a
street-musician has seated himself on the steps of yonder church and
pours forth his strains to the busy town a melody that has gone
astray among the tramp of footsteps the buzz of voices and the war of
passing wheels who heeds the poor organ-grinder none but myself and
little annie whose feet begin to move in unison with the lively tune
as if she were loth that music should be wasted without a dance but
where would annie find a partner some have the gout in their toes or
the rheumatism in their joints some are stiff with age some feeble
with disease some are so lean that their bones would rattle and
others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the
flagstones but many many have leaden feet because their hearts are
far heavier than lead it is a sad thought that i have chanced upon
what a company of dancers should we be for i too am a gentleman of
sober footsteps and therefore little annie let us walk sedately on

it is a question with me whether this giddy child or my sage self have
most pleasure in looking at the shop-windows we love the silks of
sunny hue that glow within the darkened premises of the spruce
dry-goods men we are pleasantly dazzled by the burnished silver and
the chased gold the rings of wedlock and the costly love-ornaments
glistening at the window of the jeweller but annie more than i
seeks for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty looking-glasses
at the hardware-stores all that is bright and gay attracts us both

here is a shop to which the recollections of my boyhood as well as
present partialities give a peculiar magic how delightful to let the
fancy revel on the dainties of a confectioner those pies with such
white and flaky paste their contents being a mystery whether rich
mince with whole plums intermixed or piquant apple delicately
rose-flavored those cakes heart-shaped or round piled in a lofty
pyramid those sweet little circlets sweetly named kisses those dark
majestic masses fit to be bridal-loaves at the wedding of an heiress
mountains in size their summits deeply snow-covered with sugar then
the mighty treasures of sugarplums white and crimson and yellow in
large glass vases and candy of all varieties and those little
cockles or whatever they are called much prized by children for
their sweetness and more for the mottoes which they enclose by
love-sick maids and bachelors oh my mouth waters little annie and
so doth yours but we will not be tempted except to an imaginary
feast so let us hasten onward devouring the vision of a plum-cake

here are pleasures as some people would say of a more exalted kind
in the window of a bookseller is annie a literary lady yes she is
deeply read in peter parley's tomes and has an increasing love for
fairy-tales though seldom met with nowadays and she will subscribe
next year to the juvenile miscellany but truth to tell she
is apt to turn away from the printed page and keep gazing at the
pretty pictures such as the gay-colored ones which make this
shop-window the continual loitering-place of children what would
annie think if in the book which i mean to send her on new year's
day she should find her sweet little self bound up in silk or morocco
with gilt edges there to remain till she become a woman grown with
children of her own to read about their mother's childhood that would
be very queer

little annie is weary of pictures and pulls me onward by the hand
till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town oh
my stars is this a toyshop or is it fairy-land for here are gilded
chariots in which the king and queen of the fairies might ride side by
side while their courtiers on these small horses should gallop in
triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair here too are
dishes of chinaware fit to be the dining-set of those same princely
personages when they make a regal banquet in the stateliest hall of
their palace full five feet high and behold their nobles feasting
adown the long perspective of the table betwixt the king and queen
should sit my little annie the prettiest fairy of them all here
stands a turbaned turk threatening us with his sabre like an ugly
heathen as he is and next a chinese mandarin who nods his head at
annie and myself here we may review a whole army of horse and foot in
red-and-blue uniforms with drums fifes trumpets and all kinds of
noiseless music they have halted on the shelf of this window after
their weary march from liliput but what cares annie for soldiers no
conquering queen is she neither a semiramis nor a catharine her
whole heart is set upon that doll who gazes at us with such a
fashionable stare this is the little girl's true plaything though
made of wood a doll is a visionary and ethereal personage endowed by
childish fancy with a peculiar life the mimic lady is a heroine of
romance an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scenes the
chief inhabitant of that wild world with which children ape the real
one little annie does not understand what i am saying but looks
wishfully at the proud lady in the window we will invite her home
with us as we return meantime good-bye dame doll a toy yourself
you look forth from your window upon many ladies that are also toys
though they walk and speak and upon a crowd in pursuit of toys
though they wear grave visages oh with your never-closing eyes had
you but an intellect to moralize on all that flits before them what a
wise doll would you be come little annie we shall find toys
enough go where we may

now we elbow our way among the throng again it is curious in the most
crowded part of a town to meet with living creatures that had their
birthplace in some far solitude but have acquired a second nature in
the wilderness of men look up annie at that canary-bird hanging out
of the window in his cage poor little fellow his golden feathers are
all tarnished in this smoky sunshine he would have glistened twice as
brightly among the summer islands but still he has become a citizen
in all his tastes and habits and would not sing half so well without
the uproar that drowns his music what a pity that he does not know
how miserable he is there is a parrot too calling out pretty
poll pretty poll as we pass by foolish bird to be talking about
her prettiness to strangers especially as she is not a pretty poll
though gaudily dressed in green and yellow if she had said pretty
annie there would have been some sense in it see that gray squirrel
at the door of the fruit-shop whirling round and round so merrily
within his wire wheel being condemned to the treadmill he makes it
an amusement admirable philosophy

here comes a big rough dog a countryman's dog in search of his
master smelling at everybody's heels and touching little annie's hand
with his cold nose but hurrying away though she would fain have
patted him success to your search fidelity and there sits a great
yellow cat upon a window-sill a very corpulent and comfortable cat
gazing at this transitory world with owl's eyes and making pithy
comments doubtless or what appear such to the silly beast oh
sage puss make room for me beside you and we will be a pair of
philosophers

here we see something to remind us of the town-crier and his
ding-dong-bell look look at that great cloth spread out in the air
pictured all over with wild beasts as if they had met together to
choose a king according to their custom in the days of æsop but they
are choosing neither a king nor a president else we should hear a
most horrible snarling they have come from the deep woods and the
wild mountains and the desert sands and the polar snows only to do
homage to my little annie as we enter among them the great elephant
makes us a bow in the best style of elephantine courtesy bending
lowly down his mountain bulk with trunk abased and leg thrust out
behind annie returns the salute much to the gratification of the
elephant who is certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan the
lion and the lioness are busy with two beef-bones the royal tiger
the beautiful the untamable keeps pacing his narrow cage with a
haughty step unmindful of the spectators or recalling the fierce
deeds of his former life when he was wont to leap forth upon such
inferior animals from the jungles of bengal

here we see the very same wolf do not go near him annie the
selfsame wolf that devoured little red riding-hood and her
grandmother in the next cage a hyena from egypt who has doubtless
howled around the pyramids and a black bear from our own forests are
fellow-prisoners and most excellent friends are there any two living
creatures who have so few sympathies that they cannot possibly be
friends here sits a great white bear whom common observers would call
a very stupid beast though i perceive him to be only absorbed in
contemplation he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg and of his
comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole and of the little
cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows in fact he is a bear
of sentiment but oh those unsentimental monkeys the ugly grinning
aping chattering ill-natured mischievous and queer little brutes
annie does not love the monkeys their ugliness shocks her pure
instinctive delicacy of taste and makes her mind unquiet because it
bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity but here is a little
pony just big enough for annie to ride and round and round he gallops
in a circle keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music
and here with a laced coat and a cocked hat and a riding-whip in his
hand here comes a little gentleman small enough to be king of the
fairies and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes and takes a flying
leap into the saddle merrily merrily plays the music and merrily
gallops the pony and merrily rides the little old gentleman come
annie into the street again perchance we may see monkeys on
horseback there

mercy on us what a noisy world we quiet people live in did annie
ever read the cries of london city with what lusty lungs doth yonder
man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters here comes
another mounted on a cart and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast
from a tin horn as much as to say fresh fish and hark a voice on
high like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque announcing
that some chimney-sweeper has emerged from smoke and soot and darksome
caverns into the upper air what cares
